HEADLINE: A Climate and Energy Stalemate

BYLINE: JOHN M. BRODER


HIGHLIGHT: Is climate change a real and present danger? Why does the United States lag behind many other industrialized nations in addressing it? 

 BODY:
On the day he clinched the Democratic nomination for president in 2008, Barack Obama declared that future generations would look back and say, "This was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal." He made addressing climate change, domestically and as part of a concerted international effort, a central tenet of his campaign platform and a top priority of his first year in office.
The Agenda: Planet
The lagging U.S. response to climate change.
Then the president backed off, hamstrung by an economic crisis and implacable opposition from Republicans, who were cheered on and financed by their ideological allies and fossil fuel companies. International talks organized by the United Nations made scant progress, not least because the United States was unwilling to accept a binding accord unless it required comparable emissions cuts by all countries regardless of their stage of economic development.
As Mr. Obama seeks re-election, a warming climate and its related challenges -- more frequent droughts and wildfires, rising seas and more violent storms -- are near the bottom of the national agenda. The Republicans, some of whom as recently as four years ago shared Democrats' concern about a warming climate and advocated a market-based approach known as cap and trade to reduce climate-altering emissions, are nearly unanimous in questioning whether global warming even exists. Democrats, burned by the Senate's rejection of legislation addressing climate change and wary of any policy that could be portrayed as raising energy costs, have fallen silent on the topic.
The public is divided, with fervent minorities at either end of the debate and a broad crowd in the middle that believes that human activity is altering the climate but remains conflicted over what government, corporations and individuals should do about it. Attuned to the public's ambivalence, both political parties and their presidential candidates are playing down the climate issue. Instead, what passes for an energy debate in the United States is rivalry over which party is more devoted to extracting oil and gas from the ground and the seabed.
Over the new few months, we hope to jump-start a discussion about energy and climate policy in the United States. We'll have experts weigh in and welcome readers' opinions on broad questions that may be neglected on the campaign trail.
Is climate change a real and present danger? Why does the United States lag behind many other industrialized nations in addressing it? Do Americans need to reduce their energy consumption? Should there be limits to where and when and how they drill for oil, frack for gas and mine coal? How far should regulators go in trying to reduce air pollution and emissions of greenhouse gases? Should the federal government subsidize alternative sources of energy like the sun, wind and biofuels?
In campaigns past, those complex issues have been reduced to slogans like "Drill, baby, drill" or simplistic calls to eliminate the Energy Department or the Environmental Protection Agency. With your help, we'll try to dig a little deeper.

HEADLINE: Geithner Faces Senate on Rate-Rigging Scandal

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Congress intensified its focus on the interest-rate rigging scandal on Thursday, as Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, vowed that authorities would forcefully pursue criminal investigations into some of the world's biggest banks. 

 BODY:
Congress intensified its focus on the interest-rate rigging scandal on Thursday, as Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, vowed that authorities would forcefully pursue criminal investigations into some of the world's biggest banks.
In testimony before a Senate panel, the second Congressional hearing this week to focus on Mr. Geithner, he promoted the government's efforts to punish banks that tried to manipulate a benchmark interest rate during the financial crisis. He also deflected questions about his response to the wrongdoing, which occurred in 2008 when he ran the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which focused on reforming the rate-setting process rather than halting the illegal actions.
Authorities around the world are investigating whether more than a dozen big banks manipulated the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, a measure of how much banks charge to lend to one another. The benchmark rate underpins trillions of dollars in mortgages and other loans.
 "We cannot lose sight of the fact that the Libor issue, at its core, is about fraud," Senator Tim Johnson, Democrat of South Dakota and chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said at the hearing on Thursday. "I want you to commit to me and the American people that the administration will make sure that those involved in Libor fraud will be held accountable and prosecuted."
"Absolutely," Mr. Geithner replied. "I'm very confident that the Department of Justice and the relevant enforcement agencies will meet that objective."
Last month, Barclays settled accusations that it undermined Libor to aid profits and deflect concerns about its health, the first action to come from the multiyear investigation. The British bank agreed to pay $450 million to authorities.
Republicans, however, took aim at Mr. Geithner for his somewhat passive approach to the Barclays fraud.
In April 2008, the New York Fed learned that Barclays had been artificially depressing its rates. "We know that we're not posting, um, an honest" rate, a Barclays employee told a New York Fed official. At the time, Mr. Geithner ran the regional Fed bank.
But when Mr. Geithner discussed Libor with other American regulators in May 2008, he did not disclose the specific wrongdoing at Barclays. He also stopped short of referring the matter to the Justice Department.
"He, too, may have tempered his response," said Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the ranking Republican on the committee. The statement echoed Republican criticism at a House Financial Services Committee hearing on Wednesday, where Mr. Geithner faced an even sharper attack.
At both hearings, Mr. Geithner pushed back on the critique, citing his May 2008 conversations with other regulators. He also noted the New York Fed pressed for an overhaul of the rate-setting process. In a June 2008 e-mail to the Bank of England, the country's central bank, Mr. Geithner recommended that British officials "eliminate incentive to misreport" Libor.
"I believe that we did the necessary and appropriate thing,' he said on Thursday. 
Democrats also came to his defense.
"There are some who seek to put the entire blame on the cops," Mr. Johnson said. "But it would be a mistake to shift the focus away from the continued effort to hold the companies and individuals who committed fraud accountable."
Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, cheered Mr. Geithner for being "the only guy who actually sounded the alarm."
For his part, Mr. Geithner acknowledged that Libor was the most recent scandal in a string of Wall Street blowups. The problems, he said, have delivered an enduring black eye to the financial industry.
"We've seen a devastating loss of trust in the integrity of the financial system."
An earlier version of this post misspelled the name of the senator from Alabama who serves as the ranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee. It is Richard C. Shelby, not Selby.

HEADLINE: Middle East Journal: Why I Went to Kuwait

BYLINE: PAUL DOWNS


HIGHLIGHT: The call from Kuwait got us thinking about selling our tables abroad. And so we entered the world of government export programs. 

 BODY:
In June I made a lightning visit to the Middle East. I spent one day in Dubai and two in Kuwait, visiting local furniture dealers. This was an attempt to start building some long-term relationships in the region with the goal of exporting our tables. Those of you who have followed my blogging probably would not have predicted that this would be the next step in building my business. But the opportunity arose out of the blue, with an unsolicited call from a potential client in Kuwait, and it snowballed from there.
Because our tables have a prominent Web presence, I get inquiries from people all around the world. This has been going on since Google found our work in 2003. It's usually just a few calls each year, but they come from surprising places, including Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Jordan, Syria, Libya, the Ivory Coast, Venezuela, Cuba (actually, Guantanamo Bay), Turkey, and Singapore.
I usually check out their workplaces using Google Maps, just to make sure they exist, and I can often get a good look at their buildings on Google Street View. It's a quick way to weed out scammers. Then we talk on the phone, generally via Skype. So far, none of these jobs has gone anywhere, but exporting has been in the back of my mind since we mastered the logistics of shipping tables around the country. If we can move a table from Philadelphia to Seattle without difficulty, there's little reason to think we can't send it across the ocean. What would happen upon arrival is the problem -- we don't have a good way to find local brokers who can deal with customs and arrange local deliveries on a one-off basis. 
The call from Kuwait was for a sizable amount of work -- five tables for a proposed ministry building. The details provided were vague, but I arranged a phone call with the person who had e-mailed me, and we spoke for about half an hour. In the end, I couldn't quite figure out how to proceed, but I sent some cost estimates. And then I heard nothing.
It's funny how hiring the right person can change a problem into an opportunity. A little over a year ago I decided that I was tired of doing routine paperwork, and I hired an administrative assistant, part time, to deal with that chore. I was extraordinarily fortunate in my choice. Mary is the wife of a retired diplomat who moved to our area a few years ago, and became good friends with my wife. She was looking for part-time work, I needed a part-time assistant, and the match was made. Intelligent, organized, and capable, she has had many jobs, including working for a large engineering firm.
Having spent many years overseas, posted to various American embassies with her husband, she has lots of experience with the various arms of the federal government that operate abroad. When the inquiry came from Kuwait in February, she made a few calls to former colleagues and soon made contact with one of the commercial officers there. That person had never heard of the firm that contacted us but said that there was plenty of business going on in Kuwait and the Middle East in general. And, he assured us, American goods are held in high regard there -- with a reputation for very high quality.
Mary and I agreed this was an interesting possibility and that we should spend some time investigating how we could do it. We thought that if we could find local partners to handle the importing process and arrange delivery, it would be feasible to ship our tables overseas. And so we entered the world of government export programs.
It turns out there are legions of eager government people and scores of different programs intended to help small businesses sell their products overseas. We looked into programs that are run by the state of Pennsylvania, the Commerce Department, and the World Trade Center. We had a representative from the Philadelphia center of the Commerce Department come and visit us to discuss our abilities, and in the end we decided to try the Commerce Department's Gold Key matching service.
This started with a questionnaire intended to pinpoint our abilities and the kind of business we wanted to do. The next step was a consultation, by conference call, with the local trade officers. These people then made calls in their local countries to see if anyone wanted to meet us. It costs $300 per country to do this -- not much, considering the service. We did a Gold Key for Kuwait and, to my surprise, there were five local companies that wanted to see me. The trade officer in Kuwait assured me that these were large and reputable outfits, and a little Web searching verified this.
At this point, I started to take the whole thing more seriously, and I looked into flights to Kuwait. It turned out that in order to get there, I would need to pass through Dubai, so we did a Gold Key there as well and turned up three more potential partners. We also applied for a Pennsylvania program that would split my travel costs (the Global Access Program, funded in part by the Small Business Administration), and it all started to look like a real possibility.
I'm not an eager traveler, and I was committed to go to Germany in late April, so I put the trip off for as long as I could. But Mary kept applying gentle pressure, and we kept hearing from the Kuwait and Dubai people that they were looking forward to my visit, so I booked a flight for early June. I would fly out on Saturday evening, arrive in Dubai on Sunday afternoon, stay overnight, have four meetings in Dubai on Monday, fly to Kuwait on Monday evening, have three meetings in Kuwait on Tuesday, then two more on Wednesday morning, then fly back to Dubai at dinnertime and fly out of at midnight -- arriving home on Thursday morning. It would be a high-speed, high-intensity visit.
It turned out that I knew quite a few people who had been to the Middle East, and got lots of helpful advice: "Bring a gift." "Fly Emirates if you can." "Don't worry, everyone speaks English." (I'd been burned on that one in Germany, so I was a little skeptical.) "You'll be fine." That turned out to be true. It was a long flight -- 13 hours from Dulles to Dubai. But I had upgraded my seat to Economy Plus and was darn glad I did. We flew through the night and the morning and landed in Dubai in mid afternoon.
I'll tell you more in the following posts, but the meetings I had in both Dubai and Kuwait were fruitful. It appears that doing business in the Middle East will be much like doing business anywhere: provide a good product, make some friends, and the opportunities can be converted into revenue. My hosts were invariably gracious and interested, and I found my enthusiasm for the project growing with each meeting. That said, it's going to be a while before I see any return on my investment.
Still, the cost so far has not been outrageous, and one thing that happened to me in Dubai made the whole thing worthwhile even if we never sell a table there. Through an odd sequence of events, I got the chance to tour a woodworking factory run by a local trading company and staffed by imported workers. They do work almost exactly like ours, but with a very different economic model. I'll talk more about that in the next post.

HEADLINE: July 26: The Calm Before Critical Economic News

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: Mr. Obama's chances of winning the Electoral College rose in our model, to 66.4 percent from 65.0 percent, mostly because the stock market gain slightly bolstered the model's economic index. 

 BODY:
Thursday was a rare day of decent economic news for President Obama. The Department of Labor showed initial unemployment claims declining, and the stock market was up more than 200 points as investors bought into assurances by the chief of the European Central Bank that he would do "whatever it takes" to save the euro zone. 
A series of critical economic reports is set to be released in the next week, including the government's initial estimate of second-quarter G.D.P. growth on Friday, and the monthly jobs report a week from Friday. 
In addition, the Federal Reserve will hold a meeting next week, during which it could plausibly choose to enact a third round of quantitative easing.
The polling news was mixed for the candidates. A survey in Missouri showed Mitt Romney well ahead there, and another in New Jersey showed a smaller lead for Mr. Obama than others in the state. But Mr. Obama got a stronger number in a Nevada poll, a more critical state in the Electoral College, which put him ahead by five points there.
Mr. Obama's chances of winning the Electoral College rose in our model, to 66.4 percent from 65.0 percent, mostly because the stock market gain slightly bolstered the model's economic index.

Movies
Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases: nytimes.com/movies.
'Alps' (No rating, 1:33, in English and Greek) In this eccentric, quietly troubling quasi-allegory from the Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos, a semi-secret group devotes itself to impersonating the recently deceased, with ambiguous results. (A. O. Scott)
'The Amazing Spider-Man' (PG-13, 2:16) Five years after Sam Rami directed his third ''Spider-Man'' installment, Marc Webb returns this lucrative franchise to its origins with Andrew Garfield as the spider-teenager and Emma Stone as the girl. Painless but unnecessary. (Manohla Dargis) 
- 'Beasts of the Southern Wild' (PG-13, 1:33) A blast of joyful, chaotic emotion from the bayou, Benh Zeitlin's dazzling film is a homegrown magic-realist fable of defiance in the face of hardship. A community in a stretch of coastal Louisiana called the Bathtub is menaced by storms and government benevolence. Their ordeal is narrated by a young girl named Hushpuppy (Quvenzhane Wallis ), who lives with her father, Wink (Dwight Henry), and who belongs in the tradition of Huck Finn, Scout Finch, Eloise and other indomitable American child heroes. (Scott)
- 'The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel' (PG-13, 2:04) This staid but likable story of British retirees starting a new life in India insists that it is never too late to leave your comfort zone and explore new horizons. Besides its sterling cast (Judi Dench, Tom Wilkinson, Maggie Smith), its ace in the hole is its pungent depiction of Jaipur's teeming streets. (Stephen Holden)
'Brave' (PG, 1:33) After 17 years of feature filmmaking, Pixar has -- ta-da! -- its first female protagonist, Merida, a brave, ginger-mopped princess who wants to chart her own fate. The animation, as might be expected, is beautiful, but the story is filled with dreary gender cliches. Mark Andrews and Brenda Chapman directed and helped write the script. (Dargis)
- 'A Cat in Paris' (PG, 1:10) This animated caper about art thieves, detectives, a young girl and her loyal cat is silly, suspenseful and whimsically immune to the laws of physics or probability. (Scott)
'China Heavyweight' (No rating, 1:29, in Mandarin and Sichuan dialect) Yung Chang's dispassionate yet tender look at the aspirational lure of Chinese amateur boxing programs follows two childhood friends as they deal with a punishing training schedule and the tension between individual ambition and national identity. (Jeannette Catsoulis)
- 'The Dark Knight Rises' (PG-13, 2:44) After seven years and two films that have pushed Batman (Christian Bale) ever deeper into the dark, the director Christopher Nolan has completed his postmodern, post-Sept. 11 epic of ambivalent good versus multidimensional evil with a burst of light. (Dargis)
- 'Easy Money' (No rating, 2:04, in Swedish, Serbian, English and Spanish) Joel Kinnaman (''The Killing'') gives a riveting portrayal of a corrupt, social climbing business student in this Swedish gangster film about coke dealing, money laundering and ethnic warfare among international drug dealers. It is one of the finest gangster films of the last decade. (Holden)
- 'Farewell, My Queen' (R, 1:40, in French) Benoit Jacquot directs this tense, absorbing, pleasurably original look at Marie Antoinette (Diane Kruger) after the fall of the Bastille, a story that's told from the blinkered perspective of the doomed queen's infatuated reader (Lea Seydoux). (Dargis)
'First Position' (No rating, 1:30, in English, Spanish, French and Hebrew) The tears are often held tremulously back and the many hurts smiled away in Bess Kargman's appealing, largely upbeat documentary about young ballet dancers duking it out, sometimes on point and in tulle, for top honors at the Youth America Grand Prix. (Dargis)
'Hara-Kiri: Death of a Samurai' (No rating, 2:06, in Japanese) The prolific Japanese genre director Takashi Miike (''Audition,''''13 Assassins'') tries out a quiet, almost Classical style in this sad and stately tale set in a quasi-mythic 17th century. Mr. Miike's debt to an earlier cinematic tradition is evident in spite of his distracting use of 3-D, which adds nothing to the gravity of his story. (Scott)
'Headhunters' (R, 1:40, in Norwegian and Danish) The relentless adaptation of a novel by the Norwegian author Jo Nesbo follows a corporate headhunter -- and part-time art thief -- as he is chased and tormented by a potential mark who turns dangerous. (Nicolas Rapold)
'The Hunger Games' (PG-13, 2:22) Jennifer Lawrence stars as Katniss, the teenage warrior from Suzanne Collins's book trilogy. The director Gary Ross has too soft a touch, but the film is insistently watchable partly because of how the story radically revisits -- and re-sexes -- the classic figure of the American Adam. (Dargis)
'Ice Age: Continental Drift' (PG, 1:34) The further adventures of prehistoric creatures voiced by modern celebrities. As usual, Scrat is the best part. (Scott)
- 'The Imposter' (R, 1:35) Slippery, manipulative and shamelessly entertaining, Bart Layton's bizarre true-crime documentary follows the twisty tale of a missing Texas teenager and the French-Algerian con artist who stole his identity. (Catsoulis)
'The Intouchables' (R, 1:52, in French) In this buddy movie from France, a rich white guy (Francois Cluzet), paralyzed from the neck down, is cared for by an African immigrant (Omar Sy) who teaches his boss to loosen up and appreciate life. The film's unabashed embrace of racial stereotypes may startle American audiences -- the movie was a huge hit in France -- but there is appealing warmth to the performances and an overall mood of friendly tolerance. It's embarrassing, but not as bad as it might have been. (Scott)
'Jiro Dreams of Sushi' (No rating, 1:21, in Japanese) Jiro Ono, an octogenarian sushi master, and his tiny, Michelin-lauded Tokyo restaurant get a flattering spotlight in David Gelb's foodie-friendly debut documentary. (Nicolas Rapold)
'Katy Perry: Part of Me' (PG, 1:33) This 3-D backstage doc follows Ms. Perry -- if you don't know, ask any 12-year-old girl -- through hundreds of costume changes and the breakup of her marriage to the British comedian Russell Brand. While the film, true to its title, does not reveal a whole lot about its subject, it does succeed in presenting her as a likable professional, serious about her craft and generous to her fans. (Scott)
'Kumare' (No rating, 1:24) Vikram Gandhi's documentary, about his experiences posing as a swami who gathers a following in Arizona, is an intriguing if too-sketchy film about a stunt that unexpectedly became a serious mini-movement when he found himself taken seriously as a spiritual leader. (Holden)
'Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted' (PG, 1:33) The characters haven't changed radically, nor has the humor. But the scale of this billion-dollar grossing DreamWorks Animation franchise has grown. The latest installment -- in which the animals Alex, Marty, Gloria and Melman join a circus on the Continent -- benefits from a nice supporting cast (Bryan Cranston, Jessica Chastain), clever 3-D effects and a dazzling Cirque du Soleil-style big-top sequence rendered with a pastel palette. (Andy Webster)
- 'Magic Mike' (R, 1:50) At this point in his remarkable career, the director Steven Soderbergh can do just about anything, including making a funny, sly, relevant movie about a male stripper (Channing Tatum) into this summer's surprise must-see. (Dargis)
'Marina Abramovic the Artist Is Present' (No rating, 1:46) Matthew Aker's documentary, chronicling the career of Ms. Abramovic, a Yugoslav-born performance artist, is more celebratory than illuminating, but it does provide a useful overview of her work, especially the Museum of Modern Art piece -- in which she sat silently in a chair every day for three months -- that gives the film its name. (Scott)
'Marvel's The Avengers' (PG-13, 2:22) Thor, the Hulk, Iron Man, Captain America and a few other mighty Marvel superheroes team up under the supervision of Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury in this franchise juggernaut, directed by Joss Whedon. The bantering and riffing among the characters provides some fun, but there is not much heart or imagination in the story or the action sequences. Which seems to satisfy the fans just fine. (Scott)
'Men in Black 3' (PG-13, 1:43) There was perhaps no pressing need for another installment in this spoofy, silly franchise about a duo of intrepid alien-hunters (Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith), but this sequel is refreshingly witty and playful (as well as predictably hectic and loud). Agent J (Mr. Smith) travels back to a candy-coated 1969, where he encounters his partner, K, as a younger man played by Josh Brolin, who represents one of several bits of casting ingenuity. The best of these is Michael Stuhlbarg as a sensitive and soulful alien with an unusual sense of time. (Scott)
- 'Monsieur Lazhar' (PG-13, 1:34, in French) This story, of an Algerian teacher seeking political asylum in Quebec who takes a job as a middle-school teacher, sustains an exquisite balance between a grown-up and a child's-eye view of education, teacher-student relations and peer group interaction. The students come quirkily alive in superb naturalistic performances devoid of cuteness and stereotyping. (Holden)
- 'Moonrise Kingdom' (PG-13, 1:34) In Wes Anderson's latest, a wondrous storybook tale, a girl and a boy, both 12, run off to a remote inlet on an island where most of the adults seem disappointed and more than a little sad. The two are very serious -- about love, their plans, books, life itself -- and often act older than their age. You wonder what their hurry is, given that here adulthood, with its quarrels, regrets and anguished pillow talk, can feel as dangerous as the storm that's hurtling toward the island, ready to blow it all down. With Bill Murray, Bruce Willis and Frances McDormand. (Dargis)
'Pina' (No rating, 1:46, in German, English, Russian, Italian, French, Slovenian, Korean, Spanish and Portuguese) Wim Wenders's 3-D documentary pays vivid tribute to the life and work of Pina Bausch, the German choreographer who died in 2009, leaving behind a corps of devoted dancers and a corpus of provocative and powerful dances. (Scott)
'Prometheus' (R, 2:03) This sort-of prequel to ''Alien,'' directed by Ridley Scott, is visually sumptuous, often spooky and suspenseful, but ultimately disappointing. Marrying the visceral punch and scrappy heroism of the original to cosmic inquiries into the nature of human existence, the film sets out large ambitions that unravel as the plot turns pedestrian and illogical. Noomi Rapace as an intrepid scientist and Michael Fassbender as a soulful robot are part of an ensemble that does what it can to sustain the credibility of the enterprise. (Scott)
- 'The Queen of Versailles' (PG, 1:40) Lauren Greenfield's documentary follows the shifting fortunes of David and Jackie Siegel, a wealthy Florida couple who dreamed of building the biggest house in America. The movie, which starts out like smirky reality television, turns into something darker and more complex as economic troubles take a toll on the Siegels and the audience becomes better acquainted with them. It's like a Theodore Dreiser novel for our new gilded age. (Scott)
'Rock of Ages' (PG-13, 2:03) A couple of unknowns and a flock of famous names (best in show: Tom Cruise) play 1980s rock hopefuls and burnouts on and off the Sunset Strip in this junky screen version of the Broadway jukebox musical. (Dargis)
- 'Savages' (R, 2:11) Oliver Stone's adaptation of Don Winslow's drug-war novel is violent, spacey, gorgeous and -- in the best Oliver Stone tradition -- a little nuts. Blake Lively, Aaron Johnson and Taylor Kitsch are a weed-dealing threesome who fall afoul of narco-traffickers led by Salma Hayek. Violence, comedy and sly social commentary swirl together and produce an impressively potent head rush. (Scott)
'Snow White & the Huntsman' (PG-13, 2:06) A dark, sometimes mesmerizing retelling of the Grimm fairy tale, with some interesting feminist undertones and a vividly diabolical performance by Charlize Theron as the wickedest stepmother of them all. Kristen Stewart is Snow White, the Huntsman is Chris Hemsworth (a k a Thor), and a who's who of digitally shrunken British actors play the dwarfs. (Scott)
'Take This Waltz' (R, 1:56) Sarah Polley's second feature (after ''Away From Her'') is a story of unruly desire that manages to be both feverish and analytical. Michelle Williams is Margot, who lives more or less happily in Toronto with her husband, Lou (Seth Rogen). But her attraction to a handsome neighbor (Luke Kirby) disrupts Margot's emotional equilibrium. Ms. Polley observes the resulting confusion with sympathy, intelligence and disarmingly frank sensuality. (Scott)
'Ted' (R, 1:46) Seth MacFarlane, creator of ''The Family Guy,'' takes his provocative humor and his New England-accented voiceover skills to the big screen in this profane, sometimes funny comedy about a talking stuffed animal, the overgrown boy who loves him (Mark Wahlberg), and, somewhat tangentially, the boy's girlfriend (Mila Kunis) who wishes he would just grow up. (Scott)
'That's My Boy' (R, 1:54) Fifth graders, rejoice! Here's a movie for you, with America's popular man-child (Adam Sandler) and a host of crude jokes about sex, beer, fat people, old people and every bodily fluid you can imagine. For adults, this mostly wretched movie is not without decent spots -- but they are very spotty indeed. (David DeWitt)
'To Rome With Love' (R, 1:52) Woody Allen's latest is a mild, silly collection of tales set in the Italian capital, where love is complicated and characters -- both Italian and American -- are baffled, neurotic and always articulate. Mr. Allen plays a semiretired opera promoter, while Jesse Eisenberg plays the younger Woody Allen type, torn between loyalty to his sensible girlfriend (Greta Gerwig) and her wayward, needy friend (Ellen Page). Alec Baldwin, Penelope Cruz and Roberto Benigni also contribute to this frothy, airy romp through some of Mr. Allen's favorite themes. (Scott)
'Trishna' (R, 1:48, in English and Hindi) Michael Winterbottom's redo of Thomas Hardy's ''Tess of the D'Urbervilles,'' set in contemporary India and starring a wan Freida Pinto, owes a bit to Bollywood and too much to the director's reductive reading of Hardy's novel. (Dargis)
'Tyler Perry's Madea's Witness Protection' (PG-13, 1:54) Tyler Perry keeps his Madea character on a leash in this latest addition to the franchise, which involves a Wall Street type (Eugene Levy) who hides out at Madea's house while waiting to testify about his company's Ponzi scheme. Madea has all sorts of chances to get crazy-funny -- dealing with a mouthy teenager, going through airport security, staying in a fancy New York hotel -- but never really lets it all hang out. (Neil Genzlinger)
'Union Square' (NR, 1:20) Mira Sorvino and Tammy Blanchard play estranged sisters from the Bronx, awkwardly reunited in a Manhattan apartment just before Thanksgiving. The director, Nancy Savoca, relishes the complexities of the sisterly relationship, but the movie is a little too small for her insights, or for Ms. Sorvino's full-throated, comic-medodramatic performance. (Scott)
- 'Wagner's Dream' (No rating, 1:55) Susan Froemke's impressively well-organized documentary about Robert Lepage's recent staging of Wagner's ''Ring'' cycle at the Metropolitan Opera argues that modern technology helped bring into being the kind of production that in the 19th century was thought to be impossible. (Holden)
'The Well Digger's Daughter' (No rating, 1:47, in French) Daniel Auteuil directs this once-upon-a-time French film about love, family and the beauty of the Provencal countryside, a remake of a 1940 movie by Marcel Pagnol. Mr. Auteuil plays an outwardly gruff patriarch; Astrid Berges-Frisbey plays the daughter who tests that love. (Dargis)
'Your Sister's Sister' (R, 1:30) Emily Blunt and Rosemarie DeWitt are the sisters, who converge accidentally at an island vacation house in the company of a lost, underachieving fellow played by the ubiquitous Mark Duplass. The film, directed by Lynn Shelton, is easygoing and engaging without being super-interesting, kind of like the characters, but the vibe is compromised by a hectic third act that forces it into farce and melodrama. (Scott)
Film Series
Animation Weekend (Friday through Sunday) The annual summertime celebration of animated shorts at BAMcinematek kicks off on Friday with a 75-minute program of highlights from the Ottawa International Animation Festival, screening at 6:50 and 9:15 p.m. The weekend continues with the locally organized Animation Block Party, which this year offers five programs comprising work from around the world, Brooklyn included. On Saturday, ''Eclectic Mix'' screens at 2 and 6:50 p.m. and ''International Shorts'' at 4:30 and 9:15 p.m.; Sunday brings ''Narrative Works'' (2 and 6:50 p.m.) and ''Fresh Visions'' (4:30 and 9:15 p.m.); and a program of ''Kid Animation'' screens on Saturday and Sunday at noon. On Saturday, from noon to 8 p.m., a free ''Art and Animation Trade Show,'' with vendors offering supplies and publications for animators, will be set up in the lobby. BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $12. (Dave Kehr)
The Paradine Case (Friday through Sunday) When MGM recently released a set of Alfred Hitchcock films produced by David O. Selznick on Blu-ray, the only title missing from the bunch was this problematic 1947 courtroom thriller, which stars Gregory Peck as a London barrister who finds himself falling in love with his client, an Italian woman with a shady past (Alida Valli) accused of murdering her wealthy husband. One senses the seeds of Hitchcock's late masterpiece ''Marnie'' in this study of the sexual allure of criminality, but in its present form (it was cut to 114 minutes from 132 after previews) the film doesn't coalesce, losing itself in multiple points of view that cloud the issues more than they deepen them. But for hard-core Hitchcockians, here is a rare chance to see the film in a 35-millimeter print. At 11 a.m., IFC Center, 323 Avenue of the Americas, at Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 924-7771, ifccenter.com; $13. (Kehr)
The Secret Cinema (Friday) The organizers of Philadelphia's long-running series devoted to odd and ephemeral films come to New York to offer two programs on Friday: ''Totally Wired: The Films of Bell Telephone,'' a collection of public promotional and in-house training films produced by AT&T, at 7:15 p.m., and the self-explanatory ''Creepy Puppet Films,'' featuring work by Ray Harryhausen, George Pal and Art Clokey, at 9:30 p.m. Anthology Film Archives, 32-34 Second Avenue, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 505-5181, anthologyfilmarchives.org; $9.

HEADLINE: Uganda Looks to New Chapter at Youth Series

BYLINE: By PAUL POST

 BODY:
Henry Odong learned two things from missionaries in Uganda -- baseball and Christianity.
That was about 20 years ago.
Next month, Odong will coach the first African team to play in the Little League World Series in South Williamsport, Pa. The team hopes to rewrite a story that ended in heartbreak last year when another Uganda squad was denied entry to the United States because of visa and birth certificate issues. This year's team has been cleared by the State Department to travel to the tournament, a statement on the Little League Web site said.
To Richard Stanley of Staten Island, who introduced Little League baseball to Uganda nine years ago, this latest chapter is akin to Lazarus's returning from the dead. He said winning the first game will be a major challenge for Uganda because its opponent on Aug. 17 is Panama, a nation where baseball is well established. 
''We're going to be the underdog,'' Stanley said. ''Everybody likes the underdog.''
Odong's team is from Lugazi, a town in central Uganda. Last year's team from Kampala -- Uganda's capital -- beat a strong Saudi Arabian team in the Middle East-Africa regionals, but the Saudi team wound up making the trip to Williamsport when problems arose with the Uganda team's birth records.
Odong has taken great pains to make sure his team does not meet a similar fate. His squad is composed strictly of 11-year-olds.
Upon arriving at this year's regional tournament, held in Kutno, Poland, Odong's team had no bats and only a handful of baseballs. However, by 6 a.m. the players were on the field each day, working on their skills.
''When we got there I would have said there's no way we're going to get past Poland,'' Stanley said. ''But their improvement is dramatic.''
Uganda lost its first regional game to its chief rival, Saudi Arabia, 2-1, on a last-inning two-run homer. Then it beat Dubai, Qatar, Kuwait and Kuwait again, 5-2, in the championship game.
Odong's team is sponsored by his employer, Mehta Group's Lugazi Sugar, which has already agreed to build a baseball diamond for his team to practice and play on after the Little League World Series.''It's the first corporate sponsor anywhere in Uganda,'' Stanley said.
In January, a team from Canada that Uganda was supposed to play in the 2011 Little League World Series traveled to Africa, where the squads met in an unofficial international competition. Uganda won, 2-1. Philadelphia Phillies shortstop Jimmy Rollins was part of a contingent that made the trip.
Now, with approved visas in hand, Odong's team is about to put Ugandan baseball on a much bigger stage. Stanley got Little League started as an outgrowth of his work with a United Nations economic development program.
He is part owner of the Trenton Thunder, a Yankees Class AA affiliate in the Eastern League.
Last September, after Uganda's setback, Stanley met with United States embassy officials in Kampala to find out what went wrong and how future problems could be avoided. He clearly remembered one thing.
''I told them, 'We're not going to go away,' '' Stanley said. ''We want to continue this program. We're going to come back.''

HEADLINE: A Christie Aide Is Named to Lead New Jersey's Development Agency

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN; Kate Zernike contributed reporting.

 BODY:
A former federal prosecutor who resigned her post in 2009 amid controversy over a loan of $46,000 from her former boss, Chris Christie, now the governor of New Jersey, has been named to lead the state's economic development agency.
The former prosecutor, Michele A. Brown, who is now a top aide to Mr. Christie, will become chief executive of the New Jersey Economic Development Authority in October. She will succeed Caren S. Franzini, who announced her resignation on Wednesday after 18 years in that job. 
Ms. Brown's appointment was recommended by the chairman of the authority's board, Alfred C. Koeppe, an appointee of Mr. Christie, and was approved unanimously by board members on Wednesday. She will make $225,000 in her new post -- a raise from the $140,000 she earns as the governor's aide.
Ms. Brown currently serves as appointments counsel for Mr. Christie, a job that includes recruiting judicial nominees and guiding them through the confirmation process. That has been a major headache for Mr. Christie, a Republican. Two of his State Supreme Court nominees this year were rejected by the Democrat-controlled State Senate. Opponents said that one had inadequate legal experience and that the other had a family with questionable business dealings.
It was not clear what background Ms. Brown has in economic development. She spent 18 years in the United States attorney's office and then worked as a white-collar criminal defense lawyer.
In a memo to other board members, Mr. Koeppe described Ms. Brown's position as being strategic in its focus. The board also created a new post of president and chief operating officer and appointed Timothy J. Lizura, a senior vice president of the economic development authority, to it. The organization is often described as one of the largest state-sponsored development banks in the country.
Ms. Franzini, who served under governors from both political parties, told The Star-Ledger of Newark that she wanted ''to do something else.''
But State Senator Raymond J. Lesniak, a Democrat from Union County, said he was worried that Ms. Franzini might have been forced out. ''It's the first time in the history of the Economic Development Authority,'' Mr. Lesniak said, ''that an obvious political appointee with no experience in economic development is going to be appointed to this agency -- at the expense of decades of great work done by Caren Franzini and others before her.''
Mr. Christie's spokesman, Michael Drewniak, said Mr. Christie twice asked Ms. Franzini to reconsider her plans after she had informed his office that she intended to resign. Mr. Drewniak also defended Ms. Brown's qualifications for the job.
''We've heard this refrain about this administration from the day we arrived,'' Mr. Drewniak said, ''that you're packed full of former prosecutors and other such professionals, and that our knowledge and experience would somehow be limited, and that we wouldn't be an effective government. I think it's safe to say that that's been proven to be false.''
The financial tie between Mr. Christie and Ms. Brown became public when Mr. Christie was running for governor in 2009, and it threatened to undermine Mr. Christie's campaign platform of uprooting corruption and improving ethics in a state known for political scandals.
Mr. Christie lent $46,000 to Ms. Brown in 2007, when he was United States attorney and she was one of his top aides. Ms. Brown's husband had lost his job, and Mr. Christie later explained that he and his wife had offered to help them financially.
After the loan became public, Mr. Christie apologized for not having reported it, as required, on his tax returns and financial-disclosure forms. Though he said the omission had been accidental he was assailed by Democrats, who suggested that Ms. Brown's financial ties to Mr. Christie raised questions about her ability to be impartial in her job.
Ms. Brown, then the No. 2 official in the United State's attorney's office, resigned days later, saying she did not want the matter to become a distraction to the office. Ms. Brown paid back the loan before Mr. Christie was elected governor in 2009, Mr. Drewniak said.

HEADLINE: For Exxon Mobil and Shell, Earnings Fall With Energy Prices

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS and STANLEY REED; Stanley Reed reported from London.

 BODY:
HOUSTON -- Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell, the biggest oil companies in North America and Europe, reported disappointing earnings on Thursday, attributing the results largely to lower global energy prices resulting from weakening economies.
The results came as no surprise to energy analysts, who noted that international benchmark prices for oil had declined by more than 7 percent in the second quarter, compared to the same period last year when turmoil in North Africa and the Middle East caused a spike in oil prices.
Natural gas prices in the United States have also plummeted by more than 50 percent over the last year. That has particularly hurt Exxon Mobil, which bought the gas driller XTO three years ago for $41 billion to expand its domestic gas production. The warm winter decreased demand for gas, and Exxon Mobil responded by slowing its exploration and production plans. 
Oil prices have been recovering in recent weeks because of rising tensions in the Persian Gulf region, leading some experts to predict better results in the current quarter.
This was the second quarter in a row in which Exxon Mobil fell short of Wall Street expectations. The company reported a jump in net income, but after some accounting adjustments related to asset sales in Japan and elsewhere, the company profits fell 22 percent from last year's second quarter, to $8.4 billion. Overall production of oil and gas declined by 5.6 percent.
Company spokesmen noted slumping economic activity, particularly in Europe, as a primary reason for declines in prices and sales. But they stressed that several long-term projects should assure the company's future, including an agreement with Rosneft to develop oil reserves in Western Siberia and a planned expansion of petrochemical production in the Gulf of Mexico region.
''Despite global economic uncertainty, we continue to invest throughout the business cycle, taking a long-term view of resource development,'' said Rex Tillerson, Exxon Mobil's chairman and chief executive.
There were some bright spots for the Texas-based company. Refinery profits increased by 14 percent, while net income for the chemical manufacturing business improved by 21 percent. Both units benefited from the lower gas and oil prices, the vital feedstocks for refining and chemical production.
But independent analysts viewed the results mostly with disappointment.
''Production growth remains fleeting for them,'' said Brian Youngberg, a senior energy analyst at Edward Jones. ''The XTO acquisition has not benefited them yet, but I think it can in the future.'' Mr. Youngberg predicted that Exxon Mobil's production volumes would improve by next year with the ramping up of new oil and gas production projects in Canada and off the coasts of Nigeria and Angola.
In contrast, Royal Dutch Shell, which is based in The Hague, reported higher production of oil and gas but said that profits for the quarter declined by 13 percent from the similar period in 2011, to $5.7 billion.
''Our profits have fallen with energy prices, but our growth strategy is delivering to the bottom line,'' said Shell's chief executive, Peter Voser, who pointed to low North American gas prices and weaker oil prices as reasons for the quarterly decline.
Stuart Joyner, an analyst at Investec in London, said that Shell's reported earnings were ''dreadful'' and well below what analysts expected. He said that the disappointing results were an indication that Shell was having difficulty controlling costs of materials and contractors. He said costs in the industry were going up 15 percent a year.
''They are facing a tsunami of costs, crucifying margins,'' he said.
Keeping expenses under control is critical for Shell because it is in the midst of one of the largest capital spending programs in the oil industry as it tries to ensure future oil and gas flows and revenue streams. The company is spending $32 billion this year on projects like the giant Pearl gas-to-liquids plant in Qatar, which converts huge volumes of natural gas to fuels like diesel. It is also making major investments in liquefied natural gas projects in Australia and hopes soon to begin exploration drilling for oil off Alaska after years spent securing permits.
Mr. Joyner noted that Shell's cash flow in the quarter of $9.5 billion, excluding movements in working capital, was less than the combined $10.9 billion in capital investment and dividend distributions that it reported.
The company said it had made $1.8 billion in asset sales during the period, which helped cover its capital costs.
Shell said that it produced 3.1 million barrels a day of oil equivalent in the quarter. That was a 2 percent increase over the similar period in 2011.
The company, which is one of the leading producers of natural gas, is looking for a way to participate in the giant new gas discoveries off East Africa. It recently dropped out of the bidding to acquire Cove Energy, a small British company that has a stake in a discovery off Mozambique.
Shell is also working on what could be major investments in North American gas. The company, in partnership with Korea Gas, Mitsubishi Oil and PetroChina, is examining the feasibility of building a liquefied natural gas export plant near Kitimat, British Columbia. Shell has a 40 percent share of the project. In addition, Shell is studying the possibility of building major gas operations in the United States, where it is already a major investor.
Shell is also well positioned in China, the other world-leading energy consumer along with the United States. On Wednesday the company announced an extension of its showcase China onshore gas joint venture, known as Changbei, with CNPC, China's largest oil company.

HEADLINE: In Mixed Economic Reports, Scant Hope for Improvement

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits fell last week to near a four-year low, but an unusual pattern for summer factory shutdowns kept hopes in check that the weak labor market was improving. 
Other data released on Thursday showed that new orders for long-lasting manufactured goods rose in June although a gauge of business spending plans declined, pointing to a slowdown in factory activity.
Economists said the two reports did little to change the view that the economy was stuck in a rough patch.
''They both look good on the surface, but I don't think there's really anything to get excited about,'' said Stephen Stanley, an economist at Pierpont Securities in Stamford, Conn.
A third report showed that contracts to buy used homes fell unexpectedly in June, a worrisome sign for the housing market.
Job creation slowed sharply during the second quarter as the economy was rattled by concerns about Europe's debt crisis and possible budget cuts in Washington at the end of the year.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 35,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 353,000, the Labor Department said, near a four-year low touched this month. That was a much sharper drop than economists had expected.
This year, however, automakers are carrying out fewer temporary plant shutdowns, throwing off the model the department uses to smooth the data for typical seasonal patterns. One measure that tries to smooth this volatility, the four-week moving average, fell 8,750 last week to 367,250.
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said durable good orders increased 1.6 percent in June, mostly because demand for aircraft surged.
Details of the report were generally weak, with declines in new orders for computers, electrical equipment and appliances and machinery.
Nonmilitary capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, fell 1.4 percent. This could be another sign that worries about Europe's difficulties and the prospect of a tighter fiscal policy in Washington were hampering economic growth.
The government is expected to report on Friday that the economy grew at a 1.5 percent annual rate in the second quarter, according to a Reuters survey of economists, slowing from the 1.9 percent rate in the previous three months.
Housing has been a relative bright spot in the American economy this year, but the National Association of Realtors said its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed in June, slipped 1.4 percent during the month.

HEADLINE: In Amazon's 2nd Quarter, The Usual

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- Leaping revenue, little profit.
That is the long-established Amazon story, and those who expected to hear it again Thursday were not disappointed.
The company reported sales of $12.8 billion, up 29 percent, in the second quarter while it eked out net income of $7 million, or a penny a share.
Those results essentially matched expectations. Analysts had estimated the Seattle-based retailer would earn 2 cents a share, down from 41 cents a share in the second quarter of 2011. 
In what is becoming a routine warning, Amazon said that profit in the current quarter would remain elusive. Revenue might grow as much as 31 percent, the company said, but it was expecting a loss. Losses at Amazon were routine in its early years but in recent years it has made a profit, albeit a small one.
This would be devastating news from some Internet companies. But Amazon bulls were unfazed, saying the retailer was investing, as always, in the future.
''If they keep this up, there's a good possibility that you're looking at shopping malls going the way of the record store and the bookstore and the video rental store,'' said Jason Moser, who covers Amazon for the Motley Fool investment site.
Amazon shares Thursday were up $3 to $220 during regular trading. The stock is trading only about 10 percent below its record high, with a stratospheric price-to-earnings ratio of about 170. In after-hours trading, shares continued rising.
Since its founding in 1994, Amazon has been focused on broadening its product and customer bases, not pumping up its profit margins. And the growth has been tremendous -- it is now one of the country's largest retailers. Even in North America, its most established market, it has been growing consistently more than twice as fast as the e-commerce market as a whole, a Forrester Research report released Thursday noted.
Amazon is building 18 new fulfillment centers around the world this year. In the United States, many of them are close to major cities, including New York City, San Francisco and Los Angeles. In a conference call with analysts, Thomas J. Szkutak, Amazon's chief financial officer, said, ''We're investing certainly for the long term.''
In the past, Amazon declined to build warehouses in states where it had many customers, because it would then have to collect sales taxes from them. Now the promise of offering these areas even faster delivery seems to be more of an imperative than continuing to fight the tax issue.
Amazon fans probably dream of ordering books or bagels and getting them the same day. But Mr. Szkutak indicated this would remain a dream. ''We don't really see a way to do same-day delivery on a broad scale economically,'' he cautioned.
Six of the new warehouses are already open. Getting some of the others ready for the all-important holiday season helps explain the predicted absence of profit in the third quarter. The centers are a large factor in Amazon's accelerating head count, which is up 60 percent over the last year to 60,000 employees.
One word that was little mentioned during the call by either Mr. Szkutak or the analysts: Kindle. Amazon's tablet, the Kindle Fire, was introduced last fall in an ocean of hype. New models are seen by some as overdue.
''We're excited about the road map we have'' for e-readers and e-books, Mr. Szkutak said. He declined to say what that map was.

HEADLINE: Starbucks Cuts Outlook, Citing Global Economic Slowdown

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Starbucks reduced its earnings forecast for the current quarter late Thursday and reported a profit that missed Wall Street expectations, citing economic weakness around the world. Its shares fell about 10 percent in after-hours trading. 
Traffic in the United States, its largest market, began slowing in June, Starbucks's chief executive, Howard D. Schultz, said in an interview. The company has been struggling in Europe for some time.
''We're dealing with significant global economic and consumer challenges,'' Mr. Schultz said.
The news came after disappointing results by the restaurant chains Chipotle Mexican Grill and McDonald's and reinforced concern about how much American consumers were reducing discretionary spending.
Starbucks said it now expected earnings for the current fiscal fourth quarter to be 44 to 45 cents a share, below the average analyst forecast of 48 cents a share. The company forecast fourth-quarter profit of 46 to 48 cents a share in April.
Starbucks's net income grew to $333.1 million, or 43 cents a share, for the fiscal third-quarter ended July 1, from $279.1 million, or 36 cents a share a year earlier. Analysts, on average, expected Starbucks to report a profit of 45 cents a share for the latest quarter, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters.
Total revenue grew to $3.30 billion from $2.92 billion. Sales at global restaurants open at least 13 months rose 6 percent, just shy of analysts' expectations, according to both Thomson Reuters and Consensus Metrix.
''Everyone saw a degree of a slowdown,'' said Matthew J. DiFrisco, an analyst at Lazard Capital Markets, adding that Starbucks's same-store sales were among the industry's strongest in the latest quarter.
Starbucks's forecast for earnings of $2.04 to $2.14 a share next year was significantly below analysts' average estimate of $2.28 a share, but Mr. DiFrisco said that leadership at Starbucks tended to be conservative.
''I take their guidance with a grain of salt,'' said Mr. DiFrisco, who puts Starbucks and Panera Bread at the top of his picks in the restaurant category.
Shares in Starbucks were down 10.4 percent to $46.91 in after-hours trading.

HEADLINE: Stocks Leap on Central Bank Remarks

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Wall Street stocks jumped on Thursday after remarks by Europe's central bank chief about protecting the euro zone from collapse helped reassure a market already expecting the Federal Reserve to step up stimulus efforts in the United States.
The Dow Jones industrial average leapt 250 points in early trading, about 2 percent, before trimming gains to about a 1.7 percent advance by the end of the session. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index also added 1.7 percent and the Nasdaq composite index rose 1.4 percent. 
The European Central Bank president, Mario Draghi, pledged to do whatever was necessary to protect the euro zone from collapse, including fighting unreasonably high government borrowing costs. The comments caused an immediate spike in global stock and commodity markets.
Policy makers have made similar statements about saving the euro before, but if these latest remarks result in decisive intervention in European bond markets, investors hope it could spur a sizable rally in stocks.
Shares in sectors more sensitive to risks in Europe and slowness in the economy, such as materials and financials, looked set to lead the market. Morgan Stanley shares rose 2.6 percent.
''The overarching concern over the last week or so has been that the euro zone is slowly melting into the Mediterranean,'' said Art Hogan, managing director of Lazard Capital Markets in New York. ''To have Draghi come out and say, listen, we are keeping this together,'' he said, will add support.
''Remember, though, that the E.C.B. can't do this alone,'' Mr. Hogan said. ''He's going to have to have support from Germany and we'll see if that's forthcoming.''
Hopes that the Federal Reserve will bolster efforts to stimulate a flagging economy, maybe with a decision to do so as early as at its rate-setting meeting next week, soothed concerns about the economy and offset the impact of what investors describe as a ''mixed'' corporate earnings season.
In a reassuring sign on the economy, the number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits fell last week to near a four-year low, the government said, a hopeful indication for a labor market that has shown signs of weakness.
Shares in Sprint Nextel jumped 20 percent after the company posted earnings. Net operating revenue rose to $8.8 billion from $8.3 billion. Analysts expected $8.727 billion, according to Thomson Reuters.
With around two-fifths of S.&P. 500 companies reporting earnings as of Wednesday, 65 percent have beaten Wall Street's profit estimates. However, three in five companies missed revenue estimates, with many pointing to a weakening global economy.
Earlier, European markets made even bigger advances than New York, with the Spanish Ibex 35 index soaring 6.1 percent. The Italian FTSE MIB index jumped 5.6 percent and the CAC 40 in France gained 4.1 percent.
Troubled sovereign bonds also made a recovery, with the yield on the 10-year Spanish note narrowing to 6.828 percent and the Italian to 6.009 percent.
''Finally, the markets have forced the E.C.B. and the euro group leaders to begin to make statements that the market really wants to hear,'' said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital in New York.
''Yes, he's said before that the euro is irreversible, but today he says it's irreversible and we will make it irreversible,'' said Mr. Cardillo.

HEADLINE: With Farm Bill Delayed, House Works on Short-Term Aid Measure

BYLINE: By RON NIXON

 BODY:
After delaying action on a sweeping farm bill, House leaders are now working to shape interim legislation that would aid farmers hit hard by a drought that has devastated large swaths of cropland and threatens livestock operations in the Midwest, lawmakers said on Thursday. 
Even as the idea of new legislation emerged, it remained unclear if lawmakers would use the opportunity to renew existing agriculture programs in the absence of a broader farm bill or would simply pass a disaster aid bill that would provide relief to cattle, pork and poultry farmers, who have been especially hard hit by the drought. Several disaster assistance programs for livestock producers that were in the 2008 farm bill expired last year.
''I do believe the House will address the livestock disaster program that unfortunately in the last farm bill was only authorized for four years,'' Speaker John A. Boehner said on Thursday.
This week, the Agriculture Department said that 55 percent of the nation's pasture and range land was now in poor to very poor condition. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack designated 76 additional counties in six states as drought disaster areas, bringing the total for the 2012 crop year to 1,369 counties across 31 states.
Members of the Senate, which passed its version of the farm bill in May, have been waiting on the House to vote on the bill, and they say they are opposed to extending the current farm bill. Senators said an extension would delay the changes they approved in cutting farm subsidies and food stamps and improving crop insurance. Both the House and the Senate farm bills eliminate the $5 billion-a-year subsidies paid to cotton, grain and soybean growers whether they plant crops or not.
House leaders have delayed the farm bill in hopes of averting a fight between Republicans over a proposal for steep cuts in food stamps and over the potential cost of the bill, which totals $996 billion over the next 10 years. The House bill would cut $16.5 billion from the food stamp program. The Senate bill would cut $4.5 billion.
''If the House intends to send us a bill that will be used to negotiate the farm bill during August, I am open to that approach,'' Senator Debbie Stabenow, the Michigan Democrat who leads the Agriculture Committee, said in a statement. ''However, a short-term extension is bad for farmers and our agricultural economy.''
''If Congress does what Congress always does and kicks the can down the road with a short-term extension, there will be no reform, direct payments will continue, we'll lose the opportunity for major deficit reduction and we'll deliver a real blow to our economic recovery,'' Ms. Stabenow said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Paring Down Marketing Messages to a Few Simple Basics

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
SIMPLY put, a lot of what Madison Avenue says these days is simply put.
''Simply,'' ''simple'' and ''simplicity'' -- along with like-minded thoughts that include ''easy,'' ''honest'' and ''clear'' -- have become marketing buzzwords in response to three related trends: how busy life today seems, the growing complexity of technology and the increasingly complicated economic picture. That has encouraged advertisers to woo consumers with promises to provide solutions that are meant as simple but not simplistic.
''We all have this desire to simplify our lives, but we don't know how to do it,'' said Marian Salzman, the longtime trend tracker and chief executive of Euro RSCG Worldwide Public Relations, North America, who described herself during an interview as ''talking on one BlackBerry'' with her second BlackBerry ''in my hand, with my coffee.'' 
Envy is also driving the simplicity movement, Ms. Salzman said, listing examples: ''We have envy of other people who seem to have it together. We envy the time we had just three TV channels to choose from. And we envy the man in the gray flannel suit who knew when work started and ended.''
Simplicity marketing is, well, simple to find. Radio commercials for McDonald's offer paeans to ''the simple joy of a wholesome breakfast.'' Ads call Ban antiperspirant ''effortlessly simple,'' while those for Ally Bank declare, ''Saving is simple when no one charges you for it.''
Ads for Glaceau Smartwater assert, ''Simplicity is delicious.'' Ads for Ivory soap urge, ''Keep it pure, clean and simple.'' And a commercial by Goodby, Silverstein & Partners for the California Milk Processor Board, which seeks to contrast milk with alternatives like soy milk, ends with these words: ''Real. Simple. Got milk?''
''Most food today is processed,'' said Steve James, executive director at the milk board, but milk is ''a good, natural, simple, honest choice.''
''The category has become so confusing and complicated, we thought it was a good time to remind people about what's always been their go-to beverage,'' he added.
In some categories, simplicity draws a crowd. Ads for Whirlpool appliances carry the headline, ''To simplify life, we design around it,'' while ads for Amana appliances read, ''Life. Simplified.''
There are brands named Simple, a line of skin-care products from Unilever; Simple Mornings, muffin mixes from Duncan Hines; Simple Pleasures, chocolates from Hershey; and Simple Spa, wax warmer kits from Sally Hansen.
Also in stores are Simply Gingerbread, a flavor of Stacy's pita chips; Simply Dressed salad dressings from Marzetti; and 13 chilled beverages from Coca-Cola bearing names beginning with Simply, all billed as ''Honestly simple.''
The Simply brand is intended as ''an easy option for consumers when their lives are so busy and complicated,'' said Allison Higbie, group director of marketing for the Simply juices and drinks sold by the Coca-Cola Company. The first variety, Simply Orange, was introduced regionally in 2001 and became available nationally in 2003.
''We recognized what consumers wanted early on,'' Ms. Higbie said, and the subsequent expansion of the line is ''confirmation we're right on.''
Another early arrival to the simplicity party was Time Inc., which introduced Real Simple in 2000 as a magazine published 10 times a year with a rate base -- the circulation guaranteed to advertisers -- of 400,000. Real Simple -- which now has a rate base of 1.975 million, according to the publisher, Sally Preston, -- is published monthly and is accompanied by tablets, apps, a Web site and scores of licensed products sold by stores like Bed Bath & Beyond and Target.
''Simplicity is the new luxury,'' said Kristin van Ogtrop, managing editor. ''In a world where everyone's busy and there's a lot of uncertainty, you can't put a price on that.''
''Our audience is largely women,'' she added, ''and if you look at the number of women in the work force, the number of roles women are juggling, their lives are getting only more complicated.''
In several instances, simplicity marketing is implicit rather than explicit. For example, in new commercials for Applebee's restaurants by Crispin Porter & Bogusky, an announcer admonishes actors playing Applebee's chefs to keep it simple rather than wax rhapsodic about ingredients.
''They just want to know if it tastes good,'' the announcer, the comedian Jason Sudeikis, chides a chef in one spot. ''It's not a science show.''
The goal is to ''tell it how it is,'' said Rob Reilly, partner and worldwide chief creative officer at Crispin Porter. ''People want honest talk, and our idea is: 'Let's just simplify the message. Applebee's makes great food you can eat every day. It's not complicated.' ''
Likewise, ads by Mullen for JetBlue Airways carry the theme ''You above all'' and make pledges like ''Same air. Better travel,'' rather than saying outright, ''We make flying simple.''
The intent is ''transparency, clear, concise messaging,'' said Lisa Borromeo, director for advertising and brand at JetBlue, derived from a philosophy that ''what you hear from us is what you get from us.''
Dave Weist, executive creative director at Mullen, offered another reason JetBlue is not Simple Airways.
''Air travel is complex and there are things that are out of your control,'' he said. ''We'd rather show how we're different, how we're going to make it simple for you.''
How long can ads with simplicity themes continue, given how trends in advertising come and go?
''We can't even imagine how complicated and busy consumers' lives are going to become,'' Ms. Higbie of Coca-Cola said. ''It's definitely a consumer insight with staying power.''
Ms. Salzman, the trend tracker, agreed. ''It's become fundamental to who we are as consuming Americans,'' she said. ''As soon as you have enough money to have stuff, you wish you had less stuff.''

HEADLINE: Stocks Soar After Pledge To Support Euro Zone

BYLINE: By JACK EWING; Niki Kitsantonis and Nathaniel Popper contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The head of the European Central Bank said on Thursday that policy makers would do ''whatever it takes'' to save the euro zone, buoying global financial markets.
But analysts were quick to caution that the euphoria could once again prove short-lived in Europe's long-running debt crisis, which has escalated in recent weeks on fears that Greece could soon be forced out of the common currency zone and that Spain and Italy might follow.
The comment by Mario Draghi, the bank's president, raised hopes that the central bank was becoming more willing to throw its weight around in bond markets, buying huge quantities of debt to keep borrowing costs for Spain and Italy from rising so high that they threaten the common currency.
''Within our mandate, the E.C.B. is ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro. And believe me, it will be enough,'' Mr. Draghi said, setting expectations for bold moves at the central bank's meeting next week. 
The interest rates on Italian and Spanish bonds dropped sharply. Major stock markets in the United States rose more than 1.4 percent and in Europe jumped more than 4 percent.
Also on Thursday, a European official said that Greece could count on the continued support of the European Union as long as it met neglected commitments to its international creditors under its latest bailout.
In the three years that the euro zone crisis has festered, there have been numerous occasions when European officials unveiled policy responses and market optimism soon evaporated. Earlier this year, Mr. Draghi himself said that the worst of the crisis seemed to be over, after the central bank flooded banks with low-cost loans. But the mood soon turned sour again.
Mr. Draghi did not specify the actions that policy makers might take, but the Spanish government and the International Monetary Fund have all but begged the European Central Bank to resume buying bonds as a way to clamp down on the turmoil plaguing financial markets.
Traders have increasingly pinned their hopes on intervention by the bank and the Federal Reserve as the economic outlook in both the United States and Europe has weakened. Past asset-buying programs by central banks, like the European Central Bank's decision to buy Spanish and Italian bonds last fall, have helped stop precipitous market declines. But the bank has not bought bonds in the troubled countries for months.
Economists cautioned that Mr. Draghi was probably still reluctant to effectively begin financing European governments because of the uproar it would cause in Germany, where public opinion is firmly against bailing out countries seen as irresponsible.
''I have no doubt that the E.C.B. will save the euro area from collapse,'' said Charles Wyplosz, a professor of economics at the Graduate Institute in Geneva. ''The problem is that they are operating in a difficult political environment with general German hostility. They can only move at the tipping point or close to the tipping point.''
Besides spiking bond rates, doubts are building about Greece's ability to meet its bailout conditions, with Willem Buiter, a Citigroup economist, saying there is a 90 percent probability that Greece will leave the euro zone in the next 12 to 18 months.
In Athens, Jose Manuel Barroso, the president of the European Commission, insisted that Greece would not be isolated if it pushed through stalled economic reforms demanded by its foreign creditors -- the commission, E.C.B. and International Monetary Fund. ''The key word is deliver, deliver, deliver,'' Mr. Barroso said after talks with Prime Minister Antonis Samaras.
He called for greater solidarity across the bloc. ''All in the euro zone must come together to support our currency. Some have not realized that we are in the same boat,'' Mr. Barroso said, adding: ''My message to Greeks is that they are not alone. We will stand by them.''
Strategists are worried that each new instance of intervention seems to provide less relief than the last. This is because central banks have not been successful in addressing the underlying problems in Europe's weaker economies, which are growing worse with each passing month.
In recent days Spain's long-term borrowing costs had risen to nearly 7.7 percent, a level that would eventually make it impossible for the country to finance itself and would set off a chain of events that could destroy the common currency, with grave consequences for the global economy. The yield, or interest rate that bond buyers demand, plunged to 6.8 percent for Spanish 10-year bonds on Thursday, and dropped to 6 percent for Italy. That may have been his intent.
Ken Wattret, an analyst at the French bank BNP Paribas, said in a note that Mr. Draghi's comments might be ''merely a threat to act, designed to put some two-way risk back into markets.''
But traders will eventually try to test the central bank's resolve. So strong words by Mr. Draghi will probably be effective over the long term only if the bank officially declares that it will not tolerate market interest rates on European government debt above specified levels, and is willing to spend as much as needed to cap them.
The Swiss National Bank has used similar declarations to keep its currency from appreciating too much. But such a promise would require a willingness by the E.C.B. to effectively print money, a strategy that would outrage many Germans.
''The more credible the commitment, the less likely the market will test it,'' Jacques Cailloux, an economist at Nomura, said in a note Thursday. But he added, ''This is easier said than done.''
Vocal dissent from someone like Jens Weidmann, the president of the Bundesbank and an influential member of the European Central Bank governing council, might convey the impression that policy makers are divided and undercut their credibility. Mr. Weidmann has said many times that he believes large purchases of government bonds would violate a ban on using the bank to finance governments.
In response, Mr. Draghi said Thursday that the European Central Bank would stay within its mandate, which requires the bank to defend price stability above all else. But he added that if government borrowing costs interfered with the central bank's ability to influence interest rates, its main tool for controlling inflation, ''they come within our mandate.''
Mr. Draghi has noted in recent weeks that the bank's mandate also requires it to fight deflation, a ruinous decline in prices, as well as inflation. That is seen as also opening the door to huge bond purchases.
The bank has intervened sporadically in government bond markets since 2010 but has not bought any government bonds since March and only relatively modest amounts since Mr. Draghi took office in November.
Speculation that the European Central Bank would resume its purchases intensified after it cut its benchmark interest rate earlier this month to a record low of 0.75 percent. The cut does not appear to have lowered borrowing costs for business and consumers in countries like Italy and Spain that need it most. As a result, analysts say, the bank will need to reach for other monetary policy tools to restore the flow of credit, and ultimately to preserve the common currency.
The bank's governing council holds its monthly monetary policy meeting next Thursday.
Mujtaba Rahman, an analyst at the Eurasia Group who covers Europe, said that Mr. Draghi would probably agree to large bond purchases only if several conditions were met. These would include guarantees from euro zone members that they would cover any losses and measures to ensure that Spain and Italy continue efforts to make their economies function more efficiently.
Mr. Rahman agreed that Mr. Draghi would ultimately do what it took to save the euro, partly because its failure would mean the end of the European Central Bank as an organization. ''If the euro disintegrates, they are all out of work,'' Mr. Rahman said in an e-mail. ''So, there is a preservation instinct at play here also.''
In the markets, taking more risk was at play on Thursday for the first time in days. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 211.88 points, or 1.67 percent, to 12,887.93. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 22.13 points, or 1.65 percent, to 1,360.02. The Nasdaq composite index rose 39.01 points, or 1.37 percent, to 2,893.25.
In Europe, the Spanish Ibex 35 index soared 6.1 percent and the Italian FTSE MIB index jumped 5.6 percent. The CAC 40 in France gained 4.1 percent.
In the bond market, the price of the Treasury's 10-year note fell 12/32, to 102 27/32, while its yield rose to 1.44 percent, from 1.40 percent late Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Volkswagen Reports An 18% Gain In Profit

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
FRANKFURT (AP) -- Stronger demand from North America and the world's developing markets helped Volkswagen record an 18 percent jump in second-quarter earnings on Thursday. 
Net profit for the April-June period increased to 5.64 billion euros ($6.83 billion) from 4.78 billion euros in the period a year earlier. Revenue increased 19 percent, to 48.1 billion euros.
Volkswagen said Thursday that demand for cars increased in the second quarter in the United States, China, India and Russia, and would rise again in the second half of the year, but at a slower pace.
The company warned that the car market would shrink further in Western Europe, where economies are slowing because of spending cutbacks and consumer worries about the debt crisis. Nonetheless, it reaffirmed its forecast for this year's earnings.
European sales fell 1.5 percent in a market that shrank 6.8 percent.
''The situation has placed the whole of the motor industry under considerable pressure,'' Christian Klingler, the company's sales and marketing chief, said in a conference call with analysts.
Volkswagen has outperformed other European mass-market carmakers, which are struggling with weak pricing and markets depressed by slow growth and high unemployment in countries like Italy and Spain. It enjoys a strong business in China and reaps higher margins from its Audi luxury brand.
The net profit figure easily beat analysts' estimates, compiled by FactSet, of 2.79 billion euros. Operating earnings, however, increased by just 3.4 percent, to 3.28 billion euros, and fell short of expectations for 3.29 billion euros.
The company said it would meet its goal of operating earnings this year equal to last year's 11.3 billion euros. The company ran ahead of pace in the first half, at 6.5 billion euros, but said it expected earnings to be held back by model changeovers in the third quarter, which is typically a weaker one for car companies.

HEADLINE: Strip Clubs in Tampa Are Ready to Cash In On G.O.P. Convention

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ

 BODY:
TAMPA, Fla. -- Over at the back door of the 2001 Odyssey, a limo-size tent with flaps -- especially designed for discretion and camera-shy guests -- is ready to go up. Deja Vu is welcoming extra ''talent'' from around the country in its V.I.P. rooms.
And Thee DollHouse is all Americana: women plan to slip out of red, white and blue corsets and offer red, white and blue vodka. The headliner that week is expected to bear an uncanny resemblance to a certain ex-governor from a wilderness state, known for her strong jaw and devotion to guns and God. 
''She's a dead ringer for her,'' said Warren Colazzo, co-owner of Thee DollHouse. ''It's just a really good gimmick to get publicity.''
As Tampa gears up for the Republican National Convention, the biggest party it has ever held, the city and its businesses are primping and polishing for the August arrival of tens of thousands of visitors. Like it or not -- mostly not, for city officials -- Tampa's well-known strip clubs have joined the welcome wagon.
Club owners here say they have schmoozed with their counterparts in former host cities, like Denver, and have been told that revenue pours in during conventions, sometimes quadrupling earnings from a Super Bowl week. As for party affiliation, this is one place where the country's caustic partisan differences fall away, owners say.
Angelina Spencer, the executive director of the Association of Club Executives, which serves as a trade association for strip clubs, said an informal survey of convention business in New York and Denver had determined that Republicans dropped more money at clubs, by far.
''Hands down, it was Republicans,'' she said. ''The average was $150 for Republicans and $50 for Democrats.''
As further evidence of the clubs' nonpartisan appeal, Don Kleinhans, the owner of the 2001 Odyssey, said when the Promise Keepers, a male evangelical group, came to town years ago, business was rollicking.
''We had phenomenal numbers all weekend, and they walked in wearing badges and name tags and weren't shy at all,'' he said.
James Davis, a spokesman for the Republican National Convention, declined to discuss Tampa's prominent strip clubs.
''We're expecting to have a great convention,'' Mr. Davis said. ''We're focused completely on having a great convention.''
To be fair, Tampa is known for other things: cigars, Ybor City -- the historic district where Cuban and Spanish cigar makers first settled in the late 1800s -- three major sports franchises, four Super Bowls and beautiful beaches a short drive away. It is the Florida Gulf Coast's economic engine and hosts a raucous pirate party every year called Gasparilla.
But Tampa cannot shed its national reputation as the strip club capital of the country. ''It's not true,'' said Joe Redner, the owner of the renowned Mons Venus and a man famous for fending off local attempts to close his club. ''It would be nice, though.''
The Tampa Bay Times has reported there are 20 strip clubs in Tampa and 30 in the Tampa Bay area. Tampa does not have as many strip clubs as New Orleans, Atlanta, Houston, New York and Las Vegas, owners said. Miami boasts quite a few, too.
Mr. Redner, who has repeatedly brandished the First Amendment, has been arrested 150 or so times and has run often for public office, may be one reason for the city's reputation. Savvy and colorful, he took on the city in 2000 when it tried to cripple his club; instead, it bolstered his reputation. A Tampa councilman back then, Bob Buckhorn, who is now Tampa's mayor, backed an ordinance to ban lap dances by keeping customers six feet away from dancers. The rule, intended to curb prostitution and drugs, passed but is mostly not enforced.
During that fight, Mr. Buckhorn recalls saying that he ''did not want Tampa to become the lap dance capital of the country.'' But the statement got truncated and twisted, like in a game of telephone, then repeated, most recently during the debate over gambling in Florida.
''We wanted Tampa to be a place where we were proud to call home,'' said Mr. Buckhorn, a Democrat. ''But we have grown so much bigger and moved beyond that small city we were. We don't think about it anymore.''
Yet he is not without a sense of humor. ''I wonder whether the look-alike will be able to see Russia from the stage,'' he asked, a question meant for the ex-governor's doppelganger.
The spaceship, a much-talked about private V.I.P. room perched atop the 2001 Odyssey like a wedding-cake embellishment, has also helped burnish Tampa's louche label. It is white, oval, with round windows, a rare prefabricated Futuro house designed by the Finnish architect Matti Suuronen in the 1960s and 1970s.
''It was named one of the seven wonders of Tampa Bay,'' said the Odyssey's manager, Todd Trause. The provenance of that distinction is hard to decipher.
Inside, Jazmin, 19, prepared to live-chat on a webcam to a faraway customer, one of the club's new features. She is also preparing for the convention. Given the opportunity to stand up before a politician, she will do her job, naturally, but also share her own tale of financial struggle, as many voters here would do.
Laid off from a job in the Medicaid billing industry, she scraped by as a cashier at a grocery store. The paycheck scarcely covered her car payments, she said. Then a friend of a friend told her about the strip club, and now there she is, saving her money (the most she's ever made) for nursing school.
''With the economy,'' she said, ''it's hard.''

HEADLINE: The Big Banker's Change of Heart

 BODY:
Sometimes, in a great national debate, the most powerful voices can be those of the converted. Think of Nixon to China or, more recently, President Obama's declaration of support for same-sex marriage. Now add to the list Sanford Weill, the financier who led the charge for the repeal of the 1933 law that separated commercial banks from investment banks. He says banks have grown too large, that they may need to be broken up a bit and that separation should be restored.
In the late 1990s, Mr. Weill used the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act to help usher in an era of huge firms -- epitomized by his own Citigroup -- that brought trading, mergers and acquisitions, commercial lending and other banking services under one roof. Banks became bigger and bigger and their banking and trading arms more intertwined. It was the beginning of a period of sharp deregulation of the financial industry in general. 
Some expressed alarm about having banks, driven by huge profits and huge bonuses, bet the money of their depositors on new, opaque and increasingly risky investment instruments. But the idea that the industry did better without regulation was entrenched in the political debate, not only on the right, but across the political aisle and into the higher reaches of the Clinton administration. It was not until the 2008 financial crisis that Americans woke up to the dire threat posed by banks so big that their failure could destroy the financial system and even the economy.
Appearing Wednesday morning on CNBC, Mr. Weill surprised everyone, including his interviewers, by announcing that the wall should be rebuilt between a bank's deposit-taking operations and its risky trading businesses. ''What we should probably do is go and split up investment banking from banking,'' he said. ''Have banks do something that's not going to risk the taxpayer dollars, that's not going to be too big to fail.''
It's tempting to say that Mr. Weill sure took his sweet time coming to this realization. And we should note that his position is driven primarily by his belief that rebuilding that wall would make banks more profitable. He also says that he does not regret the Glass-Steagall repeal, which he thinks was the right thing to do at the time.
But the important thing is that the architect of the megabank has stepped forward and called for sensible financial regulation -- much in the same way that Warren Buffett shook things up by calling for tax increases on the most wealthy Americans. Other bankers from the 1990s boom have also expressed concern about deregulation, including John Reed, who helped create Citigroup with Mr. Weill.
Mr. Weill's position carries special weight. Representative Carolyn Maloney, a Democrat of New York, said at a hearing on Wednesday that Mr. Weill appeared to be calling for even stronger regulation than envisioned in new rules aimed at curbing the risky behavior of banks.
While we are on this subject, add The New York Times editorial page to the list of the converted. We forcefully advocated the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act. ''Few economic historians now find the logic behind Glass-Steagall persuasive,'' one editorial said in 1988. Another, in 1990, said that the notion that ''banks and stocks were a dangerous mixture'' ''makes little sense now.''
That year, we also said that the Glass-Steagall Act was one of two laws that ''stifle commercial banks.'' The other was the McFadden-Douglas Act, which prevented banks from opening branches across the nation.
Having seen the results of this sweeping deregulation, we now think we were wrong to have supported it.

HEADLINE: Ex-Barclays Official in Line for $13.6 Million Payout

BYLINE: By MARK SCOTT; Ben Protess contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
LONDON - A former senior Barclays executive involved in the interest rate manipulation scandal is set to receive a $13.6 million payout, a compensation package that could add to the scrutiny of the British bank.
Jerry del Missier, the bank's former chief operating officer who resigned this month, has been a central figure in the firestorm.
In June, British and American authorities fined Barclays for reporting false rates to increase profits and make the bank look healthier during the financial crisis. According to regulatory documents, a senior executive - later identified as Mr. del Missier - asked bank employees to lower the firm's submissions of the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. 
The Barclays case is the first major action stemming from a multiyear inquiry into rate-rigging that has ensnared more than 10 banks. Since the Barclays settlement, lawmakers have taken aim at regulators and bank executives.
In Congressional testimony on Thursday, Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, vowed that authorities would forcefully pursue criminal investigations. Mr. Geithner, who ran the Federal Reserve Bank of New York during the financial crisis, has taken heat for not halting the illegal actions back then, despite evidence of problems. Instead, he advocated broad reforms to the rate-setting process.
''I believe that we did the necessary and appropriate thing,'' he said on Thursday before a Senate panel, the second Congressional hearing this week to focus on Mr. Geithner.
Mr. del Missier, who has held a number of top positions at the bank, has also defended his actions to lawmakers. In testimony to the British Parliament this month, the Canadian-born executive said he believed he was following the instructions of senior government officials. ''I expected that the Bank of England's views would be incorporated into our Libor submissions,'' he said. ''The views would have resulted in lower submissions.''
Regulators say Mr. del Missier misinterpreted a discussion between Robert E. Diamond Jr., the former chief executive of Barclays, and Paul Tucker, the deputy governor of the Bank of England, the country's central bank.
Pay issues have dogged Barclays for months.
This year shareholders balked at the size of management's pay packages. In April, the top executives pledged to give up some of their bonuses if the bank did meet certain performance goals.
Shortly after the Barclays settlement, Mr. Diamond and Mr. del Missier agreed to forgo their annual payouts. Days later, both of them resigned over their roles in the rate-manipulation scandal. To help quell public anger, Mr. Diamond agreed to forfeit deferred stock bonuses of up to $31 million.
The former chief could still collect one year of salary and a cash payment collectively worth $3.1 million. Mr. del Missier is set to receive $13.6 million, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. The news of Mr. del Missier's payout was reported earlier by Sky News.
Barclays is now looking to replace many of its senior officials. Along with Mr. Diamond and Mr. del Missier, its chairman, Marcus Agius, has said he will leave once a new chief executive is in place. On Wednesday, Alison Carnwath, chairwoman of the firm's compensation committee, also gave up her position, citing undisclosed personal reasons.
A spokesman for Barclays declined to comment. A representative for Mr. del Missier was not immediately available for comment.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: A Visitor's Questions on Readiness for Games Prompt a Curt Response

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER; Helene Cooper contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
LONDON - Mitt Romney's trip to London was supposed to be about the Olympics. And it was - but not quite in the way he had expected.
Mr. Romney's choreographed visit here caused a diplomatic stir after his comments on the British Olympics preparations and whether Londoners would turn out to support the Games prompted a rebuke from Prime MinisterDavid Cameron and grabbed the attention of the news media.
''There are a few things that were disconcerting, the stories about the private security firm not having enough people, the supposed strike of the immigration and customs officials, that obviously is not something which is encouraging,'' Mr. Romney said in an interview with NBC on Wednesday. 
That brought a tart rejoinder from Mr. Cameron: ''We are holding an Olympic Games in one of the busiest, most active, bustling cities anywhere in the world. Of course it's easier if you hold an Olympic Games in the middle of nowhere.'' The allusion was to Salt Lake City, which hosted the Games that Mr. Romney oversaw in 2002.
Mr. Romney's comments came on the first day of a highly anticipated trip that was expected to test his skills in foreign diplomacy, terrain on which he is not necessarily as comfortable as when dealing with economic issues. His remarks quickly threatened to take over the news from the overseas trip, which will also include a visit to Jerusalem to meet with Israeli leaders on Sunday and a stop in Poland.
Later, in brief remarks before his meeting with the Labour Party leader, Ed Miliband, Mr. Romney seemed to tone down his comments.
''My experience with regards to the Olympics is it is impossible for absolutely no mistakes to occur,'' he said. ''Of course there will be errors from time to time, but those are all overshadowed by the extraordinary demonstrations of courage, character and determination by the athletes. The Games are, after all, about the athletes, the volunteers and the people of the community that come together to celebrate those athletes.''
But the British press had already pounced. News of Mr. Romney's remarks led The Times of London's Web site at one point under the headline ''PM rebuffs Romney over readiness for Olympics,'' and The Guardian's Web site offered up a story titled ''Romney's Olympics blunder stuns No. 10 and hands gift to Obama.''
MayorBoris Johnson even used the candidate's words to rally thousands of Londoners at the end of the 69-day Olympic torch relay in Hyde Park, saying, ''There's a guy called Mitt Romney who wants to know whether we're ready.''
Such overseas trips can be diplomatic minefields for politicians, but they also can offer opportunities, as when PresidentJohn F. Kennedy won over French news media, telling reporters in France that he was ''the man who accompaniedJacqueline Kennedy to Paris.'' For Mr. Romney, this is a chance to burnish his foreign policy credentials, a goal that now looks a bit more difficult to achieve.
At the White House, officials were privately chortling over Mr. Romney's remarks.Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, said senior officials had met Thursday morning to discuss security at the Olympics, then added that during a meeting with staffers,President Obama ''made it clear that he has the utmost confidence in our close friend and ally, the United Kingdom, as they finalize preparation to host the London Olympics.''
Mr. Carney never mentioned Mr. Romney, but the timing of the Olympics announcement raised eyebrows, prompting one reporter to ask Mr. Carney if it had anything to do with Mr. Romney's remarks. The press secretary replied: ''I'm just trying to fill you in on the president's day.''
Mr. Cameron praised his nation's performance in hosting the games, which get under way this week.
''This is a time of some economic difficulty for the U.K., but look at what we are capable of achieving as a nation even at a difficult economic time,'' he said. ''I think we will show the whole world not just that we come together as a United Kingdom, but also we're extremely good at welcoming people from across the world.''
Mr. Cameron added: ''I will obviously make those points to Mitt Romney. I look forward to meeting him.''
After his meeting with the prime minister, Mr. Romney emerged from 10 Downing Street and further refined his remarks.
''My experience as an Olympic organizer is that there are always a few very small things that end up going not quite right in the first day or so,'' he said. ''Those get ironed out and then when the Games themselves begin and the athletes take over, all the mistakes that the organizing committee - and I made a few - all of those are overwhelmed by the many things that the athletes carry out that capture the spirit of the games.''
He also mentioned that he had met with the head of the MI6 foreign intelligence agency to discuss Syria and ''the hope for a more peaceful future for that country'' - another comment the British press seized on as a gaffe because, they wrote, visiting dignitaries typically do not discuss their private meetings with the MI6 chief.
In his original remarks on Wednesday, Mr. Romney also seemed to question the enthusiasm of the British public for the Games, which will include a horse owned by his wife,Ann, competing in the dressage competition.
''Do they come together and celebrate the Olympic moment?'' he asked about the British people. ''That's something which we only find out once the Games actually begin.''
The remarks came as Mr. Romney's campaign had hoped to use the stop in London to remind voters back home about his success in overseeing the Salt Lake City Olympics in 2002.
In addition to making an aide available to provide details of Mr. Romney's meetings, which included talk of the euro zone crisis and other international concerns, the campaign sent out short general memos, one of which described Mr. Romney's get-together on Thursday with Foreign Secretary William Hague, saying it dealt with issues like the importance of free trade.
''Also worth noting,'' the e-mail read, ''they both discussed their mutual love of Kit Kat bars.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Money For Nothing

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
For years, allegedly serious people have been issuing dire warnings about the consequences of large budget deficits -- deficits that are overwhelmingly the result of our ongoing economic crisis. In May 2009, Niall Ferguson of Harvard declared that the ''tidal wave of debt issuance'' would cause U.S. interest rates to soar. In March 2011, Erskine Bowles, the co-chairman of President Obama's ill-fated deficit commission, warned that unless action was taken on the deficit soon, ''the markets will devastate us,'' probably within two years. And so on.
Well, I guess Mr. Bowles has a few months left. But a funny thing happened on the way to the predicted fiscal crisis: instead of soaring, U.S. borrowing costs have fallen to their lowest level in the nation's history. And it's not just America. At this point, every advanced country that borrows in its own currency is able to borrow very cheaply. 
The failure of deficits to produce the predicted rise in interest rates is telling us something important about the nature of our economic troubles (and the wisdom, or lack thereof, of the self-appointed guardians of our fiscal virtue). Before I get there, however, let's talk about those low, low borrowing costs -- so low that, in some cases, investors are actually paying governments to hold their money.
For the most part, this is happening with ''inflation-protected securities'' -- bonds whose future repayments are linked to consumer prices so that investors need not fear that their investment will be eroded by inflation. Even with this protection, investors used to demand substantial additional payment. Before the crisis, U.S. 10-year inflation-protected bonds generally paid around 2 percent. Recently, however, the rate on those bonds has been minus-0.6 percent. Investors are willing to pay more to buy these bonds than the amount, adjusted for inflation, that the government will eventually pay in interest and principal.
So investors are, in a sense, offering governments free money for the next 10 years; in fact, they're willing to pay governments a modest fee for keeping their wealth safe.
Now, those with a vested interest in the fiscal crisis story have made various attempts to explain away the failure of that crisis to materialize. One favorite is the claim that the Federal Reserve is keeping interest rates artificially low by buying government bonds. But that theory was put to the test last summer when the Fed temporarily suspended bond purchases. Many people -- including Bill Gross of the giant bond fund Pimco -- predicted a rate spike. Nothing happened.
Oh, and pay no attention to the warnings that any day now we'll turn into Greece, Greece I tell you. Countries like Greece, and for that matter Spain, are suffering from their ill-advised decision to give up their own currencies for the euro, which has left them vulnerable in a way that America just isn't.
So what is going on? The main answer is that this is what happens when you have a ''deleveraging shock,'' in which everyone is trying to pay down debt at the same time. Household borrowing has plunged; businesses are sitting on cash because there's no reason to expand capacity when the sales aren't there; and the result is that investors are all dressed up with nowhere to go, or rather no place to put their money. So they're buying government debt, even at very low returns, for lack of alternatives. Moreover, by making money available so cheaply, they are in effect begging governments to issue more debt.
And governments should be granting their wish, not obsessing over short-term deficits.
Obligatory caveat: yes, we have a long-run budget problem, and we should be taking steps to address that problem, mainly by reining in health care costs. But it's simply crazy to be laying off schoolteachers and canceling infrastructure projects at a time when investors are offering zero- or negative-interest financing.
You don't even have to make a Keynesian argument about jobs to see that. All you have to do is note that when money is cheap, that's a good time to invest. And both education and infrastructure are investments in America's future; we'll eventually pay a large and completely gratuitous price for the way they're being savaged.
That said, you should be a Keynesian, too. The experience of the past few years -- above all, the spectacular failure of austerity policies in Europe -- has been a dramatic demonstration of Keynes's basic point: slashing spending in a depressed economy depresses that economy further.
So it's time to stop paying attention to the alleged wise men who hijacked our policy discussion and made the deficit the center of conversation. They've been wrong about everything -- and these days even the financial markets are telling us that we should be focused on jobs and growth.

HEADLINE: Scandals May Cost The Banks Their Clout

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris writes on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
After the financial crisis, nothing was more surprising than the speed with which the banks regained their self-confidence and their influence, not to mention their haughtiness.
''They feel more powerful to me than they did before the crisis, when they were healthy,'' one regulator told me recently.
That sense of power may have peaked this spring, before JPMorgan Chase disclosed its $2 billion -- now $5.8 billion and counting -- ''hedging'' loss and before the public firestorm erupted, largely in Britain, over the Libor scandal.
In trying to understand how it is that an industry whose excesses nearly brought down the world economy could recover so quickly, it may be helpful to remember the answer attributed -- probably erroneously -- to Willie Sutton, the Depression-era criminal, when asked why he robbed banks: ''That's where the money is.'' 
The banks, for all their sins, remain the principal source of capital for people and companies, particularly small ones. Getting them to lend more -- without resorting to the excesses that caused the crisis -- is a reasonable goal for public policy. That means that any regulation that bankers oppose may be vulnerable to arguments that it will hurt the economy.
And then there are campaign contributions. People who make millions of dollars a year can make big ones.
Now there is a question as to whether that power is in danger of being broken as a result of public revulsion over the JPMorgan hedging fiasco and the Libor scandal. The banks had turned this year's debate into one over regulations they do not like, and seemed likely to at least win a few concessions. Suddenly the issue is whether big banks should be broken up. Sandy Weill, who put together Citigroup, now says he thinks it and its competitors should be torn apart. Bank lobbyists may have to play defense, not offense, in coming months.
To understand how the world may have changed, it is worth looking at how perceptions have changed regarding both the JPMorgan loss and the Libor scandal since they were originally disclosed. At first the JPMorgan loss appeared to be a $2 billion embarrassment, but no worse. There was no rogue trading. There appeared to have been poor management oversight, but it was not clear that the trading violated any rules. The purpose was to hedge against losses that would be caused by a new credit crisis, the bank said.
The Washington attitude that this did not amount to much could be seen when Jamie Dimon, the JPMorgan chief executive, testified before a Senate hearing. Some of the senators fell all over themselves to be respectful.
''You guys know the industry better than anybody sitting up here,'' said one. Another said Mr. Dimon was ''obviously renowned, rightfully'' as being ''one of the best C.E.O.'s in the country for financial institutions.''
But things have changed since then. Months after the loss was first disclosed, JPMorgan still has not been able to unwind the positions completely. That sounds like the kind of gambling by an institution that benefits from deposit insurance that Paul Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, was trying to prevent when he proposed the Volcker rule to bar ''proprietary trading'' by banks.
The final rules to put the Volcker rule into effect have been delayed by bank lobbying, but it appears that the JPMorgan trades would have been legal under the preliminary rules. It will be interesting to see if regulators now strengthen the rules.
In restating its first-quarter profits, JPMorgan said that the securities might have been valued improperly by traders. The prices were within the range of market prices at the time, JPMorgan said, but they now appear to have been too optimistic as an assessment of what JPMorgan could hope to get if it sold the positions.
It may get worse for JPMorgan. This week Bloomberg News analyzed unusual trading patterns in some of the derivative securities that JPMorgan is believed to have owned, and asked whether that reflected trading by the bank aimed at market manipulation.
''Spikes in late January and again at the end of February, which more than doubled the volume of trades in an index tied to the creditworthiness of companies, lowered the cost of the index, raising the value of the bank's holdings,'' Bloomberg News reported. ''The surges came just before end-of-the-month bank audits to verify prices.'' The bank declined to comment on the Bloomberg report.
The JPMorgan loss now plays into the bad image of banks. If the good image is of kindly bankers lending money to businesses that will grow and prosper, allocating capital in a way that will benefit all of us, the bad image is of a group of traders who will rig markets when they can and lie about them to customers if possible.
We have seen plenty of examples of that in recent years. When the auction-rate securities market began to disintegrate, some banks moved their selling efforts into high gear, so as to get the securities off their books and into the hands of gullible customers. The first enforcement action by the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau concluded that Capital One had taken advantage of poor customers by persuading them to buy add-on credit card products that they could not use.
The invisible hand of the market has many benefits, but it sometimes needs to be restrained. ''People of the same trade seldom meet together,'' wrote Adam Smith, the patron saint of free markets, ''even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices.''
Market manipulation is at the heart of the Libor -- London interbank offered rate -- scandal. The idea that such a thing could happen seems not to have occurred to bank regulators for years, a reality that speaks volumes about their mind-set.
Libor rates are supposed to be the rates at which banks can borrow from one another without putting up collateral. We've more or less known for years that the banks posted fake rates during the financial crisis, when there was no interbank lending market to speak of, but that was taken as evidence of how bad the crisis was, not as an indication of improper behavior.
Thanks, however, to dogged investigation by a United States regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the settlement with Barclays revealed that the rate rigging was going on long before the financial crisis began. The bank's officials were not just trying to make their bank look better. They were trying to rig markets in their favor.
Moreover, most of the time they were not doing that to benefit the bank, by which I mean the institution that takes deposits and makes loans, as opposed to the part of the company that tries to make money trading securities. Barclays, like every other bank, makes many loans indexed to Libor. So if Libor rates were manipulated higher, the bank would collect more interest income and make more money. That would be illegal, but at least it would be helping the part of the bank that performs the socially desirable activity of lending.
Instead, they were often rigging the Libor rates to be lower. That would hurt the bank, but at many institutions the bank is not the important part. The big paychecks go to the traders who manage to make big profits. And those traders had complicated derivatives positions that could benefit if Libor rates fell by even a little. Perhaps the big banks should be broken up, if only to assure that bankers run the banking parts.
It is clear that even some of the regulators who imposed sanctions on Barclays did not understand how badly the bank had behaved. The two top executives of Barclays who were involved in approving the submission of fraudulent numbers were Robert Diamond, the chief executive, and Jerry del Missier, his top lieutenant. Before the settlement was disclosed, British regulators saw no need for Mr. Diamond to leave, and approved a promotion for Mr. del Missier.
The firestorm soon made it clear that both Mr. Diamond and Mr. del Missier would have to go, and they were hauled before a parliamentary committee to explain themselves. Those questioners were less polite than the American senators had been to Mr. Dimon, but there was one telling fact. Mr. Diamond called each member of the parliamentary committee by his or her first name. It was clear confirmation of how cozy the relationships had been in the past.
It is a strange fact that effective regulation can empower banks. American banks are now far better capitalized than most European institutions because the American regulators forced them to raise capital. Before the current crisis of confidence, that had encouraged banks to step up campaigns to blunt the new rules. European banks, which were not forced to raise capital, face the specter of more regulation, with some of it coming from euro zone institutions that may be less easy to manipulate than were national regulators.
We will soon see evidence of whether bank power has dipped. It will be seen as various Dodd-Frank regulations are completed. Will they be weakened, as the banks had hoped? It will be seen at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, historically the most supine of the bank regulators. Will the new comptroller, Thomas J. Curry, be able to change its culture? It will be seen at the Bank of England, whose regulatory powers are about to grow. Will officials who looked the other way when the Libor violations were occurring be forced out? And it will be seen in Congress, as Republicans decide whether to continue their anti-regulation campaign and Democrats weigh whether they should climb on Mr. Weill's ''Break Up the Banks'' bandwagon.

HEADLINE: Quiet Duo Forged Road Deal for U.S. and Pakistan

BYLINE: By DECLAN WALSH; Eric Schmitt contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- Much like the 900-mile highway that links the heaving port of Karachi with the storied Khyber Pass on the Afghan border, the United States' relationship with Pakistan this year has been winding and strewed with unexpected hazards.
After months of painful negotiations that reached a formal conclusion this week, that road has reopened to NATO supply traffic and the broader diplomatic relationship has wobbled back on track -- at least for now. 
On Wednesday, the Pakistani cabinet approved a 10-page document that sets the terms for NATO transit traffic, codifying a political deal that was struck in early July and that broke a seven-month deadlock that had stranded more than 11,000 military shipping containers bound for Afghanistan.
The Pakistanis received an American apology for the deaths of 24 Pakistani soldiers in American airstrikes in November -- and other, more tangible benefits. The United States will transfer $1.1 billion in delayed military aid in the coming days, giving an urgent lift to an ailing economy. The Americans have also promised to refurbish 130 miles of Pakistani road.
The breakthrough, American and Pakistani officials say now, was not won through the high diplomacy efforts that dominated headlines through that stretch, but rather through an unconventional back channel run by a low-key duo: Thomas R. Nides, a deputy to Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, and Abdul Hafeez Shaikh, Pakistan's finance minister.
Both cut their teeth in finance: Mr. Nides came to the Obama administration from Morgan Stanley, while Mr. Shaikh is a soft-spoken Boston University graduate who previously worked in the World Bank and equity finance.
''The bean counters did it,'' said a senior American official, in comments intended to convey admiration rather than disparagement. The official spoke on condition of anonymity, as did several others interviewed about the talks.
The channel between Mr. Nides and Mr. Shaikh was established in late May amid secrecy after months of mishaps and missed opportunities on the part of more seasoned players. Much of it revolved around the vexed notion of an American apology.
At first Pakistan's foreign minister, Hina Rabbani Khar, asked the Americans to stall their apology until Parliament met. But by the time she met Mrs. Clinton in London in February, anti-American riots had seized Afghanistan after an episode in which American troops burned copies of the Koran. Mr. Obama's expression of regret for that caused his aides to caution against a similar gesture to Pakistan, amid fears that the president's rivals could label him as ''apologizer-in-chief.''
A major NATO conference in Chicago in May stirred hopes of a breakthrough. But on the first day of the meeting, an article in The Chicago Tribune by the Pakistani ambassador to Washington, Sherry Rehman, listed five Pakistani demands, annoying Mr. Obama, said senior officials on both sides. ''It really set us back,'' one American said.
A day later, Mrs. Clinton and President Asif Ali Zardari agreed to the channel between Mr. Nides and Mr. Shaikh. ''Make it happen'' she told Mr. Nides. Secrecy was paramount: only a tiny group of insiders on both sides was privy to the talks.
Through e-mails, conference calls and discreet meetings, at least four drafts of the American apology went back and forth. The two men played on their personal chemistry and shared business background, often eschewing the traditional posturing of diplomacy. They also had to contend with significant resistance in their own camps.
Pakistan's army chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, rejected early American offers of an apology for deaths ''on both sides.'' Mr. Nides pushed to bring around skeptics in the White House, where anti-Pakistan sentiment was hardening.
The president and his advisers were swayed, however, by money and geopolitics. The alternate supply route, through Central Asia, was costing the American military an extra $100 million per month, or about $17,000 per truck. That route was also, to some degree, hostage to the dissipating good will of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.
Positions shifted. At a barbecue at Pakistan's Washington embassy residence in late June, the national security adviser, Thomas E. Donilon, signaled to Ms. Rehman that the White House was ready to move. Mr. Shaikh invited Mr. Nides and an American team to Islamabad. On July 1, the two sides gathered in Ms. Khar's Islamabad home for a fateful five-hour meeting.
It got off to a rocky start. General Kayani opened the meeting with a new draft apology that the Americans had not seen; Mr. Nides exploded with anger in protest, according to several people present, and officials from both sides took a break, venturing into the garden for fresh air.
On resuming, both sides calmed down and reworked the text, line by line. Two days later, in a carefully orchestrated maneuver, Mrs. Clinton phoned Ms. Khar and said ''sorry'' for the deaths of the 24 soldiers.
Days later, the first trucks rumbled out of a Karachi port, headed for Afghanistan.
Under the agreement finalized this week, the United States will continue to pay standard trucking fees of about $250 per truck -- less than the $5,000 demanded by Pakistan at one point. Crucially, it also eases the immense task of transporting military materiel out of Afghanistan that will be needed as the 2014 withdrawal deadline nears.
Still, officials say it should take at least two months to clear the backlog of 11,000 containers in Karachi, some of which have been stuck there since November. ''We're not looking forward to opening the cheese container,'' one diplomat joked.
Despite all the talking, several Pakistani demands remain unresolved: for a halt to drone strikes, which seems unlikely, and a resumption of military aid, which has better chances of success.
Some officials, even while expressing relief that relations had at last reached a corner, if not quite turned it, warned that the crisis highlighted the dangerous frailty of relations between the two countries. One senior Pakistani official said, ''This relationship can't be subjected to so many wounds in such a short space of time.''

HEADLINE: Romney Fund-Raisers in London Draw Banking Crowd

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER and LANDON THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
LONDON -- After a day made long by his remarks about London's readiness for the Olympic Games, Mitt Romney found a friendlier audience here on Thursday night at fund-raisers heavily populated with American financiers, donors representing an industry that has had troubles of its own.
Mr. Romney held a fund-raising reception and a more exclusive dinner here on Thursday that included some of the top American financiers working in London. The firms they represent run the gamut from private equity funds, hedge funds and big investment banks like Goldman Sachs and J. P. Morgan -- all of which have substantial business hubs in London's financial district. 
In his remarks at the high-cost event at the Mandarin Oriental in Hyde Park, Mr. Romney steered clear of the Libor scandal over interest rates, opening his comments by describing the relationship between the United States and Britain (''special'') and praising the sights of London (''inspiring'').
But at the end, Mr. Romney fielded several questions from the audience. The first asked Mr. Romney where he stood on reforming the banking system.
''There's no question but that regulations are essential to the functioning of markets,'' he said, repeating a view he has mentioned on the campaign trail. ''Of course, you have to have laws and regulations to make free markets able to produce and to be effective. But you have to make the regulations modern and up-to-date.''
Mr. Romney then launched into an attack on the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory law, calling it ''unnecessary'' and ''overly burdensome.''
''With regard to regulation here in the U.K., I've got nothing to say about what goes on here, but back in the U.S., I want us to stay highly competitive, the financial capital of the world,'' he concluded. ''At the same time, I want to make sure that we protect the citizens in the nation and have rules that people can rely upon.''
Among those writing the biggest checks will be the chairmen of the dinner event, where the price of entry was $25,000 to $75,000 per head: Louis Bacon, a hedge fund billionaire and founder of Moore Capital Management, who splits time between New York and London; Karl Peterson, who heads European operations for the Texas Pacific Group, a private equity firm; and Dwight Poler, a managing director in Europe for Bain Capital, Mr. Romney's former private equity firm.
Co-chairmen included Steven Chasan, another executive from Moore Capital Management, and Eric Varvel, the chief executive of Credit Suisse's investment bank.
Mr. Romney picked a precarious time to visit London's financial community. British, European and American banks here are under close scrutiny from regulators on both sides of the ocean for their attempts to manipulate key interest rates.
So far Barclays, Britain's third largest bank, has been at the scandal's forefront, and the bank's former chief executive, Robert E. Diamond Jr., withdrew his name from Thursday's event after he was forced to resign from the bank. Patrick Durkin, a senior lobbyist for Barclays in Washington who has raised more than $1 million for Mr. Romney, remained a co-chairman.
The rate-rigging scandal has set off a vocal anti-banker backlash here, with everyone from the governor of the central bank to David Cameron, Britain's conservative prime minister, weighing in on how badly bankers have behaved. Eleven members of Parliament even recently signed a resolution that named Mr. Romney and called for Barclays executives to ''cease fund-raising for political candidates.''
Accusations that HSBC, Europe's largest bank, which is also headquartered in London, engaged in money laundering practices and the fact that most of J. P. Morgan's derivatives trading losses originated here have not helped the city's financial reputation either.
But the malaise is broader than that. The euro zone debt crisis and a lingering recession in Britain have sharply curbed core banking operations like lending, trading and deal-making, and many companies with large investment-banking operations here, like Deutsche Bank, are contemplating deeper job cuts as profits sag.
Nevertheless, even though this year should see a significant bonus reduction for most in the banking world, Mr. Romney's visit has prompted many to reach for their checkbooks. Indeed, while many bankers here accept that banker conduct must improve, they worry that the push for more regulation and higher taxes -- not to mention the public attacks on their profession, both here and in the United States -- has gone too far.
In Mr. Romney, given his ties to the industry and his tax-cutting promises, they have found a person they can back with enthusiasm.
And for all of the news about the Libor scandal, an attendee at the reception said that the controversy was merely ''background noise'' for those in the ornate ballroom -- replete with crystal chandeliers and gold paneling and filigree.
According to the campaign, roughly 250 people attended the event, which was expected to bring in at least $2 million.
And, in a nod to Britain, Mr. Romney's guests dined on fish and chips, passed around in paper cones.
''It was the most expensive halibut in town,'' said one person who attended the more exclusive dinner, adding that Mr. Romney upheld the challenger's tradition of not criticizing the president while on foreign ground and had a positive view of getting America back to work.

HEADLINE: 'Big Government' Isn't So Big by Historical Standards. It's Also Shrinking.

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Government has been shrinking steadily for two years now, and compared to the size of the overall economy, government is actually slightly smaller than it has been on average since World War II. 

 BODY:
While Washington debates whether big government is holding back the economy, it's worth keeping a couple of facts in mind: Government has been shrinking steadily for two years, and compared to the size of the overall economy, government is actually slightly smaller today than it has been on average in the postwar era.
Here's a chart showing the annualized percentage change in gross domestic product (blue) and the percentage change in total government spending and investment (red):
The overall economy has been growing for 12 quarters. Total government spending (federal, state and local), on the other hand, has been falling for eight quarters. That decline has been driven primarily by state and local spending, which has been falling for 11 quarters. Federal spending has fallen for six of the last seven quarters.
In other words, without the drag of shrinking government, the growth rate of the overall economy (which is measured as consumer spending + investment + government spending + net exports) would be faster. That is even before you consider how public layoffs ripple through the private sector as unemployed workers curb their spending.
Indeed, the shrinking government labor force is another factor worth noting when thinking about the role of government in the economy. While President Obama has been pegged as a big-government politician, the total number of government jobs has actually under his presidency. Federal payrolls have risen a little bit, but not enough to fully plug the steady leak of layoffs at the state and local level.
Finally, to help you further put the size of government in perspective, consider that government spending relative to the size of the overall economy is actually slightly below its long-term, postwar average.
In the second quarter of this year, government spending (technically called "government consumption expenditures and gross investment") represented 19.5 percent of the overall economy. Since 1947, the earliest date available, government spending has averaged about 20.2 percent of the economy.
For context, note that during Reagan's administration, government spending represented 20.7 percent of the country's gross domestic product, just above the country's longer-term average.
It is perhaps no wonder, then, that much of President Obama's liberal base is unhappy that the federal government has not done more to stimulate growth, even as his conservative critics decry socialism.

HEADLINE: A High-Rise Lab Amid Madagascar's Troubled Treetops

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: A new four-story research center abutting a lemur-rich forest offers a unique learning platform for scientists studying an endangered ecosystem. 

 BODY:
Patricia Wright, a Stony Brook University scientist who is a longtime student of lemurs and voice for conservation in Madagascar, has sent a Dot Earth postcard (you can, too) reflecting on the opening there this month of a remarkable new research hub for studying the array of species in one of the island nation's parks. 
Madagascar's biological patrimony is in deep trouble. Earlier this month, Wright described the "lemur holocaust" that has been under way since a 2009 coup. 
For more on her remarkable personal story, watch the video interview after her post to learn how, three decades ago, an owl monkey in a Manhattan pet store diverted Wright into primatology and anthropology from a planned career as an elementary school teacher.
Here's Wright's dispatch (I've added contextual links and offer a big thank you to the anthropologist and master communicator Mireya Mayor for logistical help):
Everyone is talking about accounting for the economic value of ecosystems and the risks of disease transmission from wildlife to humans in this fast-changing world. But few people are talking about facilitating the basic scientific research that's required. Research is difficult in tropical, poor countries where many of these ecosystem services and infectious diseases occur.
But there are signs of change. Earlier this month in Madagascar, one of the top 10 biodiversity "hotspots" in the world, a new kind of research building was inaugurated. NamanaBe Hall (Friendship Hall) is the technology and outreach wing of the Centre ValBio Research Station, founded by Stony Brook (NY, U.S.A.), Helsinki (Finland), Antananarivo (Madagascar) and Fianarantsoa (Madagascar) Universities.
The Centre ValBio center employs 85 local people and hosts 100 researchers a year from all over the world. It is nestled into the rain forest overlooking a cascading river. There are 13 species of lemurs inside the adjacent Ranomafana National Park, five of which are critically endangered, according to new IUCN Red List classification. Ranomafana National Park became a Unesco World Heritage Site in 2007, one of the seven Malagasy eastern rain forest sites with this honor.
On July 2, six hundred people had gathered to celebrate this new building. That morning, I stood on the fourth-story balcony overlooking the rainforest, the mist coming in waves, and looked for my lemurs, content that all 13 species were leaping, resting, feeding, safe.
With this inauguration, Centre ValBio offers the world a window on a remarkable ecosystem and also high-peed Internet, top lab equipment for genetics, genomics, hormones and infectious disease. NamanaBe Hall will also have dormitories for students and professors. Despite the building's height, this is not an "ivory tower" place. This is a research center with a heart. Strong health, education and economic development programs built on 26 years of relationships and collaborations link the center with the surrounding community. Local people are now learning how to use computers and iPads and databases that can be helpful for them - for instance chemical analyses of medicinal plants. Local people are learning trades such as iron working, textile making and tourism skills that mean jobs in the near future.
Conservation has a strong foundation in Madagascar, which offered the world the first nationwide Environmental Action Plan in 1991. But two decades later, Centre ValBio is taking steps to link this approach to studying and saving the rain forest and its inhabitants with the wider world through global connectivity and technology.
Here's the interview in which Wright describes the roots of her unusual career:

HEADLINE: City Rolls Out a Rocky Welcome Mat for Mussels

BYLINE: DAVID W. DUNLAP


HIGHLIGHT: An artificial mussel bed is part of an "eco-park" in the East River Waterfront Esplanade that will open to the public next year. 

 BODY:
Now don't start chopping shallots, but we thought you'd be interested to know that an artificial mussel bed - believed to be the first of its kind along the city shoreline - is under construction on the East River. 
The habitat, two submerged V-shaped concrete troughs studded with about 340 rocks, is part of a new "eco-park" in the East River Waterfront Esplanade. The $165 million esplanade project, by the New York City Economic Development Corporation, extends about a mile and a half from Pier 35 down to the Battery Maritime Building. The corporation would not break out the cost of the mussel bed, whose home will be at Pier 35, near Rutgers Slip.
The park will open to the public next year. It already open to any mussel daring enough to thread its way through a construction zone and hitch its beard to a chunk of granite atop a steel dowel embedded in concrete.
On July 1, workers for the Hunter Roberts Construction Group began installing 30 big concrete blocks, weighing 11 to 59 tons each, that compose the mussel bed. The job will continue through August. The blocks were fabricated in Schuylerville, N.Y.; then taken by barge to Newark, where the rocks were attached; then barged again to Pier 35. They are made especially heavy to keep them weighted down in place.
David Kane, the executive vice president for capital programs at the Economic Development Corporation, said creating the marine habitat allowed officials to piggyback an educational and environmental feature on infrastructural work that had to be done in any case: the reconstruction of a deteriorated storm sewer outfall pipe at the foot of Pier 35. The mussel bed is being installed on top of the outfall.
At best, the 65-foot-long habitat will attract colonies of blue mussels and ribbed mussels. An environmental consulting firm, Great Ecology, determined that a mussel bed would be feasible in this location, city officials said.
East River water quality has improved considerably since the 1970s. One critical yardstick, the level of fecal coliform bacteria in 100 milliliters of water (about 6.7 tablespoons) has dropped to 118 from 160,000. But city officials do not anticipate that the mussels will be fit for human consumption, especially since the bed sits so close to a sewer outfall.
Though unusual in its scope, the mussel bed is not unique among efforts to provide such habitats in New York waterways. For example, artificial reefs known as reef balls have been installed at Hunts Point Landing in the Bronx.
Even if the bed at Pier 35 fails to attract mussels, officials envision it as an unusual abstract sculpture that can be used to study the extent and effect of tides. A little bridge will cross over the mouth of the habitat, which occupies a small cove. At high tide, the structure will be almost entirely under water. At low tide, it will be almost completely exposed. Maritime grasses will border it at one edge.
Neither state nor federal regulatory agencies required such a habitat, Mr. Kane said, adding, "This was about doing something new."
The "eco-park" and walkway on Pier 35 will be screened from the adjoining Sanitation Department shed on Pier 36 by an inclined vine-covered wall. The lead project manager for the Economic Development Corporation is Terri Bahr. The designers of the esplanade are SHoP Architects and Ken Smith Landscape Architect; engineering is by a joint venture between HDR and Arup. Ocean and Coastal Consultants served as structural marine engineer for the mussel bed.
All this expertise and it will still be up to the mussels themselves to decide whether it was worth the effort. How will we know if they start moving in?
Get ready for Mussel Cam 2013. (But please put the shallots away.)

HEADLINE: Barclays' Profit Falls as New Regulatory Problems Emerge

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: The problems continue to mount at Barclays, as the British bank disclosed that it was facing lawsuits related to the rate-rigging scandal and that regulators were investigating the company's financial director on a different matter. 

 BODY:
LONDON - The problems continue to mount for Barclays, as the British bank disclosed that it was facing lawsuits related to a rate-rigging scandal and that regulators were investigating the company's financial director on a different matter.
The bank's legal and regulatory burdens have been a continued source of financial pain for Barclays.
On Friday, Barclays reported that net profit dropped 76 percent to $752 million during the first six months of the year after taking an accounting charge on its debt and a charge for inappropriately selling complex financial products to small businesses. Last month, Barclays and other banks settled with British regulators over those sales, of interest rate swaps.
On Friday, Barclays said that the Financial Services Authority, the British regulator, was looking into the actions of some current and former employees, including the finance director, Chris Lucas, over the disclosure of fees related to the bank's capital-raising efforts in 2008. The issues revolve around agreements with the Qatar Investment Authority and the Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation of Japan, according to regulatory filings.
After the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, the British bank tapped Middle Eastern investors for a combined 11.8 billion, or $18.6 billion, in two rounds of capital raising. Existing shareholders have voiced concerns that their rights were overlooked when Barclays turned to outside investors for a fresh injection of capital.
"Barclays considers that it satisfied its disclosure obligations and confirms that it will cooperate fully with the F.S.A.'s investigation," the bank said in a statement.
Last month, Barclays announced a $450 million settlement with American and British authorities over the manipulation of benchmark rates, including the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. On Friday, Barclays disclosed that it was facing class-action lawsuits in the United States related to such issues. One of the lawsuits also cites unnamed current and former members of the bank's board as defendants, according to a statement from the bank.
Barclays said it was "not practical" to estimate the costs related to the legal proceedings. Morgan Stanley analysts have said global banks may have to pay more than a combined $20 billion in penalties and fines related to the manipulation of Libor.
"We are sorry for the issues that have emerged over recent weeks and recognize that we have disappointed our customers and shareholders," Barclays' chairman, Marcus Agius, who will step down, said in a statement.
As it deals with the fallout, Barclays must also remake its management team. As the rate manipulation scandal unfolded, Robert E. Diamond Jr., the company's former chief executive, and Jerry del Missier, the former chief operating officer, both resigned. Mr. Agius said in a conference call that the firm would appoint a new chairman before selecting its next chief executive.
The bank is also taking a close look at its actions. Barclays has appointed Anthony Salz, vice chairman of the advisory firm Rothschild, to conduct a review into the British bank's business practices. Some current and former Barclays employees may still face criminal charges related to the rate-rigging scandal.
Despite the bad news, investors found a reason to be upbeat. By the close of trading in London, the bank's shares had jumped nearly 9 percent.
Without the accounting charge and other one-time costs, Barclays' net profit in the first half of the year rose 9 percent, to 3.07 billion, compared with 2.8 billion a year earlier. The earnings, which beat analysts' estimates, were driven by an improved performance in the bank's retail and corporate banking divisions.
Barclays' investment banking unit, however, continued to get hit by the European debt crisis. Other global rivals, like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, have faced weakness in their investment banking activity, but analysts said that Barclays had done better than most to maintain its trading income.
The bank reported a 1 billion pretax profit in its investment banking unit in the three months through June 30, a 2.5 percent increase over the previous year. Barclays does not report net income for its separate business units.
"Despite the more recent regulatory assault, this underpins the belief that, in challenging conditions, Barclays Capital should continue to consolidate market share," Ian Gordon, a banking analyst at Investec in London, said in a note to investors.
The British bank said it had reduced its exposure to the debt of Southern European countries by 22 percent, to 5.6 billion, during the first six months of the year. The bank's core Tier 1 ratio, a measure of ability to weather financial shocks, fell slightly to 10.9 percent.
"We continue to be cautious about the environment in which we operate and will maintain the group's strong capital, leverage and liquidity positions," Mr. Lucas of Barclays said in a statement.

Jennifer Steinhauer takes a look at Mr. McCain's efforts to get active again, preaching his party's agenda to reporters and voters, after his disappointing presidential defeat in 2008.

        
Mitt Romney added damage control to his London itinerary after suggesting that the city might not be ready for the Olympics and questioning whether residents would turn out for the Games, Ashley Parker reports. But he was unable to head off a rebuke from Prime Minister David Cameron or to avoid making headlines in the British press.

        
Mr. Romney found support among financiers at high-cost fund-raising events in London Thursday, earning their enthusiasm with his connections to the industry and promises of tax cuts - though his visit with the financial community amid a rate-rigging scandal has risky timing, Ashley Parker and Landon Thomas Jr. report.

A Deeper Look at Facebook's Earnings Report | So. Facebook has reported its first earnings report as a public company. And investors apparently didn't like what they saw.
Even though the company essentially met analyst estimates for revenue and adjusted earnings per share, the social network's shares tumbled more than 10 percent in after-hours trading, falling at one point below $24 a share. That's an all-time low in Facebook's two-month existence as a publicly traded corporation.
What gives? There are a couple of interesting items from the earnings announcement, but one pattern that emerges is that Facebook's once-vaunted growth is slowing down.

A number of the bank's top executives, including its former chief executive, Robert E. Diamond Jr., resigned in the wake of the scandal, which involved some of the firm's traders and senior executives altering Libor submissions for financial gain.
Barclays disclosed on Friday that it was facing a number of class action lawsuits in the United States related to the manipulation of both Libor and the Euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor. The most recent lawsuit was filed at the beginning of July.

HIGHLIGHT: Memories of early 2011. 

 BODY:
Remember when the new Republican majority in the House called Ben Bernanke on the carpet
 Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the new chairman of the House Budget Committee and a vocal skeptic of the Fed's bond-buying effort, told Mr. Bernanke: "My concern is that the costs of the Fed's current monetary policy - the money creation and massive balance sheet expansion - will come to outweigh the perceived short-term benefits."
Mr. Ryan described "a sharp rise in a variety of key global commodity and basic material prices," and an increase in interest rates of longer-term Treasury securities. And while conceding that American consumers were not yet experiencing substantially higher prices, Mr. Ryan warned that "the inflation dynamic can be quick to materialize and painful to eradicate once it takes hold." 
Ahem:
The little upward blip at the end is drought, not monetary policy.
The point here isn't that Ryan is a fool; it is that his whole conceptual framework is wrong, wrong, wrong.
And it's not just cynical (though there's plenty of cynicism); we keep hearing about Republican politicians who are shorting Treasuries. Here's an earlier story involving Eric Cantor.

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Alleges Insider Trading on $15 Billion Cnooc Deal

BYLINE: AZAM AHMED


HIGHLIGHT: The Securities and Exchange Commission moves to freeze the assets of traders accused of illegally trading in shares in advance of the announced $15 billion acquisition of Nexen, a Canadian oil producer by the state-owned Chinese oil company, Cnooc. 

 BODY:
The Securities and Exchange Commission has moved to freeze the assets of traders accused of illegally trading in shares in advance of the announced $15 billion acquisition of a Canadian oil producer by the state-owned Chinese oil company, China National Offshore Oil Corporation, or Cnooc.
The action comes just days after the deal was announced, as the regulator seeks to prevent the proceeds from alleged insider trading from flowing back overseas and outside of its jurisdiction. 
In a complaint filed in the Federal District Court in Manhattan on Friday, the commission said that Well Advantage, a Hong Kong-based firm, stockpiled more than 830,000 shares of the Canadian company, Nexen, in the days before its acquisition based on material, non-public information. The regulator also accused other unnamed traders of making similar purchases. As a result, when the deal was announced on Monday and the share price of Nexen rose more than 60 percent, the traders earned a profit of nearly $13 million, the complaint alleges.
"Well Advantage and these other traders engaged in an all-too-familiar pattern of misusing inside information to place extremely timely trades and profit handsomely from their illegal acts," Sanjay Wadhwa, the deputy chief of the agency's market abuse unit and associate director of the New York regional office, said in a statement. "Despite the challenges of investigating misconduct in the U.S. by trading accounts located overseas, we have moved swiftly to freeze the assets of these suspicious traders and will hold them accountable for their actions."
The agency rushed to obtain a restraining order to freeze $38 million and presented it before a federal judge, who granted the asset freeze on Friday. The $38 million includes the overall proceeds from the trading, not just the profits.
Part of the rush is related to the difficulty that arises in retriving funds once they leave the United States. The company accused of insider trading, Well Advantage, is controlled by a well-known Hong Kong businessman, Zhang Zhi Rong, who controls another company with a "strategic cooperation agreement" with CNOOC, the government says.
The vast majority of the trading in Nexen took place several days before the deal was announced, and occurred in accounts that had little to no history of purchasing the shares in the past, the regulator said.

HEADLINE: What the New G.D.P. Figures Mean for the Election

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: Growth at 1.5 percent would ordinarily make a president's re-election prospects about 50-50. But our economic index still sees Mr. Obama as a very slight favorite because of low inflation. 

 BODY:
Let me begin with an important reminder. Unless you have a particular interest in economic or political forecasting, the major upshot of Friday's gross domestic product report, which estimated that the economy grew at an annualized rate of 1.5 percent in the second quarter, is simply that the American economy is still not doing very well. 
What economists call "trend" or average growth is supposed to be closer to 3 percent. Moreover, after many past recessions, we've had above-trend growth in the year or so after the recession to help make up for the lost productivity in the economy. 
We didn't have that this time around. After the latest revisions to the data, only two quarters since the recession officially ended came in above that 3 percent threshold; all the others were below it.
So, there remains an output gap of about $800 billion dollars. That's the difference between what economists think annual G.D.P. would be if the economy were at its full productive capacity, and what it actually is.
But we concern ourselves with the more narrow question of election forecasting at this blog. On that front, I agree with other analysts who suggest that the G.D.P. numbers don't contain all that much new information.
In the case of how our forecasting model is designed, this is true -- it does not use the backward-looking G.D.P. numbers.
The reason for this is simple: G.D.P. is reported on a quarterly basis. That's a bit slower than we'd like, when there are other good data series that have a shorter lead time.
Moreover, the initial estimates of G.D.P. are often very noisy. It's possible that Friday's numbers will eventually be revised to show that growth was actually negative, meaning that the economy was potentially in recession. It's also possible that they'll eventually be revised upward to show 3 percent growth or better. It's very common to see quarterly G.D.P. numbers revised by a full percentage point in one direction or the other, and reasonably common for the adjustments to be larger than that.
Instead, the bulk of our economic index (60 percent of the weight) is assigned to a series of four monthly indicators that correlate reasonably well with G.D.P. over the long run, and that economists use to help date recessions and recoveries.
These numbers are noisy too, of course - some more so than others. (The series called personal income, for instance, tends to get especially substantial revisions, while the jobs numbers are a bit more stable.) 
But if you look at what they say in combination with one another, you can usually get a reasonably good estimate of G.D.P. a couple of months before the figure is released.
That was the case here. The reported figures of 1.5 percent growth in the second quarter, and 2 percent growth in the first quarter, are consistent with what the economic index had already "priced in" to its expectations.
The chart below shows the normalized figures for the four G.D.P. proxies: payroll jobs, industrial production, personal consumption and personal income. The normalization process translates these numbers so that they are on the same scale as one another, and the same scale as quarterly G.D.P. reports.
The four indicators tell different stories about the economy. Income growth has been very poor, for example, while industrial production has been pretty encouraging. 
For better or for worse, this is a pretty normal state of affairs. Economic data is really noisy, and different series often diverge quite a bit, especially before revisions.
Still, if you average the four numbers together, you get an index of 1.7 percent growth. That almost exactly matches the G.D.P. growth rate during the previous six months, which is the period that our model is mostly concerned about.
Growth at this rate would ordinarily make a president's re-election prospects extremely tenuous: probably about 50-50, according to our model and others.
The reason our economic index sees Mr. Obama as a very modest favorite for re-election is because it also considers inflation, which is assigned 15 percent of the weight. And inflation has been very low.
Imagine the counterfactual: that on top of all the other problems in the economy, we also had, say 6 percent inflation. Then gas might cost $4.75 a gallon, and you'd notice the change in prices pretty frequently when you went to the grocery store. Under those circumstances, our model would have Mr. Obama as an underdog.
Of course, the G.D.P. numbers and other economic statistics are pretty tenuous on their own. If things get much worse than this in the next three-and-a-half months before the election, our economic index will start to see Mr. Obama as an underdog even with the low inflation rate.

HEADLINE: For the United States, Arab Spring Raises Question of Values Versus Interests

BYLINE: DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK


HIGHLIGHT: When he visited Cairo in 2009 to address the Muslim world, President Obama could not have guessed that the demand for Arab democracy would become one of his presidency's greatest foreign policy challenges. 

 BODY:
CAIRO - Barack Obama came here as a new president in 2009 to proclaim "a new beginning" in American relations with the Muslim world, grounded in support for the dream of Arab democracy and "governments that reflect the will of the people."
He could not have guessed that the demand for Arab democracy would instead become one of his presidency's greatest foreign policy challenges, forcing whoever wins the November election to confront tough trade offs between American values and interests. 
The popular uprisings that have swept the region since Mr. Obama's speech in Cairo have upended an authoritarian order that was largely congenial to the United States. While they may have brought Arab nations closer than ever to fulfilling of the promise of self-determination that has echoed through the speeches of American presidents since Woodrow Wilson at the end of the First World War, they have also imperiled crucial American allies, empowered antagonistic Islamists, and unleashed sectarian animosities that threaten to drag the whole region toward chaos. 
Before the uprisings, a rough balance of power held in check enemies like Iran. Israel and other allies were increasingly secure within their borders. Even Colonel Muammar el-Qaddafi, once the "mad dog of the Middle East," in President Ronald Reagan's words, was eager for closer ties with the United States, and American diplomats sent high-level emissaries to the Syrian capital, Damascus, in the hope of sweet-talking President Bashar al-Assad at least a few steps away from Tehran and closer to Washington.
Despite the strains caused by the invasion of Iraq and its bloody aftermath, American influence was arguably at an apex in the capitals of the Arab world if not the hearts and minds of the its people.
There was one deadly drawback. Washington's support for Arab autocracies drew the fire of militants who despaired of toppling their own monarchs and strongmen. That was the genesis of Al Qaeda. But those same Arab strongmen - including Hosni Mubarak in Egypt, Colonel Qaddafi in Libya, and President Zine al Abidine Ben Ali in Tunisia - were eager to lend their spies and jails to the American fight against terrorism. 
For the occupant of the White House, the upheaval has produced at least three pressing dilemmas. 
The first is the rising power of Islamists. Democratic elections in Egypt and Tunisia have brought to power Islamist parties historically opposed to United States policies in the region, from Washington's support for Israel to the American invasion of Iraq. At the same time, the toppling of the old secular strongmen has opened up a new debate among Islamists over just what Islamic governance should mean, including how to balance respect for individual freedom against traditional religious values. How can American policy makers assess the intents and agenda of the new Islamist leaders? Can the United States build productive alliances with these former foes? In Egypt, should the United States back the elected Islamists of the Muslim Brotherhood in their struggle to pry power from the hands of military leaders? The generals were once Washington's best friends in Egypt but now threaten to curtail the transition to democracy? 
The second challenge is the threat the insurgents pose to other undemocratic allies. Here the clearest case is in the tiny, oil-rich Kingdom of Bahrain. It is the home to the American fifth fleet and provides a vital base in the Persian Gulf. But its Sunni Muslim monarchs have used brutal force to crush a largely peaceful democracy movement backed by a Shiite Muslim majority. 
Can or should the United States push the king to yield power? Would that risk the rise of Shiite Muslim parties backed by Shiite Muslim Iran? Would it alienate other important allies like the monarchs of Saudi Arabia or Jordan? And if the American president continues to stand by the King of Bahrain - as the Obama administration has - can America still hold itself up as a champion of democratic values in the rest of the region?
The third challenge is the eruption of sectarian animosities long suppressed by the old autocrats. The most explosive case here is Syria. The uprising against Mr. Assad is also a battle between Syria's Sunni Muslim majority and his own minority Alawite Muslim sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam whose members dominate the Syrian military. Many of the Alawites fear annihilation at the hands of the Sunni insurgents seeking revenge for decades of repression by Mr. Assad and his father, former President Hafez al-Assad. Others in the region fear the Syrian conflict could become a regional proxy war pitting Shiite Iran on one side against Sunni Muslim Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the gulf states on the other. Sparks from the Syrian fighting have already shown the potential to reignite sectarian violence in neighboring Lebanon, around the border town of Tripoli.
Should the United States lend its support to the rebels challenging Mr. Assad, as Senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, both Republicans, have urged? How well does the United States know the rebels it might aid? And can Western policy makers prevent or contain a descent into sectarian violence, a grander and more catastrophic return of the kind of strife that engulfed neighboring Lebanon in a decade of civil war?
The situation is evolving by the day and often in unpredictable ways. It often seems distant from the domestic economic issues dominating the presidential campaign. But as Mr. Obama has learned since his speech in Cairo three years ago, events, welcome or not, have a way of imposing themselves on the White House.
Over the course of the campaign we will try to present arguments from Washington and the Middle East about how the White House might seek to advance American values and interests after "the new beginning" of the Arab spring. And we will re-examine the challenge over the next few months with each turn of events in the region. We are inviting experts and readers to weigh in and raise questions as we explore the issues, as part of a series we're calling The Agenda.

HEADLINE: New York: Not as Blue as It Could Be

BYLINE: SARAH WHEATON


HIGHLIGHT: Democrats dominate in statewide races, but if New York City voters start pulling more of their own weight, the hue will grow even deeper blue. 

 BODY:
New York's Democrats are underachievers. 
Sure, Barack Obama won the 2008 election in New York with 62.2 percent of the vote - behind only Hawaii, Vermont and Washington, D.C. - and Andrew M. Cuomo took the governor's mansion in 2010 with 62.6 percent. 
But in a state where almost half of the voters are registered Democrats, giving them a 2-to-1 advantage over registered Republicans, is that really such an accomplishment?
To understand the state's politics, it makes sense to divide New York into three regions: New York City, the downstate suburbs (Nassau and Suffolk Counties on Long Island, Westchester and Rockland Counties just north of the city), and the sprawling, diverse upstate region. 
As far as Democratic performance goes, New York City, the state's liberal economic engine, is the biggest slacker of all. A city that has not voted for a Republican for president since Calvin Coolidge in 1924 has not elected a Democratic mayor since 1989. The five boroughs also don't vote their weight: As Mr. Gyory notes, in 2008 New York City made up about 42 percent of the state's population, 38 percent of its registered voters and 34 percent of the vote - and that figure actually shows improvement over previous years.
Upstate New York, on the other hand, contributes 42 percent to 46 percent of the vote, despite having about 36 percent of the population and 39 percent of the registered voters, Mr. Gyory said. The region includes vast rural tracts, including the northernmost stretches of Appalachia, as well as dying manufacturing towns and the state's capital. Upstate's medium-size cities, like Rochester and Buffalo, fit a Rust Belt profile - people even say "pop" instead of "soda."
"A Democrat has a problem if he or she cannot carry at least 40 percent of the vote upstate," Mr. Gyory said. But 45 percent, he added, can almost guarantee a victory.
It's hard to blame New York's Democrats for resting on their laurels. The last time a Republican presidential candidate won the state was Ronald Reagan's landslide re-election in 1984, and the last Republican to win a statewide race was Gov. George Pataki, who was elected to a third term in 2002.
With the careers of Mr. Pataki and Rudolph W. Giuliani apparently over, the New York Republican Party has no standard-bearer. Republicans' small registration numbers hamper their ability to draw in undecided voters, because the conservative primary electorate tends to choose candidates well to the right of the state's mainstream. 
"It's getting bluer because the Republicans are not giving them much of a run for their money," Mr. Gyory said.
Case in point: In 2010, an energized Tea Party-infused Republican electorate chose Carl P. Paladino, a Buffalo businessman known more for his eccentricity than for his political acumen, over former Representative Rick A. Lazio of Long Island. (Earlier in the campaign, the head of the state Republican Party was so despondent about the party's chances that he tried to recruit a Democrat to switch parties and run against Mr. Cuomo on the Republican ticket.)
Mr. Cuomo beat Mr. Paladino by almost 30 points, and the state's Democratic United States senators won by similar margins. But as Mr. Greenberg pointed out, the Democrat running for attorney general won by 11 points, and Thomas P. DiNapoli won re-election to the comptroller's office by only 2.5 points. 
"So we clearly have swing voters," Mr. Greenberg said. 
But without moderates, Republicans might not be able to draw them in. 
"In gubernatorial years, New York is a Democrat, not a liberal, state," Mr. Gyory said. But he warns that if Republicans "continue to not run good candidates, they won't be able to take advantage of that distinction."
The Bellwethers 
According to Mr. Greenberg, even the "worst Democrat" would get 40 percent of the vote, and his or her terrible Republican rival would get about 25 percent. An additional 15 percent of voters are likely to favor Democrats in most cases, he said, so only about 20 percent of the electorate is truly up for grabs.
Where do these swing voters live? Westchester County is a key battleground. Immediately north of New York City, Westchester is one of the most ethnically diverse counties in the state, with growing Hispanic and Asian communities clustered in cities like Yonkers and New Rochelle. Efforts to integrate minorities into the county's graceful, affluent bedroom communities along the Hudson River with affordable-housing grants have caused tension, and the moves have put County Manager Rob Astorino - one of the few rising Republican stars - in the spotlight.
Mr. Greenberg looks to Westchester and to Erie County, where Buffalo is situated, to determine a Democrat's chances. 
"As a Democrat, you do what you're supposed to do in the city, you carry Westchester and Erie, you're going to win," he said. Republicans have a more daunting task.
"If a Republican is going to be competitive in New York State, they've got to carry the suburbs, they've got to carry upstate," Mr. Greenberg said. Republicans don't have to win upstate by a high margin, he added, but they need to amass "close to 60 percent" in the suburbs.
That's likely to be increasingly difficult. Though they once leaned Republican, Long Island's two counties are increasingly purple. Almost a third of Long Island's population is nonwhite, a dramatic shift. In Westchester, that figure is 35 percent. 
The other suburbs around Albany, Rochester, Buffalo and Syracuse are also competitive, and there are even some swing voters in New York City, including the white ethnic enclaves of the boroughs outside Manhattan, including Staten Island, which is home to the new 11th Congressional District, one of the most fiercely contested in the state. 
The Bottom Line
Making matters worse for Republicans, people from the state's more liberal areas are moving upstate. Northern Westchester through Saratoga, along the Hudson, has the state's highest rate of growth, according to Mr. Gyory. Many of the migrants are coming from New York City, drawn in particular by an emerging high-tech sector. (Mr. Obama visited the University at Albany's College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering in May.) The result, Mr. Gyory said, resembles "what's going on in North Carolina -- it's less predictably Republican than it was."
This isn't to say that there are no Republican bastions. On the contrary, Republicans hold a majority in the State Senate, with upstate's many rural districts sending conservatives to Albany.
"Democrats can't win upstate outside of major urban areas," Mr. Greenberg said. And down the ballot, "most of upstate is actually in play," he said. 
A shrinking population cost New York two House seats, bringing the number to 27. When it appeared that his district would be split, one upstate Democrat retired, and several of the redrawn districts incorporated greater shares of Republicans. But the Republican candidates will not have much help from the state and national parties. "They're not going to contest for the presidential; they don't have a strong Senate candidate," Mr. Gyory said. "They don't give a lot of air cover down-ballot."
As minorities and young people move to swing districts, and as New York City begins to vote more in proportion with its share of the population, the long-term trends don't look good for Republicans. But New York's cycles are slow.
"In New York, the party pendulum doesn't swing in four- and eight-year cycles," Mr. Gyory said. "It tends to swing in 16-to-20-year cycles."
This post incorrectly identified the years of some elections. Calvin Coolidge was first elected president in 1924, not 1922. (He took office in 1923 after the death of Warren G. Harding, and was elected to a full term the following year.) George Pataki was elected to a third term in 2002; he did not win his third re-election two decades ago, as originally stated. Also, following redistricting, Staten Island is in the 11th Congressional District, not the First. Finally, a graphic, now removed, included the wrong results for the 1980 presidential election. New Yorkers chose Ronald Reagan, the Republican, by 3 percent; the graphic erroneously showed the Democrat, Jimmy Carter, winning by that margin.

HEADLINE: July 27: Ohio Polls Show Trouble for Romney

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: It's by no means impossible that Mitt Romney could win the Electoral College despite losing Ohio, but it would be an uphill battle. 

 BODY:
I wrote earlier this week about some of the challenges in comparing state polls and national polls. Sometimes, apparent differences between the two sets of numbers can result from methodological quirks of the polling firms that are active in each arena, as well as random sampling error.
With that said, we are starting to see a bit of a gap between our Electoral College and popular vote forecasts based on the latest polling data this week -- one which potentially favors President Obama.
In general, the polls from nonswing states this week, ranging from New Jersey to North Dakota, were mediocre for Mr. Obama. But his numbers held up better in swing states.
Nowhere was this more apparent than in Ohio, where there were two new polls out on Friday. One of them, from the firm We Ask America, gave Mr. Obama an eight-point lead there. Another, from Magellan Strategies, put Mr. Obama up by two points.
Our model "thinks" the Magellan Strategies poll is a more realistic estimate of the state of play in Ohio. The model now forecasts a three-point victory for Mr. Obama there, which it translates to about a two-in-three chance of his winning the state given the uncertainty in the forecast.
Mr. Obama's projected three-point lead in Ohio is important for the following reason, however: it's slightly larger than the 2.4-point advantage that the model now gives Mr. Obama in the national popular vote.
In other words, based on the data so far this year, Ohio has been slightly Democratic-leaning relative to the country as a whole. That reflects a reversal from the usual circumstances. Normally, Ohio -- though very close to the national averages -- leans Republican by two points or so.
A split between the winners of the popular vote and the Electoral College is still relatively unlikely, in the view of the model. There is only a 3.9 percent chance that Mr. Obama will win the Electoral College but lose the popular vote, it estimates. 
However, the model now assigns just a 1.3 percent chance to the reverse happening: Mr. Romney's winning the Electoral College while losing the popular vote. 
Ohio is a big part of the reason. It's by no means impossible that Mr. Romney could win the Electoral College despite losing Ohio, but it would be an uphill battle.
If Mr. Obama won all the states that John Kerry did in 2004, and Ohio, he would have 264 electoral votes. 
Winning New Mexico in addition to these states, where Mr. Obama is heavily favored, would make the Electoral College a 269-269 tie. That is not necessarily a problem for Mr. Romney. The incoming House of Representatives is likely to contain a majority of Republican delegations, which would presumably vote for him under the 12th Amendment.
However, if Mr. Obama claimed any other competitive state that Mr. Kerry lost -- Nevada, Iowa, Virginia, Florida or Colorado, for example -- he would win the Electoral College outright, regardless of what happened in New Mexico. 
Of the states, Nevada is probably the most problematic for Mr. Romney. He has trailed in all the polls there, and it has increasingly begun to behave as a Democratic-leaning state.
Another plausible scenario is that Mr. Romney could win New Hampshire, which Mr. Kerry won in 2004, but lose New Mexico and Nevada. In that case, he'd lose the Electoral College by two votes, with 268 electoral votes to Mr. Obama's 270.
Alternatively, Mr. Romney could try to win one of the Midwestern states that Mr. Kerry won -- most likely, Pennsylvania, Michigan or Wisconsin. But these states have broadly similar demographics to Ohio, and it is unlikely that Mr. Romney would win them conditional upon losing the Buckeye State.
Although state economic statistics have only modest predictive power as compared with the national numbers, Mr. Obama may be benefiting from the fact that Ohio's unemployment rate has fallen substantially -- to 7.3 percent from a peak of 10.6 percent. Had the national unemployment rate declined by a similar margin, Mr. Obama would likely be a clear favorite in the election right now.
Much of the gain in Ohio has been from auto industry jobs, a relative bright spot in the economy, and a potential problem for Mr. Romney since he opposed the federal bailout of the major auto makers.
Mr. Romney could seek to even the score by naming Senator Rob Portman of Ohio as his vice-presidential nominee. Vice presidents do not make as much difference as the conventional wisdom sometimes holds: a net gain of two points by appointing a home-state candidate is a roughly realistic estimate, although it can vary a lot from case to case. Still, gaining two points in Ohio would provide a pretty meaningful push to Mr. Romney given the way that the polls look right now.
Mr. Obama also benefited on Friday from the rise in the stock market, which improved the model's economic index. The S. & P. 500 closed at 1,386 points on Friday, its highest figure since May.
The stock market is likely to remain volatile in the weeks ahead, as investors seek to weigh the consequences of critical economic news -- including next Friday's jobs report, possible actions by the Federal Reserve to stimulate the economy and efforts by the European Central Bank to defend the euro zone.
My personal read on the stock market is that it seems to be pricing in a fairly high likelihood of stimulative actions by central banks, both in the United States and Europe. If investors do not get what they are hoping for, it could decline significantly.
In the meantime, Mr. Romney's campaign will need to consider whether it trusts the polls showing him down in Ohio, and if so, what actions it might take to remedy that problem.

HEADLINE: Taiwan's Progress on Health Care

BYLINE: UWE E. REINHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: Taiwan not only has in place a national health care system, but it also takes advantage of information technology far more frequently than the United States does, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Uwe E. Reinhardt is an economics professor at Princeton. He has some financial interests in the health care field. 
Several years ago I wrote "Humbled in Taiwan," a commentary for The British Medical Journal.
The piece was prompted by a conversation between a health services researcher and the head of health information technology of Taiwan's Bureau of National Health Insurance, which administers Taiwan's single-payer national health insurance system. By that time, virtually all of Taiwan's claims were billed electronically.
In that conversation, the bureau's head of health information technology lamented that some hospitals and physicians in Taiwan still failed to submit fully completed claims forms for encounters with patients within 24 hours of the encounter. 
Twenty-four hours?

In the United States, claims settlement for medical procedures under private health insurance can take up to three months; it takes about three weeks for Medicare. As I noted in my commentary for The British Medical Journal, "private health insurance companies in the United States count themselves lucky if high-priced actuaries can tell them in the middle of the year what the carrier ultimately will have to pay the providers of health care for services rendered in the previous year." 
Since 1995, Taiwan's 23 million people have enjoyed universal, comprehensive health insurance coverage under its single-payer national health insurance system, which is financed by a mixture of payroll contributions from employers and employees and government subsidies. 
The system is administered by the Bureau of National Health Insurance, whose administrative budget absorbs less than 2 percent of the system's total spending for health care benefits. Over all, Taiwan spends about 6.9 percent of its gross domestic product on health care, compared with close to 18 percent spent in the United States. (More detail on the genesis of the system and its modus operandi can be found in this article in Health Affairs and on the bureau's Web site.)
About two weeks ago, I attended the Europe-Taiwan Health Dialogue, held in Taipei. That two-day conference was sponsored jointly by Taiwan's Department of Health and the European Health Forum Gastein, whose European Health Forums are among the leading platforms for discussions on health policy and are attended by participants from around the world. (My travel to the conference, to which I was invited as an academic expert, was underwritten by the Department of Health.)
As an American, I found myself humbled again by a presentation, "Information Technology and Patient-Centered Care - the Case of Taiwan," delivered by Dr. Min-Huei Hsu, director of the Medical Informatics Center of Taiwan's Department of Health.
Dr. Hsu's presentation brought to my mind a chapter on health information, which, as chairman of the New Jersey Commission on Rationalizing Health Care Resources, I wrote for the final report published in January 2008. In that chapter I sketched out the vision for a 21st-century health information system for New Jersey that had emerged from discussion among the commissioners. 
Alas, more often than not, the work of such commissions amounts to howling into the wind in our latitudes. It certainly did in that case. 
But, in Taiwan, I saw much of such a system in place and fully operating, and mused how long it might take New Jersey, and much of America, for that matter, to come this far.
In Taiwan, the Department of Health, the very active Bureau of Health Promotion, the Centers for Disease Control and other governmental administrative functions are linked in a network that allows a select set of professionals access to its database, under strict controls to secure privacy. Clinics, hospitals and pharmacies are also linked to this central database. 
Among other things, this data system allows the guardians of public health to detect quickly the incidence of certain illness that may be infectious, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS.
Now in its third year is a clinical interface among health care facilities that already includes half of Taiwan's 500 hospitals. By 2016, all Taiwan's hospitals and 20,000 clinics where physicians practices are to be on this electronic medical record system.
This data system allows physicians in one hospital or clinic to get access to an individual patient's medical record, but only under strict conditions of privacy. The record includes hospital discharge summaries and medical records from outpatient visits, including prescriptions, lab tests and digital images. Such data-sharing among clinicians in different health care facilities or systems is rare in the United States. Again, roughly half of Taiwan's 500 hospitals are already linked in this way, in the system's third year. 
To access a patient's file requires that the physician has an authorized digital signature to do so and, more important, that the patient has swiped his or her own, personal electronic smart card through the specialized card reader on every physician's desk, thus authorizing the access.
That card reader has slots for both the patient's and the physician's electronic smart card. It links patient and physician directly to the data center of the Bureau of National Health Insurance at the very time the encounter takes place. Thus it allows the bureau to track health care use virtually in real time and also to monitor the behavior of patients given to excessive doctor shopping.
Touring a rural area, we saw mobile clinics on wheels, equipped with imaging devices (mammography scanners, sonar scanners and X-ray machines) for general check-ups of rural populations in remote areas. In front of the mobile clinics sat young technicians with laptops, linking to the Bureau of National Health Insurance data center both patients and physicians, with the latter also having access to the patients' medical records.
The information network also includes electronic kiosks in hospital lobbies; about half of Taiwan's hospitals now feature such kiosks. Using a secure identification card, a patient can make an appointment with a doctor or review her own medical record, including results from tests or scans. To find more about what the test results might indicate, she could use electronic links to explanations. Finally, since all medicines are bar-coded, she might consult the kiosk about the specifics of drugs prescribed for her. 
Currently in the field are pilot studies for a national tele-health project for long-term care. 
I am sure that there are pockets here and there in the United States with similarly advanced health information technology. Kaiser Permanante, for example, is bound to be as advanced and perhaps even more so. The Veterans Administration is known for its electronic health information system. Some larger health systems and academic health centers may also have highly developed intra-system information systems.
But I wonder how many Americans today can walk up to a multifunction kiosk, find their own medical records, make appointments with doctors and learn there about lab tests and prescription drugs. I wonder how many American doctors today can reach their patients' complete medical records across different health care facilities and systems. 
I do not want to romanticize Taiwan health care. Like any health system, it has its share of problems, all the more so because, at only 6.7 percent of G.D.P., the system is underfunded by at least a percentage point or so, using international standards. 
I also am persuaded that Taiwan needs a larger supply of doctors. Nor would even Taiwan's health experts assert that their health information system is perfect. It remains a work in progress.
But a national health system must be judged not only by the level of health care it delivers, but by what it offers its citizens for the money they spend on it - by its cost-effectiveness, in professional jargon. 
In the United States, the Business Roundtable concluded in a 2010 study that given its high level of spending on health care, the American system shows a 23 percent value gap relative to what Europeans spend and get in return, and a 46 percent value gap relative to spending in Asian countries, including Taiwan, Japan, South Korea and Singapore.
At its best, the American health system probably is unrivaled in the world, staffed by highly trained and hard-working doctors and nurses. For the most part, it boasts luxurious health care facilities. 
Oddly and sadly, however, the United States has yet to harvest the full benefits of modern electronic health information. Our nation's engineers and entrepreneurs design smart hardware and software for health care, but we do not seem to use our own products as smartly as do many other countries.

HEADLINE: Agreement On Back Pay For Laborers

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Nicholas Lettire has won awards and political support for building affordable housing in Harlem and the Bronx, and for employing local workers at his construction sites.
But Mr. Lettire did not always make sure that those workers were paid proper wages and benefits on at least two projects, even as he took federal housing money, according to the United States Department of Labor.
The Labor Department announced on Thursday that Mr. Lettire, a founder of Lettire Construction, had agreed to guarantee payment of about $960,000 in back wages and fringe benefits for dozens of workers employed by his subcontractors as part of a settlement of a case brought against the company last year. 
The company and Mr. Lettire also agreed to hire a monitor approved by the Labor Department to ensure that it complies with labor laws and contracting requirements. At the same time, the company agreed to investigate prospective subcontractors for their ability to pay prevailing wages on federally subsidized projects and establish an electronic timekeeping system.
The case involved Hobbs Court and Ciena, two affordable housing projects in East Harlem that were among the first to receive federal stimulus money, in 2009, during the economic downturn.
''This settlement makes absolutely clear that responsibility for complying with the federal prevailing wage laws rests with Lettire Construction and Nicholas Lettire,'' Nancy J. Leppink, a deputy administrator at the Labor Department, said in a statement. ''The agreement requires them to take those actions that any 'high road' contractor should be taking to ensure its compliance and the compliance of its subcontractors with federal law on federal taxpayer-funded projects.''
After a lengthy investigation last year, the Labor Department took legal action, originally seeking to bar Lettire Construction and 16 of the 23 subcontractors from working on federally financed projects. Regulators claimed that the companies ''willfully violated wage, benefit, certified payroll and other requirements'' at the Ciena and Hobbs Court projects.
Lettire Construction has agreed to pay $3,071 in back wages to four of its employees. Fourteen of the subcontractors resolved the charges by paying a total of $142,345 in back wages and benefits to 85 mechanics and laborers.
The department barred for three years Fairmont Industries, Sant-Tec Electric and Finest Security Service. The Labor Department is also seeking to bar Gladiators Contracting, as well as Enviro and Demo Masters, and obtain $815,638 in back wages and benefits for 40 mechanics and laborers.
Pedro Pablo, a demolition laborer who had worked on the Ciena project, said he was gratified by the settlement. Mr. Pablo said he had worked seven days a week, for 70 hours or more, over three months under sometimes dangerous conditions and often without water breaks. The subcontractor, he said, paid $13 an hour in cash, no overtime. ''I'm glad we'll be compensated for the hard work we did,'' Mr. Pablo said. ''We worked very hard, and it was very hot.''
In November, Mr. Lettire and a development partner, Jonathan Rose, received the Jack Kemp Workforce Housing Models of Excellence award from the Urban Land Institute for a project in Harlem, a 12-story residential building called Tapestry, at 124th Street and Second Avenue. The building, which has many environmentally sensitive features, has 185 apartments, half of which are market-rate, with the remaining units split between low- and middle-income tenants.
But Mr. Lettire has run afoul of officials on more than just Hobbs Court and the Ciena. The city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development has cited his company eight times for failure to comply with labor laws and withheld more than $5 million.
The city cooperated with the Labor Department investigation and has ceased working with the company, according to a department spokeswoman, Katy Marshall.
Robert Bonanza, business manager for the Mason Tenders District Council, which had picketed Lettire job sites and assisted the workers, said the settlement ''sends a clear message to anyone who has either worked in the past, or intends to work in the future, on publicly funded, affordable housing projects: exploitation of workers will not be tolerated.'' He added: ''Building affordable housing is a goal we all support and agree is necessary, but not at the expense of exploiting workers.''
Allan Bahn, a lawyer for Mr. Lettire, said that the company was committed to ''doing the right thing.'' After being informed of the problem with the subcontractors in 2010, Lettire, he said, hired an independent monitor and instituted many of the procedures now outlined in the consent decree. He said the company would be cleared to work on projects after the settlement was approved.
Ms. Marshall said, ''We have no plans for any future developments involving Lettire.''

HEADLINE: A Makeover for the Olympics Leaves East London Optimistic

BYLINE: By KATRIN BENNHOLD and STEPHEN CASTLE

 BODY:
LONDON -- Amber Charles still remembers the wasteland behind Stratford station, the hooded youths lingering across the street by the McDonald's and her mother's instruction not to walk the dirt track leading to their housing development after dark.
Today, a sparkling new Olympic stadium and state-of-the art shopping mall have replaced the once-bleak expanse and the hooded youths are nowhere to be seen. What was once a dirt track has become a paved street complete with a road sign.
''This looks nothing like the place I grew up in,'' said Ms. Charles, who is 23 and has ambitions to play basketball for Britain in the 2016 Olympics.
Even before the 2012 Games formally open on Friday night, East London, an area with some of the highest unemployment and crime rates in the country, has been visibly transformed by holding the world's biggest sporting event. More than $:9 billion, or $14 billion, has been poured into the Games, including building Olympic facilities, upgrading public transportation and scrubbing up the high streets near game venues, the government says. The new shopping mall alone has brought about 8,000 jobs. 
Ms. Charles, who was brought up by a single mother of Caribbean descent and is now studying in the United States on a sports scholarship, played her part in that transformation: Along with 34 other teenagers from mainly working-class and ethnically mixed districts, she was flown to Singapore in 2005 to persuade the International Olympic Committee that her generation needed the Games to bring hope and opportunity to their neighborhoods. Rather than representing sponsors, they represented a real-life snapshot of London's future: There were Humaira Patel in her Muslim head scarf, then 13, and Gurpreet Virdee, a 14-year-old Sikh. There was Danielle Latimer, 16, with thick blond hair and an equally thick East London accent, and Alexandros Loukos, the son of a Greek immigrant and, at 12, the youngest in the group.
It was an impressive publicity strategy -- and one that may well have secured London the decisive winning vote. But seven years later, despite the visible improvements, it is unclear how impressive the actual legacy for the area and its youths will turn out to be.
During a recent stroll through Stratford's gleaming new cityscape it was hard to judge what is lasting change and what facade: For all the celebrations of a multicultural and multifaith Olympics, some Muslim residents fasting for Ramadan complained that their local mosque had been shut down by an Olympic roadblock, forcing them to travel 45 minutes to another district.
A man begging across the street from the new shopping center was quickly surrounded by half a dozen plainclothes police officers and urged to move on.
The benefits office near the station with groups of unemployed people routinely lining up outside has been razed to make way for a new office building. But at almost 19 percent, unemployment in the area is more than twice the national average. Olympic construction has now largely been concluded and, while it provided a boost, it did no more than blunt the impact of the current recession.
Colin Ellis, senior vice president for credit policy at Moody's Investor Services, said construction activity had declined by 10 percent since 2008.
''Clearly it was beneficial, but what happened was not enough to offset the wider falls in the sector,'' he said. ''Looking at the big picture, we think that corporate sponsors will benefit most. The Olympics are unlikely to provide a substantial economic boost.''
Some go further, arguing that the legacy of the Olympics for residents could prove negative, rather than just minor: retailers worry that the new shopping mall will eat into their business. Tenants fear a permanent increase in rents.
Glyn Robbins, a campaigner who works in the social housing sector, believes that only about 17 percent of the housing units generated by the Games will be affordable to those in most need -- half the official target of 35 percent.
''My prediction is that it will become an area that excludes people from East London who are on low incomes, and the working class people will not feel part of the Olympic legacy,'' Mr. Robbins said. ''What we are going to find, once the carnival has moved on, is that very few people who live in the area and need housing are going to be able to afford to live in the neighborhood.''
But for now, particularly among teenagers and young adults, including the 35 who went to Singapore all those years ago, optimism largely prevails.
Mr. Loukos, now 19, points to improvement in public transportation linking remote corners of East London to not just different parts of central London but also to mainland Europe.
''Who would have thought 10 years ago that you could go from Stratford to Europe?'' he said, referring to plans to make Stratford part of a larger European high-speed rail network.
His commute to work at a cable company has gotten faster and less crowded as light-railway trains run more often and with more cars.
Jelani Lewis, 23, who arrived in East London from the Caribbean with his family when he was 10, said he used to fear the gang violence near the McDonald's in central Stratford. The recent redevelopment has changed that.
''There used to be stabbings around here all the time,'' he said, ''but I haven't heard about one in about four years.''
Several members of the group have family or friends who were unemployed and found an Olympic-linked job. One of Ms. Charles's childhood friends works as part of a security team. ''It's short-term,'' Ms. Charles said, ''but she got training and it could lead to other things.''
Mr. Lewis's mother, who had not worked in years, helps with the logistics at one of the Olympic venues.
Ms. Patel, 20, says she is proud that the Games have put Stratford on the map -- and for reasons other than poverty and deprivation. A student of criminal law, she does community service with young offenders in Stratford.
''The Games have made them proud to be from East London,'' she said. ''For the first time, their community is associated with something positive.''
To those who say that the billions pumped into Olympic preparation could have been spent to greater effect if explicitly focused on the regeneration of East London, Ms. Patel and others retort that funds on this scale would simply never have been made available had it not been for the Olympic Games.
They made light of some of the grumbling among other residents.
''Moaning is a British sport,'' Ms. Latimer said. ''If it was an Olympic discipline we'd definitely win.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Man, 21, Arrested in Killing of Student in New Jersey

BYLINE: By VIVIAN YEE

 BODY:
A 21-year-old man was arrested on Friday and charged with murder in the shooting death of a Villanova University student from Connecticut who was found dead in an apartment building in Montclair, N.J., the authorities said. 
The man, Ernest Williams Jr. of Montclair, is also charged with robbery and two weapons offenses in the killing of the student, Brian Schiavetti, 21, of Ridgefield, Conn.
On Sunday, the police found Mr. Schiavetti's body on a landing in an apartment building in Montclair, a town where homicides are rare. Mr. Schiavetti was working at Thomson Reuters in Manhattan this summer and had no apparent connection with either Montclair or the apartment building where he was killed.
A spokeswoman for the Essex County prosecutor's office, Katherine Carter, said Mr. Williams was unemployed. She declined to comment on what led to the arrest or on any other details of the investigation. It is unclear whether Mr. Schiavetti knew Mr. Williams or why he was in Montclair. Residents of the apartment building said this week that many tenants were transients, and that drug deals were common there.
After the arrest, Anthony Schiavetti, the victim's brother, said that he had never heard of Mr. Williams, and that as far as he knew, his brother had not known him, either.
''I'm sure the system will work itself out,'' Mr. Schiavetti, a lawyer, said. ''I don't know that that'll bring any solace to my family. I know it won't bring my brother back.''
Mr. Williams is being held at the Essex County Correctional Facility on $750,000 bail. He is scheduled to be arraigned in Superior Court on Tuesday morning.

HEADLINE: On East River, Giving Mussels a Place to Call Home

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
Now don't start chopping shallots, but we thought you'd be interested to know that an artificial mussel bed - believed to be the first of its kind along the city shoreline - is under construction on the East River.
The habitat, two submerged V-shaped concrete troughs studded with about 340 rocks, is part of a new ''eco-park'' in the East River Waterfront Esplanade. The $165 million esplanade project, by the New York City Economic Development Corporation, extends about a mile and a half from Pier 35 down to the Battery Maritime Building. The corporation would not break out the cost of the mussel bed, whose home will be at Pier 35, near Rutgers Slip. 
The park will open to the public next year. It already is open to any mussel daring enough to thread its way through a construction zone and hitch its beard to a chunk of granite atop a steel dowel embedded in concrete.
On July 1, workers for the Hunter Roberts Construction Group began installing 30 big concrete blocks, weighing 11 to 59 tons each, that compose the mussel bed. The job will continue through August. The blocks were fabricated in Schuylerville, N.Y.; then taken by barge to Newark, where the rocks were attached; then barged again to Pier 35. They are made especially heavy to keep them weighted down in place.
David Kane, the executive vice president for capital programs at the Economic Development Corporation, said creating the marine habitat allowed officials to piggyback an educational and environmental feature on infrastructural work that had to be done in any case: the reconstruction of a deteriorated storm sewer outfall pipe at the foot of Pier 35. The mussel bed is being installed on top of the outfall.
At best, the 65-foot-long habitat will attract colonies of blue mussels and ribbed mussels. An environmental consulting firm, Great Ecology, determined that a mussel bed would be feasible in this location, city officials said.
East River water quality has improved considerably since the 1970s. One critical yardstick, the level of fecal coliform bacteria in 100 milliliters of water (about 6.7 tablespoons) has dropped to 118 from 160,000. But city officials do not anticipate that the mussels will be fit for human consumption, especially since the bed sits so close to a sewer outfall.
Though unusual in its scope, the mussel bed is not unique among efforts to provide such habitats in New York waterways. For example, artificial reefs known as reef balls have been installed at Hunts Point Landing in the Bronx.
Even if the bed at Pier 35 fails to attract mussels, officials envision it as an unusual abstract sculpture that can be used to study the extent and effect of tides. A little bridge will cross over the mouth of the habitat, which occupies a small cove. At high tide, the structure will be almost entirely under water. At low tide, it will be almost completely exposed. Maritime grasses will border it at one edge.
Neither state nor federal regulatory agencies required such a habitat, Mr. Kane said, adding, ''This was about doing something new.''
The ''eco-park'' and walkway on Pier 35 will be screened from the adjoining Sanitation Department shed on Pier 36 by an inclined vine-covered wall. The lead project manager for the Economic Development Corporation is Terri Bahr. The designers of the esplanade are SHoP Architects and Ken Smith Landscape Architect; engineering is by a joint venture between HDR and Arup. Ocean and Coastal Consultants served as structural marine engineer for the mussel bed.
All this expertise and it will still be up to the mussels themselves to decide whether it was worth the effort. How will we know if they start moving in?
Get ready for Mussel Cam 2013. (But please put the shallots away.)
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Police Shootings in Anaheim Highlight Deep Rifts in a Community

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA

 BODY:
ANAHEIM, Calif. -- Just before sunset, a police patrol car meandered down Anna Drive, passing a mother buying her children ice cream and a small group of young men gathered on the sidewalk. Both groups shouted at the car: ''Get out of here!'' ''What's your badge number?'' and ''Shame on you!'' The patrol car did not stop, nor did another that came by about 15 minutes later.
On this small U-shaped street about five miles north of Disneyland, the anger and frustration are palpable. 
Last Saturday, the police shot and killed a 25-year-old man here who was apparently unarmed. Hours after the shooting, protests broke out on the streets, with some residents throwing bottles at the police, officers said, who responded with pepper spray and beanbag bullets. A police dog broke free from a car and attacked a woman and her two children.
''After all that, what are they even doing?'' said Ricardo Hurtado, 21, who grew up in the area, as he watched the second police car pass by. ''They can't think they're welcome here. Nobody even wants to see them. It's like they want to make us more mad.''
The next day a 21-year-old man was also killed by the police, who said he had tried to run away and later opened fire. Early Friday morning, the police opened fire on a burglary suspect who was trying to escape. It was the eighth police shooting so far this year. Five have been fatal.
These shootings have exposed deep fury in a city that is better known as being home to the happiest place on earth. About 1,000 demonstrators showed up at a City Council meeting on Tuesday night, leading to outbreaks of violence and two dozen arrests.
The police were bracing for more protests over the weekend and said they had adopted a zero-tolerance stance against any city code violations, like loitering.
In this largely working-class city of more than 340,000 people, the divisions are as varied as they are deep. While more than half of the city is Latino, only three Latinos have ever been elected to the City Council. But the rift is as much about class as it is about race.
For many activists, the blame lies with the City Council, whose members are primarily from eastern hills on the city's edge, the wealthiest and least populated part of town. They complain that the Council has focused exclusively on development in the resort area at the expense of the city's poor neighborhoods.
Earlier this year, the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California filed a lawsuit against the city of Anaheim claiming that the current City Council election system, with each candidate running at large rather in a particular neighborhood, underrepresents Latinos, who make up a third of all voters in the city. One study cited by the A.C.L.U. found that the wealthier area of Anaheim Hills has more parks, libraries, fire stations and community centers than any other part of the city.
For others, the shootings have thrust into the spotlight long-held complaints about the police. On Anna Drive, where Saturday's shooting of Manuel Diaz occurred, resentment against the police has been building for years. Young men here say they have been stopped by officers more times than they can count, often, they say, for doing nothing more than walking down the street.
And the problems here go deeper. Unemployment in the city is about 10 percent, higher than in the rest of Orange County, and many young people in the neighborhood have been unable to find work for months at a time. In some cases a juvenile criminal record is another strike against them.
''We get harassed all the time, just for the way we look and hanging out,'' said Rafael Brito, 23, who grew up with Mr. Diaz. ''As soon as they see you, they're ready to pull their gun and start asking you what gang you're with and what they call you. They do it all day every day.''
Last Saturday, Mr. Brito said, he began crossing in the middle of the street, holding a protest poster with both hands. About halfway through, he saw a police officer heading toward him with his hand on his gun holster. The officer then grabbed Mr. Brito's arm and told him he was citing him for jaywalking.
A makeshift memorial in front of the yard where Mr. Diaz died includes many pointed messages: ''Anaheim police is death squad'' and ''Beware of the cops they kill our kids, you might be next.''
Police officials say the area around Anna Drive, like other parts of the city, has had a rise in violent crime over the past year or so. Sgt. Bob Dunn, a spokesman for the department, said that officers were also finding more illegal firearms in the area, which they attribute to gang activity.
Officials have mostly remained silent on the circumstances surrounding last weekend's shootings, saying they are waiting for investigations by the district attorney and federal officials to be completed. But the police union has said that both men who were shot were gang members.
Mr. Diaz's family has disputed that, and their lawyer said that ''if you're Mexican and bald, you're assumed to be a gang member.'' Like the City Council, the police force is largely white; including civilians, Latinos make up 28 percent of the overall department.
In some cases, people admit to being involved in a street gang, but the police often make the determination themselves. Sergeant Dunn said sometimes they were identified by other gang members or tattoos.
Amin David, 79, created Los Amigos, a Latino civil rights group, after tensions with the police exploded about 40 years ago. Eventually, the group successfully implemented sensitivity training for police officers. But Mr. David said that many of the same problems were recurring now.
''We have these issues that fester and cannot seem to go away,'' Mr. David said. ''Crime is a real issue here, and in some pockets of the city people are afraid of the police. We need to figure out how to create a dimension of calmness.''
On Thursday, children could be spotted in the yards of the small buildings that line Anna Drive. But many residents say they are worried about crime in the area. During a community meeting earlier this year, one 9-year-old girl wrote a letter to the police saying, ''I can't even play outside 'cause sometimes they hide in the laundry to drink and do bad stuff.''

HEADLINE: A Five-Ring Opening Circus, Weirdly and Unabashedly British

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL; Campbell Robertson, Christopher Clarey, Victor Mather, Andrew Das and Stephen Castle contributed reporting.

 BODY:
LONDON -- With its hilariously quirky Olympic opening ceremony, a wild jumble of the celebratory and the fanciful; the conventional and the eccentric; and the frankly off-the-wall, Britain presented itself to the world Friday night as something it has often struggled to express even to itself: a nation secure in its own post-empire identity, whatever that actually is.
The noisy, busy, witty, dizzying production somehow managed to feature a flock of sheep (plus a busy sheepdog), the Sex Pistols, Lord Voldemort, the engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel, a suggestion that the Olympic rings were forged by British foundries during the Industrial Revolution, the seminal Partridge Family reference from ''Four Weddings and a Funeral,'' a group of people dressed like so many members of Sgt. Pepper's band, some rustic hovels tended by rustic peasants, ''(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction'' and, in a paean to the National Health Service, a zany bunch of dancing nurses and bouncing sick children on huge hospital beds.
It was neither a nostalgic sweep through the past nor a bold vision of a brave new future. Rather, it was a sometimes slightly insane portrait of a country that has changed almost beyond measure since the last time it hosted the Games, in the grim postwar summer of 1948. 
Britain was so poor then that it housed its athletes in old army barracks, made them bring their own towels and erected no buildings for the Games. The Olympics cost less than $:750,000, turned a small profit and made the nation proud that it had managed to rise to the occasion in the face of such adversity.
There was that same sense of relief intermingled with self-satisfaction this time. But such was the grandeur of 2012, even in these tough economic times, that 80,000 people sat comfortably in a new Olympic Stadium, having traveled by sleek new bullet trains and special V.I.P. road lanes to a new park that has completely transformed once-derelict east London.
A little rain fell, but it hardly mattered. Queen Elizabeth II was there, after co-starring with a tuxedoed Daniel Craig, also known as James Bond, in a witty video in which she appears to parachute from a helicopter (in fact, she entered the park the usual way). Looking mystified at times -- the ceremony was pitched to a generation different from hers -- she presided over a bevy of lesser royals and Prime Minister David Cameron.
The first lady, Michelle Obama, was in the audience to cheer on the United States athletes, who, it must be said, did a lot of cheering for themselves anyway during the athletes' procession. And Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, was there, too, although he was practically Public Enemy No. 1 around here after he appeared to question the British capacity for enthusiasm, something only Britons are allowed to do.
One of the biggest secrets of the night -- who would light the Olympic caldron -- was revealed at the end of the 3-hour-45-minute show, when seven teenage athletes took over from the British rower Steve Redgrave, who carried the torch into the stadium. The ceremony, conceived and directed by the filmmaker Danny Boyle, was two years in the making. As is the case almost every Olympics, much of the speculation around it centered on how Britain could possibly surpass the previous summer host, China. In 2008, Beijing used its awe-inspiring opening extravaganza to proclaim in no uncertain terms that it was here, it was rich, and the world better get used to it.
But outdoing anyone else, particularly the new superpower China, was not the point for a country that can never hope to re-create the glory days of its empire. Mr. Cameron, the prime minister, said this week that London's are ''not a state-run Games -- it is a people-run Games,'' and Boris Johnson, the London mayor, noted sharply that Britain was not planning to ''spend our defense budget'' on ''pyrotechnics'' but would take pride in being ''understated but confident.''
That the Olympics come at a time of deep economic malaise, with Britain teetering on the edge of a double-dip recession, the government cutting billions of dollars from public spending, and Europe lurching from crisis to crisis, made the scene a bit surreal, even defiant in the face of so much adversity.
The crowd in the stadium sat in a bubble of excitement. In the wider park, volunteers have been behaving with an enthusiasm that seems bewilderingly un-British. But out in the rest of the country, critics have been questioning the expense, the ubiquitously heavy-handed security apparatus, and the rampant commercialism of the Games.
In The Guardian, the columnist Marina Hyde said government officials appeared to be rashly depending on the Olympics, which cost an estimated $:9.3 billion (or $14.6 billion), to save the country's struggling economy virtually single-handedly.
Referring to a British track-and-field star, Ms. Hyde wrote that according to the government's thinking, ''Jessica Ennis winning gold is no longer merely a sporting aspiration but something that would cause a massive and immediate recalibration of the balance of payments.''
The final cost, or benefit, of the Games will never really be known. But for now, the fact that things went smoothly on Friday was in itself a minor cause for celebration.
Mr. Boyle said he did not want to seem extravagant, particularly in a time of economic trouble, as he was given the daunting task of trying to find a way for Britain to account for itself in this difficult moment in its long history. The country has always eagerly celebrated its past: its military victories, its kings and queens, its glorious cultural and intellectual achievements. But it has a harder time celebrating its present.
A quixotic exercise in self-branding, during which the then-Labour government thought to unite the country by coming up with what it called a British ''statement of values,'' devolved into near-farce a few years ago when the public greeted it with ridicule rather than enthusiasm. The Times of London mischievously sponsored a motto-writing contest; the winner was ''No Motto Please, We're British.''
The ceremony seemed to reflect that view, too, suggesting that the thing that is most British about the British is their anarchic spirit and their ability to laugh at themselves. It is hard to imagine, for instance, the Chinese including, as the British did, a clip of the comic actor Rowan Atkinson inserted into the opening scene from ''Chariots of Fire,'' shoving the other runners out of the way (and ending with a rude noise paying tribute to British lavatorial humor).
The ceremony, too, reflected the deeply left-leaning sensibilities of Mr. Boyle. It pointedly included trade union members among a parade of people celebrating political agitators from the past, a parade that also included suffragists, Afro-Caribbean immigrants who fought for minority rights, and the Jarrow hunger marchers, who protested against unemployment in 1936.
It would not be lost on Mr. Boyle that unions have suffered in Britain in recent years, particularly at the hands of the Conservative Party, led by Mr. Cameron. But he devised the ceremony, he said, with no political interference.
That proved highly irritating to at least one politician, Aiden Burley, a Conservative member of Parliament, who denounced on Twitter what he referred to as the ceremony's ''leftie multicultural'' content.
''The most leftie opening ceremony I have ever seen -- more than Beijing, the capital of a communist state!'' he posted grumpily.
Who knows how the country will feel when the Olympics are over? But when the British athletes entered the stadium at the end of the procession of countries, they did so to a recording of David Bowie, a quintessential British oddity and supreme self-reinventor. ''We can be heroes,'' the song goes, ''just for one day.''

HEADLINE: In U.S. Agency, Drillers in Utah Have a Friend

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON

 BODY:
VERNAL, Utah -- Bill Stringer leaned into the office of his top deputy here at the Bureau of Land Management one recent day to share his latest victory.
''We got upheld!'' Mr. Stringer said, meaning his bosses in Salt Lake City had gone along with his staff's recommendation to allow oil drilling near Desolation Canyon, a national historic site known for its pristine wilderness and white-water rafting. Despite objections from environmentalists, more oil wells would dot the huge stretch of federal land Mr. Stringer oversees.
Mr. Stringer, 55, who sports a goatee, rides a motorcycle and sometimes wears rock bandT-shirts to work, is a little-known manager in an agency many Americans have never heard of, but he is arguably as powerful as many of Utah's elected officials. As head of the bureau's outpost in northeast Utah, he and his colleagues make decisions that have affected livelihoods and largely favored oil and natural gas companies eager to join in a national energy boom. The companies' lobbying efforts extend beyond Washington to officials across the West, including Mr. Stringer here in Vernal, population 9,000. 
The Bureau of Land Management, part of the Interior Department, is the nation's biggest landlord, controlling 248 million acres, including nearly half the land in Utah. Charged with protecting public lands while exploiting their resources -- for mining, drilling, timbering, ranching -- Mr. Stringer's agency has been at the center of a fierce battle in recent years as companies have sought to lease federal property and get drilling permits.
The Bush administration encouraged the land rush, while Obama administration officials tried to stop what it called reckless drilling deals. After confronting fierce industry resistance and political realities, officials in Washington have eased back.
But in Vernal, a town that sits amid vast underground reserves of oil and gas as well as scenic treasures, critics say the bureau office under Mr. Stringer has taken a consistent stance all along: make way for drilling. ''Oil and gas trumps all else,'' said Dennis J. Willis, a retired agency employee.
Bureau officials deny any favoritism toward industry, while Mr. Stringer talks of balancing sometimes competing interests. ''Depending on who you are, where you stand, B.L.M. looks very different to you,'' he told industry executives last year. ''We move maybe from your hero to your villain.''
In the nine years that Mr. Stringer has been the top bureau official in Vernal, the field office has approved an average of 555 new oil and gas wells a year, nearly three times the number in the previous decade. Agency records show that his office, where employees often shuttle between business and government, rarely issues drilling-related fines for environmental or safety violations and has pushed to ease rules about well sites near sensitive wildlife habitats.
The agency in Utah also sided with business executives to kill a proposed agency study of the effect of thousands of oil and gas wells on area air quality. Mr. Stringer then helped push for an industry-controlled study instead, documents show, despite protests from Environmental Protection Agency officials.
''Achieved our goal of diverting B.L.M.,'' industry lobbyists wrote, praising Mr. Stringer. The study, released in 2009, turned out to be way off the mark, predicting no ''unacceptable effects on human health.'' By early 2010, air monitors near Vernal registered ozone levels among the worst in the United States, rivaling those of Los Angeles.
Local officials who view drilling as an economic boon frequently turn to Mr. Stringer as an ally when they run into roadblocks from Washington.
''Bill tries to find reasonable approaches to solve issues we encounter,'' said Mike McKee, a Uintah County commissioner. ''And that, to me, means Bill is a great guy.''
In recent months, the Obama administration has approved several long-delayed drilling projects near Vernal, including one that has brought threats of lawsuits from environmentalists and unusual praise from the industry. In an election year, with jobs a crucial issue and increasing energy independence a campaign talking point, President Obama and top officials are playing down their efforts to rein in the industry, instead sounding themes similar to Mr. Stringer's about approving more projects and expediting procedures.
''If you hear anybody on TV saying that somehow we're somehow against drilling for oil, then you'll know that they either don't know what they're talking about or they're not telling you the truth,'' Mr. Obama said in March, touring leased federal land in New Mexico. ''We're drilling all over the place.''
Anger at Government
Many in the standing-room-only crowd in the small convention center here one evening in May 2009 made clear their animosity toward federal officials from Washington, regardless of friendly feelings for Mr. Stringer. To them, the Interior Department had just issued a declaration of war.
The Obama administration had withdrawn gas and oil leases, issued in the final weeks of the Bush administration, on 103,000 acres in Utah, and David J. Hayes, a corporate environmental lawyer who was newly appointed as deputy Interior secretary, had come for a ''Community Listening Session.''
''You try to take that birthright away from us, we're going to have problems,'' Brownie Tomlinson, a contractor, warned Mr. Hayes. Later, he said, ''They control -- or at least think they do -- the whole bloody thing out there.''
Vernal, where almost everyone has ties to the oil and gas industries or knows someone who does, is an island of private property surrounded by a sea of federal and Indian land, part of territory that has been under federal control since the United States acquired it more than 150 years ago from Mexico. A colored map issued by the bureau highlights a startling fact: the federal government controls 47 percent of the land that makes up the 11 states west of Denver.
Resentment against the federal government is hardly new here. Every generation or so, tensions flare. The cancellation of the Utah leases in early 2009 was just the first of several Obama administration initiatives that aroused anger here. The Interior Department moved to all but terminate a Bush-era legal loophole that had allowed more than 30,000 new wells on federal lands without individual environmental reviews, including nearly half of those approved by Mr. Stringer's office through 2011. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar later announced a plan to protect wild lands in its inventory from any future drilling projects. ''The public lands were the central candy store where the oil industry walked in and took what it wanted,'' he said.
Oil and gas industry officials were furious. ''It's like we hit a brick wall,'' said Kathleen Sgamma, a lobbyist for the Western Energy Alliance, a Denver-based association that represents 400 oil and gas drillers, pointing to a drop in production in natural gas that has taken place on federal lands in Utah.
While industry officials saw Mr. Stringer, who has some latitude in implementing bureau policies, as an ally, they believed he would need help if they wanted their projects to advance. ''It is hard for him to move forward when he does not have support from Washington,'' Ms. Sgamma said.
Industry officials filed lawsuits and hired a growing army of help in Washington. Spending on lobbying surged by 60 percent during the Obama administration, reaching $150 million last year.
The score card shows that the industry is winning. Many of the administration's proposed new rules or eliminations of tax subsidies have been defeated, delayed or watered down in Congress. Lawmakers even prohibited the Interior Department from spending money on a measure to protect so-called wild lands from development.
Mr. Salazar, in an interview this month, said the administration had not changed course, and was still demanding that drilling on public lands be conducted in a ''smart from the start'' way. ''We don't believe it ought to be done anywhere and everywhere,'' he said.
Divided Mission
Inside the bureau's Vernal field office, the tensions over drilling on public lands are evident. Hard hats sit atop the cubicles occupied by the petroleum technicians, while decoys of wild ducks and other birds are displayed by the wildlife biologists.
It reflects a divide between employees dedicated to extracting the oil and gas from the ground and those assigned to protecting the land for generations to come. There is little question among the staff which camp Mr. Stringer is in.
He joined the bureau in 1981, not long after graduating from Colorado School of Mines with a degree in mining engineering. During his tenure in Utah, the number of oil and gas wells on federal land there -- most of them near Vernal -- has more than doubled, reaching just over 6,000 last year. Mr. Stringer's field office is now the busiest in the United States, getting more applications for drilling permits than any other.
''Grazing, wildlife, along with threatened and endangered species -- they commingle here,'' Mr. Stringer said in an interview, waving his hand across a map of northeastern Utah in his office. ''But oil and gas -- that's the major use.''
Some current and former staff members say that drilling permits and other industry requests are rarely rejected in Vernal. ''These companies could go into his office and get what they wanted -- he caters to the companies,'' said Paul Buhler, now an industry consultant who worked in the Vernal office for nearly 30 years. ''We want to make sure the community likes us. We live right here.''
The Vernal office recently approved a second project near Desolation Canyon, proposed by Gasco Energy, which includes 215 new wells on pristine land that environmentalists fought to protect from development. They have said they intend to challenge the project in court.
''One of the crown jewels of American wilderness landscape has been left on the cutting room floor,'' said Steve Bloch, a lawyer with the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance.
This spring, contractors were building a natural gas pipeline through nearby Nine Mile Canyon -- nicknamed the nation's longest art gallery -- where American Indians once pecked stick figures into sandstone walls.
The bureau defended the drilling, noting that the gas company is paying for archaeologists to help preserve the canyon's petroglyphs, but not everyone thinks that is adequate. Blaine Miller, a retired bureau archaeologist, warned that the dust, traffic and construction around the wells could damage the work, which is over 1,000 years old.
In a community where workers move between the Bureau of Land Management and oil and gas companies, an industry-friendly pattern of enforcement prevails. Officials from Washington acknowledge that the revolving door has created a shortage of inspectors, making it hard to keep up with work.
Although a local oil and gas company recently paid a record $2.1 million fine after an employee disabled gauges that would help determine the size of royalty payments to the government, bureau petroleum engineers in Vernal rarely issue fines to local companies for environmental and drilling violations. There were just 11 such penalties over the past dozen years in Utah, according to agency records and a recent Congressional report, with all the fines totaling $24,000: pocket change for companies that can spend millions on a single well.
Johnny P. Bowen, the supervising petroleum engineer technician in Vernal, said local energy companies were mostly responsible operators, and usually fixed problems after an oral warning.
Mr. Bowen once worked for industry in the area, as did his father, brother-in-law and father-in-law. The close community ties were evident one recent day when Donna L. Kenney, an inspector accompanying Mr. Bowen, ran into an oil company worker, Lee Slaugh, who is also a friend. Their conversation turned immediately to weekend plans.
''Sunday, what time?'' Ms. Kenney asked Mr. Slaugh, after he suggested that she and her family attend a semipro football game he would be coaching.
The most intense debate in Vernal has been over a natural resource that everyone uses: air.
Drilling equipment, as well as the trucks that supply the drilling gear, release pollutants, and methane gas often escapes when well sites are set up.
Near the end of the Bush administration, Larry Svoboda, then a Denver-based supervisor at the E.P.A., was alarmed at the pace of new drilling in Vernal and the potential for severe air pollution. But Mr. Stringer and other bureau officials in Utah seemed to ignore his warnings, he said.
Mr. Stringer was working with executives from the Western Energy Alliance to sell a plan for its own study. ''B.L.M. has adopted this strategy and Bill Stringer has been given responsibility for it,'' said a 2007 internal report by the alliance, which hailed ''our successful strategy to kill'' the government air quality report. (Confidential summaries of the meetings were accidentally posted on the Internet and obtained by The New York Times.)
A bureau spokesman said it was not Mr. Stringer's decision to kill the government study, which he had first proposed. Released in July 2009, the industry study concluded that the air in the region would be safe to breathe, even with the planned new drilling.
But by early 2010, air quality monitors began detecting a serious problem. On 40 days between January and March 2010, ozone levels exceeded the federal standard, some days creating a visible haze. In 2011, there were 24 bad ozone days during the winter. ''It was even worse than we had feared,'' said Mr. Svoboda, who retired last year. This year, a warm winter offered relief, but a new round of tests has been conducted to determine what might prevent ozone levels from becoming a major health hazard.
Bureau officials said that the industry-backed study was designed to predict summertime ozone problems, which are more typical, and that the study relied on science that was ''state of the art at the time.'' Industry executives appreciated Mr. Stringer's help; they advocated for a promotion for him in 2008 to ''keep Stringer going to bat for industry,'' according to the records.
Mr. Stringer says he is proud of his agency's efforts to combat air pollution, noting that gas companies are now being asked to take steps to reduce ozone-causing emissions.
''We have a good idea of the potential for conflict,'' he said about balancing industry ambitions and environmental concerns. ''Rather than just putting our heads down and trying to muscle forward and hope for the best, we are trying to work with all the parties.''
In Vernal, decisions by Mr. Stringer's office and officials in Washington are debated daily. Emily Hansen, 26, a teacher and mother of a 3-year-old, says that she and her father disagree about the harm the oil and gas boom poses.
''I am for drilling,'' Ms. Hansen said, adding that her husband's family owns an oil rig firm. ''But people do get so excited about the money; they overlook the environment. We all breathe the air here. They need to remember that.''

HEADLINE: When Your Pension Offers a Choice

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
WHEN I read about the General Motors retirees who were struggling to decide whether they should take a lump sum payout from the company or continue to receive a monthly check from an annuity, I knew immediately what I would do. I'd take the money and run.
Some of the lump sums mentioned in the article last week were in the seven figures, and that seemed like a lot to leave in an annuity. It wasn't that I worry about the health of Prudential Insurance, the company that G.M. is using to manage the annuity (though considering a company's long-term viability is crucial in the post-Lehman Brothers world). I just figured that I would rather control the money myself.
Of course, this was completely hypothetical for me. But it may not be such a simple issue for others. And while it is too late to advise the people at G.M., who had to make their decision last week, I figured there would be plenty of other people with company-run pensions who could face a similar choice as more and more companies seek to reduce their pension obligations. 
The basic choice itself -- between a set amount of money that has to last and a guaranteed payout for however long you live -- seemed almost like an experiment designed by a behavioral economist to test our irrationality about money decisions. So I turned first to Richard Thaler, professor of behavioral science and economics at the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago, to discuss the retirees' predicament. Mr. Thaler, after all, has spent a lot of time thinking about annuities and retirement savings.
''One of the mistakes is to think about this as a break-even proposition,'' Mr. Thaler said. ''How many years do I have to live for this to pay off? That's not a particularly helpful frame for this problem.''
He said it was reasonable for people to ask if they were healthier than average, at which point staying with the pension plan would make sense. And if they are particularly unhealthy, the lump sum is better. ''If you're 100 pounds overweight and a lifelong smoker, take the money,'' he said.
But he figured most people would be like him, generally healthy at 66. A better question for the retirees to ask, he said, is how comfortable they are in changing the way they think about money. People in defined-benefit plans assume that they will continue receiving a paycheck, as it were, in retirement. Taking the lump sum puts the burden on them to manage a windfall.
For those retirees who expressed concern about leaving money on the table if they died too young, Mr. Thaler said they should think about it in a different way: ''If I buy an annuity, I'm buying my children an insurance policy against me having to move in with them when I run out of money.''
Shlomo Benartzi, a business professor at the University of California, Los Angeles and the chief behavioral economist at Allianz Global Investors' Center for Behavioral Finance, said research had shown that most people were incapable of managing a lump sum of money well and that at least half of them got worse at it by the time they turned 80 and their mental faculties declined.
Mr. Benartzi said that for most General Motors retirees, the transfer of their pension to Prudential was preferable to it remaining at G.M. Prudential manages these risks as a business; G.M. makes cars.
''Because insurance companies are conservative, there is typically more money to pay the liability,'' he said. ''Would you rather trust an underfunded automobile manufacturer, or a well-funded insurance company that puts money aside to pay the liabilities?''
Still, the question of who opts in, or out, of the annuity is an equally big issue for Prudential. The company's risk calculations will be skewed if all the sick people take the lump sum and all the people who will live to 90 stay in the plan. For a group annuity like this to work, some people have to die young so there is enough money untapped for those who live longer than average.
Phil Waldeck, senior vice president for pension and structured solutions at Prudential, said this was the first time the company had taken over a pension where the participants had the choice of opting out. ''We have taken into account the potential longevity of the people we have and how the dynamics of the pool could change because of selection risk,'' he said.
Dave Roman, a spokesman for General Motors, would not say how many retirees opted for the lump sum, adding that the company may disclose more later in the year.
At least a few of the people I spoke to reached the same conclusion I did and said they would opt for the lump sum. Among them was Lyle K. Benson, a certified public accountant and president of L. K. Benson & Company, a wealth manager in Baltimore.
''I've always felt that I'd rather have control of my finances and invest it the way I wanted to,'' Mr. Benson said. ''I wouldn't feel comfortable with an annuity company investing it for me, and I'd like to have the ability to leave something to my heirs.''
He added, ''It's somewhat of a control issue but it's also being comfortable with that risk.''
But he said that when clients faced a similar choice, those who made their living in finance were more likely to take the lump sums. The others usually did not feel comfortable with the responsibility, he said.
(People taking the lump sum who are younger than 70 1/2 can roll it over into a retirement account and pay taxes when they withdraw the money.)
One advantage of investing the money on your own is that you can increase the value to keep pace with inflation. With the Prudential annuity, the monthly payment a retiree receives today will be the same amount three decades from now, when that money will buy less.
But Mr. Benartzi said research suggested that even if G.M. and Prudential had offered the option of inflation adjustment, few people would have taken it. ''If you told someone they could have $4,000 a month for life, or $3,000 a month now and it's going to go up, people just look at the salient numbers and say $4,000,'' he said. ''They don't think, 'That $3,000 is going to go up.' When you're making a plan for the next 20, 30, 40 years you have to factor inflation in.''
Of all the ideas I heard, two stood out for people who decide to go it alone.
Mr. Thaler said that one option for people truly concerned about outliving their money might be to take the lump sum payout and use some portion of it to buy a deferred annuity that does not start until, say, age 85. (Delaying taking Social Security, he pointed out, is also a cheap and easy way to increase the size of what is essentially an annuity.)
He would not, however, advise someone to buy an annuity with a guaranteed lump sum payment to your heirs if you died in the first five years. ''You're paying insurance over a period when you're not likely to die,'' he said.
Another option is to use some portion of the lump sum to buy an annuity and keep the rest in reserve for unexpected costs. Mr. Benartzi called this partial annuitization, where 75 percent of a person's retirement account, for instance, is put into an annuity, and the remaining 25 is invested.
''Having some liquidity is a good thing,'' he said. ''My only concern is when you let people take the lump sum and the annuity in whatever portions they want, they don't do it. They pick the annuity.''
While people with pensions may have to weigh these options if their companies change their plans, the rest of us, without pensions, will have to make do with whatever we have.

HEADLINE: In Sliding Internet Stocks, Some Hear Echo of 2000

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD and EVELYN M. RUSLI; David Streitfeld reported from San Francisco and Evelyn M. Rusli from New York.

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- Another couple of days like this and the great tech bubble of 2012 might recede into history.
Several companies that were supposed to be the foundation of a new Internet era plummeted this week as analysts and investors downgraded their dreams. There were instant echoes of the crash of 2000, when the money stopped flowing, the dot-coms crumbled and Silicon Valley devolved into recriminations and lawsuits.
Shares of Facebook stumbled to a new low Friday after its first earnings report revealed a murky path to any profit that would justify its lofty valuation. The heavily promoted $100 billion company on the eve of its May debut is now a $65 billion company and persistently headed south.
Zynga, the social games company that uses Facebook as a platform, was battered even worse on Thursday, leaving its value at less than a quarter of its peak last winter. Netflix, which is trying to move from physical discs to streaming video, and the coupon company Groupon have also been under severe pressure, leaving them at a fraction of their recent worth. 
Feelings of disillusionment are far from universal, and came even as The New York Times reported that Apple, the most successful tech company, had been discussing an investment in Twitter. Social media is flourishing; a billion Facebook and 500 million Twitter users would vouch for that. But as just about every Internet company is grappling with the transition to a mobile world, turning groups of people into cash-generating customers on a hand-held device is clearly an immense task.
Nick Zaharias, an independent consultant who advises institutional investors, said his clients were ''infinitely more skeptical.''
''For future deals that are pitched as social deals,'' he explained, ''they're not going to pay up. The multiples are going to be far, far lower.''
The issues facing each tumbling company are slightly different. But they all have the problem of selling something -- imaginary tractors, Internet films, discount deals or, in Facebook's case, someone ''liking'' a product -- that is not quite real and perhaps less than essential.
''The gleam has come off the word 'social,' '' said Ben Schachter, an Internet analyst with the Macquarie Group. ''The ground is now shifting underneath these companies' feet at a speed that we didn't see even in the late 1990s.''
Groupon and Netflix have been in the investor doghouse for a while, while with Facebook there seems simple regret that its grandest ambitions might not be reached (''The jury is in: Facebook is not and will not be a second Google,'' the research group IDC said).
With Zynga, however, there was a sudden sense that building a blue-chip business from virtual goods might be virtually impossible.
''Shocking,'' Mr. Schachter wrote in his report after Zynga revealed in its earnings report on Wednesday that it might make less than half of what it had hoped to earn this year from its more obsessive players who pay actual money for virtual goods like tractors -- its only real source of income. Increasingly, gamers want to play on the run, and Zynga's mobile games are not a runaway success.
For all the pain that stockholders of Zynga and the other companies must feel, it is not yet March 2000, when all tech stocks went into free fall. The old-line companies, including Google, Amazon and Apple, are doing fine.
But the questions about whether the chief executives and other early investors in some once-hot companies might have been a little too eager to cash in are already beginning, just as they did 12 years ago.
Early investors in Facebook increased their participation in the public offering at the last minute by more than 80 million shares, netting them nearly a billion dollars more than the shares would have fetched Friday on the open market. (Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's founder, was not among those increasing their allotment.) Zynga's founder, Mark Pincus, sold 16 million shares in an unusual secondary offering four months after the December public offering. He and other executives got $12 a share in those more optimistic times, four times the price on Friday.
Mr. Pincus was asked about those sales on Wednesday during the analyst conference call by the BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield. ''I wanted to see whether he felt bad about it,'' Mr. Greenfield said later. Mr. Pincus did not address the point.
If investors were battered and Wall Street was alarmed, Silicon Valley was unfazed.
The downward slide in public valuations would have an effect on private valuations, venture capitalists said, but it would be manageable.
Some of the biggest venture capital firms have raised giant funds in recent months. New Enterprise Associates announced this week, for instance, that it raised $2.6 billion for its latest fund -- the second largest in venture history. Valuations, particularly those at the later stage, have tightened a bit, but plenty of younger start-ups are still raising seed capital at lofty valuations.
''Venture capitalists tend to think long term,'' said Peter Barris, NEA managing general partner. ''The daily ups and downs in the stock market you've got to take with a grain of salt when you're looking at new investments and what they might be worth years from now.''
One blessing and one problem with investing in tech companies is that the pace of their development has increased. A start-up's initial sprint can be exciting, but it can also make it difficult to pinpoint when growth will start to decelerate. ''Companies can grow into their markets faster than ever before but that means they can reach saturation faster than ever before,'' said Roelof Botha, a partner at Sequoia Capital.
Two years ago, Sequoia was approached by secondary market shareholders who wanted to sell Facebook shares at a $25 billion valuation. Sequoia declined because it doesn't like being a passive shareholder and ''we asked ourselves if we could generate a really healthy return for our investors and we couldn't find the conviction,'' Mr. Botha said. One concern was the slowdown of Facebook user growth in developed markets. That worry resurfaced again this week.
In what has become a common refrain, many venture capitalists say Silicon Valley is rich with investment opportunities, because the world of 2012 is vastly different from the dot-com era. As the argument goes, it has never been easier to create a global start-up out of the box. The number of people connected to the Web is unprecedented. And so on.
In other words, the bubble will not pop, because this time it is different.
In an e-mail sent to founders last month, Paul Graham, the co-founder of Y Combinator, an influential start-up incubator, warned of possible headwinds. But Friday he said in effect not to worry -- at least not yet.
''It's too early to notice any effect on valuations,'' Mr. Graham said. ''Personally though, I have a lot of confidence in Facebook. I expect this is just a random fluctuation.''

HEADLINE: A Bus Ride to Show the Cracks in Immigration

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS

 BODY:
PHOENIX -- The route they will take on their cross-country trek resembles a slithering snake -- up, down and around in a series of intentional detours that are equal parts political strategy and provocation. Their bus leaves from this sprawling city in the desert at sunrise on Monday, carrying 30 men and women who say they have chosen to live in the shadows no more.
If all goes as planned, they will get to Charlotte, N.C., on Sept. 3, just as the Democratic National Convention is getting started. For the illegal immigrants taking the ride, it is time to make front and center a problem they feel President Obama has failed to confront. 
They do blame Congress and the Republicans for stonewalling attempts at immigration reform, but as one of the riders put it, ''they're not the only ones at fault.''
''No papers, no fear'' is their motto, and the words are stamped on T-shirts and posters that went on sale at a party here on Wednesday to raise money for food and water, lodging and toiletries, gas and rent of the bus, and also a bail fund. It is not as if anyone is looking to get arrested, but they are preparing for it.
The bus will traverse unfriendly territory for immigrants who are in the country illegally -- states like Georgia and Alabama, where the police are allowed to check the immigration status of certain people they detain.
It will cut across Louisiana and Mississippi, both of which tried -- and failed -- to enact legislation imposing penalties against illegal immigrants. It will slice through Tennessee, where in Davidson County, the sheriff boasts about his role helping federal authorities deport them.
They hope to expand on the activist role carved out by immigrants who were brought to the country as children, many of whom would be shielded from deportation under a policy enacted last month by the Obama administration. (Many of the riders on the bus are the parents of young people whose protests eventually spurred the administration's action.)
''I'm running this risk because I want us to be respected, I want us to be recognized as the human beings that we are,'' Maria Cruz Ramirez said at the party, where she sat before a makeshift stage, surrounded by other bus riders.
Ms. Ramirez, 46, said she came here 11 years ago from the Mexican state of Hidalgo to give her three children, whom she had brought along, a chance at a better life.
Gerardo Torres, 41, said he arrived here 18 years ago from the Mexican state of Aguascalientes so he could live freely as a gay man.
David Ramirez, 22, is among the youngest of the riders -- a green-eyed Mexican from the state of Durango who said he was brought to the United States when he was 9, too young to have made his own choice.
''I have a bachelor's degree in economics, for whatever it's worth,'' said Mr. Ramirez, who graduated in the spring from Dominican University, just outside Chicago, where he lives.
For them, the bus offers a chance for empowerment and kinship. The ride to North Carolina is scheduled to last six weeks, and Ms. Ramirez, who said she had never spent time away from her children, has forged a close friendship with Mr. Ramirez, who is almost as old as the oldest of her sons and is traveling on his own.
She said she had set aside the documents her family would need to run their lives and the household in case she does not make it back: Mexican birth certificates, bank account information, phone numbers of friends who can help them.
Mr. Torres said joining the ride forced him to come out to cousins, aunts and uncles who had no idea he is gay. ''I want to be the voice of the queer community,'' and the only way to do that is to embrace his homosexuality publicly, he said.
Mr. Ramirez said he had made no special plans.
''I'm walking on faith,'' he said.
As the party wrapped up, guests began to collect the chairs as actors from the New Carpa Theater dismantled the makeshift stage, set up in the auditorium of a labor union hall on 24th Street.
It had been a night of performances, like the short play featuring an encounter between Our Lady of Guadalupe, the patron saint of Mexico, and Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, known for his crackdowns on illegal immigrants. In it, Mr. Arpaio asked Guadalupe for her papers, while Guadalupe asked him to repent. He refused, and she left him to find his way out of the desert along the border, a place many Mexicans have died trying to cross.
''This Land Is Your Land'' played softly in the background.

HEADLINE: Legal Burdens Weigh On Barclays' Earnings

BYLINE: By MARK SCOTT

 BODY:
LONDON -- The problems continue to mount for Barclays, as the British bank disclosed that it was facing lawsuits related to a rate-rigging scandal and that regulators were investigating the company's financial director on a different matter.
The bank's legal and regulatory burdens have been a continued source of financial pain for Barclays. 
On Friday, Barclays reported that net profit dropped 76 percent to $752 million during the first six months of the year after taking an accounting charge on its debt and a charge for inappropriately selling complex financial products to small businesses. Last month, Barclays and other banks settled with British regulators over those sales, of interest rate swaps.
On Friday, Barclays said that the Financial Services Authority, the British regulator, was looking into the actions of some current and former employees, including the finance director, Chris Lucas, over the disclosure of fees related to the bank's capital-raising efforts in 2008. The issues revolve around agreements with the Qatar Investment Authority and the Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation of Japan, according to regulatory filings.
After the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, the British bank tapped Middle Eastern investors for a combined $:11.8 billion, or $18.6 billion, in two rounds of capital raising. Existing shareholders have voiced concerns that their rights were overlooked when Barclays turned to outside investors for a fresh injection of capital.
''Barclays considers that it satisfied its disclosure obligations and confirms that it will cooperate fully with the F.S.A.'s investigation,'' the bank said in a statement.
Last month, Barclays announced a $450 million settlement with American and British authorities over the manipulation of benchmark rates, including the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. On Friday, Barclays disclosed that it was facing class-action lawsuits in the United States related to such issues. One of the lawsuits also cites unnamed current and former members of the bank's board as defendants, according to a statement from the bank.
Barclays said it was ''not practical'' to estimate the costs related to the legal proceedings. Morgan Stanley analysts have said global banks may have to pay more than a combined $20 billion in penalties and fines related to the manipulation of Libor.
''We are sorry for the issues that have emerged over recent weeks and recognize that we have disappointed our customers and shareholders,'' Barclays' chairman, Marcus Agius, who will step down, said in a statement.
As it deals with the fallout, Barclays must also remake its management team. As the rate manipulation scandal unfolded, Robert E. Diamond Jr., the company's former chief executive, and Jerry del Missier, the former chief operating officer, both resigned. Mr. Agius said in a conference call that the firm would appoint a new chairman before selecting its next chief executive.
The bank is also taking a close look at its actions. Barclays has appointed Anthony Salz, vice chairman of the advisory firm Rothschild, to conduct a review into the British bank's business practices. Some current and former Barclays employees may still face criminal charges related to the rate-rigging scandal.
Despite the bad news, investors found a reason to be upbeat. By the close of trading in London, the bank's shares had jumped nearly 9 percent.
Without the accounting charge and other one-time costs, Barclays' net profit in the first half of the year rose 9 percent, to $:3.07 billion, compared with $:2.8 billion a year earlier. The earnings, which beat analysts' estimates, were driven by an improved performance in the bank's retail and corporate banking divisions.
Barclays' investment banking unit, however, continued to get hit by the European debt crisis. Other global rivals, like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, have faced weakness in their investment banking activity, but analysts said that Barclays had done better than most to maintain its trading income.
The bank reported a $:1 billion pretax profit in its investment banking unit in the three months through June 30, a 2.5 percent increase over the previous year. Barclays does not report net income for its separate business units.
''Despite the more recent regulatory assault, this underpins the belief that, in challenging conditions, Barclays Capital should continue to consolidate market share,'' Ian Gordon, a banking analyst at Investec in London, said in a note to investors.
The British bank said it had reduced its exposure to the debt of Southern European countries by 22 percent, to $:5.6 billion, during the first six months of the year. The bank's core Tier 1 ratio, a measure of ability to weather financial shocks, fell slightly to 10.9 percent.
''We continue to be cautious about the environment in which we operate and will maintain the group's strong capital, leverage and liquidity positions,'' Mr. Lucas of Barclays said in a statement.

HEADLINE: Deficit Prediction Trimmed For the Rest of the Decade

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The federal budget deficit will be slightly lower for fiscal year 2012 and for the rest of the decade than projected earlier this year, the Obama administration said Friday. Its required midyear update on the nation's fiscal health showed that while revenues are coming in lower than projected -- a consequence of a slowed economy -- federal spending has been lower as well. 
For the fourth year since the financial crisis of 2008, the deficit will exceed $1 trillion, at $1.2 trillion for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, according to the president's Office of Management and Budget. That is $116 billion lower than the $1.3 trillion deficit that the administration forecast in February in President Obama's annual budget.
The new figure equals 7.8 percent of the size of the economy, down from the February projection of a deficit equivalent to 8.5 percent of the gross domestic product. Economists generally say deficits should not exceed 3 percent of gross domestic product in a country with a stable economy, and the administration continues to project that the deficit will fall to just below that level by 2017, and remain there through the decade.
In the decade from fiscal years 2013 to 2022, total deficits will be $240 billion lower than projected in February, according to the budget office.
Such reductions would have been heralded as significant not many years ago. But in the post-crisis context of annual trillion-dollar deficits, those amounts are widely seen as woefully insufficient for addressing the country's budgetary imbalance. By all accounts, the next few years of declining deficits will be followed by years in which deficits will send the overall debt to unsustainable heights as the large baby boom generation ages, qualifying for ever-costlier medical benefits.
The lowered deficit projection for this year reflects budget analysts' forecast, based on economic and technical factors, that revenues will be $27 billion less than expected but that spending will be $143 billion less, for a net deficit reduction of $116 billion.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office separately will release its budget update in August.
Republicans in Congress pounced on the report to attack Mr. Obama's fiscal record. With an eye to the elections, Representative Paul D. Ryan, a Republican of Wisconsin who is chairman of the House Budget Committee, said, ''We can no longer afford a president and a U.S. Senate that refuse to get serious about tackling our generation's defining challenge.''
Yet under Mr. Ryan's budget plan, annual deficits would persist for decades because his proposed tax cuts would offset deep spending cuts.
Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota, who is chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said: ''The solution must include a comprehensive and balanced long-term deficit reduction plan. That can only happen if both sides agree to move off their fixed positions. Republicans must yield on revenues, and Democrats must agree to entitlement changes. And it is important that the agreed upon plan be phased in carefully so that the changes don't worsen the fragile economic recovery.''

HEADLINE: New Revisions Weaken Senate Cybersecurity Bill

BYLINE: By MICHAEL S. SCHMIDT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Despite warnings of a potentially crippling cyberattack, a group of lawmakers led by Senator John McCain has successfully weakened bipartisan legislation that the Obama administration said was crucial to protecting computer systems responsible for operating the nation's critical infrastructure.
Strong opposition from Mr. McCain, Republican of Arizona, and others on behalf of the business community forced Democratic and Republican supporters of the legislation to drop provisions that would have given the federal government the power to enforce minimum standards on systems that run power plants, air traffic control systems, dams and similar facilities. 
The Senate will debate the measure next week, even though the changes have raised new questions about its effectiveness.
''The key to successfully fighting this threat is not adding more bureaucrats or forcing industries to comply with government red tape,'' Mr. McCain said Friday in a statement that announced that he and seven other Republican senators had introduced their own bill that calls for more information sharing among companies. ''Instead, we must leverage the ingenuity and innovation of the private sector in partnership with the most effective elements of the federal government to address this emerging threat.''
Original versions of the bill, which was first drafted in 2009, called for giving the Department of Homeland Security the power to enforce minimum cybersecurity standards on infrastructure computer systems that, if damaged, would lead to mass casualties or economic loss.
But the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other business lobbyists strongly objected, saying that such regulations would create a costly and cumbersome process.
The measure now before the Senate makes the minimum standards optional, dealing a significant setback to the administration, which had made legislation to safeguard computer systems a top national security priority this year. In April, the House passed its own version of the cybersecurity bill that encourages businesses and intelligence agencies to share information about attacks and threats to computer systems. Senate backers of the measure say their hope now is to pass the legislation and get into talks with the House. Even more attempts to change the Senate measure are expected.
James A. Lewis, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a cybersecurity expert, said the revised Senate measure did not provide any new powers to the federal government to protect computer systems of critical infrastructure.
''If it is passed, nobody will notice it,'' he said. ''You can do everything in the bill with an executive order.''
Dr. Lewis added: ''The same way you wouldn't say that we don't need the F.A.A. because we can rely on incentives and a voluntary approach, we can't rely on incentives and voluntary action for cybersecurity. Every day the risk gets bigger, it is not only countries but politically motivated individuals who can just download this stuff. A lot of us hoped Congress would have done better than this.''
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the independent from Connecticut who sponsored the measure as chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, and the committee's ranking member, Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said Friday that they were caught off guard by the determined opposition of Mr. McCain, who has for years made national security issues his priority.
''He knows that I'm disappointed,'' Mr. Lieberman said, referring to Mr. McCain, one of his closest allies and friends in the Senate. ''His natural side, based on his whole history, is to do the best thing for security and not to be worried about other factors.''
Tension between Mr. Lieberman and Mr. McCain bubbled to the surface on Wednesday at a closed-door meeting of senators and staff members about the legislation in the office of Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said Congressional aides who attended the meeting and discussed the deliberations on the grounds that they would not be quoted by name.
The staff members said Mr. Lieberman openly questioned Mr. McCain about why he was putting the interests of the Chamber of Commerce over national security and asked Mr. McCain what he would say if he blocked the bill and the nation suffered a catastrophic cyberattack.
Mr. McCain, the staff members said, became visibly angry and shouted back at Mr. Lieberman, saying that his reputation on national security issues was unquestionable.
In a telephone interview, Mr. Lieberman acknowledged that he had had a disagreement with Mr. McCain at the meeting but declined to discuss the specifics.
''You'll have the most emotional arguments with the people you are closest to, and we are good friends and neither of us can conceal the fact that we don't agree on this issue,'' Mr. Lieberman said. ''We agree on a lot of things, and whenever we disagree, he's wrong.''
A spokesman for Mr. McCain did not return messages seeking comment.
The White House has worked for much of the year to persuade members of Congress to pass cybersecurity legislation that would require minimum standards for computers at critical infrastructure facilities where a breach would cause significant damage.
In March, high-ranking administration officials -- including Janet Napolitano, secretary of the Homeland Security Department; Robert S. Mueller III, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation; and Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff -- provided a closed-door demonstration to roughly four dozen senators on what could happen if a cyberattack derailed the New York City electrical grid on a hot summer day. In an effort to underscore the seriousness of the threat, General Dempsey told the senators that he was so concerned about a cyberattack that he had skipped a meeting of the National Security Council on Iran to attend the briefing. The briefings gave new urgency to the legislation, which for years has been the subject of talks among senior lawmakers who include Senators Collins and Lieberman as well as Senator John D. Rockefeller, the West Virginia Democrat who is chairman of the Commerce Committee.
Ms. Collins said that while many high-ranking administration officials had been involved in lobbying members of Congress to pass the bill, she was disappointed that President Obama had not been more personally involved in raising awareness.
''Other than writing an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal and a call to both Joe Lieberman and me a couple of months ago, the president has been largely absent from the debate,'' she said.
Ms. Collins said there might have been a different outcome for the bill ''if the president had been more active when we were under assault.''
A White House spokeswoman declined to comment.

HEADLINE: Land Of the Mega-Voters

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
Minot, N.D.
''No! No! No!'' cried Heidi Heitkamp. She's the Democratic senatorial candidate in North Dakota. I had just asked her whether residents of her state think it's unfair that, in the Senate, each North Dakota voter has the clout of approximately 50 Californians.
She doesn't. 
That was the top thing I had always wondered about the politics of North Dakota, whose two U.S. senators serve a population of around 680,000. (Campaign-wise, it resembles the Iowa caucuses. Voters expect to have met the candidates personally. Sometimes they seem to expect the candidates to invite them home for dinner.)
I was wandering around the state this week, mulling its Senate race. Really, we can't possibly focus on Barack Obama and Mitt Romney for another three months without an occasional reprieve.
So, North Dakota. Heitkamp, a former attorney general, is running against Representative Rick Berg, the state's sole member of the House. In the beginning, the national Democrats wrote this one off as a long shot at best, but Heitkamp seems to have, at minimum, pulled even. On the campaign trail, she's a happy warrior with the endless energy you'd need if you were running for office in a state where there's a two-hour drive between even the smaller clumps of voters. She also has a dramatic story that centers on the year 2000, when she ran for governor and was diagnosed with Stage 3 breast cancer, but she stayed in the race, campaigning even while she had chemotherapy and her trademark red hair fell out. She lost but seems to have made an indelible imprint on the public.
(The other happy Senate surprise for the Democrats is Arizona, where the party somehow came up with a Hispanic physician who is a disabled Vietnam veteran and former surgeon general for the Bush administration, as well as the hero of several dramatic rescues, during one of which he shot a deranged suspected murderer. I believe I speak for all the political hopefuls in America when I say that the bar for a potential upset win is being set unacceptably high.)
As soon as the North Dakota Senate race began, Republican super PACs began beating Heitkamp with the health care mallet. ''Heidi endorsed Obamacare,'' says one much-aired ad that features a very brief tape of Heitkamp saying, with no apparent enthusiasm, ''It actually is a budget saver.'' In response, she almost always brings the discussion back to her own story. Her next ad began with Heitkamp discussing her bout with cancer and adding, ''When you live through that, political attack ads seem silly.''
''I have a pretty well-known pre-existing condition,'' she says dryly.
My second big North Dakota question was why, if the voters were really obsessed about the economy and jobs, jobs, jobs, the state wasn't tilting toward Obama. True, North Dakota hasn't gone for a Democratic presidential candidate since Lyndon Johnson. But things are great! The unemployment rate is around 3 percent and close to zero in the areas around the booming oil industry. The farmers weren't hit by the drought, and their crops are going to be worth a fortune at harvest time.
Much of this good news occurred on the president's watch. Does he get credit? The answer, once again, is no, no, no.
''If Heidi is elected, I won't lose sleep. She'll do a great job,'' said E. Ward Koeser, the mayor of the oil-boom town of Williston, a Republican who has endorsed Berg. ''If Barack Obama gets elected, I'll lose sleep.''
''Leadership means you take people who are polarized and get them together. I don't think he was that good at building relations,'' said Heitkamp, trying to explain her state's antipathy toward Obama. ''When people are mad at me, I always try to stand next to them for 20 minutes. They can't stay mad.''
We will not try to envision the president using that tactic on John Boehner. But Heitkamp says she'll be voting for Obama in November -- because Mitt Romney supports the House Republican budget.
''People ask me why, and I point to that budget,'' she says.
In 2010, North Dakota voters were furious about the national debt and the horrors they'd heard about Obamacare, and they tossed out virtually every Democratic incumbent they could get their hands on. Now Heitkamp is betting that the House budget, with its Medicare restructuring and dramatic program cuts will seem even more radical to the emotionally conservative North Dakotans than the stimulus or health care law. ''There's $180 billion in farm cuts in there,'' she said, launching into a litany of government aid it would strip away from North Dakota.
Berg says the House budget is thrifty and represents the ''North Dakota way of doing things.'' We shall see. It's up to the North Dakota voters. A very small number of North Dakota voters.
Eat your heart out, California.

HEADLINE: Behind EBay's Comeback

BYLINE: By JAMES B. STEWART

 BODY:
Remember Myspace, Friendster, eToys, Webvan, Urban Fetch, Pets.com? Like meteors, they burned with dazzling brilliance before turning shareholder dollars to ash. EBay, Yahoo and AOL, the dominant Internet triumvirate circa 2004, seemed destined for a similar fate. The conventional wisdom has been that once decline sets in at an Internet company, it's irreversible.
But that was before eBay's latest earnings surprise, which sent its stock soaring and had analysts scrambling to raise their projections. ''Can Internet companies ever turn around? The answer has been no,'' Ken Sena, Internet analyst at Evercore, told me this week. ''But now, there's eBay. The answer may turn out to be yes.''
If so, eBay's success has big implications for struggling companies like Yahoo and AOL, not to mention more recent sensations that have already lost some luster, like Zynga, Groupon and even Facebook, whose shares tumbled this week after its first earnings report as a public company disappointed investors. ''EBay has demonstrated that it's possible to turn the corner even against long odds,'' said David Spitz, president and chief operating officer of ChannelAdvisor, an e-commerce consulting company. 
EBay shares hit a peak of over $58 in 2004 and made its chief executive, Meg Whitman, a Silicon Valley celebrity. But by November 2007, when she stepped down to enter politics, the telltale signs of decline had set in. Its stock was slumping. Its dominant online auction business had matured, and growth had slowed. Sellers complained about higher fees and poor support. That year, eBay wrote off $1.4 billion on its poorly conceived $2.5 billion acquisition of the calling service Skype, recording its first loss as a public company. Analysts worried that eBay had lost its quirky soul, and was abandoning the flea market auction model that had made it distinctive and dominant in online auctions. By early 2009, its stock was barely over $10, down over 80 percent from its peak.
Ms. Whitman was succeeded by a former Bain & Company managing director, John Donahoe. ''One of the unique things about the Internet is a company can be a white-hot success and become a global brand and reach global scale in just a few years -- that's the good news,'' he told me this week. ''But then somebody can turn around and do it to you. There's constant disruption. One of the first things I had to do here was face reality. EBay was getting disrupted.''
Little more than four years after taking charge, a buoyant Mr. Donahoe sounded like the chief executive of a surging start-up when he announced eBay's latest results on July 18. So thoroughly has eBay been transformed that he didn't even mention its traditional auction business. ''Our multiyear effort is paying off,'' he said. Profit more than doubled and revenue jumped 23 percent. ''EBay is revitalized. We believe the best is yet to come.'' In a stock market struggling with recession fears and the European debt crisis, eBay stock this week hit a six-year high.
How has eBay done it when so many others have failed?
Excitement about eBay's prospects has little to do with its traditional auction business, or even its core e-commerce operations, although its marketplace division posted solid results and had its best quarter since 2006, the company said. Most of its growth came from mobile retailing and its PayPal online payments division, a business it acquired in 2002 for what now looks like a bargain $1.5 billion.
As consumers embrace shopping on their smartphones, ''mobile continues to be a game-changer,'' Mr. Donahoe said. He noted that 90 million users had downloaded eBay's mobile app and that 600,000 customers made their first mobile purchase during the most recent quarter. ''A woman's handbag is purchased on eBay mobile every 30 seconds,'' he said. ''Mobile is revolutionizing how people shop and pay.''
''It's hard to think of many companies that benefit from mobile,'' Mr. Sena said. ''Usually it means more competition. But clearly, eBay is one of them. EBay is offering a one-click payment solution. You don't have to type in a credit card number or PIN. It's just one click on your mobile phone.''
Mr. Spitz said he was recently stopped at a traffic light and the sun was bothering his eyes. By the time the light turned green, he had used his phone to order and pay for sunglasses. ''This is what commerce anytime, anywhere means,'' he said. ''It's here.''
Mr. Donahoe deserves credit not only for recognizing that smartphones would change the shopping experience, but for acting on it, Mr. Spitz said. ''EBay under Mr. Donahoe pivoted hard in this direction,'' he said.
Mr. Donahoe confirms that, saying: ''We saw the mobile revolution early and we made a big bet across the entire company. We saw that mobile was an important factor for our customers. It was becoming the central control device in their lives. We didn't worry if it cannibalized our existing business, because we knew it was what our customers wanted.''
The smartphone ''has blurred the line between e-commerce and off-line retail,'' Mr. Donahoe continued. ''Four years ago, you had to be in front of a laptop or desktop to shop online. Now you can do it seven days, 24 hours. We're going to have to drop the 'e' from e-commerce.''
Retailers have warmed to the new eBay. ''They're a great partner,'' Gerald L. Storch, chairman and chief executive of Toys ''R'' Us, told me this week. ''In an omni-channel retail world, mobile, social, Internet, physical stores -- they're all linked. Customers want to interact with our brand at every level. EBay is especially strong in mobile and payment systems, but they address all those areas and help us compete. We do everything with them.''
Amazon was supposed to have crushed eBay by now with its bigger scale and state-of-the-art inventory and delivery systems. That didn't happen, but Amazon remains eBay's biggest competitive threat. Amazon continues to invest in its delivery systems and it, too, has an effective mobile app and one-click payment system.
Even so, many analysts see plenty of room for both Amazon and eBay, and perhaps even more competitors. ''When you look at e-commerce as a share of overall consumer spending, it's not even 10 percent worldwide,'' Mr. Spitz said. ''There's plenty of room for growth.''
Mr. Donahoe agreed. ''We've never viewed the world as a zero-sum game with Amazon,'' he said. ''There's plenty of room for multiple winners.''
Moreover, eBay is likely to benefit from its global reach and scale as e-commerce expands. ''Consumers aren't going to download 30 apps from individual retailers, but they will download both eBay and Amazon,'' Mr. Spitz said. EBay and PayPal apps already rank among the top 10 mobile apps, eBay said.
And it's obviously in retailers' interests to prevent Amazon from becoming an e-commerce monopoly. EBay stresses, without mentioning Amazon by name, that it doesn't compete with its retail customers. Some sellers have complained that when Amazon spots a hot product, it starts promoting and selling it itself at lower prices.
As Mr. Storch put it: ''We do sell Kindle Fires and other Amazon products, but when it comes to retail, eBay helps us succeed. Amazon is the competition.''
The dynamics of e-commerce aside, several broad themes emerge from eBay's turnaround:
EBay had to break with its past and seize new opportunities. ''It was clear the world had innovated around eBay and eBay had stayed with the same formula,'' Mr. Donahoe said. ''Saying that was considered heresy. With any company that's been this successful, there's enormous momentum to keep doing what you've been doing and hope the world will go back to what it used to be.''
At the same time, EBay didn't entirely abandon its roots -- it's still an e-commerce company. But ''we had to make changes that were unpopular with subsets of our customers and other people. You have to have the conviction to do what you know is right,'' Mr. Donahoe said. ''We spent three years fixing the fundamentals and tried not to worry about what everyone else was saying.''
Technological innovation is critical. ''We stepped on the gas with innovation,'' Mr. Donahoe said. ''We're more technology- and innovation-driven than we've ever been. Mobile gave us the opportunity to start with a clean slate from a technology perspective.'' Less than two years ago, eBay acquired Critical Path Software, which was helping to develop eBay's mobile apps. ''We thought they were the best, so we bought them and got a couple hundred of the best software developers in the world working exclusively for us,'' Mr. Donahoe said.
The resulting mobile apps have been hugely successful with customers. ''They're a nice, clean, elegant solution, a very pleasant experience,'' Mr. Spitz said. ''Many people are encountering eBay on a mobile device and coming away with a great first impression.''
New products are in the pipeline. Mr. Donahoe said PayPal Here, a new payment system, would allow customers to ''check in'' in advance at a shop, be greeted by name when they arrive, complete transactions without a mobile device or credit card and get a text message as a receipt.
Management change is necessary and inevitable. Mr. Donahoe has been chief for just over four years, and has replaced most of eBay's top management. ''A significant change in senior leadership was necessary to take eBay to the next level,'' he said. He built a team of managers who shared his dedication ''to building a great and enduring company, a company that will last,'' as he put it. ''No one else has really done that on the Internet, and we're excited by the possibility.'' At the same time, he said, ''We can't take anything for granted. We're almost paranoid. We get up every morning and we're focused on delivering for our customers and continuing to innovate. It's a fast-changing world.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Growth Falls to 1.5%; A Recovery Seems Mired

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN; Binyamin Appelbaum contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The United States economy has lost the momentum it appeared to be building earlier this year, as the latest government statistics showed that it expanded by a mere 1.5 percent annual rate in the second quarter.
The mired recovery makes the United States more vulnerable to trouble in Europe and, at home, the potential expiration of several tax breaks and other buoyant measures at the end of the year, known as the fiscal cliff. It also illustrates the election-season challenge to President Obama, who must sell his economic record to voters as the recovery slows.
Growth, as measured by the gross domestic product, lagged as consumers curbed new spending and businesses held back. Several bright spots in the first three months of the year, including auto production, computer sales and large purchases like appliances and televisions, dimmed or faded away altogether in the second quarter, and government at all levels continued to cut spending. Growth was not strong enough to drive down the unemployment rate, which has stalled above 8 percent in recent months. 
The lackluster figure immediately gave Mr. Obama's opponents the opportunity to question the federal government's response to the financial crisis, though a vast majority of economists agree that the stimulus and the bank bailouts saved jobs. House Speaker John Boehner said the G.D.P. report, released Friday by the Commerce Department, showed ''the need to stop all of the looming tax hikes.'' The report also spurred calls from liberals for the government to do more.
The Federal Reserve, which has lowered its forecasts in recent weeks, is watching the slowdown carefully as it considers further stimulus, though several analysts said Friday that they doubted that new action from the Fed could have much effect.
''Given where interest rates are, I think it should be evident that we're in one of those spots where in order to lift growth, government needs to spend money,'' said Steve Blitz, the chief economist at ITG Investment Research.
The economy is following a pattern established over several years now -- hopes raised by modest acceleration that later fizzles out -- that underscores the notion that rebounds after financial busts take their own excruciating time.
This year, some of the weakening was to be expected after a spurt of activity during an unseasonably warm winter. A mild uptick is expected in the second half of the year, driven in part by lower gas prices.
But improvement strong enough to provide real traction or lower the jobless rate remains out of reach. While the economy has not entered a downward spiral in which weakness feeds on itself, wrote Jim O'Sullivan, the chief United States economist for High Frequency Economics, an analysis firm, ''there does not appear to be much basis for expecting a significant pickup any time soon.''
The government also provided on Friday a revised figure for first-quarter G.D.P., saying the economy then grew by a 2 percent annual rate. The previous estimate was 1.9 percent.
A slowdown in household spending is still hampering economic growth. Consumers increased their savings rate, a sign of increased uncertainty about the future. Governments also continued to cut spending. Exports accelerated in the second quarter despite more recent signs of diminishing demand, but the gain was canceled out by a larger increase in imports, which count against the gross domestic product. Economists expect exports to shrink as the dollar rises against other currencies, making American goods less competitive.
The housing sector, which has gone from a drag on the economy to a positive, continued to grow, posting a 9.7 percent gain -- though again, that is less than half its rate of growth in the first quarter.
Uncertainty cast a pall, coming from both the domestic front, with a presidential race and the fate of numerous federal policies in question, and from overseas, with companies like Ford reporting a decline in profit this week because of the slowdown in Europe, despite a healthy showing in North America.
''You can't blame all of it on Europe -- we have our own problems yet,'' said Joshua Shapiro, the chief United States economist at MFR Inc., a financial consulting firm. ''When you have a credit bubble or asset bubble that's popped, the recovery process from that is just really long and really painful.''
Inflation, a measure watched closely by the Federal Reserve as it determines whether to take further action, slowed as well, with consumer prices growing only 0.7 percent compared with 2.5 percent in the first quarter.
At Marble King, a small manufacturer in West Virginia that supplies retail distributors and manufacturers, an increase in orders in the first few months of the year leveled off in the second quarter, said Beri Fox, the owner and chief executive. ''I have not seen continued growth, but it didn't go back down,'' Ms. Fox said. ''That doesn't mean that in the fall orders, we aren't going to see a decline because they may be overstocked from what they ordered over the summer.''
The Commerce Department also released updated estimates of economic activity for 2009, 2010 and 2011. Those figures showed that the recession was less severe than it seemed in the most recent reports, though more pronounced than in initial readings. As a consequence, that the pace of recovery also appears somewhat slower.
The new estimates show that economic activity fell by 3.1 percent in 2009 and then rose by 2.4 percent in 2010. Last summer, the government reported that activity fell by 3.5 percent in 2009 before rising 3 percent in 2010. The estimated pace of growth in 2011, 1.8 percent, remained basically unchanged. It was previously reported as 1.7 percent.
The revisions, part of an annual process, reflect the imprecise nature of the agency's work. Its initial estimates are derived from a mix of comprehensive data, samples and educated guesswork, and are refined over time. In this case, officials said they had significantly underestimated spending by state and local governments in 2009, and overestimated corporate profits and purchases in 2010.
The agency now estimates average annual growth of 0.3 percent over the three-year period, rather than 0.4 percent.
But the new numbers may modify public perception of two crucial economic trends. It appears that corporations rebounded more slowly from the recession than previously believed. And the more complete data used in the new estimates show that state and local governments increased spending in 2009 before cutting back in the next two years. Officials said they did not have enough information to explain the previously unreported increase, except to say the money was not spent on personnel or on infrastructure projects, the two categories that might have benefited most directly from the federal government's stimulus programs.
Alan Krueger, the president's top economic adviser, wrote in a White House blog post that the increase was ''consistent with the Recovery Act cushioning the effect of the recession and helping to launch the recovery.''

HEADLINE: Market Up as European Central Bank Hints at Action

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average surpassed 13,000 on Friday, while Treasuries fell and commodities gained on speculation that the European Central Bank would purchase bonds to help lower borrowing costs and ease the debt crisis.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 1.46 percent, or 187.73 points, to 13,075.66, the biggest two-day jump since December. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.91 percent, or 25.95 points, to 1,385.97. The Nasdaq gained 2.24 percent, or 64.84 points, to 2,958.09.
The market rally eased demand for the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, sending it down 31/32 to 101 28/32. Its yield rose to 1.55 percent from 1.44 percent. 
The euro appreciated 0.09 percent to $1.2298. A measure of the United States's corporate debt risk dropped for a third day.
Stocks extended their gains after two central bank officials said the bank's president, Mario Draghi, would hold talks with the Bundesbank president, Jens Weidmann, in an effort to overcome the biggest stumbling block to a new raft of measures including bond purchases. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Francois Hollande of France said that their countries were ''bound by the deepest duty'' to keep the euro zone intact and that they would do ''everything'' necessary to protect the single currency.
''Any E.C.B. actions to buy bonds extend the lifeline to the region as the political leaders grapple for other solutions,'' John Augustine, chief market strategist at Cincinnati-based Fifth Third Bancorp, said in a phone interview. ''This is what the market is focused on.''
''The realization became for the market that if we are going this route of another round of massive bond buying, that is going to have some pretty severe implications for the E.C.B.'s balance sheet,'' Shaun Osborne, chief currency strategist at Toronto-Dominion Bank's TD Securities unit, said in a phone interview.
Spanish and Italian bonds surged for a third day as Italy's 10-year yield fell below 6 percent for the first time in a week. Spain's 10-year yield fell 18 basis points to 6.74 percent.
''There is a little bit more optimism about a plan coming together from European policy makers,'' said Michael Cloherty, head of United States interest rate strategy in New York at RBC Capital Markets unit, one of 21 primary dealers that trade directly with the Federal Reserve.
The S.& P. 500 rose 1.71 percent this week and closed Friday at its highest level since May. The Dow average was up 1.97 percent for the week.
In the United States, data showed that the economy expanded more slowly in the second quarter as a softening job market prompted Americans to curb spending. Consumer confidence in July dropped to the lowest level this year.
Merck added 4.07 percent and Amgen added 5.83 percent after their earnings beat estimates. Expedia, the online travel company, surged 20.11 percent after raising its dividend.
Facebook tumbled 11.7 percent after reporting slower sales growth and narrower profit margins. Starbucks fell 9.42 percent after forecasting fourth-quarter profit that missed estimates.
Oil rose for a fourth day, climbing 74 cents to $90.13 a barrel in New York. Gold rose by $2.90, to $1,618.00 an ounce.

HEADLINE: As Facebook and Zynga Drop, Some See a Shift in Silicon Valley

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: Tech companies that were thought to be the foundation of a new Internet era declined this week. For some, it feels like a shift in Silicon Valley. 

 BODY:
Another couple of days like this and the great tech bubble of 2012 might recede into history, write David Streitfeld and Evelyn M. Rusli of The New York Times. Several companies that were supposed to be the foundation of a new Internet era plummeted this week as analysts and investors downgraded their dreams. There were instant echoes of the crash of 2000, when the money stopped flowing, the dot-coms crumbled and Silicon Valley devolved into recriminations and lawsuits. Read more

HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times, plus a look at the president's weekly address and the latest happenings in Washington. 

 BODY:
Today's Times

        
Despite warnings of a potentially crippling cyberattack, a group of lawmakers led by Senator John McCain has successfully weakened bipartisan legislation that the White House said was crucial to protecting computer systems responsible for much of the nation's critical infrastructure, Michael S. Schmidt reports. The changes have raised new questions about the legislation's effectiveness, but Mr. McCain says that forcing industries to comply with "government red tape" is not the answer to fighting threats.

        
Complications with Mitt Romney's weekend schedule in Israel are examples of the challenges politicians face whenever American and Israeli politics intersect, Jodi Rudoren and Ashley Parker report. The trip is a critical opportunity to show statesmanship and to highlight Mr. Romney's relationship with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, but the timing has turned out to be both auspicious and fraught.

        
Throughout the election cycle, Mitt Romney's team hastried to build a low-risk campaign, resulting in an operation that is often scrambling to catch up rather than making its own news and controlling the narrative, Ashley Parker writes.
Though revenues have fallen, federal spending has been reduced as well, leading to a projected deficit of $1.2 trillion in fiscal year 2012 rather than $1.3 trillion, Jackie Calmes reports. While such reductions would have been heralded as significant not many years ago, in the post-recession era the amounts are widely seen as woefully insufficient for addressing the country's budgetary imbalance.

        
President Obama used his weekly address to discuss a proposed extension on middle-class tax cuts, saying that "everyone in Washington says they agree on this." The Senate has passed legislation already, but he says that Republicans in the House are holding the tax cuts hostage until there is an extension for wealthy Americans as well. "You see, Republicans in Congress and their nominee for president believe that the best way to create prosperity in America is to let it trickle down from the top," he said. "They're wrong. And I know they're wrong because we already tried it that way for most of the last decade. It didn't work."

HEADLINE: Can Universities Credibly Probe Gas Impacts When Industry Foots the Bill?

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: A foe of fracking sees big problems if hidden conflicts of interest in energy analysis become the norm. 

 BODY:
July 29, 4:38 p.m. | Updated (see asterisk) |
Lisa Wright, a foe of natural gas drilling using hydraulic fracturing, or facking, sent the following essay reflecting on recent posts about apparent undisclosed conflicts of interest in a University of Texas gas drilling study and an unrefereed study claiming a link between drilling and fetal health. Her piece is cogent and constructive and worthy of being featured as a "Your Dot" contribution. Wright, who recently moved to a suburb of Washington, D.C., is a native of upstate New York (and songwriter) who says she spent much of the last four years there volunteering with anti-drilling groups. Here's her piece asks if COI (conflicts of interest) have become the new BAU (business as usual). (I think the quality of energy analysis derives from data and methods, not who pays the bills. But I agree with Wright that new standards for disclosure are clearly needed.)
Here's her piece:
The United States is now well on its way to a renewables-crushing, decades-long shale-gas bridge with an economic commitment to exporting this non-renewable domestic fuel and, absent dramatic market changes, there's not much Congressman Markey or anyone else can do to stop it. Given that this gas rush has been lent credibility by some sectors of academia, it is good that you bring up the topic of potential conflicts of interest in academia related to the issues surrounding shale gas.
There is a growing list of universities with apparent conflicts that have put their names on studies promoting gas -- studies that have been used to sway elected officials and U.S. energy policy -- but no one outside of the blogosphere has seemed to care.
It was pretty clear from the outset that the University of Texas report "Fact-Based Regulation for Environmental Protection in Shale Gas Development" would be widely quoted and used as a political tool, which it has been. As early as last November, news articles echoed preliminary findings of the study suggesting "no direct link to reports of groundwater contamination."
Environmental Defense Fund's senior policy adviser Scott Anderson gave an approving nod, and no questions of conflicts were broached in his blog despite EDF's involvement with the study. Interestingly, "Scott spent many years in the oil and gas industry prior to joining Environmental Defense Fund." *
Similarly, not many folks seemed to care that John Deutch, the chairman of Secretary of Energy Steven Chu's Natural Gas Subcommittee, is a compensated director at Cheniere, the liquefied natural gas corporation, while supposedly maintaining an amazing ability to have helped provide unbiased recommendations on fracking.
Against this backdrop, the industry critics who stick their necks out and try to cobble together the material and the science to show harm or potential harm relating to shale-gas extraction and development are in a lose-lose situation. Anyone who attempts to challenge Big Oil and Gas is in an impossible bind, because whether their work has merit or not they will likely be placed under a microscope and met with alarming hostility. They can expect to be eviscerated by the industry, the industry's paid bloggers, and those in media seeking "balance" who pit richly-funded academic/industry press-packet "facts" against the findings of those who challenge those "facts."
In order to have meaningful conversations about bias on shale issues, it is perhaps not the best use of media influence to give too much criticism to young Ph.D. candidates attempting to investigate potential for public harm, at a time when academic/industry groups have so thoroughly saturated the media with mind-numbing propaganda.
MIT's "Future of Natural Gas" report was largely supported by Aubrey McClendon's America's Clean Skies Foundation, and John Deutch was a study participant. Is this an academic report? Or an industry report? What is its merit? Does it have merit? Why isn't anyone asking these questions?
According to the MIT Energy Initiative website: "MIT's energy studies and reports are making a difference, providing both Congress and the executive branch with detailed recommendations to shape and influence energy policy debates, responses, and outcomes."
When New York Times public editor Arthur Brisbane criticized Ian Urbina's reporting in his "Drilling Down" series, ironically, Brisbane cited that study as a source that "took issue" with Urbina's reporting, it was an industry-funded study. He said, "An M.I.T. natural gas study group released a statement taking issue with The Times's analysis of shale gas economics, well productivity and other matters."
I'm not a former C.I.A. director, the public editor, a noted academic, journalist, columnist or elected official. Nobody cares about my letters, comments and op-eds on the big issues of conflicts of interest in relation to shale studies and shale science. COI (conflict of interest) is becoming BAU (business as usual) and perhaps ordinary people like me need to come to grips with the reality that in all honesty, as long as the right people are happily lining their pockets, nobody cares.

HEADLINE: July 28: Missouri Slipping Away From Democrats

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: Two polls give Mitt Romney a nine-point advantage in the state. 

 BODY:
Missouri, the state that was once considered the nation's ultimate bellwether, looks as though it is likely to be out of reach for President Obama this year, unless there is a significant shift toward him in the final 100 days of the campaign.
A Mason-Dixon poll of the state, released on Saturday, gave Mitt Romney a nine-point lead there. Mr. Romney's nine-point lead matches his advantage from another poll of the state, conducted by the firm We Ask America, which was released earlier this week.
The forecast model now estimates that Mr. Romney has an 88 percent chance of winning Missouri in November. And Missouri has fallen off the list of tipping point states, meaning that it is very unlikely to be a decisive state in determining the winner of the Electoral College. The cases where Mr. Obama wins Missouri are probably those where he is headed toward some sort of near-landslide in the national race, like because of an unexpected rebound in the economy.
Democrats have made gains in some parts of the country in recent years - most notably in the Mountain West and in Virginia, which has increasingly begun to behave as a Northern state. But they have receded in the poorer states of the upland South, like Missouri, Arkansas, Kentucky, Tennessee and West Virginia.
With the exception of a few urban centers like Knoxville, Tenn., these regions have always been culturally conservative. But they also once had a reputation for being economically moderate or even populist, tending to support elements of the welfare state.
In the past four presidential elections, political partisanship has become more uni-dimensional, with a higher percentage of voters tending to align with the same party on both economic and social issues - even though there is often little intrinsic relation between them. In this part of the country, the trade seems to have worked against Democrats - or at least it has worked against the fairly liberal Democrats who have been the party's presidential nominees in the past four election cycles.
Over all, Mr. Romney's chances of winning the Electoral College improved somewhat in Saturday's forecast, to 32.6 percent from 30.9 percent on Friday, according to the model.
One reason for Mr. Romney's improvement - in addition to his strong Missouri poll - was that we went back and double-checked our polling database for cases in which polling firms had reported both registered voter and likely voter results within the same survey release.
A comparison between these numbers forms the basis of the forecast model's likely voter adjustment, which shifts numbers from polls of registered voters toward Republican candidates since Republicans typically perform better on surveys that estimate how likely each voter is to actually participate in the election.
The model shifts registered voter polls toward the Republican candidate by 1.5 percentage points as a default, since this is the average change from previous presidential election years. But the adjustment can increase or decrease as additional data becomes available. Based on the data so far this year, the model now estimates that the shift will be slightly larger than average this year, equal to about 2.3 percentage points instead.

BYLINE: EMMARIE HUETTEMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Robert Gibbs of the Obama campaign, Kevin Madden of the Romney campaign and Justice Antonin Scalia join the Sunday shows this week. 

 BODY:
With 100 days until Election Day, both presidential campaigns will be represented on the Sunday talk shows.
On ABC's "This Week," Robert Gibbs, a senior adviser to the Obama campaign, and Kevin Madden, a senior adviser to the Romney campaign, will weigh in on the week's events, including Mitt Romney's diplomatic misstep of questioning London's preparedness for the Olympics.
Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, and Senator Kelly Ayotte, Republican of New Hampshire, will talk about the candidates' foreign policy plans on CNN's "State of the Union" as Mr. Romney embarks on the next leg of his international tour, to Israel.
"Fox News Sunday" features an exclusive interview with Justice Antonin Scalia, who will talk about his new book and share his thoughts on some of the Supreme Court's major decisions and his own judicial philosophy.
Justice Scalia's former colleague on the bench, Sandra Day O'Connor, will appear on CBS's "Face the Nation" to share her own thoughts about the state of the court. And less than a week after Monday's announcement of the N.C.A.A.'s sanctions against Penn State, CBS will also talk to Rodney Erickson, the university's president, about the aftermath of the child sexual abuse scandal involving Jerry Sandusky, a former assistant football coach.
Also on CBS: Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, will discuss the presidential race.
Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House minority leader, is the guest on Bloomberg's "Political Capital" this week.
On C-Span's "Newsmakers," Representative Sander M. Levin of Michigan, ranking Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, will talk about the tax choices facing Congress, as well as the economy.
Bill Richardson, former New Mexico governor, will appear on Univision's "Al Punto," where he will share his thoughts on the presidential race, immigration and relations with Latin America.
NBC's "Meet the Press" is off for two weeks because of the coverage of the Olympics. TV One's "Washington Watch" is on hiatus until the fall.

HEADLINE: The Weekend Word: Exposed

BYLINE: JADA F. SMITH


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times, plus a look at the president's weekly address and the latest happenings in Washington. 

 BODY:
Today's Times

        
Despite warnings of a potentially crippling cyberattack, a group of lawmakers led by Senator John McCain has successfully weakened bipartisan legislation that the White House said was crucial to protecting computer systems responsible for much of the nation's critical infrastructure, Michael S. Schmidt reports. The changes have raised new questions about the legislation's effectiveness, but Mr. McCain says that forcing industries to comply with "government red tape" is not the answer to fighting threats.

        
Complications with Mitt Romney's weekend schedule in Israel are examples of the challenges politicians face whenever American and Israeli politics intersect, Jodi Rudoren and Ashley Parker report. The trip is a critical opportunity to show statesmanship and to highlight Mr. Romney's relationship with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, but the timing has turned out to be both auspicious and fraught.

        
Throughout the election cycle, Mitt Romney's team hastried to build a low-risk campaign, resulting in an operation that is often scrambling to catch up rather than making its own news and controlling the narrative, Ashley Parker writes.
Though revenues have fallen, federal spending has been reduced as well, leading to a projected deficit of $1.2 trillion in fiscal year 2012 rather than $1.3 trillion, Jackie Calmes reports. While such reductions would have been heralded as significant not many years ago, in the post-recession era the amounts are widely seen as woefully insufficient for addressing the country's budgetary imbalance.

        
President Obama used his weekly address to discuss a proposed extension on middle-class tax cuts, saying that "everyone in Washington says they agree on this." The Senate has passed legislation already, but he says that Republicans in the House are holding the tax cuts hostage until there is an extension for wealthy Americans as well. "You see, Republicans in Congress and their nominee for president believe that the best way to create prosperity in America is to let it trickle down from the top," he said. "They're wrong. And I know they're wrong because we already tried it that way for most of the last decade. It didn't work."
Happenings in Washington

        
Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District of Columbia's nonvoting Democratic delegate in Congress, will celebrate National Dance Day on the Mall with personalities from the television show "So You Think You Can Dance."

        
Spy artifacts from the Cold War will be on display at the Fairfax County Army Navy Club.

HEADLINE: A Spectrum of Traditions

BYLINE: By HIKMET ERSEK. 
As told to Patricia R. Olsen.

 BODY:
MY mother is a Christian from Austria and my father a Muslim from Turkey. They met and married in Paris and settled in Istanbul, my father's home. I was born there and attended an Austrian school in the city. At 19, I moved to Austria to attend what is now the Vienna University of Economics and Business.
I'm 6-foot-2 and was good at basketball. While attending university, I was recruited to play semipro ball in Austria. As a result, it took me longer than usual to complete a combined undergraduate and graduate degree in economics, called a magister, in Austria. But it was worth it. I was able to be paid for my hobby and travel around Europe for tournaments. 
My first job, in 1986, was in sales for Europay MasterCard, now MasterCard. I was responsible for signing up merchants such as hotels and restaurants. I rose to vice president for sales and marketing and left 10 years later to work for GE Capital as vice president for retail sales finance and then for consumer financing. A year later, in 1997, General Electric asked me to be national executive for GE Corporate as well, responsible for Austria.
In 1999, I joined Western Union Financial Services and held various executive positions and traveled throughout Europe and Asia. Over more than 25 years, I've learned how globalization works and how to navigate in new countries, traveling to 81 so far.
In January 2010, I was promoted to chief operating officer of the Western Union Company and moved to Colorado. Eight months later, I became president and C.E.O. Western Union had always been a brick-and-mortar company, where customers sent or received funds through our agents in grocery stores, post offices and the like. When I took over, I instituted a number of changes to modernize operations. Not only did we add more agent locations, but customers can now send money using a credit card. We also added prepaid cards and a mobile wallet application.
Last year, we bought Travelex Global Business Payments and introduced a business-to-business electronic money transfer service for importers and exporters and other small- and medium-size businesses. People are often surprised that Western Union has transformed itself in two years, but it's still happened too slowly for me.
I can relate personally to one of these changes. My parents divorced years ago, and my mother moved to Vienna. My father, 88, still lives in Turkey. I've been sending him money for medicine and other needs every week for years, from whatever country I'm in. He has a cellphone but doesn't use it. Before I became C.E.O., he had to walk a mile or two to the closest Western Union agent. Now there's one much closer, and thousands of other people can send and receive funds in several ways.
We've been criticized for our fees, but we have been an industry leader in providing transparency to our customers about our prices. And we have millions of satisfied customers, which is why we continue to grow. We have just under an 18 percent market share in an extremely competitive environment for money transfers, and consumers have more options today as to how, where and when they can send money. I believe that in an open market, competition and consumer behavior determine the price.
Besides the diversity I experienced as a child, I married Nayantara Ghosh-Ersek, who is half-Austrian and half-Indian. We met in Austria. At home, we celebrate Christmas as well as Hindu and Muslim holidays. Our company serves a global population, so we pay attention to traditions around the world. Diversity attracts diversity.

HEADLINE: Sea, Shops and, Oh, Casinos

BYLINE: By STEVEN McELROY

 BODY:
ON a Sunday afternoon in June, I worked hard to whack moles in a carnival game at Steel Pier, a small amusement park that juts out into the ocean from the Atlantic City Boardwalk. I didn't win a stuffed animal, but the winner was one of my friends, which was not surprising considering that we four were the only contestants in this dense wonderland of rides and games that, for a summer weekend, wasn't terribly crowded. 
Steel Pier, which opened in 1898, is in the midst of a $100 million makeover and is at the heart of an effort to spruce up the Boardwalk and surrounding areas and take the focus off gambling.
Tourism dollars in New Jersey are sorely needed: gaming revenues, once the lifeblood of Atlantic City, have steadily declined (pdf) since 2006, owing in part to a recession that drove down consumer spending and in part to increased competition from new casinos nearby that save their patrons the expense of travel and an overnight stay. But government, tourism and casino officials in Atlantic City have no intention of folding. In fact, they're doubling down.
The recently formed Atlantic City Alliance and the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority are collaborating on DO AC, the biggest tourism marketing campaign in the city's history. The push to draw more visitors largely relies on publicizing reasons to visit besides gambling -- some DO AC advertisements do not even feature casinos -- and making the city cleaner and safer.
''The city is built on the casino industry,'' said John Palmieri, executive director of the development authority, ''and we need to support it but we need to grow the economy and diversify the economy.''
But what, besides casinos, can Atlantic City justifiably market?
A number of attractions fall within a new tourism district announced by Gov. Chris Christie last year and overseen by the development authority. In addition to the upgrade at Steel Pier, improvements are under way at the Atlantic City Historical Museum and the Atlantic City Arts Center. The city also has a long beach off the Boardwalk, of course, and work there includes creating stronger barriers to combat beach erosion. A public art installation is among several other projects on tap, many financed by the casinos themselves, which have pledged to pump a percentage of their revenue into the effort.
Casinos are supplementing these offerings by focusing on their nongambling attractions, like concerts, shopping and dining. The biggest booster on that front this year is the Revel, a splashy resort that opened in April and is home to a concert space, several restaurants, a hotel and myriad other draws.
''Everybody recognizes that the real future of Atlantic City rests in making the pie bigger, not in just cutting up the pie,'' said Kevin DeSanctis, chairman and chief executive of Revel. ''The only way to do that is to figure out a way to add more amenities and more nongaming amenities so this really evolves into a much broader regional destination.''
The Borgata, which recently spent $50 million revamping its guest rooms and has plenty of nongaming attractions, has the same philosophy, within limits.
''Our goal is to spend $30 million to grow the market,'' said Tom Ballance, a senior vice president at the Borgata. ''Then we compete fiercely.''

HEADLINE: You Can't Beat It With a Stick

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE ULRICH

 BODY:
NOT many Americans still want a car with a manual transmission. And for the Facebook generation, a car with a third pedal near the floorboard (it's called a clutch) might as well be a Hudson Hornet.
For those reasons, fewer automakers -- even exotic brands like Lamborghini -- are bothering with stick shifts. So while a small cadre of enthusiasts can praise Acura for offering a 6-speed manual in its 2013 ILX , one wonders if the sales strategy will someday be studied in business schools as a cautionary tale of misguided marketing: the most powerful, desirable version of this compact sport sedan isn't available with an automatic transmission at all.
Essentially, if you refuse to wrangle a stick and a clutch -- or can't sell your significant other on the arrangement -- you may want to cross the ILX off your list. Save thousands and get a Ford Focus, a Mazda 3 or another sporty compact with a lot of features but no luxury pretensions. It's really that simple. And the problem isn't that the ILX is a bad car. The problem is that it is three cars. 
One of these is impressive, and the others are largely forgettable, all because of the sort of self-sabotage that we've seen too often of late from Honda and its upscale Acura division.
The good news is that although the ILX is a deluxe makeover of the Honda Civic, most people would never guess they're related. Once the most flavorful of compact cars, the Civic has been watered down like a cheap margarita. The ILX feels quite different: it looks better and drives sharper, and it is peaceful and pleasing inside.
Smart alecks will lazily accuse the ILX of being a Civic with leather seats, but one trip around the block would change their tune. The Acura's fine road manners recall the slightly larger Accord-based Acura TSX.
Drop in the TSX's 2.4-liter engine, which feels stronger than its 201-horsepower rating, and you have an under-the-radar sport sedan, a touch lighter and faster than the ever-reliable TSX. The base price is $30,095, about $5,000 more than you'd spend on loaded versions of everyday compacts.
And while a $30,000 compact sedan tends to set American eyeballs rolling, the combination of this engine -- still one of the world's great 4-cylinders -- and generous features makes this version of the ILX, the 2.4L, an attractive proposition.
But here's the catch: the 2.4L, the version that truly justifies its entry-luxury price, can be obtained only with a 6-speed manual transmission. Way to go, Honda: you just eliminated, oh, about 95 percent of the customers who'd even consider spending $30,000 or more on a small sedan.
Worse, when those manual-shift die-hards show up at the dealer, determined to get a top-shelf ILX -- with all the luxury goodies that help to justify the price -- they'll also learn that they cannot have a voice-activated navigation system, even as an option. That feature, the sales representative will be forced to explain, is available on only the base model and the Hybrid.
The 2.4L buyer is also denied the AcuraLink satellite communications system, real-time traffic and weather reports and 15 gigabytes of music storage.
That leaves the two other ILX models for the people who demand an automatic transmission -- pretty much everyone -- and the latest in-car technology. Yet both seem like shakier propositions, including the starter model, the 2.0L.
Priced from $26,795, this is the ILX that screams ''compromise'' at the top of its little 2-liter lungs, with standard cloth seats and just 150 breathless horses from a version of the Civic engine. The base model is a car that dogs will chase, sniff and recognize as one of their own.
And once you throw in the options that make a ''premium'' compact premium, the price of the 2.0L can reach $32,295. That's a lot for a sedan with an econobox engine and no more oomph than cars that cost around $20,000.
In comparison, the new Buick Verano offers a 180-horsepower 4-cylinder in its base model (with a 250-horsepower turbo version on its way), and the Audi A3 features a fat 200 horsepower from a brilliant turbo 4-cylinder.
Options on the 2.0L come in two straightforward groups.
The $3,300 Premium Package includes heated leather seats, a power driver's seat, 17-inch wheels, a 360-watt audio system, high-intensity headlamps, fog lamps, a rearview camera and active noise cancellation, which quells annoying sound frequencies that intrude into the cabin.
The package also features a Pandora Internet radio interface and a Bluetooth-enabled feature that can read incoming text messages out loud. It even lets drivers send six preset replies using voice commands.
Then there is a $2,200 Technology Package that adds the navigation system and surround-sound audio.
And while the ILX 2.0L is offered exclusively with an automatic transmission, it is the prosaic 5-speed from the Civic. You can get 6 speeds on any number of bargain-basement compacts.
There is a third model, the ILX Hybrid, which seems to have the market potential of an Uggs store in Sudan. Starting at $29,795, or $3,000 above the base ILX, this model adopts the Civic Hybrid's 111-horsepower gas engine and gives it an electric motor assist.
Add on the Hybrid's $5,500 Technology Package (which includes every available feature save 17-inch wheels), and buyers are looking at $35,295 for a small hybrid that can't break 40 miles per gallon. (The government rating is 39 m.p.g. in the city and 38 on the highway. For comparison, the strikingly styled Lexus CT 200h tops the Acura with a 43/40 m.p.g. rating.
Asked about the odd lineup decisions, Acura executives said the 2.4-liter, manual-only ILX was positioned as the high-performance model. For customers who prefer an automatic, the executives added, there's always the TSX.
My hunch is that once its dealers' howls stop reverberating, Acura will relent and offer an automatic on the most desirable ILX, the 2.4L. While at it, Acura might drop the base engine entirely, along with the pretense, to establish what the ILX is supposed to be: an entertaining Euro-style sport compact.
For now, that ILX 2.4L is good enough to send people to remedial shifting school to brush up on their clutch work.
Across the line, Acura revamped the Civic stem-to-stern with a lighter and stiffer structure (including aluminum bits); more sound deadening, thicker laminated windows and aerodynamic covers below the floor; a nearly 7 percent faster steering ratio with more precisely machined gears; and a sportier suspension, including dual-stage shock absorbers and lower-friction bushings.
The stability system borrows advanced controls from Honda's Asimo humanoid robot, with faster reactions and an ability to make automatic steering corrections to counter skids.
The resulting car can't break-dance like the adorable robot, but it is handsome and entertaining. Even for those who choose the more frugal powertrains, the Acura feels like a legitimate entry-luxury car down to its smartly tailored cabin. Guiding the Acura over a gravel-choked road, its solidity and quietness made an instant impression.
Aging boy racers who loved their old Integras or RSXs may be let down by this more subtle approach. But the top-shelf Acura is no poseur, save for its modest all-season Michelin tires.
The Buick Verano is a stylish and reasonably charming car. But the Acura feels more fun and sophisticated -- as does the TSX compared with the Buick Regal. The ILX beats the Verano on engine performance, quick and sensitive steering, suspension and bump control and shifter feel. (The turbo Verano will have a chance to even the score.)
Honda recalled about 6,000 ILXs this month to repair a potentially faulty door latch, though no customers had reported a problem with the car.
Helping to wring every drop from the 2.4L's 7,000-r.p.m. engine and 170 pound-feet of torque, the Acura's shifter and clutch are the smoothest synchronized pair this side of a $100,000 Porsche 911S. This powertrain scoots the ILX from a standstill to 60 m.p.h. in about seven seconds, roughly two seconds quicker than the starter model.
But you'd better check your watch for the unhurried Hybrid, which arrives at 60 m.p.h roughly four seconds after the sporty ILX 2.4L.
The 2.4 engine does consume slightly more gas, with a 22/31 miles per gallon rating versus 24/35 for the 2-liter model.
I happened to drive the ILX back to back with Acura's redesigned RDX crossover. Both the sprightly RDX and high-end ILX chalked up all the performance and features you'd expect in their categories. Yet the RDX doesn't dabble in multiple powertrains or raise shifter barriers to potential buyers. It's a tremendously versatile crossover and feels like a clear bargain against rivals like the Lexus RX 350, Audi Q5 and BMW X3. As such, the RDX is just the kind of all-aboard winner that Acura needs to re-establish itself as a smart, practical choice among luxury brands.
But aside from hybrid fanatics with $30,000-plus to burn, the ILX seems limited to fans of shift-it-yourself compacts at a relatively high price. Because either group might struggle to fill a high school gym, Acura should act quickly to expand the appeal of the ILX before it slips through the market's cracks.
INSIDE TRACK: Slicing the market too thin.

A Flood Caused by Work at Neighbor's
QMy co-op apartment became uninhabitable as a result of a flood that occurred when a bathroom renovation job in an upstairs apartment went wrong. It took four months before I was able to move back in. Am I still liable for maintenance payments for that time period?
A ''It is likely that the shareholder would be entitled to an abatement in maintenance and that the co-op corporation would be liable for a breach of warranty of habitability,'' said Barry H. Mandel, a Manhattan co-op and condo lawyer. He says the co-op can probably assert a claim against the renovating neighbor under the provisions of the proprietary lease and the alteration agreement. 
Stabilized Tenant Loses Parking Space
QI am a rent-stabilized tenant in a co-op building. When the building converted to a co-op, the board said all rent-stabilized tenants had to relinquish their parking spaces to those buying apartments. But we just discovered that the board has allowed a few tenants to continue to rent spaces. Is this legal?
A ''The answer would depend on the circumstances,'' said Ronald S. Languedoc, a Manhattan lawyer who represents tenants. For example, a stabilized tenant who never had a parking space has no right to apply for one unless the board has a policy of granting spaces to nonpurchasing tenants and shareholders. If a stabilized tenant had a space and was required to give it up, that could be considered a ''reduction in service,'' in violation of the Rent Stabilization Law. So any stabilized tenant forced to give up a parking space could file a complaint with the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, which could result in a rent reduction order. The tenant could also sue for an order compelling the board to return the parking space.
Safety Concerns About Co-op Hoarder
QI recently visited an apartment in our eight-unit co-op and was shocked by what I saw. There were piles of old newspapers and other things throughout the unit, and only a narrow path remained to get from room to room. I worry about the safety of our building, especially in a fire. What can the board do?
A Theresa Racht, a Manhattan co-op and condominium lawyer, says most proprietary leases contain provisions that could apply in this situation. For example, most have: a requirement that owners maintain the apartment in good repair and condition; a mandate against creating a nuisance; and a prohibition against allowing anything in the apartment that would increase the fire insurance rate on the building. ''Boards can declare the shareholder in default of these provisions, which can ultimately lead to gaining possession of the apartment,'' Ms. Racht said. The board can also give the shareholder a 30-day notice to remedy the conditions and, if he fails to do so, remedy the conditions at his expense. ''There are also housing-court proceedings that can be brought to compel a cleanup of the apartment,'' she said. She noted that the board should first ascertain whether physical or mental illness, or the shareholder's age, interferes with his ability to remedy the unsafe conditions without assistance. If the shareholder does need assistance, the co-op should consult a laywer to see if any additional program or assistance is available.

HEADLINE: Hope in the Wreckage

BYLINE: By SUZY HANSEN

 BODY:
One morning this spring, Claudia Cox, a registered nurse in Jackson, Miss., drove toward the countryside to visit some patients. She often has trouble finding their homes. ''The rural people are the worst,'' she said. '' 'Come to the oak tree.' Well, hell, I'm from the city, I don't know what no oak tree is. I know magnolia. I know pine trees.'' Cox referred to her seven-year-old Ford Freestyle as her ''office,'' but it had the ambience of an arcade: the ding-ding-ding from her dashboard signaling an unbuckled seat belt, the whir of a phone charger in the cigarette lighter, the phone ringing with the opening of Cheryl Lynn's disco hit ''Got to Be Real.'' Cox, a 45-year-old divorced mother of three, juggled phone calls and patients' charts and cigarettes like some serene octopus, always catching the steering wheel just before the vehicle veered onto the grass. After 20 minutes, she pulled into a pebbly driveway. It was time to find out why Vonda Wells kept going back to the emergency room. 
Cox works for an agency called HealthConnect, whose purpose is to reduce admissions to the Central Mississippi Medical Center, a Jackson hospital where people routinely use the emergency room for primary care, sometimes multiple times in a month.
Wells's large figure filled the door frame of the tiny house. She was jovial despite the oxygen tube that ran to her nose. She held a baby. ''Is that yours?'' Cox exclaimed.
''That's my grandbaby!'' Wells said and passed the baby off to a teenager who disappeared behind a closed door. The two women sat down in a dark living room cramped with couches.
''All right, Ms. Wells, we come out and check on everybody,'' Cox said. ''You had pneumonia, right?''
''I went to Florida, and that's where I first got sick, at the Holy Land.''
''O.K.,'' Cox scribbled, and then looked up. ''What's that?''
''It's an amusement park out there, but it has Jerusalem, it has Noah's Ark, they did the play the Passion . . .''
''Now there's another spot for me and my baby to go!'' Cox said. They laughed.
Cox doesn't know oak trees, but she knows how to talk to people. She knows when to ask if someone cannot afford insulin, or is not taking insulin, or is not keeping the insulin cold, or cannot keep the insulin cold because there is no electricity or refrigerator. Not having health insurance is a huge problem in Mississippi, but it isn't the only one. ''So you good with doing your medicines?'' Wells made a guilty face. ''You oxygen-dependent?'' She was.
Wells worked at a Jackson hospital as a certified nursing assistant for five years before she started getting sick with asthma-related illnesses. No one wanted a nurse who needed an oxygen tank, she said, so now she was trying to work a handful of hours a week at a Christian community center. ''I stayed in Illinois for 25 years,'' she said. ''I didn't really have asthma symptoms till I came down here.''
''There's something in the house that's triggering it,'' Cox said. ''I bet you need to get tested for mold.'' She made a note. The house was old, the rug thick, the air damp. ''And I'm putting a little check mark down here that you got the basic light, gas and water. Your major problem is the asthma.''
''And congestive heart failure.''
Cox tilted her head. ''Have you been taught how to manage your congestive heart failure? Because you should have a scale.'' She looked around the house gamely, as if she believed a scale might pop out from behind the TV.
''I need a scale?''
''You need a scale, and you need to do a weight every morning. Because if you get on a scale and there's a three-pound difference from one day to the next, you're starting to retain fluid. I see that your legs are already swollen.''
Cox explained why people retain fluid. She then asked whether Wells had checked her blood pressure; her emergency-room chart indicated it had been 212 over 100, which is stroke level. Concerned about Wells's sodium intake, she asked her how many sodas she was drinking, and told her that some juice has a lot of sodium in it too. ''Knowledge is power, O.K.?'' Cox said gently. ''Cause you're 40, and you're oxygen-dependent. We don't want you goin' on a date with an oxygen tank!'' Wells laughed again.
Cox said she would try to find a company that would test the house for toxins, and she made an appointment for Wells to visit a medical clinic that HealthConnect operates. Wells got up, the oxygen tube dragging behind her, and walked Cox to the door. Cox paused at one of the photographs on the wall. ''You got a beautiful family!'' Cox said. She focused on a slim woman. ''Now, is that Mama?''
''That's Grandma,'' Wells said. ''She was 95 when she passed. I moved down here to help her out.''
One of the people responsible for HealthConnect's holistic, intensely personal approach is Dr. Aaron Shirley, who three years ago found inspiration for health care reform in an unlikely place: the primary health care system created in the 1980s in the Islamic Republic of Iran. The main issue in Iran back then was ''disparities in health between its urban and rural populations,'' he told me recently. ''In the U.S., these disparities exist. The Iranian model eliminated the geographic disparities, so why couldn't this same approach be used for racial and geographic disparities in the U.S.?''
Shirley created HealthConnect in 2010 because -- and, in part, to prove to others that -- poor people in Mississippi still have health problems, even if they have Medicaid or health insurance, even if there are clinics in their communities, even if they get home health services. They don't get better, and the diseases born of poverty and obesity are not prevented; thousands of people frequent emergency rooms for illnesses that could have been tackled by primary care. They need something more.
Shirley is a civil rights-era hero who for a long time was the only black pediatrician in the state, the type of activist who, he says, wasn't necessarily of the ''nonviolent persuasion'' and who, upon hearing that the local Klan was headed to his home, would warn the Police Department that both his boys knew how to shoot. He was the first black resident at the University of Mississippi Medical Center and, in the 1960s, worked at the state's first community health center, in the Mississippi Delta. He did things that don't end up in history books, too, like build wells for poor blacks when they didn't have clean drinking water and travel through the countryside treating malnourished babies. In 1993, the MacArthur Foundation identified him as a ''health care leader'' when it gave him one of its ''genius'' awards.
Shirley, now 79, spends his days at the Jackson Medical Mall. For decades, the site was an actual mall, with a JC Penney and a Gayfers, but the area around it began to decline in the 1980s as middle-class families fled to suburbs nearby. Historic downtown Jackson emptied out altogether, and today Capitol Street, the bustling shopping avenue that Medgar Evers boycotted in 1962, looks shuttered and ghostly. The mall, just five minutes from downtown, was well on its way to the same fate, so in the mid-1990s Shirley and others created the Jackson Medical Mall Foundation to buy it and turn it into a center offering various health services for the poor.
Since then, Shirley has observed up close what so many Mississippians point out: millions of dollars pour into the state every year -- both public and private funds -- but the lives of Mississippians do not improve. ''I've been coming here for 40 years,'' he told me recently, referring to the Mississippi Delta, ''and nothing has changed.''
In 2008, Shirley was introduced to a consultant named James Miller by a public health professor at Jackson State University, Mohammad Shahbazi. Miller and his wife live in Oxford, Miss., where they and other family members run a consulting firm and other businesses. In 2004, Miller learned about Iran's primary-care health system during a meeting in Germany with a delegation from the Iranian government. But it wasn't until 2007, when a struggling hospital hired Miller's firm to conduct an assessment of its operations, that Miller fully grasped the extent of Mississippi's health care crisis -- and recognized how much it resembled prerevolutionary Iran.
''When the Iranian system was developed in the 1980s, there were no doctors in rural Iran,'' Miller says. ''And this is similar to the problem in the delta today.''
The Iranian reforms were relatively inexpensive to implement there. It was the early '80s, just after the Ayatollah Khomeini's return and the Iranian revolution, which had promised the country's rural villagers the kind of social justice that had been lacking under the shah. At the time, more than half the population lived outside major cities, in or around more than 60,000 villages. The Iranians built ''health houses'' to minister to 1,500 people who lived within at most an hour's walking distance. Each house is a 1,000-square-foot hut equipped with examination rooms and sleeping quarters and staffed by community health workers -- one man and one or more women who have been given basic training in preventive health care. They advise on nutrition and family planning, take blood pressure, keep track of who needs prenatal care, provide immunization and monitor environmental conditions like water quality. Crucially, in order to gain trust, the health workers come from the villages they serve.
People who become very sick, or require surgical procedures, are referred up through a single, multitiered system: from health house to rural health center to district hospital. The integrated nature of the system is what makes it unique. Today, 17,000 health houses serve 23 million rural Iranians. Health disparities between rural and urban Iranians have narrowed; the Iranians have reduced rural infant mortality by 75 percent and lowered the birthrate. Iran's reforms won praise from the World Health Organization, which has long advocated preventive, primary care.
To Miller, the model's great appeal was its simplicity. He approached several academic institutions in Mississippi and told them what he'd learned. Most people looked at him as if he were nuts. The United States and Iran haven't been on good terms since the hostage crisis in 1979. It is not a country Americans tend to think of collaborating with. But Miller, who loves Persian history and doesn't disguise his desire to see the United States and Iran mend their fences, spoke to Gail Harrison, a public-health professor at U.C.L.A. She suggested he call a former student of hers: Mohammad Shahbazi, who was not only Iranian but also a professor at Jackson State University, a historically black college right in Mississippi.
Shahbazi moved to the United States in the 1980s for graduate work in cultural anthropology and became fascinated by its health care problems. He recognized the similarities between the conditions in Mississippi and those in Iran, where he grew up as a member of a nomadic tribe, the Qashqai, that was discriminated against under the shah. ''We were considered the wild, smelly nomads,'' he says. He decided that Mississippi offered the best opportunity for his work on social determinants of health, and settled into a between-worlds existence in Jackson, where he is neither black nor white but privy to racial slights and resentments from both sides. ''I consider myself bleached black,'' he says.
After joining Jackson State's public health program, he often wanted to discuss Iran's health care reforms in wider policy circles, but feared doing so in the post-9/11 climate. Shahbazi, who is animated and friendly and tends to make jokes like ''we don't have pharmacologists, we have harm/acologists,'' was once pulled aside by a federal agent at an airport because he thought Shahbazi was on a most-wanted terrorist list. When the agent showed Shahbazi the list, Shahbazi exclaimed, ''But I am not Shabaz Mohammad of Pakistan, I am Mohammad Shahbazi of Iran!''
Shahbazi suggested that he and Miller approach Shirley. He arranged for the two men to visit Shiraz, Iran, and meet some of the people responsible for creating and administering the country's health houses. The two groups decided to establish an official academic partnership between Shiraz University and Jackson State, and Shirley returned to Mississippi a convert. Later that year, several Iranian doctors and administrators and their wives made their own trip to Mississippi. They were surprised by what they saw: ''This is America?'' they asked. In 2010, the Iranians returned for a month, calculating how many health houses Mississippi would need, as they had done in Iran. Shahbazi began work on a program at Jackson State for the training of community health workers. Using resources from the Medical Mall Foundation, Shirley started HealthConnect to show how interventionist, door-to-door community health workers might save hospitals money and began the process of putting health houses in Jackson schools. Eventually they hope to build the Mississippi Community Health House Network, a pilot version of their project, in the Mississippi Delta.
''We are not saying just trust us,'' Shahbazi says. ''We are saying give us $10 to $20 million and three years; we'll implement 15 health houses in the delta, and we will prove two things: We will show you that we are changing the health outcomes, and we will show we can reduce the cost of health care in the state.''
Mississippi has some of the worst health statistics in the country. A Mississippi black man's life expectancy is lower than the average American's life expectancy was in 1960. Sixty-nine percent of adult Mississippians are obese or overweight, and a quarter of the state's households don't have access to decent, healthful food. Adequate grocery stores can be 30 miles away. In one of the country's most fertile regions, people sometimes have to shop for their groceries at the gas station. Consequently, Mississippians are dying from diabetes, hypertension, congestive heart failure and asthma. Shirley points out that in the 1960s people starved, and today they die from food.
The state has the highest rate of teen births in the nation. Currently there is one abortion clinic in Mississippi, and Gov. Phil Bryant, a former deputy sheriff, is working hard to render it inoperable. Until this year, schools taught abstinence. In the United States, the black infant mortality rate is more than twice that of white infants, so Mississippi, which is 37 percent black, has huge neonatal intensive care units. Caring for the thousands of premature babies (weighing between one and four pounds) costs millions of dollars. According to Dr. Glen Graves of the University of Mississippi Medical Center, these tiny, deprived babies grow up to be plagued with chronic illnesses.
Human Rights Watch calls the Deep South ''the epicenter of the H.I.V. epidemic in the United States, with more people living and dying of AIDS than in any region in the country.'' Blacks in Mississippi are dying from AIDS at a rate 64 percent higher than the nation's average. In the delta, which stretches north and west of Jackson and is home to 560,000 people, H.I.V./AIDS is an immense but silent crisis. The state Department of Health estimates that half of H.I.V.-positive Mississippians currently don't receive treatment.
Many delta hospitals complain that their emergency rooms are overrun with nonpaying patients. Dr. James Keeton, the vice chancellor for health affairs at the University of Mississippi Medical Center, says that 14 percent of the center's patients are uninsured, or ''self-pay,'' and the hospital recovers only a small part of what they owe. ''Now, I say to you as a businessperson: How would you like to work at an auto company and give away . . . cars before even opening your doors?''
Of the state's population of nearly three million, 550,000 are uninsured. At the moment, Governor Bryant is claiming that the state might not accept federal money to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. But even if it does, there won't be enough doctors to see all the Mississippians who need them; the state has 176 doctors per 100,000 people, the lowest such number in the country.
Sixty years ago, Mississippi, the country's poorest and most racially divided state, was ''the standard by which this nation's commitment to social justice would be measured,'' the historian John Dittmer wrote. Talk to those in Mississippi's health care community, and they all whisper the same thing: It's not rocket science; we all know what needs to be done. In short, as one Mississippian put it to me, ''hand-to-hand combat'' -- hiring folks whose sole job is to ameliorate the problems in poor people's lives -- and a tremendous amount of money could change the situation. But the political will does not exist. So the status quo endures: generations of people who can't afford fresh tomatoes, and who don't understand that when a doctor says take this pill three times a day, he doesn't mean all at once.
In May, Shirley, Shahbazi and a black pediatrician named Eva Henderson-Camara piled into Shahbazi's car and headed to the delta to talk to two nurses at a small hospital in Belzoni, more than an hour north of Jackson. The first thing you notice on entering the delta, especially when you're expecting to find poverty, is that you don't see many people. The farms are vast and empty. So much of the area is bucolic and sun-dappled that it doesn't seem poor. When I said as much to Claudia Cox about Mississippi in general, she replied sternly: ''That's because poverty in America doesn't look like what y'all think. It used to be bare feet, now it's Nikes. If I miss two months of work because I get sick, well, guess what? I'm in poverty. This is the new poverty.'' Yet in delta towns like Louise and Midnight, the poverty is impossible to miss: desolate commercial streets in the shadow of a rotting mill, shotgun houses wilting on one side of railroad tracks, houses almost buried under possessions on the porch and in the yard.
Henderson-Camara, now 60, grew up on the plantation her grandfather owned. Children at the time worked much of the school year as part of the sharecropper system, which lasted until the '70s, as corporations bought and mechanized the farms. (''Imagine waking up every morning and this is all you see,'' Henderson-Camara said, looking out the window at the flat fields stretching to the sky. ''And you think, Should I shoot myself now or later?'') Thousands of displaced workers found jobs at the Jockey factory, or the Schwinn plant, or on catfish farms, but those shut down in the early '90s. Henderson-Camara got out by winning a scholarship for a fifth year of high school at Yale. Today she lives in Jackson and works in HealthConnect's medical clinic.
In Belzoni, everyone sat down at a rectangular table, and the director of nursing, Dee Ann Brown, recounted the hospital's troubles: emergency-room readmissions, obesity, inadequate insurance. Shirley then explained the role of community health workers and asked Brown if she thought that service might be helpful.
''What you are describing is home health, isn't it?'' Brown said.
Home-health agencies dispatch nurses to do clinical work in patients' homes. But they are not obligated to take your phone calls at midnight or steer you away from eating fried food -- and you have to have insurance to get their care. Often for-profit services, they are also the hedge funds of the health care community: potentially lucrative, largely unregulated, producing bad results as often as good. Sanjay Basu, a physician and policy expert at the University of California, San Francisco, says that while he has seen some remarkable and devoted home-health agencies, ''if you're in it for a buck, you could have a terrible home agency and make a ton of money.'' Many towns in the delta have them -- yet the delta's problems persist. Why? Shirley offered that the hospitals need a third party trained to discern what exactly will help a patient, and that party must come from the patient's world: talk the same, share similar fears and frustrations and life experiences.
''Most home-health nurses build great relationships with their patients,'' Brown said.
''But there's a lot of distrust,'' Henderson-Camara said, leaning forward. ''We don't trust people who don't look like us. Having grown up in a very segregated community, I know this for a fact. You may think that you're in with that patient, but when you walk out that door, they will laugh and say, 'I just told her that so she'll stop asking me questions.' But if you live in that community and sister Edna tells you something, you say, 'Now, Edna,' and she will say, 'O.K., you got me.' And she'll tell you the truth. People do not trust people who do not look like them.''
''I don't feel that's a problem here,'' said Brown, who happens to be white. ''I may be way smoozed.''
''I think you're smoozed.''
The friction between them highlighted a problem beyond a distrust of outsiders: the fractured nature of American health care. It was easy to dismiss, or misconstrue, the health-house network as just another addition to a market glutted with for-profit businesses and nonprofit services looking to patch up the holes in -- or take advantage of -- the health care system. What Shirley and his colleagues saw the need for was something holistic and aggressive that would take root in the community, get into homes and alter the course of future generations, before obesity, say, or diabetes sets in. The Iranian system they admire is a preventive health care system. American health care is not preventive, and it's not a system.
The practice of community health workers going door to door has been applied everywhere from China to Mexico. According to Carl H. Rush of the University of Texas Institute of Health Policy, in the United States, community health workers have been used on a small scale for decades. More recently, he says, hospitals around the country are realizing the potential for community health workers to lower their costs.
The Iranian health houses, too, resemble the original mission of America's community health centers. When Dr. H. Jack Geiger founded the country's first federally qualified health center in 1967 in Mound Bayou, a small town in the delta, the goal was to confront the many aspects of people's lives that were contributing to their ill health. ''We built wells and privies and housing and started a 500-acre vegetable farm,'' says Geiger, whose work was inspired by what he saw in South Africa in the late '50s, ''and that probably had a bigger impact on the health of the population than what we were doing as doctors. The indigenous people we trained were among the most useful people on staff.''
Today there are 8,300 centers serving 20 million people throughout the country. Over the years, however, community health centers, needing to compete in the marketplace, have evolved into more conventional medical businesses, focused on the delivery of personal health services rather than the social and environmental determinants of overall health.
To help them return to the original mission, the Affordable Care Act will give $11 billion to community health centers, a sum that will double the numbers and capacity of centers nationwide. ''It would be effective if community health centers were given the budget to return to the interventions that characterized almost all of the first health centers of the 1960s and 1970s,'' Geiger says. ''Every health care provider in this country is under pressure, because of the incentives in the system, to churn out patients as fast as you can, because you get paid for visits. That just doesn't work for people with the kind of complex problems you probably saw in Mississippi. You can't fix these problems in 10 minutes.''
Shirley says he believes that the problems of the American poor -- living conditions, deficient education, harmful behaviors and the lack of family support and access to healthful lifestyles -- demand house calls. This approach was used by groups in Atlantic City and Camden, N.J., profiled by Atul Gawande in The New Yorker last year, which identified the worst offenders of emergency-room readmission and deployed social workers and nurses to figure out the myriad sources of ill health. What was clear above all else from Gawande's account is that what these people needed was constant attention. Because one stumble -- an unpaid electricity bill, for example -- can lead to cascading health setbacks.
The Iranian model goes a step further by making the community health workers responsible for their villagers' well-being from birth. It's an approach very much at odds with the American ethos of self-reliance. But in Iran, the seeming intrusiveness is required, according to Dr. Kamel Shadpour, one of the architects of the Iranian system. ''If you go to one of these community health workers and ask him or her how many people they cover, they won't tell you around 2,000,'' Shadpour says. ''They will tell you exactly 1,829 people. If you take out the family file with the No. 62, he or she will know which family that is, and she will tell you that the father is this old, and they have five children, their ages, their vaccinations, how they were doing family planning, everything.''
The Iranian model also differs from many others because of its integrated delivery network: the way a patient is referred up through a chain of hospitals according to their needs. ''The overall system is the key,'' says Miller, the Oxford consultant, ''not just community health workers.''
The American government has been moving toward more comprehensive solutions. The Affordable Care Act has created ''accountable care organizations'' that include doctors, social workers, nurses and pharmacists working together to serve patients. Since May, also as part of health care reform, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced more than 100 multimillion-dollar grants to organizations that proposed new ways to prevent illness and save money. Its Innovation Center awarded grants to a large number of experimental programs that involve community health workers.
''There's a renewed interest in them, in part because of the nation's increased focus on prevention,'' says Dr. Richard J. Gilfillan, the director of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation. ''Eighty-four percent of our health care dollar is spent on managing people with chronic conditions. . . . We know preventing obesity can help prevent other illnesses such as diabetes, hypertension and kidney disease -- so how can we prevent these conditions from occurring in the first place? Likely not with more procedures and X-rays. Some of the winners' programs harken back to the way health care was delivered long ago. The things we learn by going into someone's home tell us so much about the patient's life and how they manage their own diseases.''
One morning last spring, Shirley took me to see one of his new health-house facilities at Blackburn Middle School, which is on the edge of Jackson State University's campus and across the street from where Shirley grew up. Walking with him through the neighborhood, or stopping in with him at the Penguin, a nice restaurant on the Jackson State campus, is like being with the mayor. Over lunch, the people who came to shake his hand included the state's new director of Medicaid and the president of the Mississippi NAACP.
Shirley reasoned that opening health houses in the schools was a natural way to gain access to families. Many public schools in Mississippi don't have full-time nurses, and Blackburn Middle School is attended almost entirely by students who live in poverty, so it welcomed the chance to have health care on the premises.
One community health worker on the staff at Blackburn was Tiara, a single mother on Temporary Assistance for Needy Families I first met almost nine months earlier. A not-so-obvious benefit of training community health workers is that doing so creates jobs for unemployed people; advanced degrees are unnecessary. In our first interview, Tiara told me how much she loved her job. At Blackburn, she seemed quieter as we talked about how she counseled young girls about sex. ''As someone who had a child at 17, I am so against it,'' she told us. (She is now 22.) ''You have so much potential.''
As a HealthConnect employee, Tiara also made house calls before being transferred to work in the school. Her life is a kind of full-time HealthConnect anyway. ''I had'' -- she said, counting -- ''six people in my apartment last night. Because they don't have electricity. And one was a real bad diabetic who can't see how to pull her insulin, can't see anything.''
These are the sorts of stories you hear repeatedly in Mississippi. During five days driving around with Cox, I saw what health workers were up against, and what they were capable of. Cox comes from a middle-class family, the product of a stable home. She went to college, became a funeral director and then decided to go to nursing school, using public assistance to make her way through it. Cox had worked as a nurse for 20 years -- Shirley and the Central Mississippi Medical Center decided to use licensed nurses at HealthConnect until their community health workers are trained -- and she could intuit that a patient's life might be crumbling in surprising ways.
There was Regina Huggins, who had been in the hospital 20 times in eight months since her heart attack. She was a smoker with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who lacked energy and had lost 50 pounds. One of the reasons she kept calling ambulances to go to the E.R. seemed to be that she had no transportation; she couldn't even afford a taxi. She did not qualify for Medicaid. Without insurance, she couldn't get an oxygen tank or inhalers or fill her prescriptions. She had $300,000 in medical bills.
There was Mamie Marshall, who was dying of bone cancer in the back room of her house. None of her doctors had put her in hospice care, and she said she had been told that no one could do anything for her. She was a licensed beautician and had worked for Packard Electric, a subsidiary of General Motors, and as a public-school bus driver and as a nanny. ''I worked,'' she said.
And there were Carolyn Brewster and Melvin McGee, 29-year-olds whose baby, Justin, was born prematurely, most likely because Brewster had high blood pressure and pre-eclampsia. Both Brewster and McGee have learning disabilities, but they had jobs and had earnestly embraced parenthood, paying $450 a month for a two-room apartment in a motel-like apartment complex where everyone seemed to be under 30. When we called on them, Cox decided to take Brewster's blood pressure and discovered that it was 149 over 100. Brewster wasn't doing anything to reduce it except taking vinegar, a common home remedy. Cox made an appointment for her at the medical clinic later that day, told her how to catch the bus and which pharmacy to go to and emphasized that she needed to go right away. ''You are only 29, and you are going to end up on dialysis,'' she said.
On our way out, Cox said she wanted to stop by to see Tiara, who lives in the same apartment complex. She had just had her second child.
Shirley, Shahbazi and Miller haven't had an easy time getting large-scale financing for their health-house network. They enlisted a Mississippi congressman, Bennie Thompson, to write a letter to Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of Health and Human Services. They applied for (but did not receive) one of those grants awarded by the Innovation Center; Jack Geiger wrote the recommendation letter. They talked it up in Mississippi.
The three men -- and many Mississippians I spoke to -- complain that a lot of federal and grant money goes to research, not actual services. ''The delta people have been studied to death,'' Shirley says. Also, as they point out, funding rarely goes to entire systems. But the group is hoping that the idea of Iranian-style health houses in the United States might inspire good will between the two countries.
''If they can get the resources, then why not give it a try?'' said Shadpour, the architect of the Iranian system, when I called him in Tehran. ''The situation is not worse than Iran. To the contrary, it is much better in many ways. The infrastructure is there.''
Until someone finances the pilot for 15 health houses, Shirley will establish them in 11 schools -- where there are already rooms, electricity, water. To keep the houses running, Shirley says, they are staffed with certified nurse practitioners whose services can be billed to Medicaid. ''So the revenue that the nurse generates will go to paying her and the community health workers, too. We say, 'O.K., how much money is already out there?'
''The only outside money that we've gotten to contribute to our project has been $75,000 from United Healthcare, the insurance company, because they see the potential to save them money,'' he continued.
His methods are scrappy and scattershot, but Shirley is used to working around the system. After 60 years, perhaps the main reason he's turning to an Iranian model is because, unlike everything else in Mississippi, it worked. In one year, HealthConnect cut the rate of readmissions to the Central Mississippi Medical Center by 15 percent.
Meanwhile, Miller is trying to find yet another way to generate money. With support from Jackson State doctors and advice from their counterparts at Shiraz University, he has begun discussing the idea of Americans and Iranians working together to implement the Iranian model in other needy countries. He hopes that a major international aid project might be a way to get financing for Mississippi.
A few weeks after her first visit, Claudia Cox returned to Vonda Wells's house. Wells, who is now 41, hadn't returned to the emergency room, but she seemed sadder. She hadn't been paid the $5 a day she was supposed to get for working at the Christian community center, but despite doing all her paperwork and leaving messages for her caseworker, she had not heard back.
And because Medicaid limits the number of doctor visits in a year, she couldn't see one now.
''How you going to follow up with your pulmonologist and cardiologist?'' Cox asked.
''I had to cancel,'' Wells said. ''I already have a bill in there for $240 I have to pay.''
She couldn't keep up with her medicines. ''Medicaid can't pay for it, and I can't pay for the medicines, not at $90 a pop,'' she said. ''I try to wean myself off of medicine. If I feel good, I don't take them.''
But Wells spoke of positive things. Her 19-year-old daughter, who played in the next room with Wells's grandchild, was talented enough to be a fashion designer, she said. Her youngest daughter, 16, wanted to join the military ''to see the world.'' Her mother helped out with the bills at times. And her uncle had offered to come by and do some repairs, rip up the carpet, fix the kitchen. In many ways, Wells was rare among Cox's patients: she still had family.
In fact, the house had been her grandmother's, and she had spent some of her childhood there. She was lucky to have a rent-free home full of so many memories. But Wells would have to wait to learn whether that house was giving her asthma problems.
''We couldn't find anybody to examine the house'' that was affordable, Cox said. ''It was $1,300 for one day -- just to test. Just to come out here and pull a couple of pieces from the attic.''

HEADLINE: Changed By Wall St., For Wall St.

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
AND so Liborgate drags on and on and on.
Last week, two senior Washington officials -- Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, and Gary Gensler, the head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission -- testified before Congress about the scandal surrounding Libor, the benchmark for global interest rates.
No great revelations were forthcoming. 
As we await the full story, it's worth remembering how Libor, the London interbank offered rate, became the world standard to begin with.
You probably won't be shocked to learn that in mortgages, at least, Wall Street played a role in pushing Libor over another rate benchmark -- one that some bankers say was better for borrowers.
Before this scandal made headlines, few people outside of finance knew what Libor was. But according to the Center for Responsible Lending, half of the nation's adjustable-rate home mortgages are based on it. Since 2002, more than 12 million A.R.M.'s, worth $3.5 trillion, have been indexed to Libor, according to the center.
That's a lot of money resting on an interest rate that turns out to have been rigged.
But Libor didn't always determine the rate on A.R.M.'s. Back in the 1990s, a much less volatile benchmark -- the even more obscure-sounding 11th District Cost-of-Funds Index -- was the norm for these loans. It represented the average rate paid to depositors by savings and loans in the Western region of the United States. The Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco, known as the 11th District and home to some of the largest mortgage lenders, compiled the rate every month. It makes sense to base adjustable-rate mortgages on lenders' own costs of funds. That is because it links home loans' rates to the rate paid on bank deposits. It also has the merit of being a rate based on reality -- not, as in Libor's case, on some bankers' estimates.
John F. Maher, former chief executive of Great Western Bank, a large savings and loan that was later acquired, said that the old cost-of-funds index benefited borrowers.
''It is based on financial institutions' average cost of funds, which moves relatively sluggishly compared to a marginal cost of funds, which is what Libor would be more associated with,'' Mr. Maher said. ''The sluggish nature of the index was better for borrowers; it didn't have the risk for as much payment shock, because the payment changes moved so much more gradually.''
Because the cost-of-funds index tended to lag movements in prevailing interest rates, it didn't respond as quickly as more volatile benchmarks did when interest rates declined. Conversely, though, it didn't move up as fast, either. Even though some borrowers carped about this lag effect when rates fell, they ultimately reaped the benefits.
SO where does Wall Street come in? In the early to mid-1990s, as the home loan securitization machine got cranking, big brokerage firms looking to package and sell mortgage securities began pushing for a different index upon which A.R.M.'s could be based. The industry argued that it couldn't hedge its mortgage holdings because there were no other securities based on the 11th District Cost-of-Funds Index. Libor, a more volatile index, appealed to traders as well.
''The volatile index was to respond to the needs of the secondary mortgage market, the guys who packaged the securities and the fellows who traded them,'' Mr. Maher said.
By the late 1990s, the push for Libor became even more pronounced as brokerage firms sought overseas investors for their mortgage securities. Selling these instruments to foreign buyers would be far easier, the firms argued, if those instruments were tied to a well-known global benchmark.
''It was all about securitization, especially subprime loans,'' said Guy D. Cecala, publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance, an industry authority. ''You had Wall Street saying, 'If we want to sell this overseas, we have to pick a more international-flavored index.' Subprime lenders just started using it overnight, and then it started to spill out into any loan you wanted to securitize.''
As Libor became the dominant index for consumer loans in securitizations, the 11th District Cost-of-Funds Index fell into obscurity. Consolidation in the savings and loan industry also took its toll. In 1991, according to the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco, the cost-of-funds index was based on costs incurred by 153 institutions. By 2001, only 49 institutions contributed to the index. As of last January, that number had dwindled to 17.
As it turned out, payment shock was the least of the problems faced by borrowers with Libor-based mortgages. Loans with unnaturally low teaser rates that expired relatively quickly were more responsible for borrower defaults and foreclosures.
It also appears that the rigging of the Libor by Barclays and others during the financial crisis may have benefited borrowers by pushing the rate lower than it otherwise would have been.
But it is interesting, if not surprising, that the dominant benchmark tied to A.R.M.'s was changed by Wall Street, for Wall Street. Now that we know Libor can and has been manipulated, it makes this shift all the more intriguing. After all, the 11th District Cost-of-Funds Index was a number published by the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco, not a figure calculated by bankers.
TESTIFYING before the House Agriculture Committee last week about the Libor, Mr. Gensler, the head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, summed things up pretty well.
''If these key benchmarks are based on observable transactions, borrowers, lenders and derivatives users around the globe all benefit,'' he said. If these key benchmarks are not based on observable transactions, I believe their integrity will continue to be subject to question.''
With trillions of dollars hanging in the balance, integrity could not be more important.

HEADLINE: Taxes Needn't Discourage Philanthropy

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. SHILLER. 
Robert J. Shiller is professor of economics and finance at Yale.

 BODY:
HOW high can taxes go? In 1944, the federal personal income tax rate reached 94 percent.
You might expect that such a high rate would lead to economic disaster or class warfare -- or both. But it didn't. Despite it, people prospered back then, and at least in some respects, American society was harmonious.
World War II was raging, and perhaps because of it, people seemed to be more giving, while the government more actively encouraged altruistic acts. There are important lessons to be learned from that time.
Here are some of the facts: The government imposed that 94 percent rate on income above $200,000. President Franklin D. Roosevelt said in May 1940, even before the United States entered the war, that not a single war millionaire should be created, and by 1944 Congress essentially gave him the taxes he said he needed to head off the possibility. 
The tax rate shifted after the war, but not by much. In fact, it remained extremely high for a very long time. In 1963, the top rate was 91 percent, but then it would be cut sharply, to 70 percent by 1965.
It is often argued today that high tax rates kill economic incentives, deterring talented business leaders from working as hard or taking as much risk. But how did the country fare during those years of super-high rates?
The growth of real gross domestic product was actually exceptionally strong. Using the years from 1948 to 1963, a period that omits wartime distortions, real G.D.P. grew 3.7 percent a year, on average, versus an overall 3.2 percent a year from 1929 to 2011.
There are many reasons for that, of course. But one factor was surely the high degree of social harmony of those 15 years. Many people sacrificed their lives during the war, and, for a while, it seemed that the survivors were especially charitable to one another, on both a personal and an institutional level.
It's natural for people to feel kind and generous toward those they perceive as behaving kindly and generously toward them. Unfortunately, the contrary is also often true: people tend to be vengeful toward those they believe have harmed them. Social psychologists and game theorists call this trait reciprocity.
Today, the top tax-bracket rate is only 35 percent (though it may go up slightly if the Bush-era tax cuts are allowed to expire at year-end). But what if we someday need to respond to another great national emergency, or even to a gradual crisis of worsening income inequality? We may again have to raise the top rates substantially -- though I hope to much less than 94 percent!
First, we should think clearly about how capitalism worked under much higher rates for upper-income taxpayers. The tax burden wasn't quite as heavy as it might seem. The highest rate in 1944 applied only to income one earned over $200,000, which is about $2.6 million in today's dollars. Also, there were ways to avoid part of the burden -- by means such as employers' giving employees untaxed perquisites or by paying them in underpriced stock instead of cash.
Still, for very high earned incomes, the bulk of the taxes couldn't be easily avoided. And people worried, then as now, that excessive taxation would eventually kill incentives for business.
In response, the government thought of creative ways to keep the incentives for high-income people alive, by letting them be philanthropists with much of their before-tax income. Notably, the maximum deduction for charitable contributions was raised from 15 percent of income in 1944 to 20 percent in 1953, to 30 percent in 1954, and then, with some qualifications, to 100 percent in 1956. (The maximum today is 50 percent.)
Because the long-term capital gains rate plus the income tax rate exceeded 100 percent, people in top brackets found that it was actually better, from a purely selfish viewpoint, to give highly appreciated assets to charity and take the deduction -- and many did just that.
Some of these people were viewed as using the charitable deduction to avoid most of their taxes, So some philanthropy began to look like just a cynical tax dodge. That bad reputation still sticks somewhat today, though today's tax rates no longer permit making a profit by giving away assets. Governments should encourage philanthropy but not go that far: a gift must be a real gift.
SHOULD charitable deductions be fundamental to financial capitalism? I argue so in my book, ''Finance and the Good Society'' (Princeton, 2012). We need to accompany any tax increases with an affirmation and a broadening of the tax system's support of philanthropy.
After a big tax increase on high incomes, people should have an especially strong incentive to give money to good causes: to the needy and to schools, colleges, hospitals, churches, the arts and other purposes. Many such donations reduce the need for government spending, so the deduction isn't terribly costly to the government. It is also likely to bring entrepreneurial creativity to such causes.
Of course, there are counterarguments: that few people are motivated to work for money that will largely have to be given away, and that it's natural for people to want to make their families better off from their earnings. But there is an answer to that line of thinking: after one attains a certain level of comfort, greater wealth arguably contributes only to social status, which philanthropy certainly bolsters.
That's a good reason for national policies that encourage philanthropy. Although it's natural for people to want high social status, there are ways for high achievers to reach the same relative rank without so much wasteful conspicuous consumption, as Thorstein Veblen emphasized in his 1899 book, ''The Theory of the Leisure Class.'' (Robert H. Frank, my fellow Economic View columnist, has carried Veblen's torch into the 21st century, most recently in his 2011 book, ''The Darwin Economy.'')
We already have a system to encourage philanthropy. It includes the charitable deduction, and ways for high-income people to set up their own philanthropic foundations, receiving a tax deduction each year as they donate. There are also donor-advised funds that are suitable for people with more modest incomes.
Unfortunately, much talk today focuses on just the opposite idea: curtailing the charitable deduction for high-income people, in order to help close the federal deficit. While the Bowles-Simpson bipartisan fiscal commission had a number of good ideas, it proposed cuts in incentives for high-income people to give. And President Obama again proposed cuts to the charitable deduction in his 2013 budget proposal.
Amid rising concern about inequality, we should focus on how we can improve our tax code and other rules to encourage positive feelings of reciprocity in our society. And we can do it while still giving people incentives to innovate -- and to keep working hard.

HEADLINE: Waste Project Is Abandoned Following Protests in China

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ; Bree Feng contributed research.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- Angry demonstrators entered a government office in the port city of Qidong, near Shanghai, on Saturday and smashed computers and destroyed furniture to protest a waste discharge plant that they said would pollute the water supply. 
In reaction, the local government Web site said Saturday that plans for the discharge plant, which was to be part of a paper manufacturing plant, had been abandoned.
China's authorities face a mounting pattern of protests against pollution, and in particular, against industrial plants that locals can single out during the planning stage or in the early days of construction.
This month, protesters in the southern town of Shifang in Sichuan Province forced the local government to abandon plans to build a copper refinery after complaints that the waste would contaminate the water supply and pollute the air. In Shifang, the police used tear gas against protesters.
In the northeastern city of Dalian, the authorities were forced to call off the construction of a petrochemical plant last year after demonstrators said it threatened public health.
In Qidong on Saturday, Reuters reported that about 1,000 protesters marched through the city and that two police officers were badly beaten by demonstrators.
The city sits on the mouth of the Yangtze River, and the local authorities have attracted pharmaceutical companies, chemical fertilizer plants and computer parts factories with tax breaks and other enticements.
The city is part of the vast Yangtze Delta region that has been an engine of China's manufacturing power in the past decade.
Last year, Qidong was connected to Shanghai by a nearly 40-mile-long bridge, making the local economic enterprise zone, established by the local government to attract business, even more appealing to investors.
One of the most profitable industries in Qidong is the exporting of fish, including processed lobster and shrimp, to the United States. The city boasts freezers certified by the European Union for the export of fish to Europe.
Some of the protesters argued that the wastewater plant would discharge effluent into the sea and harm the fishing industry. But most seemed to be concerned about drinking water.
At an upscale computer store, an employee reached by telephone said most people were worried about how the discharge from the paper plant would affect the water supply.
''The protesters are angry because the pipeline project will affect our water supplies,'' she said. ''I'm against the project, too.''
The owner of a drugstore reached by telephone said: ''Everybody from the old to the young are against this project. Qidong people are hard-working people. Why should they have the project here?''
The owner, an elderly woman, said local residents were not consulted about the paper plant or its discharge facilities. ''All we know is that somebody from the higher levels decided it's to be in Qidong,'' she said.
Several people reached by telephone said the local government sent text messages to residents and storekeepers on Friday night and Saturday asking them not to participate in the demonstration.

HEADLINE: Hardly Working, and the Airport Mix-Up

 BODY:
In last Sunday's Big City column, Ginia Bellafante wrote about the city's high unemployment rate and the difficulty of making ends meet with a job near the minimum wage. Readers responded on NYTimes.com.
They also commented on an article by Sarah Maslin Nir about New York City airport mix-ups -- heading to, for example, La Guardia when one's flight leaves from Kennedy. A selection of responses is below.
Also below is a reader's letter in response to a July 15 article by Ms. Nir about the atmosphere on weekend trains to the Hamptons. 
The way ''regular people'' are treated in the work force is shameful. People WANT to work, want to pay their own way -- this is not a city (nor a country) of slackers and laggards.
As to the City Council sitting on legislation that would require paid sick days: I follow how the Council members vote (or don't) on matters like this. And when it is MY turn to vote in the next elections, I will be VERY clear about who on the Council deserves my vote and who does not.
L,
NYC
Yes, more unions so we can have more tales of woe of people who can't find jobs. Incredibly, it appears that the author of the article bemoans the fact that there is a spike in knowledge worker jobs including software engineering jobs in NYC! The fact is the liberal elite in this city are not interested in jobs for its citizens, especially for entry level or manual variety, but dependency on a bloated government bureaucracy paid by who knows who.
Julio Hernandez-Miyares,
New York
I put the blame squarely on the excesses of Wall Street. Exorbitant real estate prices, a palpable sense of pure materialism and greed, a sense that things like integrity, honor, kindness and a realization of our shared humanity have fallen by the wayside in the frenzied rush to claw to the top of the income ladder. But I try to remain optimistic; WS is changing and shrinking, as it should. I hope that this will restore a sense of balance to life here in the city.
Olivia,
New York
While the writer examines the difficulties faced by working-class folks, which are severe, even middle-class folks are suffering (in a different way). Under Bberg, NYC has RAPIDLY changed from a city for all to a city for the 1 percent.
My husband and I recently had to leave the beloved city because our combined income (which was actually a LOT compared to most) did not afford us to do three important things: 1) live in a district where schools were good and there was access to healthy foods, 2) save for our retirements/college for kids, 3) visit our families so our parents could maintain relationships with their grandchildren.
It breaks my heart, no, absolutely shatters my heart that I cannot raise my kids in the beloved city where they will interact with people from all over the globe.
Then I stop and think: maybe all those amazing people who make NYC what it is will no longer be there, as well.

The Wrong Airport
Oh, for serious, people.
Are Americans really so irresponsible that they can't even figure out which airport they are going to?
Stop living in a fog and start paying attention to what is two feet in front of your face.
I really have no sympathy for anyone who this happens to. Plan ahead, pay attention, act intentionally.
Just doing these three simple things, not only when traveling but in general, will result in a highly functional and successful life.

When I was 19, I met this recent college graduate. We hit it off and started dating during the short period of time he was in town visiting his brother. Shortly after I turned 20, he started a graduate program in Texas and invited me out for a two-week visit. I had some money saved, bought a round-trip ticket to Houston and soon found myself there in the airport, all alone.
It was 1980, and a mobile phone did not exist. I waited by the baggage claim, getting nervous and starting to wonder how I was going to go about getting back to my parents' home hundreds of miles away. The worry was keeping my disappointment and anger off in the distance, for the time being, of falling for a guy who stood me up and left me stranded.
Suddenly, the queasy slew of emotions churning within me turned into happy excitement when a tap on my shoulder caused me to turn and see my boyfriend standing there. He had driven to the other Houston airport about an hour away, not realizing his mistake until shortly before my flight arrived.
That was 32 years ago, and we just celebrated our 27th wedding anniversary!

The idea that it could take THREE public transit legs (combination of bus+subway) and 90 minutes to go 12 miles from La Guardia to JFK is insane. C'mon, M.T.A.!

Your article evoked far happier memories, at least to this old geezer, than the Long Island Rail Road's crammed, drunken weekend trips to the Hamptons of today.
My family's older generations rented a palatial home on Shelter Island for several years in 1938-41. We would embark in the L.I.R.R. ''Cannonball'' at Penn Station, which attached three Pullman cars to, say, 10 coach cars. These cars were clearly marked ''Pennsylvania Railroad'' in their then-familiar buff red colors.
We embarked at Penn Station, in a drawing room and adjoining bedroom, configured with daytime seating to accommodate us all, had a very tasty lunch in the dining car, with the men drinking at the bar, then made ourselves comfortable in the drawing room-bedroom compartments. An auto ferry conveyed us to Shelter Island.
I have many memories of these summers, a few as a naughty little boy, and some enlightening.
The most memorable moment, however, was when I woke up and went downstairs to see all the grown-ups scanning The New York Times's headline: ''Germany Invades Russia.''
It was, I recall, June 22,1941.

HEADLINE: Giant Stocks Are Walking Tall Again

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a senior editor at Money magazine.

 BODY:
STOCKS around the world have been struggling lately, but one group of equities may ultimately benefit from all the fear and uncertainty: so-called megacaps.
Ever since worries over the European debt crisis began to escalate more than a year and a half ago, the biggest American blue-chip stocks have been among the few bright spots for investors.
Since the start of last year, the Russell Top 50 index of the largest-capitalization domestic stocks has climbed more than 14 percent, while the MSCI EAFE index of foreign equities has sunk more than 15 percent and the Russell 2000 index of small-company shares has gained just 1 percent. Tack on dividends and megacap stocks have returned more than 18 percent during a period of heightened volatility and fear on Wall Street. 
These giant stocks, with a market capitalization of around $50 billion or higher, managed to avoid losses in what's been a tough month for many smaller stocks. The megacaps are up around 2 percent in July, while small-cap stocks are off nearly 1 percent.
Because of their size and industry dominance, megacaps have traditionally been seen as a relatively stable spot for equity investors. But their recent outperformance was a notable turnaround for a group that had generally been out of favor since the late 1990s, when shares of giant companies like Microsoft and Cisco Systems dominated the market before the growth stock bubble burst in 2000.
Some strategists say this could be an early sign of the market's gradual shift back toward big stocks after years of favoring small-company and even international equities.
''Large caps may finally be having their day in the sun,'' said Jack A. Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank.
Mr. Ablin added that while equities are still slogging through a rough patch, a number of factors are weighing in the favor of large-cap stocks in general right now. ''One is their stability,'' he said, ''but there's also their dividends.''
The 50 megacap stocks, most of which pay dividends, have an average yield of 2.2 percent, which compares favorably with the 1.6 percent average payout of small-company stocks and the 1.5 percent yield on 10-year Treasury notes.
The recent turmoil in Europe may be indirectly helping the megacaps in other ways. For starters, as global investors have been fleeing the euro, they've been driving money into dollar-denominated assets like Treasuries. That has bolstered the value of the dollar, which is up 13 percent since April 2011.
''Basically, people have been looking to escape Europe, and those who want to keep their money in equities are probably seeking the safer shores of megacaps in the United States,'' said Sam Stovall, chief equity strategist at S.& P. Capital IQ.
The strengthening dollar has also focused American investors' attention back on the domestic market. When the dollar was falling for much of the last decade, Americans could make money on their foreign investments simply through the currency fluctuation.
From January 2002 to April 2011, the dollar lost 39 percent of its value against a basket of foreign currencies. During that stretch, European stocks sank 6.5 percent when measured in the local currency. But because of the sinking dollar, Americans actually saw their European shares soar 61 percent.
Now that the dollar has reversed course and is gaining ground, American investors have less desire to invest abroad and more reason to keep their money in domestic shares.
But aren't megacap stocks also exposed to foreign markets?
Yes. The average large company generates more than 46 percent of its revenue abroad, versus just 31 percent for small companies, according to S.& P.
Yet megacaps have generally done well anyway. ''Bigger businesses, in particular since the financial crisis, have clearly proven to be more adaptable than a lot of people thought,'' said Keith Trauner, co-portfolio manager of the GoodHaven Fund, which invests in a mix of big and small stocks. ''They've been able to reduce costs and adjust their expense structure better than most people would have imagined.''
Mr. Trauner's fund has beaten 75 percent of its peers in the last year, thanks in part to big stakes in megacaps like Microsoft and Wal-Mart. He added that some investors were probably still overlooking this group because many megacaps were ''dead money'' for more than a decade.
From 2000 through 2010, for instance, Microsoft lost 4.6 percent while Wal-Mart sank 1 percent, both annualized.
Wallace Weitz, president of the Weitz Funds, said, ''I've been doing this for more than 40 years, yet it still surprises me that people look away from good companies because they 'haven't done anything' for a long time.''
That's exactly where value-minded investors ought to be looking for attractively priced shares, he said.
MEGACAP stocks, which in 2000 had a frothy price-to-earnings ratio of 33, are now trading at 13 times estimated earnings. By comparison, shares of medium-size companies have an average P/E ratio of 16, while the figure for small companies is nearly 20.
''It's a question of what risk you want to take,'' said Pat W. Dorsey, president and director of research and strategy at Sanibel Captiva Investment Advisers. Investors fearful of stocks with any European exposure may be wary of megacaps. But in such times, skittish investors are also prone to punish stocks with high P/E ratios.
Mr. Dorsey says many megacap are cheaply priced -- and they appeal to him. ''I would prefer to take less valuation risk,'' he said.

HEADLINE: The Short Life and Lonely Death of Sabrina Seelig

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS

 BODY:
SABRINA SEELIG seemed too young to die.
Just 22, she lived in a railroad flat in Bushwick, a part of Brooklyn that at the time was cheap but not yet hip, with a roommate who worked at the Museum of Modern Art. Ms. Seelig worked as a waitress in bistros on the Lower East Side while writing a novel and studying classics at Hunter College.
One night she stayed up all night translating a Latin text into English for a college paper. At 4 a.m. she e-mailed her professor saying she would deliver it in person. During the all-nighter, Ms. Seelig took Ephedra, a stimulant diet drug that had been banned by the Food and Drug Administration three years earlier, and had a few beers. When she felt sick, she called Poison Control for help, and spoke very clearly, a recording of the call shows. She arrived by ambulance at Wyckoff Heights Medical Center, long regarded as one of the most troubled hospitals in the city, at 11:05 a.m. on May 30, 2007, conscious and alert but complaining of vomiting and dizziness. 
She was given a sedative that put her into a deep sleep, and her wrists were tied to the bed. None of her friends or relatives knew that she was there, and medical records show no measurements of her vital signs for hours that afternoon, suggesting that she was left unattended by the medical staff.
By that evening she was brain damaged and on life support, with little hope of recovering. She died six days later.
Ms. Seelig's case brings to mind the death of Libby Zion, an 18-year-old Bennington College freshman who died in 1984, eight hours after being admitted to New York Hospital, where she had been sedated and tied down. Ms. Zion's death led to changes in the training of young doctors across the country, in a campaign led by her father, Sidney Zion, a well-connected New York writer.
But Ms. Seelig's grieving parents, Warren Seelig and Sherrie Gibson, carried on their crusade in private -- and without the satisfaction of knowing that her death had changed the way medicine was practiced.
How could a 22-year-old woman die so abruptly? How could a youthful misstep have had such disastrous consequences? Those are questions the Seeligs still struggle to answer after five years. Because their daughter was alone at the hospital, they are left with only a sketchy record of her treatment and no way to know what she felt during her final hours. Her mother and her estate sued Wyckoff Hospital and staff members who had treated Ms. Seelig for malpractice, but they lost after an emotionally grueling four-week trial in the spring.
Asked what her daughter's biggest mistake might have been, Ms. Gibson said it was being young, carefree, adventurous and trusting.
''She had a wonderful innocent quality about her,'' said her friend Erin Durant, an aspiring songwriter who worked as a waitress with Ms. Seelig. ''I don't mean that in a naive way -- that's a terrible word to use, innocent, but she was very, like, kind but real.''
SABRINA was the younger of two sisters, and when she was little, her family lived in Philadelphia, where her parents taught at the University of the Arts. When she was 11, they moved to Rockland, Maine, a lobster town and artists' colony. She and her sister, Ashley, went skinny-dipping in the granite quarries. Their mother designed and sold clothing. Their father taught art and made ethereal sculptural forms that have been installed at places like the Pennsylvania Convention Center and the new American Embassy in Monrovia, Liberia.
When she was 13, she wanted to start an ice cream stand. Her father helped her build it, and they named it Lulu's, after their dog. The stand became a real business, a local phenomenon, and her sister still runs it today, with a small altar to Sabrina. ''It has an authenticity about it, and Sabrina loved that kind of thing,'' Mr. Seelig said. ''She is an old soul,'' he added, speaking of his younger daughter, still, in the present tense.
As a teenager, she directed plays, and her best friend, Caitlin FitzGerald, now an actress, starred in them. She graduated from high school a year early, in 2001, and took time off to travel before spending two years at Hampshire College in Amherst, Mass., attracted by its reputation for creativity. Then, restless again, she moved to New York, where her sister was in art school.
Ms. Seelig found an apartment at 70 St. Nicholas Avenue, five blocks from Wyckoff Hospital, and filled it with inspirational quotations from literature, shells from Maine and two paintings by her sister -- ''the only ones she ever liked,'' Ashley said, adding, ''It was, like, extremely bohemian, like, oh, come on.''
She drank Earl Grey tea with steamed milk, and wore flowing thrift-shop dresses.
Ms. Durant took her to the office of The Brooklyn Rail, a free, nonprofit journal of arts and politics based in Greenpoint, in a building just over the Pulaski Bridge from Long Island City, Queens, on a street so desolate it belongs in film noir. For Ms. Seelig, it was a sanctuary, almost like going home.
The Rail's publisher, Phong Bui, would let her visit in the middle of the night, after a shift as a waitress, so she could have a quiet place to write. ''She would bring a bottle of wine or make coffee, depending on her mood,'' he said.
To David Varno, then The Rail's production editor, now getting a master's degree in creative writing at Columbia, it felt like a salon. ''We would read books, talk about Walter Benjamin's 'Illuminations,' Dore Ashton's 'New York School,' '' Mr. Varno said.
He went to her apartment for a couple of parties and saw her for the first time surrounded by her friends from Hampshire College, worldly, sophisticated and promising.
''They were all wearing these kind of fancy party dresses,'' he said. ''I felt almost out of my element, but also happy to see that side of her, to see her in a more festive atmosphere.''
Waiting on tables at the Pink Pony, on the Lower East Side, she met a regular customer, Jan Baracz, a Poland-born artist who was 25 years older than she was, and they started dating.
ON May 29, the day after Memorial Day, Ms. Seelig worked the dinner shift at Tree, a new restaurant in the East Village started by Colm Clancy, an Irish immigrant who had talked her into working for him.
She told Mr. Baracz that she could not see him because she had to go home to Bushwick to write her Latin paper. When her roommate, Colin Barry, left for work around 8 a.m. the next day, she was still at the kitchen table, papers spread out around her.
About 10:45 a.m., she called 911.
''I, I, I think I'm poisoned,'' she says on the recording of the call, which was provided to her parents after her death.
''I think after taking Ephedra, I looked online but I took Valerian, which is maybe poison, but I am having a hard time,'' she went on. Valerian is an herbal sleep remedy, which some toxicologists believe is a kind of placebo, with no medicinal qualities.
She added, ''I've been vomiting for the past while, and my limbs feel heavy.''
She hesitated only when asked her age. ''Ah, 20-, 22, 23, no!'' she cried. To her family, her confusion was understandable. Her birthday was two weeks away, on June 15.
The dispatcher asked if her door was unlocked, and she said she would go downstairs and unlock it.
When the ambulance did not come right away, she called the health department's Poison Control Center.
The Poison Control operator, a woman, told her to sit down and wait for the ambulance.
Ms. Seelig: When will they come?
Poison Control: When did you call them?
Ms. Seelig: I don't know. A while ago.
The operator, who seemed to be putting her off, asked if she could call a friend.
Ms. Seelig: I can, I did; they didn't answer.
Poison Control: Your mom?
Ms. Seelig: No. My mom is in a different state. I don't think it will help.
Poison Control, dismissively: Well maybe you could just talk to her for right now until the ambulance comes.
Ms. Seelig: O.K.
Poison Control: O.K. All right. Bye.
As the woman hung up and the line clicked, Sabrina could still be heard saying, ''But help ...''
THE missed calls are part of the legacy of guilt and regret.
Before going to the hospital, Ms. Seelig called Mr. Baracz and a friend, Rebecca Green, but they did not pick up. She left no messages.
''Sometimes I think I have vibes,'' her mother said. ''But I definitely had no vibes that morning or that day that anything was wrong. It just came out of the blue.''
None of her friends had any inkling that anything was wrong until that night, when Ms. Seelig was supposed to host a dinner party. That afternoon, Mr. Baracz began calling about the menu. When she did not answer by 6 p.m., he sent a friend, Joanna Spinks, who lived around the corner, to look for her. The door to her apartment was unlocked and her laptop was on her bed, showing the Poison Control Web site. By calling 311, Mr. Baracz tracked her down at Wyckoff.
Ms. Spinks got to the hospital first, around 8 p.m., and then was joined by Ms. Green. They found Ms. Seelig in a small bed with a curtain around it. ''She was there unconscious with all the tubes in her,'' Ms. Spinks said.
Her face looked normal, as if she were sleeping. ''We were cutting up, like 'Earth to Sabrina,' '' at her bedside, Ms. Green said, aghast at the memory.
Quickly, the guests from the canceled dinner party converged on the hospital.
Mr. Baracz, now 53, remembers asking a nurse what had happened. ''You know what happened,'' she replied.
''Every hour they gave us a new explanation of what was happening,'' Ms. Green said. ''When she was still asleep at 5 a.m., we knew something was wrong.''
Mr. Baracz called Ms. Seelig's mother, who remembers being told by hospital staff that she should not rush to New York, that her daughter would come out of it by morning. Ignoring that advice, she and Mr. Seelig drove two hours to the airport in Portland that night and got to the hospital Thursday morning, where they were told that a constellation of specialists was being consulted.
Frustrated by a lack of clarity, Ms. Seelig's parents had her transferred to the Weill Cornell campus of NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan that evening; there, doctors tried a cooling therapy. Her friends held hands and sang. But it was too late. On June 4, 2007, Sabrina Seelig was declared brain-dead, and she was taken off life support the next day.
Ms. Seelig was an organ donor, so by the time of the autopsy, her body had already been carved up. The medical examiner concluded that she had died of ''water intoxication,'' which usually means becoming overloaded with water without enough salt.
NO one is left to tell what Ms. Seelig was thinking or feeling before she died. The medical record, a jumble of handwritten notes, offers the only insight into her death. It came out over four weeks in May this year, at the trial for malpractice.
In 2007, when Ms. Seelig was a patient, the state ordered Wyckoff to hire a management consultant to improve its governance and finances. Five years later, it is still struggling. The Brooklyn district attorney has been investigating allegations of mismanagement. A three-month investigation by The New York Times, the results of which were published in March, found a history of insider dealing and positions being given to people with political ties. The hospital officials involved denied any wrongdoing. The hospital does not carry malpractice insurance.
In a pretrial deposition, an emergency-room doctor, Dali Mardach, remembered asking Ms. Seelig, ''What's a nice-looking girl like you doing in Brooklyn?''
Dr. Mardach gave her two anti-nausea drugs, Phenergan and Tigan, which experts said can be sedating. As Ms. Seelig thrashed on the stretcher, Dr. Mardach ordered two doses of Ativan, a strong sedative, given intravenously at 1:15 and 1:45 p.m., for a total of four milligrams. She also ordered wrist restraints so that Ms. Seelig would not rip out her IV or hurt herself.
Much of the trial was a blur of technical detail. There was conflicting testimony as to whether Ms. Seelig was ever given oxygen. Her first blood test, which showed she was low on salt, was compromised; another test was not performed for hours. She was put in the care of a junior physician in training, Sameer Kaul, who found that she was ''barely arousable.'' Dr. Mardach and the nurse, Joyce Smith, disagreed about which of them had found her when she crashed.
Most telling, all the witnesses agreed that there were no new vital signs entered in her chart for more than three hours, from 2:35 to 6:10 p.m., when she was found in a holding or overflow area with a racing heartbeat and foaming at the mouth. Ms. Smith said she had been watching Ms. Seelig's cardiac monitor constantly, so there was no need to write down her vital signs.
The plaintiffs' expert, Dr. Kelly Johnson-Arbor, argued that Ms. Seelig had been ignored while she suffered an agonizing death of hypoxia, or lack of oxygen, which if she were awake would have led to a feeling of being ''suffocated,'' from the combined effects of the sedative drugs she had been given.
The defense argued that she had had a heart attack brought on by taking at least three Ephedra pills and whatever other drugs she might have taken. (The chart notes that she was ''known'' to take Focalin, an attention-deficit disorder drug commonly abused by college students to study.)
Late in the trial, as the plaintiffs' lawyer, Alan Fuchsberg, realized that it was going badly, he tried to suggest that the low salt level cited by the medical examiner should have been urgently treated, but a defense objection was sustained.
Dr. Johnson-Arbor stood alone against three defense experts, one for Dr. Mardach, one for the nurse and one for the hospital and its intern, Dr. Kaul. She was hugely pregnant; they were all middle-aged men in suits.
In his closing, the hospital's lawyer, Michael B. Lehrman, blamed Ms. Seelig for bringing about her own death with whatever cocktail of drugs she had taken. ''You heard how confused she was,'' he said. ''She couldn't even say her age. She was already in the process at that point of dying.''
After a day and a half of deliberations, the jury of four men and two women returned its verdict: Wyckoff and the individuals working there had not been negligent.
The jury did not seem to identify with Ms. Seelig.
One juror, Marat Leychik, 23, an unemployed graduate of John Jay College of Criminal Justice who lives with his parents in Coney Island, said he had never had to use any stimulants, not even caffeine, to write a paper. ''She, in my opinion, overexerted herself,'' he said.
Another juror, Irene Katzos, 39, a homemaker turned breadwinner from Bay Ridge, said that unlike Ms. Seelig she was ''not artsy.'' When the Poison Control call was played, Ms. Katzos saw tears streaming down the face of Ms. Seelig's father, who was hearing the recording for the first time. ''I swore I would never look over there again,'' she said.
After the trial, Dr. Eric D. Manheimer, former medical director of Bellevue Hospital Center in Manhattan, where he oversaw one of the busiest and most highly regarded emergency rooms in the country, reviewed Ms. Seelig's chart at the request of The Times and concluded that she had not been properly monitored.
As a precaution, doctors should have put a tube in her airway to keep her from breathing her own vomit and stomach acid and to provide oxygen, he said. And they should have moved her to intensive care. Her low salt could have been an additional ''metabolic cause of stupor and coma,'' he said.
''It's not rocket science,'' Dr. Manheimer said. ''Once your mental status is going down, you don't know when the person is going to stop breathing.''
Ms. Seelig's parents are left with a July 2007 letter of condolence from Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, then New York City's health commissioner, whose office turned over the Poison Control recording.
''I wept after hearing the recording,'' Dr. Frieden, now head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, wrote.
''As a parent, physician and fellow human being, I was deeply disturbed by the interaction of the Poison Control Center with your daughter,'' he wrote. Dr. Frieden said that the person who took the call ''no longer works for the Poison Control Center,'' and that he was working on better coordination with 911.
For Mr. Seelig and Ms. Gibson, the letter serves as evidence that their daughter's death did matter to someone, and made some difference.
Asked what lesson might be taught by Sabrina's death, Ms. Gibson said there was one. ''No one should go to a hospital without someone with you -- no one,'' she said. ''Don't go unless somebody at least knows you're there.''

To the Editor:
In ''Only the First Step in Containing Health Costs'' (Economic View, July 22), Christina D. Romer said that when employers give workers generous health insurance policies, this ''may lead families to be less vigilant consumers of health care.'' But it may also prevent them from forgoing health care they really need.
Which side will a humane society err on: unnecessary health expenditures or avoidable illnesses and deaths? The answer should be obvious.

HEADLINE: Nuns Weigh Response to Scathing Vatican Rebuke

BYLINE: By LAURIE GOODSTEIN

 BODY:
American nuns are preparing to assemble in St. Louis next week for a pivotal meeting at which they will try to decide how to respond to a scathing critique of their doctrinal loyalty issued this spring by the Vatican -- a report that has prompted Roman Catholics across the country to rally to the nuns' defense.
The nuns will be weighing whether to cooperate with the three bishops appointed by the Vatican to supervise the overhaul of their organization, the Leadership Conference of Women Religious, which represents about 80 percent of women's Catholic religious orders in the United States.
The Leadership Conference says it is considering at least six options that range from submitting graciously to the takeover to forming a new organization independent of Vatican control, as well other possible courses of action that lie between those poles. 
What is in essence a power struggle between the nuns and the church's hierarchy had been building for decades, church scholars say. At issue are questions of obedience and autonomy, what it means to be a faithful Catholic and different understandings of the Second Vatican Council.
Sister Pat Farrell, the president of the Leadership Conference, said in an interview that the Vatican seems to regard questioning as defiance, while the sisters see it as a form of faithfulness.
''We have a differing perspective on obedience,'' Sister Farrell said. ''Our understanding is that we need to continue to respond to the signs of the times, and the new questions and issues that arise in the complexities of modern life are not something we see as a threat.''
These same conflicts are gripping the Catholic Church at large. Nearly 50 years after the start of Vatican II, which was intended to open the church to the modern world and respond to the ''signs of the times,'' the church is gravely polarized between a progressive wing still eager for change and reform and a traditionalist flank focused on returning to what it sees as doctrinal fundamentals.
The sisters have been caught in the riptide. Most of them have spent their lives serving the sick, the poor, children and immigrants -- and not engaged in battles over theology. But when some sisters after Vatican II began to question church prohibitions on women serving as priests, artificial birth control or the acceptance of same-sex relationships, their religious orders did not shut down such discussion or treat it as apostasy. In fact, they have continued to insist on their right to debate and challenge church teaching, which has resulted in the Vatican's reproof.
The former head of the church's doctrinal office, Cardinal William J. Levada, said after his last meeting with the nuns' leaders in June, just before he retired, that they should regard his office's harsh assessment as ''an invitation to obedience.''
''I admire religious men and women,'' Cardinal Levada said in an interview with The National Catholic Reporter. ''But if they aren't people who believe and express the faith of the church, the doctrines of the church, then I think they're misrepresenting who they are and who they ought to be.''
The sisters say they see no contradiction in embracing the Catholic faith while also being open to questioning certain church teachings based on new information or new experiences. The Leadership Conference has not taken a stand in favor of the ordination of women or the acceptance of gay relationships, but it has discussed such topics at its meetings. Members insist that open discussion of church doctrine is not only their right but is also healthy for the church.
They say their approach is no different from that of many Catholic priests and laypeople, not just those in the United States. As evidence, they cite messages of support they have received from Catholic religious orders of men and women all over Europe, Asia and Latin America -- as well as in the United States.
''We make our vows, but our obedience isn't blind,'' said one mother superior, who, like others, did not want to be identified while the future of the Leadership Conference is in limbo. ''Obedience comes from listening.''
Vatican II led to dramatic changes now taken for granted by many Catholics: allowing worship in local languages instead of only Latin, encouraging the participation of laypeople, and cooperating with other churches and faiths.
The council also approved a document, ''Perfectae Caritatis'' (''Perfect Love''), that instructed men and women in religious orders to study their orders' founders and original sources, and use that inspiration to re-evaluate and renew their mission. The sisters say they took the instruction to heart.
''We were the ones who probably took Vatican II and ran the fastest and the farthest with it,'' said Sister Janice Farnham, a retired professor of church history at the Boston College School of Theology and Ministry. ''Sometimes our church leaders forget, we were tasked to do these things by the church. The church said jump, and we said, how high?
''The church said update, renew, go back to your sources, and we did it as best we could. We did it with a passion, and we paid dearly.''
The sisters after Vatican II had access as never before to higher education, and they went on to become scholars and theologians, chief executives of hospitals, legal aid lawyers, social workers and martyrs in countries like El Salvador. They took on issues including economic injustice, racism, women's rights, immigration, interfaith relations and environmentalism -- which for many years put them in collegial working relationships with bishops who were also engaged in those causes.
But the two popes who reigned for the last 34 years -- first John Paul II and now Benedict XVI -- appointed bishops who are far more theologically and politically conservative than their predecessors. Drawing on these popes' teachings, this new generation of American bishops has steered the church's social priorities toward opposition to abortion, gay marriage and secularism.
The Leadership Conference was a thorn in the Vatican's side even before 1979, the year its president at the time, Sister Theresa Kane, welcomed John Paul to Washington with a public plea to ordain women in the priesthood. The group has remained unified despite pressure from the Vatican by making decisions only after consulting its membership. It is hardly the small splinter group that some conservative critics have recently tried to portray.
The disciplinary action against the nuns comes just as American bishops are struggling to reassert their authority with a wayward flock. The bishops are in the midst of a campaign to defend against what they see as serious threats to religious liberty -- especially a government mandate to provide employees of Catholic institutions with health insurance that covers contraception. But the prelates are well aware of polls showing that about 95 percent of Catholic women have used birth control at some point in their lives, and 52 percent support same-sex marriage -- little different from the public at large.
The dissonance is of great concern to American bishops and the Vatican.
''The church must speak with one voice,'' Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano, the papal nuncio to the United States, said in an address in June to American bishops at their meeting in Atlanta. ''We all know that the fundamental tactic of the enemy is to show a church divided.''
He added pointedly that at this ''difficult time,'' there is a special need for women and men in religious orders, and for Catholic universities, to ''take on an attitude of deep communion'' with the bishops.

HEADLINE: Is Algebra Necessary?

BYLINE: By ANDREW HACKER. 
An emeritus professor of political science at Queens College, City University of New York, and a co-author of ''Higher Education? How Colleges Are Wasting Our Money and Failing Our Kids -- and What We Can Do About It.''

 BODY:
A TYPICAL American school day finds some six million high school students and two million college freshmen struggling with algebra. In both high school and college, all too many students are expected to fail. Why do we subject American students to this ordeal? I've found myself moving toward the strong view that we shouldn't.
My question extends beyond algebra and applies more broadly to the usual mathematics sequence, from geometry through calculus. State regents and legislators -- and much of the public -- take it as self-evident that every young person should be made to master polynomial functions and parametric equations.
There are many defenses of algebra and the virtue of learning it. Most of them sound reasonable on first hearing; many of them I once accepted. But the more I examine them, the clearer it seems that they are largely or wholly wrong -- unsupported by research or evidence, or based on wishful logic. (I'm not talking about quantitative skills, critical for informed citizenship and personal finance, but a very different ballgame.) 
This debate matters. Making mathematics mandatory prevents us from discovering and developing young talent. In the interest of maintaining rigor, we're actually depleting our pool of brainpower. I say this as a writer and social scientist whose work relies heavily on the use of numbers. My aim is not to spare students from a difficult subject, but to call attention to the real problems we are causing by misdirecting precious resources.
The toll mathematics takes begins early. To our nation's shame, one in four ninth graders fail to finish high school. In South Carolina, 34 percent fell away in 2008-9, according to national data released last year; for Nevada, it was 45 percent. Most of the educators I've talked with cite algebra as the major academic reason.
Shirley Bagwell, a longtime Tennessee teacher, warns that ''to expect all students to master algebra will cause more students to drop out.'' For those who stay in school, there are often ''exit exams,'' almost all of which contain an algebra component. In Oklahoma, 33 percent failed to pass last year, as did 35 percent in West Virginia.
Algebra is an onerous stumbling block for all kinds of students: disadvantaged and affluent, black and white. In New Mexico, 43 percent of white students fell below ''proficient,'' along with 39 percent in Tennessee. Even well-endowed schools have otherwise talented students who are impeded by algebra, to say nothing of calculus and trigonometry.
California's two university systems, for instance, consider applications only from students who have taken three years of mathematics and in that way exclude many applicants who might excel in fields like art or history. Community college students face an equally prohibitive mathematics wall. A study of two-year schools found that fewer than a quarter of their entrants passed the algebra classes they were required to take.
''There are students taking these courses three, four, five times,'' says Barbara Bonham of Appalachian State University. While some ultimately pass, she adds, ''many drop out.''
Another dropout statistic should cause equal chagrin. Of all who embark on higher education, only 58 percent end up with bachelor's degrees. The main impediment to graduation: freshman math. The City University of New York, where I have taught since 1971, found that 57 percent of its students didn't pass its mandated algebra course. The depressing conclusion of a faculty report: ''failing math at all levels affects retention more than any other academic factor.'' A national sample of transcripts found mathematics had twice as many F's and D's compared as other subjects.
Nor will just passing grades suffice. Many colleges seek to raise their status by setting a high mathematics bar. Hence, they look for 700 on the math section of the SAT, a height attained in 2009 by only 9 percent of men and 4 percent of women. And it's not just Ivy League colleges that do this: at schools like Vanderbilt, Rice and Washington University in St. Louis, applicants had best be legacies or athletes if they have scored less than 700 on their math SATs.
It's true that students in Finland, South Korea and Canada score better on mathematics tests. But it's their perseverance, not their classroom algebra, that fits them for demanding jobs.
Nor is it clear that the math we learn in the classroom has any relation to the quantitative reasoning we need on the job. John P. Smith III, an educational psychologist at Michigan State University who has studied math education, has found that ''mathematical reasoning in workplaces differs markedly from the algorithms taught in school.'' Even in jobs that rely on so-called STEM credentials -- science, technology, engineering, math -- considerable training occurs after hiring, including the kinds of computations that will be required. Toyota, for example, recently chose to locate a plant in a remote Mississippi county, even though its schools are far from stellar. It works with a nearby community college, which has tailored classes in ''machine tool mathematics.''
That sort of collaboration has long undergirded German apprenticeship programs. I fully concur that high-tech knowledge is needed to sustain an advanced industrial economy. But we're deluding ourselves if we believe the solution is largely academic.
A skeptic might argue that, even if our current mathematics education discourages large numbers of students, math itself isn't to blame. Isn't this discipline a critical part of education, providing quantitative tools and honing conceptual abilities that are indispensable -- especially in our high tech age? In fact, we hear it argued that we have a shortage of graduates with STEM credentials.
Of course, people should learn basic numerical skills: decimals, ratios and estimating, sharpened by a good grounding in arithmetic. But a definitive analysis by the Georgetown Center on Education and the Workforce forecasts that in the decade ahead a mere 5 percent of entry-level workers will need to be proficient in algebra or above. And if there is a shortage of STEM graduates, an equally crucial issue is how many available positions there are for men and women with these skills. A January 2012 analysis from the Georgetown center found 7.5 percent unemployment for engineering graduates and 8.2 percent among computer scientists.
Peter Braunfeld of the University of Illinois tells his students, ''Our civilization would collapse without mathematics.'' He's absolutely right.
Algebraic algorithms underpin animated movies, investment strategies and airline ticket prices. And we need people to understand how those things work and to advance our frontiers.
Quantitative literacy clearly is useful in weighing all manner of public policies, from the Affordable Care Act, to the costs and benefits of environmental regulation, to the impact of climate change. Being able to detect and identify ideology at work behind the numbers is of obvious use. Ours is fast becoming a statistical age, which raises the bar for informed citizenship. What is needed is not textbook formulas but greater understanding of where various numbers come from, and what they actually convey.
What of the claim that mathematics sharpens our minds and makes us more intellectually adept as individuals and a citizen body? It's true that mathematics requires mental exertion. But there's no evidence that being able to prove (x$(2$) + y$(2$))$(2$) = (x$(2$) - y$(2$))$(2$) + (2xy)$(2$) leads to more credible political opinions or social analysis.
Many of those who struggled through a traditional math regimen feel that doing so annealed their character. This may or may not speak to the fact that institutions and occupations often install prerequisites just to look rigorous -- hardly a rational justification for maintaining so many mathematics mandates. Certification programs for veterinary technicians require algebra, although none of the graduates I've met have ever used it in diagnosing or treating their patients. Medical schools like Harvard and Johns Hopkins demand calculus of all their applicants, even if it doesn't figure in the clinical curriculum, let alone in subsequent practice. Mathematics is used as a hoop, a badge, a totem to impress outsiders and elevate a profession's status.
It's not hard to understand why Caltech and M.I.T. want everyone to be proficient in mathematics. But it's not easy to see why potential poets and philosophers face a lofty mathematics bar. Demanding algebra across the board actually skews a student body, not necessarily for the better.
I WANT to end on a positive note. Mathematics, both pure and applied, is integral to our civilization, whether the realm is aesthetic or electronic. But for most adults, it is more feared or revered than understood. It's clear that requiring algebra for everyone has not increased our appreciation of a calling someone once called ''the poetry of the universe.'' (How many college graduates remember what Fermat's dilemma was all about?)
Instead of investing so much of our academic energy in a subject that blocks further attainment for much of our population, I propose that we start thinking about alternatives. Thus mathematics teachers at every level could create exciting courses in what I call ''citizen statistics.'' This would not be a backdoor version of algebra, as in the Advanced Placement syllabus. Nor would it focus on equations used by scholars when they write for one another. Instead, it would familiarize students with the kinds of numbers that describe and delineate our personal and public lives.
It could, for example, teach students how the Consumer Price Index is computed, what is included and how each item in the index is weighted -- and include discussion about which items should be included and what weights they should be given.
This need not involve dumbing down. Researching the reliability of numbers can be as demanding as geometry. More and more colleges are requiring courses in ''quantitative reasoning.'' In fact, we should be starting that in kindergarten.
I hope that mathematics departments can also create courses in the history and philosophy of their discipline, as well as its applications in early cultures. Why not mathematics in art and music -- even poetry -- along with its role in assorted sciences? The aim would be to treat mathematics as a liberal art, making it as accessible and welcoming as sculpture or ballet. If we rethink how the discipline is conceived, word will get around and math enrollments are bound to rise. It can only help. Of the 1.7 million bachelor's degrees awarded in 2010, only 15,396 -- less than 1 percent -- were in mathematics.
I've observed a host of high school and college classes, from Michigan to Mississippi, and have been impressed by conscientious teaching and dutiful students. I'll grant that with an outpouring of resources, we could reclaim many dropouts and help them get through quadratic equations. But that would misuse teaching talent and student effort. It would be far better to reduce, not expand, the mathematics we ask young people to imbibe. (That said, I do not advocate vocational tracks for students considered, almost always unfairly, as less studious.)
Yes, young people should learn to read and write and do long division, whether they want to or not. But there is no reason to force them to grasp vectorial angles and discontinuous functions. Think of math as a huge boulder we make everyone pull, without assessing what all this pain achieves. So why require it, without alternatives or exceptions? Thus far I haven't found a compelling answer.

HEADLINE: Coming Soon: The Big Trade-Off

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
WHEN you talk to Chinese officials lately, it doesn't take long before they express concern about America's ''rebalancing'' of forces -- the prospect that we'll shift more troops from the Middle East, where they are containing instability, to Asia, where they would contain China. My standard reply is that China is worrying about the wrong thing. It is not that we'll shift our Marines from the Middle East to Asia; it's that we are going to shift them from the Middle East to San Diego -- because we can't afford to be the world's policeman much longer, and China will have to fill some of the void.
Good luck, world! It's been fun hanging with you, but we can't pay for it anymore -- not with all of us baby boomers about to retire with no savings. We have a new strategic doctrine coming: ''U.S. foreign policy in the age of Alzheimer's.'' We'll do what we can afford and forget the rest. 
Why do I say that? In part it's because I spent time this week with the Washington staff of The Jewish Federations of North America, or JFNA, which represents the 155 Jewish community federations across America. They may seem like an unlikely interlocutor for a foreign affairs columnist, but they're not. Like their counterparts, Catholic Charities and Lutheran Services, these Jewish federations operate nursing homes, hospitals, elder-care programs, meals on wheels, job-training, hospices and family social services in cities across America. And the financial challenges they're all facing today are profound -- as the baby boomers are aging -- and so too are the trade-offs we'll have to make between nursing homes in America and nursery schools in Afghanistan. Unless we get some sustained economic growth, Afghanistan is going to lose.
William Daroff, the director of JFNA's Washington office, starts with this fact: Since the 2008 economic crisis, annual donations to Jewish federations have been flat, while there has been a sharp increase in demand for services and significant cuts in Medicaid and block grants that help pay for them. ''We have people who were donors to our programs five years ago, now knocking on the door to use those same programs'' -- from people in need of job-training to those in need of help to cover a mortgage payment, said Daroff.
And we haven't seen anything yet, explains Barbara Bedney, the director of public policy for JFNA. ''We will see a doubling of the number of older adults -- people over the age of 65 -- by 2030, as the baby boomers age,'' she explained, and one of the fastest growing groups will be the ''old-old'' -- those who are 85 years old and older, who are living longer but requiring even more expensive care. And wait until the baby boomer cohort reaches their 80s. Alzheimer's Disease Research reports that roughly 5.4 million Americans of all ages had Alzheimer's disease in 2012, and, by 2050, more than 15 million Americans could be living with the disease -- a key reason nursing home residents are predicted to double over the next 30 years.
And many baby boomers, says Steven Woolf, the senior tax policy counsel for JFNA, ''are nowhere near prepared in terms of retirement savings'' for the kinds of costs they are going to incur after they stop working -- in an age in which they will be living longer, the government will have less to offer, they each will have fewer kids to care for them and social service agencies will be swamped with demands.
Indeed, a 2011 survey by the Employee Benefit Research Institute found that a ''sizable percentage of workers report they have virtually no savings or investments.'' Among those workers polled in its retirement confidence survey, ''29 percent say they have less than $1,000. In total, more than half of workers (56 percent) report that the total value of their household's savings and investments, excluding the value of their primary home and any defined benefit plans, is less than $25,000.''
That could pay for one hospital stay and recuperation in a nursing home, or dealing with just one parent with Alzheimer's. And all that's before the next president and Congress agree on a long-term fiscal rebalancing plan that will surely reduce Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security benefits. Fortunately, two-thirds of baby boomer households are expected to receive some kind of inheritance over their lifetime to cushion the blow. Also, baby boomers as a generation have been very volunteer-oriented, and we're going to need a lot of family volunteers to work with the elderly.
Indeed, says Bedney, today ''family informal caregivers provide about 80 percent of elder care,'' delivering meals to parents or aunts or driving them from place to place and managing their doctor visits and medications. But there are lots of problems associated with this care, she added: ''lost work hours, high stress, declines in physical health.'' Up to now, though, family caregivers have been largely ignored by policy makers, which is a mistake we must remedy, because ''when we support family caregivers, we enable older adults to 'age in place' instead of in a high-cost institution,'' said Bedney.
But, as any family caregiver can tell you, it is no picnic. ''One of the leading risk factors for the institutionalization of older adults is the declining health of the person taking care of them,'' added Bedney. ''You're lifting someone and you do it wrong and you both fall.''
Add up all these trend lines and you can see why, over the next decade, we must get more consistent economic growth as a society and, also, adds Daroff, come up with more policy and technology innovations that allow us to provide a lot more elder care, in particular aging at home, for a lot less money. That will require breakthroughs like remote diagnosis equipment in every home that can track a patient's weight, blood sugar or lung capacity and dispatch it to a hospital, or clothing with sensors woven into the fabric that will be able track all physical indicators around the clock.
Nursing homes, nursery schools or nursing Afghanistan -- these are the trade-offs we'll have to make in this decade, unless we have a real growth spurt. Mitt Romney gave a big foreign policy speech last week, waxing eloquent about how he would be more assertive of U.S. interests abroad than President Obama and ensure that this is an ''American century.'' Really? I like American centuries. But to paraphrase an old saying: a foreign policy vision without a real plan to pay for it -- and manage all the trade-offs back home -- is just a hallucination.

HEADLINE: The Bronx Is Yearning

 BODY:
My first impression of a story entitled ''Why Can't the Bronx Be Like Brooklyn?'' is that it's always worth thinking about people in the Bronx who don't want it to be Brooklyn, and even people in Brooklyn who don't like what they think Brooklyn is becoming. Beyond that, I think this is a problem of form. In journalism, if your neighborhood isn't being populated with cool shops and young, single people, it's a ghetto suffering from decades of societal neglect. If it actually is being populated by all the pretty people, it's an enclave that we worry is losing its sense of identity. . . . The question of how different areas of a city develop or don't is an interesting one. I just don't like the assumption that everyone wants areas to develop the same way. A lot of us just want things like safety and decent schools not to be considered luxury goods. 
TA-NEHISI COATES, posted on theatlantic.com
Please don't gentrify the Bronx! We're not yearning! There should be at least one affordable place to raise children in this great city of ours.
CUYLER CHRISTIANSON, the Bronx
Robert Moses couldn't imagine that the very people he had consigned to the rubble of the burned-out South Bronx could have the vision, the ingenuity, the gumption and the persistence to rebuild. But that's what happened and is continuing to happen. Grass-roots organizations like Nos Quedamos, Banana Kelly and the Mid Bronx Desperados resisted efforts to displace residents. . . . Other organizations, from the Bronx Clean Air Coalition to the Bronx Council for Environmental Quality to Friends of Brook Park have labored to improve our quality of life with new parks and greenways and cleaner air and water. The Bronx River Alliance rescued a river; the Harlem River Working Group intends to rescue another.
BERNARD L. STEIN, posted on motthavenherald.com
Correction: An article on July 15 about Postville, Iowa, misspelled the last word in the name of a restaurant. It is Restaurante Rinconcito Guatemalteco, not Guatemaltecoa.
Correction: An article about Hillary Rodham Clinton misspelled the surname of a foreign-service officer who wrote an article mentioned by Clinton. He is Aaron D. Snipe, not Snipes. It also misstated which round of the United States-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue Clinton attended this year. It was the fourth round, not the third. A correction in this space on July 15 misstated the date the article was published. It was July 1, not June 17.
Of the online commenters on Adam Davidson's article, ''The Bronx Is Yearning,'' 63 people said that they have lived in the Bronx. They argued:
The Bronx's deficient transit system is to blame.
The Bronx has beautiful parks, institutions, and was a good place to grow up.
The Bronx's main problem is its negative stereotype.
Leave us alone, we don't want to be like Brooklyn.
Other.
The Bronx suffers from poor city services.
The Bronx is great because it's affordable.

HEADLINE: Caymans, Here We Come

BYLINE: By ADAM DAVIDSON. 
Adam Davidson is a co-founder of NPR's ''Planet Money,'' a podcast and blog.

 BODY:
Earlier this month, I decided to see how hard it would be to set up my own offshore bank account. I figured it would be pretty difficult, because I'm not rich and don't have a team of tax lawyers to oversee my money and because the E.U. and U.S. governments have been cracking down on tax havens by imposing stricter tax-sharing requirements. So I proceeded with some caution.
First, I Googled ''company registration tax haven'' and randomly picked three firms that set up accounts in offshore jurisdictions. Then I called each and explained that I was hoping to minimize my tax exposure and didn't want anyone to know anything about my finances. Each company quickly noted that I should consult a lawyer to make sure that I wasn't breaking the law. Then they calmly explained how to create an account that, it seemed to me, was unlikely to be discovered by the I.R.S. or any other authority. 
I ended up working with A&P Intertrust, a Canadian company that I chose largely because I liked its Web site the best. (The other two companies' sites appeared stuck in a late-'90s style with lots of flashing boxes.) A&P works with the governments of Panama, the British Virgin Islands and Belize. (Other companies that I contacted prefer the Seychelles, Cyprus or the Cayman Islands, where Mitt Romney has been reported to have money.) I decided to start my shell company in Belize because it would be exempt from all Belizean taxes and, as A&P's site explained, ''information about beneficial owners, shareholders, directors and officers is not filed with the Belize government and not available to the public.'' And I've been to Belize and like the place.
Setting up the company was a lot cheaper than I expected. A&P charged $900 for a basic Belizean incorporation and another $85 for a corporate seal to emboss legal documents. For $650 more, A&P offered to open a bank account to stash my fledgling operation's money in Singapore -- a country, the Web site also noted, that ''cannot gather information on foreigners' bank accounts, bank-deposit interest and investment gains under domestic tax law.'' And for another $690, it offered to assign a ''nominee'' who would be listed as the official manager and owner of my business but would report to me under a secret power-of-attorney contract. Then an A&P associate asked me to fill out the incorporation information online, just so she wouldn't type in anything incorrectly. The whole thing took about 10 minutes.
Amazingly neither A&P nor I broke any law in Canada, Belize, Singapore or the United States. The company required, in compliance with international legal standards, that I e-mail it a notarized copy of my passport, driver's license and some other identity documents. But a company representative also reassured me that these would not be visible to any tax authority. Just before they processed the paperwork, I explained that I was a journalist working on an article about offshore tax havens, and I haven't heard from them since. (A representative from A&P declined to comment for this article, but he did note in an e-mail that the company was still ''happy to serve [me] as a client.'')
Setting up an account may be easy, but managing one is expensive. Following the law requires a team of lawyers and accountants to carefully monitor tax laws in dozens of countries and maintain accounts that stay on the safe side of confusing rules. It's not really worth the cost for anyone other than wealthy investors looking to put aside money, tax-free, for future generations. Or for large multinationals who prefer to centralize their global cash-flow stream in a place that doesn't tax corporations or require a lot of financial reporting. Why would a huge company like G.E. want to pay U.S. taxes every time its Spanish subsidiary sells parts to a company in Belarus when it could avoid them by incorporating offshore?
It's easy to imagine that most other kinds of offshore activity are shady, but there is no definitive way to know, because we don't even know how much money is in these centers. The estimates, however, are striking. The Bank for International Settlements, which collects voluntary reports from banks in 44 countries, offers the best single source of data. It counts around $31 trillion of foreign-owned assets in the world's banks and estimates that about $4 trillion is in offshore financial centers. An estimated $1.5 trillion is in the Cayman Islands alone. The country of 52,000, which is about the size of Blaine, Minn., has more foreign-owned deposits than Japan or the Netherlands.
By the B.I.S.'s own estimation, the data -- which do not include reports from Belize, the Seychelles and other offshore havens -- are quite incomplete. The Tax Justice Network, a global research firm that advocates against such havens, suggests that the amount hidden offshore is between $21 trillion and $32 trillion. If properly taxed, that could yield more than $200 billion in revenue around the world. Furthermore, because a 2010 McKinsey & Company report estimated the world's financial assets at about $200 trillion, somewhere around 10 percent or more of the world's wealth is effectively invisible. And it's also almost certainly in the hands of the people and institutions that most actively influence major investment decisions.
Lately the United States and the European Union have expressed deep frustration with the international system of sharing tax information. In order to investigate my Belizean company's bank account in Singapore, for instance, the I.R.S. would need to identify my bank and bank-account number, prove I had broken the law and then petition judges in Belize and Singapore to issue court orders forcing the release of my information. It's a nearly impossible standard. It can also be easily undermined by enlarging the web of new accounts.
Next year, Washington will enact the most ambitious tax-recovery plan in history, the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act. Under Fatca, foreign financial firms will have to proactively identify every American account holder with assets of more than $50,000 and report details about their financial activity or face a significant penalty. The move is very unpopular among foreign banks, governments and Americans living abroad, but the more complex rules could actually mean more business for offshore centers. By the time Fatca is in full force, in 2017, truly wealthy individuals and corporations will almost certainly have used their resources to find more intricate loopholes.
One often-overlooked lesson of the financial crisis is that shenanigans don't happen in the absence of regulation; they happen when regulations are exceedingly complex and involve confusing, overlapping regulatory authorities. Collateralized debt obligations and credit-default swaps were designed to squeeze through a labyrinth of laws, rules and taxes. And most of these toxic assets were formed in offshore jurisdictions, far from prying eyes and stricter reporting requirements. When Lehman Brothers collapsed, it took regulators and creditors more than a year to find out that the company comprised nearly 3,000 legal entities spread across 50 countries.
My colleagues at NPR's ''Planet Money'' recently polled several economists of all political stripes and found that while they disagreed on the right level of taxation, they generally agreed that the overly complex taxation of rich people and corporations was disastrous. It all but guarantees that those people and companies will spend an inordinate amount of money figuring out how to game the system rather than come up with new ideas that improve the economy. Economists generally agree that the best tax system would be simple and strict, offering little incentive to lobby for loopholes. The big problem, of course, is that many of the people and corporations with the most influence over Congress don't want it that way.
Deep thoughts this week:
1. It takes 10 minutes to open an offshore account.
2. But keeping it legal is expensive.
3. It would be better if the rules were simpler.
4. Then companies might spend more on innovation and less on tax lawyers.

HEADLINE: Medicaid After the Supreme Court Decision

 BODY:
Last week there were two disturbing reports about Medicaid, a program of health insurance for the poor that is mostly managed by the states and jointly paid for by the federal and state governments. The Congressional Budget Office predicted that states with a large number of poor people would not expand their Medicaid programs as required by the health care reform law now that the Supreme Court had made expansion optional. And a Harvard study unrelated to the court decision made it clear that a failure to expand Medicaid would likely doom thousands of low-income people to death or poor health. 
Revising earlier estimates to take account of the decision, the budget office said that making expanded assistance optional could leave three million more people uninsured in 2022, saving the federal government $84 billion through 2022 because it would not have to subsidize their coverage.
The analysts made no effort to predict which states would or would not expand Medicaid. Instead, they looked at various factors that might influence the states' decisions and predicted that some would not respond to even the extremely generous matching money that the reform law provided.
They forecast that some states that already had trouble paying for their existing Medicaid programs would put off expanding Medicaid until their economies improved, or would expand the program partially, not to the extent originally required. Other states may shun the program entirely, as some Republican governors have vowed to do. By 2022, the budget office projects, only two-thirds of those who would become newly eligible for Medicaid if all states expanded to the levels sought by the reform law will actually gain eligibility. One-third will not, either because their states refuse to expand Medicaid at all or expand it only partially.
Leaving low-income people uninsured will almost certainly damage their health. A study by three researchers affiliated with the Harvard School of Public Health, published by The New England Journal of Medicine, compared three states (New York, Arizona and Maine) that had already expanded coverage of childless or disabled adults with four neighboring states (Pennsylvania, New Mexico, Nevada and New Hampshire) that had not. Deaths among people ages 20 to 64 dropped in the three expansion states by about 1,500 a year, adjusted for population growth, whereas death rates in the comparison states went up. Expansion also brought a 21 percent reduction in cost-related delays in getting care.
Some critics, mostly conservative Republicans, contend that Medicaid does not improve the health of beneficiaries and may even harm them. The new study should lay that canard to rest. State officials who want to save money by not expanding Medicaid will be harming their most vulnerable residents, and will most likely shift the cost of any emergency care they need to safety net institutions, taxpayers and charities.

HEADLINE: Archdiocese to Sell Beach House

BYLINE: By JILL P. CAPUZZO

 BODY:
Ventnor
CROWNING a perfectly manicured front lawn, the rose-colored hydrangeas are in full bloom, as are the potted petunias and geraniums that grace the patio and steps of a 9,800-square-foot beachfront home here owned by the Archdiocese of Philadelphia. But the priests who frequently used to be seen on the porch, rocking in the wicker chairs, are missing.
The last of the elderly clergymen packed their bags at the end of June, after the archdiocese -- which faces an operating deficit in excess of $17 million this year -- announced plans to sell the house, Villa St. Joseph by the Sea, as one of several cost-cutting measures. Other cutbacks included eliminating 45 archdiocesan positions, consolidating 19 offices, and ceasing publication of the archdiocese's newspaper.
Legal costs accrued by the archdiocese in the recent priest sex-abuse investigations, and the trial and ultimate conviction of one of its leaders, Msgr. William J. Lynn, on child-endangerment charges, amounted to $11.6 million. But while describing the expenses as ''burdensome,'' Donna Farrell, the director of communications for the Philadelphia Archdiocese, said in an e-mail that they had ''played little role in the current budget decisions.'' 
Assessed at $6.25 million, the 19-room Ventnor house was built in 1905 and became a vacation home for retired priests in 1963, when Hannah Hogan, a local real estate investor, donated it for a nominal $1,000 fee in memory of her brother, the Rev. Edward Hogan. Operating the house at 114 South Princeton Avenue has proved costly. Last year it generated a property tax bill of $114,562; with maintenance costs and salary for staff members -- among them caretakers, nurses and landscapers -- total expenses have been much higher.
Ms. Farrell said the church had made no final decision on when the house would be put on the market or which agency would get the listing. But that hasn't quelled discussion in Ventnor, a city of 10,650 residents south of Atlantic City, on the fate of this property on a blocklong lot with 175 feet of boardwalk frontage.
Ashley Franchini, a broker with Soleil Sotheby's International Realty in Margate, currently has a $10.3 million listing in Ocean City and a $12.4 million oceanfront listing in Longport. ''There might be somebody who would really enjoy restoring it and creating a modern-day version,'' she said of the property, though she acknowledged that dividing it up would be a more profitable way to go.
Two doors north on the boardwalk, Ms. Franchini has a $3.1 million listing for a 3,000-square-foot house on less than a tenth of an acre. Using that math, she estimated that the archdiocese's half-acre site could yield four or more building lots, which would push the value of the property over $12 million. Still, like other area residents, she hoped the estate might remain intact.
''Properties like this, that are so unique and come with so much land, only come up once in a lifetime,'' she said. ''People who can afford this understand they may never get this opportunity again.'' She noted that the house abutting the estate on South Portland Avenue was also for sale; if bought together, the two might make an exceptional property.
Like Ms. Franchini, Mary Lou Ferry, who owns Farley & Ferry Realty in Ventnor and grew up in the house next to the estate, is hoping to get the listing. She said that her firm had contacted the archdiocese over the years to gauge interest in selling the house, and that it had reached out again recently. ''There's a great curiosity as to what will happen and what its real value is,'' Ms. Ferry said. ''A beachfront parcel is a completely different species than just being in a beach block.'' She has childhood memories of climbing over a brick wall to check out the latest additions to the priests' fishpond.
This is not the first time a religious order facing economic hardship has decided to sell valuable shore property in the vicinity. The Sisters of Charity of New York sold their Ventnor home more than 10 years ago, because they could no longer afford the property taxes, according to Elena Miranda, the director of communications for the order. At the time, the sisters requested that the house, declared a landmark, not be sold to developers, so it was sold to an individual -- who in turn sold it to a developer, she said. It was eventually demolished to make way for multiple building lots.
Other orders have been more successful at holding onto their beachfront properties, in part by inviting the public in. In the 1970s, as the size of their novitiate shrank over the years, the Sisters of St. Joseph of Peace in Englewood Cliffs opened up their Long Branch retreat house, Stella Maris, to nonclergy. Today the sisters welcome nonprofit groups and individuals seeking guided or self-directed retreats to use one of the 42 rooms in the oceanfront house. The summer room rate is $90 a night, and also covers three meals, according to Sister Lois, the administrator at Stella Maris.
St. Mary-by-the-Sea in Cape May Point, owned by the Sisters of St. Joseph-Philadelphia, has a similar program, though two-thirds of those who stay there belong either to their order or another one. The remaining third are laypeople, coming for one of the numerous silent retreats that the Sisters of St. Joseph organize throughout the summer, said Joan Dollinger, the retreat's administrator. The 135-room house and its property, which cost the order $9,000 in 1909, benefit from the work of volunteers.
''In the course of a summer we get hundreds of volunteers,'' Ms. Dollinger said. ''Sisters, laypeople, people who want to give back for what they received when they were here. It's a sight to behold.''
As for Villa St. Joseph by the Sea, it played host to several dignitaries, and more recently was available for group retreats. Its limited use, combined with the scandals that have enveloped the Philadelphia Archdiocese of late, has some feeling that the sale of the Ventnor house is overdue. Nancy Mortimer O'Brien, an officer with the Philadelphia chapter of the Voice of the Faithful, a national group that started in 2002 in response to reports of child sex abuse by priests, said such luxuries were inappropriate, particularly when the church was closing schools.
''They're entitled to a vacation,'' she said of the clergy. ''I don't begrudge them that, but we don't have to provide it. Not the good people who are putting money in the collection plates.''

HEADLINE: Leafy Yet Gritty, With Water Views

BYLINE: By C. J. HUGHES

 BODY:
THE spit of beach at the end of Dock Road in South Norwalk, a lively community 45 miles from Manhattan, offers a handy way to understand the little-bit-of-this, little-bit-of-that spirit of the place.
To the left looms the blue hulk of the Manresa Power Plant, an active facility and a reminder that the area, part of the city of Norwalk, still has a working and sometimes gritty waterfront.
To the right is Village Creek, which meanders past lush banks and moored boats. What few houses there are seem so generously surrounded by trees as to be almost invisible.
Being at once industrial and suburban has benefits, says Jim DePasquale, who enjoys the view of boats on Norwalk Harbor from his five-bedroom Cape, for which he paid $400,000 in 2005. Although water views can sometimes come along with a location on a dune-enclosed dead-end, Mr. DePasquale's neighborhood has sidewalks connecting it seamlessly to the bustling restaurant-and-bar district known as SoNo along Washington Street. 
Created in the 1980s from a run-down mix of 19th-century warehouses, in part to save them from the wrecking ball, SoNo continues to bustle at night.
On some blocks there is lingering crime -- recent police reports cite burglaries and assaults, and in May there was a homicide -- but Mr. DePasquale, who lived in Manhattan before moving to South Norwalk, says every urban area has these issues. ''We're a New York-style quaint little town,'' was how he put it.
Crime aside, however, South Norwalk's rough-and-tumble edges make it more down-to-earth than other towns in the region, whose showy affluence has earned it the nickname the Gold Coast.
''I like to think of us as a very high-end blue-collar community,'' said Michael Harden, who works as a lobsterman after a career spent building models for corporations like Knoll. ''We all work for a living down here.''
Mr. Harden's wood-sided 1910 house, with four bedrooms and two baths, cost $290,000 in 1998, though he admits he probably got a favorable price because he knew the seller. Today, it might fetch $750,000, Mr. Harden says, citing a recent renovation that included elevation to protect against flooding.
With a wide variety of houses, the majority under $1 million, South Norwalk is able to claim socioeconomic diversity, which can't be said for every bedroom community in the county.
''There are great people here from very different backgrounds,'' said Tanya Anderson, an educator who moved with her husband to a three-bedroom Cape from Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, in 2003. The house, which cost $280,000, has undergone a $200,000 renovation, which among other things added central air-conditioning, a rarity in many of the World War II-era neighborhoods.
But the chance to help an area in transition, Ms. Anderson said, is far more important than a good deal. In 2005 her husband, Brian, revived the long-dormant Harbor Shores Association, becoming its president. ''We wanted to pull the community together,'' said Ms. Anderson, adding that the group's several dozen members aren't required to pay dues but do help tackle quality-of-life issues like making sure wetlands are protected from a nearby paving company and junkyard.
And the group seems to have won over city officials, whom it persuaded to repave tennis courts and repair drinking fountains in Woodward Avenue Park. ''We all want the same things out of life,'' Ms. Anderson said.
WHAT YOU'LL FIND
With about 25,000 people across three and a half square miles, South Norwalk roughly aligns with the 06854 ZIP code.
A part of Norwalk, South Norwalk itself has distinct sections. The grandest is Wilson Point, an 80-home gated community nuzzling Rowayton where some Tudor estates, with turrets, resemble castles. Wilson Point is also home to the Norwalk Yacht Club, which in the mid-20th century was a port for tankers unloading oil.
In Harbor View, a peninsular 100-home association, hydrangeas frame tiny lots with well-kept historic homes. A sign reminds residents of Friday ''High Tide'' cocktails at a clubhouse.
The architecture of the 67-home Village Creek association, however, evokes the Connecticut seen in the 1997 Ang Lee film ''The Ice Storm,'' which is set in New Canaan: midcentury moderns with flat roofs and carports. It was planned in the 1940s as an interracial community.
There are also a handful of housing projects, like the red-brick 1942 Washington Village, on Water Street.
Attempts at redevelopment in recent years, as part of a decades-long urban renewal project, have occasionally created a work-in-progress appearance in some areas -- for instance the windswept 12-acre parcel near the neighborhood's gateway on West Avenue. The mixed-use project planned for the site, District 95/7 SoNo, from Spinnaker Real Estate Partners and Greenfield Partners, is expected to resume work this fall after years of delays, according to Clayton Fowler, the chief executive of Spinnaker. Similarly, a plan to build housing at a former compressor factory at the busy intersection of North Water and Washington Streets, stalled by the recession, is being undertaken by Spinnaker as a 107-unit rental with ground-floor retail, Mr. Fowler said.
And this summer the F. D. Rich Company, a local landlord, was approved to build a 52-unit rental, and large garage, on a parking lot at 99 Washington.
If completed, they would join a few shining accomplishments: a handsome refurbished red-brick former industrial shell that houses both offices and rentals, at 21 Ann Street, a onetime corset factory; and a three-building new-construction condo-and-rental complex called the Maritime Yards.
South Norwalk's eventual build-out will knit together the area along the western side of the harbor, says Timothy Sheehan, who heads the Norwalk Redevelopment Agency. ''Most cities have clearly identifiable downtowns. What we have is an urban corridor.''
WHAT YOU'LL PAY
Earlier this month, there were 89 single- and multifamily homes on the market in ZIP code 06854, at an average of $642,000, according to the Greater Fairfield County Consolidated Multiple Listing Service. They ranged from a three-bedroom single-family, at $155,000, to a five-bedroom with a pool and water view in Wilson Point, at $5.4 million, the data show. There were 67 condos on the market, at an average of $267,000.
The housing market continues to be soft across Fairfield County, and South Norwalk is no exception. In 2011, 123 single- and multifamily homes sold, at an average of $495,000, while in 2007, at the height of the boom, 137 sold at an average of $619,000, the listing service data show. This puts prices off their recent highs by 20 percent. Similarly, in 2011, 58 condos sold, at an average of $271,000, and in 2007, 170 sold at an average of $329,000; that was an 18 percent decline.
Despite the slump, Nancy Crosland, a broker with William Pitt Sotheby's International Realty, says interest among buyers increased in the first half of this year. ''Everything under $750,000 is hot,'' she said.
THE COMMUTE
South Norwalk has a stop on the New Haven line of Metro-North. On weekdays, 9 trains run between 6 and 8 a.m. to Grand Central, taking 58 to 70 minutes. A monthly pass costs $293.02 online. Permits for the 705 reserved spaces cost $83 a month, or $996 a year. The waiting list to get one is a year long.
WHAT TO DO
SoNo has the night life, even though a few high-profile restaurants have closed in recent years. New on the scene is Shanghai Asian Bistro, part of a local chain, which opened last week.
A decade ago, late-night noise led to a lawsuit from a resident, but people who live upstairs now seem to have adopted a live-and-let-party attitude. For instance there's Abbie Goetting, a designer who moved to a rental two years ago from the much quieter Glenbrook section of Stamford. ''You come here knowing what it will be about,'' she said.
For mellower pursuits there is the Maritime Aquarium, a catalyst for area redevelopment when it opened in 1988. Exhibits at the aquarium, a major attraction, showcase otters, turtles and sharks. And Calf Pasture Beach in East Norwalk is open to all Norwalk residents.
THE SCHOOLS
An option is Rowayton Elementary School, next door in Rowayton, which teaches kindergarten through fifth grade to 453 students. This year 90 percent of third-graders met standards in math, 83 percent in reading, and 85 percent in writing, versus 86, 75 and 83 percent statewide.
Roton Middle School, with 457 students, teaches Grades 6 through 8. And Brien McMahon High School enrolls 1,701, said Dr. Susan Marks, the superintendent. In line with the area's diversity, about 40 percent of students are white, and 60 percent African-American or Latino, Dr. Marks said. SAT averages last year were 460 in math, 470 in reading and 506 in writing, versus 513, 509 and 513 statewide.
THE HISTORY
The Norwalk Museum, housed in the former City Hall on North Main Street, closed in May, but a quirky alternative may be found in the SoNo Switch Tower Museum, which offers bird's-eye views of passing trains from a Victorian-era former track control center.

TEACH YOUR CHILDREN WELL
Parenting for Authentic Success
By Madeline Levine
323 pp. Harper/HarperCollins Publishers. $26.99.
It would be easy, on first glance, to dismiss Madeline Levine's ''Teach Your Children Well'' as yet another new arrival in a long line of books that have urged us, in the past decade or so, to push back and just say no to the pressures of perfectionistic, high-performance parenting. But to give in to first impressions would be a mistake.
For Levine's latest book is, in fact, a cri de coeur from a clinician on the front lines of the battle between our better natures -- parents' deep and true love and concern for their kids -- and our culture's worst competitive and materialistic influences, all of which she sees played out, day after day, in her private psychology practice in affluent Marin County, Calif. Levine works with teenagers who are depleted, angry and sad as they compete for admission to a handful of big-name colleges, and with parents who can't steady or guide them, so lost are they in the pursuit of goals that have drained their lives of pleasure, contentment and connection. ''Our current version of success is a failure,'' she writes. It's a damning, and altogether accurate, clinical diagnosis. 
Levine's previous book, ''The Price of Privilege: How Parental Pressure and Material Advantage Are Creating a Generation of Disconnected and Unhappy Kids,'' opened with the image of a ''bright, personable, highly pressured'' 15-year-old girl with wealthy parents, who seemed, on the surface, to have it all. But a glimpse at her forearm revealed that she had also carved the word ''empty'' into her flesh with a razor. Teenagers like this, and adoring if preoccupied adults like her parents, haunt the pages of ''Teach Your Children Well.''
One academically talented girl in Levine's care is knocked off her feet by self-loathing and grief after she's rejected from a particularly desirable college. She ''lies in bed for days,'' Levine writes. ''She will not get up, and when I visit her at home, all she can say through her streaming tears is: 'It was all for nothing. I'm a complete failure.' ''
Other kids cheat, take drugs, drink, shut down or, worse still, keep up their tightrope act of parent-pleasing, Ivy-/aiming high achievement while quietly, invisibly dying inside. ''The cost of this relentless drive to perform at unrealistically high levels is a generation of kids who resemble nothing so much as trauma victims,'' Levine writes. ''They become preoccupied with events that have passed -- obsessing endlessly on a possible wrong answer or a missed opportunity. They are anxious and depressed and often self-medicate with drugs or alcohol. Sleep is difficult and they walk around in a fog of exhaustion. Other kids simply fold their cards and refuse to play.''
Levine has spent 30 years with these unhappy children, as a therapist and a mother of three sons who attended high-pressure schools. And now, it would seem, she's had it. She's had it with schools that worship at the altar of high achievement but do everything they can to undermine children's growth and well-being: eliminating recess; assigning mind-deadening amounts of homework; and ranking, measuring and valuing kids by narrowly focused test scores, while cutting out other areas of creative education in which large numbers of students who don't necessarily test well might find success and thrive. And she's had it with parents who profess to want nothing more than ''happiness'' for their children (''Kids laugh when I tell them that their parents don't mention money as a measure of success; they think I've been snowed,'' she divulges) while neglecting the aspects of family life that build enthusiasm and contentment, and overemphasizing values and activities that can actually do harm.
These are parents who run themselves ragged with work and hyper-parenting, presenting an ''eviscerated vision of the successful life'' that their children are then programmed to imitate. They're parents who are physically hyper-present but somehow psychologically M.I.A.: so caught up in the script that runs through their heads about how to ''do right'' by their children that they can't see when the excesses of keeping up, bulking up, getting a leg up and generally running scared send the whole enterprise of ostensible care and nurturing right off the rails.
This message -- that, essentially, every/thing today's parents think they're doing right is actually wrong -- is the most noteworthy take-away from the first two-thirds or so of this book, which otherwise spends a bit too much time consolidating and restating (without, unfortunately, adequate footnotes or in-text credits) a great deal of previously published wisdom on the dangers of /winner-take-all parenting.
Levine has good, if familiar, lessons for parents about the virtues of teaching empathy; encouraging the development of an authentic self; and making time for dreaming, creating and unstructured outdoor play. But she really comes into her own -- and will, if widely read, make an indelible mark on our parenting culture -- when she moves beyond child development to concentrate instead on parent development, exploring why we do the misguided things we do, and asking how we might (as we must) change ourselves and behave differently.
Here, her insights are fresh. ''When apples were sprayed with a chemical at my local supermarket, middle-aged moms turned out, picket signs and all, to protest the possible risk to their children's health,'' Levine reflects. ''Yet I've seen no similar demonstrations about an educational system that has far more research documenting its own toxicity. We have bought into this system not because we are bad people or are unconcerned about our children's well-being, but because we have been convinced that any other point of view will put our children at even greater risk.''
With vastly increasing numbers of children now showing stress-related symptoms, it's more urgent than ever, Levine argues, that parents learn new ways to express their love and concern, trading their fears of failure for faith in their children's innate strengths, and prioritizing the joys and challenges of life in the present over anxious visions of an uncertain future. ''There comes a point in parenting,'' she writes, ''where we must decide whether to maintain the status quo or, armed with new information, choose a different course. There is little question that our children are living in a world that is not simply oblivious to their needs, but is actually damaging them.''
Levine is correct to say that, as parents and as a society, we've reached a tipping point, in which the long-dawning awareness that there's something not quite right about our parenting is strengthening into a real desire for change. Families, their fortunes tracking the larger economy that encouraged so much of their excess, are crashing after bubble years in which they spent their every penny, and then some, on cultivating competitive greatness in their kids. Now exhausted, often disenchanted and (conveniently enough) broke, they're reconsidering whether the mad chase was worth all the resources that sustained it.
After all, as Levine notes, the inconvenient truth remains that not every child can be shaped and accelerated into Harvard material. But all kids can have their spirits broken, depression induced and anxiety stoked by too much stress, too little downtime and too much attention given to external factors that make them look good to an audience of appraising eyes but leave them feeling rotten inside.

HEADLINE: Atlantic City: Revel Atlantic City

BYLINE: By STEVEN McELROY

 BODY:
UPSHOT
At this lavish, $2.4 billion, 6.3 million-square-foot resort, the first casino hotel to open in Atlantic City in nine years, rooms start at a comparably reasonable $189.
BASICS
This is an audacious newcomer to the wobbly Atlantic City casino-hotel market, a 47-story tower that will ultimately have 1,898 guest rooms and suites. It is a stunning achievement, one that required courage, too, given that the city's 11 other casinos have struggled mightily in recent years. Seemingly endless escalators link the lower floors, and the 11th-floor lobby -- with bar and lounge and rooftop gardens and a pool -- is well above the casino, on the sixth floor.
LOCATION 
At the northernmost end of the Boardwalk, Revel stands tall in a prime spot with a sizable chunk of beach. It is separated enough from the rest of the casinos and some seedier businesses dotting the boardwalk that it manages to maintain a lofty distance.
THE ROOM
All rooms have an ocean view. Ours, No. 1103, had a king-size bed and floor-to-ceiling windows. The palette in the 463-square-foot space was varying shades of gray against dark wood, and the room included a super-long desk (more electrical outlets in the desk area would suit the space). An Android tablet on the bedside table offered a Web browser and hotel information, including room-service menus.
THE BATHROOM
Bright and spacious with light earthen marble tiles, a large stand-up shower with a bench and a double sink, the bathroom honors the palette and the comfort level of the room.
AMENITIES
A few areas of the complex are unfinished, including a boutique section (an upscale hotel-within-a-hotel) and a private beach, but plenty at Revel is in fine working order. Much of the pre-opening advertising was notable for making the casino seem almost an afterthought, and the list of nongaming attractions is long. Revel offers a 32,000-square-foot spa, a serene Skygarden outside the lobby, an indoor/outdoor pool, a 40,000-square-foot nightclub and a concert hall, Ovation, with 5,500 seats (Beyonce gave the inaugural concerts over Memorial Day weekend). There is also meeting space and more than a dozen restaurants run by an impressive roster of chefs. The ''Iron Chef'' Jose Garces's Distrito Cantina, an indoor Mexican food truck inspired by his popular Guapos Taco Truck in Philadelphia, is not the most highbrow among them, but it is a must. Oh, and there's a casino, too, a gorgeously designed, 130,000-square-foot one with 2,439 slot machines, 97 table games, 16 electronic tables and a poker room. One thing you will not find in Revel's casino, however, is a cloud of cigarette smoke. The property is nonsmoking, except for a small part of the Skygarden open only to HQ Nightclub guests. (Smokers have to go to the Boardwalk, the street or the public section of the beach.)
ROOM SERVICE
I called for room service just after 9 a.m., and our continental breakfast ($19) of muffins and breads, and American breakfast ($22) of scrambled eggs, bacon and potatoes arrived quickly. Friends of mine staying in another room said they had ordered late-night munchies after 2 a.m. and got similarly fast and friendly service.
BOTTOM LINE
Given the Atlantic City economy, Revel is a risky venture, but the place delivers on almost every level. This imaginative, multibillion dollar roll of the dice ought to be a winner.

HEADLINE: The Bond Market Discovers a New Leading Man

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
CORRECTION APPENDED
Newport Beach, Calif.
RECESSIONS, crackups, bailouts -- these are profitable times for Mohamed A. El-Erian.
Mr. El-Erian is the crown prince of the multitrillion-dollar global bond market, the figurative heir of its long-reigning king, William H. Gross of the mighty Pacific Investment Management Company, known as Pimco.
From the company's trading floor here in Newport Beach, some 2,500 miles from Wall Street, this odd couple, Pimco's co-chief investment officers, preside over the world's biggest bond funds -- funds where many investors turn in uncertain times.
Mr. Gross is the maestro behind the biggest of all, the $263 billion Pimco Total Return fund. But as the financial world has come unhinged -- first in 2008, with the subprime fiascoes in the United States, and now in Europe, where the debt crisis flared anew last week -- Mr. El-Erian has come into his own, stepping out of the long shadow of Mr. Gross, one of Pimco's founders and his former boss. 
On many mornings, you can spot Mr. El-Erian, who is also Pimco's chief executive, on CNBC, BBC or Bloomberg, or somewhere in the financial pages, expounding on the financial crisis of the day. He cultivates financial reporters and presses Pimco's message with flair on the conference circuit, occasionally flanked by financial illuminati like Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, as if he were an I.M.F. supremo himself rather than a fabulously wealthy money manager.
Indeed, even by the standards of Wall Street, where many financial types pull down eye-popping paychecks, Mr. El-Erian and Mr. Gross make gobs of money. Mr. El-Erian, 53, was paid about $100 million last year, according to a person with knowledge of Pimco's finances who spoke on condition of anonymity because the firm, a unit of Allianz, the big German financial company, doesn't disclose compensation.
To put that in perspective, Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase and one of the most powerful figures in American finance, got a quarter of that. Mr. Gross, 68, made about $200 million last year, according to the person with knowledge of Pimco's finances. (As for how much he and Mr. El-Erian are paid, Mr. Gross, in a joint interview with Mr. El-Erian, said only this: ''We all earn too much, but I can sleep because of the multiples we have provided for our clients over the years.'')
ON Wall Street, Mr. Gross is something of a legend, and not just because of his mega paydays. Over the last five years, Pimco Total Return has returned nearly 9.5 percent, annualized, trouncing once-celebrated stock market funds like Fidelity Magellan and even that old standby, the Vanguard 500 Index fund.
Yet Mr. El-Erian, a former I.M.F. official and an admired economic thinker, is increasingly becoming the public face of Pimco -- a one-man marketing machine for the company, its views and its agenda. Last week, for instance, as Spain's financial troubles shook world markets, Mr. El-Erian was once again in Europe -- he declined to say where -- assessing the situation. In an e-mail, he said things in Europe would get worse before they got better.
Still, the question on many minds is whether Mr. El-Erian, who previously made headlines with a brief -- and somewhat controversial -- run as the investment chief of Harvard, can possibly replicate Mr. Gross's success.
Mr. Gross, who made his first serious money at blackjack tables in Las Vegas, relishes high-stakes bets. He doesn't simply sit back and clip bond coupons; he trades, and trades well. Mr. El-Erian, by contrast, tends to be more deliberate and cerebral, a big thinker who likes to fly in the rarefied circles of global economic policy making.
''Mohamed is my heir apparent,'' Mr. Gross said in the joint interview, which took place earlier this year at Pimco's headquarters here. ''He is more conservative than I am. I am the risk taker.''
And yet Mr. El-Erian has quietly moved away from sharing power with Mr. Gross and William S. Thompson Jr., who retired not long ago as co-C.E.O. Pimco, which oversees $1.8 trillion in assets, quite simply is Mr. El-Erian's to lose.
''He is the succession plan for Bill,'' Marilyn Cohen, who runs Envision Capital Management in Los Angeles, says of Mr. El-Erian and Mr. Gross. ''I think it has worked masterfully. They have doubled-clutched it together or singularly.''
Not everyone is so enthusiastic. While Mr. El-Erian has years of experience at the I.M.F. and Pimco, some people wonder if he can successfully navigate the world's increasingly tumultuous bond markets. Unlike Mr. Gross, Mr. El-Erian isn't a trader by nature.
''Why would somebody with so little bond trading experience be in line for the top job?'' asks Sylvain R. Raynes, a co-founder of R & R Consulting in New York, which helps investors measure risks associated with bond investments. ''There are other candidates who are less flamboyant.''
Others go further. An investment executive who manages money for endowments says he is comfortable keeping funds at Pimco as long as Mr. Gross is around.
''I think once Bill is gone, we take our money away immediately,'' says the executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity so as not to jeopardize his relationship with Pimco.
But given Pimco's growth in recent years, assessing the big economic picture -- Mr. El-Erian's purview -- seems to matter more than ever. Questions of macroeconomics will have a bigger effect on a fund's performance than the particular bonds a manager picks, says Eric Jacobson, director of fixed income at Morningstar.
''El-Erian's expertise is more as a macro thinker,'' Mr. Jacobson says.
ON most mornings, Bill Gross wakes early at his beachfront home in Laguna Beach, south of here, and is on Pimco's trading desk by 6 a.m. He says he is working harder than ever and has no plans to retire anytime soon. Mr. El-Erian, he says, has energized Pimco -- and him.
Mr. Gross once used to work in a little golf in the afternoons and then return to his office. Not anymore.
''You can't help but be affected by someone who comes in at 4:30 a.m. when you are coming in at 5:30 or 6 and not know that there is an example that is being set,'' Mr. Gross says of Mr. El-Erian as the two sit at a round table in Pimco's offices.
''To some extent, I wish that I could go over and hit golf balls like I used to at 3:30, but I have not hit balls in three and a half years,'' Mr. Gross says. ''Mohamed did not tell me not to hit balls, but his behavior basically said that this is a different company moving at a faster pace.''
For all the buzz surrounding Mr. El-Erian inside and outside of Pimco, his track record for managing money is mixed.
From 1999 to 2005, as head of Pimco's Emerging Markets Bond fund, Mr. El-Erian turned in an impressive annualized return of 18.4 percent, about 3 points ahead of the competition. He turned heads with a bold call on Argentina in 1999, when Pimco, alarmed by the outlook for that country, dumped its holdings of Argentine bonds. Two years later, Argentina defaulted, and bondholders lost big.
Mr. El-Erian attracted more headlines during his time atop Harvard's endowment.
In 2006, he left Pimco to take over the university's $26 billion fund. Though it did well under his management, he quit after less than two years and returned to Pimco. The endowment subsequently faltered, and several experts on endowments criticized what they called an abrupt departure and attributed some of the fund's subsequent problems to his investment strategy.
Mr. El-Erian said that he ''cannot speak to how the endowment was managed after I handed over the reins.''
Since 2009, aside from his broad management responsibilities, Mr. El-Erian has also been a co-manager of Pimco's $5.4 billion Global Multi-Asset Fund, which is made up of other Pimco funds. Its performance has been relatively lackluster. That has also been the case at the $4.7 billion Global Advantage Strategy Bond fund, which he oversees with two other money managers.
Mr. El-Erian, who often speaks in the language of finance, says Multi-Asset delivers ''upside while hedging against sharp losses,'' while Global Advantage offers access to a ''global investment set.'' While both underperformed its peer group over the last three years, Morningstar continues to recommend them.
Certainly, Mr. El-Erian has an unusually sophisticated background, starting with a peripatetic childhood.
He was born in New York City. His father was a law professor at Cairo University. The family moved to New York when the elder Mr. El-Erian took a post at the United Nations, and then to Paris when he was named Egypt's ambassador to France. In 1973, the family moved yet again, this time to Geneva, where Mr. El-Erian's father took part in peace negotiations involving the Arab-Israeli conflict. Mohamed El-Erian later studied economics and eventually took a job at the International Monetary Fund, where he spent 15 years. He rose to become deputy director of the Middle Eastern department.
Then he departed for Wall Street, starting with a brief stint at Salomon Smith Barney. But one gray November day in London he got a call from Pimco. Would he be interested in running its emerging markets fund? He accepted and headed west.
Over the years, Mr. El-Erian has been on the radar for the top job at the I.M.F. In 2004, he was mentioned as a contender for that post, but it went to Rodrigo Rato, who served as managing director until 2007.
It was about this time that Harvard came calling. Soon, Mr. El-Erian was headed east and people were buzzing. Some wondered if he was taking the job to cultivate a relationship with Lawrence H. Summers, a former Treasury secretary who was then Harvard's president, in the hope of finally landing atop the I.M.F.
Mr. El-Erian calls such speculation ''absurd,'' adding that ''I was attracted by the combination of academia, investment management and the mission'' of the endowment.
Evaluating Mr. El-Erian's contributions at Harvard is difficult. He took over in September 2006, and in the first fiscal year that he ran the endowment it posted a strong return of 23 percent. But after less than two years at the helm, he rejoined Pimco. As the financial crisis struck and the markets reeled, Harvard's endowment fund plunged by roughly 27 percent.
While his successors at the endowment presided over the collapse, Mr. El-Erian had made several changes that, in the view of some financial experts, turned out to be ill-timed. Critics like David Salem, then head of the Investment Fund for Foundations, said that part of the problem was that Harvard had too many illiquid investments that it simply couldn't sell.
Who knows how events might have played out had Mr. El-Erian stayed at Harvard. At the time, he said his wife and daughter were unhappy in Boston and wanted to return to the West Coast.
BY the time Mr. El-Erian returned to Pimco, Mr. Gross and the co-C.E.O., Mr. Thompson, knew that they needed to line up a successor.
As Mr. Gross recalled it, ''Mohamed had left for Harvard, and there were not any local choices and we were both approaching 65.''
A year later, Mr. Thompson retired. By some accounts, his departure left a hole in Pimco -- while Mr. Gross sometimes riles employees, Mr. Thomson was Pimco's people person. ''He was the one who smoothed over ruffled feathers,'' said a former colleague of Mr. Thompson's.
Mr. Jacobson at Morningstar said, ''Now the gloves are off.''
Like Mr. Gross, Mr. El-Erian has turned up the heat on Pimco's employees. And Mr. Gross does not disagree that the atmosphere has become tougher. He said of Mr. El-Erian: ''He has a sense that for an organization to stay healthy, you have to trim the branches. I think that when Mohamed came back, there was a sense that you had to run fast.''
Pimco has always prided itself on a strong dialogue among its top money managers. The main forum is an eight-member investment committee that meets four times a week and has three rotating visitors.
One concern is whether, inside the new Pimco, people are willing to speak their minds. The firm has grown large and rich, and the temptation is to keep the bosses happy.
''That committee went from four guys in a room trying to go long or short or buy German bonds to a public forum that reminded me of students at Harvard Business School trying to get airtime,'' says a former Pimco executive who spoke on condition of anonymity because he did not want to publicly discuss his former employer. ''There is more posturing. People are trying to catch Bill's attention.''
Mr. El-Erian counters that Pimco's culture rewards people who challenge conventional wisdom.
One important change was the departure in 2010 of Paul A. McCulley, a managing director and, in effect, Pimco's chief economist. Mr. McCulley's work helped prepare Pimco for the financial crisis in 2008.
Mr. El-Erian himself offered his views on the global economy in a well-received 2008 book, ''When Markets Collide.'' In Mr. Gross's view, Mr. El-Erian is now the one to listen to at Pimco.
''I think that Mohamed, with his experience with the I.M.F. and his history and his knowledge of sovereigns and how it plays out and having been a participant, has kind of taken Paul's place in terms of focusing the investment committee on the big issues,'' Mr. Gross says. ''Do we miss Paul? Yes. But we have picked up the slack, I think.''
Mr. El-Erian adds, ''We always knew that Pimco would have to navigate the generation changes.''
If last week's financial turmoil is any guide, it will have to navigate more wild markets, too.

HEADLINE: Daniel Hendrick, Jimmy Van Bramer

BYLINE: By VINCENT M. MALLOZZI

 BODY:
Daniel M. Hendrick and Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer were married Saturday evening at Studio Square, an event space in Long Island City, Queens. Audrey I. Pheffer, the Queens County Clerk, officiated.
Mr. Hendrick (left), 41, works in Manhattan as the communications director for the New York League of Conservation Voters, an environmental advocacy group. He graduated from Columbia University.
He is the son of Elizabeth L. Hendrick of Fraser, Mich., and Daniel W. Hendrick, of Largo, Fla. His mother retired as a laboratory supervisor at St. John Macomb-Oakland Hospital in Warren, Mich. His father retired as a fire marshal for Chrysler and worked in Detroit. 
Mr. Van Bramer, 42, is a member of the New York City Council representing the 26th District, which is composed of Long Island City, Sunnyside, Woodside, Astoria and Maspeth in Queens. He is also the chairman of the council's Cultural Affairs and Libraries Committee. He graduated from St. John's University.
He is a son of Elizabeth E. Marcum of Astoria and William R. Van Bramer of Vero Beach, Fla. His mother retired as a cashier and a meat wrapper at a Pathmark supermarket in Long Island City. His father retired as a pressman for The New York Times and as an executive board member of New York Pressman's Union, Local 2.
Mr. Van Bramer is a stepson of the late James E. Marcum. His stepfather retired as a custodian from Intermediate School 10 in Astoria.
Mr. Hendrick and Mr. Van Bramer met in May 1999 at a fund-raiser for a gay community center in Queens. (At the time, Mr. Van Bramer was working in government relations for the Queens Borough Public Library and Mr. Hendrick wrote news releases for the Fitch Ratings agency.)
Mr. Van Bramer, having just arrived, went to the bar for a glass of wine when he looked up and saw Mr. Hendrick. ''He was this handsome redhead with glasses,'' Mr. Van Bramer recalled. ''I just kind of said to myself 'Who is that?' ''
Mr. Hendrick was soon chatting with the man who had invited Mr. Van Bramer to the fund-raiser, leading Mr. Van Bramer to assume that the two were dating. A short time later, the friend told Mr. Van Bramer that he was not dating Mr. Hendrick, and he had more good news: Mr. Hendrick had asked about Mr. Van Bramer (''Who is the guy in the suit?'').
Mr. Van Bramer approached Mr. Hendrick and very soon began a mental survey of his new acquaintance.
''As we were standing there talking, I went through my checklist,'' Mr. Van Bramer said. ''I thought, 'He's good looking, he's smart, he's employed and he's able to talk about politics.' He met every one of my requirements.''
Mr. Hendrick also had a checklist.
''I thought he was sweet, handsome, intelligent and above all, I really loved his political activism,'' Mr. Hendrick said. ''He wanted to make some changes in the world.''
That conversation led to a first date at a movie theater in Queens, and they began dating steadily, with Mr. Hendrick, who lived in Long Island City, spending time at Mr. Van Bramer's studio in Woodside. Though Mr. Van Bramer wanted them to live together, he did not want to appear desperate.
''Every time he would leave a shirt behind or a toothbrush, I thought that was a good sign that he was leaning toward moving in,'' Mr. Van Bramer said.
Then one day, Mr. Hendrick brought over one of his most treasured possessions, a sugar bowl that he had bought in Siberia during a college trip.
The sugar bowl, which Mr. Hendrick put on the kitchen counter, never made it back to Long Island City, and neither did Mr. Hendrick, who moved in shortly thereafter. VINCENT M. MALLOZZI
Correction: August 5, 2012, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A report last Sunday about the marriage of Daniel M. Hendrick and Jimmy Van Bramer, a New York City councilman, misspelled the councilman's surname in a number of references. It is Van Bramer, not Van Bremer.

HEADLINE: Jersey? Sure

BYLINE: By LIZZY GOODMAN

 BODY:
Brian Fallon, the scruffy frontman for the Gaslight Anthem, keeps a notebook in which he writes down major events in the band's history. ''It's one sentence -- like, this happened here,'' he says. For example, an entry from June 2009: Bruce Springsteen joins the band onstage at the Glastonbury Festival in England. Fallon was walking up the ramp to the stage when Springsteen grabbed his shoulder and asked if he could play with them on ''that ' '59 Sound' song,'' the title track from the band's breakthrough album. ''I think I know the chords!'' he told Fallon. It was the Jersey-rock version of being knighted. ''We got offstage, '' Fallon remembers, ''and I said to myself, 'I don't think people will view us the same after this.' ''
The next night, Springsteen was playing an outdoor concert in Hyde Park, and he invited Fallon onstage to sing with him. ''I've never seen Bruce with a bigger smile on his face singing with a young man,'' says the rock historian Matt Pinfield, a fellow Jersey boy and Gaslight fan. ''Because even Bruce knows Brian's the heir apparent.'' 
Since forming in the mid-2000s, the Gaslight Anthem has emerged as everyone's favorite rock 'n' roll underdog. This month the band released ''Handwritten,'' its fourth album and first for a major label. The album is steeped in Gaslight's signature blend of soulful punk. But it also reaches/ for the all-American classic-rock anthems that the band has been hinting at for years.
The guys in Gaslight have the easy intimacy that comes from having spent years together in an Econoline van. ''Remember how much money none of us had at that point?'' Fallon asked the guitarist Alex Rosamilia recently on the patio of a pub off Main Street in Red Bank, N.J. He was talking about the making of ''The '59 Sound'' in 2008. They recorded it in Los Angeles while living in a complex in Burbank that also housed lots of ''beautiful and too confident'' child actors, recalled the drummer, Benny Horowitz. Those were the years when the band drove to the next night's gig on the previous night's earnings; they were on the road so much that Horowitz didn't even bother renting an apartment. ''We watched 'Talladega Nights' every night for two years,'' Fallon recalled. ''That movie was the only normal thing we had.''
Fallon was once memorably described as a punk-rock Woody Allen. It's an incongruous image: from his blond stubble to his full sleeves of tattoos, Fallon, who is 32, looks every bit the Irish construction worker he was before Gaslight took off. Yet he has the comic timing of a Catskill tummler. At one point in the pub, Horowitz announced that he gave up on fashion when he was 12: ''I've just been wearing the same thing since then.'' Rosamilia jumped in: ''Literally, he's been wearing the same exact shirt.'' And Fallon then noted, ''Well, it looks amazing.''
Fallon is an only child, born and raised in Red Bank not far from where he lives now. His mother works for a local hospital, and his stepfather worked in a factory. The family rules were simple: go to church, work hard, don't swear. With the exception of cigarettes and an unholy amount of Coca-Cola, he appears to have few vices. He barely drinks, doesn't do drugs, says ''gosh'' with a straight face and attends church on Sundays. ''People always burn me about this,'' Fallon said of his faith. ''I know that most people today don't believe in anything,'' he told me. ''I don't expect them to. I get that they think I'm weird.'' Recently, he said in an interview with a German music magazine that he believes in creationism. People ''started freaking out, saying I don't believe in dinosaurs and I'm such a fool,'' he said. ''But you say you're a religious person, and it's on, bonfire is lit. I thought we're supposed to live in a tolerant society.''
What distresses Fallon the most is that people assume he's intolerant. Fallon's wife, Hollie, is a Jewish girl from the Bronx, and he is a vocal supporter of gay rights and women's rights. ''Bruce has this expression he says all the time: 'Nobody wins unless everybody wins,' and I really think that's true,'' Fallon says. ''When I was working construction or in a gas station listening to Bruce Springsteen songs, I felt like I'd won, too.''
We drove from Red Bank to the shore in Fallon's new muscle car, a black Dodge Challenger, and he slowed down and pointed to the median, where there used to be some kind of Springsteen tribute. ''Right there on that rock,'' he said. ''It was his head from 'Born in the U.S.A.' made out of stone with the bandanna and everything.'' He started to laugh. ''I was like, Why is that there? I don't want people doing that to me. I don't want to be the mayor of New Jersey.''
But he does know what his band has come to mean to people back home, and he takes that responsibility seriously. ''You can't forget them,'' he told me. ''You almost have to sing and write for them. You kind of become in some aspects a hope for them. I'm more talking about Bruce than me. I don't feel like I'm anybody's hope yet.''
And there was a period when Fallon thought he might leave New Jersey altogether. Hollie missed New York, and after the success of ''The '59 Sound,'' things in Jersey ''got weird for a minute,'' as Fallon put it. ''People I grew up with started thinking we thought we were so great. It freaked us out.'' He also knew he needed to write another record, and Brooklyn seemed like the right kind of blank slate. He and Hollie rented a place on Union Street, in the middle of leafy, cultured Park Slope. He quickly realized it didn't suit him -- everybody had ''a thing'' or ''a scheme.'' ''They've all got a thing that they've almost rehearsed in the mirror.'' The sense of unease colored the record Fallon wrote while living there, ''American Slang,'' which came out in 2010. He moved back to Red Bank, bought a house and a car (and a motorcycle). His life, he said, was very simple. ''You pay your bills and you take care of your family or you're not a man,'' Fallon explained. ''I know in Brooklyn it's not culturally accepted to think that way, 'cause it's like, why do you have to be the man? But I don't get mixed up in those gymnastics.''
Fallon thinks a lot about doing what's right, but he is the singer of a punk band, after all. What's right isn't necessarily what's legal. While driving around Red Bank, we were idling at a red light near the water when he flicked his cigarette out the window. ''You wanna go real fast for two seconds?'' he asked. I nodded. He looked left and right. And then the tires squealed, and for 10 heart-stopping seconds we were both pinned to our seats, racing down the Jersey Shore.

HEADLINE: Political Fortunetelling

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI

 BODY:
TALK about putting the cart ahead of the donkey. Last week Public Policy Polling actually sized up voters' feelings about possible Democratic candidates for... the 2016 presidential race. That's right: 2016. The 2012 contest still has two conventions, one vice-presidential selection, four debates and a river delta's worth of mudslinging to go, and already the soothsayers are moving on. Either we Americans are an admirably future-oriented people, or we're really, really bored.
The polling firm surveyed voters in Iowa, site of those wild and woolly caucuses, and found that they preferred Hillary Clinton to Joe Biden by a 42-point margin. You'll be hard pressed to believe this, but on the Republican side, which the firm also assessed, things were messier, with Rick Santorum and Mike Huckabee so close they might as well be tucked into the same sweater vest. 
Those findings came out Monday. On Tuesday news reports noted that Jeb Bush would be giving a speech this fall in Iowa -- which can mean only one thing! -- and that the Colorado governor, John Hickenlooper, a popular Democrat, had made plans for a summer trip to New Hampshire, verdant cradle of so many a presidential dream. Any day now, I expect Intrade odds for a Bush-Hickenlooper general-election contest, along with a raft of commentary on the implications of a matchup even more syllabically skewed than Bush-Dukakis. Can the longer clump of letters win?
And if we extrapolate just a bit from current trends and add a soupcon of imagination, can't we see even further into the future? Let's give it a try.
In the 2020 Republican primary, there are brief surges each by Marco Rubio, Rand Paul and the comedian Dennis Miller. For three weeks, Sarah Palin sends coy signals of a possible candidacy; those weeks happen to coincide with the debut of her Wasilla lounge act, ''Rock & Rogue,'' and the rollout of a signature eyewear collection at LensCrafters nationwide.
Michele Bachmann attempts a comeback, enabled by a continued erosion of campaign finance regulations. Corporations can now formally sponsor like-minded candidates, and a fast-food chain known for its evangelical bent backs her, leading to bumper stickers and T-shirts that say: ''Bachmann 2020, Brought to You by Chick-fil-A.''
But the primary ultimately comes down to dueling dauphins. It's George P. Bush (son of Jeb) versus Tagg Romney (son of Mitt), whose catchy campaign slogan, ''Tagg: You're It!'' gives him an early lead. That advantage is erased when, on a trip to Brazil meant to showcase his foreign-policy bona fides, he alienates the entire country with a profession of admiration for what he mistakenly assumes to be its national anthem, ''The Girl From Ipanema.'' And so Romney, brought to you by the Marriott International Inc., narrowly loses to Bush, brought to you by Koch Industries.
He faces a Democratic incumbent, Andrew Cuomo, brought to you by the Food Network, which has grown at this point to eight channels of programming, three devoted to the ultra-processed, ''semi-homemade'' cooking of Cuomo's significant other, Sandra Lee.
Cuomo promises that if semi-enthusiastic voters give him a second term, he and Lee will at last tie the knot. He also assures voters that he will never again let her choose the menu for a state dinner or come anywhere near the food pyramid, which, under her influence, has begun to resemble something more like a food trapezoid. He prevails.
The 2024 Democratic primary is an inter-dynastic echo of the 2020 Republican one, pitting Beau Biden (son of Joe) against Chelsea Clinton (lineage well known). Solidifying the Democratic Party's lucrative connection to Hollywood, Clinton says that she plans to make George Clooney her secretary of state. Biden one-ups her -- and seals his primary win -- by pledging the two-for-one appointment of Brangelina to that post, on the correct theory that the couple's expansive brood of adopted children alone can provide him his margin of victory at the polls.
The Republican field is utter madness, even if you don't factor in Palin's latest faux flirtation with a candidacy. It coincides with the debut of her new reality show, ''Sarah at Sixty: A Tundra of Fun.''
George P. Bush winds up getting the nod again. The Biden vs. Bush general-election face-off is the most expensive ever, with a total of $50 billion in spending by the campaigns, the parties, various ''super PACs'' and three unidentified men from Beijing hoisting steamer trunks of cash off the baggage carousel at J.F.K. When Bush points out that he has added more than 250,000 jobs to the economy through his hiring of ad makers, opposition researchers, telemarketers and assemblers of George P. Bush action figurines, voters gratefully elect him.
By 2036, campaigns have turned so negative and shallow that candidates don't even bother with policies; they just exchange dismissive emoticons on a new, wordless social media platform. The Republican incumbent, Andrew Rove, flings eye rolls, yawns and -- in a homage to the president his father helped elect -- an occasional smirk.
Rove's Democratic opponent, Malia Obama, favors hopey-changey faces and expressions of grit.
The only two traditional news periodicals still in operation publish frequent laments about the tyranny of name recognition, nepotism and family wealth in American government, noting that Rove's commerce secretary is Craig Romney; his education secretary is Ben Quayle; his labor secretary is Ivanka Trump; and his secretary of defense is Meghan McCain. The potent sway of such journalism is reflected in Obama's choice of a running mate: Kristin Gore.
Presidential debates no longer exist, replaced by a jingoistic televised competition, ''The Patriot Game,'' that tests candidates' love of country and belief in American exceptionalism. The judges Miley Cyrus and Justin Bieber favor Obama's a cappella version of ''My Country, 'Tis of Thee'' to Rove's hip-hop interpretation of ''This Land Is Your Land.''
Obama and Rove perform equally well in the ''America Is Better Than Europe Because'' segment, each getting 100 percent of the ''true or false'' questions correct. But in the ''American Superlatives'' category, Rove stumbles. While he correctly names the United States as the fattest country on earth and as the one with the most handguns per household, he denies it its rightful recognition as the major democracy with, at this point, the lowest voter turnout.
Regardless, the White House at long last goes to a third-party candidate, who benefits from both Republican and Democratic bloodlines. In January 2037, the oath of office is taken by Patrick Arnold Shriver Schwarzenegger.

HEADLINE: Doctor Shortage Likely To Worsen With Health Law

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY and ROBERT PEAR; Annie Lowrey reported from Riverside, and Robert Pear from Washington.

 BODY:
RIVERSIDE, Calif. -- In the Inland Empire, an economically depressed region in Southern California, President Obama's health care law is expected to extend insurance coverage to more than 300,000 people by 2014. But coverage will not necessarily translate into care: Local health experts doubt there will be enough doctors to meet the area's needs. There are not enough now.
Other places around the country, including the Mississippi Delta, Detroit and suburban Phoenix, face similar problems. The Association of American Medical Colleges estimates that in 2015 the country will have 62,900 fewer doctors than needed. And that number will more than double by 2025, as the expansion of insurance coverage and the aging of baby boomers drive up demand for care. Even without the health care law, the shortfall of doctors in 2025 would still exceed 100,000.
Health experts, including many who support the law, say there is little that the government or the medical profession will be able to do to close the gap by 2014, when the law begins extending coverage to about 30 million Americans. It typically takes a decade to train a doctor. 
''We have a shortage of every kind of doctor, except for plastic surgeons and dermatologists,'' said Dr. G. Richard Olds, the dean of the new medical school at the University of California, Riverside, founded in part to address the region's doctor shortage. ''We'll have a 5,000-physician shortage in 10 years, no matter what anybody does.''
Experts describe a doctor shortage as an ''invisible problem.'' Patients still get care, but the process is often slow and difficult. In Riverside, it has left residents driving long distances to doctors, languishing on waiting lists, overusing emergency rooms and even forgoing care.
''It results in delayed care and higher levels of acuity,'' said Dustin Corcoran, the chief executive of the California Medical Association, which represents 35,000 physicians. People ''access the health care system through the emergency department, rather than establishing a relationship with a primary care physician who might keep them from getting sicker.''
In the Inland Empire, encompassing the counties of Riverside and San Bernardino, the shortage of doctors is already severe. The population of Riverside County swelled 42 percent in the 2000s, gaining more than 644,000 people. It has continued to grow despite the collapse of one of the country's biggest property bubbles and a jobless rate of 11.8 percent in the Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario metro area.
But the growth in the number of physicians has lagged, in no small part because the area has trouble attracting doctors, who might make more money and prefer living in nearby Orange County or Los Angeles.
A government council has recommended that a given region have 60 to 80 primary care doctors per 100,000 residents, and 85 to 105 specialists. The Inland Empire has about 40 primary care doctors and 70 specialists per 100,000 residents -- the worst shortage in California, in both cases.
Moreover, across the country, fewer than half of primary care clinicians were accepting new Medicaid patients as of 2008, making it hard for the poor to find care even when they are eligible for Medicaid. The expansion of Medicaid accounts for more than one-third of the overall growth in coverage in President Obama's health care law.
Providers say they are bracing for the surge of the newly insured into an already strained system.
Temetry Lindsey, the chief executive of Inland Behavioral & Health Services, which provides medical care to about 12,000 area residents, many of them low income, said she was speeding patient-processing systems, packing doctors' schedules tighter and seeking to hire more physicians.
''We know we are going to be overrun at some point,'' Ms. Lindsey said, estimating that the clinics would see new demand from 10,000 to 25,000 residents by 2014. She added that hiring new doctors had proved a struggle, in part because of the ''stigma'' of working in this part of California.
Across the country, a factor increasing demand, along with expansion of coverage in the law and simple population growth, is the aging of the baby boom generation. Medicare officials predict that enrollment will surge to 73.2 million in 2025, up 44 percent from 50.7 million this year.
''Older Americans require significantly more health care,'' said Dr. Darrell G. Kirch, the president of the Association of American Medical Colleges. ''Older individuals are more likely to have multiple chronic conditions, requiring more intensive, coordinated care.''
The pool of doctors has not kept pace, and will not, health experts said. Medical school enrollment is increasing, but not as fast as the population. The number of training positions for medical school graduates is lagging. Younger doctors are on average working fewer hours than their predecessors. And about a third of the country's doctors are 55 or older, and nearing retirement.
Physician compensation is also an issue. The proportion of medical students choosing to enter primary care has declined in the past 15 years, as average earnings for primary care doctors and specialists, like orthopedic surgeons and radiologists, have diverged. A study by the Medical Group Management Association found that in 2010, primary care doctors made about $200,000 a year. Specialists often made twice as much.
The Obama administration has sought to ease the shortage. The health care law increases Medicaid's primary care payment rates in 2013 and 2014. It also includes money to train new primary care doctors, reward them for working in underserved communities and strengthen community health centers.
But the provisions within the law are expected to increase the number of primary care doctors by perhaps 3,000 in the coming decade. Communities around the country need about 45,000.
Many health experts in California said that while they welcomed the expansion of coverage, they expected that the state simply would not be ready for the new demand. ''It's going to be necessary to use the resources that we have smarter'' in light of the doctor shortages, said Dr. Mark D. Smith, who heads the California HealthCare Foundation, a nonprofit group.
Dr. Smith said building more walk-in clinics, allowing nurses to provide more care and encouraging doctors to work in teams would all be part of the answer. Mr. Corcoran of the California Medical Association also said the state would need to stop cutting Medicaid payment rates; instead, it needed to increase them to make seeing those patients economically feasible for doctors.
More doctors might be part of the answer as well. The U.C. Riverside medical school is hoping to enroll its first students in August 2013, and is planning a number of policies to encourage its graduates to stay in the area and practice primary care.
But Dr. Olds said changing how doctors provided care would be more important than minting new doctors. ''I'm only adding 22 new students to this equation,'' he said. ''That's not enough to put a dent in a 5,000-doctor shortage.''

HEADLINE: Obama's Team Taking Gamble Going Negative

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

 BODY:
CHICAGO -- As President Obama pushes Mitt Romney to release more of his tax returns, a television commercial from his campaign bluntly says, ''Makes you wonder if some years he's paid any taxes at all.'' In another spot, Mr. Obama's campaign stops short of calling the Republican a tax cheat, but stirs suspicion by declaring, ''Romney's used every trick in the book.''
With 100 days remaining before Election Day, there is an air of apprehension around the Obama campaign headquarters here. Yet there are few regrets about the tone of the race, only a conviction that the circumstances -- a frail economy, intense Republican opposition and a well-financed negative campaign from Mr. Romney and his allies -- left Mr. Obama no option but to fight back even if it sullies his image as a candidate of hope and change.
''Is it a different kind of race than 2008? Of course,'' said David Axelrod, a senior campaign strategist. ''If we were passive in the face of this onslaught we are facing, our folks would be unhappy. There are few on our side who are counseling us to sit idly by.'' 
Mr. Romney and his allies are giving as good as they get, lacerating Mr. Obama as hapless in promoting job creation, feckless with allies like Israel and determined to expand government until the United States resembles Sweden.
As the campaigns prepare for the next phase of the race, the two sides are taking stock of what they have achieved in their first sustained engagement, a relentlessly negative effort over the last two months to define the other. The exchanges have been so fierce that hardly a positive ad has been broadcast in July.
But both the opportunities and the risks in the definition wars are greater for Mr. Obama. Mr. Romney is less well known to the public, giving Democrats a chance to shape perceptions of him just as more voters are starting to tune in to the race.
The president's prospects for re-election now rest in part on one of the biggest gambles of his career: that the benefits of trying to eviscerate Mr. Romney outweigh the costs to his own image and reputation.
With a political climate ripe for unseating an incumbent, the president's campaign team signaled long ago that it had no intention of trying to replicate the 2008 race, and made it clear last year that if Mr. Romney won the Republican nomination, they would rush to aggressively define him before turning to a forward-looking message in the fall.
Mr. Obama, whose competitive and confident streaks seem to have been rekindled by the challenge from Mr. Romney, has shown no inclination to hold back in trying to portray his rival as a secretive Bush-era throwback whose wealth puts him out of touch with the middle class.
The president not only approves of his television ads, as federal election law requires him to say in each commercial, he also screens many of them in advance, either on his iPad or during a regular Sunday evening meeting with political advisers at the White House.
Fearful of the tone becoming too shrill, he took the rare step of speaking directly to the camera in a new ad that elevates the conversation, a hint of his approach when the campaign moves beyond summer.
''Sometimes politics can seem very small,'' Mr. Obama said, sounding almost apologetic. ''But the choice you face, it couldn't be bigger.''
His aides wondered in particular whether a recent spot showing Mr. Romney singing ''America the Beautiful,'' while headlines about outsourcing and overseas bank accounts flashed, was too negative. The president and some of his strategists were unsure, aides said, but a focus group of voters found it to be fair. They still tested the ad again before showing it.
The ratio of negative ads, which are defined as those in which a campaign mentions its rival by name, tells the story. Since April, after Mr. Romney became the presumptive nominee, Mr. Obama broadcast negative commercials 118,775 times compared with 56,128 times for positive commercials.
In the same time period, Mr. Romney ran negative spots 51,973 times and positive spots 11,921, according to an analysis from Kantar Media, which tracks political advertising. This does not include the Republican ''super PAC'' ads that are almost entirely attacks on the president.
''President Obama was keeping a more balanced mix, but by the end of June he turned off the positive spigot,'' said Elizabeth Wilner, who studies advertising for the group.
Polls suggest that voters might be starting to view Mr. Obama less favorably even as the race remains tight. And while it is hard to know whether the shift is related to the tone of his campaign, his advisers are acutely mindful that one of Mr. Obama's key attributes, that voters generally like him, must be preserved to win over the undecided voters who will determine the race.
But if Mr. Obama prevails, it will almost certainly be because his team executed a plan to try to win the race in the summer to make Mr. Romney unacceptable to voters by the fall. It is a page from the 2004 playbook of President George W. Bush, whose campaign spent the same period relentlessly defining Senator John Kerry as unreliable.
Matthew Dowd, a former Republican strategist who was a top adviser on the Bush re-election campaign, refers to it as ''poisoning the water table.'' The parallels between 2004 and 2012 are striking, he said, with the Obama campaign putting its stamp on Mr. Romney before he introduces himself to voters.
''President Obama and his campaign have made the determination that the only way they can win this race is to create a negative impression of Mitt Romney,'' said Mr. Dowd, now an independent analyst. ''When people go to vote, even if they don't like the direction of the country, they may not trust Mitt Romney.''
Republicans are trying to seize on the tone of the campaign and turn it against the president, with a recent ad titled, ''Whatever happened to hope and change?''
Still, the respective Republican groups have spent far less time either introducing Mr. Romney or defending him. Some party leaders now wonder whether that was a mistake, given that the questions about his tax returns or his time at Bain Capital have become ubiquitous.
But despite tens of millions of dollars spent on ads this summer, the race remains essentially deadlocked. The Romney campaign is within striking distance in nearly every battleground state, aides to both campaigns say, with the president still holding more paths to reaching the 270 electoral votes needed.
While Mr. Obama rose through the ranks with a clarion call for a new kind of politics, there is little noticeable criticism about the tenor of the race from longtime supporters.
''There is no question the atmosphere is different than the last campaign. It has to be,'' said Judd Miner, a Chicago lawyer who has known the president for two decades and still refers to him by his first name. ''We learned the hard way with Kerry. It matters that Barack wins.''

HEADLINE: Where the Other Guy Won't Be Going

BYLINE: By JACOB BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
EACH summer for the last three years, President Barack Obama and his family have headed to Martha's Vineyard in August for a couple of weeks of vacation. He has golfed with friends like Vernon Jordan and Robert Wolf, eaten seafood at Nancy's Restaurant and gone shopping for books at the Bunch of Grapes (purchases, according to Politico, included ''Rodin's Debutante'' and ''The Bayou Trilogy''). All and all, pretty much the way many people spend their time off, except that in this case the vacationer in question comes with hundreds of Secret Service people and a fairly sizable press corps. 
This year, however, in the midst of a tight battle for re-election, the president decided to forgo his two weeks off, freeing up hotel rooms and restaurant space that would otherwise have been gobbled up by his retinue. The effect of his absence on the local island economy varies according to whom you speak to, but as this is the high season, no one is exactly panicking.
''It definitely helps the economy when they come,'' said Steven Ansara, a manager at Nancy's. ''They're really nice people, they don't disrupt the restaurant too much, they bring press corps and people to see them. Some people stay away because of the traffic, but overall it's a good thing.'' (He added that the Obamas like their oysters and fried seafood, but declined to provide The New York Times with a detailed list of items ordered during their previous visits.)
Joanie Levine, a reservationist at the Wesley Hotel, remembers a certain ka-ching factor from the president's last visit. ''We have 95 rooms here, and 70 rooms were taken by Secret Service people for roughly two weeks,'' she said. Ms. Levine hadn't seen the final tab, but with rooms going for an average of $255 a night, some basic math gets it to almost a quarter of a million dollars (excluding discounts) before a single cup of coffee is served.
President Obama, of course, is not the only occupant of the White House to have stayed on Martha's Vineyard. For the last two decades, Bill and Hillary Clinton have also been frequent visitors to the island; some residents see Mr. Clinton as more sociable than Mr. Obama.
''Clinton liked to go to the ice cream shop and shake everyone's hand, he went to the fair, he came to the Black Dog,'' said Martha Luce, who works at the Black Dog Tavern, one of the Island's big tourist destinations. ''The Obamas weren't nearly as out and about.''
But Nelson Sigelman, managing editor of The Martha's Vineyard Times, was inclined to be understanding about this. ''Everybody's different in the way they enjoy their vacation,'' Mr. Sigelman said. ''When I go on vacation I like to go fishing. Clinton was very gregarious. President Obama tended to spend time with friends in more intimate settings. He appears to be a more private person.''

HEADLINE: Mitt's Olympic Meddle

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
SO the Republican presidential contender, eager to show off more than gubernatorial experience, travels overseas to bolster his foreign policy credentials. Then, in a TV interview, he blurts out a shockingly ill-considered, if undeniably true, observation that snowballs until the poor guy collapses into an international punch line.
It was a vertiginous fall for George Romney, who, while running for president in 1967, asserted that generals and diplomats had given him ''the greatest brainwashing that anybody can get'' when he toured Vietnam two years earlier. 
And it was painful for Mitt, who had to watch his father's epic gaffe from afar, while he was over in France struggling to drum up a few Mormon converts.
In their book ''The Real Romney,'' Michael Kranish and Scott Helman quoted Mitt's sister Jane as saying the episode deeply affected Mitt: ''He's not going to put himself out on a limb. He's more cautious, more scripted.''
That's when Mitt began to build his own sterile biosphere, shaping his temperament and political career to make sure he never stumbled into such a costly moment of candor.
Even though the Mormon doesn't drink coffee, he has measured out his life in coffee spoons, limiting access to reporters, giving interviews mostly to Fox News, hiding personal data, resisting putting out concrete policy proposals, refusing to release tax returns, trimming his conscience to match the moment, avoiding spontaneity. But somehow he ended up making the same unforced error that his dad did.
It's like the epigraph in John O'Hara's ''Appointment at Samarra.'' You can run from fate, but fate will be waiting in the next town, at the next marketplace.
Even as he angled to appear Anglo-Saxon and obsequiously vowed to restore the bust of Churchill to the Oval Office, Mitt condescended to the nation that invented condescension. The Brits swiftly boxed his ears for his insolence and foul calumny.
Conservatives in London oozed scorn. Mayor Boris Johnson mocked ''a guy called Mitt Romney,'' and Prime Minister David Cameron suggested it was easier to run an Olympics ''in the middle of nowhere.'' Fleet Street spanked ''Nowhere Man'' and ''Mitt the Twit.''
Conservatives on Fox News were dumbfounded. ''You have to shake your head,'' Karl Rove said. Charles Krauthammer pronounced the faux pas ''unbelievable, it's beyond human understanding, it's incomprehensible. I'm out of adjectives.''
The alarming thing about Romney is that he has been running for president for years, but he still doesn't know how to read a room. He doesn't take anything in, he just puts it out. He doesn't hear himself the way the rest of us hear him.
In the Mitt-sphere, populated by his shiny white family, the Mormon Church and a narrow, homogenous inner circle, Romney's image of himself as wise, caring, smart and capable is relentlessly reinforced. That leaves him constantly surprised that other people don't love what he is saying.
We may wince when the blithering toff, or want-wit, as Shakespeare would say, arrives at the Brits' home and throws his Cherry Coke Zero can in the prize rose bushes. But what drives his gaffes is his desire to preen over accomplishments.
As a candidate, he's expected to stoop to conquer, to play a man of the people. But he really wants voters to know that he earned $250 million, and not even in the same business where his dad made a name for himself.
So he keeps blurting out hoity-toity stuff to make sure we know he's not hoi polloi -- about his friends who are Nascar owners, his wife's Cadillacs, how he likes to fire people and how he, too, is unemployed. And he builds a car elevator in the middle of an economic slough.
In his interview with Brian Williams in London, Romney couldn't resist giving himself the laurels for saving the Salt Lake City Games by analyzing whether the British ones were off by a hair, or a hire.
Then he tried to scamper back to the obligatory common-man script and ended up looking clumsy and the one thing he most certainly is not: unuxorious.
After going all the way to London to see the Olympics, he decides he won't watch his wife's mare, Rafalca, compete in horse ballet? He tries to win the political horse race by going to the Games, which are literally a race in which he has a horse, and then feigns disengagement?
''This is Ann's sport,'' Romney told Williams dismissively. ''I'm not even sure which day the sport goes on. She will get the chance to see it. I will not be watching the event.''
He came across like a wazzock, as The Daily Telegraph called him, using a British insult for a daft know-it-all.
Romney programmed himself into a robot, so he wouldn't boil over with opinions and convictions, like his more genuine dad.
But if we're going to have someone who's removed, always struggling to connect and emote, why not stick with the president we already have?
Better the android you know than the android you don't know.

HEADLINE: Poverty in America: Why Can't We End It?

BYLINE: By PETER EDELMAN. 
A professor of law at Georgetown University and the author, most recently, of ''So Rich, So Poor: Why It's So Hard to End Poverty in America.''

 BODY:
RONALD REAGAN famously said, ''We fought a war on poverty and poverty won.'' With 46 million Americans -- 15 percent of the population -- now counted as poor, it's tempting to think he may have been right.
Look a little deeper and the temptation grows. The lowest percentage in poverty since we started counting was 11.1 percent in 1973. The rate climbed as high as 15.2 percent in 1983. In 2000, after a spurt of prosperity, it went back down to 11.3 percent, and yet 15 million more people are poor today.
At the same time, we have done a lot that works. From Social Security to food stamps to the earned-income tax credit and on and on, we have enacted programs that now keep 40 million people out of poverty. Poverty would be nearly double what it is now without these measures, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. To say that ''poverty won'' is like saying the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts failed because there is still pollution. 
With all of that, why have we not achieved more? Four reasons: An astonishing number of people work at low-wage jobs. Plus, many more households are headed now by a single parent, making it difficult for them to earn a living income from the jobs that are typically available. The near disappearance of cash assistance for low-income mothers and children -- i.e., welfare -- in much of the country plays a contributing role, too. And persistent issues of race and gender mean higher poverty among minorities and families headed by single mothers.
The first thing needed if we're to get people out of poverty is more jobs that pay decent wages. There aren't enough of these in our current economy. The need for good jobs extends far beyond the current crisis; we'll need a full-employment policy and a bigger investment in 21st-century education and skill development strategies if we're to have any hope of breaking out of the current economic malaise.
This isn't a problem specific to the current moment. We've been drowning in a flood of low-wage jobs for the last 40 years. Most of the income of people in poverty comes from work. According to the most recent data available from the Census Bureau, 104 million people -- a third of the population -- have annual incomes below twice the poverty line, less than $38,000 for a family of three. They struggle to make ends meet every month.
Half the jobs in the nation pay less than $34,000 a year, according to the Economic Policy Institute. A quarter pay below the poverty line for a family of four, less than $23,000 annually. Families that can send another adult to work have done better, but single mothers (and fathers) don't have that option. Poverty among families with children headed by single mothers exceeds 40 percent.
Wages for those who work on jobs in the bottom half have been stuck since 1973, increasing just 7 percent.
It's not that the whole economy stagnated. There's been growth, a lot of it, but it has stuck at the top. The realization that 99 percent of us have been left in the dust by the 1 percent at the top (some much further behind than others) came far later than it should have -- Rip Van Winkle and then some. It took the Great Recession to get people's attention, but the facts had been accumulating for a long time. If we've awakened, we can act.
Low-wage jobs bedevil tens of millions of people. At the other end of the low-income spectrum we have a different problem. The safety net for single mothers and their children has developed a gaping hole over the past dozen years. This is a major cause of the dramatic increase in extreme poverty during those years. The census tells us that 20.5 million people earn incomes below half the poverty line, less than about $9,500 for a family of three -- up eight million from 2000.
Why? A substantial reason is the near demise of welfare -- now called Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF. In the mid-90s more than two-thirds of children in poor families received welfare. But that number has dwindled over the past decade and a half to roughly 27 percent.
One result: six million people have no income other than food stamps. Food stamps provide an income at a third of the poverty line, close to $6,300 for a family of three. It's hard to understand how they survive.
At least we have food stamps. They have been a powerful antirecession tool in the past five years, with the number of recipients rising to 46 million today from 26.3 million in 2007. By contrast, welfare has done little to counter the impact of the recession; although the number of people receiving cash assistance rose from 3.9 million to 4.5 million since 2007, many states actually reduced the size of their rolls and lowered benefits to those in greatest need.
Race and gender play an enormous part in determining poverty's continuing course. Minorities are disproportionately poor: around 27 percent of African-Americans, Latinos and American Indians are poor, versus 10 percent of whites. Wealth disparities are even wider. At the same time, whites constitute the largest number among the poor. This is a fact that bears emphasis, since measures to raise income and provide work supports will help more whites than minorities. But we cannot ignore race and gender, both because they present particular challenges and because so much of the politics of poverty is grounded in those issues.
We know what we need to do -- make the rich pay their fair share of running the country, raise the minimum wage, provide health care and a decent safety net, and the like. But realistically, the immediate challenge is keeping what we have. Representative Paul Ryan and his ideological peers would slash everything from Social Security to Medicare and on through the list, and would hand out more tax breaks to the people at the top. Robin Hood would turn over in his grave.
We should not kid ourselves. It isn't certain that things will stay as good as they are now. The wealth and income of the top 1 percent grows at the expense of everyone else. Money breeds power and power breeds more money. It is a truly vicious circle.
A surefire politics of change would necessarily involve getting people in the middle -- from the 30th to the 70th percentile -- to see their own economic self-interest. If they vote in their own self-interest, they'll elect people who are likely to be more aligned with people with lower incomes as well as with them. As long as people in the middle identify more with people on the top than with those on the bottom, we are doomed. The obscene amount of money flowing into the electoral process makes things harder yet.
But history shows that people power wins sometimes. That's what happened in the Progressive Era a century ago and in the Great Depression as well. The gross inequality of those times produced an amalgam of popular unrest, organization, muckraking journalism and political leadership that attacked the big -- and worsening -- structural problem of economic inequality. The civil rights movement changed the course of history and spread into the women's movement, the environmental movement and, later, the gay rights movement. Could we have said on the day before the dawn of each that it would happen, let alone succeed? Did Rosa Parks know?
We have the ingredients. For one thing, the demographics of the electorate are changing. The consequences of that are hardly automatic, but they create an opportunity. The new generation of young people -- unusually distrustful of encrusted power in all institutions and, as a consequence, tending toward libertarianism -- is ripe for a new politics of honesty. Lower-income people will participate if there are candidates who speak to their situations. The change has to come from the bottom up and from synergistic leadership that draws it out. When people decide they have had enough and there are candidates who stand for what they want, they will vote accordingly.
I have seen days of promise and days of darkness, and I've seen them more than once. All history is like that. The people have the power if they will use it, but they have to see that it is in their interest to do so.

THE CANDIDATEWhat It Takes to Win -- and Hold -- the White House
By Samuel L. Popkin350 pp. Oxford University Press. $27.95.
To grasp the managerial challenges of a presidential campaign, consider the start-up company known as Romney Inc. The Romney firm introduced its featured product last year, concentrating on a handful of small but competitive markets like Iowa and New Hampshire. By this November, Romney Inc.'s gross revenue is projected to grow to at least three-quarters of a billion dollars; it will have opened new branch offices across the country and hired hundreds of new employees. And if Romney Inc. can't corner more than 50 percent of the market by then, it will go out of business.
In ''The Candidate,'' Samuel L. Popkin, a professor at the University of California, San Diego, and sometime campaign adviser, has attempted to write a kind of management bible for the business of presidential campaigning. Polling, strategy and even a candidate's platform, Popkin argues, are less important than organization: how a candidate parcels out authority, how his staff manages his time and attention, and whether his campaign can respond quickly to the chaos and shifting demands of the trail. 
All campaigns boil down to one of three kinds, Popkin writes. One is the ''challenger'' seeking to reclaim the White House for his party -- and perennially promising to ''end messy politics as we know it.'' (When Obama told voters in 2008 that ''this campaign cannot be about me,'' he was echoing Howard Dean, who had proclaimed four years earlier that ''this campaign is not really about me,'' and Jerry Brown, who had insisted the 1992 campaign was ''much larger than me.'') Another is the ''incumbent'' looking for a second term, someone who last campaigned as a challenger and now must persuade voters that a Washington insider is their best choice. The third is the ''successor,'' usually a vice president, who must distinguish himself from the president he serves without alienating the White House staff or party constituencies still loyal to the boss.
Like any management guru, Popkin comes bearing case studies. In 2007, Hillary Clinton was a challenger who mistakenly ran as a kind of incumbent. She campaigned ''as if she were a leader in exile,'' Popkin writes. She entrusted both polling and strategy to a single adviser, Mark Penn, who devised a ''shock and awe'' campaign based on inevitability: Clinton's endorsements, her fund-raising prowess, her experience in the Senate.
But as Obama gathered strength with a message of hope and change, flaws in Clinton's campaign organization made it difficult for her to shift gears. Penn defended inevitability, restricting access to his poll findings so that other aides couldn't second-guess him. Rampant infighting also made it difficult to alter strategy, since any changes -- like pouring more money and staff into the Iowa caucuses later won by Obama, or emphasizing her character, as some aides favored -- meant surrendering turf.
In 1991, George H. W. Bush was the incumbent who couldn't lose. After his years in the White House, with victory in Iraq and the end of the cold war under his belt, he considered the possible Democratic candidates self-evidently underqualified. He believed that voters would reward him for his credentials on national defense, which had been a Republican franchise over the preceding decade, and that he could pincer any opponent on social issues like welfare and crime.
But Bush suffered from a disconnect typical of incumbents: His White House staff balked at yielding turf to his campaign team. Bush's chief of staff, John Sununu, was arrogant and dismissive, a self-appointed ''deputy president.'' Politically tone-deaf, he believed voters would not punish Bush for breaking his ''read my lips'' pledge not to raise taxes, and he controlled access in order to enforce his own opinions, freezing out Bush's pollster and others when they disagreed. When the Democrats nominated Bill Clinton, a tough-on-crime ''New Democrat'' who tapped into Americans' economic anxieties, Bush and his team were slow to adapt.
Even harder, Popkin says, is the third type of candidacy: the successor. When Al Gore ran in 2000, the country had enjoyed years of peace and prosperity. But voters are skeptical of vice presidents who claim credit for a president's accomplishments, Popkin notes. And whereas Clinton had outfoxed Congressional Republicans by persuading voters they were extreme, Gore faced George W. Bush, who promised -- like all challengers -- an end to partisan rancor. ''If Gore couldn't get credit for peace and prosperity, and if Clinton was an albatross,'' Popkin writes, ''what could Gore say about the last eight years that made him the right change instead of Bush?''
Gore couldn't solve that puzzle, Popkin argues, in large part because he was pulled in different directions by his White House staff, his family and his campaign aides. Gore resented Bill Clinton for his infidelities and impeachment, empowering staff and family members who blamed ''Clinton fatigue'' for his lagging campaign. He overrelied on his adviser Naomi Wolf, a friend of his daughter's. He would make snap decisions without warning his strategists. Organizational chaos begat message confusion: ''You've never had it so good, and I'm mad as hell about it,'' as the columnist Michael Kinsley described the populist turn Gore took late in the race.
Popkin is the rare political scientist who believes that campaigns really do matter -- that election outcomes are not driven mostly by economic and demographic trends over which candidates have no control. His influential 1991 book, ''The Reasoning Voter,'' remains a go-to text for understanding what information voters use to pick candidates. But reading ''The Candidate,'' I found myself wondering about Popkin's choice of examples.
If infighting doomed Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, for example, how did Bill Clinton win in 1996 despite vicious feuding between his Republican-minded Svengali, Dick Morris, and more liberal advisers like Harold Ickes? Did John McCain lose against Obama because his campaign was improvisational and fractured, or because Obama outspent him by more than two to one? (I'll be curious to see Popkin's take on the 2012 election: one thing Obama and Romney have in common is methodical, well-organized campaign teams.)
Another problem is that ''The Candidate,'' like candidates themselves, often veers off message. Popkin is a political buff, and his book comes so overloaded with anecdotes and ephemera that it's hard to follow. Even when the material is interesting -- like the description of how Obama aides in South Carolina handed out old-fashioned campaign buttons with Obama's picture on them, so primary voters would know he was black -- it is distracting. And at times, Popkin needlessly belabors the basics of campaigning. ''The candidate has to persuade skeptical voters that she is 'one of us,''' he writes in one chapter, ''that she understands their lives and shares their values.''
While Popkin has deserved fun with the short attention spans and hyperbole endemic to political reporting, ''The Candidate'' actually has much in common with behind-the-scenes campaign books like ''Game Change,'' John Heilemann and Mark Halperin's racy and addictive account of the 2008 race. Both are basically about the perils of infighting. Popkin's solutions, offered at the end of ''The Candidate,'' may seem obvious to political executives. Don't candidates know to hire a strong chief of staff who can be an honest broker, to keep a peer around who can tell them when they're wrong, to assign a senior staff member to keep their family in the loop? Popkin's book suggests an unexpected answer: If it were easy, everyone would do it.

HEADLINE: Romney to Back Israel's Right to Strike Iran, Aide Says

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: In a speech on Sunday, Mitt Romney plans to assert that he respects Israel's right to take pre-emptive action against Iran to prevent the country from developing nuclear capabilities that could be used for a bomb. 

 BODY:
JERUSALEM - In a speech here Sunday evening, Mitt Romney plans to assert that he respects Israel's right to take pre-emptive action to stop Iran from developing nuclear capabilities that could be used for a weapon.
Dan Senor, a senior Romney foreign policy adviser who helped orchestrate Mr. Romney's visit here, told reporters in a briefing before the speech that Mr. Romney would express - several times - that it was "unacceptable" for Iran to develop the capability to build nuclear weapons and his view that Israel does have the right to take action against Iran.
"If Israel has to take action on its own, in order to stop Iran from developing that capability, the governor would respect that decision," Mr. Senor said.
Previewing Mr. Romney's remarks, Mr. Senor explained: "It is not enough just to stop Iran from developing a nuclear program. The capability, even if that capability is short of weaponization, is a pathway to weaponization, and the capability gives Iran the power it needs to wreak havoc in the region and around the world."
A short time later, the Romney campaign issued a statement that seemed to slightly soften its statement. 
"Governor Romney believes we should employ any and all measures to dissuade the Iranian regime from its nuclear course, and it is his fervent hope that diplomatic and economic measures will do so," Mr. Senor said in an e-mail statement released by the campaign. "In the final analysis, of course, no option should be excluded. Governor Romney recognizes Israel's right to defend itself, and that it is right for America to stand with it."
In an interview on CBS' "Face the Nation," Mr. Romney said: "I'll use my own words and that is I respect the right of Israel to defend itself and we stand with Israel."
"We're two nations that come together in peace and that want to see Iran being dissuaded from its nuclear folly," he said.
"Because I'm on foreign soil," Mr. Romney said, "I don't want to be creating new foreign policy for my country or in any way to distance myself from the foreign policy of our nation, but we respect the right of a nation to defend itself."
While Mr. Romney's rival, President Obama, has not ruled out military action, he has urged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel to first give diplomacy and economic sanctions a chance to work. And he has warned about the consequences of an Israeli strike on Iran.
Mr. Romney and Mr. Netanyahu met Sunday morning for a working meeting, and the topic turned quickly to Iran.
"I have to say that I heard some of your remarks a few days ago - you said that the greatest danger facing the world is of the Ayatollah regime possessing nuclear weapons capability," Mr. Netanyahu said. "Mitt, I couldn't agree with you more, and I think it's important to do everything in our power to prevent the Ayatollahs from possessing the capability. We have to be honest and say that all the sanctions and diplomacy so far have not set back the Iranian program by one iota."
He added: "And that's why I believe that we need a strong and credible military threat, coupled with the sanctions, to have a chance to change that situation."
Mr. Romney, after acknowledging "a friendship which spans the years" - dating back to their days as young consultants in Boston - also discussed Iran.
"Your perspectives with regards to Iran and its effort to become a nuclear-capable nation are ones which I take with great seriousness and look forward to chatting with you about further actions that we can take to dissuade Iran from their nuclear folly," Mr. Romney said.
At the annual Herzliya Conference in 2007, Mr. Romney took a strong stance against Iran, arguing that the country's nuclear capabilities must, can, and will be stopped. But the message coming out of Mr. Romney's campaign in advance of his speech represents a ratcheting up of his previous position.
In excerpts released by his campaign, Mr. Romney plans to stress the importance of protecting Israel's right to defend itself against Iran.
"But today, the regime in Iran is five years closer to developing nuclear weapons capability," Mr. Romney's prepared remarks say. "Preventing that outcome must be our highest national security priority."
For Mr. Romney, the trip to Israel is a crucial opportunity to show his statesmanship, especially after a less-than-perfect London trip, and to highlight his relationship with Mr. Netanyahu.' But the perils include appearing critical of a sitting president from foreign soil. For Mr. Netanyahu, a right-leaning leader whose relationship with President Obama has been rocky at best, the visit is a chance to ratchet up the pressure on the administration over the Iranian nuclear threat, but he must be careful not to be seen as partisan or meddling.
Mr. Romney also met Sunday with Israel's president, Shimon Peres, and the leader of the opposition in Parliament, Shaul Mofaz. But his campaign canceled a scheduled session with leaders of the Labor Party about an hour before it was supposed to happen.
Isaac Herzog, head of Parliament's Labor faction, said that Mr. Senor had first reached out to him about a month ago, and that the campaign followed with an official request in mid-July. Labor's chief, Shellye Yacimovich, was replaced as head of the opposition two weeks ago when Mr. Mofaz and Kadima left Mr. Netanyahu's unity government, but the Romney campaign kept the Labor meeting anyhow, Mr. Herzog said, calling on Friday and again Sunday to confirm details.
Then, the campaign switched gears.
"He said they have a timetable problem," Mr. Herzog said of Mr. Senor. "But one can find the time if one wants to find the time."

HEADLINE: 'The Dark Knight Rises' Leads at a Sluggish Box Office

BYLINE: BROOKS BARNES


HIGHLIGHT: North American theaters sold about $135 million in tickets over the weekend, a 25 percent decline from the same period last year, according to studio distribution executives. 

 BODY:
Going into the weekend, the research firm NRG told film studios that about 20 percent of moviegoers remained hesitant to go to the movies following the July 20 mass shooting in Colorado during "The Dark Knight Rises." Studios also worried about competition from the London Olympics and poor weather in parts of the country.
Something sure dragged down box office results: North American theaters sold about $135 million in tickets over the weekend, a 25 percent decline from the same period last year, according to studio distribution executives. "The Dark Knight Rises" (Warner Brothers) was No. 1, taking in an estimated $64 million -- a 60 percent drop from last weekend, when the movie benefited from strong advance ticket sales. "The Dark Knight Rises" has now taken in about $289.1 million in the United States and Canada, or 14 percent less than its franchise predecessor grossed over the same period in 2008, after adjusting for inflation.
"Ice Age: Continental Drift" (20th Century Fox) was second for the weekend, selling about $13.3 million in tickets, for a three-week total of $114.8 million, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box-office data. "The Watch," a Fox ensemble comedy, was third, taking in about $13 million. "The Watch," which cost $68 million to make, experienced publicity setbacks after the February shooting of a Florida teenager by a community watch participant. "Step Up Revolution" (Lionsgate) was fourth, taking in an estimated $11.8 million -- the lowest opening-weekend gross in the history of this four-film series; "Revolution" cost about $33 million to make. "Ted" (Universal) managed $7.4 million in ticket sales, enough for fifth place and a five-week total of about $193.6 million.

HEADLINE: The Morality of Migration

BYLINE: SEYLA BENHABIB


HIGHLIGHT: Immigration pits two moral and legal principles, foundational to the modern state system, against each other. How can they be reconciled? 

 BODY:
In announcing the Department of Homeland Security's policy directive on June 15 stating that undocumented migrant youths who meet certain conditions would no longer be deported, President Obama said that "It was the right thing to do." What he did not say was whether he meant "the right thing" legally or morally.
Obviously, he considered the action to be legal, even though this invocation of his administration's power drew strong criticism from many, including Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. But the president's grounds for believing it moral were much less clear.
This should come as no surprise: the morality and politics of migration are among the most divisive issues in much of the world. In the United States, discussions of immigration flow seamlessly into matters of national security, employment levels, the health of the American economy, and threats to a presumptive American national identity and way of life. Much the same is true in Europe. Not a week goes by without a story of refugees from Africa or Asia perishing while trying to arrive at the shores of the European Union.
Nor are such developments restricted to the resource-rich countries of the Northern Hemisphere. The United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Singapore, Israel and Jordan are countries with the of migrants among their total population, while the United States, the Russian Federation, Germany, Saudi Arabia, Canada and France lead in the of international migrants. Migrations are now global, challenging many societies in many parts of the world.

Whereas from 1910 to 2012, the world's population increased slightly more than fourfold, from 1.6 billion to to more than 7 billion, the number of people living in countries other than their own as migrants increased nearly sevenfold, from roughly 33 million to more than 200 million.
Migrations pit two moral and legal principles, foundational to the modern state system, against each other. On one hand, the human right of individuals to move across borders whether for economic, personal or professional reasons or to seek asylum and refuge is guaranteed by Articles 13 and 14 of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. On the other hand, Article 21 of the declaration recognizes a basic right to self-government, stipulating that "the will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government." Under the current regime of states, that fundamental right includes control over borders as well as determining is to be a citizen as distinguished from a resident or an alien.
The international system straddles these dual principles but it has not been able to reconcile them. The irony of global developments is that while state sovereignty in economic, military, and technological domains is eroded and national borders have become more porous, they are still policed to keep out aliens and intruders. The migrant's body has become the symbolic site upon which such contradictions are enacted.
Why not advocate a "world without borders" then? From a moral point of view, no child to be born on one side of the border rather than another, and it is deeply antithetical to our moral principles to punish individuals for what they cannot help being or doing. Punishment implies responsibility and accountability for one's actions and choices; clearly, children who through their parents' choices end up on one side of the border rather than another cannot be penalized for these choices.
A strong advocate of the right to self-government might retort that rewarding certain children for the wrongs committed by their parents, in this case illegal immigration, by legalizing undocumented youths is illogical as well as immoral and that "the right thing to do" would be to deport undocumented migrants - parents and children alike. Apart from the sheer impracticality of this solution, its advocates seem to consider undocumented "original entry" into a country as the analog of "original sin" that no amount of subsequent behavior and atonement can alter.
But such punitive rigor unfairly conflates the messy and often inadvertent reasons that lead one to become an undocumented migrant with no criminal intent to break the law.
If conditions in a person's native country so endanger his life and well-being and he becomes willing to risk illegality in order to survive, his right to survival, from a moral point of view, carries as much weight as does the new country's claim to control borders against migrants. Immanuel Kant, therefore, called the moral claim to seek refuge or respite in the lands of another, a "universal right of hospitality," provided that the intentions of the foreigner upon arriving on foreign lands were peaceful. Such a right, he argued, belonged to each human being placed on this planet who had to share the earth with others.
Even though morally the right to hospitality is an individual right, the socioeconomic and cultural causes of migrations are for the most part collective. Migrations occur because of economic, environmental, cultural and historical "push" and "pull" factors. "We are here," say migrants, "because in effect you were there." "We did not cross the border; the border crossed us."
We do have special obligations to our neighbors, as opposed to moral obligations to humanity at large, if, for example, our economy has devastated theirs; if our industrial output has led to environmental harm or if our drug dependency has encouraged the formation of transnational drug cartels.
These claims of interdependence require a third moral principle - in addition to the right of universal hospitality and the right to self-government - to be brought into consideration: among peoples arising through historical factors.
States cannot ignore such associative obligations. Migration policies, though they are often couched in nation-centric terms, always have transnational causes and consequences. It is impossible to address Mexican migration into the United States, for example, without considering the decades-long dependency of the rich California agricultural fields upon the often undocumented and unorganized labor of Mexican workers, some of whose children have now grown up to become "Dreamers" (so named after the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act introduced to Congress in 2001). Among the three million students who graduate from United States high schools, 65,000 are undocumented.
The United States owes these young people a special duty of hospitality, not only because we, as a society, have benefited from the circumstances under which their parents entered this country, but also because they have formed strong affiliations with this society through being our friends, students, neighbors and coworkers. In a liberal-democratic society the path to citizenship must follow along these associative ties through which an individual shows him or herself to be capable and worthy of citizenship.
Migratory movements are sites of imperfect justice in that they bring into play the individual right to freedom of movement, the universal right to hospitality and the right of collectives to self-government as well as specific associative moral obligations. These rights cannot always be easily reconciled. Furthermore, international law does not as yet recognize a "human right to citizenship" for migrants, and considers this a sovereign prerogative of individual states. Nonetheless, the responsible politician is the one who acts with a lucid understanding of the necessity to balance these principles rather than giving in to a punitive rigorism that would deny, in Thomas Jefferson's words, "the right which nature has given to all men of departing from [and I would add, from joining with] the country in which choice, not chance has placed them" (1774).
Whether or not President Obama considered all these moral aspects of the matter, his handling of this issue shows that he acted as a "responsible politician," and not opportunistically as some of his critics charged. It was "the right thing to do."
An earlier version of this article incorrectly referred to the action announced by President Obama on June 15. It was a policy directive issued by the Department of Homeland Security, not an executive order.

HEADLINE: For More Pianos, Last Note Is Thud in the Dump

BYLINE: By DANIEL J. WAKIN

 BODY:
SOUTHAMPTON, Pa. -- The Knabe baby grand did a cartwheel and landed on its back, legs poking into the air. A Lester upright thudded onto its side with a final groan of strings, a death-rattling chord. After 10 pianos were dumped, a small yellow loader with a claw in front scuttled in like a vicious beetle, crushing keyboards, soundboards and cases into a pile.
The site, a trash-transfer station in this town 20 miles north of Philadelphia, is just one place where pianos go to die. This kind of scene has become increasingly common.
The value of used pianos, especially uprights, has plummeted in recent years. So instead of selling them to a neighbor, donating them to a church or just passing them along to a relative, owners are far more likely to discard them, technicians, movers and dealers say. Piano movers are making regular runs to the dump, becoming adept at dismantling instruments, selling parts to artists, even burning them for firewood. 
''We bust them up with a sledgehammer,'' said Jeffrey Harrington, the owner of Harrington Moving & Storage in Maplewood, N.J.
Pianos consist of hundreds of pounds of metal, wood and intricate machinery able to channel Bach, Mozart and Beethoven, along with honky-tonk, ''Happy Birthday'' and holiday tunes. It is strange to think of them as disposable as tissues. Yet economic and cultural forces have made many used pianos, with the exception of Steinways and a few other high-end brands, prone to being jettisoned.
With thousands of moving parts, pianos are expensive to repair, requiring long hours of labor by skilled technicians whose numbers are diminishing. Excellent digital pianos and portable keyboards can cost as little as several hundred dollars. Low-end imported pianos have improved remarkably in quality and can be had for under $3,000.
''Instead of spending hundreds or thousands to repair an old piano, you can buy a new one made in China that's just as good, or you can buy a digital one that doesn't need tuning and has all kinds of bells and whistles,'' said Larry Fine, the editor and publisher of Acoustic & Digital Piano Buyer, the industry bible.
Used pianos abound on Web sites like eBay, driving prices down and making it difficult to sell Grandma's old upright. With moving costs of several hundred dollars, even giving a piano away can be expensive. Abandonment often becomes the only option, especially for heirs dealing with a relative's property.
Many pianos are also dying of old age. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, before radio and recordings, pianos were the main source of music, even entertainment, in the home. They were a middle-class must-have.
So from 1900 to 1930, the golden age of piano making, American factories churned out millions of them. Nearly 365,000 were sold at the peak, in 1910, according to the National Piano Manufacturers Association. (In 2011, 41,000 were sold, along with 120,000 digital pianos and 1.1 million keyboards, according to Music Trades magazine.)
The average life span rarely exceeds 80 years, piano technicians say. That's a lot of pianos now reaching the end of the line.
Piano dealers also blame other changes in society for a lack of demand in the used-piano market: cuts in music education in schools, competition for practice time from other pursuits, a drop in spending on home furnishings with the fall of the housing market.
Whatever the reason, people in the piano world agree that disposals are mounting.
O'Mara Meehan Piano Movers said it takes 5 to 10 pianos a month to the debris transfer site here. The company was founded in 1874 by the great-grandfather of the brothers Bryan and Charles T. O'Mara Jr.
Bryan O'Mara and an employee, James A. Fox, drove their truck into a hangarlike structure one day last week. Inside the truck were six uprights and four grands. Several came from the Philadelphia school system and one from a retirement home. ''This was Mrs. Dombrowski's from New Hope,'' Mr. O'Mara said, patting the Knabe.
Mr. O'Mara and Mr. Fox pushed them off the back of the truck one by one. The top of an upright popped off when it landed. Mr. Fox tossed amputated piano legs and a pedal mechanism. Sprayers from above sent out a swirl of dust-settling mist, adding to the surreal atmosphere.
Mr. O'Mara had charged the former owners about $150 per piano. The trash site charged him $233.24 for dumping them all. A recycling company would pick up the debris and separate the wood from the metal.
Beethoven Pianos, a restorer, renter, mover and dealer in New York, has a 34,000-square-foot warehouse at the base of the Third Avenue Bridge in the Bronx, with scores of pianos awaiting disposal, said the owner, Carl Demler.
''In wintertime we burn them,'' he said, pointing to a round metal stove. ''This one has eaten many pianos.''
He watched as a worker, James Williams, dismantled a grand. ''Ashes to ashes,'' Mr. Demler said.
''Dust to dust,'' Mr. Williams added, unscrewing pins that held the strings.
The junking of the modern descendant of the ''gravicembalo col piano e forte,'' the Italian precursor, can evoke strong reactions. A video posted on YouTube by one mover showing pianos being dumped drew violent remarks. Commenters said they felt sickened and called the scene barbaric, painful, outrageous, even criminal. ''Stop the horror!'' one wrote.
When the video was described to Madeleine Crouch, the administrator of the National Piano Manufacturers Association, she responded with a sharp intake of breath. ''That makes me cry,'' she said. ''Pianos are lovable. You wouldn't want your pet horse to be thrown out into the glue factory.''
Such reactions emphasize the abyss between the emotional value of used pianos and their worth in the marketplace.
''It is the most emotionally charged piece of furniture that there is,'' said Martha Taylor, a rare restorer of uprights, whose Immortal Piano Company is based in Portland, Ore. ''When I have to say: 'You've buried your grandmother. You have to bury her piano,' it's a really hard thing.''
Many movers say they strive to find homes for abandoned pianos, making the rounds of nursing homes, schools and other institutions.
''You hate to see them go,'' said Mr. O'Mara, whose company tries to give away discarded pianos. Any rescued piano, he noted, is also a potential future move for O'Mara Meehan. But there is just so much room in his warehouse for adoptees. He has to cull them like a herd. Churches and schools often do not have room or the means to maintain them.
Brian Goodwin, who owns Piano Movers of Nashua, N.H., and who had 30 pianos in his warehouse ready for the dump recently, said he created the Web site Piano Adoption partly as a clearing house to find homes for unwanted pianos. He posted the video of the dumped pianos that drew such shocked responses.
When owners ask where a cherished piano is going, he said, he tries to avoid the subject or tells them it will be put up for adoption.
''The last thing they want to hear is that it's going to a landfill,'' he said.
But piano movers can also take a clinical view of piano disposal, since they understand the economic realities. While noting that piano disposals can be painful, Mr. Goodwin said: ''To be honest with you, the guys enjoy it. They try so hard all day not to scratch anything. And all of a sudden they get to throw it off the back of a truck.''

HEADLINE: The Conversion of a Climate-Change Skeptic

BYLINE: By RICHARD A. MULLER. 
Richard A. Muller, a professor of physics at the University of California, Berkeley, and a former MacArthur Foundation fellow, is the author, most recently, of ''Energy for Future Presidents: The Science Behind the Headlines.''

 BODY:
Berkeley, Calif.
CALL me a converted skeptic. Three years ago I identified problems in previous climate studies that, in my mind, threw doubt on the very existence of global warming. Last year, following an intensive research effort involving a dozen scientists, I concluded that global warming was real and that the prior estimates of the rate of warming were correct. I'm now going a step further: Humans are almost entirely the cause.
My total turnaround, in such a short time, is the result of careful and objective analysis by the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature project, which I founded with my daughter Elizabeth. Our results show that the average temperature of the earth's land has risen by two and a half degrees Fahrenheit over the past 250 years, including an increase of one and a half degrees over the most recent 50 years. Moreover, it appears likely that essentially all of this increase results from the human emission of greenhouse gases. 
These findings are stronger than those of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the United Nations group that defines the scientific and diplomatic consensus on global warming. In its 2007 report, the I.P.C.C. concluded only that most of the warming of the prior 50 years could be attributed to humans. It was possible, according to the I.P.C.C. consensus statement, that the warming before 1956 could be because of changes in solar activity, and that even a substantial part of the more recent warming could be natural.
Our Berkeley Earth approach used sophisticated statistical methods developed largely by our lead scientist, Robert Rohde, which allowed us to determine earth land temperature much further back in time. We carefully studied issues raised by skeptics: biases from urban heating (we duplicated our results using rural data alone), from data selection (prior groups selected fewer than 20 percent of the available temperature stations; we used virtually 100 percent), from poor station quality (we separately analyzed good stations and poor ones) and from human intervention and data adjustment (our work is completely automated and hands-off). In our papers we demonstrate that none of these potentially troublesome effects unduly biased our conclusions.
The historic temperature pattern we observed has abrupt dips that match the emissions of known explosive volcanic eruptions; the particulates from such events reflect sunlight, make for beautiful sunsets and cool the earth's surface for a few years. There are small, rapid variations attributable to El Nino and other ocean currents such as the Gulf Stream; because of such oscillations, the ''flattening'' of the recent temperature rise that some people claim is not, in our view, statistically significant. What has caused the gradual but systematic rise of two and a half degrees? We tried fitting the shape to simple math functions (exponentials, polynomials), to solar activity and even to rising functions like world population. By far the best match was to the record of atmospheric carbon dioxide, measured from atmospheric samples and air trapped in polar ice.
Just as important, our record is long enough that we could search for the fingerprint of solar variability, based on the historical record of sunspots. That fingerprint is absent. Although the I.P.C.C. allowed for the possibility that variations in sunlight could have ended the ''Little Ice Age,'' a period of cooling from the 14th century to about 1850, our data argues strongly that the temperature rise of the past 250 years cannot be attributed to solar changes. This conclusion is, in retrospect, not too surprising; we've learned from satellite measurements that solar activity changes the brightness of the sun very little.
How definite is the attribution to humans? The carbon dioxide curve gives a better match than anything else we've tried. Its magnitude is consistent with the calculated greenhouse effect -- extra warming from trapped heat radiation. These facts don't prove causality and they shouldn't end skepticism, but they raise the bar: to be considered seriously, an alternative explanation must match the data at least as well as carbon dioxide does. Adding methane, a second greenhouse gas, to our analysis doesn't change the results. Moreover, our analysis does not depend on large, complex global climate models, the huge computer programs that are notorious for their hidden assumptions and adjustable parameters. Our result is based simply on the close agreement between the shape of the observed temperature rise and the known greenhouse gas increase.
It's a scientist's duty to be properly skeptical. I still find that much, if not most, of what is attributed to climate change is speculative, exaggerated or just plain wrong. I've analyzed some of the most alarmist claims, and my skepticism about them hasn't changed.
Hurricane Katrina cannot be attributed to global warming. The number of hurricanes hitting the United States has been going down, not up; likewise for intense tornadoes. Polar bears aren't dying from receding ice, and the Himalayan glaciers aren't going to melt by 2035. And it's possible that we are currently no warmer than we were a thousand years ago, during the ''Medieval Warm Period'' or ''Medieval Optimum,'' an interval of warm conditions known from historical records and indirect evidence like tree rings. And the recent warm spell in the United States happens to be more than offset by cooling elsewhere in the world, so its link to ''global'' warming is weaker than tenuous.
The careful analysis by our team is laid out in five scientific papers now online at BerkeleyEarth.org. That site also shows our chart of temperature from 1753 to the present, with its clear fingerprint of volcanoes and carbon dioxide, but containing no component that matches solar activity. Four of our papers have undergone extensive scrutiny by the scientific community, and the newest, a paper with the analysis of the human component, is now posted, along with the data and computer programs used. Such transparency is the heart of the scientific method; if you find our conclusions implausible, tell us of any errors of data or analysis.
What about the future? As carbon dioxide emissions increase, the temperature should continue to rise. I expect the rate of warming to proceed at a steady pace, about one and a half degrees over land in the next 50 years, less if the oceans are included. But if China continues its rapid economic growth (it has averaged 10 percent per year over the last 20 years) and its vast use of coal (it typically adds one new gigawatt per month), then that same warming could take place in less than 20 years.
Science is that narrow realm of knowledge that, in principle, is universally accepted. I embarked on this analysis to answer questions that, to my mind, had not been answered. I hope that the Berkeley Earth analysis will help settle the scientific debate regarding global warming and its human causes. Then comes the difficult part: agreeing across the political and diplomatic spectrum about what can and should be done.

HEADLINE: Crash Of the Bumblebee

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Last week Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, declared that his institution ''is ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro'' -- and markets celebrated. In particular, interest rates on Spanish bonds fell sharply, and stock markets soared everywhere.
But will the euro really be saved? That remains very much in doubt. 
First of all, Europe's single currency is a deeply flawed construction. And Mr. Draghi, to his credit, actually acknowledged that. ''The euro is like a bumblebee,'' he declared. ''This is a mystery of nature because it shouldn't fly but instead it does. So the euro was a bumblebee that flew very well for several years.'' But now it has stopped flying. What can be done? The answer, he suggested, is ''to graduate to a real bee.''
Never mind the dubious biology, we get the point. In the long run, the euro will be workable only if the European Union becomes much more like a unified country.
Consider, for example, the comparison between Spain and Florida. Both had huge housing bubbles followed by dramatic crashes. But Spain is in crisis in a way Florida isn't. Why? Because when the slump hit, Florida could count on Washington to keep paying for Social Security and Medicare, to guarantee the solvency of its banks, to provide emergency aid to its unemployed, and more. Spain had no such safety net, and in the long run, that has to be fixed.
But the creation of a United States of Europe won't happen soon, if ever, while the crisis of the euro is now. So what can be done to save the currency?
Well, why was the bumblebee able to fly for a while? Why did the euro seem to work for its first eight or so years? Because the structure's flaws were papered over by a boom in southern Europe. The creation of the euro convinced investors that it was safe to lend to countries like Greece and Spain that had previously been considered risky, so money poured into these countries -- mainly, by the way, to finance private rather than public borrowing, with Greece the exception.
And for a while everyone was happy. In southern Europe, huge housing bubbles led to a surge in construction employment, even as manufacturing became increasingly uncompetitive. Meanwhile, the German economy, which had been languishing, perked up thanks to rapidly rising exports to those bubble economies in the south. The euro, it seemed, was working.
Then the bubbles burst. The construction jobs vanished, and unemployment in the south soared; it's now well above 20 percent in both Spain and Greece. At the same time, revenues plunged; for the most part, big budget deficits are a result, not a cause, of the crisis. Nonetheless, investors took flight, driving up borrowing costs. In an attempt to soothe the financial markets, the afflicted countries imposed harsh austerity measures that deepened their slumps. And the euro as a whole is looking dangerously shaky.
What could turn this dangerous situation around? The answer is fairly clear: policy makers would have to (a) do something to bring southern Europe's borrowing costs down and (b) give Europe's debtors the same kind of opportunity to export their way out of trouble that Germany received during the good years -- that is, create a boom in Germany that mirrors the boom in southern Europe between 1999 and 2007. (And yes, that would mean a temporary rise in German inflation.) The trouble is that Europe's policy makers seem reluctant to do (a) and completely unwilling to do (b).
In his remarks, Mr. Draghi -- who I suspect understands all of this -- basically floated the idea of having the central bank buy lots of southern European bonds to bring those borrowing costs down. But over the next two days German officials appeared to throw cold water on that idea. In principle, Mr. Draghi could just overrule German objections, but would he really be willing to do that?
And bond purchases are the easy part. The euro can't be saved unless Germany is also willing to accept substantially higher inflation over the next few years -- and so far I have seen no sign that German officials are even willing to discuss this issue, let alone accept what's necessary. Instead, they're still insisting, despite failure after failure -- remember when Ireland was supposedly on the road to rapid recovery? -- that everything will be fine if debtors just stick to their austerity programs.
So could the euro be saved? Yes, probably. Should it be saved? Yes, even though its creation now looks like a huge mistake. For failure of the euro wouldn't just cause economic disruption; it would be a giant blow to the wider European project, which has brought peace and democracy to a continent with a tragic history.
But will it actually be saved? Despite Mr. Draghi's show of determination, that is, as I said, very much in doubt.

HEADLINE: West Bank's Emerging Silicon Valley Evades Issues of Borders

BYLINE: By ISABEL KERSHNER

 BODY:
RAMALLAH, West Bank -- The spotless cafeteria is fashionably furnished with fluorescent orange and lime green tables, and there are table tennis and foosball tables in the basement. What else could it be but a tech start-up, even here?
The idea, of course, is to give employees something resembling the comfortable, innovation-friendly working conditions that are a hallmark of Silicon Valleys around the world, said Murad Tahboub, 42, the managing director of ASAL Technologies. Because that is what Ramallah, the West Bank city where the Palestinian Authority has its administrative headquarters, has ambitions to become: a hub for the information and communications technology industry.
With 120 employees, ASAL is one of the largest companies in the small but burgeoning Palestinian tech sector, which many of those involved say is on the verge of big things. ''We are in the right position to have exponential growth,'' said Mr. Tahboub, looking every bit the part with his slicked-back hair and black-rimmed Lacoste eyeglasses.
Compared with other industries that the anemic West Bank economy might look to develop, the information and communications technology sector has an advantage: it is much less affected by impediments to movement, like the barriers, checkpoints and permit requirements that Israel imposes on the territory in the name of security. 
''This is a sector that has no borders,'' Mr. Tahboub observed. ''You just need electricity and a telephone line.''
In the four years since Cisco Systems made an initial strategic investment of about $10 million here, financing the beginnings of business-service outsourcing to Palestinian companies, supporting training programs and drawing in other international partners, the sector is said to have grown from less than 1 percent of the Palestinian economy to more than 5 percent today -- albeit of an economy whose total output is estimated at a modest $5 billion to $6 billion.
For all the enthusiasm and talk of an emerging ''ecosystem'' from Palestinians newly proficient in the industry's international argot, the technologists of Ramallah must still grapple with some of the challenges that confront the wider Palestinian economy and society, most notably the continued absence of the long-envisaged Palestinian state.
A World Bank report issued last week said that while the Palestinian Authority had made steady progress toward building the institutions required by a future state, the economy was currently not strong enough to support such a state, and remained too dependent on foreign aid. The report said it was critical for the Palestinian Authority to increase trade, spur private-sector growth and integrate the territory into the world economy as much as possible.
Experts and business leaders say that the main resource the Palestinians have to work with is their young, well-educated, entrepreneurial-minded population. But there is a need, they say, to overcome the image the world has of the territory as a volatile conflict zone where people ride to work on camels.
Though outsourcing contracts are the mainstay of the industry here, the model that the Palestinian infotech sector looks to is not India's, with its immense population, but more that of Israel. ''Innovation, creativity, being ahead of the curve'' is the goal, said Tareq Maayah, 45, the chief executive of Exalt Technologies, ''rather than relying on a huge quantity of basic skills.''
Like Israel, the Palestinians want a resilient tech sector that can be a politics-free zone. ''The occupation is frustrating,'' Mr. Maayah observed, ''but Israelis and Palestinians have been working with each other in the worst of times.''
He said that Exalt handles outsourcing contracts from multinational companies operating in Israel and from some local companies as well. ''Now we are producers and we sell to Israel, as opposed to just being consumers,'' Mr. Maayah said. ''It's the start of a better balance in the economic relationship.''
Others noted that Israel has built a thriving technology sector even as it fought several wars in recent years.
There is no shortage of prospective employees; rather the opposite. About 2,000 Palestinians graduate from local universities each year in technical subjects, one-third to one-half of them women, but only about 30 percent of them find work in the local industry.
The Palestinian I.T. Association of Companies lists 125 members, about three-quarters of them based in the West Bank and the rest in Gaza, which is run by the militant group Hamas, not the Fatah-led Palestinian Authority. The entrepreneurs acknowledge that the industry is still in its infancy, with one estimating total outsourcing revenue at just $6 million a year. But they say it can be an attractive option for Israel-based firms because of its proximity, cultural familiarity, the talent of Palestinian engineers and their loyalty to their companies.
Sam Husseini runs LionHeart, a company that operates a training program with an Israeli partner to teach Palestinian entrepreneurs marketing skills. Two chief executives -- Husni Abu Samrah of MobiStine, a start-up that designs health care applications in Arabic, and Saeed Zeidan of Ultimit, which develops software and does consulting work -- each said they learned a lot from the training program, especially about what the industry still needs to thrive.
''The main thing is exposure,'' Mr. Zeidan said. ''We do not have exposure for the international market.''
Even so, Yahya al-Salqan, chief executive of Jaffa.Net, a software developer, said the regional market offered great promise. He observed that the Palestinian tech sector was uniquely placed in a ''sandwich'' between Israel's so-called Silicon Wadi, less than an hour's drive away on the Mediterranean coast, and what he called a huge emerging demand for technology services in Arab countries.
Mr. Salqan worked in Silicon Valley in California early in his career, and then returned home about 15 years ago to found Jaffa.Net, with one branch in Ramallah and another in Nablus in the northern West Bank. Jaffa.Net is working on mobile banking applications, and it will soon open an office in the Persian Gulf emirate of Qatar.
Many people here viewed Cisco's arrival in 2008 as a turning point for the industry. It started by offering a year's research and development financing to companies in Ramallah, and then began hiring Palestinian engineers on regular outsourcing contracts. More recently, it invested $5 million in Sadara Ventures, said to be the first venture capital fund focusing on the Palestinian territories.
Holding face-to-face meetings with Israel-based customers and investors is not always easy, despite the short distances. Mr. Husseini of LionHeart said his company had held meetings at Biankini Beach on the Dead Sea, south of Jericho, not because of the resort setting but because it was accessible to people from either side of the Israeli security cordon.
Zika Abzuk, Cisco's senior manager for corporate affairs in Israel, related one instance when she and a team of Israeli employees was stuck on one side of a closed military checkpoint near Jericho while 16 Palestinian entrepreneurs they had hoped to confer with were stuck on the other. In the end, they held their meeting on neutral ground: a Bedouin-style reception tent at a gas station near the checkpoint.

HEADLINE: A Big Banker's Belated Apology

BYLINE: By JEFF MADRICK. 
Jeff Madrick, a senior fellow at the Roosevelt Institute and the editor of Challenge magazine, is the author of ''Age of Greed: The Triumph of Finance and the Decline of America, 1970 to the Present.''

 BODY:
Last week, in a CNBC interview, Sanford I. Weill, the former chairman of Citigroup, said that America should separate investment banking from commercial banking. This separation, of course, was the prime purpose of the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, a piece of legislation that Mr. Weill and other bankers had successfully watered down, with Alan Greenspan's support, before Mr. Weill helped engineer its official demise in 1999. Now, Mr. Weill, the creator of what was once the largest financial conglomerate in the world, suggests that Citigroup and others should be broken up. Banks can no longer ''be too big to fail,'' he told CNBC.
But what was most eye-catching was Mr. Weill's claim that the conglomerate model ''was right for that time.'' Nothing could be further from the truth. 
Mr. Weill's original business concept -- the justification of financial conglomeration -- was to provide one-stop shopping to any and all customers. This could now include clients for investment banking, stock research, brokerage and insurance. Then, with the 1998 merger of his Travelers Group with Citicorp, it could include savers, business borrowers and credit card users, too. But few, even among his own executives, ever believed the strategy would work.
Rather, conglomeration bred conflicts of interest in Mr. Weill's firms, and others -- the very conflicts that the original Glass-Steagall Act was designed to prevent. This inevitably led to investment in and promotion of risky, poorly run and, in some cases, deceitful companies that brought us the high-technology and telecommunications bubble of the late 1990s.
Indeed, Mr. Weill's Citigroup was a primary underwriter of and one of the two largest lenders to the oil and futures trading firm Enron, whose accounting charade resulted in what was in 2001 the biggest bankruptcy of its time. Citigroup was a major underwriter for the telecommunications giants Global Crossing and WorldCom, which would later go bankrupt as a result of flagrant accounting deceptions. There were many other, if less visible, debacles.
At the heart of these fiascoes was the distortion of investment analysis into a sales pitch. Citigroup not only lent to Enron, WorldCom and Global Crossing and raised money for them, its analysts also aggressively promoted these companies to individual investors and pension funds. This was the bread and butter of Mr. Weill's ''cross-selling'' approach.
Traditionally, investment analysis on Wall Street had been fairly well trusted as an independent opinion on which investors could rely. But there was a shift during the speculative boom of the 1990s, when analysts were directly compensated by their firms for promoting the sale of shares and the purchase of bonds for investment banking and loan clients.
This happened across Wall Street, not just at Citigroup. As one well-known analyst, Ronald Glantz, told Congress in 2001, ''Now the job of analysts is to bring in investment banking clients, not provide good investment advice.'' In the late 1990s, according to the former Harvard Business School professor D. Quinn Mills, only 1 percent of analysts' recommendations were to sell a stock.
Jack Grubman, Mr. Weill's star telecommunications analyst, became the poster child for promotional investment advice, earning up to $20 million a year. His most glaring error was to keep recommending that investors purchase shares of Global Crossing and WorldCom, almost until the moment they went bankrupt. Telecommunications investment banking fees made a fortune for Mr. Weill's company. In 1998, Goldman Sachs tried to lure Mr. Grubman, by then a money machine, to its firm. When the bubble burst, Money magazine at last wondered whether Mr. Grubman was ''the worst analyst ever.''
Mr. Weill had defended Mr. Grubman strongly, telling Business Week that ''Jack probably knows more about the business than anybody I've ever met.'' In fact, Mr. Weill was proud of the so-called synergy between investment banking and commercial banking that he is now seeking to limit. He told two of his biographers that it was the major advantage of his one-stop strategy. ''The one you read about, which has worked out really well, is the connectivity between our Citibank commercial banking business and the corporate investment bank,'' he said, referring to Citigroup's subsidiary, Salomon Brothers.
The hole the financial collapse of 2000 and 2001 left in the economy was soon filled by the housing bubble. John C. Bogle, founder of Vanguard Funds, figures trillions of dollars were lost by the American public. To stimulate the recessionary economy, Mr. Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, drove interest rates very low, and stoked the fires of the mortgage market. And Citigroup, where Mr. Weill remained chairman until 2006, was at the center of the mortgage excesses.
Observers who have been arguing that banks should be broken up shouldn't especially cheer Mr. Weill's conversion to their views. Mr. Weill no longer has anything to lose. And he hasn't come to terms with the damage the financial giants did on his watch, which would have been a true test of his sincerity. Indeed, if he were still running Citigroup, he would almost certainly be singing a different tune.

HEADLINE: U.S. Is Urged to Change Its Firefighting Air Fleet

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The best aircraft to fight the growing number of Western wildfires would be dozens of modern ''scooper'' planes that fill their bellies with water skimmed in seconds from a lake or river, and not the slower helicopters and tankers now in use, according to a study released on Monday by the RAND Corporation. But the chief of the federal Forest Service, which commissioned the study, has rejected its central finding.
The problem is urgent because destructive fires are increasingly frequent, and the existing fleet of planes, leased from private operators, is old and accident prone. Firefighting crashes have killed seven crew members this year. 
According to the RAND report, a quick, pre-emptive attack on an emerging fire could save $3.3 million, on average. Thus, it said, spending more on firefighting planes could save money over all.
Edward G. Keating, an economist who was the study's lead author, said some government agencies leased the scooper planes for $1.5 million to $2.5 million per season; depending on estimates of the destructiveness of fires and the effectiveness of air tankers, it might save money to use up to 55 of them, the study said.
But the Forest Service, which relies on older tanker planes that must land at an airport and be refilled by pumper trucks and which uses only a handful of scoopers, said the RAND study was wrong. The skimmer planes mostly drop water or foam, when often what is needed is fire retardant, said Thomas L. Tidwell, the chief of the Forest Service. And, he said, ''they're underestimating the cost of scoopers and overestimating the cost of tankers.''
Congress is considering a plan submitted by the Forest Service this year to buy C-130J air tankers, a variant of the Pentagon's cargo plane, but those could cost $85 million to $90 million each once refitted to carry fire retardant, government officials say.
The new study and the Forest Service's response highlight fundamental disagreements about how to fight fires. The study, for example, noted a ''dearth of statistical evidence'' about the effectiveness of using air tanker drops on already large fires. It used a term sometimes used by firefighters, who refer to ''CNN drops,'' high-visibility efforts that give the impression of a strong government response.
The study also acknowledged uncertainties about the relative value of water, which is cheap and widely available, and retardant. Some of the water will blow off target or evaporate on the way down, and it will not last long on the ground, so dumping it in the path of a fire may not be effective. (Aircraft do not usually put out fires; they slow them down so workers on the ground can extinguish them or establish a firebreak around them.)
''Often when we're having these large fires, the relative humidity is in the single digits,'' Mr. Tidwell said, and what reaches the ground may be ''just a real light sprinkling.''
The retardant, which is denser and does not evaporate, can penetrate the canopy of leaves if the fire is in a wooded area, experts say, and can be dropped from a higher altitude, reducing risks.
Mr. Keating, the study's lead author, said such operations would be dangerous even with newer equipment. ''There are extremely irregular wind currents because of the heat coming off the fire,'' he said. ''You're at high elevation and low altitude in irregular terrain,'' close to the ground in mountainous areas, ''and, oh, by the way, it's on fire.'' In some crashes, pilots may have become lost in the smoke.
But the RAND study argues that more frequent drops of water may be more effective. A scooper plane, which flies about 100 miles an hour over a river or lake and lowers a small scoop to skim off hundreds of gallons in a few seconds, can manage 60 loads a day if the water is convenient. That may be 10 times the capability of a plane dropping retardant. Two-thirds of the fires fought by the Forest Service are within 10 miles of a suitable body of water, the study said, and fires near towns are even more likely to be near water.
Another goal is to spot emerging fires that can be stopped by dropping water or retardant and focus on those, a challenge that the study called ''dispatch prescience.'' Some firefighting assets, including helicopters, move so slowly that positioning them in places where they are most likely to be needed is an important step.
Firefighting strategy has other complications. Some environmental experts worry that scooper planes, or helicopters that lower buckets to collect water, could spread exotic mussels that contaminate rivers or lakes. And in some places, planes dump saltwater on the soil.
The Forest Service contracts for a variety of aircraft, mostly converted antisubmarine warplanes from the middle of the last century. At times it has used the Bombardier 415, a Canadian plane designed to fight fires. The plane can land on water, but refills its tanks, totaling 1,600 gallons, by skimming water off the surface in a fast pass.
A California company, International Emergency Services, has been trying to market a Russian plane that holds 3,000 gallons. This year, the company flew two Forest Service engineers to Russia to evaluate the plane, the BE-200. David Baskett, the president of International Emergency Services, offered to bring the plane to the United States for a ''flyoff,'' but, he said, the Forest Service has not responded.
Mr. Tidwell said the Federal Aviation Administration had not certified the Russian plane for commercial use. F.A.A. rules would allow the Forest Service to use the plane if it wanted to, but government agencies without extensive in-house expertise in aviation often defer to the F.A.A.
One drawback is price. The Canadian plane's list price is about $35 million. The Russian plane's is about $50 million. Discounts are common, though, for volume purchases.

HEADLINE: Republicans vs. Women

 BODY:
Even with a persistent gender gap in a presidential election year, House Republicans have not given up on their campaign to narrow access to birth control, abortion care and lifesaving cancer screenings. Far from it. 
A new Republican spending proposal revives some of the more extreme attacks on women's health and freedom that were blocked by the Senate earlier in this Congress. The resurrection is part of an alarming national crusade that goes beyond abortion rights and strikes broadly at women's health in general.
These setbacks are recycled from the Congressional trash bin in the fiscal 2013 spending bill for federal health, labor and education programs approved by a House appropriations subcommittee on July 18 over loud objections from Democratic members to these and other provisions.
The measure would bar Planned Parenthood's network of clinics, which serve millions of women across the country, from receiving any federal money unless the health group agreed to no longer offer abortion services for which it uses no federal dollars -- a patently unconstitutional provision. It would also eliminate financing for Title X, the effective federal family-planning program for low-income women that provides birth control, breast and cervical cancer screenings, and testing for sexually-transmitted diseases. Without this program, some women would die, and unintended pregnancies would rise, resulting in some 400,000 more abortions a year and increases in Medicaid-related costs, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a leading authority on reproductive health.
On top of that, the bill would prevent implementation of most of the Affordable Care Act, wiping out its numerous advances for women's health. It would seriously weaken the requirement that employee insurance plans cover birth control and other preventive health services by allowing any employer to opt out based on personal religious beliefs or moral objections.
Pushed by the subcommittee's chairman, Denny Rehberg, a Montana Republican, the budget plan stands little chance of being passed in its current form. Congress is about to leave on its August break, and, without explanation, the full Appropriations Committee's consideration of the bill has been postponed indefinitely. It may be that Speaker John Boehner wants to avoid a controversy heading toward November that shifts focus from the economy.
Even so, the subcommittee's anti-woman work product is a statement of Republican policy. It is endorsed by the full committee chairman, Harold Rogers, and will be a starting point for negotiations on a budget deal with the Senate. Furthermore, when Congress puts forth bad ideas to curtail birth control and abortion access, they tend to spread, helping to inspire copycat bills in the states. Since House Republicans first tried to defund Planned Parenthood, for example, similar attacks have been enacted in six states, most recently in North Carolina earlier this month.
There is a striking overlap between the subcommittee's regressive politics and the polices espoused by the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney. That makes it a window on what a Romney presidency could mean for women's rights and lives.

HEADLINE: A Day Job Waiting for a Kill Shot a World Away

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER

 BODY:
HANCOCK FIELD AIR NATIONAL GUARD BASE, N.Y. -- From his computer console here in the Syracuse suburbs, Col. D. Scott Brenton remotely flies a Reaper drone that beams back hundreds of hours of live video of insurgents, his intended targets, going about their daily lives 7,000 miles away in Afghanistan. Sometimes he and his team watch the same family compound for weeks.''I see mothers with children, I see fathers with children, I see fathers with mothers, I see kids playing soccer,'' Colonel Brenton said.
When the call comes for him to fire a missile and kill a militant -- and only, Colonel Brenton said, when the women and children are not around -- the hair on the back of his neck stands up, just as it did when he used to line up targets in his F-16 fighter jet.
Afterward, just like the old days, he compartmentalizes. ''I feel no emotional attachment to the enemy,'' he said. ''I have a duty, and I execute the duty.'' 
Drones are not only revolutionizing American warfare but are also changing in profound ways the lives of the people who fly them.
Colonel Brenton acknowledges the peculiar new disconnect of fighting a telewar with a joystick and a throttle from his padded seat in American suburbia.
When he was deployed in Iraq, ''you land and there's no more weapons on your F-16, people have an idea of what you were just involved with.'' Now he steps out of a dark room of video screens, his adrenaline still surging after squeezing the trigger, and commutes home past fast-food restaurants and convenience stores to help with homework -- but always alone with what he has done.
''It's a strange feeling,'' he said. ''No one in my immediate environment is aware of anything that occurred.''
Routinely thought of as robots that turn wars into sanitized video games, the drones have powerful cameras that bring war straight into a pilot's face.
Although pilots speak glowingly of the good days, when they can look at a video feed and warn a ground patrol in Afghanistan about an ambush ahead, the Air Force is also moving chaplains and medics just outside drone operation centers to help pilots deal with the bad days -- images of a child killed in error or a close-up of a Marine shot in a raid gone wrong.
Among the toughest psychological tasks is the close surveillance for aerial sniper missions, reminiscent of the East German Stasi officer absorbed by the people he spies on in the movie ''The Lives of Others.'' A drone pilot and his partner, a sensor operator who manipulates the aircraft's camera, observe the habits of a militant as he plays with his children, talks to his wife and visits his neighbors. They then try to time their strike when, for example, his family is out at the market.
''They watch this guy do bad things and then his regular old life things,'' said Col. Hernando Ortega, the chief of aerospace medicine for the Air Education Training Command, who helped conduct a study last year on the stresses on drone pilots. ''At some point, some of the stuff might remind you of stuff you did yourself. You might gain a level of familiarity that makes it a little difficult to pull the trigger.''
Of a dozen pilots, sensor operators and supporting intelligence analysts recently interviewed from three American military bases, none acknowledged the kind of personal feelings for Afghans that would keep them awake at night after seeing the bloodshed left by missiles and bombs. But all spoke of a certain intimacy with Afghan family life that traditional pilots never see from 20,000 feet, and that even ground troops seldom experience.
''You see them wake up in the morning, do their work, go to sleep at night,'' said Dave, an Air Force major who flew drones from 2007 to 2009 at Creech Air Force Base in Nevada and now trains drone pilots at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico. (The Air Force, citing what it says are credible threats, forbids pilots to disclose their last names. Senior commanders who speak to the news media and community groups about the base's mission, like Colonel Brenton in Syracuse, use their full names.)
Some pilots spoke of the roiling emotions after they fire a missile. (Only pilots, all of them officers, employ weapons for strikes.)
''There was good reason for killing the people that I did, and I go through it in my head over and over and over,'' said Will, an Air Force officer who was a pilot at Creech and now trains others at Holloman. ''But you never forget about it. It never just fades away, I don't think -- not for me.''
The complexities will only grow as the military struggles to keep up with a near insatiable demand for drones. The Air Force now has more than 1,300 drone pilots, about 300 less than it needs, stationed at 13 or more bases across the United States. They fly the unmanned aircraft mostly in Afghanistan. (The numbers do not include the classified program of the C.I.A., which conducts drone strikes in Pakistan, Somalia and Yemen.) Although the Afghan war is winding down, the military expects drones to help compensate for fewer troops on the ground.
By 2015, the Pentagon projects that the Air Force will need more than 2,000 drone pilots for combat air patrols operating 24 hours a day worldwide. The Air Force is already training more drone pilots -- 350 last year -- than fighter and bomber pilots combined. Until this year, drone pilots went through traditional flight training before learning how to operate Predators, Reapers and unarmed Global Hawks. Now the pilots are on a fast track and spend only 40 hours in a basic Cessna-type plane before starting their drone training.
Gen. Norton A. Schwartz, the Air Force chief of staff, said it was ''conceivable'' that drone pilots in the Air Force would outnumber those in cockpits in the foreseeable future, although he predicted that the Air Force would have traditional pilots for at least 30 more years.
Many drone pilots once flew in the air themselves but switched to drones out of a sense of the inevitable -- or if they flew cargo planes, to feel closer to the war. ''You definitely feel more connected to the guys, the battle,'' said Dave, the Air Force major, who flew C-130 transport planes in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Now more and more Air National Guard bases are abandoning traditional aircraft and switching to drones to meet demand, among them Hancock Field, which retired its F-16s and switched to Reapers in 2010. Colonel Brenton, who by then had logged more than 4,000 hours flying F-16s in 15 years of active duty and a decade in Syracuse deploying to war zones with the Guard, said he learned to fly drones to stay connected to combat. True, drones cannot engage in air-to-air combat, but Colonel Brenton said that ''the amount of time I've engaged the enemy in air-to-ground combat has been significant'' in both Reapers and F-16s.
''I feel like I'm doing the same thing I've always done, I just don't deploy to do it,'' he said. Now he works full time commanding a force of about 220 Reaper pilots, sensor operators and intelligence analysts at the base.
Pilots say the best days are when ground troops thank them for keeping them safe. Ted, an Air Force major and an F-16 pilot who flew Reapers from Creech, recalled how troops on an extended patrol away from their base in Afghanistan were grateful when he flew a Reaper above them for five hours so they could get some sleep one night. They told him, ''We're keeping one guy awake to talk to you, but if you can, just watch over and make sure nobody's sneaking up on us,'' he recalled.
All the operators dismiss the notion that they are playing a video game. (They also reject the word ''drone'' because they say it describes an aircraft that flies on its own. They call their planes remotely piloted aircraft.)
''I don't have any video games that ask me to sit in one seat for six hours and look at the same target,'' said Joshua, a sensor operator who worked at Creech for a decade and is now a trainer at Holloman. ''One of the things we try to beat into our crews is that this is a real aircraft with a real human component, and whatever decisions you make, good or bad, there's going to be actual consequences.''
In his 10 years at Creech, he said without elaborating, ''I've seen some pretty disturbing things.''
All of the pilots who once flew in cockpits say they do miss the sensation of flight, which for Colonel Brenton extends to the F-16 flybys he did for the Syracuse Memorial Day parade downtown. To make up for it, he sometimes heads out on weekends in a small propeller plane, which he calls a bug smasher.
''It's nice to be up in the air,'' he said.

He died peacefully on August 9th his 80th birthday. Jose Aruego's 82 books for children enchanted a generation of young readers, and critics as well. Working with his wife and long-time collaborator Ariane Dewey, he created a world of joyful animals so full of life that one reviewer termed his style illustrative mime. His characters were spare of line, while still being wonderfully expressive and vivacious. Among their best-known books are Whose Mouse Are You?, Leo the Late Bloomer and Gregory the Terrible Eater. Jose's artistic career was even more remarkable because he was supposed to be a lawyer. He graduated from law school at the University of the Philippines and passed the bar, but his true passion lay in the arts. He came to New York City in 1956 and studied at Parsons School of Design. Jose's career took off when he began penning cartoons. Many were published in the The New Yorker and The Saturday Evening Post. A couple even appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show. Jose and Ariane's first book was published in 1969. He brought his work to life in lectures at elementary schools around the country. Long days in classrooms and auditoriums were made longer by his insistence on sketching a character into every book he signed and teaching students to draw his alligators. Later in life, Jose took up calligraphy and excelled in that as well. Jose's love of travel brought him around the world. Since Jose was such a private person, there will be no funeral service. A memorial will be held in the fall. Jose is survived by his son Juan, the rest of his family and the untold number of people he touched through his art, his quiet charm and his deafening joie de vie. We miss you. </lp><!--NEWARTICLE--><sqn>327283</sqn><len>53</len><pdy>2012</pdy><pdm>08</pdm><pdd>14</pdd><dsk>Classified</dsk><sl>SLUGNAME</sl><edt>Late Edition - Final</edt><pd>20120814023357</pd><se>SECTA</se><pg>20</pg><cl>0</cl><op>scriptLD </op><tom>Paid Death Notice</tom><per>BARNES, HARRY G.</per><hdl>Paid Notice: Deaths<br>BARNES, HARRY G.</hdl><lp>BARNES--Harry G.,Jr., 86, on August 9.

You really blindfolded the string players!), all of the shared confidences, the intimacies, the true friendship, the camaraderie that can only come about when you know someone for about 60 years. We bid you adieu. And Marvin, old friend, nobody ever did so much for so many, and Marvin nobody did it better.

He was 67. The Stuttgart Ballet, which announced his death, did not give the cause.<p>Mr. Cragun, who was born in Sacramento, was 17 when he joined the company in 1962, just as it was beginning to flourish under a new director, John Cranko, who choreographed most of the ballets that Mr. Cragun and Ms. Hayde later came to define by their performances. Before leaving the company in 1996, Mr. Cragun danced the title roles in dozens of dramatic ballets written by Mr. Cranko or his successors, including ''A Streetcar Named Desire,'' ''Orpheus,'' ''The Sleeping Beauty,'' ''Death in Venice'' and ''La Sylphide.''</lp><txt><p>Mr. Cragun's American roots and athleticism were among the defining elements of what was sometimes called the Stuttgart style, an explosive, colorful form of classical ballet driven by storytelling. Flawless triple-turns in midair were his trademark.<p>''He possesses tremendous elevation, there is a cumulative pulse and rhythmic beat to his dancing that is enormously impressive,'' Clive Barnes wrote in The New York Times, describing Mr. Cragun's performance in ''The Taming of the Shrew,'' which the Stuttgart company, based in Germany, brought to the Metropolitan Opera House in 1969. Mr. Cragun, he added, was ''a superb dancer, a man in the category of Rudolf Nureyev or Edward Villella.''<p>Though he also partnered Margot Fonteyn, Gelsey Kirkland and other leading ballerinas of the day, Mr. Cragun's partnership with Ms. Hayde was his most enduring. They lived together as a couple for about a decade, until 1977, and remained close friends until his death.<p>No immediate family members are known to survive.<p>Mr. Cragun, who was born on Oct. 5, 1944, told interviewers that he began taking tap-dancing lessons at 5, and decided to make dancing his profession a few years later, after his father, a college librarian, took him to see ''Singin' in the Rain.'' Donald O'Connor, one of Gene Kelly's co-stars in that movie, was ''my first absolute idol,'' he told People magazine in 1977.<p>He later studied at the Royal Ballet School in London. But, he told People, tap remained at the core of his sensibility as a dancer.<p>''The fact is, I have never given up being and feeling American,'' he said. ''My chorus-line, vaudevillian background is still very much with me. That great American showbiz feeling is present wherever I go and wherever I dance.''<p>Steven Wistrich, who performed with Mr. Cragun as a member of the Stuttgart Ballet in the 1970s and is now artistic director of the City Ballet of San Diego, recalled an incident that illustrated Mr. Cargun's crowd-pleasing show-business instincts. It was in Moscow, in the late '70s after a performance of ''Eugene Onegin,'' with Mr. Cragun and Ms. Hayde in the principal roles.<p>''They are very serious ballet lovers in Moscow, and the audience went crazy, demanding encore after encore, applauding in unison,'' Mr. Wistrich said in a phone interview Thursday. Eventually the orchestra left. But the audience kept clapping, demanding more. So Mr. Cragun and Ms. Hayde took another bow, and gave them what they wanted, Mr. Wistrich said: With the house lights up, and the audience on its feet, ''They repeated an entire pas de deux. In complete silence.''<p>Correction: August 14, 2012, Tuesday<p>This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, an obituary on Saturday about the ballet dancer Richard Cragun misspelled the surname of the performer he called his ''absolute idol.'' He was Donald O'Connor, not O'Conner.</txt><ils>PHOTO: Richard Cragun in ''The Taming of the Shrew'' in 1969. He joined the Stuttgart Ballet in 1962 and left the troupe in 1996.

Two keys carried by two strangers that opened the same apartment door. Twice, the police said, one man let himself inside while the other was away. The first time, the victim was just that -- a victim. The second time, he was ready.<p>The tenant, a college professor of technology, had moved into the apartment in April. It was a quiet walk-up on East 11th Street in Manhattan. The superintendent told the professor, Mr. Lee, that the lock had just been changed.</lp><txt><p>Two months later, on June 12, someone entered the apartment while Mr. Lee, who did not want his full name disclosed, was at work. The burglar stole two video game consoles and other electronics. There was no sign of forced entry, nor any witnesses.<p>''I decided to be more defensive,'' he said.<p>The technology professor tried a couple of surveillance cameras before settling on one made by Dropcam. He placed it in a room where he kept electronic valuables, and set it to constantly record, with the last seven days of video stored online.<p>The view offered a glimpse into a bachelor's pad. The room was messy, not really unpacked. There was a chin-up bar mounted in the door frame and a guitar leaning in the corner, near a microphone on a stand. ''I play guitar with my church,'' he said.<p>On Monday, seven weeks after the burglary, at 3:35 p.m., Mr. Lee's apartment door opened. The camera recorded a man poking his head into the door, then entering.<p>He was young and well put together, with stylish eyeglass frames and a recent haircut. He wore cargo shorts and a Guinness T-shirt and purple gloves and Nikes and a backpack, and looked like a bike messenger or student or the sort of guy that shows up in the East Village in packs of 12 for happy hour and brunch. If it was a disguise, it was inspired.<p>The burglar left the way he came, having taken an iPad, a watch and a wallet filled with old, canceled credit cards.<p>Mr. Lee arrived home and noticed something missing, and quickly logged onto the camera's video, finding a little red flag at the 3:35 p.m. mark, meaning motion had been detected then. He watched and called the police.<p>A lot of surveillance video in New York City is shot from a low-resolution camera mounted on a light pole in the dark. By those standards, Mr. Lee's high-definition video was Oscar-worthy in its framing and lighting and the detail of the suspect.<p>''The police saw the video and thought it was hilarious,'' he said. ''They said it's very rare for a private citizen to have surveillance video in their apartment.'' The police released the video to newspapers and television stations, and Mr. Lee tacked up a homemade flier in a nearby bar.<p>Someone who saw the video called the police, and three days after the burglary, the police arrested a suspect, Piotr Pasciak, 24, of Greenpoint, Brooklyn. A tour of his Facebook page suggests that the hipster look was no disguise. In photograph after photograph, Mr. Pasciak, who had 682 friends as of Friday, can be seen, hair mussed, gazing at himself in a mirror or drinking a bottle of Heineken or a red beverage in a martini glass.<p>The cheery pictures and posts peter out in 2009. That is because Mr. Pasciak was in prison at the time after pleading guilty to charges stemming from three home-invasion burglaries in Otsego County, in which guns and stereo equipment were stolen. Mr. Pasciak pleaded guilty to attempted burglary, a lesser charge.<p>''Pete, keep your head up,'' a friend wrote on his Facebook wall in 2010. ''You will be out soon.'' He was released in January 2011.<p>Over the last few days, people wrote on his wall asking why his phone was not working. His mother, Malgorzata Pasciak, wrote, ''Peter where r u call me.''<p>The police charged him with burglary in both break-ins at Mr. Lee's apartment. His mother defended him in a telephone interview on Friday. ''He's a good guy, and I don't know if that's him or not,'' she said, referring to the burglary video.

The prospects are also increasing pressure on the Obama administration to divert less corn to the production of the biofuel ethanol.</lp><txt><p>Agriculture Secretary Thomas J. Vilsack, visiting drought-stricken farmers in Nebraska on Friday, said that despite the reduced crop production, farmers are in better shape today than during the last major drought, in 1988.<p>''Last time only 25 percent of farmers had crop insurance, but this time over 85 percent are covered,'' Mr. Vilsack said, noting that the government was still forecasting the eighth-biggest corn harvest ever.<p>But analysts warned of falling yields and spiking wholesale prices down the road. ''It's scary when you see the numbers out today,'' said Terry Roggensack, an analyst at the Hightower Report in Chicago. ''Unless there is normal weather and rain from here on out, I can easily see prices for corn and soybeans'' rising 20 percent to 25 percent.<p>In the past month, as the country recorded the hottest month on record, the government lowered its production forecast for eggs, milk and pork. Beef production is expected to rise as ranchers cull more of their herds because of higher feed prices. But experts predict that the price of beef will not rise until next year as supplies tighten but feed costs continue to increase.<p>Last month, the Agriculture Department estimated that food prices would climb 3 percent to 4 percent in 2013. The overall economic effect in the United States, however, will be muted, given that American households generally spend only about 13 percent of their budgets on food and often elect to buy cheaper foods rather than pay higher prices.<p>On Friday, Capital Economics estimated that the rising food prices might knock 0.1 percent off the annual pace of economic growth.<p>Farmers in the hardest hit areas of the Midwest said that Friday's report only confirmed what they already knew.<p>''We've lost 60 percent of our average production, if not 70,'' said Nick Guetterman, president of the Johnson County Farm Bureau in eastern Kansas, who farms about 10,000 acres with his family. Mr. Guetterman said he expected crop insurance to cover his costs this year, but not much more. ''You take what you get, that's all you can do,'' he said. ''You go to church and pray.''<p>The Agriculture Department's report has also renewed debate over the use of corn for ethanol production.<p>The Renewable Fuel Standard, passed in 2005 and expanded in 2007, requires that 13.2 billion gallons of corn-based biofuel be produced in 2012. The goal of the standard is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the nation's dependence on foreign oil.<p>About 40 percent of the nation's corn crop now goes to ethanol producers -- the rest to animal feed, food and exports.<p>Retailers said that they did not expect to have to pass along price increases to customers in the short term.<p>''The drought has had an impact on commodity costs everywhere,'' said John Simley, a spokesman for Kraft Foods, the maker of a range of baked goods and meat products. ''It's not likely to impact our costs in the near term, because of our commodity coverage positions,'' he said, referring to the company's hedges against fluctuations in the markets.<p>But severe weather has hurt agricultural production in other major exporting countries, including Brazil, Russia, Australia and India, not just the United States. That has raised concerns about global shortages of certain food commodities -- shortages that will increase food prices and stoke inflation.<p>''The United States is the world's largest exporter of corn, soybeans and wheat, and likely price spikes will ripple through markets globally, with devastating consequences for those already struggling to get enough food to eat,'' said Eric Munoz, a senior policy analyst with Oxfam, an international aid group.<p>On Thursday, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization said that global food prices jumped 6 percent in July, with the price of corn up 23 percent. It has warned developing countries to prepare for possible price fluctuations.<p>In one impoverished region of Africa, stretching from Senegal in the west to Sudan in the east, Oxfam said that the past five years had seen a significant rise in the price of grains, making the area more vulnerable to any coming food price increases.<p>''There are a number of reactions,'' said Eric Hazard of Oxfam in Dakar, Senegal. ''People diminish the number of meals, and the quality of their meals. We've seen an increase in migration.''<p>Arif Husain, deputy chief of the Food Security Analysis Service at the United Nations World Food Program in Rome, said: ''The real problem is this is the third price shock in the last five years. The poorer countries haven't had time to recover from previous crises.''<p>The Agriculture Department report released on Friday forecast the corn yield to be 123.4 bushels an acre, the lowest in 17 years, down 15.5 percent from its July estimate. It also forecast the yield for soybeans, used in everything from fry oil to livestock feed, to be 36.1 bushels an acre -- down 10.7 percent, or 4.4 bushels an acre below last month's government estimate and 5.4 bushels an acre less than last year.<p>The new estimates are based on surveys of more than 25,000 farmers, as well as Agriculture Department experts inspecting fields for the first time since the drought began to drive up prices in mid-June.<p>The new crop forecast report prompted some commodity futures to rise. On the Chicago Board of Trade, soybean futures were up about 1 percent. Corn futures had already climbed on widespread expectation of a weak report. They declined on Friday, trading for about $8 a bushel, up from about $5.20 in June.<p>Critics of the ethanol fuel standard say the use of corn for ethanol is a major factor in the tripling in the price of corn since 2005. Livestock producers, hard hit by the rise in feed prices, have called on the Obama administration to waive the requirement until the drought is over.<p>''If not now, when?'' said Randy Spronk, a pork farmer in Edgerton, Minn. ''Livestock producers are getting killed out here with feed prices.''<p>Mr. Spronk, the incoming president of the National Pork Producers Council, said livestock producers would have to reduce their herds and flocks because feed was becoming scarce and too expensive.<p>With half the nation's corn crop in poor condition, 156 House members and 25 senators have signed letters to Lisa P. Jackson, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, calling on her to issue a waiver on the ethanol standard.<p>Even the United Nations has called on the United States to ease the use of ethanol.<p>In a letter published in The Financial Times on Friday, Jos Graziano da Silva, the director-general of the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization, wrote: ''An immediate, temporary suspension of that mandate would give some respite to the market and allow more of the crop to be channeled toward food and feed uses.''<p>The ethanol industry said calls to waive the fuel standards were premature.<p>''So far we have nothing more than speculation about what the danger to the corn crop is going to be,'' said Matt Harwig, a spokesman for the Renewable Fuels Association, an ethanol industry trade group. ''We need to take a wait-and-see approach.''<p>Mr. Vilsack, the agriculture secretary, said in an interview taped for C-Span's ''Newsmakers'': ''We still need to get a farm bill passed to help to get some relief for livestock producers who lack a safety net. But American farmers are a resilient bunch. They will get through this.''<p>The report does give farmers an overview of the suffering their peers across the country are experiencing, said Bill Northey, the Iowa secretary of agriculture. That will help farmers make decisions on handling their own crops, like when to cut them and when to sell them, he said.<p>Mr. Northey, who farms in northwest Iowa, said the grim outlook nationwide would lead him to hold onto a lot of his crop until he sees exactly how much his yields are at harvest. If he sold too much now, he said, he would run the risk of not being able to deliver on the sales if the yield turns out lower than expected.<p>''We'll be figuring some of those things out,'' Mr. Northey said. ''But most of it's not going to happen until we get a combine in the field.''<p>Correction: August 14, 2012, Tuesday<p>This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Saturday about a sharp reduction in crop forecasts as a result of the drought omitted reporting credits.

Lessard, chief designer at Supervalu, which operates Cub Foods stores as well as chains like Jewel-Osco, Shaw's and Albertsons in some markets. ''The perimeter is where we can best distinguish ourselves from everyone else.''<p>By center store, Ms. Lessard meant those long, soldier-straight rows of shelves that have long been the heart of the American grocery store but are now showing signs of the grocery equivalent of atherosclerosis. Shopping and eating patterns are changing, and those changes have threatening implications for the food companies whose shelf-stable products have long filled the center store.<p>Analysts have been surprised by the volume of sales declines over the last two quarters. Heinz reported a drop of 2.4 percent in its second quarter. Kraft unit sales were down 2.8 percent in its first quarter, and Kellogg said its North American volumes fell 1.7 percent in its second quarter.<p>With center store sales down, the most forward-looking supermarkets are rethinking the allocation of space -- shrinking the staid center and expanding the sexy perimeter. In the Eagan Cub Foods, for example, the produce, bakery, deli, meat, seafood and other perimeter areas occupy roughly 40 percent of the store, Ms. Lessard said, compared with 20 to 25 percent of Supervalu stores that have yet to be remodeled.<p>''There's been some stagnation in center-of-the-store sales,'' said Jeffrey M. Ettinger, chief executive of Hormel Foods. ''Frankly, I think those of us who sell products there have been a little slow to innovate, and in the meantime, sales around the store perimeter have been strong.''<p>Most major food companies have a presence in both the center and perimeter of the grocery store. Hormel, for instance, is firmly ensconced in one of the hottest areas, the deli section, with its Di Lusso line of cold cuts, while General Mills, maker of Yoplait, is engaged in the yogurt wars raging in the refrigerated cases, another sizzling perimeter section.<p>But food companies are nonetheless concerned at the softening of their business in the center of the store, and they are responding with a variety of tactics, like attempts to add pizazz and flair to the products they sell in the center of the store and making acquisitions that give them a better toehold on the perimeter.<p>Hormel has shortened the cooking time of some of its Compleats microwave meals to 90 seconds and pumped up the flavorings of others -- ginger spicy chicken, for one -- that it sells in the center of the store. It has also begun tweaking packaging, putting stalwarts like Pizza Toppings in the pouches that consumers are suddenly crazy for. Campbell Soup, taking a different tack, recently made its biggest acquisition ever, spending $1.55 billion to buy Bolthouse Farms, a vegetable and juice company that will give it a much bigger presence in places like the entrance of the Cub Foods store here.<p>''It gives us a great platform for the growth that's going on at the perimeter,'' said Anthony Sanzio, a Campbell spokesman. ''The vision is to build on the juice and baby carrots and salad dressings with dips and fresh sauces -- and there will be things we can do with soups and salsas, too.''<p>He said business in the perimeter was growing in part because of the demand from younger consumers for fresh foods and foods that are perceived as wholesome and unprocessed. At the same time, older consumers are looking for healthier foods and juices.<p>That is not to say Campbell will be abandoning the center of the store. It will be introducing soup in pouches later this year with flavors like coconut curry, as well as sparkling energy drinks and jazzier skillet sauces like creamy chipotle with roasted corn.<p>''We don't see the center of the store as a problem, even though the perimeter of the store is growing faster in some stores,'' said Ian R. Friendly, executive vice president of United States retail at General Mills. ''You just need innovation to make it exciting to go down the cereal and snack aisles.''<p>Mr. Friendly pointed to two products General Mills introduced last year -- 90-calorie Fiber One brownies and multigrain peanut butter Cheerios -- as examples of products that will lure today's shoppers to the center aisles.<p>''There are other trends going on that are driving the changes you're seeing,'' he said. ''It used to be that people got their food pretty exclusively at traditional grocery stores, but there has been a pretty important migration to club stores, supercenters, drugstores, convenience stores and dollar stores, where sales have been growing much faster.''<p>Stores like Sam's Club and Target have put pressure on grocery stores to cut prices, while the other outlets offer convenience. It is much easier to buy staples like milk and butter at a convenience store or gas station than to hike all the way to the back of a grocery store, where those items traditionally are stocked -- which is why more grocers now have small dairy cases at the front of their stores.<p>At the other end of the spectrum, Whole Foods and Trader Joe's have upped the ante by introducing an element of Cirque du Soleil into the grocery business and proving that there are big profits in fresh produce, which was previously considered a risky business.<p>''There were big implications in how Whole Foods went about merchandising the types of products it was carrying,'' said Andrew Waldeck, senior partner at Innosight, a consulting firm. ''They do a lot of sampling, a lot of labeling and signs, all in an effort to create a sense of transparency and demonstrate the freshness and healthiness of what they're selling.<p>''That was exactly where the consumer was going, and everyone else in the grocery business, everyone, has had to figure out how to go along, which has made big changes in their business models and particularly in their real estate.''<p>Shoppers also are shopping differently, retailers and consumer experts say. ''Generally, for grocery and food products, people are shopping much more frequently today than just a few years ago,'' said Michael R. Minasi, president of marketing at Safeway. ''They're coming in for a fresh produce transaction, for tonight's dinner transaction. I think the bigger shift has to do with how people are using grocery stores than with specific categories of food that are on the perimeter or in the center.''<p>Mr. Minasi said Safeway was not deliberately taking space away from the center of the store and reallocating it to perimeter areas. Rather, he said, ''we continue to evolve the stores to be more relevant to shoppers and focus on what's important to them. Right now, that's health and wellness, and those products tend to be prevalent in the perimeter of the store.''<p>Correction: August 14, 2012, Tuesday<p>This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Saturday about supermarkets' increasing focus on produce, deli and other fresh-food sections misspelled the surname of a partner at the consulting firm Innosight who commented on such practices at Whole Foods.

She seemed to have little in common with those said to be her accomplices: among them, a police officer charged with stealing his colleagues' guns to support a painkiller habit and two unemployed young men from Brooklyn and Queens charged with selling guns and drugs.<p>The prosecutor, who opposed bail for most of the defendants, pointed out to the judge in State Supreme Court in Manhattan why each one might be a risk for flight. When it came to Ms. Sultan, 38, every head in the courtroom swiveled at the main point: she had once been a dot-com millionaire.</lp><txt><p>The finer details were not mentioned that day: at the high-water mark, she and her boyfriend were co-founders of a small Internet company that sold for $70 million. They rented a summer house in the Hamptons for $400,000. They bought a 6,000-square-foot loft on East 17th Street just off Fifth Avenue.<p>Now, a little more than a decade later, Ms. Sultan is bankrupt and sitting in a jail cell, unable to pull together $85,000 for bail. If convicted, she faces 15 years to life in prison on charges of selling prescription painkillers to an undercover police officer and of trying to sell a .357 Magnum to the man accused of being the ringleader.<p>Her life has in some ways followed the arc of her times, with even more extreme swings.<p>She rode the euphoria of the late-1990s technology stock boom to apparent riches at age 25, saw those fortunes collapse with the stock market in the early 2000s and was unable to stage a comeback in the more sober recession era.<p>To some who have known Ms. Sultan, her overwhelming ambition and dalliances with wilder crowds as a young adult in Manhattan made her fall less surprising. But to others, including her close family, the collapse has been bewildering.<p>''We are treading on water that we have never treaded on before,'' said her mother, Brenda Sultan. ''She is such a sweet, thoughtful person.''<p>She grew up as the middle child between two brothers in West Long Branch, N.J., five miles north of Asbury Park. Her father, David Sultan, owned a dry-cleaning business. Her mother had grown up in Brooklyn and dreamed of an idyllic suburban life for her children. They lived that life in a modest colonial-style house at the end of a quiet cul-de-sac.<p>Her mother recalls the terror of watching Jennifer, at just 2 years old, perched at the end of a diving board over the deep end of a swimming pool.<p>''Everybody, look at me!'' she shouted as she leapt.<p>That physical confidence evolved into athletic prowess when she was a student at Shore Regional High School. Jennifer excelled in five sports: soccer, field hockey, softball, swimming and diving.<p>''She was tough,'' Mrs. Sultan recalled. ''She is, in fact, a girlie girl, but she's also very athletic.''<p>Young Jennifer filled stacks of journals with her thoughts and dreamed of writing children's books. In her senior year of high school, she smiled confidently in her yearbook above a long passage she had written.<p>''Like a small child I climb up the stairway of life. Have I come to the end or have I only just begun?'' the text began. ''My collected visions have enabled me to keep dreaming. I must go now, my life awaits.''<p>FOR Ms. Sultan, the city that her mother had left behind held great allure. She was accepted to New York University, her first choice, where she studied literature.<p>''She just fell in love with the city, and N.Y.U. was a fabulous opportunity for her,'' her mother said. ''She did extremely well. She blossomed in college.''<p>She became interested in photography and while still in college parlayed that into freelance work taking pictures of rock stars, including David Bowie and the members of Aerosmith, in posed settings and during concerts, according to her mother and a business associate.<p>Ms. Sultan rented a duplex apartment on East 13th Street near Fifth Avenue, and to help with expenses, she sublet the downstairs unit. She found the tenant, Adam Cohen, through mutual friends. They became business partners and were eventually engaged.<p>Several people who knew Mr. Cohen and Ms. Sultan professionally said they could seem like an unlikely pair. They are close in age but different in disposition. Whereas he bordered on reclusive, she basked in the club life of Lower Manhattan and was regularly out all night.<p>''Jen was always going out,'' said one associate from the 1990s, who like several others would speak only anonymously because of the seriousness of the crimes Ms. Sultan was charged with. ''She knew people from all these different scenes. Adam wasn't into any of that.''<p>Mr. Cohen was working for a company called Styleworks Interactive that put together designer-fashion shows at the Hotel InterContinental, the former associate said. Mr. Cohen and Ms. Sultan, who graduated from N.Y.U. in 1996, have said they came up with the idea to stream the fashion shows on the Internet, then a new concept. Ms. Sultan also mentioned to work associates a desire to live-stream the music events she photographed.<p>The owner of the company, Debra LaChance, spun off Styleworks, later renamed Live Online. The company, with fewer than two dozen employees, including Mr. Cohen and Ms. Sultan, quickly gained a foothold in the new world of live streaming, handling events for MTV, Arista Records and other entertainment companies.<p>In January 2000, two months before the dot-com bubble reached its high point, Digital Island, a company that had gone public the year before, bought Live Online in a deal valued at $70 million.<p>It was an occasion for celebration and fleeting excess.<p>That summer, Mr. Cohen and Ms. Sultan rented an 11-bedroom house in the Hamptons for $400,000, The New York Observer reported at the time.<p>''There are people who just don't know what to do'' with their money, the real estate agent who rented the property told The Observer.<p>A few months later, the couple bought the loft on East 17th Street for $3.1 million. It was one of six floor-through apartments in an eight-story building.<p>Mrs. Sultan recalls that there was ''a lot of excitement'' after the sale of Live Online.<p>''But it was not long lived,'' she said.<p>THOUGH it was valued at $70 million, the Live Online deal involved only $5.25 million in cash. The rest of the price was paid in Digital Island stock, nearly 800,000 shares, valued at about $81 a share.<p>The Live Online crew never saw that much money. Technology stocks peaked in March 2000. By the time their shares were offered for sale, the value had been cut by more than half. A year after that, Digital Island was bought by Cable and Wireless, a British telecom company, for $3.40 a share, so stock that had once been worth $65.9 million was worth just $2.7 million.<p>And Ms. Sultan's share of the deal was relatively small. She received 5 percent of those Digital Island shares, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr. Cohen received 37 percent. Ms. LaChance, who declined to comment for this article, and her brother-in-law, Victor Starsia, a lawyer, received 48 percent of the shares. People with knowledge of the deal said Ms. LaChance, who had put up the money to found Live Online, received most of the cash from the sale.<p>Charles Picasso, who was the chief operating officer for Digital Island, said Mr. Cohen and Ms. Sultan were involved with the new company for a few months after the merger. But they were phased out, Mr. Picasso said, as Digital Island took more control.<p>In 2002, they started another business of their own, Global Media Services.<p>''We are the inventors of all things streaming!!!'' Ms. Sultan says of the company on her personal Facebook page.<p>In 2003, Global Media was taken over by Newsplayer Group, a British company that had the journalist and comedian David Frost on its board and marketed videos of his interviews. The merger does not appear to have gone well. In 2005, Mr. Cohen and Ms. Sultan bought the company back for $100 and a promise to pay 15 percent in royalties to the British company, by then called Catalyst Media Group, according to court records.<p>Their personal finances were already strained. They had stopped paying property taxes on their loft, according to court records, and had taken out a total of $4 million in mortgages on the loft that required $27,000 in monthly payments.<p>Ms. Sultan began pursuing a new interest: acupuncture and holistic medicine. She took classes at the Pacific College of Oriental Medicine a few blocks north of the loft, while remaining involved in Global Media with Mr. Cohen.<p>''Always a pioneer, Sultan plans to integrate her knowledge of technology with the holistic medical field to help bring alternative and complementary healing to the forefront of Western culture,'' her biography on the Global Media Services Web site said at the time, according to an archive of Web pages at archive.org.<p>Her mother saw the change as part of a progression.<p>''She's a natural healer; all she wanted to do was help people,'' Mrs. Sultan said. ''She was no longer interested in technology, but it was still her bread and butter.''<p>But Ms. Sultan and Mr. Cohen's actions, as described by former associates and court records, appeared to grow increasingly erratic. Ms. Sultan's lawyer in the criminal case, Frank Rothman, said she had developed an addiction to pain medication prescribed to treat back pain from the sports she played as a child and a fall she took in her apartment.<p>In April 2009, Global Media merged again, this time with GridNetworks, a Seattle-based company founded to deliver content over the Internet. In an odd coincidence, GridNetworks' investors brought in Mr. Picasso, the former chief operating officer of Digital Island, to head the new company.<p>''On behalf of the whole team, I wanted to express how excited I am to be working closely with you again!'' Mr. Cohen wrote in an e-mail to Mr. Picasso in May 2009. ''I am looking forward to making Global Media Services a big success.''<p>But the deal quickly collapsed. The staff of 11 in Seattle sued six months later, saying the employees had not been paid before being laid off in July. In court papers, Mr. Picasso accused Mr. Cohen of draining $700,000 from the company on the day of the merger. Mr. Picasso dropped his lawsuit and the accusation was not resolved.<p>Mr. Picasso said he quit in July 2009, on the day he learned that a contract with MTV that Mr. Cohen had said should still be generating revenue had actually been canceled months earlier. Now retired in Northern California, the French-born Mr. Picasso, 71, said that both Mr. Cohen and Ms. Sultan ''behaved very strangely,'' though he declined to elaborate.<p>''For me it was a very, very bad time and a lot of stress,'' he said. ''I always not only follow the rules, but I have some ethics and values. That was the first time I was confronted with someone who was completely different.''<p>Mr. Cohen did not respond to phone messages and e-mails seeking comment. But in court papers he has denied wrongdoing in his business matters, and generally blamed others for the difficulties his businesses have faced.<p>In October 2009, Mr. Cohen and Ms. Sultan stopped making the mortgage payments on their loft. Two months later, their company was evicted from its office space for failure to pay rent. In June 2010, Bank of America started foreclosure proceedings on their home; six months later, Mr. Cohen and Ms. Sultan filed for personal bankruptcy as a married couple, even though they have never married.<p>Last year, they told the judge presiding over the bankruptcy case, Shelley C. Chapman, that they were still best friends but were no longer engaged. Still, Mr. Cohen continued to call Ms. Sultan his fiance.<p>''We were engaged for 10 years,'' Mr. Cohen told the judge. ''And I still use the term, but this relationship has broken up a long time ago.''<p>They have been selling a line of designer biker jewelry called Chrome Hearts on eBay and are trying to start new businesses. But they claim to have no income.<p>''We are living like animals, without any ability to provide for ourselves,'' Mr. Cohen told the judge last October.<p>''You're living it like animals in a 10 million-dollar apartment,'' Judge Chapman retorted. ''I'm really not going to listen to this. I'm really not.''<p>In January, they told the judge that Ms. Sultan was about to open an acupuncture business in the Union Square area. Mr. Cohen praised her creativity in getting the business started.<p>''She's a little bit delayed with getting the final permits from the state to practice, so this is being done under another practitioner's license,'' Mr. Cohen said to the judge. ''But I just want to say that I'm personally in awe of what she's accomplished here. It's creative and substantial commercially.''<p>Ms. Sultan, who has typically let Mr. Cohen do the talking in court, said to the judge that the business had not yet opened but was already ''kind of blowing the doors open.''<p>''So it's been a very exciting adventure,'' she said. ''I'm obviously a very good business person, and have, and have the ability to bring on many other practitioners. So I have a plan to basically multiply revenue pretty quickly.''<p>BUT law enforcement authorities say she generated revenue in other ways.<p>In February, a city narcotics detective found an advertisement Ms. Sultan had placed on Craigslist offering prescription pain pills for sale, and arranged a meeting with her, according to the Manhattan Office of the Special Narcotics Prosecutor. Five times from February through June, she sold pills to an undercover officer, according to her indictment. One sale took place at the Starbucks on Union Square near the loft. In another, she sold 183 oxycodone tablets to the officer for $4,400 at a Starbucks a block from her acupuncture school.<p>A separate investigation into the ring that sold stolen guns and pain medication picked up Ms. Sultan sending a text message to the man accused of being the ringleader, Ivan Chavez, saying she wanted to sell him a .357 Magnum handgun for $850, according to a separate indictment by the Manhattan district attorney.<p>The police burst through the doors of the loft on July 12 and arrested Ms. Sultan. As she was led through the halls of State Supreme Court in Manhattan to be arraigned, she contorted her neck and torso to hide her face from news cameras, trying to avoid the attention she had commanded for most of her life.<p>No charges have been filed against Mr. Cohen. The two former entrepreneurs are facing a contempt charge in the bankruptcy case. Two lawyers have stopped representing them, with one telling the court that Ms. Sultan and Mr. Cohen had lied to him; the pair are now representing themselves in court. The judge and the trustee have accused them of trying to delay the sale of the apartment, which they have said is their only asset. The trustee listed the apartment for $6.25 million, which would leave them nothing after paying off debts.<p>Mr. Cohen has interfered with showings and frightened at least one real estate broker, according to court records.<p>''At a broker open house on July 2, 2012, I noticed that Cohen was carrying a handgun in the back of his pants,'' a broker with the Corcoran Group said in a sworn affidavit. ''The gun was clearly visible through his white shirt. Seeing this terrified me.''<p>Since the arrest, Ms. Sultan has remained on Rikers Island without the resources to make bail.<p>Ms. Sultan's mother, who moved to Florida 15 years ago, says she hopes for redemption for her daughter, of the sort described by a younger Jennifer Sultan in that high school yearbook 20 years ago. ''Falling down along the way, I must pick myself up and proceed with my journey,'' she wrote.</txt><ils>PHOTOS: IN COURT: Jennifer Sultan, 38, faces charges including selling prescription painkillers to an undercover officer.

HEADLINE: Big Housing Project Planned Near Shrinking Salton Sea

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA

 BODY:
OASIS, Calif. -- Signs of once grandiose dreams dot the shoreline of the Salton Sea, dried up like the dead fish that bob ashore from time to time. This lake, the largest in California, was once supposed to be the Riviera of the West, a playground for stars like Frank Sinatra, Jerry Lewis and Desi Arnaz.
But the Salton Sea, created by accident 40 miles south of Palm Springs, has been shrinking for decades now, while the saline content continues to rise -- it is roughly 50 percent saltier than the Pacific Ocean. Waterfront homes built more than a generation ago sit abandoned and boarded up, on a labyrinth of streets where only a couple of houses on each block are occupied.
But California does not give up easily on its dreams, so yet another ambitious development is poised to rise beside this vanishing sea. 
Government officials have approved plans for a town that would eventually grow to nearly 40,000 people, with enough businesses and jobs to support the residents. Supporters of the project say it is the most sustainable development being planned in the state, but the town, known as Travertine Point, would be more than 20 miles from any existing town.
In many ways, the project is a sign of the state's insatiable appetite for new development, even in Riverside County, east of Los Angeles, which has struggled through the building bust and foreclosure crisis. This might be among the most unlikely places in the county to contemplate a superdevelopment, but officials are unabashed in their enthusiasm and say the optimism is firmly grounded in reality.
''Recreational bodies of water don't stay unoccupied forever,'' said John Benoit, the Riverside County supervisor who represents the area and pushed for the project's approval. ''You can either take development piecemeal as it comes, or invest in something that is really taking the long-term view of creating comprehensive, unprecedented development.''
But environmental advocates have cried foul, filing a lawsuit in state court claiming that the project will irreparably harm the natural resources in the area. More than that, they say, the idea is just plain absurd.
''It's one of the greatest examples of dumb growth you could possibly conjure up,'' said Adam Keats, a staff lawyer at the Center for Biological Diversity, which with the Sierra Club is suing to stop the project. ''It's located very far away from the rest of civilization in a place that is very difficult to live. The notion that this could be a Shangri-La is something we should have given up a long time ago.''
The developers, Federated Insurance, based in Owatonna, Minn., dismiss such criticism as misplaced and unimaginative.
The plans call for 16,000 homes and five million square feet of commercial space, along with parks lining streets with low speed limits. The approved plans say a minimum number of jobs must be created for each phase.
Paul Quill, who is managing the project, argues that this is the most sustainable project that has ever been built in the area. ''We're not talking about just putting up a bunch of houses and walking away,'' he said.
The streets are designed to be walkable. Even in triple-digit temperatures here, Mr. Quill said, people are willing to step outside in the morning and evening. There are plans for affordable housing as well as high-priced sprawling homes that will be marketed to executives who work in the geothermal industry just to the south.
Developers acknowledge that it will be decades before the plans are completed and say they do not intend to break ground for at least three years, when they hope the housing market and the local economy are showing signs of improvement. But they say they need approvals as soon as they can get them so the land's value will increase.
''Everyone looks at this sea as a problem, not a resource,'' Mr. Quill said. ''But it could provide an opportunity economically and environmentally because it's not the dead sea everyone talks about.''
Although Mr. Quill has lived in the area for more than 20 years, his first time in the lake was last year, when a friend took him kayaking. ''We have mountain views, we have sea views, all kinds of access to walking and hiking and biking and off-roading,'' he said. ''There's so many things that are going to attract people here.''
But whether the sea will even exist in a decade remains in question. Under a water transfer agreement approved by the state, water from nearby agricultural developments will stop flowing in by 2018, which means the shores, which now shrink about seven inches a year, will recede more quickly and dust levels in the area will rapidly increase.
''It's like shutting off the only faucet they have,'' said Michael Cohen, a researcher with the Pacific Institute, a nonprofit group based in San Francisco. ''There has long been a slow decline, but this will have a far more dramatic change because species cannot adapt that quickly.''
The Imperial Irrigation District is asking the state for permission to allow it to stop sending water to the sea even sooner.
Mr. Quill says the project could go ahead even if the Salton Sea was never restored. Still, the plans include drawings for a marina -- besides the handful of imagined docks are images of boats, wind surfers and a lighthouse. Mr. Quill is starting a business group to raise money for the restoration of the area, which would ideally include a recreation area at the northern end.
Right now, the only kind of fish surviving in the water are tilapia, which normally live in fresh water but can be found in abundance here. On some days when the heat reaches beyond 110 degrees, it is possible to smell them from outside the water.
None of this is enough to bother the hearty souls who choose to live here or visit regularly.
''Those are good eating fish,'' said Liz Ricci, who has been coming to the area with her family since the 1960s. ''The saddest thing is that the sea hasn't changed. It's gotten saltier, but you only know if you have your chemistry set. It's as good as it ever was, but the people just stopped coming.''
The decline in popularity, as Ms. Ricci and other boosters of the lake will relate, happened slowly over the years as the salt content and algae increased and fish began dying off.
As Mr. Benoit put it, ''Eventually it got to the point where it was unpleasant and not marketable.''
Ms. Ricci, in some ways, considers herself lucky. For years, the state park here had as many visitors as Yosemite. Now, on many weekends, her family members have the lake to themselves, where they can ''ski forever without getting chills.''
Correction: August 6, 2012, Monday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Monday about plans for a housing project near the Salton Sea in California misidentified the city where the project's developer, Federated Insurance, is based. It is Owatonna, Minn., not Milwaukee.

HEADLINE: Awaiting Action On Promises In Europe

BYLINE: By JACK EWING

 BODY:
FRANKFURT -- Mario Draghi demonstrated last week how a few choice words from a central bank chief can make or break fortunes, even those of whole nations.
Now the president of the European Central Bank faces the much more complicated task of delivering on last week's promise to do ''whatever it takes to preserve the euro.''
He will have a chance to give substance to that bold statement on Thursday when the bank's governing council meets.
With expectations so high, anything short of a decisive display of financial firepower could send financial markets back to the panicky behavior of only a week ago -- when the thin trading of summer was exaggerating stock market gloom and bond investors were bidding up the borrowing costs of Spain and Italy to potentially destructive levels. 
Mr. Draghi's vow last week and his assurance that ''it will be enough'' sent stocks up worldwide and drove Spanish borrowing costs down from their lofty levels.
Investors concluded that Mr. Draghi was signaling a major policy action, like huge purchases of government bonds to raise demand for debt from Spain and Italy and keep their borrowing costs at sustainable levels.
Nearly identical statements by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, President Francois Hollande of France and Prime Minister Mario Monti of Italy in recent days further raised expectations, though it was unclear if they all had the same policies in mind.
Controlling the bond market may not be as simple as it sounds, though, even for an institution that has the power to print money. Nor, analysts said, are there many other easy or effective options for the European Central Bank, which serves the 17 European Union nations who use the euro.
Under its current charter, the central bank faces more restrictions on its ability to buy government bonds and stimulate the economy than the Federal Reserve does.
While the European bank is supposed to defend price stability above all else and is barred from financing governments, the Fed's mandate puts more emphasis on promoting employment, and it has bought hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of Treasury securities.
But even the Fed, whose policy-making committee meets Tuesday and Wednesday, is struggling to find ways to help the economy when its main tool, managing a benchmark interest rate, is close to zero. And the central bank's benchmark interest rate, which has been cut three times since Mr. Draghi took his post last fall, is at a record low, at 0.75 percent. But in Europe, those low rates have not been passed on to business and consumers in countries like Spain and Italy because their banking systems are dysfunctional.
''They are in regions below 1 percent where the interest rate is basically impotent,'' said Jeffrey Bergstrand, a professor of finance at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana and former Fed economist. ''The only thing that can help is fiscal stimulus,'' he said -- in other words, government spending by countries like Germany that can afford it.
That may, in fact, be the message that Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, delivers Monday when he meets his German counterpart, Wolfgang Schauble, on the resort island of Sylt off the German coast. The United States has repeatedly pressed euro zone governments to be much more forceful in battling the crisis, which has been a drag on the global economy.
The European Central Bank has bought bonds before under a program begun by Mr. Draghi's predecessor, Jean-Claude Trichet. But that failed to hold down borrowing costs for countries like Spain because the bank had not committed enough money or show enough determination. Any new round of bond-buying would have to be more impressive.
''What can they do and what would bring about a sustained turnaround in market confidence?'' said Jacques Cailloux, chief European economist at Nomura in London. ''There I struggle to find something that would really be convincing.''
In theory, the central bank could cap bond prices simply by declaring that it would not tolerate market interest rates for Spain above, say, 7 percent. Any speculator who might want to bet against Spanish debt would confront the risk of big losses if the central bank bought bonds in grand style on the open market to drive down yields, the effective interest rates.
If the threat was credible enough, the bank might not actually have to carry it out.
That, however, is where the task becomes more tangled. For the central bank to be sufficiently intimidating, it would have to violate some existing taboos.
For example, it would have to abandon its practice of offsetting its bond purchases by taking in equal amounts in commercial bank deposits. By absorbing deposits, the bank takes as much cash out of the system as it puts in via bond purchases. By keeping the supply of money in the economy approximately even, it tries to avoid the appearance that it is printing money.
But already, the bank has struggled some weeks to attract enough interest-earning deposits from commercial banks to cover the bond purchases it has already made, valued at 212 billion euros, or $260.7 billion.
The European Central Bank would also probably have to stop treating itself as a privileged creditor -- something it did this year during the Greek bailout. By refusing to absorb losses on Greek bonds as private creditors were forced to, it may have unintentionally raised borrowing costs for other troubled countries.
Investors concluded that, if any country could not meet its obligations, private creditors would once again bear all the pain.
A decision to accept losses on the bank's holdings of Greek bonds would be a significant policy shift, though, and raise other difficult questions. Certainly the Greek government would rejoice if its debt load dropped by 20 billion euros or so -- or even more if the European Union also took losses on its holdings.
But in Germany, where the public debate is still focused on teaching Greece a lesson, the reaction would be outrage. The rumblings of discontent could already be heard Friday, a day after Mr. Draghi's ''whatever it takes'' pledge. The Bundesbank, Germany's powerful central bank, reiterated that it remained opposed to bond purchases because they push the central bank into the realm of financing governments, a violation of its charter.
Dissent by Germany, the euro zone's biggest financier, would raise questions about the bank's resolve and very likely blunt the effectiveness of bond market intervention. That has been a problem in the past.
''Technically it's easy,'' Charles Wyplosz, a professor of economics at the Graduate Institute in Geneva, said of the bank's putting a cap on government borrowing costs. But ''there will be an uproar in Germany,'' he quickly added. ''The politics are too complicated.''
Mr. Draghi, a clever economist and seasoned policy maker, may devise a way through this political and legal minefield. He has so far avoided a public dispute with Jens Weidmann, the Bundesbank president, and the two are said to enjoy a collegial relationship, perhaps leaving room for compromise.
Analysts have suggested, for example, that the European bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Facility, could be deployed to buy Spanish and Italian bonds. Unlike the central bank itself, the bailout fund is empowered to buy bonds directly from governments. It would also assume the job of making sure that Spain and Italy fulfill promises to reduce debt and restructure their economies.
Then, the thinking goes, the central bank could buy bonds on the open market as needed to put added downward pressure on borrowing costs.
But this mechanism would take time to carry out, which raises the question of what other, quicker steps the bank could agree to at its meeting on Thursday to satisfy the expectations that Mr. Draghi has raised.
The benchmark interest rate, cut to 0.75 percent from 1 percent in early July, could be cut again -- to 0.5 percent or even 0.25 percent.
The central bank, though, has direct control only over the rates at which it lends to commercial banks. The effect on the interest rates that businesses and consumers actually pay would probably be minimal, especially in countries like Greece or Spain that need help most. Banks in those countries are focused on just surviving and are not lending much.
There might be other benefits, though. Already, the euro has declined in value against the dollar partly in response to the interest rate cut in early July. Economists differ on how much a weaker euro really helps exporters, whose products become less expensive in dollar terms.
''Given the situation in the euro area and the rest of the world, there can be no better news than that the euro is finally depreciating,'' Mr. Wyplosz said, though he cautioned that weak global demand could blunt the effect.
Perhaps the most important impact of another cut would simply be to signal that the central bank is willing to break new ground to save the common currency -- even if it is not totally clear what surprises Mr. Draghi may have in store.
The July cut ''was a very strong signal the E.C.B. was more flexible,'' Mr. Cailloux said. ''It is open to more cuts if needed and not ruling out unconventional measures.''

HEADLINE: The Entitled Generation

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER

 BODY:
IF you were born before 1946 or after 1964, you are free to go. Kindly close the door on your way out. I need a private moment with my fellow baby boomers.
So. I imagine you're all feeling a little unappreciated these days. We seem to have entered one of our periodic seasons of boomer-bashing. In rapid Op-Ed succession, we children of the postwar demographic bulge have been blamed for turning religion into an indulgent free-for-all, for giving elites a bad name and for making greed respectable, or at least acceptable. That's just this month, and just on this page. And it's not only conservatives beating us with the Woodstock whip. Kurt Andersen, a confessed liberal and one of our more prolific cultural omnivores, started the latest thumping July 4 with an argument that amoral self-gratification is just the flip side of social liberation: ''Thanks to the '60s, we are all shamelessly selfish.'' 
The notion that our generation has been spoiled rotten is not a terribly new thought. A dozen years ago Paul Begala (of Bill Clinton and CNN fame) published in Esquire the classic of boomer-loathing, ''The Worst Generation.'' ''The Baby Boomers are the most self-centered, self-seeking, self-interested, self-absorbed, self-indulgent, self-aggrandizing generation in American history,'' he declared. It's a sturdy genre. Perhaps while Googling yourself you have come across the blog Boomer Deathwatch (''Because one day, they'll all be dead''), a checklist of famous boomers who hit their actuarial sell-by dates. Even Barack Obama, who styles himself post-boomer though he was born in 1961, complained in ''The Audacity of Hope'' that today's hyperpolarized political discourse began with the ''psychodrama of the baby boom generation.''
Yes, yes, this criticism is glib. We didn't start the war in Vietnam, but members of our generation fought both in it and against it, demonstrating some of the spirit of sacrifice we are not famous for. Our ranks include the outsourcers of Bain and the wizards of the Wall Street casino, but also the entrepreneurial genius of Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. The Bill Clinton of Monicagate was the first boomer president, but so was the Bill Clinton of relative peace and prosperity. Our record-buying dollars gave the world disco -- so sorry about that -- but also Motown and Springsteen. I'd say the argument will continue forever if that didn't sound like such an all-about-us, boomer thing to say.
But even though the caricature is way too easy, it has stuck, and we all know that it contains more than a nugget of truth. We are an entitled bunch.
This brings me to a soon-to-be released study by the incorrigible pragmatists at Third Way, the centrist Democratic think tank. The study takes a familiar refrain and presents it with a graphic wallop. Though it was intended as a wake-up call, not an indictment of a generation, it can be read as both.
The authors examined two categories of federal spending over the past 50 years, representing two of government's fundamental missions. One was ''investments,'' which includes maintaining our national infrastructure, keeping our military equipped, helping assure that our work force is educated to a high standard, and underwriting the kind of basic scientific research that is too risky or long-term to attract private money. The report calls this the legacy of President Kennedy's New Frontier, though the largest infrastructure project in our history, the interstate highway system, was Eisenhower's baby, a reminder of the days when Republicans still believed in that stuff. The other category was ''entitlements,'' a catchall word for the safety-net programs that provide a measure of economic stability for the aging and poor: Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, etc.
You will not be surprised to hear that the red line tracking entitlements goes up while the blue line reflecting investments goes down. What is alarming is the trajectory.
In 1962, we were laying down the foundations of prosperity. About 32 cents of every federal dollar, excluding interest payments, was spent on investments, only 14 percent on entitlements. In the mid-70s the lines crossed. Today we spend less than 15 cents on investment and 46 cents on entitlements. And it gets worse. By 2030, when the last of us boomers have surged onto the Social Security rolls, entitlements will consume 61 cents of every federal dollar, starving our already neglected investment and leaving us, in the words of the study, with ''a less-skilled work force, lower rates of job creation, and an infrastructure unfit for a 21st-century economy.''
Some of the entitlement bloat comes from the addition of new programs -- notably the prescription drug benefit espoused by our second boomer president, George W. Bush, and the Affordable Care Act, though at least that law sets in motion offsetting measures aimed at containing the soaring cost of health care. Some of the growth is built into formulas that increase benefits faster than inflation or G.D.P. And a lot of it is us: boomers, aging into Social Security and Medicare. ''We've reached the point where our working-age population over the next 30 years grows by one-fifth, and our elderly population grows 100 percent,'' said Jim Kessler, the senior vice president for policy at Third Way.
Indignant readers are already revving up to tell me that Social Security and Medicare are sacred promises, that cutting them would be stone-hearted Republicanism. A.A.R.P., the lobby for people we used to call senior citizens until we realized that meant us, got hammered by the left earlier this year when its C.E.O. dared to convene a meeting of Washington insiders to even discuss the subject. No wonder A.A.R.P. shies away from supporting any entitlement reform.
But the traditional liberal alternatives -- raise taxes on the well-to-do, cut military spending -- are not nearly enough by themselves. The arithmetic simply doesn't work, unless we face the fact that entitlements are a bargain we can't afford to keep, not in full.
So the question is not whether entitlements have to be brought under control, but how. The Republican plan espoused by Mitt Romney and his fiscal lodestar Paul Ryan would cut the cost of entitlements largely by moving toward privatization: personal investment accounts for Social Security, vouchers for Medicare. And it's not at all clear the Republicans would assign any of the savings to investing in our future.
At least the Republicans have a plan. The Democrats generally recoil from the subject of entitlements. Centrists like those at Third Way and the bipartisan authors of the Simpson-Bowles report endorse a menu of incremental cuts and reforms that would bring down costs without hitting the needy or snatching away the security blanket from those nearing retirement. They include gradually raising the retirement age to compensate for the fact that we now live, on average, 14 years longer than when F.D.R. signed Social Security into law. They include obliging those of us who can really afford it to pay a larger share. They also include technical fixes like aligning the automatic cost-of-living formula with reality. To curtail the raging inflation of health costs, the government could better use its market clout to hasten electronic record-keeping, replace the fee-for-service model, reform medical malpractice laws and promote living wills. (A quarter of health care spending comes in the last year of life.) But you won't hear much of that on the campaign trail.
FELLOW boomers, we have done more than our share to make this mess. It's not our fault that there are a lot of us, but we have resisted any move to fix the system. We should make a sensible reform of entitlements our generation's cause. We should stiffen the spines of our politicians, and push lobby groups like A.A.R.P. to climb out of the bunker and lead. (And, by the way, we should resist the boomer temptation to take every cent of the reform from the pockets of our kids.) We should keep the heat on Congress and the president to double down on the cost-saving provisions in Obamacare.
We may not be the greatest generation, but we are the largest -- and we vote. We throw our weight around. What if we threw some of it in the right direction?

 BODY:
Imagine this chain of events: a division of a large multinational company is accused of a pattern of corporate misconduct that includes surveillance, hacking into phones and bribery of law enforcement officials.
Dozens of employees are arrested over the course of a year, and seven are charged in one day with grievous criminal conduct. Add in that the company seeks to cover up its actions at every turn, in some cases reportedly bribing law enforcement officials, while some of its political opponents are singled out for surveillance and black ops. Let's further stipulate that the company may just be the most visible perpetrator in an industry that has lost its way.
It sounds improbable, like a John Grisham legal thriller about a corrupt law firm or a fast-and-loose brokerage house, but it actually happened at a newspaper company, of all things. Last week seven former executives at News International, the British newspaper division of News Corporation, including Andy Coulson and Rebekah Brooks, were charged in connection with the phone hacking investigation, after years of denials.
If this happened in any other industry -- the banking sector during the financial crisis, the oil companies after the BP spill, or Blackwater during the Iraq war -- you would expect to see a full-court press by journalists seeking to shine a light on a corrupt culture allowed to run amok. 
Now would seem to be journalism's big moment to turn that light on itself, with deeply reported investigative articles about how things went so wrong: the failures of leadership, the skewed values and the willingness of an industry to treat the public with such contempt. The Guardian correctly suggested that the arrests were unprecedented in the history of newspapers.
But because it is the news business and the company in the sights is News Corporation, the offenders are seen as outliers. The hacking scandal has mostly been treated as a malady confined to an island, rather than a signature event in a rugged stretch for journalism worldwide. Collectively, the press in the United States put more time and effort into pulling back the blankets on the indiscretions of Herman Cain.
But journalism's ills don't live exclusively on Fleet Street or stop at British shores. While American newspapers don't publish in the hypercompetitive landscape that played a role in the tabloid excesses in Britain, the growing ecosystem of Web and cable news shares many of the same characteristics and, all too often, its failings. Economic pressures have increased the urgency to make news and drive traffic, even as budgets have been cut and experienced news professionals tossed overboard.
There is no accusation here of a broad, corporate-sanctioned effort to break the law in pursuit of the news. But the pratfalls have been tough to miss, including fundamental lapses in ethics: Casey Anthony, accused of killing her 2-year-old daughter, was acquitted of that offense in spite of significant evidence. When it was revealed that ABC News paid for most of her legal defense, through payments for exclusive photos, very few eyebrows were raised.
The Wild West ethos that often prevails has led to some startling mistakes. After the Supreme Court health care ruling in June, Bloomberg News bragged that it had beat Reuters by 12 seconds in reporting the decision, but the public was less interested in who went first than the fact that both CNN and Fox News got it wrong. When speed is the priority, the truth can be run over in the rush. Not only was the Supreme Court ruling mauled in haste, but a Colorado Tea Party organization was falsely linked by ABC News to the deadly theater shooting in Aurora.
Emily Bell, a former editor at The Guardian and now a professor of journalism at Columbia, gives relatively high marks to the American press, but says that Web frenzy creates pressures on both the truth and the people seeking it.
''It is a similar situation to the U.K. with an overcrowded and overheated market and a great deal of pressure to be first,'' she said. ''The Web heightens that pressure here and in some cases, it hasn't always led to good reporting.''
Those who get it wrong spend a few days in the spanking machine and then it is back to business as usual, with very little thought as to why journalism keeps shooting itself and its readers in the foot -- even in an age when there is more information on hand than ever before.
We depend on the Web to serve as a self-cleaning oven, revealing bad reporting and mistakes of fact and then fixing those pixels to reflect the current truth. But the big industrial-strength pat-down is barely in sight when it comes to the business of journalism.
The news media often fail to turn the X-ray machine on themselves because, in part, journalists assign a nobility to the profession that obscures the flaws within it. We think of ourselves as doing the People's work, and write off lapses in ethics and practices as potholes on the way to a Greater Truth.
The public isn't buying. According to the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, in 1985, 34 percent of the respondents thought stories contained inaccuracies. As of 2011, that figure had almost doubled to 66 percent.
Ed Wasserman, a professor of journalism at Washington and Lee University, says he believes it is a mistake to draw a straight line between what has happened in Britain and troubles in the American press. But that doesn't mean that the news media are doing their job.
''I do think there's something specifically British in the hooliganism of News of the World and the other tabs there, including eavesdropping and petty bribery,'' he wrote in an e-mail. ''U.S. media corruption is different. In many respects it's far worse -- herding, cozying up to sources, constantly fleeing for the middle, and reading off a very narrow news agenda.''
(Lest we think that hacking can't happen here, last week a vivid reminder arrived: Michael Gallagher, a reporter who pleaded guilty in 1998 to hacking the internal phone system of Chiquita in pursuit of a story, went to court and successfully petitioned to have his criminal conviction expunged. It's like it never happened, except it did.)
For certain, it was good journalism -- by The Guardian most notably -- that revealed the scope of News International's transgressions in the first place. Some news outlets, including this one, have produced illuminating articles on both the scandal in Britain and journalism's lapses in general.
But the effort to get at the skewed culture at the core of the business has largely been missing. Now that the jig is up and criminal trials are scheduled, the reaction in much of the press has been underwhelming and defensive.
After Ms. Brooks and the others were charged last week, Chris Blackhurst, editor of the left-leaning Independent, worried about the chilling effect it might have on newspapers, and said there might be instances when journalism needed to operate outside the law. ''The Independent hasn't hacked anyone's phone, but there might be a case where we felt that we had to,'' he said at the time.
When I read all the keening about how this might upend the entire industry in Britain, forcing a fundamental change in the business, I had one clear reaction: good.
Part of the reason the public has lost confidence in our product is that it sometimes does not merit it. If journalism is losing its way, that's a story that needs to be told over and over.

HEADLINE: Campaigns Take Different Roads Against Olympics

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Can politics compete with gymnastics?
The week ahead may be one of the most challenging for the message mavens of the presidential campaigns as they try to break through Olympic fever.
That fever may not subside until Friday, when the monthly jobs report may once again remind Americans of the sober economic realities they face.
But until then, President Obama and Mitt Romney are trying different approaches as they seek the attention of a voting public that is more focused on the sport of sports than the sport of politics. Here is a look at the week ahead for the candidates, as well as what effect the jobs report could have: 
OBAMA The president's team is trying the traditional approach: television commercials and visits to swing states.
On Wednesday and Thursday, Mr. Obama will make campaign stops in Ohio, Florida and Virginia. The message he delivers will most likely be the same as it has been: a combination of attacks on Mr. Romney and a defense of his tenure in the White House.
His television advertisements will echo those messages. The campaign is running a commercial that features Mr. Obama talking about America being a country of ''workers and doers and dreamers.'' In the ad, the president says he believes in ''fighting for the middle class, because if they are prospering, all of us will prosper.''
The campaign is also running an ad accusing Mr. Romney of opposing insurance coverage for contraception, wanting to overturn Roe v. Wade and supporting a law that would have banned abortion, even in cases of rape and incest (a charge that Mr. Romney's campaign heatedly denies).
''We need to attack our problems, not a woman's choice,'' a woman says at the end of the commercial.
ROMNEY Mr. Romney will take a different approach, having chosen to spend the first half of the week in Europe on a trip meeting foreign leaders. That leaves the domestic conversation to Mr. Romney's surrogates and his campaign commercials.
On Sunday, Mr. Romney delivered remarks in Israel, pledging to respect that country's right to take pre-emptive action against Iran. On Tuesday, he will speak in Poland after two days of discussions there.
In the meantime, Mr. Romney has run an ad accusing the president of disrespecting small businesses. (Mr. Obama and his allies say his remarks are being taken out of context.) In the commercial, the owner of a small business asks Mr. Obama, ''Why are you demonizing us?''
Mr. Romney's campaign is trying to push that message even while he is abroad. The campaign's surrogates have held dozens of ''We did build it!'' events around the country to try to highlight the president's remarks.
JOBS REPORT Perhaps nothing either candidate does will compete with the London Olympics quite as effectively as the jobs report that will be released at 8:30 a.m. on Friday.
The monthly data will show how many jobs were added or lost in July and whether the unemployment rate has changed from 8.2 percent. Most economists do not expect a major change in either direction.
If that expectation proves true, Mr. Romney -- who will return from Europe by the end of the week -- is certain to seize on the weak job growth numbers as further evidence that Mr. Obama's policies are not working. The president's schedule says only that he has meetings at the White House that day, leaving him plenty of opportunity to respond.
The Olympics will continue until Aug. 12, and many American voters may decide they will not tune in to the presidential campaign until the Games are over.
And then? Watch out. Mr. Romney will probably pick his vice-presidential nominee soon after. And the national party conventions -- another type of spectator sport -- will start at the end of August.

HEADLINE: Bill Clinton to Have Leading Role at Party's Convention

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Former President Bill Clinton is set to play a central part in the Democratic convention, aides said, and will formally place President Obama's name into nomination by delivering a prime-time speech designed to present a forceful economic argument for why Mr. Obama deserves to win a second term.
The prominent role of Mr. Clinton, which is scheduled to be announced on Monday, signals an effort by the Obama campaign to pull out all the stops to rally Democrats when they gather for their party's national convention in Charlotte, N.C. An even more important audience will be the voters across the country who will see the address carried by television networks. 
''There isn't anybody on the planet who has a greater perspective on not just the last four years, but the last two decades, than Bill Clinton,'' David Axelrod, a top strategist to the Obama campaign, said in an interview on Sunday. ''He can really articulate the choice that is before people.''
Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will appear on the final night of the convention, making the case for Mr. Obama before the largest audience of the week during an outdoor speech at the Bank of America Stadium. The vice president and Mr. Obama will appear together on stage before they accept the party's nomination for a second term in the White House.
It is unusual in recent election cycles, although not without precedent, for the vice president not to get the stage to himself during a night at the convention. But in his speech, aides said, Mr. Biden is expected to remind Americans about the last four years and the administration's accomplishments in a difficult economic climate.
The invitation for Mr. Clinton to be center stage at the convention signifies another milestone in the complicated and evolving relationship between the two presidents.
At the party's convention in Denver four years ago, all eyes were on Mr. Clinton as he offered a full-throated endorsement of Mr. Obama in a speech that served as something of a truce after a contentious primary fight with his wife.
For Mr. Clinton, who has become one of the most popular figures in the Democratic Party, the speech will be among the most high-profile roles yet that he has assumed for Mr. Obama. The address is intended to offer a strong contrast with the Republican ticket and will be closely watched, particularly given a string of blunt statements -- and retractions -- that Mr. Clinton has made this year when talking about the Obama administration.
For example, Mr. Clinton called for temporarily extending all of the tax cuts set to expire at the end of the year, including the Bush-era rates, which put him at odds with the president. He later apologized for those comments, but not before the Republican National Committee seized on the controversy.
Cheney on '08 Palin Choice
Dick Cheney said on Sunday that Sarah Palin was not ready in 2008 to be his successor as vice president and that Senator John McCain's decision was ''a mistake'' that Mitt Romney should seek to avoid making in his own choice of running mate.
Speaking to ABC News in his first interview since undergoing a heart transplant in March, Mr. Cheney said Mr. McCain's choice clearly reflected considerations other than Ms. Palin's ability to serve as vice president.
Asked whether a presidential candidate should consider how well a vice-presidential nominee might appeal in a particular state or to a demographic group, Mr. Cheney said, ''Those are important issues, but they should never be allowed to override that first proposition.''

HEADLINE: How to Cut Skilled-Labor Costs

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: Outsourcing of jobs is spreading to many fields, including those with higher wages, putting ever more pressure on the job market for recent college graduates, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
To import or to outsource? That is the question. Recent discussions of expanding access to H1-B visas highlight the tensions between employers in the United States in search of highly skilled employees and highly educated American citizens who face increasingly stiff competition in the global labor market. 
Much of the discussion about expanding H1-B visas focuses on whether there are particular areas of "skill shortage" despite persistently high unemployment. 
The more fundamental question is how much American employers can cut their costs either by importing highly skilled workers or exporting highly skilled jobs. 
The answer is, a lot.

Since the 1990s, the global supply of skilled labor has greatly expanded and the technology for using this labor wherever it is has greatly improved. Why hire a more expensive employee when a cheaper one is available? Why pay taxes to educate and train highly skilled workers when other countries (and their families and taxpayers) will do that for you? 
The disruptive impacts of globalization initially hammered workers without much education. Many workers holding college degrees remained optimistic about the benefits of international trade, celebrating improvements in their own purchasing power. 
Now, my students can decide for themselves if lower prices will compensate them for reduced opportunities and lower wages. More than half of recent college graduates in the United States are either unemployed or are working in a job that doesn't require a bachelor's degree. Entry-level wages for employed college graduates were lower in 2011 than in 2000. 
The current global recession isn't the only cause. The economist Richard Freeman provides an extraordinarily clear account of what he calls "The Great Doubling" of labor supply resulting from structural changes that brought China and India more directly into the global marketplace. 
Rather than relying merely on low-wage competition, China and India, like many developing countries, invested heavily in higher education and scientific training. While college graduates represent a small occupational elite within their large labor force, their absolute numbers are high compared with those homegrown in the United States. 
College students in the United States who major in science, technology, engineering and mathematics - often referred to as STEM fields - definitely face better prospects in the labor market than others do. But even they need to be aware of intensified competition down the road.
Many software engineers and others in the information technology field feel particularly aggrieved about the effects of the H1-B visa program. The computer scientist Norman Matloff, who maintains a Web site on the topic, asserts that it enables employers to hire younger and less expensive workers, leaving many highly skilled, older programmers in the lurch. 
Workers with H1-B visas have a strong incentive to remain with the employer for whom it was issued in order to obtain a green card, allowing permanent residence in the United States, in a timely fashion. As a result, they have relatively little bargaining power. 
Professor Matloff, who favors extensive changes to the H1-B visa program, also warns of the growing impact of outsourcing on jobs for computer science majors. Further, he observes that high-tech companies insisting that there is a shortage of STEM workers with advanced degrees in the United States don't seem willing to invest much in increased financial support for graduate education. 
Maybe college students should seek jobs that seem less vulnerable to global competition, in fields like health sciences. But I just read an article about health care companies sending jobs overseas that gave me palpitations. 
The economist Alan Blinder asserts that high educational requirements can make a job more rather than less "offshorable." Most large American companies have already figured this out - but it's not clear how many college students have. 
I hate to be the one to break the news.

HEADLINE: This Week In Small Business: Pet Supplies!

BYLINE: GENE MARKS


HIGHLIGHT: Plus: the economy loses momentum, the recession claims 170,000 small businesses, and the you-didn't-build-that debate. 

 BODY:
What's affecting me, my clients and other small-business owners this week.
The Big Story: Things Are Tough
More than a third of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck, poverty is on track to be the highest since the 1960s and 75 percent of people at retirement age have accumulated less than $30,000 in savings. The global economy is reportedly in its worst shape since 2009 and the current drought here could cause global unrest. The recession claimed 170,000 small businesses in two years, and Andrew Sullivan wonders if Malcolm Gladwell caused it. A professor of economics at the University of Missouri-Kansas City who is also a senior scholar at New York's Levy Economics Institute of Bard College says thieves have taken over the financial system. Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers feel that the economic policy debate is a sham (and one side is to blame). McDonald's reports slower sales. Cisco cuts 1,300 jobs. This is not what Ben S. Bernanke predicted five years ago. Even Tony Robbinsis feeling the heat!
The Data: The Energy Stimulus
The economy seems to be losing the momentum it had. Manufacturing activity in both the Midwest (pdf) and the Central Atlantic regions remains tepid. A widely followed index indicates the weakest improvement in manufacturing conditions in 19 months, and new home sales dropped significantly. Durable goods orders, excluding transportation and defense, are down. Rail traffic slows. But a bright spot is the energy sector which delivers an economic stimulus of almost $1 billion every day. Remodelers are forecasting a positive outlook. Other than mortgage delinquencies, Russell Investments says economic indicators are in their typical range. And the sale of pet supplies defies the economy.
Starting Up: Disruption 
Alyson Shontell says these are the 11 most disruptive start-ups. Ben Horowitz explains why a tiny start-up was worth $1.26 billion. These four New York City start-ups are reshaping small business. Rieva Lesonsky writes about taking your start-up global. Lauren Drell reports on what founders wish they knew before they started. A crowd-funding company introduces a Facebook game in which real start-ups like AirBnB, Etsy, and Pinterest compete for a player's virtual investment. Tech start-ups are making millions off the presidential campaign. A maker of workplace collaboration tools raises $28 million. Columbia University opens an entrepreneurship lab.
Management: Don't Be Batman
Did Jack Gilchrist build this? Dave Roberts says the "OODA Loop" helps managers make decisions and act on them using a four-stage model: observation, orientation, decision and action. Susan Payton says yoga teaches 10 things about small-business ownership. Two ways to cut costs in your business: don't be Batman and follow Arie Hefter's cost-cutting advice, including: "telecommuting can be a great way to both cut costs and, for the right workers, increase efficiency overall." Melanie Williams says there are eight signs of a cowardly leader. A consulting firm says these are 10 surefire ways to destroy your business. Here is how to find your next great business idea. Karl Stark and Bill Stewart suggest three ways to get more time. Jane Porter suggests nine routine tasks you should eliminate from your workday. Mike Michalowicz says there were five ways our colonial forebears kept stress at bay.
Your People: Say What You Pay
Experts advise that when a sexual harassment accusation flies you should investigate and discipline right away (this husband should be investigated for harassing his wife). Research shows that you should be open about what you pay your employees: "Remember what matters to your employees isn't that their pay be equal but that the system for awarding it seems fair." David Beckham surprises a few fans.
Marketing: The Circles
Angely Grecia shares eight networking tips for shy business owners, including "Stop checking your mobile every minute." Anne-Sophie Reinhardt teaches how an introvert can survive big conferences: "Remember the mantra: Nobody belongs here more than me." Andy Sernovitz reveals the biggest clue that will warn you that a conference is going to be awful. Scott Steinberg offers five high tech trends for small-business marketing. The last of Brad Smith's three easy ways to create customer loyalty is "content marketing," which he says is part art and part science. Sonia Simone wants you to protect your business's greatest asset: your audience. Seth Godin explains the circles of marketing (it's about more than just hype).
Social Media: Hard Truths
Here's how to get Google to index your new Web site and blog quickly. Tim Berry tells Jim Blasingame how to integrate social media into a business plan. Twenty transaction marketing players are vying to create "a synergistic mash of loyalty programs, offers, reputation management and the 'big data' sets that can analyze behavior and target specific customers." Twitter goes down (again). Jeff Bullas shares 72 social media facts for 2012. Whitney Hoffman suggests 10 social media hard truths (it's no longer a fad). Ashley Neal talks about going local with her small-business blogging. Small businessesare embracing F-Commerce.
Around The Country: Are Contests Worth It?
Voting ends next week for the top small-business influencers. Frontier Communications introduces a social media all-star contest for small businesses. Jason Keith wonders if small-business contests are a waste of time or worth the money. A Boston-based nonprofit is expanding its programming with a "StreetWise MBA" course in October. A California city deals with the aftermath of bankruptcy. The heat wave takes its toll on small businesses. A new travel community helps entrepreneurs avoid expensive hotels. These 11 metropolitan areas have more than 100,000 small businesses and these cities have bigger economies than entire countries.
Around The World: China's Perfect Storm
Economists say Europe is sleepwalking toward disaster. Germany faces its own recession. Amid the mayor's Olympic welcome, Amazon makes a big expansion and offers a tuition benefit aimed at its lowest-paid employees (and Jeff Bezos supports gay marriage). But Britain remains in recession. China's manufacturing contracts at a slower pace, and Steve Sherfy believes the country is undergoing a perfect storm of market growth. As costs rise in China, technology lures factories back to America. People in these countries have moved $21 trillion to offshore tax havens. A cash-strapped Argentine town pays employees by raffle. Dina Kyriakidou reports on the lessons learned by a Greek shrimp farm. A South Korean man claims his dog gave birth to a cat.
Red Tape: The Price of Reform
The Congressional Budget Office reaffirms that health care reform will reduce the deficit -- but business owners may pay $4 billion more in taxes. A Deloitte study finds that one in 10 employers plan to drop health insurance. An Internet sales tax bill picks up speed in Congress and its supporters say it's good for consumers. Here's a helpful guide for using the federal business opportunities Web site. And if you're looking for a new accountant here are a few things to consider. An Internal Revenue Service watchdog concludes that small-business audits often find no more taxes due.
Technology: Wanna Hang Out?
Meghan Peters teaches how to host a Google+ hangout. Brian Lane explains how manufacturing is going mobile. "Skimmers" used to rob automated teller machines are getting thinner. Google announces the winners of its 2012 science fair and looks for partners to help build its cloud platform. George Crump says that one way to avoid cloud outages is to consider an "on-ramping solution." Celebrities explain what life will be like in the future and read mean tweets about themselves. Apple releases a new operating system. Small businesses dominate the mobile app market. Ramon Ray explains what Microsoft's purchase of Yammer means for small businesses. Microsoft's Cindy Bates suggests three ways around tough tech challenges.
Tweets of the Week
@larrywinget: You don't have a money problem, you have a priority problem. Get your priorities right and your money will get right.
@duncanbrodie: Things Not To Do When Managing: Assume that everyone is motivated by the same things as you
@TheEllenShow: What did the coach tell the runner who was afraid of hurdles? Get over it.
@cspenn: Remember the good old days when Twitter being down wasn't news?
The Week's Bests
Evangelos Simoudis says that we need to be more customer centric: "Companies that don't start planning on how to become customer centric and how to achieve this goal by integrating all their customer-related data and systems in order to provide a consistent and unified message across all their interaction channels will find themselves at a considerable disadvantage over the next five or so years."
Kyle Wiens won't hire people who use poor grammar: "Grammar signifies more than just a person's ability to remember high school English. I've found that people who make fewer mistakes on a grammar test also make fewer mistakes when they are doing something completely unrelated to writing - like stocking shelves or labeling parts. I hire people who care about those details. Applicants who don't think writing is important are likely to think lots of other (important) things also aren't important."
Jon Stow is not a fan of amateurism: "Even some businesses with Web sites don't utilize the domain for e-mail. An example would be reallywhizzyflorists.com advertising an e-mail address such as reallywhizzyflorists@yahoo.com It doesn't sit right. To quote John McEnroe 'You cannot be serious.'"

HIGHLIGHT: Will the slow-paced life -- and economy -- of rural New York remain a benefit to new business ventures, no matter how inventive and charming they may be? 

 BODY:
It's summer 2012. I'm sitting in a newly rehabbed building in Bloomville, N.Y., a town you've most likely never heard of. A beautiful young woman, Inez Valk-Kempthorne, is telling me how she began life in the Netherlands, made her way to New York, worked as a model, met and married Justus Kempthorne, a boy from Tennessee, visited friends in Bovina (a metropolis down the road), bought property, built a house of post-and-beam (Justus is a carpenter), fell in love with a building at a town crossroads, bought it, renovated it, and in early July opened Table On Ten (Route 10, that is).
Seventeen years ago, in 1995, I heard that there was a cafe about to open in Bovina. , I said to my wife, and so we drove through a landscape of incredible beauty and arrived at a building that seemed to have been transported from another world. Inside were counters and shelves filled with delicacies one might find at Balducci's. Polished wood floors, attractive hanging lights, a music system playing Chet Baker (a favorite of mine) and, in charge, a beautiful woman (there's a pattern here) who welcomed us as if we had always been her best friends. That was Carol Spinelli, who along with her husband, Dave Jalkower, was a refugee from the fast-paced world of the New York garment industry. You can take the girl out of New York, but you can't take the New York energy out of the girl, and that energy was poured by Carol and Dave into a magic place called Main Street Bovina. It changed everything.

Now in 2012, Main Street Bovina is long gone, but just last week in the same building the old magic was felt again at the opening of Two Old Tarts. The tarts are partners John Schulman and Scott Finley. John was a fashion retailer and designer. Scott was the manager of a direct-mail marketing firm who, after visiting his brother, moved up here, where he cleaned houses, sold houses, waited tables, met John and baked - for years at a local farmer's market, and now in this new-old venue, which has only been on the planning boards since January. The opening was rushed so that it could coincide with Bovina Day, not yet a national holiday. Continuity is provided by Shirley Dammenhayn, who was there on the first day to help out at Main Street Bovina in 1995 and is here on the first day again.
John and Scott live in Andes (the chic town in these parts), and in Andes a couple from Bovina, Peter Mullin and Victoria Charkut, have just opened Buttercup, a restaurant named after a cat who hated going back to the city. Mullin and Charkut took the hint and now they are here to stay. Mullin was formerly in finance and computer sales. Charkut was an actress who also writes, or will again when the burden of running a restaurant is relaxed and she has some time. Right now she and her husband are learning everything, and she takes comfort and insight from the realization that, as she puts it, starting a restaurant is very much like putting on a new show. Their theatrical venture stars the chef Chris McGee, another refugee from the city who moved up here without a job or prospects after stints at a bunch of stellar New York restaurants. He answered an ad and is enamored of the freedom he now enjoys in a small boutique setting. He especially likes the fact that he can walk out into the fields of farmers who are his friends and pick out what he wants to serve that day.
The three new establishments are different in look and feel, but they share a dedication to local ingredients. At Table On Ten, nearly everything you eat will have been harvested in a 10-mile radius. At Two Old Tarts, the pastries the customers devour - and devour is the right word - have just been prepared by the proprietors. At Buttercup, Mullin and Charkut are as surprised as anyone else by the delights McGee has created for the day.
There is also a shared commitment to being more than a commercial enterprise. Inez Valk-Kempthorne told me that she doesn't welcome people into "my" restaurant, but into everyone's community center. Soon she will have a pizza oven and stage movie nights. She invites groups and organizations to utilize the space. She invites guest chefs to try things out.
Charkut is thinking of staging play and poetry readings in the winter months when everything slows down and people need something to draw them out of their houses. Two Old Tarts is already (after only a week) a place where people expect to find their friends sitting at the next table.
This is all unfolding under the shadow of a perennial but unconfirmed rumor that a high-end resort will be built on a large plot of land that sits in three towns, including Andes and Bovina. It is anybody's guess as to what will happen if this rumor ever pans out, and the people I talk to regard the prospect with a mixture of anticipation and apprehension. , Charkut pleads. , Valk-Kempthorne tells me. For many who live here, the beauty of the area is enhanced, not spoiled, by the fact that the landscape is not manicured. The extraordinary energy one feels in the air and in these new restaurants goes hand in hand with a determination to live the slow-paced life. Is there such a thing as slow-down energy (Buttercup's building used to house The Slow-Down Caf)? What will happen to these heady ventures when the flush of early success gives way to the harsh realities of the upstate economy? Will they figure it out? Stay tuned.

HEADLINE: Behind the Cover Story: Suzy Hansen on Improving Health in Mississippi, the Iran Way

BYLINE: RACHEL NOLAN


HIGHLIGHT: The author of this week's cover article answers questions on the uphill battle of preventive medicine, what health workers have learned from Iran, and how poverty in Mississippi is not what you'd expect. 

 BODY:
. Hansen's last article for the magazine was on Istanbul's art scene. 
How did you first hear about this program in Mississippi?
A year ago, a friend sent me a link to a short story about it in AARP magazine. I thought that it could be a deeper story - about why this doctor, Aaron Shirley, after decades of working on health care for the poor, would turn to a health care model from a country less developed and with fewer resources than the United States. And what does the idea itself - especially the fact that it's so basic - tell us about the state of American health care?
You write that this part of the U.S., the Mississippi Delta, doesn't look terribly poor on first glance. What else surprised you when you got there? 
I think Claudia Cox, a nurse I wrote about in the article, said it the best: poverty "used to be bare feet, now it's Nikes." When you hear how poor people are in Mississippi, there's a part of you that expects to see incredibly dramatic scenes. And they certainly exist. But there was another layer of poverty in Mississippi that was more surprising to me. I live in Turkey, and there the poor don't have possessions. You walk into an apartment or a house and sense the deprivation immediately. Poor Americans, on the other hand, often have stuff. But that doesn't mean they aren't terribly poor. That doesn't mean they aren't hanging on by a thread, drowning in debt, or unable to get adequate health care.
Because places with widespread health problems can correlate with high unemployment, how easy is it to staff the health services you write about once they are financed
There aren't enough trained people for these jobs in poor states like Mississippi. Dr. Shirley said there are lots of nursing positions that need to be filled in the state. It's hard to keep doctors and nurses and well-trained people there. But I think it also raises the questions of why all these unemployed people aren't getting the education, seeking the education, staying in school, finding these opportunities or getting help to find them.
Did the people you spoke with in Mississippi talk about the Affordable Care Act at all?
Not very much. Doctors and political types were talking about it, and many are outraged about opposition to the Affordable Care Act in the state. But the sick people I interviewed didn't bring it up. They're mostly just trying to get through today and tomorrow and deal with the circumstances they have. They did express a sense of being left behind, though they never blamed anyone for that.
Are the sick people you interviewed aware that the idea for the program originated in Iran?
No, I don't think they know, and I doubt they'd care. Obviously some politicians would find the Iran connection more distasteful than others. At one point during the process of setting it up, Mississippi's former governor Haley Barbour declared Iran the world's No. 1 threat. That's the climate.
And yet Iranians who came to Mississippi were shocked at the deficiencies of the U.S. health care system?
I think they were surprised by the level of poverty, just as I was, and as many people probably would be. But American poverty can come as more of a surprise to foreigners who think of America as the land of opportunity and prosperity.
Are there any plans to scale up and take the program to other places?
It may be possible to replicate aspects of the Iranian model in Mississippi, but if they can't integrate health houses with hospitals, then their version will always lack a kind of efficiency and continuity of care.
You write that a lot of money pours into the Mississippi, and the delta is studied and studied, but nothing changes. Where does all that money go? 
That's somewhat of a mystery. One of the problems with research is that eventually the researchers pack up and leave. It's the problem of sustainability. Another person expressed it to me as a problem of disconnectedness. There are so many competing groups who want money for different programs and initiatives, but are they working together to get at the heart of the problems? You might improve teen pregnancy rates in one town, but then what about diabetes? And even if you "fix" health care, how great can anyone's life be without good jobs? The problems are endless. There are also so many wonderful, devoted people working to change things in Mississippi. But you leave there feeling like the larger system just doesn't work.
What have reactions to your article been like?
People just keep writing about how sad they are about the situation in Mississippi. I also saw that one of the commenters remarked that he rarely reads positive articles about Muslim countries in the American press.

HEADLINE: Digital Notes: A Metal Label Makes Amends With Spotify

BYLINE: BEN SISARIO


HIGHLIGHT: Century Media Group, whose acts include Andrew W.K., Lacuna Coil and Krisiun, said it was reversing its stance and would license its music to the service. 

 BODY:
When Spotify came to the United States last year, not everyone in the music business was pleased with its economics. But slowly there has been a dtente.
From the beginning, some artists and record companies have worried that Spotify's royalty system, in which fractions of a penny are paid each time a song is streamed, would cannibalize more profitable download sales. Last year, Coldplay and Adele withheld their full albums, and some companies, like the independent metal label Century Media Group, pulled their catalogs entirely.
Announcing its decision least year, Century, whose acts include Andrew W.K., Lacuna Coil and Krisiun, said that Spotify's payment system "accelerates the downward spiral" of the music industry, "which eventually will lead to artists not being able to record music the way it should be recorded."
There are still some prominent holdouts, like the Black Keys. But lately more and more acts have been shaking hands with Spotify. Coldplay and Adele have both put their full albums up, and on Monday, Century said it was reversing its stance and would license its music to the service.
"We respect that music fans wanted to have instant access to our catalog via Spotify," Don Robertson, Century's president of North America, said a joint statement with Spotify. "But we also have to consider the rights of our artists. After practicing some due diligence, we're moving ahead confident that both the artist and the fan are being fairly served by this developing platform."
U.S. Indies Pressure Universal: A few days after the Universal Music Group made sweeping concessions in Europe as part of its $1.9 billion bid to take over EMI, an American group representing independent labels has called the Federal Trade Commission to block the deal on the grounds that no such remedies have been proposed in the United States.
The trade group, the American Association of Independent Music, or A2IM, has made brief statements opposing the merger. But on Monday its president, Rich Bengloff, condemned the deal in strong terms, noting that none of the $440 million in EMI divestments that Universal proposed to the European Commission were for assets in the United States:
With no divestitures or operating remedies proposed for the U.S. -- the world's largest music market and home to the vast majority of the technology companies who work with the music community -- the negative impact on music consumers and emerging technology companies is clear. Such market concentration will diminish healthy competition, providing one dominant market leader damaging clout in terms of both consumer pricing and the means with which music is made available. The effect on both promotional access and monetization for independent music labels and artists is equally clear.
Universal's proposed divestments represent about a quarter of EMI's annual revenue around the world and two-thirds of its sales in Europe. The European Commission must rule on the deal by Sept. 27; the Federal Trade Commission has given no indication when it would make its decision.

HEADLINE: HSBC Sets Aside $2 Billion for Legal Woes as Profit Falls

BYLINE: NEIL GOUGH


HIGHLIGHT: Profit at HSBC Holdings dropped nearly 9 percent in the first half of the year, as the big bank deals with the fallout from a money-laundering investigation and a settlement over selling inappropriate financial products. 

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- Profit at HSBC Holdings dropped nearly 9 percent in the first half of the year, as the big bank deals with the fallout from a money-laundering investigation and a settlement over selling inappropriate financial products. 
On Monday, HSBC said that it had set aside $700 million to cover the potential fines, settlements and other expenses related to a money-laundering inquiry in the United States. The bank made a further $1.3 billion provision toward a regulatory settlement related to payment protection plans for credit card loans, home mortgages and other consumer borrowings. 
The legal woes weighed on the company's financial results. 
 HSBC announced net income of $8.4 billion in the first half the year, down from $9.2 billion in the previous year. HSBC's operating income rose slightly, to $43.6 billion, over the same period.
"I very much regret HSBC's past failures and I apologize for them. Our controls should have been stronger and more effective," the British bank's chief executive, Stuart Gulliver, said Monday. '"We are committed to doing whatever it takes to make sure the organization is able to detect and prevent unacceptable behavior."
Even so, HSBC's final legal bills could rise. 
On Monday, Mr. Gulliver indicated there was "tremendous uncertainty" around the money-laundering case, and the "number could be significantly higher." He called the $700 million provision "a best estimate based on the facts that we currently know."
Earlier this year, the United States Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations issued a report accusing HSBC of serving as a conduit for money flowing illegally into the United States from Mexican drug traffickers and Middle Eastern banks with ties to terrorists. An outside audit identified nearly 25,000 transactions related to Iran involving more than $19 billion, which were handled by HSBC's American unit but were not properly disclosed to American regulators
HSBC has also been ensnared by the rate-manipulation inquiry, along with other big global bank. The multiyear investigation centers on benchmark rates, including the London interbank offered rate, Libor, and the Euro interbank offered rate, Euribor. 
Last month, Barclays paid $450 million to authorities for submitting false rates. Global banks may have to pay more than a combined $20 billion in fines and penalties related the investigation, according to estimates from analysts at Morgan Stanley.
HSBC said that it had made no provision for potential fines or regulatory settlements related to the global investigation. 
"It's far too soon to make any estimate on Libor or Euribor,'' Mr. Gulliver said. ''We are providing information to various regulators simply because we are a panel bank, and therefore we don't have any information that gives us any ability to make a provision for future costs that may result from anything do with Euribor or Libor.'"
Despite the continued legal problems, HSBC's underlying businesses are showing signs of strength. During the first three months through June 30, the bank reported that pretax profit rose 28.1 percent to $8.42 billion compared with same period a year earlier.
According to HSBC, Asia continued to be an ''absolute powerhouse'' for the bank's growth, accounting for half of pretax profit in the second quarter. Pretax earnings from Hong Kong and the rest of Asia rose 16 percent in the second quarter to $4.2 billion.
Since taking over as the bank's chief executive in January 2011, Mr. Gulliver has focused on cutting costs, selling less-profitable businesses and focusing new investment on faster-growing economies of Asia.
Over that time, HSBC announced more than 36 deals to reduce or dispose of its stakes in a wide range of businesses around the world. Last week, the bank struck an agreement to sell its 44 percent share in Global Payments Asia-Pacific, a card processing joint venture, for $242 million.
In August 2011, the bank announced a plan to slash 30,000 jobs by 2013, part of an effort to cut costs globally by $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion. On Monday, HSBC said the number of full time staff globally had fallen to 272,000 people in the second quarter, down 8 percent from 296,000 people a year earlier.

HEADLINE: A Trip to Poland, With an Eye on Swing States

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Polish-American voters make up large chunks of the electorate in several swing states that Mitt Romney must win if he wants to capture the White House in November. 

 BODY:
6:34 p.m. | Updated Mitt Romney's arrival in Poland on Monday provides an opportunity for the Republican candidate to embrace the ideals and values of one of America's closest allies in front of a global audience.
His campaign hopes they are watching in the Rust Belt.
Mr. Romney arrived in Gdansk for the start of two days of talks with Polish leaders, to be capped off by remarks from Warsaw on Tuesday. Aides have signaled that he will focus on the relationship between the two countries and strategic concerns about Russia.
But at home - where votes count - the trip's imagery may be more important than the specifics of Mr. Romney's policy pronouncements.
Polish voters make up large chunks of the electorate in several swing states that Mr. Romney must win if he wants to capture the White House in November. His campaign is clearly hoping that the high-profile visit this week will help woo those voters.
The two states with the largest number of Polish-Americans are out of reach for Mr. Romney: New York and Illinois, which together have close to two million Polish-Americans, will be firmly in the Democratic column in November. (The single biggest Polish-American population center? Chicago - President Obama's home town.)
But millions of Polish-Americans call Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin home. And those are three key states for Mr. Romney.
In some small towns in those three states, as many as half or more of the residents say they have Polish ancestry. Mr. Romney is hoping that a visit to Poland - and a warm embrace by Lech Walesa, the former Polish president - will help him capture a higher percentage of those voters.
Mr. Walesa, who has had a chilly relationship with Mr. Obama, effectively endorsed Mr. Romney during their meeting on Monday.
"I wish you to be successful because this success is needed to the United States, of course, but to Europe and the rest of the world, too," Mr. Walesa said to Mr. Romney during a photo-op after private discussions. "Governor Romney, get your success -- be successful!"
Mr. Romney is also hoping to capitalize on anger among some Poles toward Mr. Obama. In 2009, at the same time he was trying to 'reset' relations with Russia, the president canceled a missile defense system based partly in Poland, angering Warsaw, which felt abandoned in the face of pressure from Moscow. The administration denied that it was responding to Russian opposition and replaced the old missile defense program with a reformulated system that will also be partly based in Poland and has also generated opposition from Moscow.
And in May of this year, Mr. Obama offended some Poles and Polish-Americans by referring to "Polish death camps" instead of "Nazi death camps" during a ceremony at the White House.
Winning the Polish vote may not be that easy for Mr. Romney, however.
Polish-Americans do not vote in a block. A , which studies Polish-American affairs, found that 36 percent of Polish-Americans identified as Democrats. Thirty-three percent said they were independents. And just 26 percent said they were Republicans.
In a demographic survey in 2008 by the institute, 52 percent of Polish-Americans voted for Mr. Obama, while just 42 percent voted for Senator John McCain of Arizona.
However, the institute also noted that 44 percent of Polish-Americans say they are conservative. "It is not unreasonable to conclude that many Polish-American Democrats tend to be in the more conservative wing of the party," the group said.
Can Mr. Romney tap into some of those voters to win the Polish-American vote in November? And if he does, will it help him win some of those battleground states? 
In thelatest polls, Mr. Obama has been leading Mr. Romney in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. To win there, Mr. Romney will have to do more than just win over a few more Polish-Americans.
On the other hand, Mr. Romney's team knows that the contests in those states could easily narrow as election day nears, especially if the economy continues to struggle over the next several months.
In that case, every vote will count - something that Mr. Romney will no doubt be thinking of as he delivers his remarks in Warsaw on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Louisiana: Democrats in Registration Only

BYLINE: NICK CORASANITI


HIGHLIGHT: There are still more registered Democrats than Republicans in the state, but you wouldn't know it from the way they vote. 

 BODY:
When 26-year-old Walker Hines announced that he was switching his party affiliation to Republican from Democrat in 2010, he gave the Republican Party a majority in a Louisiana chamber for the first time since Reconstruction.
The young Mr. Hines's decision was emblematic of Louisiana's political transformation: it had become as red as its famous crawfish.
Much like its Gulf Coast brethren, Louisiana has flipped to a solid red state from a solid blue state over the past 20 years. The most recent FiveThirtyEight projections give Mitt Romney a 99.7 percent chance of carrying the state, and Republican presidential candidates have carried Louisiana easily since George W. Bush. In 2008, Louisiana was one of four Republican states in the country to vote more in favor of John McCain (58.6 percent) than Mr. Bush in 2004 (56.8 percent).
But while Louisiana votes consistently with the Deep South, its conservative engine is made up of slightly different parts, some of which, when viewed in isolation, falsely appears to make Louisiana more pink, or purple, than red.
Of the roughly 2.9 million registered voters in the state, 1.4 million are registered as Democrats, while about 789,000 are registered Republicans and another 694,000 registered as "other." Even if every "other" voter sided with the Republicans, it would appear that Louisiana is a hotly contested state. So how is every major state office held by a Republican?
The answer to the deceptive voter registration numbers lie, in part, with Louisiana's unique "jungle primary" system used in local, state and congressional elections, but not presidential elections. As in the presidential electoral system in France, all candidates for an office in Louisiana run at once without a separate party-specific primary. If any one candidate receives more than 50 percent of the vote, the election is over. If not, the top two face off in a runoff election a month later. Voters are not required to register with a party to participate in these elections, removing a main incentive for registering with either the Democrat or Republican parties.
"The minimal effort it takes to register with a party just isn't worth it in Louisiana," Mr. Parent said. "And a lot of older voters who once registered as Democrats, and I'm talking those 50 and over, now vote nearly exclusively Republican." 
In 2008, older voters showed up strong for Mr. McCain, with 65 percent of those in the 50-64 age range and 69 percent of those 65 and over casting a Republican ballot. 
The "jungle primary" system also has the potential to depress voter turnout, which in turn can lead to misleading exit polls and even some occasional surprise upsets. When voters are forced to return to the polls in the case of a runoff, many won't come back if the issues that had initially drawn them to the polls were already decided.
"Say there was a hotly contested congressional primary that was decided in the first election, and then a lot of local bills and state races went to a runoff, I don't think many people would be coming back out to the polls," Mr. Parent said. 
Electoral system aside, Louisiana became a Republican stronghold because of one main demographic that has shifted through the years: the Catholic vote.
Louisiana has a large Catholic population, setting it apart from its Gulf Coast neighbors. In the 2012 Republican primary, Catholics made up 36 percent of the voters in the primaries. While Catholics weren't tallied in Mississippi or Alabama exit polls in 2012, they accounted for only 8 percent in Mississippi and 5 percent in Alabama in 2008.
The Catholic vote is strongest in the predominantly Cajun southwestern part of the state known as Acadiana. Catholic voters once made up a large part of the "swing" vote in Louisiana, before social issues like abortion and same-sex marriage became part of the political conversation. In 1992, 41 percent of all voters in the state identified themselves as Catholics, and 47 percent of Catholics voted for Bill Clinton. By 2008, the vote had switched, with 70 percent of Catholics voting for Mr. McCain.
"Cajun Catholics are no longer moderately swing votes at all," Mr. Parent said. "They are becoming as reliably Republican as Southern Baptists."
However, this is not to say that the other regions of Louisiana hold no sway over elections. As FiveThirtyEight explained in its primary breakdown of Louisiana's political geography, the northern region of Louisiana is regarded as the most conservative region of the state, essentially behaving electorally as an extension of the states it borders: Arkansas to the north and Mississippi to the east. The southeastern part of the state tends to be evenly matched. While New Orleans and Baton Rouge are the state's Democratic strongholds, the surrounding suburbs are some of the most consistently Republican areas in the state.
The Bellwether: De Soto Parish
In the northwest corner of the state, south of Shreveport, De Soto Parish best reflects the current and continuing shift to the right of Louisiana. It has voted within three percentage points of the state margin in each of the last three presidential elections. It has a slightly larger black population (40 percent) than the state as a whole (32 percent), and with its proximity to Shreveport, has a blend of suburban Republican ideologies with Southern Baptist social conservatism.
The Bottom Line
Mr. Romney doesn't need to pick Gov. Bobby Jindal as a running mate to win Louisiana's eight electoral votes. The state will be called for the Republican candidate mere seconds after polls close on Nov. 6. Any Democratic hopes for winning the state disappeared in the 1990s.
And major disasters in the state have only kicked the Democrats further down. In response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, President Obama placed a moratorium on drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, which created a sense of resentment toward the president in Louisiana, said Mr. Mann, a professor of mass communication at L.S.U. 
"I don't hear anyone talk as bad about BP as they do about the moratorium," he said. "People in Louisiana, Democrats and Republicans, saw it as an intrusion into their way of life."
Where the oil spill brought resentment, Hurricane Katrina brought devastation. New Orleans lost 140,845 residents, a drop of 29 percent from 2000 to 2010. The majority of that loss can be attributed to the storm. The decrease in population was also a reason for Louisiana's losing a Congressional seat and an electoral vote in 2012.
"Katrina really did accelerate a lot of the changes that we have seen come about, like the Republican control of every statewide elected office," Mr. Mann said. "The shift to the right was already occurring, but Katrina may have been the tipping point."

HEADLINE: Romney's Charm Offensive

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: The campaign doesn't stop at the water's edge. 

 BODY:
It's now pretty much accepted that presidential campaigns are nasty, brutish and long, with no holds barred. But we-by which I mean the media and the D.C. establishment-still pay lip service to the idea that "politics stops at the water's edge." If the president's abroad, his challenger shouldn't attack him; and if the challenger's abroad, he shouldn't criticize U.S. policy. House Speaker John Boehner acknowledged this principle in March: "Clearly while the president is overseas," he said, "I think it's appropriate that people not be critical of him or our country."
But the rule often gets broken; politicians can't help themselves. Which brings me to Mr. Romney's ongoing adventures overseas.
Before leaving for England, one of Mr. Romney's aides questioned Mr. Obama's appreciation for the alliance between Washington and London. "We are part of an Anglo-Saxon heritage and [Mr. Romney] feels that the special relationship is special. The White House didn't fully appreciate the shared history we have," an unnamed adviser told The Telegraph.

Upon arrival in the Anglo-Saxon homeland, Mr. Romney said some silly things about the Olympics, which greatly annoyed some British politicians. Then he held a fundraiser in Mayfair.
From England, Mr. Romney traveled to Israel, where he waded into more dangerous territory. He accused Mr. Obama indirectly, but unmistakably, of wanting to "undermine" Israel and said he would "respect" any decision by Israel to attack Iran's nuclear weapons program. (And Mr. Obama would do what if Israel attacked Iran? Disrespect the decision?)
Mr. Romney had nothing of substance to say about what his actual policies would be if he were elected President, but that's hardly surprising.
Another non-surprise: Just like in London, he held a fundraiser, attended by high-profile donors including Sheldon Adelson, the casino magnate who bankrolled Newt Gingrich's hard-hitting attack on Mr. Romney before he started bankrolling Mr. Romney's hard-hitting attack on Mr. Obama. And at this fundraiser he suggested that Israelis are more economically successful than Palestinians because of cultural differences. (A senior aide to President Mahmoud Abbas had a different explanation: "this man doesn't realize that the Palestinian economy cannot reach its potential because there is an Israeli occupation.")
Mr. Adelson must be pleased with his investment so far. Not only did Mr. Romney rattle his saber on behalf of Israel, not only did he insult Palestinian culture in Mr. Adelson's presence, but he accomplished all of this Israel. It's a trifecta.
Next stop: Poland, where Mr. Romney will drag poor Ronald Reagan through yet another election. One of the candidate's foreign policy advisers, Ian Brzezinski, said the campaign wants to revive memories of "U.S. support of Poland as a captive nation during the Cold War" and Reagan's support of the Solidarity movement. Mr. Romney will also drag Mr. Obama through the mud, by suggesting he betrayed Poland when his administration scrapped plans for a European missile defense system.

HEADLINE: Meet the Undecided

BYLINE: LARRY M. BARTELS and LYNN VAVRECK


HIGHLIGHT: Who are the people who don't know whether they're voting for Obama or Romney in November? 

 BODY:
Most American voters have already decided whether they will pull the lever for Barack Obama or Mitt Romney in November. Their decisions were largely predictable even before Romney emerged as the Republican standard-bearer. But there are still a few people out there who are truly undecided - and if the race remains as close as it is now, their votes will be crucial to the outcome. Who are these people, and why do they seem to be having such a hard time making up their minds?
The one fact everyone seems to agree on is that there aren't many of them. Using its latest polling data, The Wall Street Journal writes that "American voters are growing more polarized and locked in their views." The Washington Post describes the election as "a settled issue for nearly nine in 10 voters." The race is "tight and stable," according to the Post's Ezra Klein, who adds that "Romney and Obama are realistically fighting over three or four percent of the electorate." And Paul Begala says "there are about as many people in San Jose as there are swing voters who will decide this election" - 916,643 people in six swing states, to be much too precise.
Typical opinion surveys do not include nearly enough respondents to provide a statistically reliable portrait of this narrow undecided sliver of the electorate. However, the Cooperative Campaign Analysis Project has been surveying 1,000 people each week since January, providing a much larger pool of respondents than any single survey can offer. By putting together the responses from 10 of these surveys conducted from May through July, we have assembled a mega-sample of 10,000 respondents interviewed after it became clear that Mitt Romney would be the Republican nominee. 
This mega-sample mirrors other recent polls in indicating a very close presidential race: among respondents who supported or leaned toward either major-party candidate, 51 percent chose Obama and 49 percent chose Romney. But crucially for our purposes, 592 of the 10,000 respondents (5 percent of the weighted sample) said they were not sure which presidential candidate they would vote for, then declined to express even a tentative toward Obama or Romney in response to a follow-up question. These people seem to be truly undecided - and there are enough of them to provide an unusually detailed and reliable picture of undecided voters in the country as a whole.
These 592 undecided voters differ from those who have made up their minds (or are at least leaning one way or the other) in some unsurprising ways. For example, they are rather less knowledgeable about politics, and much more likely to say they follow news and public affairs "only now and then" or "hardly at all." (Almost 40 percent are unsure which party currently has more members in the House of Representatives, and another 20 percent wrongly answered that it was the Democrats.) They are also considerably less likely to identify themselves as Republican or Democratic partisans, and less likely to call themselves liberals or conservatives (69 percent say they are moderates or not sure).
These differences may seem to confirm the common stereotype of undecided voters as "a group of people that have virtually no partisan or ideological attachments, pay very little attention to politics, and often create the crazy swings we see in the horse race polls," as Jay Cost of The Weekly Standard put it recently. But that stereotype turns out to be quite wrong in some important ways.
For example, despite the marked overrepresentation of independents among undecided voters, most undecided voters are not independents. The accompanying figure shows the distribution of party identification among our 592 undecided voters, as recorded in a C.C.A.P. baseline survey conducted with the same people in late 2011. Only three in ten were "pure" independents (those who denied leaning toward either party), while another 7 percent said they were not sure about their party identification. Four in ten were Democratic identifiers or leaners, while the remaining 23 percent were Republican identifiers or leaners.
The fact that more than half of the voters who are currently undecided began the campaign season thinking of themselves as Democrats or Republicans naturally raises the question of why they have - at least so far - resisted supporting their party's candidate.
Among Democrats, the most notable differences between the decided and the undecided are in their views about the president. For example, while 79 percent of decided and "leaning" Democrats approve of Obama's job performance and 65 percent say they like him a lot, the corresponding percentages among undecided Democrats are only 17 percent and 8 percent. 
Undecided Democrats' dissatisfaction with Obama does not seem to be focused on any one issue. While 52 percent say they disapprove of his overall performance, the disapproval rates for specific questions about how he has dealt with the budget deficit, the economy, immigration, gay rights, health care, Social Security, Medicare, taxes and abortion all range from 61 percent to 51 percent. 
Nor are their personal reservations about Obama focused on any one trait. The proportions who said they would "definitely " describe him as "effective," "inspiring," "honest," "strong," "sincere," or "patriotic" were each around 20 percent. Oddly, a larger fraction of undecided Democrats (30 percent) say they would definitely describe Obama as "experienced," despite the fact that he has already spent more than three years in the White House.
While undecided Democrats are clearly less than enthusiastic about Obama, there are indications that he could make some headway among them over the course of the next three months, especially if the economy shows some belated signs of further improvement. Only 18 percent of undecided Democrats disapprove of the president's performance; most say they "somewhat disapprove" (35 percent) or that they are not sure (30 percent). Presumably the third group, and perhaps the second as well, could be won over. Similarly, while only 3 percent of undecided Democrats currently say the national economy is getting better, 60 percent say it is "about the same" or that they are "not sure."
If most undecided Democrats are taking a "wait and see" attitude toward the economy between now and Election Day, they seem relatively unlikely to be won over by Romney in the meantime. Three-fifths have an unfavorable opinion of the challenger, with only one-fifth still unsure about him.
If undecided Democrats are focused on Obama and the economy, undecided Republicans seem to have already made up their minds on those scores. Seven in ten disapprove of the president's performance (45 percent strongly); only one-tenth say the economy is getting better, and even fewer say the country is "generally headed in the right direction." Clearly, these are people who should be inclined to support the challenger. However, 35 percent say they "dislike" Romney personally, and remarkably - remember, these are Republicans - only 1 percent say they "like him a lot." Moreover, 64 percent think Romney "says what he thinks people want to hear," while only 8 percent think he "says what he believes." (The corresponding percentages among other Republicans are 45 percent and 39 percent.) 
Much of this personal antipathy seems to have emerged over the course of the primary season. In the baseline survey in late 2011, only 18 percent of these same now-undecided Republicans said they disliked Romney, while 9 percent said they liked him a lot. Some of this antipathy may stem from the fact that undecided Republicans are also distinctly more moderate than those who have made up their minds. Only 45 percent call themselves "conservative" or "very conservative," while a similar number call themselves moderate or liberal. (The corresponding percentages among other Republicans are 73 percent and 23 percent.) 
Undecided Republicans are twice as likely as other Republicans to say they favor gay marriage (40 percent), twice as likely to express positive or neutral attitudes toward African-Americans (31 percent), and only half as likely to deny the existence of global warming (23 percent). Only 42 percent favor repealing Obamacare (compared with 78 percent of other Republicans). These are the sorts of Republicans most likely to have been alienated by Romney's dogged appeals to "the base" during the Republican primaries. Whether he can moderate his image enough to win them back without exacerbating the common complaint that he "says what he thinks people want to hear" remains to be seen.
Obviously, it is impossible to tell from our snapshot of the current views of these undecided voters where they will end up - with Obama, with Romney, or at home. Nevertheless, our portrait of who they are and what they are thinking at this point in the campaign may shed some light on the candidates' prospects in November. In particular, the fact that four of every ten currently undecided voters said before the campaign began that they identified with (or leaned toward) the Democratic Party probably bodes well for the president's chances. A Democratic skew also appears in undecided voters' reports of how they voted in 2008 (43 percent for Obama to 33 percent for McCain, with only 23 percent saying they didn't vote) and even in 2010 (23 percent for Democratic House candidates, 17 percent for Republicans). If they break similarly in 2012 - a big - the result may be to swing a seemingly "tight and stable" race narrowly in favor of the incumbent.

HEADLINE: Corn for Food, Not Fuel

BYLINE: By COLIN A. CARTER and HENRY I. MILLER. 
Colin A. Carter is a professor of agricultural and resource economics at the University of California, Davis. Henry I. Miller, a physician, is a fellow in scientific philosophy and public policy at the Hoover Institution.

 BODY:
IT is not often that a stroke of a pen can quickly undo the ravages of nature, but federal regulators now have an opportunity to do just that. Americans' food budgets will be hit hard by the ongoing Midwestern drought, the worst since 1956. Food bills will rise and many farmers will go bust.
An act of God, right? Well, the drought itself may be, but a human remedy for some of the fallout is at hand -- if only the federal authorities would act. By suspending renewable-fuel standards that were unwise from the start, the Environmental Protection Agency could divert vast amounts of corn from inefficient ethanol production back into the food chain, where market forces and common sense dictate it should go. 
The drought has now parched about 60 percent of the contiguous 48 states. As a result, global food prices are rising steeply. Corn futures prices on the Chicago exchange have risen about 60 percent since mid-June, hitting record levels, and other grains such as wheat and soybeans are also sharply higher. Livestock and dairy product prices will inevitably follow.
More than one-third of our corn crop is used to feed livestock. Another 13 percent is exported, much of it to feed livestock as well. Another 40 percent is used to produce ethanol. The remainder goes toward food and beverage production.
Previous droughts in the Midwest (most recently in 1988) also resulted in higher food prices, but misguided energy policies are magnifying the effects of the current one. Federal renewable-fuel standards require the blending of 13.2 billion gallons of corn ethanol with gasoline this year. This will require 4.7 billion bushels of corn, 40 percent of this year's crop.
Other countries seem to have a better grasp of market forces and common sense. Brazil, another large ethanol producer, uses sugar instead of corn to make ethanol. It has flexible policies that allow the market to determine whether sugar should be sold on the sugar market or be converted to fuel. Our government could learn from the Brazilian approach and direct the E.P.A. to waive a portion of the renewable-fuel standards, thereby directing corn back to the marketplace. Under the law, the E.P.A. would first have to determine that the program was causing economic harm. That's a no-brainer, given the effects of sharply higher grain prices that are already rippling through the economy.
The price of corn is a critical variable in the world food equation, and food markets are on edge because American corn supplies are plummeting. The combination of the drought and American ethanol policy will lead in many parts of the world to widespread inflation, more hunger, less food security, slower economic growth and political instability, especially in poor countries.
If the E.P.A. were to waive the rules for this year and next, the ethanol industry and corn farmers, who have experienced a years-long windfall, would lose out. Wheat and soybean farmers would also lose, because the prices of those crops have also been driven up: corn competes with soybeans for acreage and is substituted for wheat in some feed rations.
Any defense of the ethanol policy rests on fallacies, primarily these: that ethanol produced from corn makes the United States less dependent on fossil fuels; that ethanol lowers the price of gasoline; that an increase in the percentage of ethanol blended into gasoline increases the overall supply of gasoline; and that ethanol is environmentally friendly and lowers global carbon dioxide emissions.
The ethanol lobby promotes these claims, and many politicians seem intoxicated by them. Corn is indeed a renewable resource, but it has a far lower yield relative to the energy used to produce it than either biodiesel (such as soybean oil) or ethanol from other plants. Ethanol yields about 30 percent less energy per gallon than gasoline, so mileage drops off significantly. Finally, adding ethanol actually raises the price of blended fuel because it is more expensive to transport and handle than gasoline.
As the summer drags on, the drought is only worsening. Last week the International Grains Council lowered its estimate of this year's American corn harvest to 11.8 billion bushels from 13.8 billion. Reducing the renewable-fuel standard by a mere 20 percent -- equivalent to about a billion bushels of corn -- would offset nearly half of the expected crop loss due to the drought.
All it would take is the stroke of a pen -- and, of course, the savvy and the will to do the right thing.

HEADLINE: Medical Collector to Pay a $2.5 Million Settlement

BYLINE: By JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG

 BODY:
Accretive Health, one of the nation's largest collectors of medical debt, has agreed to pay $2.5 million to the Minnesota state attorney general's office to settle accusations that it violated a federal law requiring hospitals to provide emergency care, even if patients cannot afford to pay.
The company has not admitted wrongdoing. 
As part of Monday's settlement, Accretive Health is also barred from contracting with hospitals within the state for at least two years, effectively ending its business at three Minnesota hospitals. For four years after that, the company will have to obtain permission from the attorney general before resuming business in the state.
In April, Lori Swanson, the Minnesota attorney general, disclosed hundreds of Accretive's internal documents that outlined aggressive collection tactics, including embedding debt collectors in emergency rooms and pressuring patients to pay before receiving treatment.
Carol Wall, a 53-year-old Minnesota resident, said ''a woman with a computer cart'' told her she owed $300 as she was ''vaginally hemorrhaging large amounts of blood'' at an Accretive-affiliated emergency room in January, according to court records.
Another patient, Terry Mackel, 50, said he was asked to pay $363.55 at another Accretive-affiliated emergency room in Minnesota as he waited ''alone, groggy and hooked up to an IV'' waiting to see an emergency room doctor, according to court documents. Fearing that it was the only way to see a doctor, both patients paid.
Accretive Health declined to comment about Ms. Wall and Mr. Mackel. ''The conduct described by these patients is directly contrary to Accretive Health's policies, practices and training,'' Accretive said in a statement.
In an interview Monday, Ms. Swanson said ''a hospital emergency room should be a sanctuary for the sick and wounded, not a hunting ground for collectors.'' The settlement will end a civil suit against Accretive, which Ms. Swanson filed in January after a laptop with patient information was stolen, saying that the company had violated state and federal debt collection laws and patient privacy protections.
''Even though we believe the claims against us were either baseless or exaggerated, we have used this opportunity to carefully examine our own practices in order to ensure we are setting the very highest standards for our own performance and achieving the best possible outcomes for hospitals, patients and communities,'' Mary Tolan, Accretive Health's chief executive, said in a statement.
The revelations in Minnesota have reverberated across the country because they raise concerns that such aggressive tactics have become widespread at hospitals. Accretive Health contracts with some of the largest hospital systems in the country to help them recoup money on unpaid bills that have piled up during the financial crisis and the economic downturn.
Regulators in Illinois, where Accretive is based, have been watching the developments closely, according to Sue Hofer, a spokeswoman with the state Department of Financial and Professional Regulation.
Pete Stark, the Democrat of California who is the highest ranking member of the House subcommittee that oversees Medicare and other health services, led an investigation in March into the company's practices.
Hospitals have long hired outside collection agencies to pursue patients after they have received care. But mounting financial pressures have resulted in hospitals letting collection firms in the front door, turning over the management of their staffing, like patient registration and scheduling, along with their collection activities, according to Ms. Swanson.
Concerns are escalating that such cozy relationships will threaten patient privacy and care, according to consumer advocates.
Still, hospitals say that they are in a tough position. The more than 5,000 community hospitals in the United States provided $39.3 billion in uncompensated care -- made up of unpaid patient debts or charity care -- in 2010, up 16 percent from 2007, the American Hospital Association, a trade group, said.
Accretive Health e-mails and internal training manuals, which came to light through the investigation, revealed that some Accretive employees were told to hound patients to pay outstanding bills and sometimes discouraged them from receiving care.
The company fostered a pressurized collection environment, according to interviews with current and former employees. Those employees who fell behind collection quotas were threatened with termination.
''We've started firing people that aren't getting with the program,'' a member of Accretive's staff wrote in an e-mail to his bosses in September 2010.
In some instances, the employees had access to a trove of confidential patient records, which they might have used while persuading patients to pay their overdue bills, a potential violation of federal privacy laws. Under the terms of the settlement, Accretive Health will be required to turn over all the data of Minnesota patients that it has collected.
Shares of Accretive Health closed Monday before the settlement was announced at $10.01, down 4 percent. Since Ms. Swanson released the internal documents in April, shares of Accretive have plummeted by 46 percent. Investors late Monday afternoon seemed happy to see the suit and investigation resolved, sending the shares up 23 percent in after-hours trading.

HEADLINE: Muni Rates Examined For Signs Of Rigging

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL POPPER; Mary Williams Walsh contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Yet another key benchmark in the financial industry is under scrutiny.
Attention has swung to a set of benchmark interest rates that help determine how much cities and states pay to borrow money in the bond market. The scrutiny of the Municipal Market Data, or M.M.D. index, comes on the heels of revelations that a broader financial industry benchmark, the London Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor, was manipulated by banks before and after the financial crisis. Libor is used to help determine the costs of products like mortgages and credit cards.
Thomson Reuters, which owns Municipal Market Data, said on Monday that it ''has been involved in discussions with regulators'' about the rates, which influence the prices of bonds and derivatives in the $3 trillion municipal bond market. 
The company released the statement after the municipal bond industry's self-regulator, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, said that its board was ''concerned about the transparency'' behind the creation of a few indexes used to set prices in the municipal bond market, the most important of which is the M.M.D. index.
The M.M.D. rates influence a much smaller market than Libor, but it is one that is crucial to how cities and states across America borrow money to maintain roads and bridges and provide essential services such as public education.
The rates are compiled and issued each afternoon by Thomson Reuters using a proprietary method that includes input from banks that buy and sell municipal bonds, industry participants said, though Thomson Reuters does not publicly explain its method.
Christopher Taylor, the executive director of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board until 2007, said that during his years at the agency he heard frequent complaints that the opaqueness of the M.M.D. rates allowed them to be ''manipulated'' by banks that hold many municipal bonds.
''The feeling was that there were games being played with this,'' said Mr. Taylor.
Since regulators in June accused Barclays of trying to rig Libor, lawmakers and government agencies have been taking a broader look at other benchmarks that the financial industry could influence for its own benefit. In Europe, regulators are investigating whether banks artificially moved the Euro Interbank Offered Rate, or Euribor.
The scrutiny of the M.M.D. rates comes as a number of other events are drawing attention to the transparency and fairness of the municipal bond market. On Monday, three former bankers at UBS went on trial in Manhattan on charges that they had colluded to steer municipal bond transactions to specific banks in exchange for kickbacks.
Separately, the Securities and Exchange Commission will release a lengthy report soon that recommends reforms for the municipal bond market so that investors are put on a more even footing. Municipal bonds are popular among retail investors because the interest paid on them is exempt from federal taxes. But the market is largely controlled by big financial institutions that have resisted providing customers with information about how bonds are priced.
The S.E.C. report is also set to question the transparency surrounding the M.M.D. rates, according to a person who has seen the report but was not authorized to speak about it publicly.
Municipal Market Data was founded in the 1980s to provide data about a corner of the bond market where finding basic prices has been difficult in part because the securities were thinly traded. The company's most popular and influential product is an index that it issues each day that shows the going price for high quality AAA municipal bonds.
Banks use the previous day's rates as a guide to set the price of new bonds they are issuing on behalf of cities and states. A bank, for instance, may say that bonds being issued by the State of New York are expected to pay an interest rate of M.M.D. plus 50 basis points, or a half percent. The ultimate interest rate paid by a municipal bond is generally set through an auction as the banks issuing the bonds line up investors to buy the securities.
The index has also become more important in pricing financial contracts, known as swaps, that municipalities enter into with banks to manage the risks associated with changing interest rates. These arrangements mean that a movement in the M.M.D. index could hurt a municipality and help its banker, or vice versa.
David J. Madigan, who once worked at M.M.D., said that the company had tried to caution financial institutions not to use the index as an exact measure of municipal bond prices.
''It wasn't supposed to be the base for prices,'' said Mr. Madigan, now the chief investment officer at Breckinridge Capital Advisors.
Mr. Madigan said that M.M.D. published the rates to clients each day after talking with big banks about the prices they paid for particular munis. Using these sorts of conversations made the rates vulnerable to manipulation by the banks that M.M.D. consults, according to Mr. Madigan and other market watchers.
The broader criticism of M.M.D. within the industry is that there is little information on how it is calculated and as a result, little way to determine if it is accurate. A competitor to M.M.D., Municipal Market Advisors, sent a note last week to other players stating ''the lack of transparency of current, widely used municipal benchmarks provided by Thomson Reuters has caused the S.E.C. some concern and we expect the agency to bring those concerns to light in a forthcoming report.''
Municipal Market Advisors has an index that it has positioned as a competitor to the M.M.D. Alan D. Polsky, the chairman of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, said it was planning to look into how both companies set their rates.
Mr. Polsky said the board had not previously been aware of potential problems with the rates. He added that it did not have the authority to demand changes in how the indexes were calculated because they were created by private companies. He said he hopes to produce material helping investors to understand the rates, and said that if there were broader problems, they would be referred to the S.E.C.

HEADLINE: Battle on Spending Cuts Moves to Campaign Trail

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Growing fears over next year's automatic spending cuts and looming tax increases are migrating from the cloistered corridors of Congress to the campaign trail, pushing the parties deeper into their trenches and making a stalemate-driven economic setback ever more likely.
In Senate campaigns from Montana to Virginia and House campaigns in military-heavy districts, candidates are making the ''fiscal cliff'' a new line of attack. And as they do, the prospects for compromise appear to be receding.
''Everyone in the room is talking in the same way: 'We need to find a solution, we need to be pragmatic, we need to find compromise.' We just can't seem to get there,'' said Representative Bill Owens, Democrat of New York, whose opponent is attacking him over automatic military cuts that could hurt his upstate district's sprawling Fort Drum Army base. 
To economists, the standoff is maddening. Economic growth slowed to a 1.5 percent crawl from April to June, partly because businesses were already holding off hiring and investment as they wait for Washington to decide what will happen next year, said Allen Sinai of Decision Economics, a forecasting firm in New York. Virtually everyone agrees that allowing all the tax cuts to lapse and cutting spending will send the country back into recession. Yet neither side is even talking compromise.
''I'm watching the 'fiscal cliff' coming,'' Mr. Sinai said. ''It's out there for everyone to see. It's unthinkable. But unthinkable things have been happening.''
His recommendation: Congress should immediately pass what both parties agree on, an extension of tax cuts for the middle class, and then fight out tax levels for the rich and the fate of spending cuts after the election.
That is not likely.
''The message then to the tool and die manufacturer in Elk Grove, Ill., is, 'You're out,' '' said Representative Peter Roskam, Republican of Illinois, referring to small-business owners. ''If you divide that question now, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.''
Senate Democrats last week muscled through legislation extending tax cuts for the middle class while allowing tax breaks for the rich to lapse. That, they said, was their answer to defusing the fiscal time bomb set to blow in January. House Republicans will answer Wednesday with legislation extending all the Bush-era tax cuts.
From there, nothing is expected to happen until after the election.
On the campaign trail, the issues are being laid before voters in stark terms. After the disastrous partisan showdown last summer over raising the nation's borrowing limit, Senator Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat, joined 73 other senators -- including the entire Republican leadership -- in approving a deal that used automatic across-the-board spending cuts to try to force a ''grand bargain'' on deficit reduction.
Now, the Republican trying to take his Senate seat, Representative Denny Rehberg -- who opposed the deal -- is traversing the state warning of ''catastrophic consequences'' from looming military cuts -- and from Mr. Tester's vote.
Former Senator George Allen of Virginia, a Republican, last week began an all-out effort to paint his Democratic opponent for his old Senate seat, former Gov. Tim Kaine, as the candidate who will drive the country over the ''fiscal cliff.'' Mr. Kaine was nowhere near Congress when trillions of dollars in tax cuts were passed in 2001 and 2003, constructed to expire all at once a decade later, or when last summer's deficit deal was struck.
But Mr. Kaine did express support for the deficit compromise last summer. On Friday, he fired back, saying Mr. Allen helped create the deficit in the first place, with votes for spending increases and deep tax cuts when he was senator. On Monday, he pleaded with lawmakers to find a way to undo the looming military cuts.
Richard Mourdock, a Republican who is favored in the Indiana Senate race, has run as an ardent fiscal hawk, but he is also raising the alarm about the impact that military spending cuts would have on Indiana employers including AM General, the maker of Humvees, and Honeywell, which makes aircraft components there.
''In typical Washington fashion, the White House and members of Congress are playing a game of chicken with American jobs by attempting to tie their tax increase to saving defense jobs from automatic spending cuts,'' Mr. Mourdock said.
''It's time to stop the games, make thoughtful cuts in federal spending, and save defense jobs,'' he said.
In Virginia's military-heavy Hampton Roads area, Representative Scott Rigell, a Republican, and his Democratic challenger, Paul Hirschbiel, have traded charges over Mr. Rigell's vote for the same deficit reduction deal, and his later vote for a Republican measure to undo the military cuts and instead make domestic spending cuts.
''In my view it's not a political issue,'' Mr. Rigell said. ''If my challenger wants to make it so, he's got a long uphill climb.''
This week, three Republican senators, John McCain of Arizona, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, will travel to four swing states -- Virginia, Florida, North Carolina and New Hampshire -- to raise the alarm about military cuts.
Much of the fighting involves some short memories about how Washington reached this precipice. Representative Rehberg recently told an audience in Great Falls, Mont., home of Malmstrom Air Force Base, that ''the deal was cooked up in the White House and brought to Congress.''
But the deal was hard fought, with the White House among the last to sign on. Democrats had offered automatic cuts to domestic programs to help force Democratic budget negotiators to a compromise. They demanded a similar sacrifice from Republicans, preferably tax increases, according to Representative Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland and one of the negotiators. Republicans instead offered military cuts, he said.
It passed the House with 174 Republican votes, including those of Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio, and Representatives Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House majority leader, and Howard P. McKeon of California, who is chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. The 74-to-26 vote in the Senate included support from Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, Jon Kyl of Arizona, his deputy, and Mr. McCain, the Senate Armed Services Committee's ranking Republican.
The tax side of the ''fiscal cliff'' was assembled nearly a decade ago. In 2001, Republicans who controlled the White House and Congress could not get the 60 votes needed for permanent tax cuts, so they had to use a parliamentary tactic called ''reconciliation'' to beat a Democratic filibuster. That limited President George W. Bush's first $1.7 trillion tax cut proposal to 10 years.
When Mr. Bush came back in 2003 with more tax cuts, Republicans again used reconciliation, but instead of using the full, 10-year window, Republican tax writers used only seven, maximizing the initial size of the tax cuts and making sure all of the Bush-era tax reductions expired on the same day. That was supposed to increase the economic pressure on Congress to extend them or make them permanent.
''The reason 2003 was seven years is because it was all similar policy. You ought to be dealing with them at the same time,'' said Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, who was Finance Committee chairman at the time.

HEADLINE: Gloriana, Farm Inc. and Christian Scott Release New Music

BYLINE: By JON CARAMANICA and NATE CHINEN

Left Behind''
(Emblem/Warner Music Nashville)
THE FARM INC.
''The Farm Inc.''
(All In/Elektra Nashville)
At this point the pop-oriented segment of contemporary Nashville has to be considered more than a splinter wing. When Taylor Swift first arrived, it was a lightly tolerated anomaly; as she thrived, it became a rallying point for the country music world as a whole, a symbol of its power. Now other sorts of acts -- not just young women with an ear for pop-punk mixed in with their balladry -- are seeing pop crossover as part of their mandate.
Most prominently, that's included the trio Lady Antebellum, which has resurrected 1970s soft-rock harmony through a country lens and created the most viable and affecting pop-country hybrid since Ms. Swift. Its songs tackle romantic ache from both sides, male and female, and are delivered with time-tested tricks borrowed from multiple genres: country, of course, but also rock, R&B and pop. 
Lady Antebellum -- two boys, one girl -- is the gold standard for this sound, which is slowly becoming one of young Nashville's de facto modes. Running a distant but respectable second is Little Big Town -- two boys, two girls -- a group that knocks the smoothness out of the Lady Antebellum idea and replaces it with a performed fealty to earthy roots. Lady Antebellum wants to sing about seduction and loss; the locale is secondary. For Little Big Town, the rural framework comes first.
A pair of younger country groups -- both with two boys, one girl -- are stomping firmly in these bands' boot steps. Gloriana, now on its second album, ''A Thousand Miles Left Behind,'' has the smell of Lady Antebellum all over it, and the Farm Inc. -- just the Farm to its fans -- has just released a self-titled debut album that suggests more flexibility in the Little Big Town template than there appeared to be. (See also: Edens Edge -- two girls, one boy -- which released an elegant and sometimes cheeky self-titled debut album in June.)
When Gloriana released its debut album three years ago, it appeared to be looking for a piggyback ride on Nashville's youth movement; after all, at least one of its members, Cheyenne Kimball, was young and blonde.
But Ms. Kimball left the group last year, and its second incarnation -- the brothers Mike and Tom Gossin, and Rachel Reinert -- is markedly more grown. Most of the songs on this album are Lady Antebellum manque, from the tightly clenched harmonies to the notionally frisky subject matter.
But Gloriana isn't hot enough to be naughty, and isn't naughty enough to be hot. Only ''(Kissed You) Good Night'' throbs with a pulse, with Tom Gossin hissing, ''I should have kissed you/ I should have pushed you up against the wall,'' though by the time Ms. Reinert returns the sentiment, it's been bleached free of sexual tension. More typical are ''Wanna Take You Home'' and ''Sunset Lovin,' '' which never get sweaty, despite plenty of attempts at friction.
Gloriana is better when avoiding attempts at intimacy. Ms. Reinert is impressive on ''Go On ... Miss Me,'' in which she taunts the boy she used to idolize: ''Back when I was 17, you were my high school dream/And boy, boy, I was stupid.''
And the closer, ''Where My Heart Belongs,'' is a shocking improvement on much of the album. More or less a solo performance by Ms. Reinert, it doesn't aim for the cool lust of Lady Antebellum but Little Big Town's earnest embrace of small-town life, and it's seductive in its own way.
Maybe Ms. Reinert, who sounds more convincing here than anywhere else on the album, would look upon the Farm -- Nick Hoffman, Damien Horne and Krista Marie -- and its deeply sexless songs with some envy.
Its debut album begins with ''Farm Party,'' a rousing, stomping jubilee that has a flicker of Big & Rich's open-minded ambitiousness about country music's big tent: ''Don't matter if you're red or yellow, black or white/It's gonna be on-on-on.''
Mr. Horne is black -- still a rarity among country music performers -- and this group has an appealing air of social progressivism to it. (But maybe not that progressive: There is no photo of the band on the album cover.)
From there, the group spins off into several directions, showing flexibility and, occasionally, real strength. ''The Train I'm On'' opens with a resonant blues guitar, and ''Walkin' '' has echoes of Jason Mraz's easy-living lite rock, with some goofy scatting near the end.
On the single ''Home Sweet Home,'' the harmonies between Mr. Horne -- who has a smooth, light tone -- and Ms. Marie, who's wrestling with real power, are refreshing. For a group with such lighthearted and sometimes loose ideas about country music, it's a surprise that the album's showstopper is its most dour song. But ''Be Grateful,'' which falls into a grand country tradition of celebrating the downtrodden, is just that.
Though male-female harmony is this group's cushion, Ms. Marie is nowhere around to soften the blow of Mr. Hoffman's striking opening verse:
The other day I caught myself complaining
How my boss has got me working overtime
Then the stranger who was sitting there beside me
Said 'I spend all day in the unemployment line.
Are there open shifts?
Are they hiring on?
I'll work any hours even all night long
If you could put a good word in for me.'

CHRISTIAN SCOTT
''Christian aTunde Adjuah''
(Concord)
The declarative mode comes easily to Christian Scott, a fiendishly gifted young trumpeter born and raised in New Orleans and now residing in Harlem. ''Christian aTunde Adjuah,'' his fifth album on Concord, announces a new name and look for Mr. Scott, drawing from his Mardi Gras Indian heritage and beyond, to his roots in West Africa.
Musically, the album, on two discs, presents a proprietary sound and an abundance of contemporary-minded tunes. The entire package seems designed to register as a statement, though you might have trouble figuring out just what it is, other than a conspicuous celebration of self.
Mr. Scott has been a force on his instrument since his early teens, and at 29 he's still growing as a narrative improviser. He can manage breathy tension as well as clarion confrontation; on this album he clears acres of space for both. And he grounds his output in the context of an impressive young band, with the guitarist Matt Stevens, the pianist Lawrence Fields, the bassist Kris Funn and the drummer Jamire Williams. Following Mr. Scott's lead, the ensemble oozes style, employing chord progressions suggestive of atmospheric indie-rock and layering devices adapted from hip-hop.
That much has been true at least since Mr. Scott released his second Concord album, ''Anthem,'' five years ago. But he and the band have refined their methods. On a tune like ''Spy Boy/Flag Boy,'' their balance of elements -- driving rhythm, minor-chord intrigue, stirring melody -- feels fully realized. ''Of Fire (Les Filles de la Nouvelle Orleans),'' which has guest turns by the saxophonist Louis Fouche and the trombonist Corey King, convincingly echoes the most recent sonic strategies of Radiohead. And a trio of ballads dedicated to Mr. Scott's twin brother (''Kiel''), his mother (''Cara'') and his fiancee (''I Do'') achieve poignancy without tipping too far toward sentimentality.
But the album's unity of mood becomes a haze over the course of its nearly two-hour running time. That's a problem, especially given the burden of individuality bestowed by song titles that refer to Florida's Stand Your Ground law (''When Marissa Stands Her Ground''); American-bred Islamic extremism (''Jihad Joe''); a case of mass sexual assault in Sudan (''Fatima Aisha Rokero 400''); and a breakthrough in H.I.V. treatment (''The Berlin Patient (CCR5)''). (There's also a track called ''The Red Rooster,'' which is the name of the upscale soul food restaurant where Mr. Scott and his band will play a free show on Thursday night.)
And on an album so ostentatious about its social convictions, Mr. Scott seems to have grappled most with insular matters. ''Pyrrich Victory of aTunde Adjuah'' refers to the skepticism he has encountered (or sensed) since adopting an African name; it follows a track titled ''Who They Wish I Was,'' which refers to the jazz traditionalists who would have him sound more like Miles Davis or Wynton Marsalis. If that makes him seem like a touchy solipsist, comfort yourself with the thought that Mr. Scott doesn't actually budge from his moorings, not an inch. NATE CHINEN

HEADLINE: Step Right Up and Hear the Governor Speak of Saving Your State

BYLINE: By MICHAEL POWELL. 
E-mail: powellm@nytimes.com; Twitter: @powellnyt

 BODY:
Brant Beach, N.J.
Like a thunderhead blown in off Barnegat Bay, Gov. Chris Christie slides out of a black sport utility vehicle and strides into a sandy parking lot crowded with bathing suit- and Hawaiian-shirt-clad admirers.
He tugs at his pink tie, loosens his collar and grabs a microphone. With a knowing grin, he reminds the crowd of the hell they escaped when they elected him. 
''From 2000 to 2009, you had zero private sector job growth. An entire lost decade for New Jersey!''
Groans.
Tax rates had gotten so high, he says, the wealthy were packing up.
More groans.
Now private sector jobs and confidence are up. It's the New Jersey Comeback! But there's a problem -- he holds his hand up theatrically. The Democrats are ''holding your tax cut hostage.''
Loud moans.
''So let's get them the hell off the beach and make them vote for your tax cut!'' he says to furious applause. ''Don't worry, I won't let them do any harm. I will be their adult supervision.''
It's Governor Christie's endless-summer tax relief tour, and he has a vaudevillian's touch. He cracks a joke about blasting some schmo who lipped off to him and offers an ''As if I care?'' flutter of his eyelashes. That generates hilarity, so he repeats the gesture for the other side of the crowd.
But unfortunate facts offer less of a giggle. Comeback claims to the side, New Jersey displays few blushes of health. When Mr. Christie took office, the state unemployment rate was 9.7 percent, ranking 35th in the nation. Now the rate is 9.6 percent, ranking 48th.
Hours worked are down, as are weekly and hourly earnings.
Moody's Investor Services put a stethoscope to the state's chest and didn't care for what it heard. The second-wealthiest state in the nation is falling short of revenue projections and lagging in the national recovery. The governor forecast that revenues would grow this year at a 7.3 percent rate, the fastest rate in the nation.
This forecast is intended to provide the fiscal underpinning for several billion dollars' worth of proposed tax cuts. It is also -- this is not, admittedly, the technical term chosen by the analysts for Moody's -- hallucinatory.
The national news media tends to obsesses on Mr. Christie's temperament. Is he confrontational? Will he overshadow Mitt Romney? Here you might fairly answer ''yes'' and ''who cares?'' Vice-presidential braggadocio might usefully deflect attention from Mr. Romney's stumble-down-the-stairs excursion into international diplomacy.
More searching questions may be asked about his economic stewardship. No one in Brant Beach, on Long Beach Island, asked him about those revenue estimates while he was visiting last week. That's just as well. Last spring David Rosen, a respected analyst with the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services, offered a sharply lower revenue estimate. Mr. Christie was not amused.
Mr. Rosen, the governor and his aides said without evidence, was a political operative, a tool of the Democratic-controlled Legislature, ''the Dr. Kevorkian of numbers.''
I dialed up Mr. Rosen last week and asked if he had fallen into line with the governor. In the manner of a man sticking his head between a lion's jaws, he spoke with care. ''There is nothing in the revenue collections or the national economic data that would lead me to be more optimistic than I was in May,'' he said.
Mr. Christie spent much of that sticky day in Brant Beach retailing optimistic claims, although often he sounded in need of an asterisk. So he boasted that the state was adding lots of private jobs. That is true, although the state remains about 170,000 jobs behind its pre-recession high. New York State, by contrast, has recovered all of its lost jobs.
Then there's that ''lost decade.'' It turns out it wasn't so bad. From July 2004 to April 2008, the state's unemployment sat under 5 percent.
As for those oppressed wealthy, spooked by high taxes and setting off for low tax rate states, like so many Mercedes-driving Tom Joads? The governor recalls that time with eyes wide.
''People who had the wealth said, 'To heck with it. I'm not letting 'em come into my wallet.' ''
The Office of Legislative Services reviewed the literature on so-called wealth flight from New Jersey this spring, and found that those with low incomes were far more likely to run than their high-income brethren. And the wealthy often leave for other high-tax states, like New York and California.
But, really, whatever. A drum roll of thunder could be heard in the distance. The governor had to get going.
''We feel better about ourselves,'' he reminded the crowd, ''than we have in a long time.''
And isn't that the most important thing?

HEADLINE: After Bus Bombing, Bulgaria's Ties With Israel Are at Risk

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS KULISH; Boryana Dzhambazova contributed reporting.

 BODY:
SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Nearly two weeks after the bombing of a busload of Israeli tourists, Bulgarian investigators said they had yet to identify the bomber, and did not publicly indicate who they believed was behind the attack. But if the trail remains murky, the impact of the disaster on this small Balkan nation is clear: It has jeopardized its strong ties with both Israel and the Arab countries of the Middle East.
Bulgarian officials have been notably reluctant to join Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel in publicly pinning blame for the attack, which killed five Israelis and a Bulgarian bus driver, on Hezbollah and Iran, a view privately shared by American officials. Instead, the government has tried to contain details about the investigation, hoping to avoid mistakes in a situation with global political and security implications, as evidence grows of a shadow war between Israel on one side and Iran and Hezbollah on the other. 
''For small Bulgaria to come out and openly name Hezbollah in such a way is as good as entering a minefield,'' said Vladimir Shopov, a political scientist at the New Bulgarian University in Sofia. ''There would have to be absolute certainty almost. You'd have to be really, really confident that your convincing evidence could stand up before all the other members of the E.U.''
A member of the Bulgarian security establishment, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is continuing, said that there was a ''clear direction that points to Hezbollah'' in the pattern and evidence of the attack, but that it would probably be some time before any official determination was made.
Unlike the United States and Israel, which officially list Hezbollah as a terrorist organization, the European Union thus far has refused to blacklist the organization, which is a political party as well as a militant group and since last year has been part of the Lebanese government. The stakes are unusually high for a country with a population just over seven million, smaller than New York City, whose political class is normally occupied by what Mr. Shopov called ''blissful parochialism.''
Bulgaria is perched precariously between Serbia, crisis-afflicted Greece and a rising regional power in Turkey, its next-door neighbor to the southeast. A member of NATO as well as the European Union, it has been working, with the help of its Western partners, to overcome a legacy of corruption and organized crime.
The country has a sizable indigenous Muslim population, estimated at 10 percent, mostly ethnic Turks but also Slavic Muslims and immigrants from the Middle East. ''Bulgaria has a Muslim minority. We have many Arabs who came to the country and we don't want them to feel stigmatized in any way or form because of this act,'' Nickolay Mladenov, Bulgaria's foreign minister, said in an interview.
''This is a quiet country,'' Mr. Mladenov added, ''and we would like to keep it quiet.''
The country's commitments and international presence have changed in recent years, reflecting its new partnerships. Bulgaria had soldiers stationed in Iraq and still has about 600 troops among the NATO force in Afghanistan. Mr. Mladenov has tried to engage Bulgaria in the Arab Spring; in May, members of the Syrian opposition met in Bulgaria.
In a flurry of activity after the bombing, Bulgarian officials quickly released video of the bomber waiting outside the arrivals gate of the airport. But that has been replaced by stillness, as investigators wait for the bomber's DNA and fingerprints to be run through international databases. Mr. Mladenov dismissed criticism of the slow pace of the investigation. ''Let's give the people working on this enough space to do their work,'' he said.
The country's prime minister, Boyko Borissov, said last week that the attack was the work of an ''exceptionally experienced'' group of conspirators. Many of the statements made by officials here seem aimed at deflecting criticism at home over the investigation.
''The more time passes the slimmer the chances are that they will be able to identify the attacker,'' said Mihail Mikov, a member of Parliament for the opposition Socialist Party. ''If they don't find out who the bomber was within 10 or 15 days, I don't believe this will happen,'' Mr. Mikov said.
Tsvetan Tsvetanov, Bulgaria's interior minister, said in an interview that investigators were further along than they could publicly discuss without jeopardizing new leads. ''It's very important when you talk to the public that you say something where you have evidence and proof, and not just go and give opinions,'' he said.
Mr. Tsvetanov said that the bomber had been in Bulgaria for 20 days before the attack, and that that investigators had learned where the fake Michigan driver's license belonging to the suicide bomber had been made. (''Outside the region,'' he said.) ''We also have suggestions about the groups who might have organized such a terrorist act but they can't be mentioned publicly until the investigation is over,'' Mr. Tsvetanov said.
When the bombing took place, top Bulgarian officials were at a news conference in response to a European Commission report that said its progress in combating organized crime and corruption was ''not yet sustainable and irreversible.'' The special prosecutor and special court likely to handle the terrorism case began operations only on Jan. 1 of this year.
''From my perspective, no one was really seeing terrorism as particularly a field which was going to be active,'' said Katia Hristova-Valtcheva, head of the cabinet at the Ministry of Justice.
The former head of the National Intelligence Service, Lt. Gen. Kircho Kirov, said he was not surprised by the attack. ''In the last five or six years, we have had very concrete information that organizations like Hezbollah and structures connected to Al Qaeda as well as some individuals were ready to prepare attacks,'' General Kirov said.
In January, before he left the service, there was ''very concrete information about attacks against Israeli tourists,'' General Kirov said. ''We organized measures to prevent them.'' The winter tourist season passed without incident. The summer season did not.

HEADLINE: Presidential Commission Sought on U.S. Expatriates

BYLINE: By BRIAN KNOWLTON

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- At a time of widespread discontent among American expatriates over voting complications, taxation and access to financial institutions, a bill being introduced in Congress on Tuesday would create a presidential commission to take a sweeping look at how the federal government serves those abroad. 
''Right now, there's no systemic focus on issues dealing with Americans abroad, and their numbers just keep growing,'' said Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, the New York Democrat co-sponsoring the legislation.
Ms. Maloney, chairwoman of the Americans Abroad Caucus in Congress, said the level of concern she had been hearing from expatriates was ''the worst I've ever seen it.''
The growing pressures on American expatriates stem largely from two events: the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, which led to new United States Treasury Department regulations aimed at cracking down on money laundering and on the use of the international banking system by terrorist groups; and the financial crisis of recent years, which similarly brought a crackdown on Americans exploiting banking secrecy in countries like Switzerland to avoid paying taxes.
But as a result, and with the Internal Revenue Service devoting substantially more resources to its overseas operations than before, many ordinary expatriates say tax filing has become onerous and many banks are wary of doing business with them.
Expatriates have offered a number of proposals, which they hope a presidential commission would examine. Some emerged in a series of town-hall-style meetings this year for Americans living in Switzerland: creating a federal ombudsman for overseas Americans; changing the taxation system from the current one based on citizenship to one based solely on residence; and easing some tax-filing rules, for instance.
Ms. Maloney said she and a co-sponsor of her proposal, Representative Michael M. Honda, Democrat of California, acknowledged that their bill faced tough obstacles in an election year when new spending draws close scrutiny.
The proposed legislation would allocate $3 million a year for two years to finance the commission. Its 15 members would be selected by the president from nominees forwarded by congressional leaders.
''I don't think anything will happen till after the election, quite frankly,'' Ms. Maloney said. But she said she hoped at least to open a dialogue over expatriates' concerns.
Marylouise Serrato, executive director of American Citizens Abroad, welcomed the proposal.
''We're not asking for anything but just sit down and investigate these policies,'' Ms. Serrato said. ''It's a very neutral, very nonpartisan initiative.''
A spokesman for the Internal Revenue Service said it did not normally comment on pending legislation.

HEADLINE: It's D-Day For the Post Office

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA. 
Frank Bruni is off today.

 BODY:
Welcome to the week the United States Postal Service defaults on a major obligation. D-Day is Wednesday, Aug. 1, when the Postal Service is obligated, by statute, to make a $5.5 billion payment, money that is supposed to be put aside to ''prefund'' health benefits for future retirees. But, with less than $1 billion in the bank, the Postal Service announced on Monday that it would not be making the payment. It has a second payment, for $5.6 billion, due in September. Unless lightning strikes, it won't be making that one either.
On the one hand, there is no doubt that part of the reason the post office is struggling is that its world has changed mightily. Everyone knows the story: the rise of e-mail, online bill paying, and so on, have cut deeply into Americans' use of first class mail, which peaked in 2006. Last year, the Postal Service reported losses of more than $5 billion -- even though Congress allowed it to defer its annual prefunding of retiree health benefits. With or without the prefunding, the post office was eventually headed toward a crisis. 
On the other hand, that prefunding requirement is an absolute killer. It has cost the post office more than $20 billion since 2007 -- a period during which its total losses amounted to $25.3 billion. Without that requirement, the post office would still likely be struggling, but it would have a lot more wiggle room -- and a lot more cash. (Its pension obligations are also overfunded by around $11 billion.) Not since the debt crisis has there been such an avoidable fiscal mess.
It is a little startling when you first hear about the prefunding requirement. It seems to make no sense, and, as many have noted, it is something that is demanded of no other company or government agency. So why does it exist? It turns out to be one of those things that only Congress could cook up.
Since the 1970s, the Postal Service has been self-sufficient, generating money by selling stamps and offering services -- and not dependent on the taxpayer. It is thus considered ''off budget.'' Yet part of its operations -- including its health and retiree benefits -- have continued to be part of the federal budget, and thus count against the federal deficit.
In 2002, it was discovered that the Postal Service was wildly overpaying its retirement obligations to the tune of $71 billion. Not surprisingly, it soon began advocating for ways to use some of that excess. One bill passed that did almost nothing to solve the problem. Later bills that would have fixed the problem, however, all ran into the same stumbling block: they would have ostensibly added to the deficit. And the Bush administration was adamant that it would veto any bill that wasn't deficit-neutral.
Thus it was that a new fund was established in 2006 -- for the prepayment of health benefits for future retirees, with the Postal Service agreeing to pay between $5.5 billion and $5.8 billion annually. The money simply goes into an escrow account, where it is invested in special issue Treasury securities. Thus does it somehow magically help with the deficit. Also, of course, no sooner did the bill become law than first class mail began to fall off the cliff. The prefunding requirement became a noose around the Postal Service's neck.
Incapable of simply letting the Postal Service go free -- imagine what that would do to the deficit! -- Congress continues to micromanage it, offering various ways for it to cut costs and raise revenue. The Postal Service, for instance, wants to cut Saturday delivery to save money; a Senate bill passed in April defers that decision for two years. But at least the Senate bill offers some relief from the absurd prefunding of health benefits. It would also return some of the excess retirement funding.
The postal reform bill that has emerged from the Republican-led House of Representatives, however, does no such thing. Representative Darrell Issa, the chairman of the committee that oversees the Postal Service, talks fiercely about the need to lower labor costs, while describing the Senate bill as a ''bailout.'' What he is doing, of course, is using the fact that the Postal Service is going broke to impose a slash-and-burn approach -- while ignoring the central reason the post office is running out of money: Congress itself. Meanwhile, the bill that emerged from Issa's committee has never been brought to a vote on the House floor. Default notwithstanding, there won't be a vote anytime soon. After all, the Congressional recess is right around the corner.
The post office insists that the default will not affect its ability to deliver the mail. Maybe not now. But several postal experts told me that at the rate things are going, it will be out of money sometime next year. Maybe then Congress will start taking seriously the crisis it created.

HEADLINE: As Airlines Do the Shuffle, Passengers Try to Follow

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY. 
E-mail: jsharkey@nytimes.com

 BODY:
THE businesswoman in the aisle seat had planned to read on the plane from Houston to Tucson last week, but the airline industry's new version of musical chairs imposed other priorities.
A family of four boarded. As is increasingly the case, their assigned seats were not together and the plane, a United Express CRJ-700 regional jet with 66 seats, was nearly full. So a little girl, probably age 6, slid into the window seat next to the businesswoman.
And because the child was chatty and a bit uneasy about traveling many rows away from her parents, the woman spent the two-and-a-half-hour flight not reading, but entertaining the girl with talk and word games. By the end of the flight, the girl was playing happily on the woman's iPad. 
When the flight landed in Tucson, my wife, who had been observing from a nearby seat, said to the woman, ''I'll bet you didn't expect that.'' The reply came in four words, each punctuated with a period. ''No. I. Did. Not.''
That's a tiny slice of the new reality in domestic air travel, with airplanes flying more full than ever, and airlines shuffling their fleets to eliminate smaller jets and focus more on flying bigger planes in major markets that provide the most revenue.
In that process, the cramped 50-seat regional jets that were the backbone of service for midsize and smaller markets are disappearing. In some markets, that means service is being eliminated. In others, though, it means reduced schedules on fewer routes, served by slightly bigger planes like the Bombardier CRJ-700, which is a stretched version of the older 50-seat CRJ-200.
The CRJ-700 holds up to 78 passengers in an all-coach cabin, but can be reconfigured (as the one on United Flight 5176 had been), to accommodate six first-class, 28 so-called premium economy and 32 basic coach seats. By the way, whether it carries 66 or 78 passengers, the bigger plane still has only one lavatory, just like the smaller 50-seater it replaced. And its overhead bins and under-seat storage spaces remain tighter than those on full-size airplanes.
A new era has dawned in domestic flying, as airlines cut routes and capacity and fly planes more full than ever. United Airlines, for example, reported that its domestic load factor, the proportion of seats occupied by paying passengers, was 86.5 percent in the second quarter, which is around the industry average. By comparison, domestic carriers were reporting load factors of only about 78 percent at the same time five years ago, before the recession.
With planes so crowded, getting the seat you want can be a source of growing anxiety and expense. Business travelers now often face the option of spending an extra $15 to $50 or so to book an aisle seat or other preferable seat. Families traveling together on leisure trips are finding it more difficult (or expensive) to obtain seats together because so much of the coach cabin is now reserved for those who pay extra.
And airlines really love that new revenue. ''Outstanding Economy Plus and premium-cabin upsale-sales drove second-quarter ancillary revenue up 11 percent,'' Jim Compton, United's chief revenue officer, told stock market analysts in a conference call last week.
Airlines say they will continue to charge extra fees for better coach seats, while shrinking capacity as necessary to maintain higher revenues. ''We remain committed to capacity discipline to generate sustained and sufficient profitability,'' Mr. Compton said. He added that United's ''regional'' capacity (the flights operated by its United Express contractors) was 3 percent lower in this year's second quarter, compared with the same period last year.
Richard Anderson, the chief executive of Delta Air Lines, sounded the same note in another conference call last week. ''Capacity reduction is our key lever'' for profitability, he said. ''We will further reduce capacity if necessary to be certain we properly match our capacity with demand.''
A few days later, Delta announced that it will be closing its struggling regional airline subsidiary Comair in late September, as part of its continuing plan to sharply reduce the number of 50-seat regional jets in its fleet, ''while adding more mainline flying.'' The airline said that shutting Comair, one of a group of carriers that fly its regional routes under contract, would cause ''no significant adjustments to Delta's flight schedule or locations served.''
Michael Boyd, the airline forecaster who heads the Boyd Group International, said Monday that culling the inefficient 50-seat regional jets from the market makes obvious economic sense to airlines. For passengers, ''it depends on where you are,'' he said. Some midsize airports will lose even more service, but others may gain as airlines consolidate regional networks. Generally, ''there will be fewer points served,'' he said.
Airlines realize that passengers are already avoiding some smaller airports where service has been reduced, and instead driving an hour or more to bigger airports where the schedules are better. To me, this indicates that the airlines believe that passengers simply will ''make do'' -- just as that businesswoman did when she put down her book and instead helped take care of a stranger's child last week.
The new realities include higher fares, fewer schedule choices and more cramped seating -- unless you pay extra for the less-awful seats that airlines now so eagerly peddle. Welcome aboard!
''We grew up with air transportation growing and growing,'' Mr. Boyd said. ''And now, it's not going to do that anymore.''

HEADLINE: 9 Scientists Receive a New Physics Prize

BYLINE: By KENNETH CHANG

 BODY:
Physicists are rarely wealthy or famous, but a new prize rewarding research at the field's cutting edges has made nine of them instant multimillionaires.
The nine are recipients of the Fundamental Physics Prize, established by Yuri Milner, a Russian physics student who dropped out of graduate school in 1989 and later earned billions investing in Internet companies like Facebook and Groupon.
''It knocked me off my feet,'' said Alan H. Guth, a professor of physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was among the winners. He came up with the idea of cosmic inflation, that there was a period of extremely rapid expansion in the first instant of the universe. 
When he was told of the $3 million prize, he assumed that the money would be shared among the winners. Not so: Instead, each of this year's nine recipients will receive $3 million, the most lucrative academic prize in the world. The Nobel Prize currently comes with an award of $1.2 million, usually split by two or three people. The Templeton Prize, which honors contributions to understanding spiritual dimensions of life, has been the largest monetary award given to an individual, $1.7 million this year.
The $3 million has already appeared in Dr. Guth's bank account, one that had had a balance of $200. ''Suddenly, it said, $3,000,200,'' he said. ''The bank charged a $12 wire transfer fee, but that was easily affordable.''
Mr. Milner said that he wanted to recognize advances in delving into the deepest mysteries of physics and the universe. ''This intellectual quest to understand the universe really defines us as human beings,'' he said.
Four of the physicists work at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J.: Nima Arkani-Hamed, Juan Maldacena, Nathan Seiberg and Edward Witten. They work on theories trying to tie together the basic particles and forces of the universe, particularly with a mathematical machinery known as string theory.
The other winners are Andrei Linde, a physicist at Stanford who also worked on cosmic inflation; Alexei Kitaev, a professor of physics at the California Institute of Technology who works on quantum computers; Maxim Kontsevich, a mathematician at the Institute of Advanced Scientific Studies outside Paris whose abstract mathematical findings proved useful to physicists unraveling string theory; and Ashoke Sen, a string theorist at Harish-Chandra Research Institute in India.
Mr. Milner personally selected the inaugural group, but future recipients of the Fundamental Physics Prize, to be awarded annually, will be decided by previous winners.
He declined to explain in detail how he selected which accomplishments to honor or why all of the winners are men. ''I truly see this as a start,'' Mr. Milner said. ''Going forward, it's going to be up to the committee to make those considerations.''
According to the rules, the prize in future years may be split among multiple winners, and a researcher will be able to win more than once. Mr. Milner also announced that there would be a $100,000 prize to honor promising young researchers.
Unlike the Nobel in physics, the Fundamental Physics Prize can be awarded to scientists whose ideas have not yet been verified by experiments, which often occurs decades later. Sometimes a radical new idea ''really deserves recognition right away because it expands our understanding of at least what is possible,'' Mr. Milner said.
Dr. Arkani-Hamed, for example, has worked on theories about the origin of the Higgs boson, the particle thought to have been discovered recently at the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland, and about how that collider could discover new dimensions. None of his theories have been proved yet. He said several were ''under strain'' because of the new data.
Several of the winners said they hoped that the new prize, with its large cash award, would help raise recognition of physics and draw more students into the field. ''It'll be great to have this sort of showcase for what's going on in the subject every year,'' Dr. Arkani-Hamed said.
The winners said they had not yet decided what to do with their windfall.
''There are some rather mundane things, like paying out the mortgage,'' said Mr. Kitaev, who added that he was thinking about putting some of the money into education efforts.
''My success is in large part due to good education, my teachers and the atmosphere of excitement in science when I grew up,'' he said. ''I might try to help restore this atmosphere as much as I can.''
Dr. Guth agreed. ''I do think prizes like this help put across to the public that fundamental physics is important, and it's not just heavyweight boxing that's worthy of prizes,'' he said.
But he was going to warn his students not to get the wrong idea. ''Certainly, it's still not a great idea to go into physics for the money,'' he said.

HEADLINE: A World Without AIDS, Still Worlds Away

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN, M.D.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Is the world on the verge of ending the AIDS epidemic and creating an AIDS-free generation, even though a cure and a vaccine are still distant hopes?
Yes, roared enthusiasts among the nearly 24,000 participants at the 19th International AIDS Conference here last week. Their hopes are based on the extraordinary scientific gains made since the conference was last held in the United States, 22 years ago, when an AIDS diagnosis was a sure death sentence.
Among those gains: antiretroviral drug combinations for women to prevent infection of their newborns; drugs to treat and prevent infection with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, among adults; and evidence that voluntary male circumcision can reduce the risk of female-to-male transmission by 50 to 60 percent.
Today, H.I.V. has become a chronic disease that, if treated appropriately, can be held at bay in a newly infected young adult for decades -- if the patient adheres to the rigid daily drug regimen. 
Michel Sidibe, the executive director of the United Nations AIDS agency, said that the opportunity to end AIDS will ''evaporate'' if governments do not show greater political will and increase investments to make gains available to millions more people.
''All that can stop us now is indecision and lack of courage,'' he said.
Ending the AIDS epidemic is likely to be far more complicated than ending most other epidemics. The AIDS conferences assemble scientists and health workers from a wide range of disciplines, infected people, activists, protesters, journalists, elected and appointed officials, pharmaceutical representatives and others. The meetings, in part, boost morale and raise the aspirations of thousands of people fighting AIDS, a laudable goal.
But since they began, in 1985, they have become more like conventions than scientific meetings. Rhetoric is plentiful, and separating it from fact is sometimes a challenge. Activists disrupt scientific presentations and news conferences with loud demonstrations, creating a circuslike atmosphere. Lobbying for more AIDS money is a given.
Dr. Richard Horton, the editor of The Lancet, the medical journal that arguably focuses most on global health, said of the conference's new sloganeering about turning back AIDS, ''It's a marketing strategy.'' He added, ''It's one that could backfire.''
One obstacle is a failure to clearly define the epidemic or what it means to have an AIDS-free generation. While many speakers repeatedly admonished that AIDS policy must be based on scientific evidence, they missed this point. The importance of precise definitions for such hopeful words extends far beyond semantics.
Definitions of terms like these may help determine how many billions of dollars the world devotes to the battle against AIDS and how many millions of lives will be extended. A failure to meet ill-defined goals could lead to public misunderstandings that limit investments and the number of people who have access to the lifesaving antiretroviral drugs in the future.
And, as Sharonann Lynch, an AIDS policy adviser for Doctors Without Borders, said in an interview, ''We do have to get concrete in terms of what it means, because otherwise we are not going to be able to hold governments accountable'' for how they spend taxpayers' money to achieve specified goals.
To begin with, defining the word ''epidemic'' is difficult. The term is flexible and subjective, and can mean different things to different experts. Even more elusive is determining what constitutes the end of an epidemic like this one.
AIDS makes people deathly ill from problems like severe weight loss, swollen lymph nodes and a loss of critical immune cells that increases a person's vulnerability to myriad other infections. But H.I.V. infection can remain silent for several years before causing symptoms.
Some speakers defined an AIDS-free generation as the absence of people sick from the disease. But even if there is no one with AIDS, there will still be millions of H.I.V.-infected people with us for a very long time. In those terms, H.I.V. will likely be endemic until there is a cure.
Dr. Helen Rees, an AIDS expert at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, said that while scientific advances provide ''cause for optimism,'' the fact is that if many infected people stop taking their drugs, even for brief periods, they could transmit H.I.V. to others -- and those strains may well be drug-resistant.
This is not the end of an epidemic in any sense as we have understood it; an AIDS-free generation, if it arrives, will live in a world where H.I.V. very much remains a threat. Dr. Peter Piot, the United Nations AIDS program's first director, from 1995 through 2008, said in an interview that he was ''puzzled'' by the apparent lack of attention to such distinctions at the conference.
''Which generation?'' asked Dr. Piot, who is now the dean of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in England. ''Mine? Or the next one? Or my great-grandchildren's?''
Bill Gates, whose foundation is spending billions on developing AIDS preventions, expressed skepticism that the world could soon end the AIDS epidemic by any conventional definition. ''Unfortunately, we do not have the tools, and we need lots of new tools,'' with a vaccine the ultimate preventive one, Mr. Gates told the conference.
He and others called for greater accountability from AIDS workers in identifying the measures that work so they can be stepped up and those that do not so they can be stopped. For example, in countries where young people are dying in excessive numbers, he said, health workers must learn ''why they did not start treatment, and if they were on treatment, why did it not work?''
The AIDS epidemic is not unfolding uniformly across the globe. Speakers cited an undertaker in Lesotho who said he was going out of business because of poor coffin sales, as so many people with H.I.V. are staying alive.
But undertakers do a brisk business in other countries with a rising AIDS incidence. In some ways, this is not just one epidemic. Scientists often use the term ''R0'' as a statistical way to monitor an epidemic, with ''R'' standing for the reproductive number of an infectious disease agent.
When, on average, one infected person transmits an infection to more than one other person, R0 becomes greater than one, leading to sustained spread or epidemic spread of the agent. When R0 is less than one, epidemic spread does not occur, and the agent will become endemic or disappear.
In AIDS, R0 depends on a number of factors, like the prevalence of H.I.V. in a sexual network and the efficiency of H.I.V. transmission per sexual act. The R0 varies in the many different H.I.V. epidemics in the world.
''We talk about generalized epidemics and concentrated epidemics,'' said Dr. Kevin M. De Cock, director of global health at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.
''As guidance, we say if the prevalence of H.I.V. is greater than 1 percent in a sentinel population like pregnant women, we call it a generalized epidemic,'' he added. ''That is terribly arbitrary, but useful for certain discussions.''
Because the conferences, held every two years, offer one of the biggest lobbying venues for AIDS workers, pleas for money from governments, foundations and other sources are standard. Indeed, the conference in South Africa in 2000 is credited with stimulating efforts to provide access to antiretroviral drugs for millions of people in poor countries who would have otherwise died.
Many participants were disappointed that President Obama did not appear. But a large number of administration officials, members of Congress and Bill Clinton did attend.
This conference came at a time of global recession, which has reduced the financial contributions used to provide treatment to those who need it. Of the 15 million people in low- and middle-income countries who are infected with H.I.V. and need antiretroviral therapy, last year only about eight million received the drugs they needed, according to U.N.AIDS.
At the same time, participants raised questions about the ethics of providing uninfected Americans with drugs to prevent H.I.V. when poor people elsewhere with AIDS received none.
Many participants likened ending the AIDS epidemic to medicine's successes against two other viral infections, smallpox and polio. Smallpox is the only naturally occurring human infection to have been eradicated, meaning that cases can no longer arise because the causative virus has been wiped out of nature.
The World Health Organization defines elimination of an infectious disease as bringing the number of cases below a predetermined amount, or reducing the number to zero in a specific region. Polio was eliminated from the Western Hemisphere, though it requires regular controlled public health efforts to maintain that, and it still is spread in Nigeria, Afghanistan and Pakistan.
The conference participants who spoke of eradicating or eliminating AIDS failed to recognize that a vaccine was required to succeed against smallpox and polio.
In saying that the United States is committed to achieving an AIDS-free generation, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton told the conference that her definition of the phrase means ''virtually no child anywhere will be born with the virus'' by 2015. People who become infected ''will have access to treatment that helps prevent them from developing AIDS and passing the virus on to others.''
Under Mrs. Clinton's definition, many people will continue to become H.I.V.-infected, but not go on to suffer the myriad other infections and devastation caused by AIDS. ''The disease that H.I.V. causes need not be with us,'' she said.
But even if that goal is reached, millions will be living with H.I.V. for a long time to come.
Correction: August 4, 2012, Saturday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Tuesday about prospects for ending the AIDS epidemic gave outdated figures to describe the shortfall in treatment for people with H.I.V. In low- and middle-income countries, according to the United Nations AIDS organization and the World Health Organization, about 15 million people who have H.I.V. need antiretroviral drug therapy, and last year about eight million of them received the drugs they needed -- not five million, the number receiving the drugs in 2009.

HEADLINE: Panetta Urges More Time for Economic Pressure on Iran to Work

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER

 BODY:
CARTHAGE, Tunisia -- Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta sent a tacit message to Israeli leaders on Monday, urging that diplomacy and economic pressure be given more time to work before they move ahead with any military strike on Iran.
In comments to reporters in Tunisia a day before he was to arrive in Jerusalem, Mr. Panetta said that economic sanctions against Iran were increasingly effective, although he acknowledged that they might not seem so. 
His words were at odds with those of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who called the sanctions useless on Sunday. Meeting in Jerusalem with Mitt Romney, he said the sanctions had not set back Iran's nuclear program ''one iota.''
Mr. Panetta, seeming to respond to Mr. Netanyahu, said, ''These sanctions are having a serious impact in terms of the economy of Iran.'' He added that ''while the results of that may not seem obvious at the moment,'' the Iranians had expressed a willingness to negotiate, and that they ''continue to seem interested in trying to find a diplomatic solution.'' Mr. Panetta concluded that ''what we all need to do is continue the pressure on Iran.''
Although the sanctions have cut seriously into Iran's oil exports, and its currency has plunged by more than 40 percent against the dollar since last year, they have failed to force the country to stop enriching uranium. Negotiations aimed at getting Iran to give up its nuclear ambitions have stalled. Mr. Panetta and the Obama administration remain hopeful that a sweeping new round of sanctions imposed in June, meant to cut Iran off from the global oil market, will further increase the pressure.
Mr. Panetta, who spoke to reporters against a backdrop of nearly 3,000 American graves at the North Africa American Cemetery, will be in Israel on Tuesday and Wednesday to meet with Mr. Netanyahu, President Shimon Peres and Ehud Barak, the defense minister. He is the latest in a stream of Obama administration officials to call on Israel's leaders in the last three weeks. Prime among them have been Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton; Thomas E. Donilon, the national security adviser; and John O. Brennan, the counterterrorism chief.
It is unclear if the visits have been provoked by serious concerns that Israel is getting closer to a strike on Iran, or if they are political and are designed to show strong support for Israel in an election year -- or both. The Obama administration announced an additional $70 million in aid for an Israeli antirocket missile defense system just before Mr. Romney arrived in Jerusalem, and Mr. Panetta is due there only 48 hours after Mr. Romney's departure.
On Sunday, Mr. Panetta said he believed that Israel had not yet decided on a strike against Iran, but he refused to be drawn into any elaboration. At the least, the comment appeared to show less concern about the possibility of a strike than Mr. Panetta was reported to have had in February, when David Ignatius, a columnist for The Washington Post, reported, without attribution, that Mr. Panetta believed that there was a strong likelihood that Israel would strike Iran in April, May or June of this year.
In Tunisia, the country that set off the Arab Spring revolts that spread across the Middle East, Mr. Panetta met with President Moncef Marzouki, Prime Minister Hamadi Jebali and the defense minister, Abdelkrim Zbidi. Officials said they spoke about military cooperation between the United States and Tunisia and the threat of Al Qaeda in the region, but they said they discussed no specifics about any future training, intelligence sharing or military exercises.
The North Africa American Cemetery lies in Carthage between the Mediterranean and the Bay of Tunis, and it is the burial ground for Americans who died in the 1942 invasion of North Africa during World War II. Mr. Panetta laid a wreath at the cemetery and said that the many rows of white crosses and the occasional Jewish star were testimony to the heavy price that the United States paid in the war.

HEADLINE: Mr. Romney Stumps in Israel

 BODY:
Mitt Romney made a point of insisting that he would adhere to an unwritten rule and often violated rule about candidates not criticizing each other or contradicting American foreign policy on foreign soil. About the only effort he made to keep that promise during his stop in Israel was to avoid mentioning President Obama by name.
Beyond that, with some of the biggest investors in Republican politics in tow, Mr. Romney made no effort to disguise the target and intent of rhetoric that was certainly inflammatory but largely free of any sense of how we would carry out policies he was championing. 
The message -- on Iran, Jerusalem, the Palestinians -- was all anti-Obama: Mr. Romney would be a much better friend to Israel than Mr. Obama ever could be. He would be much tougher on Iran. He would recognize Jerusalem as the capital. For good measure, he insulted the Palestinians by declaring that cultural differences -- not decades under Israeli occupation -- are the reason Israelis are more successful economically. It's hard to say how this could affect policy if he were president, but it is not encouraging.
The real audience for Mr. Romney's tough talk was American Jews and evangelical Christians, some of whom accompanied him on his trip. He is courting votes and making an aggressive pitch to donors, including Sheldon Adelson, the billionaire casino magnate with the hard-line pro-Israel views who is spending more money than any other American -- $100 million -- to defeat Mr. Obama.
Despite what Mr. Romney says, all American presidents have been pro-Israel, including Mr. Obama. But that doesn't mean subcontracting American policy to Israeli leaders or donors. Mr. Romney hit an applause line by calling Jerusalem Israel's capital and agreeing to consider moving the United States Embassy there from Tel Aviv. But those policies would complicate America's ability to act as a broker in Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts.
Mr. Romney did American interests no favors when he praised Israeli economic growth while ignoring the challenges Palestinians face living under Israeli rule in the West Bank and Gaza. He showed troubling ignorance by understating the income disparity between Israel and those areas. Israel, in 2009, had a per capita gross domestic product of roughly $29,800, while, in 2008, the West Bank and Gaza had a per capita gross domestic product of $2,900, according to the Central Intelligence Agency.
On Iran's nuclear weapons program, both Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney support trying to halt it with sanctions and negotiations but say military action is an option. It is unclear if Mr. Romney, as president, might structure sanctions differently and how committed he is to negotiations.
Already, one of his advisers is contending that Mr. Obama's strategies have ''failed.'' On Sunday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel seemed to agree. Meanwhile, Mr. Romney ruled out any outcome that would contain rather than eliminate Iran's nuclear program, and he strongly defended Israel's right to strike Iran in self-defense. Mr. Obama also recognizes this right, but he has urged Israel to hold back, at least while negotiations are under way.
The tough talk raises concerns that Mr. Romney and his hard-line advisers may be more eager to take military action. Iran's nuclear ambitions are a threat to Israel, the United States, its Arab neighbors and its own people. But there should be no illusions about the steep costs and limited returns of any attack on Iran's nuclear complex.
Presidents often say things on the campaign trail that they don't mean or regret and reverse once in office, but voters can only judge a candidate on his words. The more Mr. Romney digs in on a particular position, the harder it will be to dig out, especially if the people egging you on in the first place have just donated $100 million toward your campaign.

HEADLINE: Some at Fed Are Urging Pre-emptive Stimulus

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Some Federal Reserve officials are reviving an idea that rose and fell with Alan Greenspan, the former Fed chairman, as they seek to persuade colleagues to take new action to stimulate growth.
Central bankers generally set policy based on their judgment about the most likely path for the nation's economy. But Mr. Greenspan argued that the Fed sometimes should do more than its forecast suggested, buttressing the economy against large, potential risks. He described such moves as ''taking out insurance.''
On the eve of the Fed's policy-making committee meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, members who favor additional action argued that the likely path of the economy was itself sufficient reason for action. The committee predicted in June that without new measures unemployment would fall slightly, if at all, in the second half of the year. 
But officials, including the Fed's vice chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, have sought to reinforce the case for action by arguing that the Fed also should seek to offset the looming risk that a European turndown will set off a global financial crisis, or that a failure to dismantle the potential year-end fiscal cliff of government spending cuts and tax increases will tip the economy back into recession.
''There are a number of significant downside risks to the economic outlook, and hence it may well be appropriate to insure against adverse shocks that could push the economy into territory where a self-reinforcing downward spiral of economic weakness would be difficult to arrest,'' Ms. Yellen said in a June speech.
Laurence H. Meyer, a former Federal Reserve governor who, like Ms. Yellen, served under Mr. Greenspan, said that the return of ''insurance'' as a factor in the Fed's decision-making was a necessary response to the current environment.
''There are many people who look at that idea and feel that this is what was done under Greenspan, and maybe this was one of the factors that led to excessive speculation,'' said Mr. Meyer, now senior managing director at Macroeconomic Advisers, an economic forecasting firm based in St. Louis. ''But when the downside risks have grown as large as they have become, I think you have to consider it.''
Proponents of new action continue to face resistance from officials who remain uncertain that the economy has lost momentum and would prefer to wait at least until the Fed's next meeting in September. Ms. Yellen herself is not among the officials who have said publicly that they are convinced the Fed should act now.
The hesitation also reflects widespread concern about the waning potency of the Fed's remaining tools, and about the cost of the most powerful measure, an expansion of its holdings of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities.
The Fed also is under significant but counterbalancing political pressure in the midst of a presidential election. Republicans oppose additional action, which they describe as ineffective and likely to increase inflation, while Democrats want the Fed to do more.
Several leading analysts of the central bank predict that the Fed is most likely to take a relatively modest step on Wednesday, to show its concern while it awaits more economic data. The most likely action, they said, is an extension of the Fed's forecast that interest rates will remain near zero at least until late 2014.
Sven Jari Stehn, an economist at Goldman Sachs, said in a note to clients on Monday that the Fed would extend that forecast to mid-2015. That would be more than a year beyond the term of the Fed's current chairman, Ben S. Bernanke.
Mr. Greenspan described his approach to monetary policy in a 2004 speech in which he said that central banks are in the business of risk management, and that sometimes requires ''insurance against especially adverse outcomes.''
He gave as an example the Fed's response when Russia defaulted on its debts in 1998. The American economy was expanding, and Fed officials predicted that it would continue to do so. Some had been pushing Mr. Greenspan to tighten monetary policy. He did the opposite.
''We eased policy because we were concerned about the low-probability risk that the default might trigger events that would severely disrupt domestic and international financial markets, with outsized adverse feedback to the performance of the U.S. economy,'' Mr. Greenspan said then. ''The product of a low-probability event and a potentially severe outcome was judged a more serious threat to economic performance than the higher inflation that might ensue in the more probable scenario.''
Mr. Greenspan's impressionistic approach to monetary policy was widely held in awe during his time atop the Fed, mostly because it seemed to be working. But his ideas lost considerable luster when the economy collapsed, and some concluded that he had suppressed and exacerbated the underlying problems.
Mr. Bernanke, in contrast to his predecessor, has pushed the Fed in the direction of transparent and predictable decision-making, which he says he regards as significantly increasing the Fed's power by better controlling market expectations.
Some officials and economists also look askance at the idea of insurance because of the cost. It implies that inflation will be somewhat faster in the future.
And some see little reason to talk about insurance now.
Alan S. Blinder, a professor of economics at Princeton who was a Fed governor under Mr. Greenspan, said that the central bank should incorporate an assessment of less-likely risks into its decision-making.
But he added that there was little need for such nuances now.
''The Fed shouldn't really be worrying about the finer points of risk management,'' he said. ''It should be hellbent on getting the unemployment rate down.''

HEADLINE: Pledges of Euro Support Ease Some Bond Yields

BYLINE: By STEPHEN CASTLE; Niki Kitsantonis contributed reporting from Athens, and Jack Ewing from Frankfurt.

 BODY:
LONDON -- Borrowing costs for Spain and Italy eased once again on Monday as officials in the region continued voicing their commitment to supporting the euro currency union.
The German finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, and the United States Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, issued a joint statement expressing confidence in euro zone members' efforts to revamp their economies after meeting on the North Sea island of Sylt.
And Jean-Claude Juncker, Luxembourg's prime minister and the head of the Eurogroup of 17 euro zone finance ministers, added his support in comments published Monday in Le Figaro in France and Suddeutsche Zeitung in Germany. 
''The euro zone is at a point where it must prove, with all its means, its determination to guarantee stability,'' Mr. Juncker said, adding that ''no one should doubt the collective will of the 17 countries.''
Mr. Geithner met Monday evening in Frankfurt with the president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, who incited a market rally last Thursday by saying the central bank would do ''whatever it takes'' to support the euro.
In fact, given the three-session rally in European stocks since then, the market could be set up for a significant drop if there was no sign of a big move after the central bank's governing council meeting on Thursday.
If anything, the European tour by Mr. Geithner is a visible reminder that the euro crisis, which began in early 2010, is having global repercussions.
Mr. Draghi is trying to win support for a move by the central bank to help Italy and Spain finance government debt at lower rates than the bond markets had been allowing lately. Since he stated his intention, the Italian treasury was able to auction 4.73 billion euros, or $5.79 billion, worth of five- and 10-year bonds at reduced costs on Monday.
The yield, or interest rate, paid on 10-year debt was 5.96 percent, down from 6.19 percent on June 28, while five-year bonds were priced to yield 5.29 percent, compared with 5.84 percent last month.
In market trading, Spain's 10-year bond yield fell Monday, to 6.53 percent, nearly a full percentage point lower than where it traded last week before Mr. Draghi's pledge of support.
But pledges and investor enthusiasm cannot mask fundamental problems.
The difficulties confronting Spain, which is imposing strict measures to curb its deficit while dealing with a banking crisis, were underlined Monday when new data showed that it had slid deeper into recession in the second quarter. The Spanish economy shrank 0.4 percent from the previous quarter, after contracting 0.3 percent in the first. The economy was 1 percent smaller than it had been a year earlier, according to the data.
And in Greece, which is still trying to secure its next installment of bailout money from international lenders, a meeting of leaders of the coalition government Monday evening ended without a final decision on the 11.5 billion euros in budget savings for 2013 and 2014.
The cuts have been demanded by the creditors in exchange for further rescue aid for Greece. The two junior partners in the tripartite coalition are reluctant to impose further cuts to pensions and social benefits on austerity-weary Greeks.
The office of the Greek prime minister, Antonis Samaras, released no comment immediately.
Envoys representing the troika of Greece's international lenders -- the European Central Bank, the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund -- announced Sunday that they were extending their mission to Athens indefinitely to help government leaders complete a ''credible package'' of savings.
Over the last two years, the troika has given Greece two loan deals worth 240 billion euros but has expressed frustration at the Greek authorities' slow adoption of overhauls they had promised in return for the aid.

HEADLINE: Columbia Gets $15 Million to Expand a School

BYLINE: By ERIC P. NEWCOMER

 BODY:
Columbia University will receive $15 million in financial help from New York City to significantly expand its engineering school, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced on Monday.
The money -- a consolation prize of sorts -- is related to a competition in which Cornell University and Technion-Israel Institute of Technology were awarded $100 million from the city to build a new graduate school on Roosevelt Island.
Still, Columbia administrators say, the assistance it will receive from the city -- along with at least $80 million from the university -- will help raise the national profile of Columbia's engineering school, the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science. 
By 2030, Columbia has promised the city, it will expand its engineering faculty by 75, doubling its size.
New faculty members will be expected to take on new graduate students, adding about 400 graduate students to the current 1,500.
The New York City Economic Development Corporation estimated that when its Applied Sciences NYC programs at Cornell/Technion, New York University and Columbia are complete, the city will have increased the number of full-time engineering graduate students in the five boroughs by 120 percent.
That growth will be spurred, in part, by the creation of the Institute for Data Sciences and Engineering at Columbia. The university has committed itself to making 44,000 square feet of space available for the institute, much of it on its Morningside campus.
The institute will support interdisciplinary research in five different areas, including new media and financial analytics.
The city said that its investment in Columbia would result in $4 billion in economic growth in the city and 200 new small businesses. ''This latest partnership will create thousands of jobs and economic activity in years to come,'' Mr. Bloomberg said at a news conference.
Carol Kellermann, the president of the independent Citizens Budget Commission, supported the investment strategy.
''This is an example of good economic development,'' Ms. Kellermann said. ''They may be very long run, but they will have immediate impact in terms of faculty and bringing students to New York who might not otherwise be coming here.''
The $15 million is not a grant. About $5.5 million comes from loan forgiveness by the city. Another $8 million comes in reduced power charges from Consolidated Edison negotiated by the Economic Development Corporation. The last $1.5 million comes from a favorable lease agreement under which the institute will be able to use space in a city-owned building.
Columbia administrators conceded that for a university as big as Columbia, $15 million could seem like a pretty small sum.
''It's not a huge amount of money considering the cost of doing things,'' said Donald Goldfarb, the interim dean of the engineering school. ''Just like $100 million for Cornell, to build a whole campus. They're going to spend three to four billion dollars. It's just a very small amount.''
Nonetheless, he said, it can have an outsize impact.
''It actually makes the university commit to something. That's extremely important. It all of a sudden means you're going to go out and raise money to pay for these renovations, to pay for the hiring,'' he said.
The announcement came nearly a month after the resignation of Feniosky Pena-Mora as dean of the engineering school.
The move also helps Columbia reassert its decision to enhance its presence in Morningside and Manhattanville.
''Columbia is serious about its future both in Morningside and in the Manhattanville campus,'' Columbia's provost, John Coatsworth, said.

HEADLINE: Paterson Aides Said to Have Sought Race-Based Changes to Security Detail in '08

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

 BODY:
ALBANY -- Aides to New York's first African-American governor wanted a police entourage that looked more like their boss, so they made an unusual request to the State Police: Replace at least 10 white troopers assigned to protect Gov. David A. Paterson with black or Latino officers.
The request prompted an extraordinary battle between the Paterson administration and leaders of the State Police shortly after Mr. Paterson, a Democrat, took office in 2008, according to court testimony, e-mails and interviews. 
Preston L. Felton, at the time the acting superintendent of the State Police and the first African-American to lead the agency, said the Paterson administration had sent him ''a typed request to remove 10 to 15 white troopers, and 2 African-American troopers they didn't like, and it was clear to me that they wanted to remove all the white troopers and replace them with African-American or Latino troopers.''
State Police officials believed such moves would violate state law and lead to discrimination lawsuits. Mr. Felton said the dispute became so heated that he considered making a harassment complaint in Albany city court against a top Paterson aide.
''It was something I was not going to do,'' Mr. Felton said. ''I was not going to break the law.''
Former Paterson aides adamantly dispute many aspects of the accounts. In a statement, a spokesman, Sean Darcy, said, ''There was no formal request by the governor's office to alter the security detail.''
''When the superintendent brought this to the attention of the governor's secretary,'' Mr. Darcy added, ''he confirmed there was no such request.''
Mr. Darcy also said the makeup of the security detail did not change. But, he said, three troopers who had protected Mr. Paterson when he was lieutenant governor, all of whom were black or Latino, traveled with Mr. Paterson when he became governor, because ''he had a comfort level with those guys.''
''In the end,'' Mr. Darcy said, ''there were no changes on the detail, except that the major that supervised the unit retired.''
Mr. Paterson was not the first governor whose aides sought to exert control over a police entourage. Former Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican, exerted control of his security detail through a politically connected police colonel whose role has been much scrutinized.
Aspects of the dispute over the diversity of the governor's security detail were reported in October 2008 in a column in The New York Post. A more specific account is now possible because newspapers have obtained a transcript of testimony given at the time by Glenn Valle, the former chief counsel of the State Police, in an investigation by Andrew M. Cuomo, then attorney general, into political interference in the agency. The availability of the transcript has led a number of the players in the dispute to speak publicly about the episode for the first time.
As the dispute was unfolding, Mr. Felton laid out his concerns to a top Paterson administration official, Michael Balboni, saying in March 2008 that the effort was led by two top Paterson aides, David W. Johnson and Clemmie L. Harris Jr.
Mr. Felton wrote in an e-mail that Mr. Johnson, who directed the transfers, was rebuffed and told that the transfers would be ''a clear-cut violation of our members' civil rights, in addition to their contractual rights.''
''I think David Johnson clearly took exception to being told this,'' Mr. Felton added.
Mr. Johnson declined to comment through his lawyer, Oscar Michelen.
Mr. Harris, a former state trooper, denied that he had played any role or knew of any such actions, saying the incoming Paterson administration was focused on the economic crisis.
''We were facing some incredible headwinds and many sleepless nights, and I can say to you that issues involving the governor's executive services detail weren't even an afterthought,'' he said.
After Mr. Felton wrote the e-mail, he said that Charles O'Byrne, secretary to the governor and Mr. Paterson's top aide, became incensed and threatened him, saying he wanted to knock his head against that of another official at the agency, and warning him about repercussions if the matter ever became public.
Mr. Felton said that, as a result, ''I called Glenn Valle, explained it to him, and said I'm getting tired of the harassment, and tell them it's got to stop, because I'm on the verge of going down to the court and getting a warrant against O'Byrne for harassment.''
Mr. O'Byrne denied the account. ''The superintendent's claim is the most absurd and ridiculous tale I've heard, even by the measure of Albany's brand of politics,'' he said in a statement.
The Paterson administration ultimately dropped the request. Mr. Felton retired, and the security detail was later expanded and reorganized by his successor, Harry J. Corbitt.
The dispute was not described in the attorney general's report on political interference in the State Police.
''The career prosecutors assigned to this investigation used their discretion and pursued relevant leads during their questioning of Valle and other witnesses,'' Mr. Cuomo's spokesman, Richard Bamberger, said. ''They handled the matter professionally, and during the investigation, neither they nor the attorney general disclosed negative investigative information to the media.''
Mr. Bamberger said the attorney general's report recommended ''that the State Police superintendent, and not the governor's staff, handle appointments to the detail.''
''That recommendation would address the reported concern, if accurate, and was prudent in any case,'' he added.

HEADLINE: Romney Trip Raises Sparks At a 2nd Stop

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER and RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.; Ashley Parker reported from Jerusalem, and Richard A. Oppel Jr. from New York.

 BODY:
JERUSALEM -- Mitt Romney offended Palestinian leaders on Monday by suggesting that cultural differences explain why the Israelis are so much more economically successful than Palestinians, thrusting himself again into a volatile issue while on his high-profile overseas trip.
His remarks drew a pointed rebuke from the Palestinian leadership, which angrily noted that Mr. Romney had failed to mention the years of trade restrictions imposed by Israel.
The comments came after he questioned London's preparations for the Olympic Games while in that city, drawing criticism from the British prime minister and others. And they once again overshadowed a trip that was designed to show his dexterity on the foreign policy front, as his remarks put him in the choppy crosscurrents of Israel-Palestinian affairs where American presidents have often served as mediators.
This time, Mr. Romney did not seek to recalibrate his remarks, as he did in Britain, and the comments, made at a fund-raiser with prominent Jewish-American backers, came as he has been trying to show his fealty to the Israeli cause and slice into President Obama's Jewish support. 
In the speech, Mr. Romney mentioned books that had influenced his thinking about nations -- particularly ''The Wealth and Poverty of Nations,'' by David S. Landes, which, he said, argues that culture is the defining factor in determining the success of a society.
''Culture makes all the difference,'' Mr. Romney said. ''And as I come here and I look out over this city and consider the accomplishments of the people of this nation, I recognize the power of at least culture and a few other things.''
He added, ''As you come here and you see the G.D.P. per capita, for instance, in Israel, which is about $21,000, and compare that with the G.D.P. per capita just across the areas managed by the Palestinian Authority, which is more like $10,000 per capita, you notice such a dramatically stark difference in economic vitality. And that is also between other countries that are near or next to each other. Chile and Ecuador, Mexico and the United States.''
The remarks, which vastly understated the disparities between the societies, drew a swift rejoinder from Palestinian leaders. In an interview with The Associated Press, Saeb Erekat, a senior aide to President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority, called Mr. Romney's remarks racist.
''It is a racist statement and this man doesn't realize that the Palestinian economy cannot reach its potential because there is an Israeli occupation,'' Mr. Erekat said. ''It seems to me this man lacks information, knowledge, vision and understanding of this region and its people.''
Mr. Romney did not speak to the deleterious impact of deep Israeli trade restrictions on the Palestinian economy, an effect widely described by international organizations including the World Bank, which recently reported that ''the government of Israel's security restrictions continue to stymie investment.''
The comments are likely to have little if any domestic political repercussions for Mr. Romney, but Obama campaign officials charged that they could hurt Mr. Romney's chances to ever play a credible role in the Middle East peace process, a complicated and highly charged undertaking where even mild nuances in language are microscopically examined and can take on far larger significance.
The argument comparing Israeli and Palestinian vitality is one Mr. Romney has made previously -- in speeches and in his book ''No Apology'' -- and one that he has used to explain economic disparities between other countries, as well.
But the comments on Monday, made at a fund-raiser at which Mr. Romney was seated next to Sheldon Adelson, the billionaire Republican backer, was widely circulated after The Associated Press published Mr. Romney's remarks along with the response by Mr. Erekat. Throughout the day, Mr. Romney's aides were grim-faced and exasperated as they tried to contain the aftermath of what Stuart Stevens, a senior strategist, called ''a completely manufactured story.''
''This was not in any way an attempt to slight the Palestinians and everyone knows that,'' Mr. Stevens said.
Paul Colford, the director of media relations for The Associated Press, said the organization stood by its account, which the Romney campaign described as ''grossly mischaracterized.''
The candidate's remarks came four days after he drew pointed barbs from the British prime minister, David Cameron, and London's mayor, Boris Johnson, by questioning the city's preparedness and enthusiasm for the Olympics.
In different ways, both of Mr. Romney's headline-generating remarks seemed to have more resonance because he made them on foreign soil. And they detracted from the campaign's choreographed message on days when his schedule was heavy on photo opportunities, with little or no room for public remarks.
Perhaps the one bright spot for Mr. Romney on Monday was when Lech Walesa, the former president of Poland, effectively endorsed him at a meeting at Artus Court, a building just steps from the old town hall in Gdansk, where he flew after leaving Israel.
''I wish you to be successful because this success is needed to the United States, of course, but to Europe and the rest of the world, too,'' Mr. Walesa said through an interpreter. Pounding his hand on the table for emphasis, he added: ''Governor Romney, get your success -- be successful.''
The Palestinians have long complained that their economy is in a chokehold from Israeli security measures. The West Bank is subject to trade restrictions imposed by the Israelis, while Gaza was subject to a near-total Israeli blockade on people and goods after Hamas took control of its government five years ago. Mr. Romney mentioned neither during his speech on Monday.
In the West Bank, according to the C.I.A. World Factbook, ''Israeli closure policies continue to disrupt labor and trade flows, industrial capacity, and basic commerce, eroding the productive capacity'' of the economy.
In Gaza, the C.I.A. says, Israeli-imposed border closings ''have resulted in high unemployment, elevated poverty rates, and the near collapse of the private sector that had relied on export markets.'' The agency added that ''changes to Israeli restrictions on imports in 2010 resulted in a rebound in some economic activity, but regular exports from Gaza still are not permitted.''
On Monday afternoon, Romney campaign officials did not respond to a query about whether Mr. Romney believes that trade restrictions in the West Bank or the blockade of Gaza had any dampening effect on economic activity in those areas.
But Obama campaign officials criticized Mr. Romney's remarks. Colin Kahl, an Obama campaign foreign policy adviser who was the top Middle East policy official in the Pentagon from 2009 to 2011, said American credibility and influence in the Middle East depend on ''us being seen as an honest broker.''
''But in this case,'' Mr. Kahl said, ''Romney fell off the tightrope pretty dramatically.''

HEADLINE: Strong Domestic Sales Help Lift Chrysler's Results

BYLINE: By MARY M. CHAPMAN and BILL VLASIC

 BODY:
DETROIT -- Chrysler, though it is majority owned by an Italian automaker, is not burdened by the anemic European economy.
That distinction from its Detroit rivals, as well as a competitive lineup of cars, drove the automaker to earn net income of $436 million in the second quarter, compared with a $370 million loss for the same quarter last year.
Powered by a 32 percent increase in domestic retail sales, revenue rose 23 percent in the quarter that ended June 30, to $16.8 billion from $13.7 billion a year ago. 
''Our results reflect a tireless pursuit by the people of Chrysler Group to deliver the very best quality and value across our brands,'' said Sergio Marchionne, the chief executive of both Chrysler and its parent company, Fiat, in a statement on Monday. ''Together, we are always striving to achieve more, to learn from the past and build upon our successes.''
Just three years ago, Chrysler was on the brink of collapse. Out of cash, with consumers eschewing its lackluster cars and trucks, the company was forced to file for bankruptcy protection and seek a government bailout. Fiat took a minority stake in Chrysler after the bankruptcy and has gradually increased its ownership.
Since emerging from bankruptcy, Chrysler has overhauled its lineup and rebuilt its reputation as a bold and innovative automaker. Sales and profits have followed.
''I think the company is pretty well positioned,'' said Rebecca Lindland, an analyst for the consulting firm IHS. ''It's made some systemic operational improvement, where they've been able to turn themselves into a lean, mean fighting machine in terms of productivity.''
The company said that its second-quarter market share in the United States increased to 11.2 percent, up from 10.6 percent a year ago.
''It looks like the reality of Chrysler's year-over-year sales results is setting in,'' said Jessica Caldwell, an analyst at the research organization Edmunds.com, in a statement. ''Still, even though Chrysler's success in the last 18 months is commendable, it isn't strong enough in the long term to carry its parent company, Fiat, which is running into some real problems with the European economic crisis.''
Fiat is scheduled to release its second-quarter earnings on Tuesday, with results expected to be dismal amid a sharp decline in new car sales in some European countries, including Fiat's home base, Italy.
In an e-mail Monday to Chrysler employees, Mr. Marchionne praised the ''humble confidence'' of Chrysler workers and their efforts to rebuild the company's product lineup after the government bailout. ''Living through a near-death experience has revealed the depth of courage that exists within our house,'' he said.
But he also warned of complacency, noting that Chrysler now faces greater expectations and the additional challenge of further integrating its operations with Fiat. ''This is no time to cut corners, no time to become undisciplined in our execution, no time to forget how difficult it was to claw our way back to viability,'' Mr. Marchionne wrote.
Chrysler's heavy exposure to the United States could hobble its future growth, according to analysts. ''On a sustainability front, one weakness is that because the company is not geographically diverse, it is missing opportunities in emerging markets,'' Ms. Lindland said.
Chrysler reported $12.1 billion in cash, up from $11.3 billion at the end of the first quarter and $10.2 billion a year earlier. It expects revenue for the year to reach approximately $65 billion.
Excluding a $551 million charge in the 2011 quarter for repaying government loans, Chrysler said its income was up 141 percent.
Worldwide vehicle shipments totaled 630,000 in the quarter, up 22 percent from 514,000 a year ago and in line with Chrysler's full-year goal. Worldwide vehicle sales totaled 582,000, up 20 percent from a year ago.

LONDON -- Ryan Lochte's only Olympic swim on Monday night was sandwiched between Missy Franklin's two races. He arrived in the mixed zone after placing fourth in the 200-meter freestyle in time to see Franklin's finish in the 100-meter backstroke on a flat-screen television set up so it faced him.
''She got it,'' he said.
In his economy of words, Lochte captured perfectly not only the race but the racer. Laughing in the face of convention, the clock and the highest quality women's 100 backstroke field in history, Franklin, 17, won her first Olympic gold medal less than 15 minutes after finishing the 200-meter freestyle semifinal. She had so little time to spare, she was given special permission to warm down in the diving well next to the racing pool while the men's 200 freestyle was taking place. 
Franklin's backstroke time of 58.33 seconds was a half-a-second faster than her month-old American record. Emily Seebohm of Australia, who was first after the preliminaries, first after the semifinals and first after the opening 50 meters of the final, won the silver in 58.68. Aya Terakawa of Japan was third in 58.83.
''I dreamed about this moment my whole life,'' Franklin said, adding, ''I finally got one after 17 years!''
Ruta Meilutyte did not have to wait that long. Meilutyte, a 15-year-old from Lithuania, was the class of a 100 breaststroke final that included the defending Olympic champion Leisel Jones of Australia and the 2008 silver medalist from the United States, Rebecca Soni. Meilutyte won the gold with a 1 minutes 05.47 seconds to Soni's 1:05.55. Satomi Suzuki of Japan won the bronze in 1:06.46; Jones was fifth in 1:06.95.
Matt Grevers gave the United States another gold, following Franklin's victory with his Olympic record time of 52.16 in the men's 100 backstroke final.
Racing in the second of two semifinal heats in the 200 freestyle, Franklin tried to expend only as much energy as was needed to make it into the final. She placed eighth with a time of 1:57.57 -- squeezing into the final by 19-hundredths of a second. Her turnaround between that race and the backstroke final was tighter than the smiles of her nervous parents, D.A. and Dick, who watched from their seats at London Aquatics Centre.
She had 14 minutes. By comparison, East Germany's Kornelia Ender had 27 minutes between winning the 100 butterfly and the 200 freestyle finals at the 1976 Olympics in what was considered the women's Olympic gold standard for herculean doubles.
Michael Phelps, who never seemed to rest during his eight-event programs at the 2004 and 2008 Olympics, said he did not believe he had ever competed with less than 30 minutes of rest between races.
''Missy showed a lot tonight,'' Phelps said after advancing to the final of the 200 butterfly. ''She's tough.''
Fearless, too. When Franklin was 2, she was in the ocean with her mother when a colorful fish caught her eye and she paddled after it. Her mother could not reach her and screamed at her husband, who raced into the water and grabbed his grinning daughter several yards from the shore, in 12-foot water.
That was the beginning of a love affair with the water that carried Franklin to the 2008 United States Olympic Trials at age 13, to the 2010 Pan Pacific Championships as the youngest United States team member at 15 and to a world record in short-course meters in the 200 backstroke at 16. Franklin is so used to being celebrated for her youth that it struck her as funny that she was the older of Monday's two teenage gold medalists.
There are teenage girls who will not leave the house without lipstick and mascara, and then there is Franklin, who is never caught without her smile. It is usually accompanied by a laugh that can be heard a mile away. On Monday morning, Franklin qualified third in the preliminaries of the 200 freestyle in 1:57.62 and stopped in the mixed zone to answer one or two questions. She was being led away when a reporter cried out that he was from Nova Scotia and could she spare a few seconds?
Franklin doubled back and said: ''You're from Nova Scotia? I love Nova Scotia!'' She spent the next minute regaling the man with details like how she loves to dig for clams for her mother's chowder, ''which is the best,'' when she and her parents vacation there with her aunt, Cathy Campbell.
Her aunt desperately wanted to be in the stands to watch Franklin race but she had a scheduling conflict. Campbell also is participating in the Olympics, as the team doctor for the Canadian Olympic women's soccer team, and she had an evening staff meeting. ''I insisted on them putting the TV on to watch Missy,'' Campbell wrote in an e-mail. ''When she won, we all cheered and I cried and couldn't stop.''
Franklin's tears began flowing after her backstroke race when she saw her parents on the giant video screen.
During the playing of the national anthem, Franklin forgot the words and could not seem to decide whether to cry or break into one of her signature dances. ''I was a huge mess,'' she said with a laugh.
Franklin can see the comedy in pretty much any situation. An exception, of course, was the mass shooting two weeks ago in Aurora, Colo., where Franklin, who will be a senior, attends Regis Jesuit High School. Before the Games began, she said, ''Every single race I'm going to have that in the back of my mind.'' She added, ''Hopefully, I can make Colorado proud and bring a little bit of light there.''
Her gritty double had a salutary effect on the United States team.
''Back in our team area, everybody was up on their feet,'' said Tyler Clary, who advanced to the final in the 200 butterfly after watching Franklin's swims. ''We saw her dive in, she was behind, we were like, 'Oh, God, this is going to be a bad one.' And she just kept coming on and coming on and coming on and we saw her with 15 meters to go and everyone was up on their feet screaming. It was amazing.''
In the backstroke the swimmers begin in the water with their toes on the timing touch pad, facing the blocks. At 6 feet 1 inch, Franklin struggles to uncoil her long body for the start. This time, she recovered quickly and was tied for second at the 50 with a split of 28.82, exceptionally fast for her. Franklin's final 50 of 29.51 was the fastest in the field. Seebohm closed in 30.11 and walked through the mixed zone with her face buried in her team jacket and her shoulders heaving.
Franklin did not race on the opening night of competition, and she spoke of being inspired by swims like Lochte's victory in the 400 individual medley. While Franklin was warming down between races, Yannick Agnel was taking the gold medal in the 200 freestyle.
Lochte took the race out faster than he usually does and was passed in the final 50 by South Korea's Taehwan Park and China's Sun Yang, who tied for the silver, in a final in which the world-record holder, Paul Biedermann, ended up fifth. Franklin was asked afterward if Lochte's failure to medal was a disappointment that she had to step around, lest she get swept into its vortex.
''I don't think fourth at the Olympics is a disappointing swim at all,'' she said. ''I think he did absolutely incredible and I was so proud of him.''
As her news conference was winding down, Franklin was asked where she had put her medal. She reached into her left pocket and held it up. ''Isn't it pretty?'' she said.

HEADLINE: Celebrating Those Who Help Small Businesses

BYLINE: AMI KASSAR


HIGHLIGHT: Sometimes at MultiFunding, we have to work with lending shops where there are dozens of employees in a room working to lend money to small businesses at annual percentages of 60 to 80 percent. 

 BODY:
I recently came across a photo on Facebook from the Pay It Forward movement. It was of a dry cleaner with a sign on the door that read, "If You Are Unemployed and Have a Job Interview, Bring Us Your Suit and We Will Clean It for Free." The photo struck an emotional chord in me. I believe it's this very spirit that could help us work our way out of our economic mess. Americans helping Americans is what we need to succeed.
But when it comes to the world of small-business lending, I don't see this spirit very often. Sometimes at Multifunding, we have to work with lending shops where there are dozens of employees in a room working to lend money to small businesses at annual percentages of 60 to 80 percent. The shops are backed by venture capitalists. Hedge funds lend them money, and they're having a field day in the current economy. They say they are providing a service by making it easier for businesses to get financing, and they are - but at a big price. 
Other times, we hear stories of small-business owners who are the victims of unscrupulous loan brokers. They have paid $2,500 for a business plan they didn't need, or they have paid for credit repair services even though their credit scores were above 700. Sometimes, that $2,500 is the last money they have.
The stories get tougher. Occasionally the workout groups at banks call us to try to help clients they no longer want find a new (and more expensive) lender. Many times these small-business owners take 18 percent interest loans in the hope that they will provide one last chance; often, the alternative is to just shut down the family business. The decisions are tough - and very personal.
Two days ago a woman called from rural Alabama because she was trying to open a retail store. She had $8,000 she wanted to put down on the business and was hoping to borrow $100,000. Her plan was to buy a building for $65,000 and use the other $35,000 for working capital and to stock up on inventory. I sent her back to the drawing board and told her to find a place to rent, and then maybe think about buying a building once her store was up and running. I could tell she was shattered. I had about seven seconds to absorb her reaction before the phone rang with the next challenge.
The other day, however, was special. We hosted an event for Valley Green Bank in Philadelphia, which we gave an "A" for small-business lending on our Banking Grades scorecard -- a grade that qualified Valley Green for one of our 2012 Small Business Bank Awards.
More than 2,500 banks have received an A grade on bankinggrades.com. The grade means the banks used at least 25 percent of their domestic deposits to make small-business loans. We picked Valley Green for our first awards ceremony because it is the A bank that is closest to our office and it is the largest bank in Philadelphia County to receive an A.
Several of the bank's customers came to the ceremony and shared stories of the businesses they started with Valley Green's help. The food co-op from up the street brought plums from local farmers. The new Hispanic radio station in Philadelphia was present. We had a high-end car parts wholesaler and a woman who had quit her job to provide business and operations support to her husband, an inventor. Everyone there had received a loan from the bank.
These weren't the businesses with $20 million in revenue that the big banks like to call small businesses. These were true small businesses and entrepreneurs who have been fighting the fight since the Great Recession and have been able to do so, in part, because they were fortunate enough to find a lender who was willing to offer them reasonable rates. There was a true sense of community in the room as they shared horror stories, laughs, business cards and cake (see photo).
Americans helping Americans. I will hold onto this memory as we try to survive our endlessly depressing political season.

HEADLINE: The Fed Should Stop Paying Banks Not to Lend

BYLINE: BRUCE BARTLETT


HIGHLIGHT: The Federal Reserve might do more to stimulate the economy by charging banks for the excess reserves they safely store at the Fed rather than increasing the money supply, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
The Federal Open Market Committee, the policy-making arm of the Federal Reserve, meets Tuesday and Wednesday to discuss what, if anything, it will do to stimulate economic growth. There is widespread speculation that it will adopt further "quantitative easing" and inject more money into the economy.
It has done this twice before: between November 2008 and May 2010, and between November 2010 and June 2011. The expected new effort has been labeled QE3.
Many economists, however, are doubtful that more of what hasn't worked already will do any good. Some suggest that it is time for the Fed to think "outside the box" and do something different.

In a Wall Street Journal commentary on July 22, Alan S. Blinder, the Princeton economist and former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, suggested that lowering the interest rate the Fed pays banks on their reserves would force them to lend more and thus stimulate growth.
To explain why this is potentially important, it is first necessary to explain something about the relationship between the Fed and the banking system.
Typically, when the Fed wishes to stimulate growth it increases the money supply. It buys Treasury securities from banks and credits their accounts at the Fed. All banks maintain accounts at the Fed, just as people have accounts at commercial banks. When the Fed credits their accounts, they have more money to lend.
Banks must maintain a certain level of required reserves in the form of vault cash or balances at the Fed as a percentage of their deposits, in order to provide adequate liquidity. Reserves over and above those required are called excess reserves.
Historically, banks held as little in the way of excess reserves as possible, because this was money that could be lent immediately, upon which no income was earned. One way income on excess reserves could be earned was by lending them to other banks overnight, through what is called the federal funds market.
The interest rate charged on such overnight loans is called the fed funds rate and it is essentially controlled by the Federal Reserve, which routinely adds or subtracts reserves so as to meet its target rate. Since Dec. 16, 2008, the target fed funds rate has been between zero and 0.25 percent.
Under normal conditions, such a low fed funds rate would be more than adequate to create a considerable amount of new lending. Since the rate is the basic cost of money to banks, they would make a profit even if they made loans at a 1 percent interest rate.
But rather than make loans, banks instead are simply sitting on the money, so to speak. According to the Federal Reserve, they have $1.5 trillion in excess reserves. This is extraordinary. It is as if individuals took $1.5 trillion of their savings out of stocks, bonds and every other income-producing financial asset and put it all into non-interest-bearing checking accounts back in 2009, and just left it there.
Economists have puzzled about this phenomenon for years. They note that historically the Fed never paid interest on reserves, but in October 2008 it began doing so. Moreover, the Fed pays interest on excess reserves as well as required reserves. Originally, the rate was 0.75 percent to 1 percent, but since Dec. 17, 2008, it has been fixed at 0.25 percent.
This may not sound like much, but keep in mind that interest rates on United States Treasury securities with maturities of less than two years are currently less than 0.25 percent. The effective fed funds rate is also lower than 0.25 percent. In recent weeks, it has been as low as 0.13 percent. Compared with these rates, a riskless return of 0.25 percent looks pretty good.
There is no consensus view on why market interest rates are so low. A lack of demand for loans by businesses is thought to be the key reason. With the gross domestic product growing at only a 1.5 percent rate in the second quarter, businesses have no difficulty meeting the demand for goods and services without having to invest or expand capacity.
Moreover, nonfinancial corporate businesses have more than $1.5 trillion in financial assets available to them, according to the Fed's flow of funds report. This is money they could invest tomorrow if they saw any need to do so.
Another possibility is that the economy is experiencing de facto deflation; that is, a falling price level. While this is not evident in the consumer price index, economic theory nevertheless suggests that this may be the case.
That is because theory says that the real (inflation-adjusted) interest rate is relatively stable. A recent Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis study says the "natural rate of interest" historically has been about 2 percent. So if banks are satisfied with a market interest rate of 0.25 percent or less, this suggests that the economy may be experiencing a deflation rate of about 2 percent. (The rate of deflation is added to the market interest rate to yield the real rate.)
If this is true, it explains why the economy appears to be suffering from tight money despite low nominal interest rates and a vast amount of excess reserves in the banking system. Deflation has a paralyzing effect on business activity because downward pressure on prices causes profits to be squeezed.
Indeed, the International Monetary Fund has lately warned of the danger of deflation, and The New York Times reports that China is now suffering from it. There is also evidence of deflation in the United States in daily price data collected by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Under these conditions, which economists call a liquidity trap, monetary policy is impotent because the Fed cannot reduce nominal interest rates below zero.
However, the Fed can penalize banks for holding excess reserves by charging them interest rather than paying them interest. This has been done in other countries. From July 2009 to July 2010, the central bank of Sweden charged banks 0.25 percent on their reserves, and on July 5 the central bank of Denmark announced that it would begin charging an interest rate of 0.2 percent on reserves.
In effect, this reduces the real interest rate received by banks and thus, ironically, would ease monetary policy and encourage bank lending.
No one thinks the Fed is ready to follow Denmark and Sweden. However, economists speculate that the Fed may be ready to reduce the 0.25 percent rate paid on reserves and see what happens. It would be a move in the right direction.

HEADLINE: Mango Mania

BYLINE: HUMA YUSUF


HIGHLIGHT: There is one thing that makes Pakistanis anticipate the torpid summer months - mangoes. But this year, Pakistan's king of fruits may not meet expectations. 

 BODY:
KARACHI - Summers in the city - and across much of Pakistan -- are relentless. Temperatures typically hit 100 degrees, power outages drag on for hours, heatstroke is common, and while monsoon rains bring some relief, they bring great ruin through widespread flooding.
But there is one thing that makes Pakistanis anticipate the torpid summer months - mangoes. 
With their golden yellow, blushing pink and pale green hues coloring markets by the cart-full, Pakistani mangoes are a source of national joy and pride. But bad luck - and poor logistics - are now threatening Pakistan's king of fruits.
The country is the fifth-largest producer and third-largest exporter of mangoes in the world. For as long as I can remember, mangoes have turned oppressive summers into seasons of celebration and amity. Friends and families share crates of the finest mangoes. Rival tribes exchange baskets to resolve arguments. Hotels and restaurants host mango festivals featuring mango puppets or 4-foot-high, mango-shaped cardboard cutouts strung with streamers.
Pakistan's love affair with the mango is culturally ingrained. Mirza Ghalib, the foremost Urdu-language poet of the Mughal era, was an avid mango eater who measured his health and joie de vivre by the number of mangoes he was able to consume.
Nothing (except perhaps cricket) will stir Pakistani nationalism more than the suggestion that another country's mangoes could taste half as good as Pakistan's. The only point of contention is which of the country's hundreds of mango varieties is the most delicious: , , , ? (My vote goes to the subtle and aromatic .)
Last summer, Pakistani growers were thrilled at the prospect of countries beyond Asia finally enjoying their mangoes. Not only did the British retailer Asda start stocking Pakistani mangoes, but the first-ever shipment of Pakistani mangoes arrived in the United States in July 2011 after USAID helped Pakistan to meet U.S. standards of pest control and post-harvest management. New exports to Western markets were expected to be a boon to local farmers.
But this summer's crop has not met expectations - some mango varieties ripened too late in the season, others are too small or are lacking in taste or texture. Pakistan is now likely to fail to meet its mango export target of 150,000 tons by September, instead managing to export only 100,000 tons.
This is partly because of last year's monsoon and subsequent flooding, which reduced mango productivity by 30 percent. According to some estimates, up to a quarter of all mango farms in the southern province of Sindh were completely washed out. 
But a big part of the shortfall is due to poor logistical planning: containers needed to ship mangoes are in short supply; Pakistan International Airlines does not appear to have the proper infrastructure to make shipments; international shipping companies have transported mangoes to the wrong destination or failed to secure the fruit against damage or theft en route; a cumbersome distribution system has caused Pakistan to lose out in the Asian mango market to China and India. Meanwhile, U.N. sanctions against trade with Iran have also caused a loss of $10 million to Pakistan's mango growers, who previously exported up to 40 percent of their crop to the neighboring country.
All this bodes poorly for the future. Meagre profits - or in some cases, losses - from exports, coupled with last year's widespread damage to mango farms, could compromise future yields. This would be nothing less than tragic, especially given that a worsening economic and security situation means that there are ever fewer things for Pakistanis to enjoy.
I, for one, am not taking any chances. This summer, I'm scarfing down mangoes at every opportunity. But my real hope is that the Pakistani mango's reign endures for many years to come.

HEADLINE: Answers to Questions About Boating, Part I

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: Roland Lewis, the president and chief executive of the Metropolitan Waterfront Alliance, answers City Room readers' questions about boating in New York waterways. 

 BODY:
 I've been going to the Water Day Festival on Governors Island for the past few years and it's great to see more and more paddlers on the rivers, but I'm hoping to get kids into this as well. I am a den leader for a local Cub Scout pack and want to get these kids to become aware of the harbor as a means of recreation and fun.
There are old-timers who will tell you how they all used to swim in the Hudson, but nowadays most city kids and their parents don't look at it as something accessible or safe. Any ideas or knowledge of programs that have gotten kids a little closer to the water? Thanks.
 - Posted by Peter M., Jersey City, NJ
Dear Peter,
Getting the next generation in and on the water - for education and for fun - is a high priority for all of us who care about the harbor. The Metropolitan Waterfront Alliance has compiled a great list of water educational water resource guides for kids (and their parents) called the SPLASH guide. Many of the paddling and rowing associations on New York Harbor offer programs suitable for adults and children. The New York City Water Trail Association has a listing of these boathouses. Contact them about programs.
 I pilot a large, fast commercial vessel on a very tight schedule. On any given voyage I am responsible for the safety and schedules of up to a hundred passengers. Dodging clueless amateur sailors in small sailboats is making my job treacherous and unenjoyable. Has there been any consideration of reducing or altering small craft interference with commercial shipping operating in constrained channels?
 - Posted by Bob, New York
Dear Bob and Respondents,
The harbor "rules of the road" challenges described from either perspective (recreational vs. commercial boating) are problems of plenty. Our port (the largest on the eastern seaboard and third largest in the country) is growing, ferry use is expanding and recreational boating is resurgent. These are the growing pains of a busy and shared harbor. Much like the way that the New York City Department of Transportation is increasingly balancing the needs of pedestrians, bikers and autos, so will the Coast Guard and the New York and New Jersey Harbor Operations and Safety Committee (Harbor Ops) work through common sense and safe solutions to the conflicts on our busy waters - solutions that will give a maritime answer to the famous plea from the late Rodney King - "Can't we all just get along." A good reference list for the generally accepted on-water "rules of the road" can be found here. The calls in many of the comments for required and increased boater education for all who ply our waters are dead on. A good place to start is the national and local Power Squadrons, who are leaders in boater education.
 Where can you put in to kayak the creeks around Fresh Kills on Staten Island?
 - Posted by Ken H, Buffalo, NY
Dear Ken,
Though I know for a fact that sanctioned and unsanctioned paddlers have explored the new Fresh Kills Park in Staten Island, there are no official sanctioned New York parks department kayak launch sites there yet. I also know that waterborne recreation is in the plans for this huge beautiful waterfront addition to the city park system. See the plans at http://www.nycgovparks.org/park-features/freshkills-park.
The facilities for boating in the New York metro area are surprisingly limited, to say the least. Jersey City has risen to the task, somewhat, but Bayonne (a narrow peninsula) has only one small facility on the Newark Bay side and a "Yacht Club" worthy of its own feature article, in the Kill Von Kull near the Bayonne Bridge. This whole area has the potential of becoming the yachting and boating capital of the entire Northeast, but instead, is left to rot. What a shame.

Dear nynynyny,
You are so right about the paucity of marinas, launches and docking facilities in the metropolitan region. While we have more than around 700 miles of waterfront between New York and New Jersey on and around our harbor, there is little protected water that would serve the needs of recreational boating. By leaving recreational boats off the water, we are also losing economic development, jobs and money in our region. This industry so active in places like Fort Lauderdale, Newport and Seattle could add much to the New York Harbor aesthetically and financially. For instance, a few years ago the National Marine Manufacturers Association estimated that the 4,000 slips in the City of Chicago generated $80 million in economic activity. The New York Harbor has the capacity to generate much more. Bayonne has much promise for more recreational boating. But bear in mind the limitations posed by the heavily used shipping channels of the Kill Van Kull and Newark Bay.
 Is there anywhere in the 5 boroughs where I can continue working on my sailing skills at a reasonable price? Thank you!
 - Posted by Lovie Pignata, Bronx
Dear Lovie,
There are a number of places where you can learn sailing as a novice or continue your sailing education. All of the schools listed below have what is called Basic Keelboat certification (ASA 101), which is priced from the low $300s to $400. This two- or three-day course covers everything needed to master basics of sailing with a keelboat. Last summer I earned my certificate and began my sailing career at the Manhattan Sailing School. Others in the area with reasonable sailing lessons are Hudson River Community Sailing, the Offshore Sailing School, SailNY and Atlantic Yachting. 
 Why are there no pump-out facilities in Mill Basin? I would favor a law requiring any dock or marina selling marine diesel and/or gas to also offer, for a small fee, pump-out.
 - Posted by John Harris, Queens/Brooklyn
Dear John Harris,
You are correct there are no pump-out stations in Mill Basin, but there is one close by in Shell Bank Creek. Here is a map of pump out facilities in the harbor from the New York City parks department Web site. The map is created and maintained by the civic organization Going Coastal. Your idea of increasing the number of these facilities is good. Environmental stewardship should be paramount for any recreational boater. Here to help is a comprehensive guide to green boating practices from the parks department.

HEADLINE: The Border That Stole 500 Birthdays

BYLINE: FRANK JACOBS


HIGHLIGHT: The story behind the the International Date Line. 

 BODY:
Late last year, some 500 inhabitants of Samoa [1] had their birthday stolen. In a curious experiment in collective time travel, the entire Pacific island nation skipped Dec. 30, 2011, resulting in the seamless succession of the 29th by the 31st. By sacrificing one day - and those 500 birthdays [2] - Samoa was able to hop back across to the Asian side of the International Date Line, bringing its calendar in line with Australia, China and other major trading partners. Trade had also been the argument for the previous change, in the other direction: in 1892, Samoa celebrated two consecutive 4ths of July, to align itself with the American side of the Pacific [3]. 
Both Samoan adjustments are but two examples of the mind-boggling things that can mess up the seemingly straightforward act of timekeeping at or near the 180th meridian, ever since it was elevated to become the I.D.L. - the fixed borderline between the two calendar days that share the planet at any given time. 
The date line is the logical consequence of the so-called Circumnavigator's Paradox, which was known to scientists [4] before it was witnessed for the first time by Antonio Pigafetta in the early 16th century. One of only 18 crew members out of 237 to survive Ferdinand Magellan's first circumnavigation of the globe [5], Pigafetta meticulously kept a diary throughout the voyage. When the ramshackle ship Victoria made landfall at the Cape Verde islands after almost three years' absence from lands accustomed to Western timekeeping [6], he noted: 
On Wednesday, 9th July [1522], we sent the boat ashore to obtain provisions And we charged our men [that] they should ask what day it was. They were answered that it was Thursday, at which they were much amazed, for to us it was Wednesday, and we knew not how we had fallen into error. For every day I, being always in health, had written down each day without any intermission.
Pigafetta eventually wised up: "As we were told since, there had been no mistake, for we had always made our voyage westward and had returned to the same place of departure as the sun, wherefore the long voyage had brought the gain of twenty-four hours, as is clearly seen." 
So how exactly does drawing a line across the Pacific solve this issue? Why isn't it enough merely to change the date at the stroke of midnight in each successive time zone? Because, if you think about it, that's logically impossible. With only a single line moving westward across the planet, what exactly is it separating? The same date from itself? No - it is precisely because midnight separates dates from each other that we need two date lines to separate them, one moving and one fixed. 
 Picture that movable date line - the stroke of midnight - racing across the earth at the speed of one time zone an hour. When the clock strikes 12 [7] in the first zone west of the fixed date line, a new date is born in a sliver one time zone wide, stretching from pole to pole. As the hours tick away, that slice grows wider across the Earth's circumference. The new date races ahead of the sunrise, lighting up the east as the day races west. Inexorably, as the date circles the Earth to rejoin the fixed line, the "new" date becomes the "old" one, to be replaced in turn by the next one as the midnight hour once again crosses the date line [8]. 
 So the need for a fixed date line was real (if not immediately obvious). But there is no reason it should run across the Pacific, except the convenience of avoiding populated areas. As it happens, its course was determined more or less by default. The I.D.L. is a byproduct of the International Meridian Conference of 1844. In October of that year, delegates from 25 countries convened in Washington to find "a meridian to be employed as a common zero of longitude [9] and standard of time reckoning throughout the world," and settled on the one going straight through the Greenwich Observatory, in the east of London. International acceptance of this Prime Meridian would eventually [10] streamline cartography, navigation and timekeeping. 
 Its anti-meridian, 180 degrees east (and west) of Greenwich [11], was the natural choice for a date line, but neither the International Meridian Conference, nor any other subsequent global committee, ever sanctioned its "official" use. As the English-American geographer George Davidson said at the end of the 19th century: "There is no International Date Line; the theoretical line is 180 degrees from Greenwich, but the line actually used is the result of agreement among the commercial steamships of the principal maritime countries." 
That line, theoretical and straight, acquired many kinks and bends, first due to those agreements between steamship companies, dividing the Pacific into spheres of Asian and American zones of influence, and later due to the unilateral declarations of the navies and nations involved. As no international body regulates the course of the I.D.L., it can be changed by simple declaration by any party. 
Up until the first half of the 19th century, the (even more) informal predecessor of the I.D.L. included the Philippines on the "American" side: it was then a Spanish colony, and most of its traffic and commerce was with Spanish South America. This put it at odds with most of its neighbors. Manila made the switch to the "Asian" side of the date line in 1845. But even after this so-called Philippine Adjustment, the approximate date line showed a large, westward-billowing bulge, skirting the islands of Japan, the Philippines and New Guinea. 
 After 1884, several adjustments knocked the anti-meridian into the shape we now recognize as the International Date Line. As the 180th meridian cuts the tail off Siberia's extreme east and in turn separates the easternmost Aleutian islands from the rest of Alaska, the line on its way down from the North Pole was provided with an eastward zig [12] and a westward zag that placed each neatly in the more appropriate time zone - and managing to run in between the neighboring islands of Big Diomede (Russia) and Little Diomede (United States): separated by no more than 2.5 miles of the freezing waters of the Bering Strait, the islands are nevertheless forever and a day locked in two different dates [13]. 
 Below the Aleutian wedge, the I.D.L. resumes its course south along the 180th meridian, until it approaches the island nation of Kiribati, a collection of 32 atolls and one island straddling the Equator, sprawled out over 5 million square miles of Pacific Ocean. Until 1995, this former British colony was divided by the I.D.L. By extending the border eastward - almost to 150 degrees west, farther east than Honolulu - Kiribati eliminated this nuisance. As a bonus, the Line Islands in the country's east have the most advanced time on earth, becoming the first land on the planet to greet each new day. 
 South of Kiribati, the I.D.L. again turns west, dividing Asian' from "American" Samoa, but staying east of the 180th meridian to include islands closely linked with Australia and New Zealand in their time zone. Near the uninhabited Antipodes Islands, the I.D.L. re-finds the 180th meridian, and continues to the South Pole [14]. 
 The International Date Line may not be an officially sanctioned border, and its raison d'tre rather counter-intuitive, but it is essential for good, global time-keeping. Its unofficial nature allows its bordering nations to switch sides according to political and economic expedience. And its genesis as an afterthought to the Prime Meridian recalls a time when Europe was at the center of the world. In fact, Greenwich and the International Date Line can be seen as carbon copies to the meridians of Tordesillas and Zaragoza, which divided the world between Spain and Portugal in the 16th century [15]. 
 In 1899, the Tripartite Convention separated the previously independent Samoan islands into a German and an American part. German Samoa was taken over by New Zealand in 1914, after which it was known as Western Samoa, initially also after its independence in 1962. The name-change to simply "Samoa" raised a storm of protest in American Samoa, which felt it as a slight to its own Samoan identity. In American Samoa, which remains an unincorporated territory of the United States, the preferred nomenclature for its independent neighbor still is "Western Samoa." 
 There are about 180,000 Samoans; 1/365th of that total, about 500 people, would have missed their birthday on Dec. 30. 
 American business interests persuaded Samoa's king, Malietoa Laupepa, to adopt American reckoning. July 4 was picked as a symbolic date for this temporal realignment. Margaret Isabella Stevenson (mother of the writer Robert Louis Stevenson), described the event in her "Letters from Samoa": "In former days, communication was entirely with Australia, and it was simpler and in every way more natural to follow the Australian calendar; but now that so many vessels come from San Francisco, the powers that be have decided to set this right, and to adopt the date that belongs to our actual geographical position. To this end, therefore, we are ordered to keep in this week, which will set us straight." 
 First reported as a theoretical phenomenon by the 14th-century Syrian geographer Abu al-Fida (a. k. a. Abulfeda) in his "Taqwim al-Buldan" ("Portrait of the Countries"), and repeated, later that same century, by the French scholar Nicolas Oresme. Briefly: if X stays put, and Y and Z circle the Earth westward and eastward respectively to meet up with X after he has counted 10 days, Y will have counted 9 days and Z will have counted 11. The phenomenon played a crucial role in Jules Verne's "Around the World in 80 Days." Curiously, Abulfeda, Oresme and Verne all have lunar craters named after them. 
 Magellan, who began his expedition in 1519, discovered the strait named after him, and named the Pacific Ocean. He was killed in the Philippines in 1521. For centuries, an imaginary southern continent that graced many maps bore his name. See Strange Maps No. 575. 
 Western time was still kept according to the Julian calendar, devised by Julius Caesar. It was superseded in 1582 by the Gregorian calendar, which has since been adopted by most of the world. On its introduction, the Gregorian calendar required a leap of 10 days to correct its more-imperfect predecessor's aberration. The dates between Oct. 4 and 15 were scrapped, producing a lot of unhappy birthdays. 
 At that singular moment, the entire earth would be covered by one date only - were it not for daylight saving time, and a few time zones with shifted time-keeping. These zones, near the I.D.L., result in not two but different calendar days being in use in a two-hour window every 24 hours. 
 Meaning that, even if a day lasts only 24 hours in any given time zone, every date exists for 48 hours between the first and last time zones on the planet. 
 Before 1884, a confusing number of prime meridians were in use, maintained mostly as tent poles to keep aloft the canvas of national pride. There were prime meridians of Paris, Rome, St. Petersburg, Washington and even Antwerp, Belgium, where Mercator and Ortelius published their first atlases. The Greenwich meridian was proclaimed in 1851; in spite of other nations' pride, British sea power meant that two-thirds of ships worldwide used it even before the 1884 conference. 
 Support for Greenwich wasn't unanimous. France and Brazil abstained from the vote (and Santo Domingo, now the Dominican Republic, voted against it). The French stubbornly continued to use the Paris meridian for navigation until 1914 - and still mark it on some maps. 
 Equidistant from Greenwich in both directions, this meridian also doubles as the left and right borders of the classic Eurocentric map, which places the Prime Meridian at its center. 
 Wrangel Island, off the northern Siberian coast, is cut in half by the 180th meridian; in 1921, the Swedish-Canadian explorer Vilhjalmur Stefansson claimed it (or perhaps only the part east of the 180th meridian) for Canada. A map by the British Hydrographic Department shows the I.D.L. bisecting Wrangel, possibly to bolster the Canadian claim. By 1926, Russian settlers had dispelled Canada's shaky claim. 
 Somewhat reminiscent of the setup for Umberto Eco's novel "The Island of the Day Before." 
 Had it followed a straight line, the I.D.L. would have been 12,426 miles long.

HEADLINE: San Francisco Considers a User Fee for Drivers

BYLINE: JIM MOTAVALLI


HIGHLIGHT: As part of a long-range plan, a nine-country regional transportation agency considers a proposal to tax drivers for the miles they travel, perhaps using GPS technology to collect the data. 

 BODY:
It is not uncommon for people to grumble about paying highway tolls. But a stronger public reaction seems likely if a proposal to tax drivers for the miles they travel, perhaps using GPS technology to collect the data, ever becomes regional law in Northern California.
The concept is under study by the Metropolitan Transportation Commission, a regional agency covering nine counties in the San Francisco Bay area. But agency officials, possibly in response to an uproar over privacy concerns, point out that it is merely one idea among many being considered. A similar concept has been floated in Florida.
The idea of drivers paying for their vehicle miles traveled, or V.M.T., sounds fairly radical, but it was actually endorsed by a bipartisan Congressional commission in 2009. The National Surface Transportation Infrastructure Financing Commission recommended that the federal government switch from a gas tax model to what it called a mileage-based usage fee by 2020. The switch "more accurately aligns the costs and benefits of the surface transportation system to those who are using it," the group said in a statement. But this was one more bipartisan commission whose ideas weren't enacted.
Randy Rentschler, a spokesman for the regional commission, said in a telephone interview that the V.M.T. proposal was a small part of long-range planning updated by the agency every four years. He said the concept of a highway use fee was included as a result of lobbying from environmental groups.
"We said we'd take a look at it," Mr. Rentschler said. "But it's way too early to say if any plan would track people's mileage with GPS. That's one way it could work."
Mr. Rentschler acknowledges that a mileage fee will not be universally popular. "We know that people don't pay the full cost of driving -- that's obvious," he said. "But when we introduce measures to pay for such costs, they frequently resist. We also know that a fee plan like this could reduce traffic congestion and raise a considerable amount of revenue to pay for transportation-related programs that people say they want."
The commission's staff will prepare a report on the various proposals, including the V.M.T. fee, by December.
TransForm, a transit advocacy group in the Bay Area, is one of the groups that lobbied the commission to include the mileage proposal. Stuart Cohen, the group's executive director, said in a telephone interview that inflation had eroded the value of the flat gasoline tax, resulting in "billions of dollars in unfunded transportation needs."
A user fee, he said, was fairer than raising revenue through a sales tax that was also paid by nondrivers. "It's better than paying for roads through taxes on toilet paper and groceries," he said.
Would a highway user fee unfairly impact low-income commuters? Mr. Cohen said the tax could be made equitable with relief for drivers below certain income thresholds. "A concept like that could be popular and supported in the Bay Area," he said.
Privacy issues are raised because a GPS-based system could also collect information on when and where drivers traveled. "I don't want to minimize the privacy concerns, but tracking people is the last thing we care about," Mr. Rentschler said.
"We'd like to see it happen first in the Bay Area, where we are more likely to do it right, with low-income provisions and revenue going to alternative transportation options," Mr. Cohen said. "It will percolate as an idea here more than it will in, say, Texas."

HEADLINE: Philadelphia Orchestra Emerges From Bankruptcy Protection

BYLINE: DANIEL J. WAKIN


HIGHLIGHT: The development happened according to schedule, a little more than a year after the orchestra sought protection under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code. 

 BODY:
The Philadelphia Orchestra has stepped into the sunlight, announcing on Tuesday that it formally emerged from operating under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code. The development, which happened according to schedule, comes after a little more than a year of operating under the cloud of bankruptcy protection. No major American orchestra, amid periodic waves of economic hardship in the symphonic world, had taken the measure before.
Orchestra officials said the filing, on April 16, 2011, was necessary to deal with a high pension burden and mounting losses from a drop in donations and ticket sales. "There is much critical diligence and fiscal capitalization to be achieved for the orchestra," its president and chief executive, Allison Vulgamore said in a prepared statement, adding, "and we embrace this new era - and our audiences - with gratitude and dedication." The orchestra is now playing at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center and opens its main season at Verizon Hall on Oct. 18.

HEADLINE: America's Friend in Need

BYLINE: ELIAS TABAN


HIGHLIGHT: As an oil dispute cripples the economies of the two Sudans, a South Sudanese Bishop asks for U.S. help. 

 BODY:
I have spent over 40 years of my life at war. I was born minutes before Sudanese soldiers gunned down the leaders of my village in South Sudan and I spent the first week of my life hiding in the jungle with my mother. I became a child soldier thirteen years later and survived only by the grace of God. In the years since, I have worked to seek peace as a chaplain for the Southern rebels and now as the head of the Sudan Evangelical Alliance and the Sudan and Uganda Evangelical Presbyterian Church.
Too many people have died in my country, but millions more would have died if the American people and churches had not sent aid and put pressure on Khartoum to negotiate peace with the Southern rebels. The U.S. helped South Sudan gain independence about a year ago. But we need continued involvement from our American brothers and sisters to ensure our nation survives its infancy.
My life's prayer is that we turn our swords into ploughs and instead of digging graves we dig wells and build foundations for hospitals. But over the last year, the leaders of Sudan and South Sudan have remained locked in political disputes that have resulted in violence along our shared border and a growing economic crisis. South Sudan has the majority of the region's oil, but the pipelines to ship it pass through Sudan. This mutual dependence on oil revenue could help build cooperation between north and south after independence. Instead oil has become a weapon both sides use to harm the other.

After Khartoum unilaterally seized southern oil in lieu of transport fees that the two countries had failed to agree on, South Sudan decided to halt oil production in January. It was a bold move, but it was justified: Khartoum benefited from southern oil for years even as it marginalized the south.
But even when one is in the right, justice and revenge can become easily confused. There must always come a point where we look forward and recognize the need to stop fighting over past wrongs so we can build toward a new future. That time has come for South Sudan. We must restart oil production and work out an agreement to transport it through north Sudan. But we will need international support and pressure on Khartoum if that plan is to succeed. This month, the two parties met in Addis Ababa to negotiate a new oil deal, but yet again could not reach an agreement.
The cessation of southern oil production and export has hurt both countries and weakened our fragile peace. The region has lost its primary funding stream. South Sudan has seen nearly 80 percent inflation. Families are struggling to get by, and half of the South Sudanese population faces food shortages. All the progress the country has made over the last year on education and health is grinding to a halt as funding runs dry.
This is not how it should be. Both Sudan and South Sudan are blessed with fertile lands created by two rivers that join to form the Nile. We should be the breadbasket of Africa and a model for cooperation between the Middle East and Africa.
The U.S. should use its leverage in Sudan and South Sudan to help the two countries come to an agreement on transparent oil transportation fees. We also need international help in finalizing the boundary between Sudan and South Sudan. And we need help from the government, NGOs, and church friends in the U.S. to ensure that the vast humanitarian needs in South Sudan are met as the world's newest nation continues to develop its enormous agricultural potential. America has been an ally throughout our struggles, and I don't think there is a country in the world that loves Americans more than South Sudan.
My faith teaches that suffering and strife may last the night, but joy and peace come with the dawn. I still believe we will build schools, homes, and communities, and that my children can grow up without experiencing the violence and strife that have defined my life. I am asking that America continue to walk this road with us as we seek a new dawn for our region.

The next major step in our story on the plight of the American economy - part of The Times's Agenda series - is to examine the causes. As I noted in the initial post, median family income in this country is lower today than 12 years ago, a stretch unlike any other since the 1930s.
On the most basic level, the causes are a slowdown in economic growth and an increase in income inequality: the pie is growing more slowly, and a large share of the gains is going to a small portion of the population. But that statement is as much an accounting statement as anything else. It doesn't explain the forces driving the changes.
More than 700 comments have been posted on that post, and many of these addressed underlying causes. Below, we are excerpting a selection of those comments, because we assume that most readers did not have time to read hundreds of them.
I am also using the responses to help me write a survey I'm sending to a range of economists asking them to discuss what they see as the most important causes. Some may rank causes or put them in different buckets of importance. Others may use the survey as inspiration to write a few paragraphs laying out their views.
In coming days and weeks, we'll be posting the survey itself and then the economists' responses. Other Times writers will also be posting items on these issues. And we welcome continued reader feedback at every step. 
Here is a sampling of those reader comments:
"Most of the income gains seen in my lifetime have been created by families going on afterburners -- sending the other adult out to work. Now, we are seeing families going backwards, but that may be a good thing. But we will need to learn to get by on less, especially if competition by foreign workers accelerates." 
"Interesting that this appears on the same page as the article about Caterpillar. Is it really necessary for them to freeze wages when they are making record profits? You can bet that the upper echelon of company officers will not have frozen wages. There are many hard issues that contribute to the problem, global wage competition, automation, poor education, but these are exacerbated by actions taken by companies like Caterpillar." 
"Population growth in the USA as well as in Europe has slowed considerably. One of the options is to liberalize immigration, which will attract talented people as well as wealthy people from other countries. This will result in economic growth by the new immigrants spending money by opening new businesses and improving employment prospects for locals." 
"I have a theory the middle class aren't making more because the Government is taking more. Publish that chart and prove me wrong." 
"People working in manufacturing industries that lacked strong unions were always poorly compensated. It's just that now there are very few industries that are unionized and the pressure to compensate employees has declined across the board." 
"Shouldn't you use an income number that captures the value of benefits received by Households? With health care costs increasing at a much faster rate than inflation, health care (and health insurance), is eating up wage/income gains ... Employees need to understand that money spent on them -- whether wages or benefits -- is fungible from the standpoint of the employer. Ignoring these in-kind benefits overstates the share of income that goes to the top and understates the amount that goes to everyone else." 
"Since WWII, the idea that one is solely responsible for their own success has widely taken root and the generations since have increasingly failed to acknowledge that success is the product of both individual initiative/hard work AND opportunity. The first generation that had the privilege of combining hard work with unprecedented levels of opportunity was the baby boomers and, speaking very generally, they seemed to forget the opportunity component as they rose through the professional ranks of business and government. This explains policies that reward the haves while eroding the opportunity (education, health care, higher minimum wages, pensions) that allows have-nots to use their individual initiative to pull themselves out of the lower classes." 
"I would like to know what happened in the Clinton years (and before) that led to the rise in income as well as the surplus at the federal level in those years, and why that is, or isn't, possible now."
"The uncomfortable truth is that America's economy has progressed beyond blue collar jobs and is now a service economy. Our biggest export is knowledge (in the form of technology, patents, business, etc), and is no longer 'stuff.' So it is slightly misguided to blame manufacturing companies that don't pay workers higher wages, because these companies are no longer in industries where their workers can demand a premium."
"Tax cuts for the rich have turbocharged inequality, beginning with Reagan and culminating with Bush II. To afford these tax cuts, we've cut everything else that helps the middle class, especially really great public schools."

HEADLINE: Q. and A. With Damien Cave and Reader Reactions on Drug Policy in Latin America

BYLINE: DAMIEN CAVE


HIGHLIGHT: Reporter Damien Cave is answering your questions on drug policy in Latin America. 

 BODY:
Thank you - gracias a todos - for sending along your smart, tough questions and comments. I was impressed to see readers contributing (here, on Twitter and on Facebook) from at least a half dozen countries and many parts of the United States, which is proof, perhaps, of how far and wide the debate over drug policy has become.
Clearly, especially in Latin America, there is a growing desire for new ideas as frustration with the war on drugs expands. My article on Uruguay's plans for marijuana legalization offers a close look at just one of the alternative policies being considered, but your questions ranged more broadly to issues of economics and American policy.
This will be an ongoing Q. and A., and this is a topic that I will continue to cover (after a few weeks in the Middle East), so please keep asking questions. In the meantime, here are some answers.
Q.
As Uruguay moves forward with this plan, it is unimaginable that Washington will tolerate it. How far will the U.S. go to maintain marijuana prohibition abroad, and how far will Uruguay go to resist pressure from our country?
A.
There were a lot of questions about the likely American reaction. When it comes to drug policy at home and abroad, the United States is in the midst of what could be seen as either a messy moment of contradiction, or a period of transition. American officials in Washington and around Latin America no longer walk in lockstep, no longer speak only of ridding the world of drugs to stamp out American addiction. Some, especially those in the Drug Enforcement Agency, still insist that because prohibition is the law (worldwide because of United Nations treaties), their job is to enforce the law with as much force as possible. But there are also those who have become more pragmatic, and more accepting of the fact that other countries may want and need to go their own way.
For example, some advocates of marijuana legalization point out that the Obama administration has moved ahead of its predecessors by letting Latin American leaders - at the recent meeting of the Organization of American States - know that American policy makers are at least willing to discuss legalization, even if they remain extremely skeptical that the idea is worth pursuing in the United States. Officials I have interviewed said they mainly need to see some specific proposals that do more than just blame American drug consumption for the regions crime problem; they want Latin American leaders and legalization proponents to explain which drugs would be legalized, over what time period, and how the likely consequences might be managed.
"We are open to listening," the American official said. "We are willing to admit we don't have all the solutions."
In the specific case of Uruguay, there are several reasons why the U.S. would be unlikely to get involved in trying to keep the legalization proposal from becoming law. Part of it is simple geography: Uruguay is far from the United States, and the drugs that pass through there either stay around Montevideo, or go to London or Madrid, not Los Angeles or New York. There is not the same kind of vested interest in Uruguay as there is in, say, Honduras, where cocaine from the Andes often stops before heading north.
Uruguay is also tiny - just a few million people. That means that opening the market to legal marijuana would not necessarily have an enormous impact throughout the region or worldwide. Nor would letting Uruguay smoke up legally have much of an impact on American domestic politics, which is perhaps why some Americans in the drug enforcement business seem mostly curious about the proposal's prospects. For example, when I recently asked some American antidrug officials about it, their response amounted to: "Well, its a small enough country, maybe they can pull it off."
The bigger challenge may be with the United Nations. Officials with the U.N. made clear to me that Uruguay's plan, if it became law, would be a clear violation of the 1961 Convention that made marijuana a level one substance deserving of prohibition. At the far end of the spectrum, U.N. officials said, that could open the country up to sanctions that would keep Uruguay from being allowed to distribute certain pharmaceutical drugs - legal opiates, for example. But this would require the 180-plus members that signed on to the convention to agree that such punishment was necessary, and given the changing attitude toward marijuana worldwide, that seems unlikely.
To avoid all that trouble, Uruguay could also just do what Ecuador has already done: leave the convention behind, removing itself from the list of signatories. For now though, Uruguayan officials just plan to ignore it. "Who cares about the UN convention?" said Sebastin Sabini, one of the lawmakers working on the legalization proposal. "It's irrelevant."

"The war failed. Treating it as an economic issue rather than a legal one could deal a fatal blow to the heart of the problem: Price. This would, in turn, dampen the violence associated with black market competition." - 
"The radical measures by Uruguay appear to stem from a sense of hopelessness and desperation. Before taking the leap it would be wise to learn and consult other countries that have legalized the substance and ascertain whether this would indeed arrest the scourge of drug-related crimes and this should also be balanced against the potential health, economic, political and social benefits." - 
Q.
Seeing that the Netherlands legalized marijuana in the 1970s - is there any evidence that violence went down? Was there even violence before in the Netherlands?
A.
The Netherlands did not actually legalize marijuana, it simply decided to depenalize and tolerate the purchase and sale of marijuana in coffee shops. But the question about the effects of that policy is a good one, and it is something that Uruguayan officials are closely watching because the Dutch model itself is evolving. It used to be the case that anyone who visited Amsterdam could enjoy the city's libertine approach to marijuana. Enter a coffee shop, choose between marijuana strains like Hindu Kush or Mellow Yellow, and smoke as much as you want. Crime was negligible, or at least nothing close to the crime levels associated with drugs in the United States during the '70s and '80s, for example.
Over time, however, the local marijuana industry - decriminalized for personal consumption within the Netherlands - became a source of marijuana for people outside of the country. Germans crossed the border to buy and return home, bringing drug sales back to the streets in some cities, and then marijuana producers began to simply sell their product in other countries where prices were higher, in part because the drug was still illegal.
According to this interview with Max Daniel, the head of a police unit charged with investigating organized crime in the Netherlands, demand for Dutch marijuana outside the country now exceeds the amounts sold in coffee shops - about 80 percent of what is grown there ends up exported. As a result, legitimate marijuana growers for coffee shops have a strong incentive to sell to the illegal markets abroad. 
Marijuana is still kept separate from hard drugs like cocaine and heroin, the goal of both Uruguay and the Netherlands, but the marijuana industry is no longer as small and controlled as Dutch officials intended, and that has led to crime. "We know there are shops that bring cannabis-growing equipment directly to people's homes," Mr. Daniel said. "They then provide the names and addresses to criminal organizations, which come and steal the harvest. Today, cannabis is involved in nearly all major cases involving murder, weapons and drugs."
Legalization proponents will no doubt argue that none of this would be happening if the rest of Europe legalized marijuana as well, driving prices down to the levels of the Dutch coffee shops. But with that unlikely anytime soon, the Dutch are trying something else: earlier this year, they passeda new law banning the sale of marijuana to tourists. Officials have said they do not intend to shut down the coffee shops, but they do intend to try and rein in the market for drug tourism. 
How much of an impact that will have on the crime associated with producing and trafficking marijuana to the rest of Europe remains to be seen. But this is very much on the minds of Latin American policy makers. Uruguayan officials plan to keep marijuana sales limited to Uruguayan residents with registration cards - Argentine lawmakers have already started calling to ask about how it would work - and other leaders in Latin America have said they are hesitating to move further and faster toward legalization in part because of the cross-border issues that could develop. Ultimately, this speaks to the challenge of marijuana legalization being done on a country-by-country basis. The question now is whether the new Dutch plan (which also includes registration cards and clubs) will succeed well enough to become a new model, or whether certain regions of Latin America - like Central America, or South America's southern cone - will decide to move together in a single direction.
Q. 
@damiencave Pot legalization is a way to take power from dealers, but what's its revenue % compared to more expensive drugs? #NYTWorldChat - FabioXimenez (@FabioXimenez) July 30, 2012

Si se legalizara marijuana en URY como un producto que el gobierno puede taxiar, otros paises reconsideraran sus posiciones. #NYTWorldChat
- Melanie Berdecia (@Berdeciam) July 30, 2012
A.
All of these comments on Twitter, along with many others, focus on the issue of money. Just how much revenue could Uruguay bring in by legalizing marijuana? How would other industries react, from the alcohol industry to pharmaceutical companies to banks? Many readers, smartly and correctly, recognized that the legalization of marijuana would not be just a question of law, but also one of commerce and economics.
Of course, as with any black market item, it is nearly impossible to get an accurate picture of just how much money is at stake, and how competitors - old ones in the black market and new ones in the legitimate market - might react. But this much is clear: Uruguay, even as a small country, stands to gain a small windfall. Julio Calzada, the country's top drug official, told me he had calculated that the country would need to grow at least 60,000 pounds of marijuana a year to satisfy its regular users. Call it 80,000 because legalization will probably increase consumption, at least initially. So assuming that state-sanctioned production leads to prices that are slightly below black market prices - so around $200 a pound - marijuana legalization would create a $16 million annual industry.
That's a lot of green, but in the context of an economy with a G.D.P. of around $47 billion, it is really not that much. Would established industries like pharmaceutical companies and alcohol sellers bother to create a huge obstacle to the plan? We'll have to wait and see, but resistance so far from the business community has been limited.
And ultimately, the government, which has said it would not grow the marijuana itself but rather use established licensed farmers, would not get rich off the idea either. Taxes of 5 percent on 80,000 pounds would bring in $800,000, for a government's annual expenditures are around $14 million, according to the C.I.A. Factbook. It would be enough to help with treatment, the government has said, but not enough to drastically change the course of government.
Q.
Your article portrays most officials in Uruguay as seeking to separate the marijuana market from those of substances they acknowledge as truly destructive, such as cocaine paste etc. Even in Portugal, drug use has been decriminalized but the substances remain illegal. That would seem to indicate a commitment, in my opinion a smart one, in most or all of these countries to keeping those kinds of more damaging substances illegal to make and sell, even if users are treated better and in smarter ways than just locking them up.
Isn't this all a sign, then, not of a total rejection of the so-called U.S. position - that the damage that certain drugs cause means they should not be allowed to legally be sold - but of a tactical/strategic shift that still maintains that basic premise? Will we then realize that keeping drugs such as heroin, meth and cocaine illegal is not just an imperial American edict but global common sense?
A.
Very astute question. What I think we are seeing is a push for reform on two tracks: one is toward legalization of all drugs, which is a total rejection of the so-called U.S. position; and a move toward going soft on some drugs and hard on others, which is, as you note, more of a shift in emphasis. So in Brazil and Argentina, for example, some lawmakers have called for decriminalization of all drugs, along the lines of Portugal, which decriminalized everything in 2001, moving toward a model based on public health rather than law enforcement. But in Uruguay, officials are looking to get tougher on the sale and use of cocaine paste - possibly extending prison sentences for cocaine trafficking - even as they propose legalization of marijuana. They have said this is because of the violent crime associated with cocaine dealing and use. When I was in Montevideo, I met several young cocaine paste addicts at a treatment center who also said they supported policies that took a harder line with stronger drugs.
This call for more punishment is the case for the same reason that drug laws in the United States became increasingly harsh in the 1980s: fear. Many Uruguayans, especially after a series of violent crimes this spring, have come to see drugs and drug addiction as a scourge that makes the entire country less secure. Even if putting more and more people in jail is expensive, people in Uruguay say they are hopeful that the police will put the right people behind bars: those who are violent, and those who are dealing the drugs.
"The 'drug war' has not worked. Wonderful that those countries affected by the USA lust for drugs are innovative in seeking solutions and to end the violence in their countries." -

It would be enough to help with treatment, the government has said, but not enough to drastically change the course of government.
Q.
Your article portrays most officials in Uruguay as seeking to separate the marijuana market from those of substances they acknowledge as truly destructive, such as cocaine paste etc. Even in Portugal, drug use has been decriminalized but the substances remain illegal. That would seem to indicate a commitment, in my opinion a smart one, in most or all of these countries to keeping those kinds of more damaging substances illegal to make and sell, even if users are treated better and in smarter ways than just locking them up.
Isn't this all a sign, then, not of a total rejection of the so-called U.S. position - that the damage that certain drugs cause means they should not be allowed to legally be sold - but of a tactical/strategic shift that still maintains that basic premise? Will we then realize that keeping drugs such as heroin, meth and cocaine illegal is not just an imperial American edict but global common sense?
A.
Very astute question. What I think we are seeing is a push for reform on two tracks: one is toward legalization of all drugs, which is a total rejection of the so-called U.S. position; and a move toward going soft on some drugs and hard on others, which is, as you note, more of a shift in emphasis. So in Brazil and Argentina, for example, some lawmakers have called for decriminalization of all drugs, along the lines of Portugal, which decriminalized everything in 2001, moving toward a model based on public health rather than law enforcement. But in Uruguay, officials are looking to get tougher on the sale and use of cocaine paste - possibly extending prison sentences for cocaine trafficking - even as they propose legalization of marijuana. They have said this is because of the violent crime associated with cocaine dealing and use. When I was in Montevideo, I met several young cocaine paste addicts at a treatment center who also said they supported policies that took a harder line with stronger drugs.
This call for more punishment is the case for the same reason that drug laws in the United States became increasingly harsh in the 1980s: fear. Many Uruguayans, especially after a series of violent crimes this spring, have come to see drugs and drug addiction as a scourge that makes the entire country less secure. Even if putting more and more people in jail is expensive, people in Uruguay say they are hopeful that the police will put the right people behind bars: those who are violent, and those who are dealing the drugs.
"The 'drug war' has not worked. Wonderful that those countries affected by the USA lust for drugs are innovative in seeking solutions and to end the violence in their countries." -

HIGHLIGHT: Answers to questions on drug policy in Latin America from Damien Cave. 

 BODY:
Thank you - - for sending along your smart, tough questions and comments. I was impressed to see readers contributing (here, on Twitter and on Facebook) from at least a half dozen countries and many parts of the United States, which is proof, perhaps, of how far and wide the debate over drug policy has become.
Clearly, especially in Latin America, there is a growing desire for new ideas as frustration with the war on drugs expands. My article on Uruguay's plans for marijuana legalization offers a close look at just one of the alternative policies being considered, but your questions ranged more broadly to issues of economics and American policy.
This will be an ongoing Q. and A., and this is a topic that I will continue to cover, so please keep asking questions. In the meantime, here are some answers. 
Q.
As Uruguay moves forward with this plan, it is unimaginable that Washington will tolerate it. How far will the U.S. go to maintain marijuana prohibition abroad, and how far will Uruguay go to resist pressure from our country?
A.
There were a lot of questions about the likely American reaction. When it comes to drug policy at home and abroad, the United States is in the midst of what could be seen as either a messy moment of contradiction, or a period of transition. American officials in Washington and around Latin America no longer walk in lockstep, no longer speak only of ridding the world of drugs to stamp out American addiction. Some, especially those in the Drug Enforcement Agency, still insist that because prohibition is the law (worldwide because of United Nations treaties), their job is to enforce the law with as much force as possible. But there are also those who have become more pragmatic, and more accepting of the fact that other countries may want and need to go their own way.
For example, some advocates of marijuana legalization point out that the Obama administration has moved ahead of its predecessors by letting Latin American leaders - at the recent meeting of the Organization of American States - know that American policy makers are at least willing to discuss legalization, even if they remain extremely skeptical that the idea is worth pursuing in the United States. Officials I have interviewed said they mainly need to see some specific proposals that do more than just blame American drug consumption for the regions crime problem; they want Latin American leaders and legalization proponents to explain which drugs would be legalized, over what time period, and how the likely consequences might be managed.
"We are open to listening," the American official said. "We are willing to admit we don't have all the solutions."
In the specific case of Uruguay, there are several reasons why the U.S. would be unlikely to get involved in trying to keep the legalization proposal from becoming law. Part of it is simple geography: Uruguay is far from the United States, and the drugs that pass through there either stay around Montevideo, or go to London or Madrid, not Los Angeles or New York. There is not the same kind of vested interest in Uruguay as there is in, say, Honduras, where cocaine from the Andes often stops before heading north.
Uruguay is also tiny - just a few million people. That means that opening the market to legal marijuana would not necessarily have an enormous impact throughout the region or worldwide. Nor would letting Uruguay smoke up legally have much of an impact on American domestic politics, which is perhaps why some Americans in the drug enforcement business seem mostly curious about the proposal's prospects. For example, when I recently asked some American antidrug officials about it, their response amounted to: "Well, its a small enough country, maybe they can pull it off."
The bigger challenge may be with the United Nations. Officials with the U.N. made clear to me that Uruguay's plan, if it became law, would be a clear violation of the 1961 Convention that made marijuana a level one substance deserving of prohibition. At the far end of the spectrum, U.N. officials said, that could open the country up to sanctions that would keep Uruguay from being allowed to distribute certain pharmaceutical drugs - legal opiates, for example. But this would require the 180-plus members that signed on to the convention to agree that such punishment was necessary, and given the changing attitude toward marijuana worldwide, that seems unlikely.
To avoid all that trouble, Uruguay could also just do what Ecuador has already done: leave the convention behind, removing itself from the list of signatories. For now though, Uruguayan officials just plan to ignore it. "Who cares about the UN convention?" said Sebastin Sabini, one of the lawmakers working on the legalization proposal. "It's irrelevant."

"The war failed. Treating it as an economic issue rather than a legal one could deal a fatal blow to the heart of the problem: Price. This would, in turn, dampen the violence associated with black market competition." - 
"The radical measures by Uruguay appear to stem from a sense of hopelessness and desperation. Before taking the leap it would be wise to learn and consult other countries that have legalized the substance and ascertain whether this would indeed arrest the scourge of drug-related crimes and this should also be balanced against the potential health, economic, political and social benefits." - 
Q.
Seeing that the Netherlands legalized marijuana in the 1970s - is there any evidence that violence went down? Was there even violence before in the Netherlands?
A.
The Netherlands did not actually legalize marijuana, it simply decided to depenalize and tolerate the purchase and sale of marijuana in coffee shops. But the question about the effects of that policy is a good one, and it is something that Uruguayan officials are closely watching because the Dutch model itself is evolving. It used to be the case that anyone who visited Amsterdam could enjoy the city's libertine approach to marijuana. Enter a coffee shop, choose between marijuana strains like Hindu Kush or Mellow Yellow, and smoke as much as you want. Crime was negligible, or at least nothing close to the crime levels associated with drugs in the United States during the '70s and '80s, for example.
Over time, however, the local marijuana industry - decriminalized for personal consumption within the Netherlands - became a source of marijuana for people outside of the country. Germans crossed the border to buy and return home, bringing drug sales back to the streets in some cities, and then marijuana producers began to simply sell their product in other countries where prices were higher, in part because the drug was still illegal.
According to this interview with Max Daniel, the head of a police unit charged with investigating organized crime in the Netherlands, demand for Dutch marijuana outside the country now exceeds the amounts sold in coffee shops - about 80 percent of what is grown there ends up exported. As a result, legitimate marijuana growers for coffee shops have a strong incentive to sell to the illegal markets abroad. 
Marijuana is still kept separate from hard drugs like cocaine and heroin, the goal of both Uruguay and the Netherlands, but the marijuana industry is no longer as small and controlled as Dutch officials intended, and that has led to crime. "We know there are shops that bring cannabis-growing equipment directly to people's homes," Mr. Daniel said. "They then provide the names and addresses to criminal organizations, which come and steal the harvest. Today, cannabis is involved in nearly all major cases involving murder, weapons and drugs."
Legalization proponents will no doubt argue that none of this would be happening if the rest of Europe legalized marijuana as well, driving prices down to the levels of the Dutch coffee shops. But with that unlikely anytime soon, the Dutch are trying something else: earlier this year, they passeda new law banning the sale of marijuana to tourists. Officials have said they do not intend to shut down the coffee shops, but they do intend to try and rein in the market for drug tourism. 
How much of an impact that will have on the crime associated with producing and trafficking marijuana to the rest of Europe remains to be seen. But this is very much on the minds of Latin American policy makers. Uruguayan officials plan to keep marijuana sales limited to Uruguayan residents with registration cards - Argentine lawmakers have already started calling to ask about how it would work - and other leaders in Latin America have said they are hesitating to move further and faster toward legalization in part because of the cross-border issues that could develop. Ultimately, this speaks to the challenge of marijuana legalization being done on a country-by-country basis. The question now is whether the new Dutch plan (which also includes registration cards and clubs) will succeed well enough to become a new model, or whether certain regions of Latin America - like Central America, or South America's southern cone - will decide to move together in a single direction.

A.
All of these comments on Twitter, along with many others, focus on the issue of money. Just how much revenue could Uruguay bring in by legalizing marijuana? How would other industries react, from the alcohol industry to pharmaceutical companies to banks? Many readers, smartly and correctly, recognized that the legalization of marijuana would not be just a question of law, but also one of commerce and economics.
Of course, as with any black market item, it is nearly impossible to get an accurate picture of just how much money is at stake, and how competitors - old ones in the black market and new ones in the legitimate market - might react. But this much is clear: Uruguay, even as a small country, stands to gain a small windfall. Julio Calzada, the country's top drug official, told me he had calculated that the country would need to grow at least 60,000 pounds of marijuana a year to satisfy its regular users. Call it 80,000 because legalization will probably increase consumption, at least initially. So assuming that state-sanctioned production leads to prices that are slightly below black market prices - so around $200 a pound - marijuana legalization would create a $16 million annual industry.
That's a lot of green, but in the context of an economy with a G.D.P. of around $47 billion, it is really not that much. Would established industries like pharmaceutical companies and alcohol sellers bother to create a huge obstacle to the plan? We'll have to wait and see, but resistance so far from the business community has been limited.
And ultimately, the government, which has said it would not grow the marijuana itself but rather use established licensed farmers, would not get rich off the idea either. Taxes of 5 percent on 80,000 pounds would bring in $800,000, for a government's annual expenditures are around $14 million, according to the C.I.A. Factbook.

HEADLINE: As Profit Plunges, Deutsche Bank to Slash Jobs

BYLINE: JACK EWING


HIGHLIGHT: Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest lender, said Tuesday it would slash jobs in its investment banking division after plunge plunged in the second quarter amid the European sovereign debt crisis. 

 BODY:
FRANKFURT-- Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest lender, said Tuesday it would slash jobs in its investment banking division after profit plunged in the second quarter amid the European sovereign debt crisis.
The bank, the subject of several official probes related to its activities in the United States and other countries, also said it was reviewing its compensation practices and its internal code of conduct "as part of a range of measures to bring about a cultural change."
"We are firmly convinced that the industry must change its compensation model, and we are determined to be in the forefront," Anshu Jain, who shares chief executive duties with Jrgen Fitschen, said during a conference call with analysts.
 The cost-saving measures are the most visible sign of change at the bank since Mr. Fitschen and Mr. Jain took over as co-chief executives in May, replacing Josef Ackermann, who had held the post for a decade. The moves reflect the pressures faced by many investment banks in Europe and the United States both from government authorities and market conditions.
The investment banking unit, which Mr. Jain ran until his promotion to chief executive, will bear the brunt of job cuts, which that the bank said would save 350 million euros annually. Of 1,900 job cuts, 1,500 will be in investment banking.
The investment bank weighed heavily on the bank's earnings, which dropped 46 percent during the second quarter, to 661 million euros, or $811 million. The investment banking division, which had been the most profitable unit until recently, suffered a 63 percent decline in pretax profit, to 357 million euros, the bank said. 
The bank attributed the sag in profit and revenue to "a volatile environment."
"The European sovereign debt crisis continues to weigh on investor confidence and client activity across the bank," Mr. Jain and Mr. Fitschen said in a statement.
Deutsche Bank reported approximate earnings for the quarter last week, but gave more detail Tuesday.
Like its peers, Deutsche Bank is suffering from a broad decline in investment banking revenue as well as regulatory pressure to reduce risk-taking. Mr. Jain moved Tuesday to address criticism that the bank's capital cushion, though within regulatory limits, is thin. He said the bank would further reduce risk and raise capital to meet stricter requirements known as Basel III, and did not rule out selling new shares to do so - a step that would dilute the value of existing shares.
Deutsche Bank "aims to apply all capital levers at its disposal before considering raising equity from investors," the bank said.
Pretax profit at Deutsche Bank's retail banking operations, including its network of branches in Germany, fell 13 percent to 398 million euros. The German economy, which has been less affected by the debt crisis, has helped make retail banking a more reliable source of profit than investment banking.
The bank reiterated that a decline in the euro compared to the dollar led to an increase in operating expenses that also hurt profit. Bank revenue fell 6 percent to 8 billion euros.
Mr. Jain rejected calls by some people, including Sanford I. Weill, the former chief executive of Citigroup, to split banks' risky investment banking activities from other businesses such as issuing loans.
"We re-affirm our commitment to the universal banking model," Mr. Jain told analysts.

TOP STORIES 
Suggestions for an Apple Shopping List | Question: What would you do if you had $117 billion? That's the challenge facing Tim Cook, Apple's chief, whose company's cash hoard keeps growing - by about $1 billion a week.
He could hold onto it. He could increase Apple's dividend, which he instituted this year for the first time. Or he could spend it, Andrew Ross Sorkin writes in the DealBook column.
Just last week, Mr. Cook acquired AuthenTec, a mobile security company, for $356 million in cash - a price equal to pocket lint for a company with the war chest the size of Apple's. The real question is whether Mr. Cook would ever spend Apple's money on an "elephant" - Wall Street parlance for a huge deal.
Apple denizens often say that the company is not interested in deal making. It has, after all, invented some of today's most successful consumer products. But that view misunderstands Apple's history: some of its most important innovations were not invented within Apple; they were purchased from other companies.

Tiger Management Helps Next Generation of Funds | When a top hedge fund manager donated money to start a student-run portfolio at the University of Virginia in 1994, Richard Gerson was one of the few undergraduates to earn a spot managing the six-figure portfolio.
It was the first connection of many that paved his way to the upper echelons of the hedge fund industry.
Mr. Gerson parlayed his college experience into an internship at Tiger Management, the vaunted hedge fund firm run by Julian Robertson. He then helped John Griffin, a top deputy of Mr. Robertson and the sponsor of the investment club, start Blue Ridge Capital.
Now, Mr. Gerson, 37, is building a new firm. Mr. Gerson and his business partner, Navroz D. Udwadia, have raised $1.2 billion for Falcon Edge Capital, according to people with knowledge of the matter. At a time when investors are reluctant to hand over money to unproven managers, Falcon Edge is the hedge fund equivalent of a high first-round draft pick.

HEADLINE: China Assails U.S. 'Arrogance' in Report on Religious Freedom

BYLINE: MARK MCDONALD


HIGHLIGHT: The United States has issued its annual report on religious freedom around the world, taking particular aim at repression and crackdowns in China, North Korea and Myanmar. China shot back that the report was "full of prejudice, arrogance and ignorance." 

 BODY:
HONG KONG - The United States has issued its annual report on religious freedom around the world, taking particular aim at repression and crackdowns in China, North Korea and Myanmar. China shot back that the report was "full of prejudice, arrogance and ignorance."
"More than a billion people live under governments that systematically suppress religious freedom," Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said in remarks summarizing the new report. 
"New technologies have given repressive governments additional tools for cracking down on religious expression," Mrs. Clinton said. "Members of faith communities that have long been under pressure report that the pressure is rising."
In terms of religious freedom as a human right, she said, "the world is sliding backwards."
#SecClinton: We will continue to advocate for religious freedom. This is a bedrock priority of our foreign policy. go.usa.gov/G1Y
- StateDept (@StateDept) July 31, 2012
The report noted a rising tide of anti-Semitism around the world, "manifested in Holocaust denial, glorification, and relativism; conflating opposition to certain policies of Israel with blatant anti-Semitism; growing nationalistic movements that target 'the other'; and traditional forms of anti-Semitism, such as conspiracy theories, acts of desecration and assault, 'blood libel,' and cartoons demonizing Jews."
Four Asian countries - China, Myanmar, North Korea and Uzbekistan - were among eight nations designated by the State Department as "countries of particular concern" on religious freedom. 
The China section of the new report found "a marked deterioration during 2011 in the government's respect for and protection of religious freedom." 
It cited tightened restrictions on Buddhist clergy and worship in Tibet and Tibetan areas, saying, "Official interference in the practice of these religious traditions exacerbated grievances and contributed to at least 12 self-immolations by Tibetans in 2011."
From the report's separate section on Tibet: "There were numerous and severe abuses of religious freedom, including religious prisoners and detainees. Monasteries were increasingly forbidden to deliver traditional educational and medical services to the people of their communities, and official intimidation was used to compel acquiescence and preserve a facade of stability."
Beijing continued to "severely repress Muslims" living in the Xinjiang region, and there were further crackdowns on Christian house churches, according to the report. 
China issued a biting response on Tuesday, saying the U.S. report continued "a notorious practice of blatantly interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, including China, in the name of religion." A slightly condensed excerpt from the response, published as a commentary by the official news agency Xinhua:
The annual report, largely based on unconfirmed media reports and groundless allegations from outlawed groups and organizations with ulterior motives, is nothing but a political tool used by the U.S. government to exert pressure on other countries, mostly deemed as its rivals.
The U.S. practice of releasing such a report, which is full of prejudice, arrogance and ignorance, is unimaginative and even counterproductive.
Only a few members from banned cults and illegal extremist religious organizations, which engage in illegal or splittist activities under the guise of seeking religious freedom, have been punished in China strictly according to the laws.
Falun Gong followers - there are said to be tens of millions of believers in China - were said to be especially targeted for harassment and even detention in high-security psychiatric facilities for the criminally insane, although the report acknowledged that such charges were difficult to verify.
"Some neighborhood communities reportedly were instructed to report on Falun Gong members to officials; monetary rewards were offered to citizens who informed on Falun Gong practitioners," the report said. 
The report noted that China's central government "stated that it did not detain or arrest anyone solely because of his or her religion."
The report found encouraging signs in China, too. Three Catholic bishops were ordained in 2011, "with the approval of both the Vatican and the official Chinese Catholic church." Church groups were encouraged to provide social services in quake-hit areas of Sichuan Province. 
In its assessment of North Korea, the U.S. report acknowledged that "little is known about the day-to-day life of religious persons in the country." An excerpt:
Members of government-controlled religious groups did not appear to suffer discrimination, while members of underground churches or those connected to missionary activities were reportedly regarded as subversive elements. Some reports claimed, and circumstantial evidence suggested, that many if not most of the government-controlled religious organizations were created for propaganda and political purposes, including meeting with foreign religious visitors.
Some NGOs and academics estimated there may be up to several hundred thousand Christians practicing their faith underground in the country. Others questioned the existence of a large-scale underground church or concluded that it was impossible to estimate accurately the number of underground religious believers. Individual underground congregations were reportedly very small and typically confined to private homes.
Washington has welcomed recent political reforms in Myanmar, the former Burma, and Mrs. Clinton seems to have connected personally with the opposition leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. And the State Department noted the passage of "the first law in several decades to allow peaceful assembly."
But the report also cited ongoing and widespread abuses of religious freedoms, from arbitrary arrests of Muslims to the harassment of Baptists.
Traditional Christian and Islamic holidays continued to be controlled by the authorities, the report said. Permits to build or repair mosques were said to be rarely granted; Muslims living in Rakhine State often needed to pay bribes to get permission to travel for any purpose; and ethnic Rohingya Muslims "continued to experience the severest forms of legal, economic, educational, and social discrimination."
An excerpt from the Myanmar report:
The government continued its efforts to exert control over the Buddhist clergy (Sangha). It tried Sangha members for "activities inconsistent with and detrimental to Buddhism" and imposed on the Sangha a code of conduct enforced by criminal penalties. 
The government continued the detention, imprisonment, and interrogation of politically active Buddhist monks. In prison, some monks were defrocked and treated as laypersons. In general they were not allowed to shave their heads and were not given food compatible with the monastic code, which dictates that monks should not eat after noon. They often were beaten and forced to do hard labor.
The State Department's report on religion is separate from its annual assessment of human rights, which was published in May. 
It is also not to be confused with another report, also recently issued, by the independent federal panel known as the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom.

 BODY:
Julin Castro, the Democratic mayor of San Antonio, will deliver the keynote speech at his party's national convention in September, taking the role that vaulted Barack Obama to national prominence eight years ago.
Mr. Castro will become the first Hispanic American chosen for the high-profile speaking slot at a time when President Obama is counting on Latinos to help him win a second term in the White House.
The selection was announced by Mr. Castro himself in a video posted by convention organizers and reported first by Univision. 
"I know I've got some big shoes to fill," Mr. Castro says in the three-minute video. "We've come so far over the past three and a half years under Obama's leadership. And I know he's not done yet. We got a lot more work to do."
A co-chairman of Mr. Obama's re-election campaign, Mr. Castro is a rising star in the Democratic Party who, at 37, has already been elected and re-elected to the top job in San Antonio.
Mr. Castro's Mexican-American background will provide Mr. Obama and the Democrats an opportunity to highlight what they see as a stark contrast with the policies of Mitt Romney and the Republican Party when it comes to Latino issues.
And the speech could serve as a national introduction for Mr. Castro as he pursues a political career outside of Texas.
In the video released Tuesday morning, Mr. Castro previewed the kind of personal story that he will draw upon during his remarks at the convention in Charlotte, N.C. Mr. Castro recalled Mr. Obama's 2004 keynote speech and said he hoped to have the same effect.
"I remember watching his speech in 2004 and being inspired," Mr. Castro said. "When Obama talked about the audacity of hope, I thought back to my mother saying if you didn't like the way things were, you could dare to change them. I thought, my mother would like this guy."
Mr. Castro's home state of Texas is not a political battleground in the presidential campaign and will almost certainly be firmly in Mr. Romney's column in the fall. 
But the two candidates are waging fierce fights in Colorado, Florida, Nevada and Virginia - states where the increasing numbers of Latino voters make them an important voting block.
Democrats have said for years that they believe the tough Republican position on illegal immigration will make it more difficult for national politicians like Mr. Romney to earn Latino votes. Picking Mr. Castro for the prominent speaking post is one way of highlighting that issue for voters in those swing states.
Mr. Romney has argued that the nation's economic distress is affecting Latinos even more deeply than other Americans, and that many of them will turn toward Republicans after concluding that Mr. Obama's policies have not worked.
In the video, Mr. Castro argues that Mr. Obama faced a deep economic crisis and has begun to turn things around for all Americans.
"He brought the economy back from the brink, rescued the auto industry while Mitt Romney argued that we should let Detroit go bankrupt, and he created 4.4 million private sector jobs," Mr. Castro said.

HEADLINE: Romney Lauds Poland as an Economic Model

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney spoke Tuesday afternoon in Poland, the third stop on his seven-day foreign trip. 

 BODY:
WARSAW - Mitt Romney delivered a lyrical speech here in Warsaw on Tuesday afternoon, lauding Poland as a model for other nations in the throes of economic uncertainty. 
Comparing current day Poland to the Poland of the 1980s served, Mr. Romney explained, as an example of a country successfully facing down political tyranny. Mr. Romney said that, "today, as some wonder about the way forward out of economic recession and fiscal crisis, the answer once again is to 'Look to Poland.' "
Poland's economy expanded by 4.3 percent last year, far outpacing many of its counterparts in European Union, and after the United States and Afghanistan, the country has committed the third highest number of troops to the war in Afghanistan. 
"In a turbulent world, Poland stands as an example and a defender of freedom," Mr. Romney said. "I, and my fellow Americans, are inspired by the path of freedom tread by the people of Poland."
Though Mr. Romney frequently makes Europe a foil of his domestic stump speech, warning voters that they do not want to head down a path to becoming a "social welfare state," Mr. Romney praised Poland as an example of a nation on the rise.
"The world should pay close attention to the transformation of Poland's economy," Mr. Romney said. "A march toward economic liberty and smaller government has meant a march toward higher living standards, a strong military that defends liberty at home and abroad, and an important and growing role on the international stage."
Poland was the third stop of Mr. Romney's seven-day foreign trip, in which his campaign took to pains to visit countries for which Mr. Romney could express strong support. He started in the United Kingdom, extolling the "special relationship" between the two countries, moved onto Israel, where he expressed his belief that the country has a right to defend itself against the threat of a nuclear Iran, and finished up Tuesday in Poland.
"I believe it is critical to stand by those who have stood by America," Mr. Romney said. "Solidarity was a great movement that freed a nation. And it is with solidarity that America and Poland face the future."
Mr. Romney also used his speech in Poland to pay his respect to Pope John Paul II, a likely appeal to Catholic voters back in the United States.

HEADLINE: 24 Hour Fitness Is Said to Be on the Block

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Forstmann Little, the private equity firm that owns 24 Hour Fitness, has hired Goldman Sachs to&#160;run an auction that is expected to fetch&#160;about $2 billion, say people briefed on the matter. 

 BODY:
The health club chain 24 Hour Fitness is for sale, people briefed on the matter said on Tuesday.
 
Forstmann Little, the private equity firm that owns 24 Hour Fitness, has hired Goldman Sachs to run the auction process, these people said. Goldman will soon begin soliciting interest from potential buyers, a group that includes other fitness chains and private equity firms. 
24 Hour Fitness is expected to fetch about $2 billion in a sale, said these people, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the deal publicly. 
With about 425 locations, 24 Hour Fitness is the nation's largest privately owned chain of fitness centers. A representative of the company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
 
Forstmann Little's eventual sale of 24 Hour Fitness was expected. Once one of the world's largest private equity funds, Forstmann Little began winding down its operations several years ago after ill-timed telecommunications investments. Theodore J. Forstmann, the billionaire financier who led the firm, died last November at the age of 71.
 
24 Hour Fitness is one of the two major investments remaining in Forstmann Little's portfolio. The other is IMG, the sports, fashion and media company. Forstmann Little is also expected to pursue a sale of IMG sometime next year.
 
The Forstmann Little fund formally expired on June 30, 2012, meaning that it was contractually required to sell its assets and return all money to its investors by then. But the firm's investors -- called limited partners in private equity parlance -- had allowed that deadline to lapse and granted the fund extra time to sell 24 Hour Fitness and IMG. 
 
After Mr. Forstmann's death, Forstman Little named the hedge fund manager Julian H. Robertson as its chairman. He, along with Mark J. MacDougall, a lawyer at Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld, have been overseeing the sale of the firm's remaining assets.
 
Health club chains have been attractive acquisition targets for private equity firms because their membership fees generate predictable cash flows that they can use to pay off the debt taken on to pay for the company. The New York-based chain Equinox, for example, was owned by North Castle Partners and J.W. Childs before it was sold to the real estate developer Related Companies.
 
Other potential buyers of 24 Hour Fitness include LA Fitness, a chain of health clubs partially owned by the private equity firm Madison Dearborn, and Lifetime Fitness, a publicly traded company. 
Forstmann Little acquired 24 Hour Fitness in 2005 for $1.6 billion. The company's financial results suffered during the recession, but have since improved. In recent years the company has expanded internationally, opening several outposts in Asia.
San Ramon, Calif.-based 24 Hour Fitness was started in 1983 by Mark S. Mastrov, a former natural-foods salesman, with a single club. Today, the company sponsors the United States Olympic team and at the London Games has several athletes on its "Team 24" squad, including the beach volleyball star Kerri Walsh and the water polo captain Tony Azevedo.

HEADLINE: Pennsylvania Flaunts Its Importance

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: On this last day of July, at least, our forecasts show Pennsylvania -- a "tipping point state" -- won't be easy for Mitt Romney to win in November. But the Romney campaign cannot ignore it. 

 BODY:
As The New Republic's Nate Cohn has observed, the presidential campaigns -- especially Mitt Romney's -- have spent conspicuously little in advertising in a state that is traditionally regarded as one of the keys to the election, Pennsylvania.
This could reflect some tactical quirk -- one campaign trying to lull the other into a false sense of security, for instance.
But assume for the moment that Mr. Romney's campaign has decided that Pennsylvania is not a fruitful path to electoral victory. Is this a sensible conclusion? Personally, I don't think so. 
Pennsylvania won't be the easiest state for Mr. Romney to win. As of Monday, our forecast model gave him only about a 20 percent chance of doing so. And there are some disadvantages to his trying to compete there.
First, it's hard to move votes in Pennsylvania. Between blacks (and college students) in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh on the one hand, and the culturally conservative voters in central Pennsylvania on the other, a lot of the votes there are preordained. There are certainly some swing voters in the Philadelphia and Pittsburgh suburbs, but in general the demographics of the state make turnout there a bit more important than persuasion. 
Second, the polls have been more consistent in Pennsylvania than in states like Michigan and Wisconsin. Mr. Obama has led each of the last 16 polls in Pennsylvania, but his margin was in the single digits in all but one of them. Greater consistency in polling also reduces the uncertainty in the forecast.
Nevertheless, our model classifies Pennsylvania as a "tipping point state," which could conceivably be decisive in the electoral outcome. In fact, it ranked Pennsylvania as the second-most important state as of Monday.
There are two cases in which Pennsylvania could be an important state for Mr. Romney. One case is if he loses Ohio -- and the other if he wins it.
Each day, our model runs a series of Electoral College simulations. Typically, we run 25,001 (the odd number is so that there are no exact ties), but I ran 50,001 on Monday to explore all the different permutations in a bit more depth.
The simulations evaluate the uncertainty in the outcome in each state, and how the states are related to one another. They consider the fact that some states are more similar to one another demographically, and therefore are more likely to move in tandem. They also consider that other factors, like a rising or falling economic tide, is likely to have some effect in all states.
From our set of 50,001 simulations, I looked for cases in which the following conditions held:
1) Mr. Romney won the Electoral College;
2) And, Mr. Romney won Pennsylvania;
3) However, it was close enough that Mr. Romney would have lost the election had he lost Pennsylvania's 20 electoral votes. 
That is, these are cases where Mr. Romney won with somewhere between 269 electoral votes (an exact tie, but the model resolves most of these cases for Mr. Romney since Republicans are likely to control more delegations in the incoming Congress in the event that the 12th Amendment is invoked) and 288 -- and with Pennsylvania in hand.
How often did these cases come up? Not very often -- only about 450 times out of the 50,000 simulations, or just shy of 1 percent of the time.
But it's important to consider the context. First, the model sees Mr. Romney as an underdog, albeit not an overwhelming one, to win the election. Second, some of the time that Mr. Romney does win the election, it will be in a blowout. 
So, this might seem like a marginal case -- but the electoral math matters only at the margin as well. There were only about 4,000 simulations in which Mr. Romney won the Electoral College by such a narrow margin. Compared to that, the 450 cases out of 4,000 in which Pennsylvania proved to be decisive are not trivial.
I then looked up the most common permutations of wins and losses in each state among these 450 cases. The three most common situations all involved Mr. Romney winning Pennsylvania as a substitute of sorts for Ohio:
How plausible is it that Mr. Romney could lose Ohio but win Pennsylvania? It isn't all that likely: Ohio is typically just slightly Republican-leaning, and Pennsylvania is normally Democratic-leaning by two or three points.
Moreover, the two states have broadly similar demographics -- it's hard to move votes in one state without affecting them in the other -- something which the model considers.
Still, there's enough uncertainty in the forecast that the case of Pennsylvania proving decisive should not be ruled out. 
It's plausible, for instance, that Mr. Romney's opposition to the auto bailout will be more of a disadvantage in Ohio than in Pennsylvania, since the former state relies more on auto industry jobs. Meanwhile, the new voter identification laws in Pennsylvania could give Mr. Romney an extra point or two there, if they're upheld by the courts.
Mr. Romney will be in fairly bad shape if he loses Ohio. But conditional upon that, Pennsylvania might be his least-bad alternative to pick up the requisite number of electoral votes. Wisconsin and Michigan, for instance, might seem like compelling alternatives -- but they are typically a bit more Democratic-leaning that Pennsylvania, and Mr. Romney's polls have been no better in them on the whole.
If Mr. Romney's standing rebounds in Ohio -- or if the polls suggesting he's in trouble there are wrong begin with -- he could rely on a Keystone-Buckeye parlay. For instance, if Mr. Romney won both Ohio and Pennsylvania, that might suffice for him to win the election despite being swept in the competitive states of the Mountain West, like Colorado and Nevada.
In fact, if Mr. Romney won both Pennsylvania and Ohio, he could afford to lose not just Colorado and Nevada (and New Mexico), but also Virginia. The map you see below is a winning one for Mr. Romney, 273 electoral votes to 265.
In other words, the best defense could be a good offense. If Mr. Romney locks down both Ohio and Pennsylvania, then Mr. Obama obviously has few winning maps. 
To be sure, the question of how a campaign ought to allocate its resources is not straightforward. Our model's simulations, I hope, do a reasonably good job of articulating the uncertainty in the forecast, and the relationship in the vote in different states. But they are built from historical data. If the campaigns adopt different tactics than past ones did (for instance, concentrating on a narrower range of states), they could make its empirical analysis less meaningful to the 2012 election.
Still, even if Mr. Romney's campaign has reason to believe that Pennsylvania is not quite at the electoral tipping point, that does not necessarily mean that they should pull out of it. Expending some resources there would force Mr. Obama's campaign to do the same. The state is certainly close enough -- and it has been important enough historically -- that neither campaign can really afford to call the other's bluff. 
Interestingly, in the waning days of the 2008 campaign, John McCain's campaign concluded that Pennsylvania was its best shot of defusing Mr. Obama's path to victory, and concentrated many of its resources there. Whether this was a good strategy is hard to say -- the McCain campaign had a lot of bad options.
But we're still in July -- at least for a few more hours. Adopting such triage strategies is premature, especially in a state that has normally been so important to winning elections.

HEADLINE: If It Works in Israel...

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney praised Israel's health care system yesterday. Does he know about our ally's individual requirement? 

 BODY:
During his trip to London, Mitt Romney insulted his hosts by questioning their Olympic preparedness. He did not make the same mistake in Israel (which no presidential aspirant of either party would dare criticize). At a breakfast fundraiser in Jerusalem on Monday, he had nothing but nice things to say about our ally. But in flattering Israel, he raised more doubts about his political abilities than in disparaging Great Britain.
As I mentioned yesterday, he said that Israelis are wealthier than Palestinians due to cultural differences. A senior aide to Mahmoud Abbas called that suggestion "racist," and bloggers everywhere wondered 

As I didn't mention, he also praised Israel's health care system. "Do you realize what health care spending is as a percentage of the GDP in Israel?" he asked. "Eight percent. You spend eight percent of GDP on health care. You're a pretty healthy nation. We spend 18 percent of our GDP on health care, 10 percentage points more . We have to find ways - not just to provide health care to more people, but to find ways to fund and manage our health care costs." Bloggers everywhere wondered, 
I really would like to know if Mr. Romney- who as governor of Massachusetts passed a healthcare bill including an individual mandate before suggesting the president adopt the idea for the country before promising to "get rid of Obamacare"-bothered to research Israel's system. Because as Think Progress noted, "every Israeli citizen has the obligation to purchase health care services through one of the country's four HMOs since government officials approved the National Health Insurance Law in 1995." Moreover, Israelis "pay 40 percent of their HMO's costs through income-related contributed collected through the tax system, and the state pays the remaining 60 percent."
If Mr. Romney's serious about finding ways "not just to provide health care to more people, but to find ways to fund and manage our health care costs," he could start by endorsing the Affordable Care Act-a more market-oriented version of the Israeli system, which (as even Mr. Romney admits) works quite well.

HEADLINE: Former Citigroup Manager Cleared in Mortgage Securities Case

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The Securities and Exchange Commission lost its lawsuit against Brian Stoker, who was accused of negligence in preparing sales materials for a C.D.O. But the jury also sought to reassure the agency in an unusual post-verdict statement. 

 BODY:
A federal jury on Tuesday cleared a Citigroup executive of wrongdoing in connection with the bank's sale of risky mortgage-related investments at the peak of the housing boom, dealing a blow to the government's effort to hold Wall Street executives accountable for their conduct during the financial crisis.
The Securities and Exchange Commission had accused Brian Stoker, a former midlevel Citigroup executive, with negligence related to his role in creating exotic mortgage securities known as collateralized debt obligations, or C.D.O.'s. In a lawsuit filed last October, the government said that Mr. Stoker, who prepared sales materials for C.D.O.'s, knew or should have known that he was misleading investors by not disclosing that Citigroup helped select the underlying mortgage securities in the C.D.O. and then placed a large bet against it.
The jury rejected the S.E.C.'s case, concluding that Mr. Stoker was not liable under the securities laws. In addition to handing up its verdict, the jury also issued an unusual statement.
 "This verdict should not deter the S.E.C. from investigating the financial industry, to review current regulations and modify existing regulations as necessary," said the jury's statement, which was read aloud in the courtroom by Judge Jed S. Rakoff, who presided over the two-week trial in Federal District Court in Manhattan.
The statement appeared to echo frustration felt by many Americans that Wall Street executives had not been held responsible for its questionable actions leading up to the financial crisis, and that financial industry reform had thus far been inadequate.
In his own statement, Robert Khuzami, the S.E.C.'s director of enforcement, appeared to take the jury's message to heart.
"We respect the jury's verdict and will continue to aggressively pursue misconduct arising out of the financial crisis," he said.
The S.E.C. had filed separate civil fraud charges against Citigroup in connection with the C.D.O. deal, but none of the bank's senior managers were named in the lawsuit. Mr. Stoker was the only individual Citigroup executive charged in the case.
Mr. Stoker's lawyer, John W. Keker, had depicted his client as a scapegoat for Wall Street wrongdoing. While decrying the "high-stakes, high-level gambling" that banks had engaged in during the housing boom, Mr. Keker urged the jury to set aside any distaste that it had for the financial industry's dubious behavior and the complex mortgage securities that it concocted. He also emphasized that Mr. Stoker was a relatively junior executive whose actions were ordered by his bosses.
"It's not the bank or the transaction that's on trial here," Mr. Keker said in his closing argument. "It's Brian Stoker."
As Mr. Stoker prepared for trial, his former employer agreed to pay $285 million to settle a civil complaint brought by the S.E.C. related to the same deal. But Judge Rakoff rejected that settlement. Calling the amount of money Citigroup had agreed to pay "pocket change" for the bank, he said the settlement deprived the public "of ever knowing the truth in a matter of obvious public importance."
Both the S.E.C. and Citigroup appealed Judge Rakoff's rejection of the settlement. In March, a federal appeals court ruled that Judge Rakoff might have overstepped his authority in scuttling the deal.
Danielle Romero-Apsilos, a Citigroup spokeswoman, said the bank agreed with the jury's verdict and hoped "to secure final judicial approval of our settlement with the S.E.C. and put this matter behind us."
The trial of Mr. Stoker served as a referendum on a questionable practice that became common in the run-up to the housing market's collapse: selling clients complex securities tied to mortgages while simultaneously betting against those same securities.
As real estate prices peaked in the middle of the last decade, Citigroup and other banks dived headlong into C.D.O.'s, bundles of mortgage securities pooled together and sold to investors who wanted to benefit from the housing boom. At the same time, another group of investors had a negative view of the housing market and wanted to bet against these C.D.O.'s.
Citigroup decided to play both sides of the trade. Mr. Stoker helped create a $1 billion C.D.O. structure - which was called Class V Funding III - that it sold to a group of sophisticated investors, including the bond insurer Ambac Financial Group and Koch Global Capital, an investment vehicle controlled by the billionaire Koch brothers.
The S.E.C. contended that Citigroup also used the deal to make a $500 million bet against the housing market. Citigroup secretly stuffed the C.D.O. with toxic mortgages that the bank thought would lose value and then took the opposite view of its clients. And Mr. Stoker negligently failed to include this information in the C.D.O.'s marketing materials, the government said.
"Citigroup stacked the deck and Brian Stoker dealt the cards," said Jeffrey Infelise, a lawyer for the S.E.C., during his closing statement.
Lawyers for Mr. Stoker presented evidence that Citigroup's marketing materials for the C.D.O. contained warnings that the investment was especially risky and disclosed that Citigroup might bet against the security. Mr. Stoker's lawyers also argued that Credit Suisse, the bank that Citigroup brought in to serve as a manager of the C.D.O., did its own homework on the underlying securities.
Mr. Stoker, who in 2007 was paid about $2.4 million by Citigroup, left the bank in 2008.

HEADLINE: The Palin Effect

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: With his vice presidential pick looming, will Mitt Romney stir things up or play it safe? 

 BODY:
Sarah Palin may have done wonders for Tina Fey, MSNBC's ratings and the reality-television industry in general, but she's made this year's Republican veepstakes vastly less interesting to handicap. The fear of repeating a Palin-style choice, a gamble that worked out badly for both members of 2008's Republican ticket, has dramatically shortened the plausible list of Mitt Romney's running mates.
It is highly unlikely, for instance, that the presumptive Republican nominee will select either of his party's most promising female officeholders, New Hampshire Senator Kelly Ayotte and New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez, because both have less than two years of political experience in statewide office, and the parallels with the Palin pick would probably dominate the news coverage at the outset.
It's also unlikely that Romney will go with Marco Rubio of Florida, darling of the right and Great Hispanic Hope though he may be, because of basically similar considerations. Rubio is light on experience and relatively new to the national stage, and even though the various controversies in his past - over his credit card expenditures as a Florida officeholder, over the way his Web site described his parent's departure from Cuba, over his friendship with a Florida congressman who's been investigated by the I.R.S. - mostly look like pseudoscandals, there are enough of them to spook a campaign wary of a replay of the McCain campaign's Troopergate headaches.
The memory of the way Palin's star tended to eclipse McCain's even when she wasn't "going rogue," meanwhile, has probably reduced Romney's appetite for picking a mercurial, celebrity-like figure. Hence the long odds against New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who might otherwise have been an obvious pick, and the even longer odds against the perpetually underestimated (though not, one assumes, by veterans of Romney's 2008 campaign) Mike Huckabee, who might otherwise have been an interesting dark horse choice.
Scratch off all of these names, as well as implausible alleged contenders like Condoleezza Rice (whose selection would inspire two months of arguments about abortion and Bush-era foreign policy), and you're left with the conventional wisdom, which has persuasively narrowed the field to four names: the former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty, Ohio Senator Rob Portman, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin.
Of these four, Pawlenty and Portman are the cautious-to-boring choices, Ryan and Jindal the younger, nerdier, riskier ones. But Ryan is probably a uniquely risky choice, because he embodies the Republican Party's commitment to entitlement reform, and that's a commitment that the Obama campaign will presumably be highlighting at every opportunity all fall.
There is a case to be made that this is a risk worth taking, since Romney is going to be attacked on Medicare no matter what, and Ryan is a uniquely fluent advocate for the conservative position. But everything we've seen from the Romney campaign suggests that they're very leery of saying or doing anything that might help make Obama's arguments for him or complicate their own near-obsessive focus on the economy. So it's reasonable to bet against Ryan on those grounds.
If Ryan is too closely associated with specific Obama-era arguments to be the favorite, Tim Pawlenty is probably too closely associated with his own once highly touted presidential campaign. The Minnesotan was supposed to give Romney his strongest challenge, but his bid looked stylistically lame and substantively lackluster even before Pawlenty famously backed down from a debate-stage confrontation with Romney himself.
The best case for Pawlenty is that he would bring a common touch and a populist style to a candidacy that currently lacks both. But that case was fatally undermined by the Minnesota governor's performance on the campaign trail last fall. A populist who inspires so little enthusiasm from actual voters that he drops out before the first ballot gets cast probably isn't the man to improve Mitt Romney's numbers with blue-collar voters in Ohio and Michigan - and absent that qualification, the argument for picking Pawlenty mostly evaporates.
This leaves Portman and Jindal. Like Ryan, both easily pass the "could he be president" test, with impressive resumes (absurdly impressive, in Jindal's case: He was running the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals at 24) and instant policy credibility. Like Pawlenty, both have experience running and winning statewide races in places that don't always elect Republicans.
But there's no question that an earnest white Midwestern Methodist like Portman would be the safer choice - so safe, in fact, that he would probably drop out of the headlines the day after he was picked. Jindal, on the other hand, would give the press all kinds of things to fixate on: His youth, his ethnicity, his Ichabod Crane physique, his religious background (he's a convert from Hinduism to Catholicism) and of course the endless interesting-and-then-some stories that you'll find percolating in Louisiana politics.
He's no Palin, in other words, but he is the kind of pick you make if you're willing to accept a little more risk for the chance of a little more reward. As someone who believes Romney is playing things too cautiously at present, I tend to think he should strongly consider the jolt that choosing Jindal might supply him. But as someone who's also convinced that the Romney camp is entirely content to just aim for a glide to 51 percent, I tend to think they'll just play it excruciatingly safe and go with Portman.
And as a journalist who's desperate for something unexpected to happen in this grim slog of a campaign, I'd be delighted if Romney made my analysis look foolish and showed that he has the capacity to genuinely surprise us.

HEADLINE: Boomers and Entitlements: The Backlash

BYLINE: BILL KELLER


HIGHLIGHT: Fielding reader comments on the Baby Boomers and Social Security. 

 BODY:
My column on the baby boomers and entitlements drew a fair amount of comment, some of it deep and thoughtful but much of it along the line of, to quote one kneejerk-left blog, "Elitist Hack Bill Keller Wants to Take Away Your Social Security." 
No, he doesn't want to do anything of the kind. But the tenor of some responses helps explain why groups like AARP, and most Democrats, flee from any serious discussion of entitlement reform. At a time when civil debate is in short supply, few subjects take the conversation more quickly down to invective than Social Security. 
That's all the more reason to keep talking. So 
The column proposed that baby boomers like me, who are flooding into the Social Security and Medicare rolls, should take the lead in fighting to reform those programs. Reform does not mean privatizing, a la the Paul Ryan/Mitt Romney approach, which I think is an underhanded way to cut benefits overall. And it does not mean whacking benefits for those who genuinely depend on these programs. (More on that in a minute.) It mostly means shifting more of the costs to those who can afford them, reconciling the programs to the changes in how we live, and using the government's power to help drive down the costs of medical care.
The purpose of taking on entitlements is twofold: to make the programs more sustainable (which in my view includes making them more progressive) and to free money for other things - most importantly, imho, investing in things only government can do, such as basic research and infrastructure.
As I said in the column, the Republicans at least have a plan. It amounts to dismantling Social Security and Medicare in favor of privatized savings accounts and private insurance vouchers. As I've said before, in defending Obamacare, I think it's too risky to expect ordinary consumers - busy, stressed, fearful, unschooled in the vagaries of markets - to be expert stewards of the investments on which their old-age security depends, or to be shrewd judges of competing health plans. They should have SOME skin in the game, but the Republican plans leave them bare naked. And the Republicans do not seem inclined to direct any of their anticipated savings into investment.
Except for a few centrist committees and think tanks - and being a centrist is more unpopular these days than being a boomer - Democrats have generally been AWOL on entitlements. What tax increases are for Republicans, entitlements are for Democrats: a third rail, a hot button, a sacred cow, pick your clich.
One reason I wish Democrats would take this on is that I believe they are more likely to come up with humane solutions that protect the poor and middle class.
In the column I listed a menu of things worth considering as part of a reform, but the two most important in my mind are:
a) Assuring that people who have ample resources of their own - people like me - either pay more or benefit less. One widely discussed way of doing that - endorsed not just by centrists but by more liberal Democrats like Robert Reich - is to raise the amount of income that is subjected to the Social Security payroll tax. The tax currently applies to the first $110,100 of income; raising it would go a long way toward fortifying Social Security and would shift more of the burden to those who are prospering.
b) Controlling our health care costs, which - as we are constantly reminded - are the highest on earth. This includes aggressive pilot programs that reward doctors who move away from fee-for-service into Accountable Care Organizations and bundled services; promoting living wills; reforming Medicare cost-sharing; and eliminating gimmicks states use to game the Medicaid program.
The menu includes some contentious moves that I think also deserve serious consideration. For example, raising the retirement age a bit, not for those who are on the verge of a long-planned retirement, but for those who are decades from retirement and have time to adjust. On the medical costs front, I think malpractice reform can reduce the proliferation of needless, defensive medical procedures, saving billions without putting patients at risk. There is no shortage of intelligent ideas for curbing entitlements without abandoning the vulnerable. But if politicians view this subject as too hot to touch, those ideas will go nowhere.
Now, to respond to some of the common themes in the digital mailbag:
Lay off the poor, long-suffering boomers.
There are baby boomers who have lost their jobs and baby boomers who have suffered foreclosures. There are baby boomers with underfunded pensions and no health insurance. There are baby boomers who have sacrificed so their kids can have a better life. I think I heard from all of them. "I've practiced a great deal of self-denial so that I wouldn't have to eat dog food in my 'golden' years," one boomer-reader wrote. And, by the way, the "greatest generation" wasn't so great. 
When I sketched the boomer caricature ("self-important, self-indulgent, etc.") I neglected to say "thin-skinned." I was trying to have some fun with the latest surge of boomer-bashing. Of course generalizations are facile. "Glib" was the word I used in the column. But I'm serious about the central proposition: our generation has a lot of clout, and we should use it to make sure that entitlements are part of any plan to restore some sense to federal spending. 
Why is this our problem? First, because we're the ones flooding into Social Security and Medicare. Second, because we - alongside members of the so-called "greatest generation" - have resisted fixing the system. Third, because we can. This generation (to generalize a little more) came of age with a restless activism directed at ending a war and expanding the rights of those kept down and kept out. We've lost some of that energy to exhaustion and arthritis, but we still have the numbers.
Social Security is special.
It's still a surprisingly common misconception that Social Security is like a bank account - you pay your money in, it gathers interest, and then you withdraw it when you hit retirement. Thus, some people conclude, a) the money is mine, I paid for it, no one has a right to touch it, and b) Social Security doesn't belong in any discussion of debt reduction or fiscal reform. 
Actually - as most of you know - the income of retirees is paid by younger Americans who are still in the work force. (Rick Perry was foolish to call it "a Ponzi scheme," but the pyramidal structure is similar.) You need several younger workers paying into the trust fund for every retiree who is getting a check. In 1950 there were 16 workers paying into the system for every beneficiary. Today there are three. 
While Social Security is "off-budget," a separate financial ecosystem, it does not operate on another planet. If the pool of retirees grows much faster than the active work force, you run out of money - and the government has to borrow to pay its obligations. Government debt is government debt, pretty much. The current estimate is that Social Security will hit a wall in 2036, when it will only be able to pay 75 percent of the benefits due to recipients. Then things get worse.
Take it from the rich. 
"To me," said one commenter, "the real villain in this story is the huge wealth gap that has grown in our country, not the gap in resources provided among different generations."
I'm all for fixing our tax system to close loopholes and restore some of the progressivity that has been lost. Any responsible bargain to revive the economy should include a substantial revenue component. And, as noted above, those (like me) who can afford it should pay more into or take less from Social Security and Medicare. But - quoting here from the Third Way report cited in my column - "Even if in 2014 we increased revenue to 21% of GDP - the highest it's been since the creation of the modern tax code - by 2040 we would still face an annual deficit of more than $4 trillion in 2012 dollars." Increasing tax revenues is necessary. It's just not sufficient.
Take it from the military.
"The problem is not 'entitlements,' but military spending. It is out of control, and has been at least since Eisenhower left office."
Military spending - and what becomes of it as we wind down two expensive wars - is a subject too important and complicated for a drive-by response in a blog post. More on that subject later. But the military share of the budget has been nearly flat for 20 years and, under the sequestration that kicks in if Congress fails to come up with a budget deal this year, defense will be cut quite dramatically. And the world has not become a noticeably safer place.
Disco is nothing for boomers to be ashamed of.
My favorite float in the comment parade: "As a more lighthearted aside: why pick on disco? Everything has a place. Recently, the world has lost Michael Jackson, one of the Gibb Brothers, and of course the queen of disco, Donna Summer. [#x2028]Disco celebrated love and joy, brought people of all colors, creeds, religions, ideologies and economic status together in dance under the big mirror ball and flashing lights. Careful frolicking fun and sometimes downright silliness and humor. [#x2028]In today's world of pessimism and darkness, perhaps spinning an old vinyl upbeat fun loving relic from that era and dressing in bright colored costumes is just what the "doctor" ordered."
This, I guess, is the place where I sheepishly confess to having BOTH Donna Summer and Gloria Gaynor in my workout mix.
