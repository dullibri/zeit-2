HEADLINE: Crackdown Announced on Groups Using Violence in Construction

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG

 BODY:
The Dinkins administration announced plans yesterday to crack down on the rising number of groups using violence and extortion to get jobs at construction sites for black and Hispanic workers.
The announcement came a day after two men who the police said belonged to the Queens Community Construction Coalition, a group that tries to get jobs for minorities, were fatally shot in a Queens park where they had gathered with about a dozen other men to discuss the day's job openings. The police said last night that they did not know whether the Queens coalition had ever resorted to violence. 
 The shooting occurred about 7 A.M. in Baisley Pond Park in South Jamaica, said a police spokesman, Sgt. Norris Hollomon. Officers have established no motive in the slayings.
Some law-enforcement officials have linked the shooting to the escalating violence among construction workers as some minority groups try to get a foothold in the largely white building trade. The proliferation of these groups has led some members to resort to gun battles in fierce fights over turf.
One of the victims in the slaying on Thursday, Raymond Atkinson, 25 years old, was the head of the Queens Coalition, Sergeant Hollomon said. The other man, Terry Lewis, 22, was a member of the group. No suspects have been arrested or identified in the killings, the sergeant said.
The director of the Mayor's Office of Construction, Rudolph J. Rinaldi, yesterday outlined countermeasures intended to squelch such violence. They include increasing police patrols at construction sites and tightening security to control access to those sites.
Mayor David N. Dinkins emphasized that he was not targeting "legitimate coalition groups," which, he said, do not resort to intimidation as a means to seek jobs for their members.
"Rogue groups, however, have stepped up their criminal activities, and we will take vigorous measures to prevent them from continuing down this road," the Mayor said. He added, "Although jobs may be scarce during the economic slump, workers at construction sites have the right to work without fearing for their lives."
The city has worked with the construction industry to develop new security procedures at the sites, like creating separate entrances for workers and visitors and designating liaisons between the sites and local police precincts, Mr. Rinaldi said.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Platinum Continues to Slide But Gold and Silver Are Up

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Platinum futures prices fell for the fifth straight day yesterday, as low inflation and relative calm in South Africa continued to erode gains posted during the last four months.
Gold and silver futures rose slightly, halting similar slides in those markets.
Platinum for October delivery fell $3.70 on the Mercantile Exchange in New York to $344.20 an ounce, the lowest settlement of a near-term contract since April 29. 
 On the Commodity Exchange in New York, August gold deliveries rose 70 cents, to $334.80 an ounce; September silver gained 2.2 cents to settle at $3.792 an ounce.
An ounce of platinum lost $34.40, or about 9 percent of its value, this week as speculative funds that had bet on rising prices bolted from the market. Gold fell more than 4 percent and silver more than 5 percent for the week.
 
Looking for Platinum's Low Point
 Platinum closed well above the day's low of $338.50, but analysts were reluctant to proclaim the slide in prices over.
"I would like to wish that it were," said Nina Lipton, research director of Platinum Guild International, an association of platinum producers and dealers.
"It's definitely an encouraging sign," she said. "But we have had a bounce off the lows each day this week so it doesn't necessarily mean the market has found a bottom."
Many analysts have linked this week's selling to a broad drop in commodity prices and other indicators of low inflation. Investors tend to buy precious metals as a hedge against inflation.
Platinum is also a barometer of the manufacturing economy because it is used in automobile pollution-control systems. When car sales rise, so does platinum demand.
 
Rally in Precious Metals
 The precious metals rallied strongly in the late spring and early summer as the economy appeared to be mending and political tensions in South Africa, a major producer of platinum and gold, increased.
But fears of a South African civil war proved unfounded, and this week's low inflation numbers indicated that the economic recovery has slowed -- a big disappointment to speculators who had put their money in metals.
Crude oil futures settled slightly lower amid profit taking in light trading on the Mercantile Exchange in New York.
Light crude for September delivery slipped 6 cents, to $21.28 a barrel; September heating oil rose 0.17 cent, to 58.90 cents a gallon; September unleaded gasoline fell 0.3 cent, to 60.80 cents a gallon, and September natural gas fell 2.1 cents, to $1.832 for 1,000 cubic feet.
Pork belly futures rose sharply on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, extending gains tied to expectations that Russia soon will bid for some of the 66 million pounds of American pork that the former Soviet republics have been authorized by the Bush Administration to buy at subsidized prices.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Republicans;
G.O.P.'s Platform Reveals Conservatives' Dominance

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Aug. 14

 BODY:
The platform the Republicans will adopt at their convention here next week and the drafting sessions this week illustrate the degree to which diehard conservatives are in control of party affairs.
In many respects this makes no practical difference. Unlike the situation in some parliamentary democracies, party platforms in the United States bind no one, least of all Presidential candidates. Once they are nominated, Republican and Democratic candidates alike tend to turn their backs on the parts of the ideological field near the goal lines and fight over the turf between the 30-yard lines. 
 From President Bush's perspective, what is most important about the platform is that it should generate enthusiasm among people who will raise money, knock on doors, run telephone banks and otherwise round up votes for him in November. In the Republican Party nowadays, such people tend to be much more conservative than a cross-section of Republican voters would be.
 
Some Stands Are Softened
 In a few instances, when the platform committee delegates reached the point of running out of control, Charles Black, one of Mr. Bush's senior political advisers, was able to pull the reins. That was the case when Mr. Black asked the delegates to reverse themselves and change a passage that termed the tax increases the President signed two years ago a "mistake." The delegates were also persuaded not to adopt a plank opposing favorable trade treatment for China.
But for the most part, the drafters were given a free hand. The President's camp did not seem worried about platform planks involving tax cuts far in excess of anything the Administration has even considered, a barrier along the entire Mexican border to keep out illegal immigrants, abortion restrictions more rigid than the President favors, or a strident attack on public broadcasting.
Nonetheless, it was striking how the conservative wing of the party dominated the platform-drafting proceedings and how the more moderate wing, which includes some of the most prominent Republican politicians, was almost completely excluded.
The dominant forces on the platform drafting committee were the chairman, Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma; the co-chairmen, Gov. John Ashcroft of Missouri and Representative Bill McCollum of Florida, and three outspoken Congressmen, Henry J. Hyde of Illinois, Vin Weber of Minnesota and Robert S. Walker of Pennsylvania. They are among the most conservative elected officials in America.
 
No Place for Moderates
 More moderate Republican officials like Senators John H. Chafee of Rhode Island, John C. Danforth of Missouri, William S. Cohen of Maine and Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico had no role in this process. Neither did such prominent Governors as Pete Wilson of California, William F. Weld of Massachusetts and John R. McKernan Jr. of Maine, or leading Representatives like Bill Gradison of Ohio, the top Republican on the House Budget Committee, and Jim Leach of Iowa, who is in line to be the ranking Republican on the House Banking Committee next year.
But if most of the delegates on the platform committee -- two from each state -- are not moderates, neither are they prominent. The two from Washington state are typical. Here are their biographies in full as provided by the Republican National Committee:
"Michael Undseth is the president of Micon Inc. He is also the founder of Family Action, a statewide grass-roots organization. In 1988, Mr. Undseth served as a delegate to the Republican National Convention. He has been married for 19 years and has three children.
"Cathy Mickels is the founder and president of the Washington Alliance of Families and has been involved in the pro-family movement in Washington state for the past six years. She is currently state committeewoman and a member of the Republican Party State Executive Board. In 1987, Mrs. Mickels was appointed to the Governor's Task Force on AIDS. She appears frequently on television and radio talk shows. Mrs. Mickels is married and has three children."
Perhaps as a consequence of the nature of the drafters, some passages in the Republican platform sound more like thoughts that might be expressed across a dinner than like statements of political goals.
 
'Blatant Political Bias'
 For example, the passage on public broadcasting states: "We deplore the blatant political bias of the Government-sponsored radio and television networks. It is especially outrageious that taxpayers are now forced to underwrite this biased broadcasting."
Mr. Bush has never proposed overhauling the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, as the platform recommends.
Past Republican platforms have emphasized the economy. Not this one. The economy section this year appears in the middle of the document, between the chapter on "Individual Rights, Good Homes and Safe Streets," where the abortion plank is included, and the chapter on "Reforming Government and the Legal System," which opposes statehood for the District of Columbia.
On that point, a preliminary draft stated, "The District of Columbia, with the most bloated bureaucracy anywhere, and its one-party rule, has brought massive dependency, hellish crime, illegal drugs and unrelenting scandal."
The drafters had second thoughts and dropped that sentence.
The document deplores the bureaucracy throughout, but one paragraph stands out. Here it is in its entirety, the punctuation and capitalization courtesy of the Republican Party:
"The Quality Revolution in the private sector, with its concepts of Continuous Improvement, Profound Knowledge, and 'Doing the Right Thing Right the First Time,' stands in stark contrast to the outmoded practices, insensitivity and outright waste, abuse, and corruption endemic in the bureaucratic welfare state. The Republican Party is firmly committed to bringing the Quality Revolution into government at every level by creating a 'Quality Workers for a Quality America' coalition whose aim will be to transform the bureaucratic welfare state into a government that is customer-friendly, cost-effective, and improving constantly."

HEADLINE: Bridgeport Has Rating on Bonds Upgraded by Standard & Poor's

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: BRIDGEPORT, Conn., Aug. 14

 BODY:
Standard & Poor's upgraded Bridgeport's credit rating today, citing the city's decision to abandon its bid for bankruptcy protection and its efforts to balance its budget.
Standard & Poor's, a New York bond-rating agency, said it was raising the rating on $68.5 million of outstanding general obligation debt to BB, from CCC. The bonds were given the CCC rating in June 1991 immediately after then-Mayor Mary Moran filed a Chapter 9 petition for bankruptcy protection. 
 A judge dismissed Mrs. Moran's petition in August 1991, saying the city was not technically insolvent, despite a $16 million budget deficit. Mrs. Moran filed an appeal.
 
Appeal Is Withdrawn
 But Mayor Joseph P. Ganim, who took office in November, withdrew the city's appeal this spring.
"This sends a very strong message that Bridgeport is rapidly on the road to fiscal recovery," Mr. Ganim said today.
The BB rating is still considered a noninvestment or speculative grade, but represents a significant improvement, said Peter D'Erchia, a director in Standard & Poor's municipal finance department.
Standard & Poor's also announced it was removing the city's rating from "Credit Watch," a status used when the agency expects a change in rating, and termed the current rating outlook as "positive."
Standard & Poor's said its decision to upgrade the rating was based on Mr. Ganim's move to drop the appeal of the bankruptcy dismissal and the administration's efforts to achieve a balanced budget.
 
11.6 Percent Unemployment
 The agency warned, however, that "there are many issues facing the city that will challenge long-term fiscal stability," including its high unemployment rate, which in June reached 11.6 percent. The agency said the city must attract and retain industry to maintain the tax base needed to achieve fiscal stability.
To achieve investment-grade rating, the city will have to show long-term stability, Mr. D'Erchia said.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: News Analysis;
Behind Bush's Mixed Abortion Signals

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 14

 BODY:
Richard M. Nixon's Attorney General, John N. Mitchell, had a pat answer for people bewildered by the Nixon Administration's policies: "Watch what we do, not what we say."
President Bush and his strategists seem to want it both ways: they want some people to watch what they say and others to watch what they do. Becalmed in the polls, under attack for having shifted ground on taxes, they have helped push through platform language that goes well beyond even the President's own strong anti-abortion position in an effort to insure the support of conservatives, while at the same time they have sent signals to abortion-rights supporters intended to make them feel comfortable voting for Mr. Bush. 
 Underlying all the maneuvering is a political reality deeply troubling for the Republicans. With the economy in low gear, the Reagan Democrats are moving back toward their ancestral party; the Republicans' only chance of holding them may lie in reviving the social issues that attracted them in the first place.
 
Coalition's Fracturing Issue
 But whereas racial questions and the cold war tended to solidify the new Republican coalition assembled in the 1970's and 1980's, with the Reagan Democrats at its center, abortion tends to fracture it. This time the wedge issue points the wrong way.
So first Vice President Dan Quayle, then Mr. Bush himself, have said in recent days that they would support a daughter or a granddaughter who elected to have an abortion after they had urged her not to.
On Thursday, most striking of all, Barbara Bush, who will move into a more overtly partisan role next week when she makes a featured speech at the Republican convention in Houston, described abortion as "a personal decision" that should be omitted altogether from party platforms. Mr. Bush's handlers regard the First Lady as one of their main campaign assets, and using her to deliver a message on abortion underlined the seriousness of the problem it presents for the Republicans.
 
Bush Backs Platform Stand
 To complicate matters still further, the President's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said today that Mr. Bush was thoroughly pleased with the work of the platform committee.
"He supports their position," the spokesman said. "Mrs. Bush has her own attitudes about this."
No one can prove it, but almost all practicing politicians here see the contradictions as a matter of carefully calibrated electoral strategy.
"If just Quayle had said something, you could look at it as an accident," said David Keene of the American Conservative Union. "But with three comments like that in succession, you know it's a deliberate plan."
In Los Angeles today, Gov. Bill Clinton said, "It appears that everyone on the Republican ticket is moving to the Democratic position on that issue," adding, "They're trying to have it both ways."
For weeks White House strategists have worried that the platform Mr. Bush thought he had to grant abortion opponents, both as the price of their support and to avoid charges that he was as wishy-washy on abortion as the conservatives say he is on taxes, was too inflexible for most of the country. Many of the President's closest advisers are haunted by the warning of the late Lee Atwater, Mr. Bush's 1988 campaign manager, that there would be trouble unless the Republicans erected a tent big enough to accommodate all views on abortion. But they have found no effective way to heed his advice.
As approved by the drafting committee in Houston this week, the platform, essentially identical to 1988's abortion provision, declares that "the unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed," even in the circumstances in which the President favors allowing exceptions: pregnancies resulting from rape or incest.
The platform calls for a constitutional amendment banning abortion, and there is no doubt that the delegates, following the instructions issued by Mr. Bush through his convention managers, will ratify it. But a Washington Post-ABC News survey found that 55 percent of the 2,210 delegates opposed such a constitutional ban while only 28 percent of them supported the idea.
Among Republican voters nationwide, New York Times/CBS News polls in June and July found that only 19 percent of Republican voters favor outlawing abortion, with 39 percent arguing that it should be generally available as it is now and 40 percent saying it should continue to be available but under stricter limits.
Democrats and independents, numerous polls have shown, are even less favorable to an absolute ban than Republicans.
 
Goldwater Is Critical
 Extreme platform positions, like the ones adopted by the Democrats at Miami Beach in 1972 and the Republicans at San Francisco in 1964, have often led to landslide defeats. Not so for Ronald Reagan, a master at running on right-wing platforms that appealed to the ideologues in the party and winning the backing of others by his personal charm and broad goals for the nation.
Whether Mr. Bush can do something similar remains to be seen; he has less pure political appeal than Mr. Reagan, and many voters already see him as a hypocrite because he went back on his "read my lips" tax pledge.
Barry Goldwater, who suffered the consequences of the 1964 Republican platform, said the other day that Mr. Bush was "wrong as wrong can be" to back a rigid platform plank on abortion. It would sink the President and other Republican candidates, he predicted, and leave the party in "a shambles."
So far at least, Mr. Bush has not succeeded in having it both ways. He seems to have convinced the hard-liners that he is still with them, but he has failed to paper over the deep split within the party.
Ralph Reed, the executive director of the Christian Coalition, the political arm of the Rev. Pat Robertson's broadcasting interests, said in Houston that Mr. Bush, not Mrs. Bush, made policy and that policy, not words, is what matters. He added: "The President wants this plank, he got this plank, and he's going to keep this plank. The other side was defeated, vanquished. It's over."
Mrs. Bush's statement, said Nancy Sternoff, the executive director of the National Republican Coalition for Choice, means party leaders "have already read the signals that Republican women will not pull the lever for George Bush in November."
She and other abortion-rights leaders have vowed to take the fight to the floor of the convention next week. But the White House is putting the pressure on elected leaders, including Gov. Pete Wilson of California, and it may be able to block a nationally televised debate -- a debate that would dramatize Republican disunity a month after the Democratic unity-fest in New York.

HEADLINE: Prices of U.S. Bonds Rebound From Selloff

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices rebounded yesterday after a big selloff in the previous session.
The price of the Treasury's main 30-year bond gained23/32 point, or $7.19 per $1,000 in face amount, regaining some of Thursday's drop, which exceeded $12. The bond's yield fell to 7.31 percent from 7.41 percent late Thursday. 
 The rebound occurred in moderate trading.
Economists said bonds appeared to gain strength from the latest consumer confidence survey by the University of Michigan, which showed confidence in the economy remaining at low levels.
A weak economy benefits bonds because it improves the chances for lower interest rates, which increase the prices of Treasury securities.
On Thursday, the bond market was jolted, apparently by comments by former Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d renewing President Bush's call for lower capital gains tax rates and more tax exemptions for individuals. That could improve the economy, hurting bonds.
Kevin Flanagan, a money market economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., had a different theory yesterday. He said Thursday's drop may have actually been induced by selling pressure after the market aborbed $36 billion this week in new securities from the Government's quarterly refunding auctions.
Other economic news yesterday did not appear to have much impact on the market. The Federal Reserve reported industrial production rose four-tenths of 1 percent in July. The Commerce Department said inventories rose by six-tenths of 1 percent in June, including a rise in retailers' stocks.
The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, which measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or longer, rose 3.55, to 1,273.36.
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, short-term maturities posted rises between 5/32 to11/32 points, intermediate maturities rose 7/16 point and long-term issues rose as much as15/32 point, the Telerate Inc. financial information service reported.
The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 3.12 percent as the discount fell 1 basis point, to 3.06 percent. Yields on six-month bills fell to 3.24 percent as the discount fell 2 basis points, to 3.15 percent. Yields on one-year bills fell to 3.67 percent as the discount fell 4 basis points to 3.25 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The yield is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at maturity.

HEADLINE: New Jersey Still Beckons To Exchange In New York

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
Despite an agreement by three of the city's five commodities exchanges to remain in New York, the city could still lose thousands of jobs and tens of millions of dollars in tax revenue if the New York Mercantile Exchange, the largest of the five, makes good on its threat to leave.
Officials of the Mercantile Exchange said yesterday that they have not yet decided whether to stay or to move to Jersey City, where office space is less expensive. The officials said they would make a decision by fall. 
 On Thursday, the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, the New York Cotton Exchange and the Commodity Exchange said they had agreed to stay in New York and to build a new $150 million trading center in lower Manhattan, with half the financing to be provided by the city and state. The agreement is expected to save 9,000 jobs and $50 million in tax revenue.
 
Unhappy With Quarters
 The Mercantile Exchange pulled out of a similar plan to build a joint trading headquarters with the other four exchanges in January because they felt the project would not meet their needs. The five exchanges are looking to relocate because they say they are unhappy with their cramped quarters in the World Trade Center.
Officials of the smallest exchange, the New York Futures Exchange, said yesterday that it too would remain in New York and would probably rent space in the new trading center being built by the three commodities exchanges. The Futures Exchange employs about 50 people. However, no formal deal has been reached yet, the officials said.
Robert Bennis, a relocation consultant for the Mercantile Exchange, said yesterday that the exchange is looking at several locations in New York City and New Jersey, but he declined to be more specific, saying that the negotiations are confidential until a formal agreement has been reached.
In determining where it will relocate, the Mercantile Exchange is considering economics, time and space, Mr. Bennis said. The exchange wants to move into new quarters by the end of 1994 and it believes that it will be cheaper to renovate an existing building rather than build a new center.
 
Looking at Offers
 The Mercantile Exchange, which employs 3,500 people and generates $50 million in annual tax revenue for the city, is also looking closely at the development grants and tax incentives that New York City and Jersey City have to offer. "Both jurisdictions of New York and New Jersey have been extremely cooperative in exploring various options," Mr. Bennis said. "I hope we can be as successful as the other exchanges were in reaching a deal."
Carl Weisbrod, president of the City Economic Development Corporation, said yesterday that talks with the Mercantile Exchange have been constructive and declined further comment. Officials of New Jersey's Commerce Department, which oversees economic development, were unavailable for comment.
Meanwhile, the TriBeCa Task Force, a group of residents who live near the proposed site of the new commodities trading center, vowed yesterday to press ahead with a lawsuit it has filed to block the project.
John T. Van Der Tuin, a lawyer for group, said that residents oppose the project because they believe it will increase noise, traffic congestion and safety hazards near the site, a city-owned lot bounded by Greenwich, West, Warren and Murray streets in TriBeCa.
Mr. Van Der Tuin said that while the task force wants to keep jobs and tax revenues in the city, it believes that the commodities exchanges do not have to build a new center and instead should relocate to some of the abundant existing office space in the city.

HEADLINE: Dow Up 15.67, but Off 3.24 for Week

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Wall Street stocks closed higher yesterday as an upturn in the bond market helped shares snap a three-day losing streak.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 15.67 points to end at 3,328.94. For the week, the index lost 3.24 points. 
 On the New York Stock Exchange, advancing issues led declines 1,103 to 591 on moderate volume of 166.8 million shares, compared with 185.8 million Thursday.
The market's gains, which come just before the Republican Party's national convention next week, could be setting the foundation for a recovery, analysts said.
Investors will be watching for President Bush's economic plans following reports on Thursday about possible changes in tax policy.
"I think the stock market is finally starting either the Republican convention rally or an extension of the summer rally, which could carry through into September," said David Bostian, chief strategist at Herzog Heine Geduld.
"To the extent the Republicans make a unified presentation, the market will accept it favorably," he said. "In addition, I think the Fed may decide to give us one final cut in the discount rate or the Federal funds rate."
Investors also moved back into stocks after the bond market recovered from Thursday's steep drop. The 30-year bond closed up 23/32 of a point, which lowered its yield to 7.31 percent from 7.41 percent Thursday.
The White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said yesterday that the bond market had probably overreacted on Thursday to comments made by the new White House chief of staff, James A. Baker 3d, who said the Government should emphasize lower tax rates and government spending limits. Mr. Fitzwater said Mr. Baker's remarks were not hinting at specific new programs.
Bill Raftery, a technical analyst at Smith Barney, said the market has been anticipating the convention next week. "Economic figures have not been that convincing one way or the other."
 
'The Market Will Tread Water'
The batch of economic reports released yesterday -- July industrial production, capacity use and early-August consumer confidence -- had little impact on the market. "Unless something weird happens, I think the market will tread water between 3,300 and 3,400," Mr. Raftery said.
In trading, Lowe's Companies tumbled $4.375, to $18.675. Prudential lowered its earnings estimate, and Dean Witter cut its rating after the company issued its second-quarter earnings results.
Medco Containment rose $1.675, to $30.50, after the prescription drug company posted fourth-quarter results. Alex. Brown repeated a buy rating on the company.
United States Surgical jumped $6, to $77.75, continuing to recover from losses earlier this week. Kidder Peabody repeated a buy rating.
The stock of the Symantec Corporation slipped $1.25, to $16.75. Soundview lowered its earnings estimates on the software company.
Reynolds Metals added $2.125, to $56.125. Paine Webber upgraded its rating to neutral from sell.
Traders said Goldman, Sachs removed Owens-Corning Fiberglas and Black & Decker from its recommended list. Owens-Corning lost $1.375, to $33, and Black & Decker fell $1.125, to $19.125.
JWP Inc., the computer systems company, lost 12.5 cents, to $6.25. It revised its second-quarter earnings and restated its first-quarter results to reflect a charge.

Dollar Is Mixed as Traders Await Signs of Rate Moves

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar was mixed yesterday as traders waited to see if interest rates would fall in the United States and rise in Germany. Lower American rates and higher foreign yields would make the dollar less attractive for investors.
The dollar closed at 126.00 Japanese yen in New York, down from 126.50 yen late Thursday. In Tokyo, the dollar fell to 126.03 yen, from 127.37. In London, it rose to 126.25 yen. 
 In New York, the British pound fell to $1.9210, from $1.9340 on Thursday. In trading in London, the pound fell to $1.9165, from $1.9315 late Thursday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with those of late Thursday, included: 1.4650 German marks, up from 1.4555; 1.3205 Swiss francs, up from 1.3075; 4.9675 French francs, up from 4.9375; 1,113.50 Italian lire, up from 1,106.00, and 1.19175 Canadian dollars, down from 1.19375.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday's, included: 1.4683 German marks, up from 1.4585; 1.3240 Swiss francs, up from 1.3155; 4.9766 French francs, up from 4.9470; 1.6554 Dutch guilders, up from 1.6440; 1,116.21 Italian lire, up from 1,107.25, and 1.1933 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1921.
Silver rose in London to a late bid of $3.82 an ounce, up from $3.81 late Thursday. On the Commodity Exchange, silver was quoted at $3.784 an ounce, up 2.2 cents.

HEADLINE: Critic's Notebook;
Should TV Be Carrying Reports of Carryings-On?

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
When President Bush appears with David Brinkley on ABC tomorrow morning, will he be further provoked by questions about a reported extramarital affair while he was Vice President? Since a network spokesman offers assurances that no deal has been struck, will Mr. Brinkley voluntarily lay off? And if a rude word is uttered, will Mr. Bush douse this pooh-bah of ABC in the sort of indignation that he has already squirted on mere reporters like Mary Tillotson of CNN and Stone Phillips of NBC?
Mr. Bush's angry rebuffs, echoed by Vice President Dan Quayle and Barbara Bush, should bring a hearty amen from all the commentators who have been predicting that the 1992 campaign would come to this, and worse, even though no member of the President's official or personal family took umbrage when Bill Clinton was subjected to a more strenuous going-over during the primaries. 
 Who, if anyone, is to blame here? And for what?
Does some blame attach to the network reporters who dared speak the words that were already on the front page of The New York Post? I don't think so. Reporters respond to news; that's the job. If a book is published that says the President of the United States had an affair, it is only natural for them to follow up on it. The network coverage, brief and matter of fact, was by every measure more on the safe side of sensationalism than the coverage of the Clinton-Gennifer Flowers episode.
The well-known self-censorship of journalists regarding the carryings-on of Presidents John F. Kennedy and Dwight D. Eisenhower are not reassuring precedents. Such solicitude to a powerful figure makes one wonder what other facts known within the Beltway are not being passed along to those on the outside whom the reporters are supposed to serve.
If maturity prevailed, the lightly supported account of foolings-around by Mr. Bush, like reports of Mr. Clinton's relations with another woman or other women, or Gary Hart's much advertised liaison might be passed over with a smile or a sigh or a shrug as the nation concentrates on serious matters. No such luck. Mr. Bush must have known that whatever his answer, the tabloids of press and television would play it up for all it was worth, and a lot more. If he needs a target for his outrage, there it is.
But this is old stuff. The new factor in 1992 is the attention being given -- emphatically but by no means exclusively by the Republicans -- to family values. The candidates are asking for it. When Mr. Bush and Mr. Quayle and their hirelings put on their holier-than-thou show for the cameras, it may play to the big audience for religious broadcasting. But there is another, much bigger television audience that gobbles up the dirt on the high and mighty. And they are served night after night by programs whose stock in trade is the inside story or the hard copy glorifying, sentimentalizing, exposing celebrities.
The candidates or their speech writers seem to have learned a thing or two from the success of these shows. Hardly had the Democratic team been nominated than Mr. Clinton was letting the nation in on details of his father's death before little Bill was born and the alcoholic tendencies of his brother, and Al Gore was treating viewers to an account of the near-death of his son and his sister's death from cancer. After those made-for-television confessionals, who will be able to take seriously any future complaints about intrusions on the Democrats' privacy?
One can imagine Republican operatives dredging around for similar hankie-soakers to reward anyone who actually tunes in their convention; the Quayle children and the Bush grandchildren may be at risk. If the latest reports of adultery have any redeeming value, it is that they may inhibit the Republicans from smogging up the screen with familial rectitude this week. They may simply content themselves with putting Mrs. Bush on show. Let the Democrats take a whack at her, in the manner that Republicans are giving it to Hillary Clinton, if they dare.
Pundits on all channels agree that the election is likely to be decided on issues like unemployment and other pains of the recession. These are not without human-interest possibilities for television, but the medium is famously fickle, and the lines at welfare offices and the tales of woe may be losing their appeal.
The absence of a parent, the afflictions of a child, marital strains and a touch of adultery may be required to stir the juices of a television audience turned on by the doings and undoings of Prince Charles and the Princess of Wales. How much more stimulating to hear America's royals anguish over what they would do if a granddaughter or a daughter wanted to have an abortion than to hear them talk about health care.
Quite possibly most people will take entertainment where they can get it and still vote their pocketbooks. But you never know. As voters find relief from wearying and sometimes unfathomable problems in the politics of the soap opera, the democracy of the ballot is in danger of infection by the democracy of the tube.

HEADLINE: Haitians, Delivered to Danger

 BODY:
Yesterday the U.S. Government literally delivered 154 would-be refugees into the hands of the Haitian dictatorship's police. That seems a stark violation of the prohibitions in international and U.S. law against returning refugees to the face of danger, a practice known by the French legal term refoulement.
Whatever the Supreme Court finally decides about the legality of President Bush's Executive Order on Haitian refugees, it shames American values and traditions to push people into the hands of thugs like those now running Haiti. 
 Economics drives some who flee; Haiti has long been desperately poor. But since a bloody coup last September deposed the country's first freely elected President, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, millions of Aristide supporters have had good reason to fear violent political persecution.
Washington acknowledges the new regime's brutality and is seeking to pressure it out of office with economic sanctions and diplomacy. But it has also declared war on Haitian refugees, trying to prevent them not only from reaching the U.S. but from fleeing Haiti at all.
Under the terms of an Executive Order Mr. Bush issued in May, the Coast Guard now intercepts refugee vessels off the Haitian coast. It automatically returns the passengers to Haiti without determining if they have legitimate claims to refugee status. The Administration says it is not obliged to make such determinations as long as the Haitians have not reached U.S. territory. The Supreme Court is due to rule soon on that claim.
Washington also contends that its new policy saves lives by deterring Haitians from setting sail in flimsy boats. Yet still they sail, like the 158 picked up by the cutter Confidence Wednesday night. By the Administration's own reasoning they must be desperate indeed, since they must have been aware they had little chance of ever reaching the U.S. or any other port of asylum.
Their fears proved well founded. Minutes after the Confidence deposited its passengers on the pier in Port-au-Prince, Haitian police forced all but four onto buses and took them to police headquarters to be questioned about their departure.
If the Haitian Government is smart, it will defer further retaliation against these refugees so as not to increase pressure on the White House to adopt more humane policies. If the Bush Administration is smart, it will suspend enforcement of the Executive Order.

HEADLINE: Pollution's Chief Victims: The Poor

BYLINE: By Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Dennis Rivera; Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is a lawyer for the Hudson Riverkeeper and the Natural Resources Defense Council. Dennis Rivera is president of Local 1199 of the Drug, Hospital and Health Care Employees Union.

 BODY:
It is a popular perception that environmental protection is the exclusive concern of the privileged. In fact, it is the poor and disfranchised who are at greatest risk from environmental abuse.
Inexorably, society's wastes flow toward communities debilitated by social unrest, high illiteracy and unemployment, and low voter registration. They have become toxic dumping grounds while receiving few of the safeguards that prudence and decency demand but only political power can obtain. Examples abound across the nation. 
 * When well-connected Manhattan residents objected to proposals to put the North River sewage treatment plant at West 72d Street, obliging city officials moved the facility to west Harlem. The chronic stench of the poorly designed plant is one more demoralizing obstacle to revitalization of the neighborhood.
* New York State's largest medical-waste incinerator, originally proposed for suburban Rockland County, towers over a densely populated South Bronx neighborhood. Its emissions may include lead, cadmium, mercury, dibenzofurans and dioxin. New York City plans to construct seven additional incinerators in low- income neighborhoods that will produce 7,000 tons of poisonous gas a year.
* The Environmental Protection Agency said in a report this spring that three of every four toxic-waste dumps that fail to comply with the agency's regulations are in black or Hispanic neighborhoods.
The nation's largest toxic-waste dump is in Emelle, Ala., an utterly impoverished city that is 80 percent black. The highest concentration of such dumps is on Chicago's South Side. Half of the country's blacks and Hispanics live in neighborhoods with hazardous waste dumps.
* Two million tons of radioactive uranium has been dumped on Native American lands. Navajo teen-agers have sexual-organ cancer at 17 times the national average.
* Some 300,000 Hispanic farm laborers suffer each year from illnesses related to pesticides.
* Inner-city children in Los Angeles have 10 to 15 percent less lung efficiency than those in less smoggy cities. Pollution-related asthma is killing African-Americans at five times the rate it kills whites.
* Eight million children, principally poor and minority, have lead poisoning. They live in substandard housing that has peeling paint and lead pipes. Often they live near highways, incinerators or toxic waste sites. Forty-four percent of urban black children are at risk from lead poisoning.
What can the labor and environmental movements do about all this? Environmentalists must diversify their staffs and directors racially and culturally and support the growing environmental justice movement by sharing with it technical, legal, lobbying and financing resources.
Unions must continue to alert their members to environmental threats on the job and in their neighborhoods. Workers should help organize and lobby against dangerous facilities in poor communities and in favor of alternatives like recycling.
Together, we should work for laws that force the government and developers to provide communities with complete information about the dangers of new facilities. We can pressure Congress to reauthorize the Resource Conservation Recovery Act that will ban the production of toxic materials that cannot be reused or recycled.
We must fight to restore Federal programs, cut during the Reagan-Bush era, to rebuild sewage plants and water delivery systems, increase recycling, revitalize city parks and expand public transportation.
Society must recognize that economic and social injustice are a virulent form of pollution. As we endeavor to heal the wounds that afflict our planet, we must also heal the inequities that divide our nation.

HEADLINE: Guess Who's Not Coming to Houston

BYLINE: By Ken Ruberg; Ken Ruberg is national director of the Republican Mainstream Committee in Washington.

DATELINE: HOUSTON

 BODY:
Deafening calls for the election of a Republican Congress are certain to be a rhetorical favorite at the G.O.P. convention. Stressing the intransigence of Democratic lawmakers, speaker after speaker will urge voters to end government deadlock, free George Bush and save the nation by electing like-minded Republicans to the House and Senate.
As a progressive Republican firmly committed to my party's traditional ideals, the need to end the Democrats' 40-year domination of Congress seems compelling. Too many Democratic legislators, beholden to special-interest groups and political-action committee money, are incapable of setting budget priorities, restraining Federal spending or placing reasonable limits on taxation. 
 Paradoxically, many Republican officeholders will not attend the convention, trying instead to distance themselves by campaigning at home or enjoying vacation far away from Houston's heat. Why?
It seems obvious that Congressional conservatives, expert like most incumbents in the art of self-preservation, are abandoning the President at a time of need. First having tied his hands with rigid economic orthodoxy and a narrow social agenda, the conservatives are now fleeing at the sight of a restive electorate demanding something far different.
The party's conservative wing, it should be remembered, fought consistently throughout the 1980's for fiscal policies that insured staggering deficits, guaranteed inertia in domestic policy and jeopardized our economic future. Many of these same legislators have been unyielding in their insistence that George Bush adhere religiously to a divisive social agenda: opposition to civil and women's rights; support of Government-written school prayer and the undermining of public schools.
But times change and what was viewed in the Reagan era as a winning agenda now places this Republican President and many party candidates in harm's way. The issues Americans care about in this election are mostly economic -- jobs, growth, education and health care. Voters want bold domestic initiatives and social progress, not the economic status quo and state-managed morality.
Even as re-election-minded Congressional conservatives avoid the G.O.P. convention, grass-roots allies on the secular and religious right have tightened their python-like grip on the party's agenda. During the Republican platform deliberations last week, activists loyal to Pat Robertson and Phyllis Shlafly exerted the kind of influence available only to those more interested in purging critics than in building coalitions, in achieving ideological purity than in winning elections.
The platform -- once viewed as a statement of principle and philosophy intended to appeal to the broadest possible number of voters -- now stands out as a document written to exclude intentionally many of those who might otherwise support Republican candidates.
The conservatives' defeat of proposals that sought merely to recognize respectfully a view on abortion held by more than two-thirds of all Republicans and independents has been well reported. Not well publicized, but certain to be exploited by the Democrats, is the platform's indifference and hostility toward public education. Perhaps expecting divine intervention, platform writers failed to mention the need to finance improvements in public education but took great care to promote religious and private schools and home schooling.
Knowing that the Republican right was likely to dominate this convention, it is not surprising that many prominent Congressional moderates have also chosen to avoid Houston. The further G.O.P. doctrine moves from the mainstream of the American body politic, the further the party's centrists will separate themselves from party dogmatists. Like Barry Goldwater, who warned last week of the political threat posed by social conservatives, they abhor the litmus-test politics of today's Republicanism.
Thus, we have a great political paradox. The Republican Party has fallen prey to the same mistakes and pitfalls that have led Democrats to defeat in five of the past six Presidential contests. While the other party appears unified and Bill Clinton projects a centrist image, conservative interest groups are dragging George Bush to the right, alienating the center and threatening to walk away from the mess they've created. The President, non-ideological and conciliatory by nature, will bear the consequences.

HEADLINE: Culture Is Destiny

BYLINE: By Jason DeParle; Jason DeParle covers social policy in the Washington bureau of The New York Times.

 BODY:

WHO PROSPERS?
How Cultural Values Shape
Economic and Political Success.
By Lawrence E. Harrison.
280 pp. New York:
Basic Books. $22. 
 IT is hard to argue with the premise of "Who Prospers?": cultural values do shape economic and political success. The tricky part is that the opposite is also true: success helps shape culture.
Consider the devastated ghettos of American cities. It is true that a subculture of violent crime helps chase away jobs. It is also true that the lack of jobs fuels the violence. The complicated ways in which culture interacts with politics and economics is the subject of a huge which-comes-first debate.
Lawrence E. Harrison states emphatically -- and a bit extremely -- that culture comes first. Sure, he says, other forces shape the success of nations and of subgroups within them -- natural resources, military conquests, public policy, race relations. "But," he maintains, "it is values and attitudes -- culture -- that differentiate ethnic groups and are mainly responsible" when nations or communities prosper.
The first part of "Who Prospers?" consists of four international case studies, which argue that culture accounts for the recent economic progress of Brazil, Spain, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. Mr. Harrison concedes that culture is a "fuzzy" concept, but says he is thinking of traits like a sense of community, a strong ethical code and a desire to work and study.
The second part of the book argues that values also explain the prosperity of Asian immigrants to the United States and the harder times experienced by Hispanic and black people. Mr. Harrison writes that an erosion of values is undermining the country's vitality.
If that seems like a lot to bite off in a 280-page book, it is, and not all of it seems well digested. Now expanding his scope, Mr. Harrison is given to overly broad generalizations. Seven years ago, he published "Underdevelopment Is a State of Mind," a well-regarded book on development in Latin America, where he worked for many years directing programs for the United States Agency for International Development.
His basic instincts are welcome ones. He accurately notes that left-liberal opinion once regarded discussion of values suspiciously, viewing it as an attempt to blame the victims for their poverty. The easing of these intellectual taboos has been an important development, resulting in a richer discussion of poverty both overseas and at home.
But "Who Prospers?" seems so obsessed with cultural forces that it cannot see the other actors on the stage. Certainly Mr. Harrison is right that East Asian development has been aided by "Confucian values," such as the emphasis on education and family. But South Korea was no less Confucian in the 1960's than it was in the booming 1980's, just poorer.
As Mr. Harrison understands, the story of South Korea's subsequent success is a complex one that involved interventionist government policies intended to promote exports, the health of international markets and consequences of Korean politics. But he is so eager to accommodate his thesis that he relegates these competing explanations to the margin. The reader is left to conclude that culture drives development except when it doesn't.
Mr. Harrison is particularly reductive when writing about black poverty in the United States, which he attributes primarily to "a set of values and attitudes, strongly influenced by the slavery experience" and reinforced by Jim Crow. Mr. Harrison says that these values include a lack of initiative, the evasion of labor and the idealization of leisure, once the province only of the master.
The terrible misery of black inner cities has multiple and complicated causes. The story undoubtedly does include cultural factors, particularly the demise of the black family, a trend on which this book is curiously silent. Perhaps that is because family breakdown accelerated long after slavery, timing that does not fit with Mr. Harrison's thesis.
Many other forces are also involved in the ghettos' collapse: the loss of good jobs, racial hostility, flawed social welfare policies, bad schools and the influx of crack, which is both a cause and an effect of the suffering. The book ignores many of these factors and gives short shrift to others. The loss of jobs for low-skilled workers gets, by my count, a total of 11 words.
Values like hard work, thrift and concern for community do promote success, but I found myself thinking of Appalachia, perhaps the country's most persistently poor region. A disdain for community does seem part of the explanation for its poverty. But that cultural trait belonged to the conquering coal industry, not the laboring miners trapped in company towns.
Mr. Harrison provides a useful service in bringing culture back into the discussion of poverty. He offers one important answer to the question "Who Prospers?" but there are many others.

BYLINE: By LAUREL GRAEBER

 BODY:
SAVAGE INEQUALITIES: Children in America's Schools, by Jonathan Kozol. (Harper Perennial, $10.) Public schools are supposed to provide poor children with an educational opportunity equal to that of their more affluent peers; instead, Jonathan Kozol demonstrates, they perpetuate the inequities inherent in the rest of their pupils' lives. "The ultimate issue is whether Americans can be induced to care about children other than their own," Andrew Hacker said here last year, calling this a "depressing -- and essential -- book."
TWO LIVES: "Reading Turgenev" and "My House in Umbria," by William Trevor. (Penguin, $10.) Each of these novellas explores the life of a woman who uses the power of her imagination -- and ultimately of fiction -- to transform a bleak reality. In "Reading Turgenev," Mary Louise Quarry, unhappily married, retreats into the comfort of her cousin's love even after his death. Emily Delahunty, the narrator of "My House in Umbria," is a romance writer who attempts to reshape the fates of the people staying at her villa, all victims of a terrorist bombing. Last year our reviewer, Alida Becker, commended Mr. Trevor, an Irish writer living in England, for the "shifting magic of his storytelling." "Two Lives," she said, is "one of the most absorbing books in a body of work that has, at least in America, been more widely praised than read." 
 AFRICAN SILENCES, by Peter Matthiessen. (Vintage, $10.) These three essays describing trips to Africa poignantly attest to the disappearance of wildlife and the need to match conservation efforts to the needs of the local population. Mr. Matthiessen "is our greatest modern nature writer in the lyrical tradition that I have called Franciscan," Stephen Jay Gould said here last year. There are ominous silences in our country as well. Marc Reisner, the author of GAME WARS: The Undercover Pursuit of Wildlife Poachers (Penguin, $11), saw their danger in the years he traveled with Dave Hall, a Louisiana-based undercover agent for the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. Last year our reviewer, Roger B. Swain, found in his writing "all the loving attention and skill of the best Southern novelists."
ALL-BRIGHT COURT, by Connie Porter. (Harper Perennial, $10.) Connie Porter's first novel focuses on the 1960's and 70's and the inhabitants of a Buffalo tenement that is home to the community's black steelworkers. "Ms. Porter conveys the truth of her characters' lives," Anne Whitehouse said here last year. "The effect is heart-rending and exhilarating."
ISRAEL'S SECRET WARS: A History of Israel's Intelligence Services, by Ian Black and Benny Morris. (Evergreen/Grove Weidenfeld, $16.95.) The authors examine the evolving role of Israel's three intelligence services -- Mossad, Shin Bet and Aman -- showing that their relative freedom from government authority has predisposed them to engage in rogue operations as well as far-flung heroics. Last year our reviewer, Amos Perlmutter, found the book objective, filled with "fascinating information and entertaining anecdote."
DEAD CERTAINTIES: (Unwarranted Speculations), by Simon Schama. (Vintage, $12.) Is this a novel or a history book? It's a bit of both, as Simon Schama looks at two events -- a general's battlefield death in 1759 and a doctor's murder in 1849 -- from the standpoint of different narrators, some real, some imagined. "The result is a mind-teasing delight," R. .W. B. Lewis said in The Book Review last year.
RIVETHEAD: Tales From the Assembly Line, by Ben Hamper. (Warner, $9.99.) A writer and former riveter in a General Motors plant recounts his days on a job that he compares to "being paid to flunk high school for the rest of your life." Our reviewer, Verlyn Klinkenborg, saw Mr. Hamper as a Dante of blue-collar hell. "Both hatred and humor -- an ulcerating mix -- boil over in 'Rivethead,' " he said last year.
THE CAVALIER CASE, by Antonia Fraser. (Bantam, $4.99.) Lady Antonia Fraser's prolific writing career includes mystery novels whose heroine is Jemima Shore, a British television reporter. In this, the seventh, Jemima investigates supernatural phenomena at an old English estate. Last year our reviewer, Anne Tolstoi Wallach, said that the author writes "both history and mystery with zest and verve."
HARD COURTS, by John Feinstein. (Villard, $12.) And you thought rock stars were bad. This book chronicles a professional tennis season (January to August 1990), revealing unscrupulous wheeling and dealing and outrageous behavior both on and off the court. Mr. Feinstein's "extraordinary access has given him rare insight," Julie Cart said here last year.
ISAAC AND HIS DEVILS, by Fernanda Eberstadt. (Warner, $9.99.) As a fictional hero, Isaac Hooker has plenty to torment him: nearsightedness, childhood deafness, social ineptitude, a genius I.Q. and his parents' unhappy marriage. Last year our reviewer, Barbara Quick, said, "Ms. Eberstadt seems to understand perfectly the pain and passion of the gifted child."
THE MOMMY CLUB, by Sarah Bird. (Laurel/Dell, $10.) This book's premise inevitably recalls the infamous "Baby M." case: the narrator, an unemployed artist and free spirit, agrees to become a surrogate mother for a yuppie couple obsessed with power babyhood. But this time the results are comic -- "a tart and funny novel," one critic said last year.

HEADLINE: The Republicans: Can They Get It Together?

BYLINE: By Judith Miller; Judith Miller is the staff writer at The New York Times Magazine.

 BODY:
"You won't find any registered Democrats in this town," says Robert R. Pyle, the burly, pipe-smoking librarian of Northeast Harbor, Me., a picturesque resort village 180 miles up the coast from George Bush's summer retreat in Kennebunkport.
"If you encounter any, they were either abused by their mothers as children or they're from away," Pyle adds, deploying the local expression for those who've immigrated from someplace else. 
 The 46-year-old Pyle says his forebears "have been in these parts for a while." Since the Mayflower, in fact. The Republican Party seems equally well entrenched among Maine's 1.2 million residents, having been a dominant political force in the state since before the Civil War.
Before he was old enough to vote, Pyle campaigned for Barry Goldwater, then enthusiastically supported Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan and George Bush. He cheerfully acknowledges that he has never voted for a Democrat for President.
If anyone in America should be solidly behind George Bush, it should be a G.O.P. stalwart like Bob Pyle. But this November, Pyle has every intention of voting against George Bush. Which means that he will actually pull the lever for Bill Clinton.
"I feel like I'm turning against a friend," Pyle says hesitantly. "This is painful, hard stuff for me. And I feel sadness, frustration rather than anger. George Bush -- he's become isolated. He doesn't seem to know what the hell is happening to us.
"Since the middle of Reagan's term, and especially since Bush, the rich have gotten richer," he goes on. "The poor have gotten children, and the middle class, like me, have gotten poor. I'm a pro-lifer in principle, so it's not that issue that's driving me away. It's the economy. I know that higher taxes were necessary. I don't hold that against them. It's their insensitivity to its impact on people. George Bush is becoming the new Herbert Hoover."
Pyle says the Republican Party as a whole is as much to blame as George Bush. "The middle-class person doesn't have a voice in the party anymore," he says. "Before the special interests took control -- the PAC's, the wealthy contributors -- we did."
By embracing special interests, Pyle argues, the G.O.P. has betrayed its own philosophy. "We used to call a destitute person someone who was 'on the town,' " he recalls. "We solved our own problems at the local level. But today, the Federal Government takes over and does nothing for him. I would still prefer a system in which localities raise their own money and decide how to solve their own problems. We Mainers don't like to be interfered with. The best place to make a judgment about what is best for us begins with us. That was what Republicans used to believe. It was the Democrats who always favored a big central Government. I won't support four more years of the same."
Down the road at the Docksider Restaurant, Northeast Harbor's most popular seafood house, the air tingles with the aromas of boiling lobster and political defection. The Docksider's owners, sisters Brenda and Gail Webber, and two waitresses, Diana Leonaid and Ann Ritchie, are all "year-rounders," a designation that distinguishes them from the summer residents. They are also all registered Republicans who want a new Administration in Washington.
"It's time for some young blood, some new blood," Leonaid, a 47-year-old mother of two, says.
"We're all fiscal conservatives," says Brenda Webber, 49. "We don't like Government regulation and the soaring deficits and the tendency to look to Washington to solve problems. But we haven't lived up to our social responsibilities. Bush says things aren't that bad. Well, maybe they're not for him. But they are for us."
As the others nod their heads in fierce agreement, Ritchie, who has five children, chimes in: "George Bush and his party have total disregard for women. I mean none." All of the women, it turns out, favor abortion rights -- adamantly so.
Leonaid says she is a Republican today only because her parents were. "But being a Republican doesn't mean anything to me anymore."
IF THE REPUBLICAN bastion of Maine, which has only four electoral votes, were George Bush's only zone of geographic and ideological vulnerability, the Grand Old Party would have little cause for alarm. But on the eve of the Republican National Convention, which starts tomorrow in Houston, disenchantment with Bush can be heard all over the country -- from the very men and women who should be among his most ardent supporters.
Scores of interviews over the last six weeks with registered Republicans in four traditional G.O.P. strongholds -- Maine, Orange County, Calif., New Jersey and Mississippi, places that have almost invariably supported Republican national tickets since 1968 -- reflect not only bitter disappointment with George Bush, but also a party deeply divided against itself.
Under George Bush, the party that the late Republican strategist Lee Atwater dubbed the "big tent," is creaking and groaning from internal strains, contradictions and rivalries. According to Kevin Phillips, the Republican analyst, ever since the election of Richard Nixon in 1968, Republicans have captured the White House by building a coalition of ideologically diverse constituencies: first, Traditional Conservatives, sometimes called "country club" or "Rotary Club" Republicans (who represent about 25 percent of the party's voters); second, Ivy League Moderates, sometimes called Nelson Rockefeller Republicans (about 10 percent); third, the Religious Right, the fundamentalist true believers who seemed to worship Ronald Reagan as much as any deity (about 15 to 20 percent); fourth, the Reagan Democrats, the blue-collar workers who have voted Republican in the last three Presidential elections (20 percent); fifth, the Anti-Communist Ethnics, the Cubans, Vietnamese and other immigrant groups galvanized by this single issue (about 3 percent), and last but certainly not least, given their activism and influence, the Radical Right, a group that George Bush early in his political career called "the so-called nut fringe," but which he has assiduously courted ever since (about 5 percent). (The rest of the G.O.P. voters defy easy categorization.) For years these disparate constituencies were held together with the glue of prosperity and the common adversaries of cold war. But today they are bitterly at odds.
Self-identified Republicans -- as opposed to those who merely vote Republican -- are also torn by doctrinal battles. One is over how to fix the economy. Here, the party faithful are split into what Jack F. Kemp, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, calls "New Testament" and "Old Testament" factions -- supply-siders who favor stimulating growth through tax cuts and incentives (as Ronald Reagan did) versus those who argue that economic salvation is best achieved by balancing the budget and boldly eliminating the nation's crushing $4 trillion debt (as Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, the ranking Republican on the Budget Committee, does).
On social issues, like abortion, gay rights and prayer in the schools, the ideological fault line is between Republican traditionalists -- be they fiscal conservatives or moderates -- and the religious and ideological right. While abortion is the ostensible focus of the split, the real source is a far broader philosophical disagreement between those who oppose Government intervention in the private realm and those who favor it. In the 1988 Presidential campaign, economic well-being and Supreme Court protection of the right to an abortion camouflaged the split. But this year, the depressed economy and the Supreme Court decision that opened the door to the states' further limiting abortion rights, have widened and deepened it, leaving both sides feeling betrayed -- and furious at George Bush.
As right-wing influence within the G.O.P. solidifies in many states, moderates and even some conservatives warn that the great tent is now pitched so far to the right on "family values" issues that it is in danger of falling over. "My party, the party of Abraham Lincoln," a Republican abortion-rights activist laments, "has become the party of formaldehyde, condoms and fetus-wavers."
The leap of faith by about one-fourth of the electorate to Ross Perot, before many knew much about the billionaire Texas tycoon's personality and policy views, reflected voter anger at both parties -- but particularly at the G.O.P., from which many of Perot's predominantly white, male, suburban voters came.
Some White House officials initially assumed that because many Perot voters were Republicans, they would go back to their party after the Texan quit the race he never formally entered. But polls and interviews show that, so far, the opposite is true. Last month, the Field Poll of California showed former Perot supporters backing Clinton in that state 4 to 1. "The professionals may have underestimated the 'ABB' sentiment, 'Anybody but Bush,' says Tully Plesser, a Republican consultant.
If there is a bright spot for George Bush in all of this, it is that 74 percent of the electorate still describes itself as either politically "conservative" (32 percent) or "moderate" (42 percent), as opposed to the 20 percent which describes itself as "liberal." And while people mean very different things by those terms, Everett C. Ladd, director of the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research in Storrs, Conn., says that a defining feature of conservatism is skepticism about the capacity of Government to solve problems -- a trend that in Presidential contests tends to help Republicans, theoretically the party of Government minimalism.
Also, possible confrontations in Iraq and the Balkans might enable Bush to play "the military card," which could help him in November.
Another source of consolation for the Bush campaign is that many Republicans, despite their doubts about the President, remain suspicious both of Bill Clinton and the Democratic Party. "To us, Bill Clinton is like Gus Hall, a socialist." says James S. Todhunter, a businessman and conservative activist in Orange County, Calif. "So, of course, we'll support Bush."
Hazel Frank Gluck, a Republican consultant in Trenton, has come to the same conclusion for different reasons. "While we pro-choice Republicans are very disillusioned," she says, "it would be hard for me to vote Democratic."
But a large number of Republican voters interviewed express unqualified contempt for both Presidential candidates. "They're asking us to choose between a preppy tie and a hair dryer," says Jim Bright, a 42-year-old lobster fisherman in Northeast Harbor. Dick Koolhaas, who was born in Holland and for the past 18 years has run a feed store in Perris, Calif., blames both parties for what he calls "the mess we're in. I'm not making as much for my wife and four kids in a year as the Congress gave themselves in a single pay increase," he says with more than a trace of bitterness.
Republican strategists insist that by Election Day many of the disgruntled rank and file will end their political exile and return to the fold. They dismiss Bill Clinton's current 20-to-30-point lead over President Bush in the polls by citing surveys in which 34 percent of the voters say they might still switch their vote before Nov. 3.
But Kevin Phillips contends that the rumbling of discontent from Republicans is an unmistakable sign that a fundamental shift in voting patterns is under way. "Traditionally, Republicans have needed to get about 55 to 60 percent of the independents to win a Presidential election," Phillips says. "But that assumes your base is rock solid. And that's a big part of the problem. Different flavors of rock-rib Republicans are deserting Bush in droves, for very different reasons."
FOR Republicans, Orange County, Calif., has always been sacred territory. Its airport is named after John Wayne. Its main cultural attraction is Disneyland. It still hasn't gotten over Barry Goldwater's failure to win the Presidency in 1964. With 2.5 million residents, Orange County boasts one of the country's most expensive (though now flat) housing markets and a larger economy than most countries in Africa and South America. Since its creation more than a century ago, the county has been synonymous with affluent, loyalist Republicanism.
If any place should be George Bush country, it is conservative Orange County, among whose 1.1 million registered voters Republicans outnumber Democrats almost 2 to 1. But in this strange political year, the President cannot take even Orange County for granted. A poll in mid-July, conducted by The Orange County Register immediately after Perot's withdrawal, found Bush trailing his Democratic opponent Bill Clinton by 42.1 to 34.8 percent. The Register announced its findings as the third in an incredible series of developments over the last three years: "Berlin Wall falls. McDonald's opens in Moscow. Democratic Presidential challenger Bill Clinton is ahead in overwhelmingly Republican Orange County."
Why are Orange County Republicans joining so many other G.O.P. voters across the country in questioning their allegiance to -- and even deserting -- George Bush? First and foremost, the President has drawn the wrath of ultraconservatives here with his unpopular 1990 Congressional budget agreement that broke his "Read My Lips" pledge not to raise taxes.
But even more damaging to the Administration's standing, the recession has plunged Orange County, along with the rest of California, into one of the worst economic slumps since the Depression. Unemployment statewide is more than 1.5 percent above the national average of 7.8 percent. Aerospace, real estate and banking, three perennially booming sectors, are virtually at a standstill. Two weeks ago, the influential Register charged the President with having "failed every bit as much as that last notable failure, Jimmy Carter" and called on him to quit the race.
"What we have here in California is not merely a bad recession, we are experiencing a restructuring of the economy," says Larry Thomas, a former press secretary to then-Vice President Bush and now a senior vice president at the Irvine Company, a private developer and the county's single largest landowner. "We are not going to 'come back' in the usual sense. So people are going through an emotional process similar to a death in the family -- denial, anger, resentment and eventual acceptance. The problem is that the election is occurring in the midst of this cycle."
A Republican Assemblyman, Gil Ferguson of Newport Beach, one of the county's wealtiest communities, says that people are scared. "The biggest business in Orange County these days is moving vans -- immigrants and people dependent on the state for welfare, education and health care moving in, and businesses moving out, fleeing our burdensome regulations."
In a two-way Presidential race, Orange County must deliver a 300,000-vote surplus "to carry Sodom and Gomorrah in the rest of the state," Ferguson says, referring to San Francisco and Central Los Angeles, which vote heavily Democratic. Thus, Republicans would not only have to sustain their 231,000-vote margin in the county, but also cut into about a fifth of the Democratic vote -- no mean task, given the grim G.O.P. mood. "I don't see conservatives breaking their necks for Bush," Ferguson says. "I don't see the foot soldiers coming out for him. They're very independent-minded -- real conservatives, not wishy-washy Republicans. And George Bush has broken every pledge he made to them, all except abortion."
The lack of enthusiasm for Bush among the foot soldiers was unmistakable at a recent meeting in Garden Grove of the Orange County Coordinating Republican Assembly, the conservative caucus. "Look, George Bush broke his word and raised taxes," James Todhunter says. "We screamed the loudest and hardest about that. Bush's campaign slogan ought to be: 'I'm really, really, really sorry. Honest.' "
Debra Allen, a conservative who is running for a judgeship, says she will support the President's re-election -- but only secondarily. "We'll work for Bush, because all of us will be out there working as hard as we can to elect Bruce Herschensohn to the United States Senate. So while we're out canvassing and registering voters for Bruce, we'll be carrying Bush-Quayle literature as well."
An incumbent Republican President is in trouble, political professionals say, when he must rely on the "upward coattails" of an ultraconservative former television commentator and candidate for the Senate to carry a state with 54 critical electoral votes.
At party headquarters in neighboring Costa Mesa, there were also few vital signs. "The volunteers are all out," says Greg Haskin, the executive director of the Republican Party of Orange County, surveying his small, silent office. "Well," Haskin adds tentatively, "we are a little frustrated that the campaign has yet to take shape. The issues of the race have not been defined yet. We're still in a holding pattern. We're ready to go, of course. Rarin' to go, in fact. But until we get our marching orders, there's little we can do. Where are our marching orders?"
AT TIPPY'S charcoal Haven, a 1950's-style, neon-studded fast-food joint on the main drag in Jersey City, two men who declare themselves Reagan Democrats are talking politics. Frank Sclafani, who worked until recently in the shipping division of Colgate-Palmolive, and Frank Giordano, a burly, semiretired hairdresser with a weight lifter's physique, both voted Republican in 1988, as they did in 1980 and 1984. It is bad news for George Bush that neither intends to do so this year. Like most voters in New Jersey and throughout the Northeast, they were never really taken with Ross Perot. "He didn't make that much money being a saint," says Giordano, a Tippy's regular. Sclafani agrees. "Perot's a fraud. But Bush is despicable.
"Bush let Hitler stay on in power," Sclafani says, a less than oblique reference to the President's failure to oust Saddam Hussein from Iraq during the gulf war. Sclafani's son, who graduated from West Point in 1990, served in Saudi Arabia and only recently returned. "I don't understand why George Bush always seems to run away from strength," Sclafani goes on. "For a guy who crashed in the Pacific in combat and survived, he's got no sense of manifest destiny."
New Jersey, the quintessential suburban state with the third-highest per capita income in America, should be solidly pro-Bush. In the last Presidential election, the President got 56.2 percent of the vote. Since World War II, New Jersey voters have supported a Democrat for the White House only twice.
"The most notable feature of political life in New Jersey in the past decade has been the growth in the Republican Party," concludes Alan Rosenthal, director of the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University. Yet New Jersey's 7.7 million people also tend to be fairly progressive, independent-minded ticket splitters who elect Democrats to Capitol Hill and to the State House, as they did three years ago -- to the regret of many -- with Gov. Jim Florio.
Polls and interviews in New Jersey suggest that in the Garden State, George Bush is in trouble. "We've lost 289,000 jobs in the past three years -- almost half of the job gains we made during the boom of the 80's," says Assemblyman Robert D. Franks, the state party chairman. "Per capita income here, when adjusted for inflation, shrank last year for the first time in almost a decade. Business and personal bankruptcies have hit all-time highs. And our unemployment rate is now 9 percent -- more than a point above the national average." The latest Asbury Park Press poll, last month, shows Clinton leading Bush, 50 to 25 percent.
"I voted for Bush as a continuation of the Ronald Reagan era," Sclafani continues, sipping a mug of Tippy's coffee. "Reagan restored the dignity and military strength our nation had lost in Vietnam. He wasn't afraid to call the Soviet Union evil. Sure, he helped create some of the economic problems we have today, but history will be kind to him. He and the Republicans got rid of Communism."
Giordano recalls the days when most of the residents of predominantly white, ethnic Jersey City were Democrats. "But most of us changed with Reagan in 1980," he says. "I'm not afraid to say I think family values are important to me, that pornography disturbs me, yes it does. That crime in the streets bothers me. Republicans talked about those issues. Democrats didn't."
But unlike Democratic Presidential candidates of the past, Sclafani and Giordano agree, Bill Clinton is talking about these issues. And both men loved Clinton's attack on the rap performer Sister Souljah, who after the Los Angeles riots suggested rhetorically that those who commit black-on-black homicides every day ought to devote a week to killing whites. Giordano says he's not surewhether he will even vote this year. Like many Reagan Democrats in this state, he is furious at Governor Florio, whose huge income tax increase three years ago reinforced his fears about the "tax and spend" Democrats.
But Giordano's friend Sclafani is looking hard at Clinton -- one of a growing number of Reagan Democrats around the country who might become Clinton Republicans in November. William Schneider, a political analyst at the American Enterprise Institute and CNN, says most polls and focus groups show that of all Republican voters, Reagan Democrats are most likely to shift allegiance to Clinton. Four years ago, about half of them did, in fact, abandon Bush for Gov. Michael Dukakis. Schneider and many other campaign strategists say that it is swing voters like Sclafani and Giordani who will decide the election.
CHARLES EDWARDS and his son Jason fix cars for a living in D'Lo, Miss., a tiny speck on the state map that the main highway passed by a decade ago. "We keep voting for change, but it's been so slow in comin' that we can't even see it," says Charles Edwards, 53, who voted for Bush in 1988. "I'm sure Bush is a good man, but he's not in touch with mainstream America. We've got to shut down all this overseas stuff. I don't want to leave any more debt to these children than they already have."
Jason, 22, has been getting news of this year's political campaign from MTV, which, he says, he watches regularly since there isn't much to do in D'Lo other than "eat, drink beer and go into Jackson 30 miles away on weekends." Jason says he is leaning to Clinton-Gore at this point, because "it's kind of appealing to have two Southerners who might be a little more focused on us."
Some Republican strategists fear that the all-Southern Democratic ticket will end the G.O.P.'s Presidential winning streak in Mississippi and other Deep South states. But Clarke Reed, the head of Mississippi's Bush-Quayle re-election campaign, disputes the pessimism. He insists that both Clinton and Gore are out of sync with the bedrock values of the region. "They're both too slick to be relating to the real Baptist culture here," Reed says. "Too yuppie to be fallin' on their knees."
Reed also quarrels with the conventional wisdom that the Republican ticket will be hurt in Mississippi by the state's sagging economy. The reason is a classic case of diminished expectations. "Sure the economy is bad, but it's always bad," Reed says. For years, Mississippi has ranked at the bottom among all states in income, literacy and health.
Mississippi may well rank first, however, when it comes to old-fashioned, flag-waving patriotism. This state sent a higher percentage of young people to the gulf war than nearly any other. "We love the Commander in Chief thing down here," Reed says.
More than a dozen faded "Support Our Troops in Desert Storm" bumper stickers can be seen in the parking lot of the Northpark Mall in Ridgeland, a white-flight suburb of Jackson that has been solidly Republican for two decades. In the mall, one finds that rarity in the political universe nowadays -- strong support for George Bush. "I respect Bush because he let the military handle the gulf war and didn't interfere,"' says 25-year-old Mary Frederick, who works in one of the mall's jewelry stores. "And you just can't blame the economy on Bush. Congress is to blame, too. They wouldn't let him do what he wanted to."
One of the few truly safe harbors for the much-buffeted Bush re-election ship appears to be within the community of evangelical, or fundamentalist, Christian churches in and around Jackson. Here, being a Republican is what many parishioners call a "life-style decision."
"Family values is what motivates a lot of us," says the Rev. Stanley Wachtstetter, the pastor of the Bible Tabernacle Church, in Clinton. It is with this rubric that the Republicans, chiefly Vice President Quayle, have effectively tapped into the evangelicals' staunch opposition to abortion, gay rights and other tolerance issues. Among men and women alike in Mississippi, being against abortion is next to godliness.
Wachtstetter says that rumors about Bill Clinton's drug experimentation and marital conduct are "too flagrant, too blatant" for evangelicals to ignore. "We're not really single-issue people," Wachtstetter says, "because family values -- religion, child care, abortion, how we treat the elderly -- are not single issues."
And yet while most of his parishioners share his views, not all share his unstinting support for the President. "I'm gonna probably hold my nose and vote for Bush," says Byron Duran, a carpenter who voted Republican in 1988. "As a Christian, the Democratic platform is about as anti-God as you can get -- for abortion, for gay rights. But our economy is in real trouble, and Bush always seems to have economic plans for some other people somewhere else in the world."
Again and again, the churchgoers say they don't like the Clinton alternative because the Democrats are "too liberal." But they also express a yearning for a "real leader." Nathan Triplett, 22, says he wishes that Ronald Reagan were running again. "He didn't compromise," he says. "I knew where he stood, and nobody could beat him."
A PRESIDENT WHOSE core constituency base has been reduced to evangelicals is a politician in trouble. And George Bush has only made matters worse by trying to appease both the traditionalists and the right wing within his party. "Bush, a moderate by nature, made a fundamental mistake in 1982 by trying to clone Ronald Reagan," says Rita E. Hauser, a prominent New York Republican who supports abortion rights. By tilting toward moderate-conservatives on some issues like tenant management of public housing and, by political calculation, to the radical right on others, most notably abortion, the President has wound up being trusted by neither side.
If the fight over abortion within the G.O.P. has done nothing else, it has energized the Republican center -- especially women -- a major segment of the party that had been steadily losing influence for the last three decades. "At some point, I realized that what was at stake here was my being comfortable within my own party," says Hazel Gluck, the Republican consultant from New Jersey. "When I was heckled at my own convention for supporting the Equal Rights Amendment, I realized that things had gone too far."
Eileen E. Padberg, a Republican strategist 3,000 miles away in Irvine, Calif., voices similar feelings. "I'm a true-blue conservative and Republican," Padberg says. "But increasingly I ask myself: What are those people doing in the party of Abraham Lincoln, of individual freedom and privacy, of separation of church and state? And what is George Bush doing on their side instead of ours?"
The answer may not reassure them. A series of New York Times/ CBS News polls conducted in June and July show that while many Americans oppose Government interference in the lives of individuals, a majority of Republicans and Democrats alike believe that the Federal Government should help "uphold traditional family values." In addition, only one-third of the Republicans sampled say abortion should be "generally available," while some 60 percent oppose using tax dollars to pay for it for poor women.
But the Padbergs of the party say they will not surrender, even if they lose their fight to overturn the party platform endorsing constitutional restrictions on abortion. They argue that their cause is just, not only on principle but on political grounds. The flight to Perot among Republicans earlier this year, they point out, tended to be heaviest in areas that were not only economically depressed, but also dominated by the radical right. In New Jersey, where the party is controlled by self-described moderates, a Perot groundswell never materialized. But in Orange County, where Perot support was extremely strong, ultraconservatives have long been in control. And in the Republican primary two months ago, Padberg and other challengers to the entrenched right wing were denounced by ultraconservatives as "lesbian spear chuckers."
Ann E. W. Stone, chairwoman of Republicans for Choice and one of the party's most tenacious activists, says that in Washington State, where support for Perot was also strong, the party has been virtually taken over by "zealots who have passed resolutions calling for bans on pornography, witchcraft and yoga."
"We're going to take this party back to its roots," says Stone. "We're going to stop the trend towards church fascism, the tail from wagging the dog. No matter what happens to Bush-Quayle in November, this war will go on."

HEADLINE: To Budapest Mit Schlag

BYLINE: By By Marian Burros; Marian Burros is a food columnist for The New York Times.

 BODY:
It is the perfect setting for a Sigmund Romberg operetta: a Renaissance Revival building of palatial proportions idyllically situated on the edge of a city park, with a zoo at its backdoor and a lake at its front. Sometimes the air is filled with the sound of music, sometimes with the trumpeting of elephants.
But for decades the building in Budapest might as well have been a facade on a Hollywood sound stage. Its imposing exterior concealed the remains of a restaurant that was once the finest east of Vienna. Gundel, the gathering place of the bourgeoisie and the aristocracy when the Danube was still blue and Archduke Ferdinand had not yet been to Sarajevo, had survived two world wars, various occupations, revolutions and counterrevolutions and three months as a stable for Wehrmacht horses, but 45 years of Communist rule brought it to its knees. Inside it looked like a 1950's cafeteria, and the food it dispensed made K-rations seem appetizing. 
 On May 22, 1992, Gundel (pronounced GOON-del) was reborn. Its revival has become a symbol of the country's former glamour, giving Hungarians something to celebrate, even though few of them can afford the joie de vivre dispensed there for $30 to $40 a person. But, for the moment, George Lang, one of the partners in the restaurant, is not counting on the city's residents to fill the tables at Gundel. The Hungarian-born Lang, a successful restaurant consultant and owner of Cafe des Artistes in New York, has turned the operetta facade into a glamorous reality for well-heeled tourists, foreign business travelers and their local guests.
Lang fled Hungary in 1946, after escaping from a forced-labor camp in 1944. None of his immediate family survived the war. It has been a triumphal return. "This is the pinnacle of his career," said Andrew Young, a consultant who has worked with Lang in the past. "He is introducing a whole new way of food and management to a country that has been backward all these years."
So far, Lang's improbable adventure has cost between $15 million and $20 million, most of it coming from his partner, Ronald S. Lauder, the cosmetic-empire heir and former Ambassador to Austria. Lang describes the experience of restoring a national treasure in an Eastern European country as a mix of Grand Guignol and soap opera. Hyperbole is to Hungarians what understatement is to New Englanders.
Joseph Wechsberg, the writer and food connoisseur, was not given to hyperbole. He credits Karoly Gundel, who ran the restaurant for almost 40 years, with contributing "more to the fame of Hungarian cooking than any other man." Writing in "Blue Trout and Black Truffles," Wechsberg said Karoly Gundel was "ranked by connoisseurs all over the world in a class with such restaurateurs as Escoffier and Fernand Point." Point was chef and owner of what arguably was once the finest restaurant in the world, La Pyramide in France.
Lang agrees, describing Gundel as "the greatest restaurateur that Hungary ever produced," a combination of Ritz, Escoffier and Prosper Montagne.
Gundel absorbed the hospitality business at his father's hotel in Budapest and then apprenticed in Switzerland and Germany, where he met the famous Swiss hotelman Cesar Ritz, who took him to Paris and London.
In 1910 Gundel purchased a restaurant in the city park and named it for himself. It was not long before the rechristened establishment had an international reputation, and when King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy visited Hungary in 1937, Gundel and his staff cooked for him at the castle where he stayed, adding to the restaurant's cachet. Despite its decline under the Communists, Gundel's reputation survived, and visiting connoisseurs continued to make pilgrimages. They left disappointed.
Lang knew both the food and the setting needed a complete overhaul. He consulted his old friend, the designer Milton Glaser, who helped devise a master plan. The first idea was to re-create that period between the two world wars, when where you sat at Gundel was determined by your station in life, your patronage of the restaurant and your knowledge of food. Karoly Gundel explained to Wechsberg: "People with good food and wine manners would in due time graduate to the terrace," where the socially and otherwise prominent dined, a few steps up from the garden, which was for the ordinary patrons.
But the era's Mitteleuropa style -- fanciful, baroque, luxurious -- was rejected as too sumptuous for late 20th-century tastes. "Vienna Secessionist is very opulent, very decorative, very sexy," said Adam D. Tihany, a designer of the restaurant who was born in Transylvania and is now an American. "We felt it would not sit well, so we went back to sometime between the 1880's and 1920's." The result, says Tihany, "is something that never existed, but you would have felt comfortable in it 100 years ago. We had to create a fantasy. We reconstituted it from the blue air."
The appointments of the 200-seat dining room span the decades, from Belle Epoque through early Art Deco -- from the lush to the linear, with polished rosewood paneling and a coffered plaster ceiling with three elaborate layers of plaster molding. The wrought-iron and brass railings are typically Belle Epoque, the chairs are almost Biedermeier.
With a raised platform and strategic configuration of the blue silk banquettes, the room seems cozy and intimate. The muted gold fabrics on the walls and the carpet with its elephant motif (in honor of the zoo) give it the patina of restoration instead of the glitz of something new.
The second-floor ballroom, which could have been the Czar's summer palace -- dazzling white-and-gold rococo with five Venetian crystal chandeliers and heavy gold and red damask drapes -- was designed by Kornel Baliga, a young Hungarian architect.
In the garden at night, an orchestra plays under an umbrella of trees outlined in thousands of tiny lights.
Not all of the decor is exactly Tihany's taste. "Borderline kitsch," he says.
"Opening up a restaurant of this complexity," says Lang, as he sits in his tiny office, "is one of the pleasures and nightmares of all times. It is a cross between being a Medici and living in a surrealist world."
Lang has come a long way since he arrived in the United States intending to be a violinist. Lacking the talent to be another Jascha Heifetz, he moved on to the restaurant business. Along the way, this short, stocky, bald man with penetrating blue eyes picked up skills as an author, photographer, calligrapher, designer of tableware and cook. He lives in New York with his third wife, Jenifer; they have a 5-year-old son, Simon.
Lang is not modest -- "only good-for-nothings are modest," he says. And he seldom gives short answers to questions, peppering them with references to the past and to his famous friends, especially in the music world. "Name-dropping," says one Hungarian, "is very Hungarian."
Some colleagues at Gundel refer to Lang as King George, and, aware of this teasing, he sometimes appropriates it. One day, as he sits for his portrait in the splendor of the restaurant's gilded ballroom, he describes himself as "the almost benevolent, almost dictator."
Doing business in Hungary has required infinite patience and a sense of the absurd. Near the end of the construction, only a bunker-style office building erected by the Communists next to Gundel intruded on Lang's fairy-tale kingdom. Three days before the opening, the ugly building still needed to be painted. In most places, if you want to paint a building you own, you pick a color and hire a painter. Not in Budapest.
Lang: I want the building painted by Friday. When can you start?
Laszlo Somogyi, supervisor of construction at Gundel and former minister of construction and urban development under the Communists: The law in Hungary is that you cannot paint stone.
Lang: You are kidding.
Somogyi: No.
Lang: We are painting it and if there is any problem it is my problem.
Somogyi: O.K. We paint but it is against the law.
Lang: Who made this stupid law?
Somogyi: The law was made by me.
Laughter throughout the room.
Lang: O.K. You can take a few Valium . . . and then paint the building.
TIHANY LIKENS THE re-creation of Gundel to a military operation. "We called it Budapest Storm," he says. And since this is Hungary, everything takes longer because everyone has something to say. "If there are 10 people," says Tihany, "there are 20 opinions."
Four electricians are putting up the chandelier in the restaurant's foyer. Decorative chains are to be connected from the center post to what Tihany calls "the squiggles" at the edges of the fixture.
"What are the chains for?" asks one of the electricians.
Tihany explains that they are part of the design.
"It's not nice," says the electrician. "I don't like it with the chains. It looks better this way."
"I'm sorry you don't like it," says Tihany, maintaining his cool. "But put it up."
"I don't take orders from you," says the electrician. "Only from Mr. Somogyi."
Tihany fetches the burly construction boss, who tells the electricians: "You must put it up exactly as Mr. Tihany said."
Then he turns to Tihany: "Why do you want the chain. It looks better without it."
There is only one way to end this discussion: Pull rank. "I want the chain," Tihany says, and it is installed.
The five-minute task has consumed half a day.
This is one of the few discussions in which Lang is not involved. Only because he is elsewhere at the time. Little escapes his critical eye. One of the details he has fixed on is the color of the kitchen floor tiles -- a ruddy beige.
"It is a filthy, ugly color," he says, as he shows off the kitchen. At the staff meeting the next morning he asks how they got stuck with the unspeakable color.
Told that the color was deliberately chosen to conceal dirt, he sputters: "You are joking. I can't imagine how they sell this damn thing. I am so disturbed. I came back last night at midnight and scrubbed the damn thing like half an hour. I don't care if we have to break it up. I don't want the damn thing."
Though he hasn't torn out the floor, his desire for perfection and his legendary temper, which he freely acknowledges, frighten many of the employees.
"He is demanding," says Kalman Kalla, who was chef at the Hungarian embassy in Washington before he took the post at Gundel. "He has a finger in every pie and he knows about everything. Many of my colleagues are scared in front of him and don't dare say anything to him. He has a temper but most of the time he is very polite. Before he comes, the people in the kitchen say, 'The beast is coming.' "
Instead of a grand opening, Gundel eased into operation with a few small parties. To work out cooking kinks and to make sure the staff had absorbed Western-style courtesy and learned enough English to converse with foreign guests, Lang held a series of tasting dinners and lunches for friends of the owners living in or traveling through Budapest.
It has been difficult convincing the staff that food preparation has changed in the 40-odd years they have been locked up in a Communist culinary time warp: that Westerners like their fish moist, not dry, their meat pink not gray, their vegetables crisp but tender. Those who have dined at Gundel in the months since it has opened say the food is quite good, certainly without compare in Eastern Europe.
Like Karoly Gundel, Lang mixes Hungarian dishes with those that would be described today as Continental: prosciutto and melon; mushrooms stuffed with wild mushrooms; rare roasted breast of duck; chateaubriand with bearnaise sauce and potatoes Anna; fogas, the famous local fish; gulyas, a meat soup; catfish baked with sauerkraut and fish sausage (an 18th-century recipe). Goose liver, as beloved in Hungary as foie gras is in France, is prepared five different ways. For dessert there is strudel, crepes Gundel style with walnuts, chocolate and rum as well as strawberries with strawberry ice cream and espresso parfait.
Lang is never satisfied. But when he writes notes to the kitchen staff after a tasting lunch, he mixes praise with criticism.
"For a first-time cooking in a kitchen, it was quite remarkable," he wrote in a May 14 memorandum.
"Double breast of chicken:
"A. Chicken was way overcooked. As I mentioned to you before, chicken (especially breast) and shrimp should be cooked exactly half the length that seems logical.
"B. Gauffrettes potatoes were soggy. (When they were fried, they seemed fine.)
"C. Thank heaven, the asparagus was cooked properly.
"D. Cauliflower and Brussels sprouts seemed like a product from an English kitchen: they were just boiled (though fortunately not overboiled); we must discuss this because it needs something extra."
Having the dishes cooked and served just the way Lang wants them is only part of the culinary task in a country where, until a few years ago, everything seemed to come in a pink sauce piped out of a central commissary.
Sources for ingredients have to be cultivated. A vineyard in the famous Tokay region has been purchased to assure a consistent supply of the country's most famous wine. A distiller is making apricot brandy, the preferred before-dinner drink in Hungary, under the Gundel label, and a paprika producer is packaging three types of the seasoning for the restaurant and its gift shop. Lang's Hungarian organization, Langastronomia, K.F.T., the umbrella company for Lang and Lauder's Hungarian businesses, is negotiating to buy a farm to produce goose liver.
Lang is also trying to install an American tipping system, but it is not working well. Europeans, accustomed to having service included, either fail to notice or ignore the discreet wording on the menus that says the tip is not included. With only the Americans tipping well, the waiters say they are not making enough money.
These problems are minor compared with those that faced Lang and Lauder when they first sought to buy the restaurant. It took more than a year after they approached the Hungarian State Property Agency, responsible for privatizing what the Communist Government had appropriated over the previous decades, to close the deal. Following Kafkaesque negotiations, they took title in September 1991. Reconstruction began in November; the restaurant opened in May. Not bad in a land stuck somewhere between Communist bureaucracy and the West's free-market economy.
It's doubtful the Hungarian Government knew that Gundel was a national treasure until George Lang and Ronald Lauder said they wanted to buy it. "No one cared about the restaurant in the privatization," said Gabor Buday, managing director of Langastronomia. "Politicians forgot about the fame Gundel got for Hungary before the war," he said.
That does not mean that Hungary's State Property Agency was anxious to get rid of Gundel. They put an $8 million price tag on it, with the investors and the Government to each own half. This prospect did not appeal to either Lang or Lauder.
The details of how Lang finally got what he wanted remain hazy because Lang chooses to keep them that way.
"So what am I going to tell you?" he says when asked about the negotiations. "How I made 25 different moves; how I made a 125-page gold-embossed hard-cover book about Gundel that I sent the the Ministry of Property; how I researched the goddamn thing?"
Finally the state agreed to sell 50 percent of the restaurant to him and Lauder. Just days before the closing they called and offered all of it. Lang and Lauder took it.
AND THEN THERE were the Gundel heirs to consider. Lang says the Government would have given them an insignificant amount of money; Lang and Lauder felt they owed them more. "Ronald and I felt extremely strongly that morally we couldn't use the name without their permission," said Lang, "and we wanted them to get some money."
How much? Lang will only say, "significant in Hungarian terms." A year ago Lang swore the Gundel heirs to secrecy and a promise that any statements made to the press would be positive. But someone close to the 36 Gundel heirs said they received around $500,000 in total -- $200,000 from the Government, the rest from Lang and Lauder, considerably less than two of the Gundel grandchildren thought was appropriate. "They smelled a killing," according to Lang, "and went to a lawyer and convinced the family they could get $1 million or $2 million more.
"I got to the point where I said, now is the time to act. I invited about 40 of the family, and we had dinner on the terrace. It was a lovely, friendly dinner.
"After dinner I made a speech and I said, 'I will make an offer but it must be agreed to unanimously,' and then I showed them the ad that I would create for the restaurant when it opened if they did not agree. The ad would say: 'Wampetich, formerly Gundel.'
"There was absolute dead silence."
Lang had played his trump card. Wampetich was the name of the restaurant when Karoly Gundel bought it in 1910.
Janos Gundel, a grandson of Karoly, was reluctant to talk about what happened. "We had some problems," he said. "Yes, I think it upset us to think he would not use the name.
"Of course, it would have been much better if we could continue our grandfather's tradition, but the whole family was very happy that the tradition is in good hands."
Gundel, the restaurant, is only the beginning. Products like the apricot brandy, paprika and chocolate tortes are being sold under the Gundel label in a boutique in the foyer. There will be a cooking school and, possibly, a student exchange program with the Culinary Institute of America. The off-premises catering is already more profitable than the restaurant. Even more ambitious are the plans to open several Gundels around the world.
Asked to explain why, at 68, he would take on this monumental and often frustrating project, Lang pauses for a long time before answering. "It must be in your genes when you have to prove yourself over and over again," he says.
Then he looks away, his voice breaking. "I don't know. I guess I want to justify that I was the only one who survived."

HEADLINE: ARTS/ARTIFACTS;
Silver, Jade and Bronzes Hold Their Own on the Block

BYLINE: By RITA REIF

 BODY:
In the lackluster art market of the 1990's, historically important objects, especially those with a royal pedigree, are thriving. Several of the most impressive items have commanded exceptional, even record prices at recent auctions in New York, Monte Carlo and Hong Kong.
The costliest -- a cradle-shaped Imperial Easter egg made in 1905 by Peter Carl Faberge -- brought $3.2 million earlier this summer at Sotheby's in New York. Made for Czar Nicholas II to give to his wife, Alexandra, on the birth of their son Alexei, the bejeweled and blue-enameled bauble rewrote the record at auction for a Faberge work. Neither the seller nor the buyer was identified. 
 On June 25, also at Sotheby's, most everyone was astonished at the bidding war between two Japanese dealers over a gilded silver wine vessel, probably made for a Sassanian king of ancient Persia to give to a nobleman in the seventh century. The winner, Noriyoshi Horiuchi of Tokyo, paid $1.9 million, more than 10 times the presale estimate, setting a record at auction for any ancient Near Eastern artwork.
Birdlike in form with a beaked spout, the ewer, decorated with scrolls and leaves, cost a mere $25,000 in the 1960's, when it was bought by J. J. Klejman, a New York dealer. The unidentified Klejman family member who sold it in June benefited from recent scholarship on the other six known Sassanian vessels.
Prudence O. Harper, the curator of ancient Near Eastern art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, had studied the six previously known examples. She started with the Metropolitan's silver version, embellished with dancing girls, and went on to those at the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris and at the Hermitage in St. Petersburg.
"The Sassanian ewer is a very distinctive form of vessel," Mrs. Harper said. The extant examples were madeduring the sixth and seventh centuries, from Iran to Central Asia. "The one at Sotheby's was a very large late example, mid-seventh century. It's not by chance that a high price was spent for this luxury object."
When collectors and dealers assembled in Monte Carlo on June 21 for a Sotheby's auction, the talk was mostly about a rococo coffeepot, made in 1757 by Francoise-Thomas Germaine of Paris for King Jose I of Portugal. The pear-shaped pot, its spout and handle shaped like coffee leaves and beans, established a record for French silver -- $1.6 million, four times Sotheby's expectations. Auctioned from the collection of Arturo Lopez-Willshaw, the Chilean-born heir who died in 1962, the vessel was bought by an unidentified buyer.
"It was the best coffeepot you could get -- absolutely fabulous," said the dealer who lost out in the bidding, Martin Norton of S. J. Phillips in London. "There is a recession, but the very best things in the European silver market have kept their prices."
Of the six pots Germaine made for the king, four are in two Lisbon museums with the rest of the king's magnificent service, and one is at the Metropolitan. "I polish that coffeepot every 12 months, and it's a high point of my year," said Clare Le Corbeiller, an associate curator at the Metropolitan. "It's one of the great works of French silver in its rhythm, texture, richness, discipline, grace and scale. You've got polished surfaces, matte surfaces and spirals going in different directions. And yet it's controlled. It just sings."
Several aristocratic Oriental artworks also produced heated bidding. An 18th-century Imperial marriage bowl, carved of white jade, was recently sold by Christie's in Hong Kong for $597,700 to an unidentified Taiwan buyer. The price was a record for white-jade carving. Then, a 16th-century Korean lacquer box, made for an emperor or high-placed official, sold for $550,000 at Christie's in New York. "It's very rare to find a document box in good condition," said Yoshinori Munemura, an Oriental art specialist at Christie's.
Also at Christie's this summer, a rare pair of silver inlaid bronzes of mythical beasts, made about the third century B.C. to serve as the corner mounts of an ancient Chinese vessel, brought $550,000. "All those inlaid vessels were found in royal tombs," said Philip Constantinidi of Eskenazi, the London dealer who bought the mounts. "I don't think any other pair has been on the market since World War II."
No royal connection has been uncovered for the golf club that Titus Kendall, a London dealer, bought last month for $175,400, the highest price ever realized for an auctioned golf item. But the 300-year-old putting iron, with a curved blade and an ash shaft, is a historical artifact. It's one of the earliest known examples.
"Golf was always an expensive sport," Mr. Kendall said. Found recently in a garden shed in Scotland, Sotheby's auctioned the golf club at Musselburgh, near Edinburgh. The dealer bought it for the Valderamma Golf Club in Sotto Grande, Spain.
"Ordinary 19th-century clubs have decreased in price about 20 percent," said Jon Baddeley, the Christie's auctioneer who sold it. "But when a rarity appears, buyers will pay whatever it takes."

HEADLINE: Perspectives: West Side Development;
Capital Cities/ABC Plans New Studios

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
THINK of it as as an urban television "back lot," says Capital Cities/ABC, trying to describe the expansion it plans on vacant land behind an existing studio building on the West Side. In the front lot, along West End Avenue from 64th to 65th Streets, there would be three residential towers of 39 stories, with 930 apartments and a 350-car garage.
The company is in the preliminary review phase in the Department of City Planning on a proposal to build two 15,000-square-foot television studios plus support space behind the existing studio, which is at 320 West 66th Street. Public land-use review is expected to begin in October. 
 The residential section would architecturally complement the already approved 1,000-unit Manhattan West project of the Brodsky Organization just south of the Capital Cities/ ABC land, on West End Avenue from 61st to 64th Street. Groundbreaking on that development is scheduled for next year.
It is hard to think of a corporate analogue to the role in Manhattan development that Capital Cities/ABC is taking. Well before American Broadcasting Companies was acquired by Capital Cities Communications Inc. in 1986, it was expanding and shifting about on the West Side, buying property, leasing space, building new and rehabilitating the old, in one real-estate transaction after another over 30 years. But in the latest proposal, it is showing itself in a more unusual role -- working to rezone land for residential use.
Company officials acknowledge that Capital Cities/ABC may not be the builder. Once approved for residential use the land may be resold.
The site is part of a eight-acre tract once owned by The New York Times. The Times used the building at the north end of the tract for production and distribution, and sold the full parcel to Harry B. Helmsley in 1979 when it moved those operations to New Jersey.
In 1982 Mr. Helmsley sold the building and land behind it to Capital Cities/ABC -- a total of two acres. The company rehabilitated the West End Avenue building, No. 125, for the headquarters of ABC's radio networks and other functions, and built the 320 West 66th Street studio where a power house formerly stood.
The rest of the property Mr. Helmsley sold to the Brodsky Organization in 1985. But a year later Brodsky sold off the two northerly acres to Capital Cities/ABC. This is the land now under planning review.
Richard E. Hockman, vice president for real estate and construction, has been at ABC through most of its wanderings, going back to days when Leonard Goldenson was chairman. Mr. Goldenson built ABC from a small network purchased from Edward Noble, the "Life Saver king," in 1953.
CORPORATE headquarters moved from the Upper West Side to midtown in the 60's -- to 1330 Avenue of the Americas, on 54th Street across the avenue from the New York Hilton. But production activities remained uptown.
"It took 20 years to decide that it was unwise to split the company physically," said Mr. Hockman. A plan was hatched to build an elaborate one-million-square-foot headquarters between 66th and 68th Street, and Columbus Avenue and Broadway. The site was assembled, but in the 80's the plan was dropped. Instead, in 1989, the company built 77 West 66th Street, a building of 400,000 square feet at the Columbus Avenue end of a block filled with an assortment of ABC properties. The Avenue of the Americas building was sold to the Shuwa Corporation of Japan for $175 million in 1986.
The northern portion of the land assembled for the canceled headquarters was sold to Millenium Partners for a $234 million mixed-use tower, currently in construction. Capital Cities/ABC still holds the triangularly shaped southern block, between 66th and 67th Streets, but Millienium Partners has an option to buy it.
The emphasis now is on expanding capacity to produce shows -- rather than licensing others to produce them, said Robert T. Goldman, vice president for administration. "Where to do it? The only places are Los Angeles or New York, where the writers, the producers, the on-air talent is," he said. "We've got $125 million invested in our West End Avenue facilities already. We can service two more studios by adding on."
At present, the network has two studios at the location, with 23,000 square feet of space. But the supporting space includes only 1,000 square feet as the staging area -- where trucks can turn around. By industry standards turnaround space should roughly equal studio space.
Capital Cities/ABC is a major New York City employer. It occupies a total of 2.8 million square feet of space citywide, owning 1.7 million square feet of it and leasing the rest. Sixty-three percent of its space is on the West Side. The company paid $23.6 million last year in property taxes.
Fulltime employment stands at 8,400 people, and many more are employed on a per-diem basis. Permanent employment is expected to grow by 450 after the new studios are built.
BY contrast, NBC has 1.25 million square feet in the G.E. Building at Rockefeller Center for corporate headquarters, studios and a local TV station, leased till 2022 after a major tax abatement from New York City. It also has two studios on Avenue M in Brooklyn, but the bulk of its studio space is in Burbank, Calif.
Similarly, at CBS most of the major studio operations are in California, although the company has one million square feet at its broadcast center at 524 West 57th Street and 800,000 square feet in its corporate headquarters at 51 West 52d Street. Game shows, once shot in New York, are in California. "New York is a tough place to find studio space," said Kent Cooper, director of facilities.
As for housing, the near-term prospects for construction are greatest at Manhattan West. The State Legislature in the current session approved legislation permitting 20 years of Section 421a tax abatement in developments planned, like Manhattan West, with a 20 percent lower-income component. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo signed the bill last week.
The legislation makes the project feasible, according to Daniel Brodsky, president of the Brodsky Organization. The apartments will get 10 years of full tax abatement -- paying only the taxes attributable to the land value -- and the taxes will phase in over the next 10 years. Rents go up to cover these taxes, but the 10 years of full abatement make the units more affordable, and hence more easily rented and more easily financed. The market-rate units are expected to rent initially for about $29 a square foot a year. That works out to about $1,300 a month for a one-bedroom apartment and $2,200 for a two-bedroom, Mr. Brodksy said.
MORE distant is the prospect of development at Donald J. Trump's proposed Riverside South, potentially 5,700 apartments, a film production studio, offices and a park on 57 acres running from 59th Street to 72d Street near the Hudson River to the west of the two other smaller projects. A public review process is under way. Full development would take many years.
One question raised by the Capital Cities/ABC plan is whether new housing would be marketable in the location at the prices developers would need to charge. Some say that if they have paid as much as $50 per developable square foot for the land, a conventionally financed project would not be rentable even with Section 421a subsidies currently available. And in the middle 80's developers paid that much and more.
"With long-term tax-exempt rates in the low 6- to 6 1/2-percent range and with the new 421a program you can start developing rental housing," Mr. Brodsky, the Manhattan West developer, said.
According to Abram Barkan, head of the appraisal and consulting division of Douglas Elliman-Gibbons & Ives, the $115 million price paid by the Trump Organization seven years ago to buy the property for Riverside South will "play havoc with required rental rates when, if ever, anything is built."
Richard A. Kahan, chairman of the Riverside South Planning Corporation, said that the land costs embedded in the project, more than half of them attributable to streets, utilities and parks that the developer must build, are "significantly more" than $50 per buildable square foot.
Nevertheless, "Given a reasonable New York economy, it will be feasible, marginally, as a market-rate project," he said.

HEADLINE: New Haven Rallies for a Tennis Week

BYLINE: By JACK CAVANAUGH

 BODY:
WHEN Jim Westhall moved the Volvo International Tennis Tournament from Stratton Mountain, Vt., to New Haven two years ago, there were doubters galore.
And no wonder. Since 1970 the tournament was held in such bucolic resort settings as Bretton Woods and North Conway in New Hampshire and at Stratton Mountain. For all its educational, cultural and entertainment amenities, New Haven has never been mistaken for a vacation retreat. 
 But in its first two years in New Haven the tournament has been a success, attracting 265,000 spectators to the first major tennis tournament ever staged in Connecticut. And the largest overall attendance yet is expected for this year's weeklong tournament, which begins tomorrow.
"At the rate tickets are selling, we're projecting a 50 percent increase in sales over last year," Mr. Westhall said. That would result in near-capacity crowds at the year-old 15,000-seat stadium and the field courts at the Connecticut Tennis Center, which is near the Yale Bowl on Derby Avenue, also Route 34, in New Haven.
 
Stadium Blocked at Stratton
 This year's field is the strongest ever. The 56 players, competing for $1 million in prize money, is expected to include the Wimbledon champion Andre Agassi, the United States Open champion Stefan Edberg, Petr Korda, the defending Volvo champion; Ivan Lendl, John McEnroe and Goran Ivanisevic, who lost to Agassi in the Wimbledon final. Day and evening sessions, starting at 11 A.M. and 7 P.M., will be held tomorrow through Friday. Saturday's semifinals will start at 11 A.M.; the final will be played at noon next Sunday. The winner will receive $144,000.
That is a far cry from the $5,000 purse offered at the first event held at the Mount Washington Hotel in Bretton Woods in 1970. From Bretton Woods, where it was held for five years, the tournament moved to North Conway, Vt., and 10 years later to Stratton Mountain.
Mr. Westhall, who has been involved with the tournament from the beginning -- when he was an executive with the corporation that owned the Mount Washington Hotel -- was forced to find a new site when environmentalists blocked the building of a larger stadium near Stratton Mountain.
 
Connecticut Rallies Behind Project
 To a large extent, the decision to move to New Haven was based on a pledge by the Connecticut State Legislature to pay $15 million for the construction of the tennis stadium, which is exceeded in capacity in the United States by only the Louis Armstrong Stadium at the National Tennis Center, the site of the United States Open. The legislature also approved the sale of $3 million in bonds for the construction of 22 tennis courts by the new stadium, which are used by Yale University where the stadium and the courts were built.
Besides offering state residents a world-class sports event, the Volvo tournament was seen by many as a boon to the economy of the New Haven area. Indeed, Paul Johnson, who is president of the Tennis Foundation of Connecticut, Inc., an organization of civic and business leaders that owns and operates the tennis stadium, predicted that the tournament would result in "spectacular benefits to New Haven and the State of Connecticut."
An economic impact study of last year's, prepared by the Yale School of Organization and Management, said the event resulted in a direct economic impact of more than $7 million. Of that, $6 million was spent for tickets, wages, parking and concessions at the Connecticut Tennis Center. Off-site expenditures, most of which were in the New Haven area, totaled about $1 million.
 
Expanding the Market
 Most civic and business leaders interviewed said they felt that the tournament has been beneficial to New Haven, both economically and in helping to enhance the city's image, which has been hurt by a number of drug-related shootings. "We're more than satisfied with the results so far," said Matthew Nemerson, the president of the Greater New Haven Chamber of Commerce. "It takes a while before a city can capitalize on a major sports event. A one-week tennis tournament is not going to make or break a hotel, restaurant or anything else. But there can be a spillover that can help create an awareness about New Haven and about all the city has to offer."
Mr. Westhall has put a heavy marketing and advertising focus on Farfield, Hartford and Westchester Counties. "We want to broaden our attendance base beyond the New Haven area," he said.
In persuading the state to pay for the stadium, Mr. Westhall and many of those who helped draw the tournament to New Haven had said the stadium could serve as a site for outdoor concerts. But only one non-tennis event has been held there, a concert by the folk trio Crosby, Stills and Nash, which attracted about 6,000 people in June.
"We hope to have as many as four or five concerts at the stadium next year," said John DeStefano Jr., the executive director of the Tennis Foundation. "In addition, we have made a bid for Davis Cup tennis in 1993, and also hope to stage a women's tennis exhibition." This year, for the first time, the stadium was the site last week of the Pilot Pen Open tennis tournament, an event that features promising young players.
There is no guarantee that the Volvo International -- at times referred to in tennis circles as the "Vagabond Volvo" -- will remain in New Haven. As of now the Swedish car maker is only committed to hold the tournament at the Connecticut Tennis Center this year and in 1993. Volvo officials have said that continued sponsorship depends largely on whether the promoters can continue to attract top players and national television exposure. Part of this year's event will be televised by ESPN, the all-sports cable network, which is based in Bristol.
 
What About the Poor?
 While there has been virtually no opposition to the tournament, others ask why needed, and promised, housing projects in New Haven are not planned and built as fast as the tennis stadium. "The tennis stadium was built with lightning speed, which is both impressive and indicative of what can be accomplished, depending on who is going to benefit," said Jon Alander, the State Commissioner of Human Resources and the former executive director of the New Haven Legal Assistance Association Inc. "Projects built to benefit the affluent are accomplished in record time, but projects for the poor are delayed or never get off the drawing board."
"I'm not opposed to the Volvo tournament, or to the building of the stadium," said Mr. Alander, who lives in Hamden. "But if there's a will behind an effort to build a tennis stadium in such quick time, why can't there be a similar will to build needed housing for poor people in New Haven? For years people who were displaced from their homes in the Dixwell Avenue area, which were then torn down, were promised that the Elm Haven Housing Project would be built in the area. But it still hasn't been done, and God knows when it will.
"I'd like to see the same vigor and energy that was put into the construction of the tennis stadium applied towards housing for the poor. But, when you don't have clout, you always get a lot of excuses."

BLOCKWATCH TOUR
 It is not a conventional house tour being offered this afternoon in New Haven from 1 to 5 P.M. Organized by Blockwatch 320, a group of property owners in the Park-Howe-Dwight Streets neighborhood bordering Yale, the self-guided walking tour covers 20 private residences built in the 19th century that until recently were threatened with extinction. 
 Ten years ago, when Blockwatch 320 was formed, the 12-block neighborhood was losing a battle with absentee landlords and drug traffickers.
Today, "work still needs to be done," said a lawyer, Diana L. Mercer, who lives in one of the homes, "but we no longer have hundreds of prostitutes working Howe Street, and there is no longer a panic-stricken, crime-fighting mentality among the residents."
Ms. Mercer bought her house two years ago, and like many other professionals, businesspeople, Yale faculty members and working-class residents, has invested time and money in restoring and improving her property.
Several of the homes are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and the architectural styles are a living textbook of American architecture. Victorian Gothic, Greek Revival and Queen Anne homesteads stand cheek by jowl with brick row houses, undisturbed since they were built in the 1870's.
But improvement has been stalled by the economy. "Suburbanites bought houses and rented them out, paying no attention to the property," Ms. Mercer said. "Many of them over-leveraged themselves, properties were taken over by banks, or reverted back to drug gangs, some were burned out."
A tour of the homes last year produced heightened interest and some funds for neighborhood programs. This year's tour tickets and maps cost $6 and may be obtained at The Inn at Chapel West, 1201 Chapel Street. For more information, 787-3638.
 
HELLCAT'S NEW LANDING
 A Grumman F6F Hellcat, under restoration for 18 years, is on permament loan to the New England Air Museum from the Navy and may be seen daily from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Twenty-four examples of the aircraft exist today, compared with the more than 12,000 that were built and served in World War II. The aircraft was credited with turning the tide of the war in the Pacific, and the one at the Air Museum is the only example in New England.
Visitors to the museum may also tour the display of about 80 fighters, bombers, helicopters and racers from the turn of the century to the present. And from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. today hundreds of antique cars from the 1930's through the 60's will be on view in a one-day exhibition, as well as auto parts, memorabilia and literature supplied by dozens of swap-meet vendors.
The museum is off Route 75 next to Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, and admission is $5.50, $2 for children ages 6 to 11. Information: 623-3305.
 
CATS ON PARADE
 Representatives of most of the 37 different breeds of cats recognized by the International Cat Association will be judged in the cat show scheduled at Connecticut College in New London Saturday and Sunday. Dramaticats, an affiliate of the International Cat Association, is sponsoring the show. Entries will include four Siberian kittens from Germany as well as Bengal, Egyptian Mau, sphynx, Norwegian forest cat, Occicat, Japanese Bobtail and Oriental Shorthair.
In addition to the purebreds there will be judging of house cats, and the Noank Veterinary Hospital will have cats available for adoption. An array of vendors with cat supplies, climbing trees, cat-motif items and other feline paraphernalia will be on hand, and profits from the show will be donated to research and the welfare of cats.
Show hours are 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. Saturday and 9 A.M. to 4 P.M. Sunday in the college's Dayton Arena, off Route 32. Admission is $4, $3 for elderly people and children. For more information, call 535-2917 or 399-6884.
 
CROSS-CULTURAL 'ROMEO'
 Students from Moscow and Darien have combined to produce a dance program of "Romeo and Juliet" by the Moscow Class-Center of Music and Dramatic Art, to be performed Friday and Saturday in the Darien High School auditorium.
Two years ago the Moscow group and Darien High School Theater 308 met at the Samantha Smith World Peace Camp in Poland Spring, Me., where they co-produced a play. They kept in touch, and in January of this year arrangements were made for the Russian students to spend two weeks at the Maine camp, followed by the current visit with their Darien friends for their presentation of "Romeo and Juliet."
Students and parents involved in Theater 308 spent months raising the money for the Russians' trip through various events.
Performances are scheduled at 8 P.M. Friday and Saturday, with tickets priced at $10, $6 for students and elderly people. Those who wish to attend a reception on Saturday as well as the performance may become sponsors at $20, patrons at $40, and angels at $100 or more. Call 655-0544 for reservations or more information.
 
SHUBERT OPEN HOUSE
 The Shubert Performing Arts Center in New Haven will stage its annual open house on Saturday from 11 A.M. to 4 P.M., free of charge. More than 6,000 people took advantage last year of the day of music, dancing, comedy, juggling and storytelling, offered by the theater company.
Children will have their own mezzanine loft where a program of interactive theater and storytelling is scheduled. Visitors will also be guided through the theater's backstage area and dressing rooms.
Refreshments and prizes will be distributed all day, and a long list of on-stage entertainers, including the Shubert Opera Ensemble and Kindercorp, the Connecticut Gay Men's Chorus, the Stony Creek Improv Theater, the Elm City Cloggers, Amazing Andy the Magician, folk and blues singers and ventriloquists. The theater is at 247 College Street and more information may be obtained by calling 624-1825.

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: Rejuvenating Bridgeport;
A Fully Leased Renovation

 BODY:
Long mired in a seemingly hopeless economic morass, Bridgeport, the largest city in Connecticut, is taking a major step toward rejuvenation with the renovation of the vacant former People's Bank headquarters in the downtown business district.
Mayor Joseph P. Ganim unveiled a rendering of the project this month at the start of renovations for the 11-story, 113,000-square-foot building, which is already fully leased. Among the tenants are an accounting firm, a law firm and the Southern Connecticut Gas Company. 
 Another tenant will be People's Bank, now based across the street in the Bridgeport Center. It will move some of its offices elsewhere into 12,000 square feet.
The bank is paying $4 million to renovate the building, which will be ready for occupancy on Dec. 1. The work includes a new polished granite exterior that architecturally complements the Bridgeport Center. The architect is Fletcher Thompson of Bridgeport.
The new offices will accommodate 300 jobs that would have left Bridgeport. About 50 new jobs will also be created by companies in the building.
"We welcome this new activity in the downtown area and appreciate the committed effort of People's Bank to create jobs, tax revenues and a stronger business community," Mr. Ganim said. "For those who live and work here, the beginning of a revitalized Bridgeport is now real."

HEADLINE: History Through War Collectibles

BYLINE: By ALBERT J. PARISI

DATELINE: PARAMUS

 BODY:
ON the third Monday of every month, the Veterans of Foreign Wars post here is transformed from a sleepy little gathering hall into a living history lesson, with its instructors as diverse and colorful as the long-ago campaigns to which they are attracted.
The participants, armed with boxes of artifacts like a Civil War cap and a thermos bottle from a B-17 bomber, fill the folding tables with military items that for some collectors represent a lifetime of hunting, scouring and searching to piece together moments of history from the Revolutionary War to the Persian Gulf. 
 The gathering of the Eastern Militaria Collectors Association has only the dedicated history buff in mind. And with observances of the 50th anniversary of World War II, military collectibles have taken on the same importance and value as dealing in rare coins and stamps, hobbyists say.
 
'Each One Has a Story'
 Thomas Flurchick of Waldwick, who, 21 years ago, founded the Paramus-based collectors' association, said: "When we were kids, we read about battles in American history class or saw newsreels and it meant little; its impact was just words on paper. But to see such items, to hold them in your hands and study them and know that each one has a story to tell, a deed to be remembered, that makes history a living concept instead of a boring lecture."
Mr. Flurchick, 50 years old, is a video production director.
The value of military collectibles has risen sharply. Depending upon the item and its historical significance, what was bought at garage or estate sales for next to nothing, Mr. Flurchick said, now has a value of hundreds or even thousands of dollars.
Because of this, and especially in terms of foreign service medals, forgeries are common, and a keen eye must be developed to tell the authentic from the fake. Copying American medals is akin to counterfeiting United States currency and carries similar penalties, Mr. Flurchick said.
It is not uncommon for a collector's table to display a weathered Union Army officer's cavalry sword along with an Iraqi helmet complete with camouflage netting. Before long, collectors and visitors can find themselves exchanging tales of Shiloh, Pickett's Charge, Midway and Basra.
 
Swapping as Well as Selling
 As much swapping as selling takes place at the gathering. For Severino Mendez of Flushing, Queens, the curator of the Sea-Air-Space Museum aboard the decommissioned aircraft carrier Intrepid, the gathering is a chance to upgrade and enhance displays at the museum.
"When people walk through the Intrepid and see all the items on display, one of the first questions we get is, 'Where do you find stuff like this?' " Mr. Mendez said. "The answer is groups such as this, and it's always been a wonderful source of history for myself and the museum."
For Thomas J. McGurr, 61, of Teaneck, a Navy veteran and electrical contractor, a meeting is a welcome chance to "get out of my wife's hair for the night," he said, and swap service stories with other veterans. But, more importantly, it is a hedge against what is for him a failing economy. In recent years, Mr. McGurr's contracting business has suffered, he said, and has forced him to lay off a number of employees.
Mr. McGurr, a collector of memorabilia for some 40 years, said he had been forced to sell off a good part of his collection, particularly a vast assortment of stylized ivory-handled pocket knives from ports around the world that he purchased when he was in the merchant marine. "It helps to make ends meet," he said.
 
'Interesting Characters'
 Mr. McGurr and other collectors say the meetings draw "some interesting characters."
"There was this one guy who used to come here, a Navy vet like myself," Mr. McGurr said, "and every time I saw him, we got to talking about the old days; his rank would change. First time I met him, he was a seaman. The next time he was a higher grade, and a higher one after that.
"Finally it got to the point where whenever I saw him, I'd just call him Admiral and leave it at that. I guess he was lonely and just needed someone to talk to. Maybe his kids and grandkids had heard the stories one too many times."
For Ron Foreso, 40, of Stanhope, the living history lesson is something he takes back and incorporates in lesson plans for his students. A teacher of American history at Parsippany High School, he also teaches an elective course on American military history.
"When we talk about the Civil War in class, it's tough for kids today to have a concept of what took place back then and why," Mr. Foreso said. "But when we talk about the stifling summers when troops marched hundreds of miles to do battle, bringing in a heavy woolen coat from the era, or a sword, brings it home to them in a way like no other."
 
Students Dressed in Uniforms
 He mentioned a recent school program observing the 50th anniversary of World War II in which big-band songs played by student musicians were enhanced by a number of his students dressed in period service uniforms from his collection.
"There were about 200 older veterans in the audience, and when the theme song to each of the services was played, like the Marine Corps anthem, the veterans in that service would stand, and so would the students dressed in that uniform," Mr. Foreso said.
"Well, before you knew it, the kids' eyes would fill with tears, the veterans' eyes would well up and generations were brought together in a moment without a need for words."
Mr. Flurchick said: "What we do here does not glorify war, past or present, nor do we want to give the impression that we condone it, but how many thousands of men and women died for their country or came back maimed in service to it and still went on with their lives? That's what we're trying to remember here. That kind of sacrifice, no matter how great or small, must live on, and in a way, we're its caretakers."

HEADLINE: County Fights Plan on Power For Con Ed

BYLINE: By TESSA MELVIN

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
WESTCHESTER officials went to Albany last week to argue against building a transmission line that the county says would bring Con Edison consumers electricity they do not need and cost $1 billion more over five years than the consumers should pay.
Westchester customers would absorb $150 million of that figure, according to the county, which estimates the average county homeowner would pay $35 more a year. The remaining $850 million would be paid by consumers in New York City, the county says. 
 At issue is a contract Con Edison officials say they were forced to sign with a developer planning a massive generating plant in upstate Oswego County. The 1,000-megawatt natural gas-fired plant, the second largest in the country, will "co-generate" two kinds of energy -- electricity for Con Edison and steam for an adjacent industrial plant in the town of Scriba.
But the developer, Sithe Energies, says its Independence Project, as the Oswego plant is known, will provide significant economic and environmental benefits to downstate consumers. Opponents of the project, the developer says, have grossly exaggerated its costs to ratepayers out of fear of the competition an independent producer provides. Sithe estimates that the average homeowner in Westchester would pay $12 more a year for electricity.
The Westchester County Attorney's Office, with the unanimous support of the County Board of Legislators, joined representatives of the New York Power Authority last week to oppose the project at hearings conducted by the Public Service Commission in Albany. The commission's approval is needed to build a transmission line.
Lawyers for the county argued that Con Edison's aggressive conservation measures have reduced demand significantly and that the utility's power reserves exceed the requirements of the New York Power Pool.
The county's major argument, however, is that the contract forces Con Edison to buy energy at prices "more than twice the expected cost of energy from alternative sources," said Michael J. McDermott, the assistant county attorney, who called this a result "of a process gone awry."
 
State Regulations Are Blamed
 Mr. McDermott said the problem stems from regulations put forth by the State Public Service Commission, which regulates utilities in the state and requires Con Edison to purchase energy according to a price schedule the commission develops, as outlined in a 14-year-old Federal energy policy.
Parties in this dispute disagree about the specifics, but all agree that there have been many changes in the years since the adoption of this Federal policy, created to alleviate an energy crisis. In 1972 fuel prices were high and supplies in doubt and so the policy led to a law to stimulate independent fuel production and encourage fuel efficiency. Since then, world market prices have plummeted and supplies are now abundant. But the number of independent fuel producers is growing, under a law guaranteeing them a minimum price for their product. They are building power plants that they say are cleaner and more efficient than those owned by utilities, the majority.
The minimum-price law, the Public Utilities Regulatory Policy Act of 1978, provided that co-generators of "clean" energy would be guaranteed a market, by requiring utilities to purchase the power these plants produced at rates established by state regulatory agencies. Purchasing such co-generated power, according to the Federal law, is not supposed to cost consumers more than the alternatives.
In New York State, the Public Service Commission periodically predicts the costs of energy by evaluating changes in world supplies and conditions. The commission sets rates based on the costs it decides utilities will not incur by having to produce the energy themselves. "Long Range Avoided Cost" estimates are used by the independent producers as the basis for their contracts with the utilities.
 
Rates Revised 4 Months Later
 The Sithe contract with Con Edison was signed in May last year, after negotiations that were described by the Manhattan-based developer as cordial and that Con Edison officials said Federal and state laws "required" them to participate in.
The contract was based on rates that were set by the commission in 1990. But these rates were revised by the Commission staff four months after the contract was signed, in the wake of dramatically reduced prices and increased supplies.
"The 1990 Long-Range Avoided costs overstate the value of a kilowatt hour by more than double," Mr. McDermott argued in his statement to the Public Service Commission last week, pointing to what he said are "huge cost consequences for Con Edison's electrical customers," amounting to more than $1 billion.
"If Sithe had negotiated a contract based on flucutating fuel costs, that would be fine," said Edward M. Gibbs, administrator of the Westchester County Public Utility Agency, an organization established a decade ago to provide sources of low-cost power for Westchester customers.
 
Intervention Requested
 Calling the company's decision to use a fixed rate "an aberration," Mr. Gibbs said the Public Service Commission must intervene. The expected rate increase, he said, is "unconscionable."
"This is the coup de grace for Westchester rate payers," Mr. Gibbs added.
Last week, a spokeman for the Public Service Commission said the agency cannot intervene in contract disputes. Although Con Edison is required to contract with independent power producers for their energy, Edward C. Collins, the spokesman, said, "It was not necessary to sign the one they did. They could have tried to negotiate."
Harold E. Vogt, executive vice president of the County Chamber of Commerce, has also blamed Public Service Commission regulations "for entitling the developer to prices based on outdated utility-cost projections."
In his reply last week, Peter A. Bradford, chairman of the commission, observed: "Con Edison was not forced to sign the contract. Indeed, if they believed that the price for this power was too high, they should not have signed."
 
Why Sithe Chose Con Ed
 The storm of recent opposition to a contract negotiated over a two-year period has surprised representatives of Sithe Energies. The suggestion of a $1 billion "overrun" he said is "an attractive sound bite that is just false," said Bruce J. Wrobel, executive vice president of Sithe Energies.
The new plant is "the most efficient and cleanest" ever proposed in the nation, he said, and downstate customers of Con Edison will receive an estimated $1.6 billion in environmental benefits, such as reductions in the cost of running the emission control systems needed for older plants.
The company chose Con Edison to receive its energy, Mr. Wrobel said, because it is the utility in the state "most in need of new capacity" produced by modern, environmentally safe plants.
"Con Ed has the most oil-fired generation," Mr. Wrobel said. "So the environmental benefits of our plant will be maximized."
 
Benefits for Oswego
 Oswego County has issued a $750 million industrial-development bond to finance the plant in Scriba. Kathryn E. Torba, executive assistant to Mayor Terrence M. Hammill of the city of Oswego, said local residents strongly support a plant that could bring $48 million in yearly earnings and provide 1,300 construction jobs during the two years it would take to build.
Acknowledging downstate concerns, Mrs. Torba said: "Obviously, they have a legitimate right to be concerned, but we're not sure their utility bills will go up. Many plants around the state are getting older and will neeed to be replaced. We're not sure our breathren downstate will be affected."
In Westchester, Mr. Gibbs strongly disagreed. "We support co-generation, and we're certainly in favor of jobs," he said. "But not on the backs of our rate payers."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
A Decade Later, Mexico Is Loved By Investors

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
Happy birthday to a great bull market.
There were no parties to mark the occasion, but the great 1980's bull market turned 10 last week. As it happened, it was Mexico, and the threat it posed, that was scaring many in this country both when that decade began and when it ended. 
 The fear in 1982 was easier to understand. It was on Aug. 12, 1982, that the right of foreigners to withdraw dollar deposits from Mexican banks was suspended. Only devalued pesos were available. The international debt crisis had begun.
Bull markets, the Wall Street cliche says, climb a wall of worry. Never was that truer than a decade ago. Amid a severe recession and talk of financial collapse, the United States stock market hit bottom that very day, and began a rise that, by now, has caused the average stock to more than quadruple.
Just 10 years later, on Aug. 12, 1992, the deal known as Nafta -- North American Free Trade Agreement -- was signed by the Governments of Mexico, Canada and the United States. While there are enough exceptions to make "free trade" an overstatement, the agreement, if ratified, will be a step in that direction.
Anyone who has not focused on Mexico in the last few years must be surprised by the tenor of the current debate. A decade ago, the talk was of a collapsing economy that could not pay its bills and would drag the international economy down with it. Now, to hear some union officials tell it, Mexico is an economic threat that is all but certain to steal every manufacturing job left in the United States economy.
In fact, Mexico has plenty of its own problems, including a shortage of skilled labor, but the financial community is nonetheless in love with it, for the simple reason that the Mexican stock market has been a phenomenal performer. The Financial Times/Actuaries index of Mexican stocks, in dollars, is now more than 70 times higher than it was at the end of August 1982.
It took North American investors a while to warm to the idea of Mexican equities, but by early this year their money was pouring in. The timing was unfortunate. From a peak in March, Mexican stocks fell 27 percent to a low in late July, and have done little since. The signing of the free-trade deal last week caused barely a ripple.
Nonetheless, investment interest remains high. Dividend yields are minuscule -- about 1.3 percent -- but the belief in continued rapid growth is high, and the companies are not trading at huge multiples of forecasted earnings. Luis R. Luis, who watches Mexico for Scudder, Stevens & Clark, a mutual fund group, argues that low dividends are good, because the companies have excellent ways to reinvest their capital.
A decade ago, American stocks traded at low multiples of book value, and were shunned. And everyone knew Mexico was a horrible place to put money. Now, the reverse is true on both counts. Perhaps, just perhaps, the conventional wisdom will, once again, be disappointed.

THE ECONOMY
 
The Mexico Question 

For President Bush and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada, the tough job now is getting their governments to approve the free-trade pact they negotiated with Mexico. For President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico, the job will be easier: "It will be passed immediately," said Rogelio Ramirez de la O, president of Ecanal, an economic consulting firm in Mexico City. The problem in the North is that labor groups are worried that Mexico's younger, less expensive work force will siphon away jobs. But Mexican economists are not so sure. "Even if Mexico has relatively low wages, it will take a long time before those wages can be materialized into equivalent productivity," Mr. de la O said. In industries like automobiles, where United States companies already have numerous plants along the border, "Mexican workers receive lower wages," he said, "but they need more supervision."

Getting Drugs to Market
 
Advances in biotechnogy have been a boon to the drug companies and a bane to the Food and Drug Administration. The F.D.A.'s approval pipeline is backed up, causing delays that the drug companies say can cost them $10 million a month per drug. Last week, Congress, the pharmaceutical industry and F.D.A. Commissioner David A. Kessler came up with a novel plan to cut approval time from 20 months to 12 months for regular drugs and bring it down to six months for potentially life-saving medications. To do so, the F.D.A. would hire 600 new examiners and charge the drug companies extra fees to cover them. The plan would turn over $75 million to the F.D.A. over five years.
 
Well, at Least Prices Look Good
 
As the economy's growth rate continues on its bungee jump downward from 1980's highs -- waiting nervously for that upward yank -- slow growth is providing at least one benefit: Prices are barely budging. The Labor Department's Consumer Price Index for July rose by just 0.1 percent, , following a slim 0.3 percent rise the month before.

Productivity on the Rise
 
One way to get productivity gains is to invest like mad in new equipment and training so each worker produces more. That's the Japanese and German way. Another way is to trim the work force while output remains the same; dismissals keep wage demands low. That's the way it's done these days in America. As a result, according to the Labor Department, productivity rose last spring by a strong 2.3 percent. "We have had a full year of markedly lower rises in unit labor costs," said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Company.
 
Politics and the R.T.C.
 
It has been one embarrassment after another for the Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency overseeing the savings and loan bail out. In March, the General Accounting Office told Congress the R.T.C. had lost track of at least $7 billion. Last week, R.T.C. lawyers said politics was getting in the way of business. Jacqueline P. Taylor, one of the lawyers, said the agency dropped a plan to sue officials of an S.&L. after one of the officials visited President Bush. She called it "an inappropriate settlement because of political reasons."

Japan's Comfortable Slump
 
As slumps go, Japan's is the one to have. While the country's stock market may be hitting new lows, growth is still positive, unemployment is below 3 percent and the trade surplus is soaring. Last month, according to the Finance Ministry, Japan's surplus with the rest of the world reached a record $9.24 billion. But while most analysts expected the trade surplus to rise because of the effects of the slump on Japan's demand for imports, that was not the reason the surplus jumped. Exports were up for the 26th month in a row; they grew by 10.8 percent in July. America's appetite for Japanese goods remained insatiable. Its surplus with the United States jumped 27.3 percent to $3.84 billion.

A Pledge for a Guarantee
 
When Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel returned home after visiting President Bush last week, he was not empty handed. Mr. Bush announced he had reached an agreement with Mr. Rabin on the long-delayed $10 billion loan guarantee package Israel had requested. The United States will not be lending Israel the money, only guaranteeing repayment in the event Israel defaults. That will enable Israel to borrow more cheaply in the world's financial markets. The money will be used to construct housing for Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet Union. In return for the guarantee, Israel pledged to curtail building new Jewish settlements on the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip and to reform its sagging economy. The measure is expected to go to Congress for approval around Labor Day. "I can get it through the Senate," said Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont.

Boeing's New Russian Brains
 
The latest company to acquire some of Russia's formidable brain power is the Boeing Company. Last week it signed an agreement with the Aviation Department of Russia's Ministry of Industry to set up a development center in Moscow. The deal will enable Boeing to take advantage of advances made by Soviet engineers during the Cold War. Though behind the West in avionics and engine technology, the former Soviet Union had been a leader in airframe technology and in wind-tunnel testing. The new center will initially employ 30 Russian engineers and scientists. "The technology there is of great value to Boeing and its customers," said Larry Clarkson, a Boeing vice president.

 
 
COMPANIES

 
Arm-Twisting for Chrysler
 
Analysts and car buffs agree that the Chrysler Corporation has a winning line-up in its sleek new LH series of cars. Tell that to the banks. Last week, several banks in the 152-member international consortium that lends to Chrysler refused to renew their loans. Their reluctance may threaten the new $6.8 billion loan package Chrysler is seeking to continue revamping its operations. To get some muscle on its side, Chrysler asked the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, to intervene on its behalf with officials of Germany's central bank and get them to persuade an unidentified German private bank to get back with the program. Without the loans, Chrysler's prospects are bleak. "This is the most critically important issue facing Chrysler at this moment, so the agreement had better get done," said Maryann Keller, an analyst at Furman Selz Inc.

The Big Auction
 
Moving commercial properties the old-fashioned way in this real estate market isn't easy. So last week, Kennedy-Wilson Inc., the big Los Angeles auction house, and Jones Lang Wootton U.S.A., a real estate company, held an auction. They put 67 properties worth an estimated value of $500 million on the block. The properties were varied, everything from a Sausalito bayside restaurant to a Wisconsin resort developed by Playboy's Hugh Hefner. And about half were sold. "The U.S. real estate market is at its most depressed in years," said Bill McMorrow, chairman of Kennedy-Wilson. "It is a major accomplishment." Gone were 34 properties for a total of $178.2 million. Bunker Hill Towers, in downtown Los Angles, had the highest bid: It went for $19.1 million to Hon Kwok Land Investment Company Ltd., of Hong Kong.

To trim costs, the McDonnell Douglas Corporation said last week it would combine its six military divisions into two divisions and sell off its helicopter business.

A Thriller From Washington
 
It was no ordinary case of theft. High-level members of the Justice Department were accused of stealing a software program developed by Inslaw, a California company, and turning it over to business associates who then sold it internationally and pocketed big profits. Last week, the House Judiciary Committee concluded that the charges were true and that Attorneys General Edwin Meese 3d and Dick Thornburgh had blocked Justice Department investigations of the case. Moreover, it recommended appointing an independent prosecutor and looking into the suicide of a journalist who was investigating the case. The evidence "raises serious concerns about the possibility that a high-level conspiracy against Inslaw did exist and that great efforts have been expended by the department to block,' an investigation, said the committee's chairman, Representative Jack Brooks, Democrat of Texas.

Hughes Bucks the Trend
 
While many military contractors scramble to diversify into commercial businesses, the Hughes Aircraft Corporation, a unit of the General Motors Corporation, is sticking with the Pentagon. It made an offer to purchase the division of the General Dynamics Corporation that makes cruise missiles for about $450 million worth of G.M. common stock. Last week the Justice Department said it would not block the sale

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds;
A Safety Net for Money Funds?

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
At the same time that fund executives revel in the industry's prosperity, more and more of them worry about its Achilles' heel: money funds.
The public has basically been using money funds, with share prices fixed at $1, as substitutes for bank accounts. Prospectuses warn investors that share prices can fluctuate, but none has yet. Nevertheless, as the stakes grow higher -- money stashed in money funds totaled a record-breaking $569.7 billion on June 30, according to Lipper Analytical Services -- if a money fund did fall below the $1 share price a crisis of confidence might reverberate through the entire industry. 
 For some, it's just a question of time. "People are worried about money markets breaking the buck, and they're right -- one day they will," said Marianne K. Smythe, director of the division of investment management for the Securities and Exchange Commission. And that has fund leaders pondering ways to head off problems, from insuring accounts to setting up bad debt reserves to establishing capital requirements.
The fragility of money funds' fixed $1 share price surfaces from time to time. In 1989, Integrated Resources defaulted on $23 million of commercial paper held by the Value Line Money Fund. The following year, the Mortgage and Realty Trust, an investment trust that dealt mainly in commercial real estate mortgages, defaulted on its commercial paper, leaving 10 money funds holding $75 million of sharply downgraded paper.
In these cases, the relatively small size of the bailouts allowed the funds to absorb the losses rather than reduce the share price.
That may change. Today the fund industry owns 36 percent of all commercial paper outstanding, a market that has doubled in size since 1984, according to Michael L. Goldstein, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. Commercial paper carries no guarantees and no insurance, and with "funds growing faster than the supply of low-risk commercial paper, eventually a financial accident could occur at a scale beyond that which can be covered by the liquid assets of management companies," he says.
Recent S.E.C. rules that limit a fund's holdings of low-rated commercial paper and force fund managers to scrutinize their credits more carefully may have averted serious problems. "But the sheer scale of the industry, combined with the rapid growth of the commercial paper market and the absence of reserves, ultimately poses a business risk," Mr. Goldstein concludes.
James L. Pierce, an economics professor at the University of California at Berkeley, writes that money funds "present a real, though small, risk to their holders." Even so, he argues in his book "The Future of Banking," money funds are by nature better suited to handle the nation's cash flow than savings accounts, as the savings-and-loan crisis clearly shows.
That is because banks' deposit liabilities are largely backed by illiquid loans, making them vulnerable to runs and liquidity crises. By contrast, money funds back their deposits with highly liquid and relatively safe assets -- a much better match.
He concludes that, with insurance, money funds "could be made safe with little need for additional regulation or supervision."
The concept of a money fund safety net has been tossed around for years. In 1980, as part of his anti-inflation package, President Carter ordered money funds to put 15 percent of all new deposits on reserve with the Federal Reserve, earning no interest. The 34 new funds set up after that ruling yielded about 2.5 percentage points less than existing money funds. The reserve requirement was lifted after about three months, to the relief of fund sponsors, because the Fed feared a recession and wanted to loosen money.
In 1983, Vanguard introduced the Vanguard Money Market Reserves/Insured Portfolio, which bought either insured issues or private insurance for its paper. The insurance drove up the fund's costs; in 1988, its expenses were .79 percent of assets, more than double the expenses of Vanguard's Prime Money Market Reserves. That cut into yield, and investors, given the choice, opted for higher yield. In February 1989, Vanguard termed the experiment a failure and converted the $150 million fund into an all-Treasury money fund, which holds $2.2 billion today.
William E. Donoghue, the money fund guru, scoffs at the idea of insuring money funds. "With proper regulation, you don't need insurance," he said.
Still, worried fund executives are debating proposals to protect the $1 share price, according to Fund Directions, an industry newsletter. They include creating a bad debt reserve, financed by slicing off about 10 basis points of the funds' yield; setting up an industry-wide insurance pool, perhaps through some form of captive insurance company, or requiring a sponsor's capital to equal some minimum percentage of its money fund assets.
Banks pay a premium of about 23 basis points for their deposit insurance, Mr. Goldstein says, which is essentially the historical yield advantage of the average money fund over comparable-term deposits. He concludes: "The challenge for the industry is to set investor expectations about risk at levels that are sustainable."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Rabin Brings a Thaw Because He's Not Shamir

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The scenes from Kennebunkport, Me., almost made you want to rub your eyes in disbelief. Was that President Bush giving a tour of his family's seaside home to the Prime Minister of Israel? Was that Mr. and Mrs. Yitzhak Rabin staying overnight with the Bushes just like other "good friends"? Yes, after almost four years of tension and acrimony the Bush Administration and Israel are having a belated honeymoon.
Democracies have a lot of disadvantages in conducting foreign policy -- domestic constituencies, noisy opinion-makers, multiple power centers -- but the United States-Israel relationship recalls that they also have one big advantage: they can change leaders. They can go to the blackboard, erase what is on it and start over. And to some extent that is what these two long-time allies did last week. But is the rebirth of warmth in their relationship based on a real meeting of the minds between new players, or on political expediency? 
 Undoubtedly, the Rabin-Bush relationship was doomed to succeed in part because both men needed it to work for their own domestic electoral reasons. But there has also been a meeting of minds. Mr. Bush and Mr. Rabin's predecessor, Yitzhak Shamir, loathed and mistrusted one another, making the resolution of the biggest issue between their two countries -- Israel's request for $10 billion in housing loan guarantees to absorb Russian immigrants -- virtually impossible.
Mr. Shamir insisted that he be granted the guarantees without having to freeze Israeli settlement building in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip; Mr. Bush insisted that Mr. Shamir choose between loan guarantees and more settlements. As the former Israeli statesman Abba Eban writes in his forthcoming memoir, the establishment of new settlements in the occupied territories had become the obsession of the Shamir Government. "This aim," writes Mr. Eban, was "held to be more important than the absorption of Russian Jews, than the development of the peace process and the maintenance of a cooperative relationship with the United States. The alleged 'crisis' in U.S.-Israeli relations arose because Shamir required the United States to finance a policy to which American interests have always been unanimously opposed."
Mr. Bush exacerbated the crisis, though, by striking what many American Jews felt was a low blow with his statements of Sept. 12, 1991, that basically implied that there was something disloyal about American supporters of Israel lobbying for the loan guarantees over Mr. Bush's objections.
In any event, the Israeli electorate, when it ousted Mr. Shamir from office, in effect made the choice that Mr. Bush had framed, opting for loan guarantees over more settlements. That was Mr. Rabin's message to the President and Congress this week: Israel has changed "priorities." It will focus on economic development within its pre-1967 boundaries, not on building housing in densely populated Arab areas to satisfy an ideological agenda. Mr. Bush responded by endorsing the loan guarantees, and the biggest thorn in the relationship was removed.
There are others, but at least they can be confronted more amicably. The biggest issue involves the peace talks set to resume on Aug. 24. During the cold war the main issue in the United States-Israel relationship was how Israel could disentangle itself enough from its conflict with the Palestinians to be an effective ally of the United States against the Soviet Union. In the post-cold war Middle East, the biggest threats are radical fundamentalism and missile proliferation, issues American officials believe can be resolved only in peace agreements between not only Israel and the Palestinians, but in agreements that integrate Israel into the wider Arab world.
 
Toughest Issue: Peace Talks
 The door to that wider world is Syria. Whether the Syrians are ready for such a deal is a very open question. But if there is a structural problem between Mr. Rabin and Mr. Bush, it will be Mr. Rabin's desire to focus on granting limited self-rule to the Palestinians, while leaving the explosive issue of Syria until later, and Washington's desire that he offer some of land-for-peace deal with Damascus. The Syrians may be vulnerable to a deal now. The phones don't work there, the roads are in disrepair, the economy is stalled. In many ways, Syria today resembles Rumania or Bulgaria before the fall of their totalitarian regimes.
"In an odd way, the peace process is artificially keeping the Syrian regime alive," argued Stephen P. Cohen, director of the Montreal-based Center for Middle East Peace. "Because of the need to integrate Syria into the Gulf war coalition and the peace process, the full force of the winds of change on the international stage have not hit Syria the way they have hit others. Washington has given the regime there a certain legitimacy, because it is needed for the peace process. This has enabled the Syrians to jump over the barrier from the old world to the new one. But to stay there they eventually have to produce at the peace table."
Will any of this be different if the Democrats win?
"I think Clinton starts with a more positive gut attitude toward Israel than President Bush," said Steven L. Spiegel, an expert on American Presidents and the Middle East, "but I think he would spend less time on the Middle East generally. Baker and Bush cared a lot about the Middle East. It is not that Clinton doesn't, but simply that his focus will be on America. I just don't see him micro-managing Middle East diplomacy. Health care is the sort of issue he will micro-manage, not the Middle East."

Nuclear Power Plants Take Early Retirement

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
IN March, Lehman Brothers, the Wall Street investment house, held a half-day conference titled "Are Older Nuclear Plants Still Economic?" Last week an Oregon utility announced plans to shut a plant that is just 16 years old, the third such retirement announcement this year. Paul C. Parshley, the organizer of the March conference, said that perhaps he had misnamed his event. The question is not whether the older reactors are economically sensible to operate, he said, but whether any are.
When is a reactor old? If Trojan, the Rainier, Ore., plant, is indeed closed in 1996, it would be only halfway through its anticipated 40-year life span. Reactors seem to age on some accelerated calendar. Trojan's steam generator is deteriorating. The part is like a quarterback's worn-out knees: it tends to be the component that forces a decision. Steam generators, which transfer heat energy out of the reactor, are common to one type of plant, but each design has a characteristic weak spot that grows worse with age. 
 The nuclear industry was well on its way to extinction, even before the announcement by Portland General Electric, which owns and operates Trojan. There are few replacements in sight for Trojan and 109 other commercial operating plants.
Throwing in the towel on a plant like Trojan is a painful decision. In the era of "not in my backyard," it means giving up operating permits that will be hard to replace. And running it longer would give more time to accumulate money for tearing it down and disposing of nuclear wastes; so far there is $25 million in the company's piggy bank against a cost it has estimated to be at anywhere from $200 million to nearly $500 million.
But the world has turned nasty for Trojan, in ways the builders never expected. When Trojan entered service, Congress made it illegal to build new gas-fired power plants, because the accepted theory was that North America was running out of gas. Now Canadian gas supplies glut the West Coast, making gas a cheaper power source than a wheezing reactor.
And in the early years of Trojan's life, demand for power was galloping ahead by as much as 7 percent a year. But today, a refrigerator bought at an appliance store in Portland General's service territory uses half the electricity of an average model bought when Trojan was new.
Those factors affect many plants, but not all are threatened. "You're looking at a universe of 110 reactors," said Carl Goldstein, a spokesman for the U.S. Committee for Energy Awareness, the nuclear industry's public relations arm. "It doesn't seem startling to me that you have some defections." Trojan, he said, faced stiffer political opposition than most plants. It survived statewide referendums in 1986 and 1990; another is due this November. It was in a region with so much hydroelectricity that it was not needed year-round, a disadvantage for a capital-intensive technology.
 
Political Challenges
 Some detrimental factors can change, said Mr. Goldstein. The price of gas will rise someday, and the Clean Air Act will make coal, which is the main source of electricity, more expensive.
And some reactors may be able to run much longer. Those that are well-maintained could continue for a long time, said Mr. Parshley, the Lehman Brothers executive who organized the March conference. But their overall durability will only be proven plant by plant. Last year the Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved a procedure for utilities to apply for 20-year extensions to their plants' 40-year licenses. The plant that was widely expected to apply first, however, Yankee Rowe in Rowe, Mass., quit at age 32 earlier this year.
Not every piece of machinery wears out early. "You have children of B-52 pilots flying B-52's now," Mr. Parshley said.
Utilities and regulators are scrutinizing the alternatives to reactors more closely. A company might choose to spend $50 million on subsidies to customers who replace their old, inefficient refrigerators and air conditioners, because that will do more to solve the power problem than spending the money on building, fueling and staffing a new plant. Or the company might find it cheaper to buy power from independent generators. Two days after its Trojan announcement, Portland General Electric said that it would put money in windmills.
 
Brain Drain
 Under a new planning system, the Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation is scheduled to explain this fall to the New York Public Service Commission why operating the Nine Mile Point 1 reactor is more cost-effective than spending the money elsewhere. Commonwealth Edison, which services the Chicago area, has threatened to shut some of its older reactors to save money.
Most companies, however, are reluctant to raise that possibility for fear of destroying morale and setting off a potentially dangerous exodus of trained staff. Scott Denman, a spokesman for the Washington-based Safe Energy Communications Council, predicted that the decision at Trojan would set off a "brain drain."
Mr. Denman and others think more plants will follow Trojan's example. They point to Oyster Creek in Lacey Township, N.J., and Big Rock Point, a tiny plant in Charlevoix, Mich., that opened in 1965, saying they are in a "do not resuscitate" category, unlikely to survive if substantial investment is needed.
Meanwhile, Trojan's status is still not clear. Opponents of the plant have already spent over $1 million promoting a ballot initiative this year to close it, and are not giving up. "If they don't think they can go on," said Lloyd K. Marbet, a leader of the campaign, "why provide them four more years to limp?"

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
The Rich Get Richer, But Never the Same Way Twice

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
IN the late 1970's, during the Carter Presidency, the super-rich commanded a smaller slice of America's wealth than at any time since the 1830's, when Alexis de Tocqueville was struck by "the general equality of condition among the people" in the fledgling democracy.
By the end of the 1980's, soon after Ronald Reagan left the White House, wealth in this country had become more concentrated than at any time since the Roaring Twenties. The share of net worth -- assets minus debts -- held by the top 1 percent of households jumped from below 20 percent in 1979 to more than 36 percent in 1989, acording to a new historical data series compiled by the economic historians Claudia Goldin and Bradford De Long at Harvard University and the economist Edward Wolff at New York University. 
 Counting wealth rather than income is a dauntingly imprecise task even in the computer age. But the numbers are more than educated guesses. The researchers tapped studies of probate records and estate tax filings for the distant past and elaborate Federal Reserve surveys of consumer finances for recent decades.
By the 1990's, billionaires had became far more common, if not exactly commonplace. There were only 21 in 1982 (one for every 11 million Americans). By 1991, despite recession, there were 71 -- one Bill Gates, Sam Walton or Ross Perot for every 3.5 million ordinary folk.
If the pattern suggested by the data is accurate, the wealthy's share of the total wealth expanded as much during the Reagan boom as it did in the 100 years -- roughly 1830 to 1929 -- in which America transformed itself from an egalitarian land of small farmers into the world's reigning industrial power.
 
Three Great Cycles
 "Economists have conjectured that over the process of economic development the distribution of wealth started out more equal, turned less equal and then got more equal again as education became more widespread," said Professor Goldin. "The 1980's contradict that."
As the United States has prospered over the past 200 years, the share of wealth in the hands of truly rich -- families with mountains of assets to back up rivers of income -- has swung both high and low. Three great bursts of accumulation and at least three periods of growing equality stand out.
Each time the forces that led to greater or less concentration were different and at no time did politicians excercise anything like perfect control, notwithstanding redistributionist impulses on the part of the Democrats and Republican eagerness to disclaim all responsibility for growing inequality.
The end of Jeffersonian democracy came slowly. In the beginning, the country consisted mostly of small farmers, each owning a bit of land and different from one another only in ability, skill and luck. Industrialization was initially a slow process -- flour mills, cloth mills, iron smelters -- that served local markets and created local fortunes.
The age of moguls, which began in the late 19th century and culminated in 1929 in a frenzy of euphoria about capitalism's future, saw not just the creation of corporations, huge industries like oil, steel and meat-packing, and the birth of the mass market, but the emergence of a stock exchange that enabled the owners of capital to cash out. The growth of wages, meanwhile, was held down by a tidal wave of immigration.
In some ways, the 1980's resembled the Gilded Age and the era of robber barons. The wealthiest 1 percent reaped more than half of the $2.5 trillion rise in total net worth in the period, according to Professor Wolff, in part by building great empires in media, computers and financial services. The stock and bond markets boomed.
But history had not, in fact, repeated itself. Government had played a much bigger role in enriching the wealthy. The supply side tax cuts slashed the highest tax bracket from 70 percent to 30 percent, the high interest rates that accompanied the budget deficit and the Federal Reserve's determination to restore the value of money all swelled the value of capital.
The biggest difference, it turns out, had more to do with what was happening at the bottom than at the top. While the pay of corporate presidents soared to 160 times that of the average worker, union membership sank, and pay and productivity, which had advanced handily in the early 20th century, stagnated.
 
In 1929, the Leveling Begins
 Home ownership and participation in pension plans -- more great equalizers -- declined. Young families saw debt mount faster than the value of their assets when house prices did not rise, except in a few hotspots like California and New York.
"John D. Rockefeller was a nasty bastard, but he built the oil industry," said Professor deLong. "It's the combination of rapidly rising wealth for the Forbes 400 and slow productivity growth for the average American that's worrisome."
In the 1930's, 1940's and during the balmy postwar years, wealth also got dispersed in very different ways. The great leveling started with the 1929 stock market crash and continued, with pauses, well into the 1970's. Black Monday, bank panics and, most of all, the Great Depression destroyed fortunes. The New Deal took from the monied and gave to the poor and middle class. Washington collected more income and inheritance taxes. More important, the New Deal saved the homes, farms and businesses of millions of ordinary Americans.
Less well known is that World War II squeezed wealth into the hands of the working classes. With millions of men in uniform, wartime labor shortages pushed up wages while price controls held down profits. What is more, the National War Labor Board -- heeding F.D.R.'s directive to raise substandard wages -- tended to approve raises for poorer workers while turning down raises for the better paid. The rich, meantime, had nowhere to invest except in war bonds whose value evaporated when the country inflated its way out of its huge wartime debt.
It was in the mid-1970s, after Vietnam, the oil crisis and a bad recession shattered business confidence, that the wealthy's share hit a low point -- in no small part because of a 1973-1975 stock market collapse that was worse than 1929-1933 when the inflation of the 1970's and the deflation of the 1930's are taken into account.
"Prices doubled, but so did wages and home values," said Professor de Long, "but holders of financial assets got hammered."
In between, the 1950's and 1960's was a golden age. The rich got richer but the middle class did so even faster. The stock market boomed, but so did suburbia. The middle class acquired houses, cars, appliances and college educations as never before.
 
Two Impalas per Garage
 "The wealth of the average American, many the children of successful immigrants, went up a lot," said Professor Goldin. "Instead of no house, people lived in Levittown," added Professor de Long. "Instead of an old '34 Ford, people had two Chevy Impalas. A bunch more people joined pension plans."
Looking ahead, it's not clear whether there are forces now at work that would repeat the American past and spread wealth and income more evenly again. A pickup in productivity growth could boost the wages of lower paid workers and let more join pension plans. On the other hand, the technological revolution could easily keep holding down the pay of the young and less skilled.
But neither the moguls nor the multitudes are acting as if they expect much change. The stock market, a barometer of the hopes of the well-heeled, continues to dance near all-time highs. In stark contrast, consumer confidence, which measures the expectations of wage earners, remains unusually depressed.

HEADLINE: DON'T LOOK BACK;
As Bush Runs Again, History Nips at His Heels

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
LOOKING backward is the last thing President Bush wants to do at the Republican National Convention in Houston this week -- for two reasons. Politically, the clear plan for his campaign is to emphasize the future, to nod to the past only to suggest that the next four years will have domestic success to rival the foreign policy triumphs of the last four.
As James A. Baker 3d, the Secretary of State, proclaimed as he prepared to leave his second Cabinet office for his fourth Bush Presidential campaign, "It's now time to turn to new challenges." He said that from now on "President Bush will target America." 
 Nor would a longer look back, at other campaigns for re-election to the Presidency, do much for the candidate's morale. The depressing message of history is that when Presidents have run to retain the White House in circumstances like Mr. Bush's, they have lost far more often than they have won.
It is deceptive to recall landslide re-elections from Franklin D. Roosevelt's to Ronald Reagan's, and to conclude from them that there is something normal about eight years in the White House, something extraordinary about denying a President a second term. It may be natural enough; most of the losers were not very memorable Presidents. After all, who spends much time thinking about the accomplishments of one-termers like Martin Van Buren, Benjamin Harrison or even William Howard Taft?
In fact, there have been periods when re-election was the norm, and others when it was extraordinary.
In the earliest days of the Republic, five of the first seven Presidents were re-elected, and without much trouble at that. That changed in 1840, when Van Buren, a Democrat, was defeated by William Henry Harrison. Starting in that year, party strengths were closely matched. So, except for the special circumstances of the Civil War, which accounted for two terms each for Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses S. Grant, no one won a second term until 1900.
The 1840 election has some similarities to this year's. It was held in a lingering depression. The Whigs spurned their old contenders like Daniel Webster and Henry Clay and picked a new face. It was the first election dominated by gimmicks, songs and slogans, like "Tippecanoe and Tyler Too," and the meanest slur against the incumbent -- the Whigs chanted "Van, Van, a Used-Up Man" -- is not all that different from some of today's gibes at Mr. Bush.
One mistake the Republicans seem determined not to replicate is the one Van Buren made in looking backward to his patron, Andrew Jackson, and especially to his old issues. Of course, today the Republicans may occasionally raise old issues out of habit. Their party chairman, Richard N. Bond, last week managed to make up for the absence of Soviet Communists from the scene by accusing Bill Clinton of planning to invite Fidel Castro to a state dinner.
It is not easy to red-bait without Reds. One can expect Mr. Baker to change that, fast, and to see that the campaign looks forward, not back. Of course, this century's elections are more prominent in the minds of candidates and their handlers. And re-elections have been frequent. From 1932 to 1974, there was only one President, John F. Kennedy, who did not take the oath of office at least twice.
But the two-term norm may be over. Prof. Joel H. Silbey of Cornell University thinks that is changing again, with one-term Presidents likely except in cases of exceptional personalities, like Reagan's.
It is not just the decline of parties that he sees as responsible, though that matters, but also the gap between hopes and reality: "Nobody can be a hero for very long. Today we have such a negative attitude toward government, contrasted with such high expectations that no one can succeed."
Still, nobody, least of all Mr. Bush, is going to assume that incumbents cannot be re-elected. At worst, they might agree that it will be harder. And there are plenty of past examples to look to. This is the 19th Presidential election of this century, and the 15th in which an incumbent was running. Many of them were elected to new terms easily. William McKinley, Theodore Roosevelt, Calvin Coolidge, F.D.R. (three times), Dwight D. Eisenhower, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard M. Nixon and Mr. Reagan all had little trouble.
But not in their wildest dreams do Republicans think Mr. Bush will have an easy victory. So the other five races may have more parallels to today, for in each case the incumbent faced a tough fight. Mr. Taft lost when the Ross Perot of his day, former President Theodore Roosevelt, ran as a third-party candidate and split the Republican vote in 1912. Woodrow Wilson squeaked through in 1916 as the peace candidate, with the Republicans still embittered and divided.
Harry S. Truman ran the classic comeback in 1948. He campaigned nonstop, attacking Republicans and proposing programs of his own, while the Republicans took victory for granted in 1948. Mr. Bush may follow his example and condemn the "do-nothing 102d Congress," but he cannot count on Mr. Clinton's loafing through October the way Thomas E. Dewey did.
Gerald R. Ford in 1976 and Jimmy Carter in 1980 had both confronted serious intraparty challenges for renomination, both had economic problems to overcome, and each had one more special problem. Mr. Ford had pardoned Mr. Nixon, and Mr. Carter had hostages held in Iran.
 
12 Years and OutThe Rule of Dozens?
 There is not, as Arthur Schlesinger, a professor in the humanities at the City University of New York, pointed out, "any profound pattern in all this." But bad economic times have always mattered, and the veteran of the Kennedy White House added cheerfully, "Carter, Hoover, and, one hopes, Bush were casualties of permitting economic troubles to overwhelm them."
Thomas Cronin, a political scientist at Colorado College, says another influence has been at work in the past, and perhaps again today. Except around the Civil War and the Second World War, a party has held the Presidency for more than 12 years only once, when Republicans occupied the White House from 1896 to 1912.
"This is the end of a 12-year run," he said. These days, how often does a sitcom or a play have a 12-year run?" This long into a party's control, he said, "the energy and the batteries wear down." Talent gets stretched thin, he said, and this Administration seems to have only one "savior figure" in the indispensable Mr. Baker.
Some less metaphorically inclined political scientists have developed complex, deterministic formulas that take a dash of economic statistics, a pinch of poll data from questions about whether the public approves of how a President is doing his job, and some secret ingredients to try to predict results. Then, when the results don't quite match the formula, they may tinker with the formula.
Most political scientists think the economy is often the dominant influence on voting, and not just the public's sense of the current state of the economy -- or Franklin Roosevelt would not have been re-elected in 1936 -- but their sense of whether things were getting better or not.
And, since Presidents are given credit or blame, deserved or not, for how the economy functions, those perceptions weigh heavily in poll answers about how a President is doing his job, a question Gallup started asking in the 1930's. Mr. Bush's rating, at 30 percent in the last New York Times/CBS News Poll, is lower than the lowest election year rating of any President who won re-election. Truman's lowest figure in 1948 was 36 percent, before he began campaigning. Mr. Carter's drooped to 26 percent in August 1980, and Mr. Ford's never got below 45 percent in 1976.
There are even simpler formulas. One was suggested last week by Edward R. Tufte, a professor of statistics and political science at Yale. He has a complicated equation involving approval ratings and per-capita disposable income, and it predicts a Clinton victory this time.
 
An Omen for Clinton?
 So does his Eli Axiom, but it goes further. It predicts not only the result this year but the 1996 outcome, too. The Axiom is historically grounded in both election results and the records of Yale University.
Neither William Howard Taft, class of 1878, nor Gerald Ford, Law School class of 1941, could retain the White House. If Yalies just cannot win a second term, then Mr. Bush, class of 1948, will be defeated this time -- and Mr. Clinton, Law School class of 1973, will lose four years from now.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
The Victim Has a Blue Collar, But Free Trade Has an Alibi

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
To many, the free trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, announced last week by President Bush, carries the weight of inevitability. With Europe being transformed into one great marketplace and Japanese middle managers spending Saturdays learning to speak Thai, the United States can hardly afford to keep a distance from its closest neighbors. And so the President is asking Congress to go along with an accord that would, among other things, virtually eliminate customs duties while opening Mexico to America's muscular financial services industries.
But for all the reassuring econo-babble about reaping the mutual gains from global competition, Americans surely harbor suspicions that what is good for most is not necessarily good for all. And those suspicions focus on the plight of the nation's unskilled workers. 
 Is the movement of goods, capital -- even whole factories -- destroying America's blue-collar middle class? Have free traders made a Faustian bargain, exchanging well-paid manufacturing jobs for a cornucopia of fresher vegetables and cheaper blue jeans?
 
Misplaced Blame
 Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House majority leader and a key player in the battle over the deal with Mexico, fears the worst: "How are Americans to compete with workers making 50 cents an hour?" he asked. And his worries are echoed by Gov. Bill Clinton, who seems inclined to go with the free-trade flow, but vows to invest billions in training and technology to restore American workers' productivity edge.
But economists of diverse political stripes, including many alarmed by the growing wage gap, think opponents of free trade in general and the open border with Mexico in particular have misplaced the blame. They argue that while the explosion in trade and international capital movements is likely contributing to the blue-collar squeeze, other factors -- notably technological change -- have been far more significant.
Most important, perhaps, they see no practical alternative to open trade. "The protectionist cure is no cure at all," said Alan Deardorff of the University of Michigan: "The people you want to help are helped least."
While traditional theory does indeed suggest that open trade must come at the expense of the productive resources that are relatively abundant abroad -- unskilled workers -- those who have looked for evidence have never come up with the smoking gun. In fact, during the two decades of rapid trade growth following World War II the gap between blue- and white-collar wages remained very narrow by historical standards.
Economists still assume that, on balance, open trade destroys more unskilled jobs in the United States than it creates. But most agree with Paul Krugman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that the net effect is close to a wash. "Even factories producing super-computers need janitors," he said.
What, then, does explain the blue-collar plunge of the 1980's? Lawrence Katz of Harvard is not ready to write off foreign trade entirely. Mr. Katz, along with George Borjas at the University of California at San Diego and Richard Freeman of Harvard, blames the import explosion for a fifth of the increasing wage gap between high school and college graduates in the early 1980's.
But Mr. Katz notes that since the mid-1980's, exports have grown far faster than imports. Thus, paradoxically, foreign trade has served as a modest engine of blue-collar employment growth in recent years and has probably slowed the decline in wages. The explanation for the current bleak income prospects of unskilled workers, it seems, lies elsewhere.
In research just published in the American Economic Review, John Bound and George Johnson of the University of Michigan point to technological change, which they believe is largely responsible for replacing unskilled labor with machines and educated minds. And Jagdish Bhagwati of Columbia University offers what he calls the "rolling stone" theory.
 
Rolling Stones, Gathering Zilch
 Mr. Bhagwati notes that blue-collar workers uniquely depend on work experience and seniority to supplement earning power. But he believes that rapid changes in the location and product mix of corporations, along with their increasing reluctance to hang onto employees in hard times, are limiting workers' opportunities.
Rex Hardesty, information director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., takes all this ivory tower theorizing with a grain of salt. "If we were importing academics from Japan instead of autos," he said, "they would think differently about trade."
And Mr. Hardesty does strike a sensitive chord: Even if some workers are gaining from trade, one could hardly blame unions for defending those reduced to slathering special sauce on the sesame seed buns. But here, too, there is less to the protectionist case than meets the eye.
Mr. Deardorff and his Michigan colleague John Haveman compared poverty rates in industries (and nearby communities) that have secured protection with poverty rates elsewhere. And they found that high-wage industries in relatively wealthy places were far more successful in building barriers to imports. Washington, it seems, blesses the children who already have their own.
Workers and their companies represent only one side of the income equation; protection also affects living standards by raising consumer prices. Thus the only way to tell whether protection tilts income toward rich or poor is to account for both.
 
Higher Wages, Steeper Prices
 The classic study in this vein, on the textile and apparel industry, is now five years old. But its author, William Cline of the Institute for International Economics, does not think much has changed.
On the one side, protection raises the wages of the industry's workers, most of whom are relatively poor. On the other, it increases the cost of clothing for all the poor. And it generates profits for company owners.
Mr. Cline found that every income class lost: Much of the benefit from quotas actually went to foreign producers, who reaped a price windfall from the restriction on competition. But some Americans lost more than others: The bottom fifth lost 3.6 percent of their incomes while the top fifth lost just 0.3 percent.
Carla A. Hills, America's chief trade negotiator, says the overall loss from protection is a modest 1 percent of national income. But Ms. Hills's economists estimate that protection lowers the purchasing power of the poorest families by a whopping 23 percent.
Protectionism, in the words of Mr. Katz, "is a loser." What, then, should Washington be doing?
Mr. Bhagwati suggests subsidizing the working poor. But the long-term fix -- the one more likely to win popular favor -- is to add to the skills, and thus the earning power, of workers at the bottom.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Political Memo;
Weary and Feeling the Presidency's Weight

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Aug. 15

 BODY:
His aides see it sometimes around his eyes, an expression of weariness that was not there before.
The Peter Pan President who seemed to grow younger and bouncier during the first years of his Administration has faced health problems and staff problems and political problems, and he has finally felt the weight of the office he once wore so lightly.
 
Gleaming, for a Moment
 When George Bush put his old Texas pal, James A. Baker 3d, in charge of the future this week, he recovered some of his gleam -- at least momentarily. The President laughingly defended himself to his spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, for wearing white socks to a press conference with Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel. He returned to his favorite rituals, poking fun at his straight man, Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser, and trading spicy jokes with Mr. Baker. 
 "Obviously, a burden was lifted," Mr. Scowcroft said. "He seemed more lighthearted."
And yet, when Mr. Bush came into the White House senior staff meeting on Thursday morning to make the announcement that Mr. Baker would again be his political alter ego, he looked more somber than excited.
The 68-year-old politician who hates handlers had stumbled so badly that he had to give himself up to handlers for another major resynthesizing job. George Bush is, in many ways, right back where he was four years ago.
He must give the speech of his life at the Republican convention. He must defend his choice of Dan Quayle as Vice President. He must try to win over suspicious conservatives with the help of a prime-time blessing by Ronald Reagan. He had to plead with Mr. Baker, again, to save his chaotic campaign and now, again, has to put up with headlines that proclaim "Baker to the rescue." And he has to begin explaining all over again who he is, what he stands for, and where he wants to take the country.
Now comes the test: Is the problem that the President has not been getting out an effective message, as Bush loyalists claim? Or is the problem the reality of Mr. Bush's record, as Clinton strategists argue?
The President's new masterminds will try to make the public forget the large chunks of the Bush Presidency that were static, muddled and inconsistent. Instead, they will once again portray Mr. Bush as a man with iron principles, staunch ideology and a coherent framework for governing the country.
Everyone knows it will not be easy.
"George is kind of like Houdini at this point," said the President's brother, Jonathan Bush, an investment banker who has come to the convention as a delegate from New York. "They've shackled him. They've locked the trunk. They've wrapped eight chains around the trunk and you think they have him in there for good. But he'll get out."
Despite Mr. Bush's odd passivity so far this year, his friends cling to their faith that Mr. Bush is at his most dangerous at just such moments, when he is trapped and starts fighting with the ferocity of the timid schoolboy cornered by the class bully.
"George Bush has an internal gyroscope system that has never failed him, at every point when he was underestimated by somebody," said Senator Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming, a Bush confidant. "I would hate to be in the fourth quarter of any contest, in the last hours of the day, if he were behind with a chance to prevail, because he reaches down and pulls up something from down deep in his gut and his eyes sparkle and he gets that smile on his face and here he comes."
After eight years sutured to President Reagan, Mr. Bush wanted to be himself, indulging his butterfly attention span and his patchwork political philosophy. The result was an "in-box" Presidency, taking problems as they came in, offering a series of results rather than a consistent program with a clear philosophy.
 
'It's Crazy Out There'
 Those close to George Bush say that he has felt frustrated, angry and confused at the criticism he has received from all sides in the last few months. If many Americans are befuddled by the President's passivity on the domestic front, Mr. Bush is befuddled by what he sees as the fickleness of the public and the press, and the "screwy climate" in the country.
Jonathan Bush came to the airport to meet his brother when he came to New York recently for a campaign appearance and the President fretted, "It's crazy out there."
Upset by defections in his own party, the former Navy pilot urges audiences to be loyal by using the analogy of his wing man in World War II. Speaking to a group of House Republicans and a group of businessmen in recent private meetings, he said he was tired of Republicans "peeling off," and that this was a time to "stick," not "cut and run."
"When I was down in the water, the wing man was there to protect me, not to do something else," he chastised the Republican lawmakers.
The last year has represented a rejection that is very painful for a man who never took criticism easily and who, despite all his protestations that he pays no attention to polls, loved his high poll numbers.
Six months ago, he began telling friends that the race would be ugly and painful, and that he was not looking forward to it.
"He knew what was coming; he said, 'I'll be ready,' " Senator Simpson recalled. "I said, 'You're going to have to hang by your thumbs for 10 months.' These Democrats want it so bad, they are lusting so bad, their bodies are twitching with wanting the White House."
Republicans close to Mr. Bush, who had begun to despair and panic, were thrilled and relieved in recent weeks to see him turn up the volume.
Representative Jerry Lewis of California, a longtime Bush supporter, recalled a recent meeting with Republican House members at the Capitol where the President waved his arms and pounded the podium so hard that one of his Presidential seal cuff links flew off.
An elated Mr. Lewis picked it up off the floor after the meeting and plans to frame the fragment as a memento of the moment in 1992 when he saw the President engage in the battle.
"He has a strong feeling that if anybody goes from third place to a 30-point lead in one week, as Clinton did, there are anomalies built in there that we don't understand," said Marlin Fitzwater. "It's not real. He doesn't think 40 percent of the population changes its mind in four days."
 
Regretting His Choices
 His closest advisers paint a picture of a President who regrets that, again and again, he went against his own instincts and gave in to the advice of strategists: agreeing to raise taxes as part of the 1990 budget deal; agreeing to do nothing to revive the economy after his advisers told him last year that it would be a shallow recession, succumbing to his political team's panic after the upset of Dick Thornburgh, the Republican candidate who lost to Harris Wofford in the Senate race in Pennsylvania in 1991, and allowing himself to be talked into recasting his trip to Japan in January into a domestic mission in search of "jobs, jobs, jobs."
Part of the problem, the advisers say, is that Mr. Bush is bored by domestic affairs, and had always intended to maintain the status quo on the domestic side, doing only enough to develop a re-election agenda.
"He is less sure of himself on things so complicated as the budget agreement," said one member of Mr. Bush's inner circle.
But while all of Mr. Bush's boosters talk about how he has been ill served with bad advice, their explanations raise the question: Why does he keep people around him long after he has been hurt by their advice, and why can't he simply follow his own best judgment, as he did during the Persian Gulf war? Mr. Bush is the President, after all.
His advisers say that the problem is that Mr. Bush hates dismissing people and hangs on too long, hoping that things will shake out. Long after most of his advisers urged him to replace his obstreperous chief of staff, John H. Sununu, Mr. Bush kept the man who had been instrumental in helping him win the New Hampshire primary.
Once Samuel K. Skinner was in place as chief of staff, Mr. Bush rejected the early bad reviews on Mr. Skinner's performance because he could not believe he would have to get out the ax again so soon. Just so, he has refused to give in to conservative demands that he remove Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and his budget czar, Richard G. Darman -- even though his confidants say he feels that he erred by following their counsel on taxes and the economy.
"He gets weighted down by personnel problems," Mr. Scowcroft said. "If there's anything he hates, it's what he's been doing recently. It just tears him apart to have people he likes fighting with each other and to have staffers he feels he has to change."
 
Battling With His Health
 On top of everything else, those close to the President believe that he has had mood changes as his doctor, Burton Lee, has tried to adjust the dosage on his medication for a thyroid problem.
In the last year, since doctors discovered the thyroid problem, he has complained from time to time that he is tired, which he never did before. And friends and aides have noticed that on occasion he does not have as much energy and that his eyes lose their shine.
Although there has been much speculation that the President was sick or sulking, given his sluggish reaction to months of Democratic and Republican broadsides, those who know him well are not surprised that he only recently seemed to come alive in the race. Mr. Bush firmly believes that no one tunes in to a campaign until the fall.
The late John G. Tower, the Texas lawmaker who watched Mr. Bush from the beginning of his political career, used to explain his friend this way: "George Bush is only good if he can go into the fourth quarter with two minutes left and kick the winning field goal or catch the final pass."
 
Repairing a 'Hideous Mosaic'
 Senior Bush advisers say that they need to do a complete reconstruction of the President's image and the Reagan coalition during next week's convention and the fall campaign so that the Bush agenda is no longer, as one Bush associate calls it, "a hideous mosaic that leaves all constituencies dissatisfied."
"We literally have to do in three and half months what the White House should have done in three and a half years," said one top adviser.
The President's son and political adviser, George W. Bush, said that he and his father believe that Mr. Clinton has too little stature and too much baggage to prevail in the end. "Clinton came out of the gate at 100 miles an hour, but he's got a long way to go and he's out of breath," said the Texas businessman, who has backed his father's stubborn insistence on waiting until the convention to begin fighting back or explaining his agenda for the country.
Echoing his parents' view, the younger Bush complains that Mr. Clinton is being "coddled" by reporters.
Senator Simpson agreed, saying that baby boomer reporters are giving the baby boomer ticket a free ride. "Bill Clinton and Al Gore speak in a kind of code that appeals to people their age, stuff about Elvis and the kind of music they play," he said. "The code is designed to throw off some of the old goats."
And Marlin Fitzwater sat at his desk one day last week comparing news magazine coverage of Mr. Bush and the Democrats and complaining: "The incredible thing is after four years the media is not willing to give the President credit for anything. It's just like it was four years ago."
But Mr. Bush is not panicking about his re-election, those close to him agree. Even through a dark period of calls for abdication from some in his own party, a demoralized staff and chilling poll numbers, the President has remained confident that Americans are "fair," as he puts it, and that they will eventually come back around to his view: that he has been a good President who deserves a second term.
"He has taken all this with relative equanimity in this sense: When the polls were up at 65 and 70 percent he told everybody else and kept telling himself that it isn't going to last," Mr. Scowcroft said.
"When it didn't, I think he was not so crestfallen as he might otherwise have been. But the long honeymoon he got also gave him the feeling that fundamentally the American people responded to him and liked him, therefore his troubles were recoverable."

HEADLINE: At UConn, Costs Squeeze The Students

BYLINE: By ANDREW L. YARROW, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: STORRS, Conn., Aug. 12

 BODY:
The fall semester is more than two weeks away, but Karen Poulin is spending her summer working 48-hour weeks as a clerk at the University of Connecticut Co-op to help pay tuition and other college costs that have more than doubled in just five years.
"I can't make it without working," said the 20-year-old health-education major from Vernon, Conn. "It's costing over $10,000 a year to go here." 
 Ms. Poulin is among thousands of students attending state universities, not only in Connecticut but throughout the Northeast and the nation, who are struggling to pay soaring college costs that are a painfully visible symbol of the financial crisis buffeting American public higher education.
 
Rising Costs, Reduced Services
 Although the roughly $10,000 a year for tuition, room and board and other fees at schools like the University of Connecticut, the State University of New York and Rutgers may be a bargain compared with private colleges charging more than twice as much, to many middle-class and poorer families it seems like a betrayal of the historic premise of state universities as affordable, democratic institutions.
The increases at these once thriving and once inexpensive schools have come in the wake of budget cuts imposed by desperately straitened state governments in the last three or four years, but many students and educators said that now the cumulative impact has become overwhelming.
In addition to increasing tuition, public universities have had to cut faculty and other staff; reduce services; trim enrollment, and eliminate classes and even entire majors and departments. Among students and professors, morale is low, and for administrators, the modus operandi has become one of "ongoing crisis management," said Wilbur Jones, the University of Connecticut's vice president for finance and administration.
 
Bringing It Home
 The effects have been particularly acute for UConn, which has been a haven for students unable to afford or get into Ivy League and other private New England colleges. Perhaps best known for its winning basketball team, the university has long struggled to improve its status as a research university. UConn is also the alma mater for many of Connecticut's state legislators, who have nonetheless had to slash the state's contributions by $47.5 million over the last four years. For this academic year, the state's appropriation was $125.6 million for the university's $320 million budget, a cut of $13.8 million.
As a result, the university has eliminated almost 600 workers -- or 13 percent of its staff -- including about 175 faculty members, through early retirement and layoffs during the last three years, while enrollment at Storrs and at five branch campuses has remained about 24,000. Tuition and fees for state residents have jumped to $3,902, from $2,293, since 1988, while room-and-board costs have escalated to $4,880, from $2,790.
The university also tapped $6.7 million of the $22 million in its financial reserves. "If they're a rainy-day fund," said the university president, Harry J. Hartley, "we've never had a rainier day in my 20 years here." Officials say the hemorrhaging has stopped, and Mr. Hartley persuaded the Legislature this spring to restore $5 million it had cut.
But a 10 percent tuition increase is already planned for next fall, and -- more ominously -- a committee charged with finding up to $23 million in additional savings is to recommend this fall eliminating or consolidating departments or programs.
The squeeze has particularly hit students whose parents earn from about $30,000 to about $70,000 a year. They are generally ineligible for financial aid but still find it hard to afford up to $50,000 for a public education.
 
Not Poor Enough
 "They essentially told me, 'Don't even try for financial aid unless you live in a shack,' " said Ms. Poulin, whose father is an engineering aide at Pratt & Whitney and whose mother is a teacher's aide.
Seeing her brother, like many other students, deeply in debt, she said that in retrospect, "Maybe I should have gone to a community college." To pay for college, she said that many friends have joined the Army or National Guard. And given the bleak prospects for jobs after graduation, she said that if she can afford it, she plans to go to graduate school "to not go out into the business world."
Christine Frydenborg, a 22-year-old who graduated this spring, said, "A lot of students have had to go back to the branches, to save the $5,000 in room and board."
For students, it has not only meant higher costs but classes that are larger and ever more difficult to get into.
"I spent three hours waiting for someone to drop out so I could enroll in an English class," said Jennifer Franchere, a 20-year-old business major. "They canceled half the sections of a Shakespeare class, and, in lecture classes, people are sitting on the floors."
 
The Five-Year Diploma
 This, in turn, has made it harder for students to earn their degrees in four years, as they have been forced to reduce their course loads to work and have had to put off enrolling in perennially filled classes.
"If there are shortages of classes that are either university requirements or requirements for a major, it can force students into a fifth year," said George Ferencz, a fifth-year undergraduate who is editor of the student newspaper here, The Daily Campus. "We're getting every indication that the situation isn't improving and that there will be more cuts. Students are not optimistic."
Neither are faculty members.
Ed Kostiner, chairman of the chemistry department, said his department is "down from 30 to 25 faculty positions, and we're told we can only recruit two people," and recruiting can only begin a year from now. Other ravaged departments, he said, include English, which has lost eight professors, and physics and psychology, which are each down six professors. To cope, departments plan to rely more on part-time instructors.
"The biggest impact is yet to be felt, because the early retirements just came this spring," said Jerome Smith, a professor emeritus of psychology. "When you lose faculty, you lose coverage of some classes. But you also lose scholarly activity, which means a decline in the university's reputation, which is ultimately what a university is."
 
No Comfort Elsewhere
 The problems confronting the University of Connecticut are anything but singular among state schools.
"All public, four-year universities, with some limited exceptions, like Utah and Alaska, are under the worst fiscal stress since the Great Depression," said C. Peter Magrath, the president of the National Association of State Universities and Land Grant Colleges, which includes 150 of the largest public research universities and historically black land-grant colleges.
Indeed, the list of casualties is a veritable roll call of the states, with the worst damage occurring in the last two years: In California, fees for state residents have jumped by more than 60 percent. The hard-hit University of Massachusetts at Amherst, just 60 miles north of Storrs, has sustained cuts in state funds topping 30 percent, and the state universities of Maryland and Virginia have taken hits of 17 percent and 15 percent, respectively, in state aid.
At Ohio State, tuition went up 10 percent this year, and 300 jobs and three academic departments were eliminated. Other tuition increases this year ranged from 16 percent at Florida A & M to 33 percent at Oregon State.
The huge State University of New York system sustained a $60 million budget cut in its $3.5 billion budget this year, forcing about 1,150 jobs to be cut and forcing tuition for state residents to be raised for the fourth time in two years, to $2,650 this fall, from $1,350 in 1990.
In New Jersey, the president of Rutgers, Francis L. Lawrence, grimly told the State Board of Higher Education: "Since 1989, Rutgers has absorbed more than $100 million in annual salary shortfalls and base appropriation cuts. As a result, the university has had to freeze, downgrade, reallocate or eliminate the equivalent of 1,100 positions out of 6,900." Since then, $21 million in cuts for this fall will mean another 132 lost jobs, and a tuition increase for state residents to $3,254 -- nearly one-third more than in 1988.
Particularly troubling is that the proportion of their budgets paid by state governments has been rapidly declining, forcing schools to raise revenues from tuition, fund-raising and private industry.
"A lot of people are enormously concerned we're going to privatize the public sector," Mr. Magrath said.
In California, where the state's share of the university system's budget has tumbled to 30 percent in 1991, from 70 percent in 1980, the president of the system, David P. Gardner, said, "The University of California and California State University can no longer be considered as state-funded institutions, but rather as state-assisted institutions."
The same trends have been at work in the Northeast, where New York State's share of the SUNY budget has tumbled to 41 percent this year, from 60 percent in 1979-80; New Jersey's share of Rutgers's budget has dropped to 42 percent in 1990-91, from 51 percent in 1980-81, and in Connecticut, the state's proportion has fallen to 38 percent in the last four years, from 54.4 percent.
Mr. Hartley recognizes that his university is competing for scarce public dollars that increasingly go to entitlement programs with mandated yearly increases. But he is also quick to point out that Connecticut only spends 6 percent of its budget on higher education -- half the national average for states -- and emphasizes that "the university has a long, albeit not well-publicized, history of contribution to the state's economic progress."
Nonetheless, to compensate for lost state aid, the university has done aggressive fund-raising and is wooing "industrial partners," like United Technologies Corporation, which finances a research program at the university, Mr. Hartley said. It has also, thus far unsuccessfully, tried to develop an industrial park. But an inescapable consequence, he acknowledged, is to "shift the burden from the state to students."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Democrats;
Clinton Campaign to Slow Down During G.O.P. Convention

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PITTSBURG, Calif. Aug. 15

 BODY:
Bill Clinton's frantic pace will slow significantly next week as the Republicans take center stage for their week of self-congratulation. But it is clear that the Republicans began stealing the march on the Democrat last week.
President Bush's campaign commandeered the airwaves and news pages with seemingly contradictory statements on abortion, attacks on Mr. Clinton's wife, Hillary, pronouncements on "sleaze" journalism and, finally, the political reinstatement of James A. Baker 3d. 
 The Democratic challenger had originally planned to mount a vigorous counter-campaign while the Republicans were meeting in Houston, with at least one media-attracting event a day that would draw off some of the attention.
But Mr. Clinton's strategists have now scaled back and plan to spend the bulk of the week in Little Rock. Mr. Clinton is scheduled to return home late tonight, take Sunday off and devote Monday to state government business. The campaign still has tentative plans for a few public events, including an Arkansas birthday party for the Governor and a news conference or two to respond to news from the Republican convention.
But Mr. Clinton is saving his major efforts next week for the day after the convention ends, with addresses scheduled for Friday to the National Association of Black Journalists and the Detroit Economic Club, both in Michigan.
The Vice-Presidential nominee, Senator Al Gore, will then join Mr. Clinton for a two-day bus tour that will stop in Cleveland, Erie, Pa., and Buffalo.
Mr. Clinton has already begun priming his oratorical pump for the Republican attacks he anticipates next week. Tracking his words over several days, it is almost possible to hear his defensive gears grinding into action.
"This crowd in Washington," Mr. Clinton told reporters in Concorde last night, "they believe they own the White House. They don't think the people own it. They think it's theirs. And they've kept it for a generation by dividing the people, by terrifying the people, by convincing the people their opponents are aliens from outer space somewhere. And that's what they're going to do this time. That's all they know how to do."
Mr. Clinton's message is clearly a coordinated one. During the past few days, his top strategists have appeared repeatedly on television shows hammering home the same message, hoping they can raise doubts about the Republican ticket before the red-white-and-blue hoopla begins in Houston on Monday.
"We've handled everything they've thrown at us so far," Mr. Clinton said, with a measure of pride.
But most campaigns would prefer to be hurling rather than receiving. The Clinton forces were filled with glee when Barbara Bush indirectly scolded the Republican national chairman, Richard N. Bond, for criticizing Hillary Clinton, but they were caught off guard by the First Lady's tart dig at Mr. Clinton when she observed that the Democratic nominee "never said he didn't have a fling."
Sometimes, Mr. Clinton's reaction borders on outright irritation, as occurred yesterday when several anti-abortion protesters tried to shout him down at the Stockton, Calif., airport, where he was addressing about 100 people.
"Look at what the Republicans are doing," he said. "These people have come out here to demonstrate against me today. They've got a Republican platform that says they want a constitutional amendment to ban abortion, and then they have the President and the Vice President and the First Lady say they're pro-choice. Which side are they on?"
Still, the Clinton camp seems resigned that it will be on the sidelines for a few days, waiting to see if Mr. Clinton's post-convention public opinion lead will be erased by the Republicans' effort this week.
And, for the moment, Mr. Clinton is trying out his new lines off stage.
"I'm not about to let them do to this campaign what they've been doing for a generation.," he said. "It has hurt America terribly, all their sort of negative personal attacks, their divisive tactics. It's been bad for our country.
"It got them in the White House, but it hurt America," he said.

HEADLINE: JAPAN MINISTERS VISIT WAR SHRINE

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Aug. 15

 BODY:
Defying a recent high court ruling, almost the entire Cabinet observed the anniversary of Japan's surrender in World War II by worshiping today at the Yasukuni shrine, a Shinto institution once regarded as the soul of Japanese militarism.
Government ministers and some Prime Ministers have made sporadic appearances at the Yasukuni shrine, which is dedicated to the souls of Japan's war dead, but the visits this year struck a particularly nationalistic note, coming so close to the court ruling on July 30. The Osaka High Court ruled that Yasuhiro Nakasone's 1985 appearance at the shrine, the first official visit by a postwar Prime Minister, violated the constitutional separation between religion and the state. 
 Apparently in an effort to avoid angering the Chinese and other Asian neighbors, who tend to criticize any signs of militarism in Japan, Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa did not visit the shrine today, the 47th anniversary of Japan's surrender. He was quoted as saying he intended to go soon.
But 15 of the 20 Cabinet members worshiped at the traditional wooden edifice near the Imperial Palace moat in central Tokyo, as scores of old soldiers in uniform and legions of young rightists marched in the searing heat, vowed devotion to the Emperor and, after a moment of silence to pray for the war dead, shouted "Banzai!" to celebrate the Emperor's reign.
 
Big Role in 1930's
 The Shinto shrine has played an important role in Japanese politics. In the 1930's, when militarists rose to power, it became the center of a Government-sanctioned cult that helped instill a fanatical spirit among the military.
A military museum on the grounds of the shrine recalls that spirit vividly, with flags and letters painted in blood and several displays venerating the suicide units that used planes, speed boats and one-man submarines as human bombs throughout the war.
Most of the Cabinet members who visited today followed the traditional practice of declaring their visits private, and thus unofficial, an ambiguous device that has been followed for years to try to avoid criticism. But one, Health and Welfare Minister Tokuo Yamashita, defiantly insisted that his visit was official and that he did not feel bound by the high court ruling. (The Government's official memorial for the 3.1 million Japanese who died in the war was nonreligious and was attended by the Emperor, the Empress and the Prime Minister.)
Jiro Inoue, a lawyer who headed the group that had challenged Mr. Nakasone's appearance in 1985, said: "I am really angry at this behavior. In the United States when there is a difference in constitutional interpretation, the courts have the authority to uphold their decisions. But these visits just ignore what the high court said."
 
Compensation Rejected
 The ruling did not grant the compensation demanded by the citizens' group that filed the suit. But it did suggest in vague language that because the Yasukuni shrine had been such an important religious institution before the war, an official visit there probably violated the separation of religion and the state mandated by the postwar Constitution.
After the war, Shintoism lost its state support and the Yasukuni shrine became a private institution. But rightists, who make up a small yet very influential pressure group, continually urge ministers to make official visits. The governing Liberal Democratic Party often trades a certain number of unofficial visits for right-wing support on other issues.
That appears to have been the case on this occasion. A planned visit to China in October by Emperor Akihito has been bitterly debated. Some rightists oppose the visit out of concern that the Emperor will be forced to apologize for Japan's wartime aggression.
It has been reported that this year's visits to the shrine were part of a deal to win right-wing support for the trip, which the Government supports to strengthen its ties with a country that is rapidly growing in economic importance.
 
Clinging to Old View
 "These visits dignify the idea of dying for the Emperor," Mr. Inoue said.
But it was clear from the throngs who attended today's ceremony at the shrine that at least some still cling to the old view.
"We're proud of what we did in the war, and this is a festive occasion," said Mitsuo Okada, a veteran in his junior naval officer's uniform, alongside four dozen former colleagues happily posing for snapshots.
A plaque in the museum before some mementos of the 6,000 who died in wartime suicide missions captured the feeling. It praised their sacrifice, adding, "This spirit has laid the groundwork for the peace and prosperity of our nation today and in the future."
The plaque was installed in 1985.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Political Memo;
California Budget Fight May Help the Governor

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif., Aug. 15

 BODY:
Were those crocodile tears that Gov. Pete Wilson shed when he begged off "regretfully" from the Republican National Convention in Houston because of intractable budget negotiations in the California Capitol?
And was Mr. Wilson really as impatient for settlement with the legislative leaders as he claimed each day at terse news briefings when he reported a smidgen of progress or none at all while the nation's most populous state lumbered through its seventh week without a spending plan? 
 As the stalemate lengthens and tempers fray here, more and more lawmakers and political analysts are wondering aloud what the Republican Governor might gain from this sluggish process, which has tarnished the state's reputation, cost it millions of dollars in interest and put a financial squeeze on state workers, vendors and health-care providers who are being paid with i.o.u.'s or not at all.
There is widespread agreement here among both allies and opponents of Mr. Wilson that this week's continued impasse was a blessing in disguise for the moderate Republican Governor because it gave him the perfect excuse to skip the Republican convention.
 
Longer Could Be Better
 But an even longer stalemate may serve the Governor's political purposes as well, many Democrats say. Mr. Wilson does not run for re-election until 1994 and thus has lots of time to recover from the embarrassment of this chaotic budget season and his plummeting poll ratings, especially if he wins legislative changes that would make it easier to enact spending plans in 1993 and 1994.
The November election, meanwhile, could be a graveyard for incumbent lawmakers whose constituents have watched the dithering over the budget with dismay. And their sour reaction to democracy in action could improve the prospects of a ballot initiative sponsored by Mr. Wilson that would give the Governor broad budgetary powers, including the ability to dock the pay of lawmakers and declare a fiscal emergency if the budget is not completed on schedule.
By saying thanks but no, thanks, Mr. Wilson enjoyed the compliment of a prime-time speaking invitation but avoided the potential minefields that awaited him in the Astrodome.
 
Avoiding Abortion Collision
 By staying home, the Governor avoided a collision between his support of abortion rights and the hard-line Republican platform that calls for a constitutional amendment banning abortion, missed sharing the podium with a highly unpopular President and also took cover from jibes and queries about the reversal of fortunes in this once blessed and booming state.
Dan Schnur, the Governor's director of communications, acknowledged that the "abortion thing could get sticky," but he otherwise hewed to the line that Mr. Wilson had been eager to attend the convention and might indeed address the delegates on a television linkup from Sacramento.
Others, however, saw Houston as a no-win situation for Mr. Wilson. "It goes beyond the issue of choice," said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political analyst at the Claremont Graduate School. "As bad off as Wilson is, he doesn't need to be joined at the hip with Bush."
And Merv Field, the director of the Field Poll, tried to imagine the speech Mr. Wilson might deliver and could not quite come up with a workable text.
"An upbeat speech would not have washed," Mr. Field said. "He couldn't talk about the national administration, because they're in terrible shape. And the state administration -- there isn't a single problem that has gotten any better and most have gotten worse. This is no loss to him not to have to say, 'I'm the Governor of the great State of California, which in many ways has lost its luster.' "
 
Grudging Admiration
 Assemblyman Richard E. Floyd, a sharp-tongued Democrat from the Los Angeles area, grudgingly admired Mr. Wilson's deft exit from the hornet's nest in Houston and called him the "toughest-brawling politician since Lyndon Baines Johnson."
"Who the hell wants to stand up on public TV with Quayle, Mrs. Quayle, Bush, Mrs. Bush and maybe even Pat Buchanan?" Mr. Floyd asked with a loud guffaw. "He gets to pass up that ugly dance by saying the equivalent of 'I have to take care of my poor ailing mother at home.' Then he keeps the gown in plastic in the closet and can wear it to dance on the graves of the remains of his political party."
Mr. Floyd is one of many lawmakers who see Mr. Wilson's ballot initiative gaining ground "the tougher it gets around here and the more impotent the state government seems."
The same conditions could spell doom for the sitting legislators, most of them Democrats. "The Governor doesn't want to settle it yet," said Assemblyman Lloyd Connelly, a Sacramento Democrat. "He's concluded it's in his best interest to get closer to the election and increase the likelihood the incumbents are removed."
Mr. Connelly said he had seen specific instances in which Mr. Wilson had stalled the process. Twice this week, he said, he was negotiating fine points of compromise with a Republican counterpart in a situation where the two would normally be expected to reach an accord. "He apologized to me and said he was specifically instructed not to reach agreement," Mr. Connelly said. "Ultimately, you can't buy a car from a guy who doesn't want to sell it to you."
Mr. Schnur denied that Mr. Wilson was stalling and said that "no political adviser on earth" would recommend a bogged-down budget as a path to popularity.
But Mr. Schnur noted that the Governor had "unique leverage" to win painful budget changes this year because the lawmakers, in the wake of redistricting, faced hard elections, credible opponents and voters who would ask hard questions about why it had taken so long to get a budget.
 
'We Can Afford to Wait'
 "We want a budget, but we can afford to wait," Mr. Schnur said. "The time pressure is more intense on them because they have to go home and run."
Mr. Wilson's goal seems to be to absorb all the budget pain on this go-round so he can look better in 1993, a strategy that could run aground if the economy does not right itself.
"He's so low in the polls that he can't deteriorate much further," Mr. Connelly said of the Governor, who had a 20 percent approval rating in a recent Field Poll. "The best course is to get it done now in a way that will make the next one look easy so he can redeem himself."
A clear example of that strategy is the education cuts that Mr. Wilson is proposing. He wants local school districts to return to the state $1.1 billion that the districts were paid last year beyond what they were entitled to under Proposition 98, which guarantees 40 percent of the general fund to education. By taking back that $1.1 billion, the Governor not only saves that amount this year but lowers the baseline so school spending climbs less steeply in the future.
That strategy set the state school chief howling. "It all has to do with next year," said Bill Honig, the superintendent of public instruction. "The Governor doesn't want to be at risk, and it's not fair to make the kids pay for that."
A Democratic legislative budget writer said that halting such "pyramiding transactions" was Mr. Wilson's "only chance of not having problems next year." The budget writer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that if Mr. Wilson had fiscal problems again in 1993 he was "dead meat," but that if he sailed through the next budget cycle, voters would flock back to his side.

HEADLINE: Tainted Water Forces Hardship on Pawtucket, R.I.

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: PAWTUCKET, R.I., Aug. 15

 BODY:
For almost two weeks, the taps here have been spewing bacteria-fouled water, forcing residents to buy bottled water or go to fire stations for free water.
State health officials urged residents to boil tap water or use bottled varieties on Aug. 3 after tests disclosed the presence of fecal coliform, or E. coli bacteria, found in human waste. 
 Officials of the Pawtucket Water Supply Board said they believed that the bacteria entered the lines during installation of 13,000 feet of new pipes. The work may have dislodged bacteria-laden sediment from the bottom of the old pipes, some of which were more than 100 years old. The city's water comes from the Scituate Reservoir.
E. coli bacteria can cause diarrhea, nausea, headaches, fatigue and jaundice, state health officials said. Infants are considered to be at greatest risk.
 
Dim Hope for Quick Solution
 On Thursday, Gov. Bruce Sundlun signed an executive order declaring a state of emergency in this city of 72,000 people and the neighboring towns of Central Falls and Cumberland. A day earlier, he had asked for economic disaster relief from the Federal Small Business Administration.
While city crews have been flushing out water mains and adding chlorine and acid to the system in efforts to get rid of the bacteria, the restrictions could be in effect for a month, said Peter Kerwin, a community affairs aide.
Assistant Fire Chief Robert Forsher said officials were delivering bottled water to disabled residents free of charge.
The emergency has been a boon to retailers who sell bottled water and entrepreneurs like Lewis Watkins, 23 years old, who was selling T-shirts outside City Hall last week. His shirts show a disgruntled family carrying jugs of water with the caption "Pawtucket Water Buffaloes."
"I wanted to do something to get people laughing, something positive," Mr. Watkins said.
There have been plenty of negatives. After complaints were received about some retailers, Mayor Robert E. Metivier warned that price gougers trying to take advantage of the shortage would be prosecuted.
Donations of water from distributors of beer, soft drinks and bottled spring water from outside the city have helped ease the emergency at nursing homes and other health-care centers.
Memorial Hospital, the area's largest medical center, has been drawing from its own emergency 8,000-gallon storage tank.
Debra Lafreniere, 33, carrying her daily ration of two gallons from a fire station, said of the situation: "It stinks. 'I'm having to pick up water all the time, and I don't have a car."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Republicans;
Bush Needs Convention to Get Campaign Going

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Aug. 15

 BODY:
Republicans began assembling here today for a nominating convention of extraordinary importance to the Bush Presidency. If the President's strategists have their way, this event will begin the redefinition of their candidate and the choice at the heart of this election.
Republican officials struck a note of determined optimism today as they readied the balloons and rituals for Monday's opening session, but the underlying anxiety was palpable. "George Bush has said all along that his campaign began with this convention," said Craig Fuller, the chairman of the convention. "We're going to prove it this week." 
 Most Republican experts acknowledge that Gov. Bill Clinton, the Democratic nominee, has had considerable success, so far, in presenting this election as a stark choice in economically troubled times: Change versus the status quo, a Democratic Presidency chock-full of domestic policy proposals or a Republican Presidency with little to say about the problems at home.
 
The Republican View
 Bush strategists hope to use this convention, and the two months that follow, to persuade voters that they have another choice: A second Bush Administration hot off its successes abroad, now ready to "target America" with a host of moderate to conservative reforms, or a return to the tired, failed, bureaucratic solutions of Democratic orthodoxy.
The White House has been working on new proposals intended to stimulate the economy and Mr. Bush suggested in an interview with Time magazine this weekend that such measures were imminent. There was a wave of rumors about the possiblity of new tax-cut proposals, fed, in part, by Housing Secretary Jack F. Kemp, who like many conservatives is a staunch advocate of that approach.
Mr. Bush told Time that his decision to break his 1988 campaign pledge of "no new taxes" and embrace the budget deal of 1990 was a mistake. "I'll be making some proposals regarding the economy that I'm not going to discuss now that I think will take care of it," he said.
Still, the content of Mr. Bush's acceptance speech, which he was working on at Camp David today and will deliver Thursday night, was a closely held secret. Four years ago Mr. Bush used his acceptance speech to mount a powerful comeback against Michael S. Dukakis.
This time, however, Mr. Bush enters the convention with a much greater deficit in the public opinion polls, nearly 20 percentage points in some surveys released this week, and with a far bleaker national mood.
For eight months, Bush strategists have struggled to retrofit Mr. Bush, a President consumed with foreign policy, for a country consumed with the economy and other domestic concerns. Now, with the President fully focused on the campaign, with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d at his side, and with a scant 80 days before the election, they feel they have their best, most crucial shot.
 
Campaign Map
 Mr. Baker's speech last week announcing his return to the White House is widely viewed as, in the words of one Bush campaign official, "a Rand McNally" for the coming weeks. It was an unapologetic accounting of the past four years and the Administration's focus on foreign policy, arguing that the United States had a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to help free millions of people and reduce the threat of nuclear war. Now, Mr. Baker asserted, it was time to "target America."
For all of that, the White House has seemed preoccupied with foreign affairs even as its top officials plotted a domestic political course as the convention neared. In the last few days, the White House has announced an airlift of food and supplies to famine-stricken Somalia, and has prepared for a confrontation with Iraq over United Nations inspections of its military facilities.
Bush campaign aides say it is still unclear how much Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker will rely on major new domestic proposals, and how much they will simply repackage what they have already outlined. Conservatives yearn for an aggressive economic plan.
Mr. Kemp said on CNN's "Evans and Novak" today that he believed the Administration was clearly moving toward new tax-cut proposals, although he said this was based on intuition rather than information. "It seems to me that it is now clear that the President, particularly since the Baker speech, wants to outline a bold and audacious vision of America in the next four years," Mr. Kemp said.
 
Ideological Contrast
 A senior Administration official said today, "During the course of the campaign I wouldn't be surprised if there's new things proposed." But, the official said, "you don't define the differences simply in terms of who has a long list of new programs."
In fact, the contrast they seek with Mr. Clinton is philosophical and ideological. James Cicconi, issues director for the Bush campaign, describes Mr. Clinton as having a "back to the future" approach; the Bush campaign has already begun casting Mr. Clinton's proposals on education, health care and the economy as excessively bureaucratic and based on massive taxing and spending.
One Republican strategist close to the Administration said it was time to make Mr. Clinton "defend the left-most element of his party."
Still, the Republicans continued to have a few ideological divisions of their own as they assembled here today -- principally over the issue of abortion, after a week that saw the party's platform committee retain an implacably anti-abortion line. Mr. Fuller told reporters today that he did not expect any speeches on behalf of abortion rights at the convention next week.
Bush strategists hope for a unified convention that raises doubts about Mr. Clinton, reminds Americans of Mr. Bush's accomplishments, and persuades them that the President does, in fact, have an aggressive domestic policy plan for his second term.
Mr. Bush has a formidable travel schedule in the weeks that follow, intended to capitalize on his expected "bounce" out of the convention. His strategists acknowledge that he still has work to do to shore up his standing in the South and in Texas.
"We may have to pay a little more attention to some of them because you've got an all-Southern Baptist ticket," said Charles Black, a senior adviser to the Bush campaign. "But the President through four years has run six to eight points better in the South than nationally, so I feel as soon as we get our momentum back, we'll be in fine shape in the region."
 
Southern Strategy
 Mr. Bush's first post-convention swing will focus on the South, "tamping it down early," as Mr. Black puts it.
Campaign officials are particularly sensitive to the situation in Texas, where a poll last week showed Mr. Bush, an adopted son, lagging behind Mr. Clinton. With California considered an uphill battle for the Republicans, it is essential that they be assured of carrying Florida and Texas. Still, Bush campaign officials say they remain confident that Mr. Clinton can be presented in Texas as far too liberal.
Mr. Bush will then move quickly into Illinois, Connecticut, New Jersey, Illinois, Michigan and Kentucky.
Mr. Bush's travel schedule represents the focus expected from both campaigns on the border states, which are more competitive this year because of the Southern Democratic ticket, and the industrial Midwest, which is historically a battleground.
Robert M. Teeter, the campaign chairman, said that the Bush campaign was not writing off California, despite a poll that showed Mr. Clinton more than 30 points ahead there. "We think, in the last analysis, California, as it's been for the past 25 years, will be very close."
Mr. Teeter added that he remained confident that the comparison between the candidates would ultimately mean a Bush victory. "If you stand George Bush up, with a bright light on him, and say here's exactly who he is in terms of qualifications, values, positions, and you stand Bill Clinton up, with no window dressing on either one, we win."

HEADLINE: A First Job Fades as the Paper Route Grows Up

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH

 BODY:
Eventually the newspaper strike that is afflicting the Pittsburgh area will be settled. Some of the teamsters who walked off the job in May will return to their jobs as truck drivers, and some presumably won't. But some people who have been idled know already that they have lost their jobs for good, like Bobby Griska, who is 14 years old.
Bobby is a paperboy, one of 4,300 young door-to-door carriers who delivered The Pittsburgh Press and The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Under the newspapers' plan for more efficient home delivery, all 4,300 young carriers have been dismissed. They will be replaced by far fewer adults who can cover longer routes by flinging the papers onto lawns from car windows. 
 The Pittsburgh papers are following the lead of most big-city dailies, which, faced with declining readership and dwindling advertising revenues, are saving wherever they can. "We can't stay in business trying to stay with a tradition that has outlived its usefulness," said Randall Notter, a spokesman for The Press.
 
Disney, Perot, Buffett
 Through the years, no institution has stirred the entrepreneurial juices of young Americans as much as delivering newspapers. Benjamin Franklin, so the legend goes, hustled his brother James's New England Courant around Boston. Businessmen like Walt Disney, Ross Perot and Warren Buffett started out delivering papers. Even today, many parents say it is an irreplaceable tool for teaching responsibility, money management and people skills.
Retracing his old route, Bobby pointed to a house on Brierly Lane. The woman there, he said, wanted the Sunday comics and living sections delivered on Saturday evening, when Bobby received them. Only one family, who live in a big yellow house on Brierly, never tipped him. What about his other customers? "I don't ask for a tip," he said. "They just give it to me."
Along with baby-sitting, acting and family farming, having a paper route is one of a very few regular jobs that the Federal Government exempts from the child labor laws. Some youngsters around Pittsburgh started out at 8 years old, six years before the laws permit them to try other jobs. Because parents get involved, cases of abuse and exploitation have been rare.
 
The Realities of Business
 For Bobby, a paper route with about 50 customers meant 6 1/4 cents for each daily paper he delivered, 20 1/4 cents for each Sunday paper. With the tips, he earned $25 to $40 a week.
But merciless realities of business and economics have intruded. The International Association of Circulation Managers says that from 1980 to 1990, the number of newspaper carriers plunged from 912,534 to 551,356, while the number of papers printed each day stayed the same, about 62 million. For carriers under 18, the decline was even sharper, from 823,746, or 90 percent of all carriers, to 362,470, or 66 percent.
Joseph Forsee, head of the association, said a decline in the number of evening newspapers, which children can deliver right after school, accounts for much of the business youngsters have lost.
But another factor, a strong one in Pittsburgh, is the growth in publishers' use of adult carriers, many of whom cannot find other jobs. Without school to face, they can rise earlier than children to deliver morning papers, which have absorbed the circulation that evening papers have lost.
 
The Realities of Population
 In addition, Mr. Notter said, young carriers have become harder to find. The nation's birth rate has plunged since the 60's; because of that and people moving away, he said, Pittsburgh had 40 percent fewer people between the ages of 12 and 17 in 1990 than in 1980.
Finally, in some cities, though rarely in Pittsburgh, parents' fears about crime have made them reluctant to send 10-year-olds out alone.
For reasons like these, the number of adult carriers, concentrated in big cities and their suburbs, jumped in the 1980's by 100,000, to 188,886. These are troubling trends to families here who believe in the discipline of working a regular newspaper route.
Glenn D. Joyce was a newspaper boy, and all five of his children -- three boys and two girls -- delivered papers. Four went on to graduate from Carnegie Mellon University, and the fifth is a senior there.
"The discipline sure helped," said Mr. Joyce's wife, Marie, "and it gave them a nest egg to start college. You learn how to work for a living. It makes you do something when you have to do it. It expanded them socially. They had grumpy people. They had the weirdos. There were high tippers. There were low tippers. There was the guy who complained if his paper had a single raindrop on it."
 
The Rewards of Money
 Before the strike, George and Susan Kenyon, who live in the suburb of Monroeville, had set their children on a course like that of the Joyce children. Kathy, the eldest, is going to college in Indiana in the fall. With her father out of a job and her mother working part time, the money she saved from her newspaper job will pay for most of her first year. Carrie, 16, and Buffy, 15, shared a route delivering The Press. Susie, 13, had a morning route delivering The Post-Gazette, and Bobby, 11, had his own route delivering the afternoon Press.
"They buy almost all their own clothes," Mrs. Kenyon said. "They don't realize that that's not the norm."
The youngest, Bobby, did not fully share his parents' enthusiasm for the job. "There are things you want to do, but you have to walk out and go do papers," he complained. "I've been bit by the same dog three times, same leg." But he recognizes the rewards of his toil. He and Susie recently flew to Miami, a trip paid for with savings from delivering newspapers.
 
Far Fewer Depots
 The Press, which is owned by the E. W. Scripps chain, also prints and distributes the separately owned Post-Gazette, the morning paper. Until the strike started, The Press's delivery system was built on the 605 members of Teamsters Local 211 -- drivers who dropped bundles of papers at 10,000 locations a day, mostly in front of carriers' homes, and route managers who recruited and supervised the carriers.
To cut costs, The Press intends to replace the curbside deliveries with just 30 depots to which far fewer drivers will bring the papers. Instead of boys and girls, about 1,300 self-employed adults will pick up the papers at the depots and deliver them over much longer routes from their cars. Although the Press never said flatly that children could not hold the jobs, it is requiring carriers to have "a dependable insured vehicle."
Local 211 called the strike on May 17, when The Press tried to open its first two depots. The president of the local, Joseph A. Molinero, says the union cannot hope to stop the company's plan, but he wants to slow the pace. He also seeks better severance arrangements for the more than 200 teamsters who would probably be laid off right after a settlement, some 250 fewer than the company originally wanted to lay off.
 
A Cheaper, Adult System
 It appears cheaper to build a system on adult, nonunion, independent carriers earning little more than $12,000 a year than on young carriers and on teamsters, who receive an average of $43,000, not including benefits. And with the demise of Pittsburgh's heavy industry, The Press has found plenty of adults who are willing to take jobs once done by children.
But however much sympathy the union has been drumming up for the young carriers, no one is going to the mat over their jobs.
Local 211 and officials of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. who are here lending a hand say they have tried to induce management to help. They have asked that those who can walk to the new depots be given routes, and that disabled children with routes be allowed to keep them.
The union has also sponsored demonstrations by carriers and their parents to turn subscribers and advertisers against the company's plan.
 
Its Own Jobs First
 But inevitably the union is putting the jobs of its own members first, and a settlement is unlikely to save any of the carriers' jobs. "We don't have anything for them," Mr. Notter of The Press said.
Some young carriers, like LeVar Fairrior, 12, hang around the strike headquarters in downtown Pittsburgh doing volunteer work, even though there is nothing in it for them. LeVar, an honor student, has lost a coveted route in an apartment building delivering 23 copies of The Press weekdays and 49 on Sundays.
Of the $20 to $25 he earned each week, he said, he saved $10 and spent the rest on ice cream and pizza. Now, he said: "I baby-sit for my sister's daughter. She's 6 months. And I do things for my mom." He said his mother, who is divorced, gives him $10 a week for helping her.
Some people here say management could arrive at a better balance of all the competing needs. Edmund Ayoub, an adjunct professor of economics at Duquesne University here who was a chief economist for the United Steelworkers union, feels that way. "I think there is something wrong in doing away with a system in which young people are encouraged to be self-reliant and independent," he said.

HEADLINE: Nonstop, Year-Round Casino Approval Stuns Monitors

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTIC CITY, Aug. 15

 BODY:
On a midweek morning at an hour when the sun is just starting to break over the Boardwalk, Joann Loucka stood before a dollar slot machine, barking words of encouragement to her best friend, Sophia Nicolan.
"Hurry up before the machine gets cold," Mrs. Loucka said. 
 For the last 16 hours, almost from the moment they arrived by car from Ohio, the women had been pumping coins into slot machines on the cavernous Taj Mahal Casino floor.
"We came in yesterday at 2 o'clock and we haven't been to bed yet," said Mrs. Loucka. "When are we going to bed, I can't tell you."
A month after the state Casino Control Commission approved round-the-clock gambling at this seaside resort's 12 casinos, neither champions nor critics have had the time to gauge its real impact. But the bill that allowed 24-hour gambling, which Gov. Jim Florio signed on May 16, was the most drastic easing of regulations on the state's gambling industry since 1976, when voters approved casino gambling in Atlantic City.
 
Conditions Originally Strict
 Fearing the possibilities of organized crime and an increase in compulsive gambling, the Legislature initially placed strict conditions on the casinos, including limiting their hours to 10 A.M. to 4 A.M. on weekdays and 10 A.M. to 6 A.M. on weekends.
A year ago, the Legislature authorized a test of 24-hour gambling on weekends and holidays, and in May gave the commission the authority to allow permanent nonstop gambling as it saw fit. After twice balking at round-the-clock gambling, a month ago the Commission bowed to pressure from the casinos, business groups and politicians and allowed it all year long. The only stipulation was that the casinos had to make quarterly reports on its impact.
The Commission's open-ended decision angered a sponsor of the 24-hour gambling legislation, Assemblyman Monroe Jay Lustbader of Short Hills, who said on Friday that he would introduce legislation next month that would restrict 24-hour gambling to certain times of the year, as he intended his original bill to do.
"I consider the Casino Commission's action an abuse of the last legislation and illegal," Mr. Lustbader said. "There was always a certain reluctance to grant round-the-clock gambling indefinitely because there was a feeling that there has to be a break in those hours to give the people a chance psychologically to cool off to avoid people losing the rent money in a froth.
 
Casinos Got 'the Whole Pie'
 "All I was trying to do was to work out a compromise with my legislation between those who wanted 24-hour gambling and those who were opposed to it," he said. "But it seems the casino industry walked away with the whole pie."
Mr. Lustbader said his new bill would authorize 24-hour gambling up to five days in a row plus weekends and holidays, but never exceeding 12 consecutive days.
The debate over 24-hour gambling is as old as legalized gambling itself in this seaside town.
"This has been a 14-year effort to convince the state of New Jersey since they have entertained this industry, then they have to let it be an industry," said Thomas D. Carver, president of the Casino Association of New Jersey, the legislative lobbying and policy organization for the Atlantic City gambling industry.
Along with nonstop play at the slot machines and at a dozen or so table games now offered, Atlantic City casino operators would like to add table poker, sports betting and keno, a gambling game resembling bingo.
"It's like saying we're a baseball team but we only have two outfielders," said Mr. Carver.
 
Longing Looks at Nevada
 Atlantic City's casinos have looked longingly at Nevada, with its much less restrictive gambling laws.
An 8 percent New Jersey tax on the casinos' gross gambling profits funnels nearly $250 million a year into the treasury. By law, the money is used for programs for the elderly.
Proponents of 24-hour gambling say the extended hours will add about 1,200 jobs, $20 million in taxes and about $100 million to the 12 casinos' annual $3.3 billion grosses.
The casinos have amassed statewide political influence well beyond the traditional group of legislators from southern New Jersey who led the fight 16 years ago for gambling.
Despite what Mr. Carver describes as restrictions "to prevent us from running at full speed," Atlantic City's East Coast casino monopoly helped make it one of the top tourist draws in the nation -- 30 million visitors a year, many arriving on tour buses for four-hour gambling sprees.
 
Twilighters Follow After Bus People
 The bus people, as they are known to casino workers, have yet to find a niche in the new early hours, leaving the sparsely populated floors to another breed of players called the twilighters.
"I personally like them better; they know what they are doing," said Anthony Fama, over breakfast in an employee cafeteria at the Taj Mahal during one of his 15-minute breaks from the roulette wheel he spins.
"No mama and papa bus people," he said as he returned to the casino floor to continue a shift that began at 4 A.M. and would end at noon.
For Mr. Fama, 33, and the 75,000 other employees of Atlantic City's gambling industry, the additional hours mean an added sense of job security in a business that has been linked inexorably to the whims of the economy and to seasonal tourism.
Also, Atlantic City's lucrative monopoly is swiftly eroding with the advent of casino gambling on an Indian reservation in Connecticut and as other states consider legalized gambling to help close budget gaps.
Miles away in Trenton, in a cluttered office wallpapered with newspaper clippings, letters and telephone lists, Arnold Wexler, executive director of the Council on Compulsive Gambling of New Jersey, gives the opposing argument to all that the casinos would envision.
"Twenty-four-hour casino gaming will contribute to compulsive gambling," Mr. Wexler says.
Under state law, the casinos finance the council's $500,000 annual budget through the fines they pay. And they are required to display the compulsive gambling emergency phone number -- (800) GAMBLER -- throughout their gambling halls, on slot machines and in all their literature along with the slogan: "Bet with your head, not over it."
Mr. Carver said that with the start of 24-hour gambling, the casinos had begun a plan in which a compulsive gambler would sign a statement acknowledging his problem and would then be barred from betting.
A recovering compulsive gambler himself, Mr. Wexler bases his prediction on his own experiences and the rise in emergency calls in the short time since nonstop gambling began.
"You never know what you are going to hear," he says.
Almost on cue, a telephone on his desk rings, and the caller begins the conversation with what Mr. Wexler says is a familiar refrain.
"I think I have a gambling problem," says the man, who in keeping with the council's policy cannot be identified by name.
"I don't want my wife to know nothing," says the man, who identifies himself as a 54-year-old retiree. "I just had the worst streak of my whole life. I lost about $7,000."
Mr. Wexler leafs through a sheaf of papers to find a Gamblers Anonymous meeting place and date closest to the caller's Pennsylvania home.
"I know exactly what you mean," Mr. Wexler says as he tries to comfort the now-sobbing caller, "I've been there, baby."

HEADLINE: A Year After Coup, Gorbachev Grumps, Rues and Ruminates

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Aug. 15

 BODY:
The man who had the most to lose -- and lost almost everything -- after last August's attempted coup was President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
One year later, the former President of a country that no longer exists is now the head of the International Foundation of Socio-Economic and Political Research, which is housed in a vast complex that was built as a higher party school for foreign Communist leaders. 
 Since his final fall from power last Dec. 25, when the Soviet Union was officially declared dead, Mr. Gorbachev has struggled valiantly to keep himself visible and politically viable.
He has traveled abroad -- to Germany, the United States and Japan -- cashing in on his appeal to foreign audiences. But at home, he has been kept on the sidelines, scorned by his old enemy, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia, and ignored by an unsympathetic population.
 
Grumbling in Print
 Mr. Gorbachev, now 61 years old, appears regularly in the pages of the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda where he worries out loud about the course taken by the Yeltsin Government and continues to mourn the demise of the old Soviet Union.
Although some members of the conspiracy have since claimed that Mr. Gorbachev himself had been preparing to declare a state of emergency in the Soviet Union last summer, he has vehemently denied giving the conspirators any encouragement.
"Above all, they were striking a blow against the reform process," he said in a recent interview. "Before you stands the President whom they locked up and seized power from, taking over his functions by coercion."
Looking back, Mr. Gorbachev recently admitted that he had blundered when, upon his release from his villa in the Crimea, he did not go immediately to lay flowers at the place where three young men were killed in the early hours of Aug. 21, as the army tanks began their retreat from Moscow.
"Of course, I should have done that," Mr. Gorbachev told Moscow Ogonyok, a weekly. "I can't find an explanation. Probably, it was the shock of the situation I found myself in."

HEADLINE: More on Reaganomics

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Time to Get Back to Reaganomics" (Forum, July 26), Edwin S. Rubenstein derides both the Congressional Budget Office's data as being "seriously flawed," and Massachusetts Institute of Technology Prof. Paul Krugman's analysis of income growth based on that data, which showed that "the wealthiest 1 percent of American families received 60 percent of total income growth during the 1980's." 
 According to Mr. Rubenstein, the C.B.O. estimated "the average income of the top 1 percent of families increased from $289,743 (in 1990 dollars) in 1977, to $548,970 in 1990, a 94.2 percent rise. Capital gains, up 171 percent, was allegedly the fastest-growing source of income . . . but the budget office failed to adjust capital gains for inflation."
Mr. Rubenstein then demonstrates the isolated "logic" of the financial elite he champions: "someone who bought an asset for $50,000 in 1977 and sold it for $100,000 in 1990 had a capital gain of $50,000, even though -- adjusted for inflation -- the asset really sold for less than its purchase price."
Interesting.
Internal Revenue Service data show that after a decade of Reaganomics, 85 percent of American families still earned less than $50,000 (and 94 percent less than $75,000). Therefore, to use Mr. Rubenstein's own example, because of inflation, 94 percent of American families had negative income growth. Further, I.R.S. statistics show that 93 percent of American tax filers in 1989 received zero capital gains income.
Reaganomics has been and will continue to be Robin Hood-ism in reverse, viz., thieving from the have-nots to benefit the rich.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN;
Parties' Core Differences in Platforms

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Aug. 15

 BODY:
To a remarkable degree, the party platforms they wrote this summer define the state of the Democratic and Republican Parties and highlight the differences between them.
The Democrats, like their Presidential candidate, Bill Clinton, are seeking new ground, a footing that they hope the American people will find more comfortable than the doctrinaire liberalism that has characterized the party in the last half of this century. 
 Their platform calls it "a third way," a course between the laissez-faire capitalism of the Republicans and the welfare-state economics that the Democrats have relied on in the past. Wherever possible, the Democrats seem to have toned down their language.
"We believe in an activist Government," the platform declares, "but it must work in a different, more responsive way."
The Republican platform, by contrast, hugs the right-hand lane, taking the most conservative turn on nearly every issue. Few people here for the Republican convention seem to mind that it goes far beyond President Bush's stands on issues like abortion. The strident language seems to appeal to the party faithful.
 
Emphasizing Social Views
 "We believe in traditional family values and in the Judeo-Christian heritage," the Republicans asserted, emphasizing social views and playing down the economy for the first time in many conventions.
The platforms themselves will soon be forgotten. Even in the election campaign this fall, the candidates will stake out their own positions with little regard to the statements of principle adopted at their party conventions.
But looking back over the years, platforms have often forecast, in themes if not in words, changes in parties' direction.
That was certainly true in 1980, when diehard conservatives first gained firm control of Republican Party affairs. Some Democrats believe it is the case this year for their party, with a new emphasis on personal responsibility rather than Government handouts, on private enterprise instead of Government subsidies.
 
Positions Are Poles Apart
 On specific issues, the platforms are often poles apart.
The most striking example, of course, is abortion, where the Democratic platform supports a woman's right to abortion without exception, and the Republican one would make abortion illegal, also without exception.
But there are many other cases when the parties are just as far apart.
Democrats want a medical care system in which the Government is deeply involved. Republicans want to keep the Government out.
Republicans favor tuition subsidies for private school tuition. Democrats want to redistribute money to public schools so those in prosperous communities do not have so much more than those in poor ones.
Democrats favor gun control; Republicans are opposed. Democrats favor civil rights laws protecting homosexuals; Republicans are opposed. Democrats want to spend billions on public works projects; Republicans stress private investment. Democrats emphasize the need for child care for working parents; Republicans want to change tax rules so children can be cared for at home less expensively.
 
Differences of Principle
 But for all the differences on particular political issues, the most important differences expressed in the platform are over matters of principle.
The basic economic principle enunciated in the Republican document is that taxes should be cut across the board. Americans, the Republicans say, should be allowed "to create wealth for themselves and their communities."
The Democrats put their fundamental economic tenet this way: "People should share in society's common costs according to their ability to pay." With that in mind, the platform calls for higher taxes on the wealthy.
In the case of the environment and energy policy, the Democratic principle is that environmental protection and energy conservation need not take a back seat to economic growth. Republicans, on the other hand, hold that the environment may have to be sacrificed in some instances in the interest of a stronger economy. And their platform emphasizes energy production with no mention of conservation.
 
Division Over Government
 For the Democrats, the Government is the answer to many of the nation's problems. The party wants an "efficient, flexible and results-oriented government that improves services, expands choices and empowers citizens and communities to change our country."
For Republicans, the Government is a necessity of last resort. "Government does not have all the answers," their platform states. "But we know where to find them: in the spirit of our people."
Each platform begins with the wisdom of its party's wellspring.
The Democrats cite Thomas Jefferson who believed, the platform states: "We should overthrow our own government every 20 years to renew our freedom and keep pace with a changing world."
The Republicans quote Abraham Lincoln: "In all that people can individually do as well for themselves, Government ought not to interfere."

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Compare and Contrast: Quotes From the Platforms"
 
THE 1980's
 Repbulicans: We launched an era of growth and prosperity such as the world had never seen. . . . During the 1980's and into the present decade, the U.S. economy once again became the engine of global growth.
 Democrats: We need to rebuild America by abandoning the something-for-nothing ethic of the last decade. . . . It is wrong to borrow on ourselves, leaving our children to pay our debts.
 
THE ECONOMY
 Republicans: Inflation has fallen to its lowest level in 30 years. Interest rates dropped 15 percentage points. Productivity has sharply risen. Exports are booming. Despite a global downturn in late 1990, real economic growth resumed last year and has continued for five consecutive quarters. With low interest rates and low inflation, the American economy is poised for stronger growth through the rest of the 1990's.
 Democrats: America is on the wrong track. The American people are hurting. The American dream of expanding opportunity has faded. Middle-class families are working hard, playing by the rules, but still falling behind. Poverty has exploded.
 
FOREIGN AFFAIRS
 Republicans: Never in this century has the United States enjoyed such security from foreign enemies. With President Bush leading the free world, the Soviet empire has collapsed. . . . Eastern Europe is liberated. Germany is peacefully united. The former Soviet armies are returning home. Nuclear arsenals are being cut to fractions of their former size. A democratically elected Russian president sits in the Kremlin. Ukraine, Armenia and the Baltic states take their rightful place among the family of nations. Israel and all of its Arab neighbors talk face to face for the first time. Nicaragua and Panama celebrate democracy.
 Democrats: During the past four years, we have seen the corrosive effect of foreign policies that are rooted in the past, divorced from our values, fearful of change and unable to meet its challenges. Under President Bush, crises have been managed rather than prevented; dictators like Saddam Hussein have been wooed rather than deterred; aggression by the Serbian regime against its neighbors in what was Yugoslavia has been met by American timidity rather than toughness; human rights abusers have been rewarded, not challenged.
 
 ROLE OF GOVERNMENT
 Republicans: We believe government has a legitimate role to play in our national life, but government must never dominate that life. . . . The Democrats argue that government must constantly override the market. Republicans regard the worst market failure as the failure to have a market.
 Democrats: We believe in an activist government, but it must work in a different, more responsive way. . . . We believe in . . . the power of market forces. But economic growth will not come without a national economic strategy.
 
PUBLIC WORKS
 Republicans: The latest Democrat scam is to raise taxes for 'investment' -- a code word for more government spending. A Republican Congress will foster investment where it does the most good, by individuals within the private sector.
 Democrats: The only way to lay the foundation for renewed American prosperity is to spur both public and private investment . . . We will rebuild America by investing more in transportation, environmental technologies, defense conversion and a national information network.
 
ABORTION
 Republicans: We believe the unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed. We therefore reaffirm our support for a human life amendment to the Constitution, and we endorse legislation to make clear that the Fourteenth Amendment's protections apply to unborn children. We oppose using public revenues for abortion and will not fund organizations which advocate it. We commend those who provide alternatives to abortion by meeting the needs of mothers and offering adoption services. We reaffirm our support for appointment of judges who respect traditional family values and the sanctity of innocent human life.
 Democrats: Democrats stand behind the right of every woman to choose, consistent with Roe v. Wade, regardless of ability to pay, and support a national law to protect that right. It is a fundamental constitutional liberty that individual Americans -- not government -- can best take responsibility for making the most difficult and intensely personal decisions regarding reproduction. The goal of our nation must be to make abortion less necessary, not more difficult or dangerous. We pledge to support contraceptive research, family planning, comprehensive family life education and policies that support healthy childbearing and enable parents to care most effectively for their children.
 
EDUCATION
 Republicans: The President has shown unprecedented leadership for he most important education goal of all: helping middle and low income families enjoy the same choice of schools -- public, private or religious -- that families with more resources already have.
 Democrats: We deplore the Bush Administration's efforts to bankrupt the public schools system . . . through private school vouchers. . . . We deplore the savage inequalities among public schools across the land.
 
HOMOSEXUAL RIGHTS
 Republicans: We oppose efforts by the Democratic Party to include sexual preference as a protected minority receiving preferential status under civil rights statutes at the Federal, state and local level.
 Democrats: Democrats will continue to lead the fight to ensure that no Americans suffer discrimination or deprivation of rights on the basis of . . . sexual orientation or other characteristics irrelevant to ability.
 
ARTS
 Republicans: We . . . condemn the use of public funds to subsidize obscenity and blasphemy masquerading as art. . . . No artist has an inherent right to claim taxpayer support for his or her private vision of art if that vision mocks the moral and spiritual basis on which our society is founded.
 Democrats: We believe in public support for the arts . . . that is free from political manipulation and firmly rooted in the First Amendment's freedom of expression guarantee.
 
ENVIRONMENT
 Republicans: We have taught the world three vital lessons: First, environmental progress is integrally related to economic advancement. Second, economic growth generates the capital to pay for environment gains. Third, private ownership and economic freedom are the best security against environmental degradation.
 Democrats: We will protect our old-growth forests, preserve critical habitats, provide a genuine 'no net loss' policy on wetlands, conserve the critical resources of soil, water and air, oppose new offshore oil drilling and mineral exploration and production in our nation's many environmentally critical areas and address ocean pollution by reducing oil and toxic waste spills at sea.
 
GUN CONTROL
 Republicans: Republicans defend the constitutional right to keep and bear arms. We call for stiff mandatory sentences for those who use firearms in a crime. We note that those who seek to disarm citizens in their homes are the same liberals who tried to disarm our nation during the cold war.
 Democrats: We support a reasonable waiting period to permit background checks for the purchases of handguns, as well as assault weapons controls to ban the possession, sale, importation and manufacture of the most deadly assault weapons. . . . We will work for . . . stronger sentences for criminals who use guns.
 
HEALTH
Republicans: Republicans believe government control of health care is irresponsible and ineffective. We believe health care choices should remain in the hands of the people, not government bureaucrats.
 Democrats: All Americans should have universal access to quality, affordable health care -- not as a privilege but as a right.

At Play In the Fields Of the Vinca

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP

DATELINE: STORRS, Conn.

 BODY:
ON a hill here behind a padlocked gate and electrified fences, Prof. Ronald Parker, a plant breeder, hides his world-famous vinca test fields. "I must be cautious," he says. "I've had people try to bribe my research crews to tell them where these fields are. You're the only one who's been in the vinca fields this year."
It is not that the vinca is exotic. On the contrary. The University of Connecticut professor's genius lies in his ability to develop a colorful flowering annual that is perfect for your typical idiot suburban gardener. No need to water vincas. They love heat. Deer and bugs hate them. 
 Every seed company president in America has tried to get into Professor Parker's vinca fields. Instead he makes these millionaire executives sit in his office, bringing them a single flower from a few plants. "If they saw the whole plant, they'd have an insight into how many flowers I'm getting per plant. It gives away too much."
When he started breeding vincas 16 years ago, they came in white. Because of his painstaking work mating species from all over the world, vincas now flower in every shade of pink, purple and orange. In the last two years he has won four All-America Selections awards, the Pulitzers of plant breeding, for vincas like Pretty in Pink. And he is not through, not by a long shot.
"We have a red coming out that is so incredible -- yes it's all right, you can print this -- it will be so demanded. No one's ever seen a red vinca." He does not keep the reds here. "Oh no. They're so valuable I keep them secure in another state."
He is a driven, methodical man, as you must be when you devote your life to isolating desirable genetic variables like overlapping petals. At work by 7, he goes out for lunch at noon: soup and milk in the no-smoking section. He is a devout Mormon. At age 56, he works out daily. In growing season he acknowledges not being the easiest guy to live with, ("My family does not expect a happy person.") To make sure there are no mixups, he and two assistants do all the planting: 35,000 sprouts during a few weeks in spring. He is so harried, rushing between class and fields, there are days he plants in white shirt and tie. ("And I can do it without getting my shirt dirty.")
Long ago he could have worked for the big seed companies at twice the salary, but he stays in academia for the intellectual freedom to breed as he pleases. "Plant breeding is nothing but unadulterated sex and I love it." He has a gift for looking at a scraggly vinca species and spotting one characteristic -- like big flowers -- that is worth extracting. He can then spend years mating the scraggly one to various short, shapely species, finally producing a big-flowered, short, shapely vinca. "The big breakthroughs are unguessable. Often the children don't look like either parent."
Among his current projects is developing a blue vinca. "I only found the key to blues last year after years of trying. I don't know if anybody else knows the key to blues. I don't ask because I don't want anybody to ask me."
When people say, "Why vincas?" he answers, "That's easy." In 1976 he spent months in libraries in search of a hardy flower that hadn't reached its potential. You could drop a boiling elephant on a vinca and it would survive, but it wasn't colorful or nicely shaped.
Now it is.
Anyone who questions the economic value of this doesn't know the story of impatiens, another high-performance, low-maintenance annual with flower, foliage and shape like the vinca. The impatiens is shade-loving and there are many who feel the vinca is about to become its sun-loving counterpart. Big deal? The impatiens now accounts for 45 percent of all summer annuals sold.
In recent years vincas (technically catharanthus) have gone from 3 percent to about 13 percent of the market. Professor Parker's vinca patents earn UConn good money; he is one of the top royalty producers here.
The reason is obvious. You spend an hour planting vincas and impatiens Memorial Day weekend, you don't do another thing, they make colorful, lush borders; and when friends from the city visit, they marvel at how you found time to watch the entire Olympics on three cable stations.
In a few weeks Professor Parker begins a sabbatical to assess new projects. He believes there is great hunger for more shade-loving varieties and thinks much can still be done with impatiens, which he has started breeding. "There are no blue impatiens, no yellows. Your eye feels their absence." He paused in his tour. "We all have our objectives. One of mine before I die is to see a bed of yellow impatiens. I'm working on it. I thought I cracked it last month -- yes, it's O.K. to print that."

HEADLINE: The Latest in Buzzwords: Mailed From America

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS; Andree Brooks, based in Westport, Conn., writes regularly on financial and family topics.

 BODY:
After celebrating morning mass at the Good Shepherd Church near his modest brick flat in Morecambe, a seaside resort in Lancashire, England, the Rev. Michael J. Smith eagerly watches for a little green van that more and more often is pulling up to his front door.
The van signals the arrival of yet another product he has ordered by mail from the United States. Since he first saw an advertisement for mail-order shopping direct from the United States in a computer magazine about two years ago, Father Smith reckons he has spent more than $4,000, mostly on computer software. 
 Move over Coca-Cola, Disney, blue jeans, Hollywood and all those other tempting slices of Americana that have captivated foreigners. The newest overseas obsessions among consumers like Father Smith are the value and new ease of international shopping offered by mail-order companies like L. L. Bean, Austad's, the Sharper Image and Lands' End.
While many of the better-known companies have always had the occasional foreign order come in, the volume of that business until recently did not warrant special marketing efforts. But such recent innovations as inexpensive facsimile machines, international toll-free calling, freer use of credit cards and speedier air-courier delivery -- not to mention a glutted, recession-hit home market -- have all led to rising interest in American mail-order operations overseas.
Drawn by efficient service and a variety of products unmatched by their local merchants, foreign shoppers in record numbers are phoning, faxing and mailing orders for everything from clothing to electronic gear to golf equipment. Indeed, the typical wee-hours customer is no longer an American insomniac, but perhaps a morning shopper from Europe.
Father Smith said much of the software he has bought cost half of what it would locally, even taking into account the overseas shipping charges, import duties and value-added tax. He just puts it all on his Mastercard, letting the banks worry about the currency exchange.
"And there's so much to choose from," he said in a telephone interview. Then he chuckled, "I also do it for the fun. I'd never phoned outside the country before. But at first I tried just because it was free. I asked them whether I was really speaking to someone in Arizona and what time of day it was. Now we talk about all sort of things. Did you know they have flash floods in that part of America? Worse rain than in Lancashire."
Express Technology Inc. of Scottsdale, Ariz., which Father Smith often calls, sells products only to overseas shoppers. It says it grossed $100,000 from foreign callers in a single week in July, a record for the five-year-old computer software company.
Two years ago, L. L. Bean, the venerable bit of Americana based in Freeport, Me., organized an international department aimed at pampering a new source of customers. Last year, the gross from overseas was $38 million, 6 percent of total sales. Compare that to $2 million in 1986.
Overseas sales by Bose Express Music of Framingham, Mass., a division of the Bose Corporation, which lists a wide variety of compact disks and tapes in its 300-page catalogue, are running at $1.5 million annually compared with $100,000 two years ago. Such sales now represent 7 percent of all sales. Its paid listing in Compuserve, the worldwide electronic information network for computer users, has been the source of many of these customers, especially from Japan, said Robert Hurley, Bose Express's general manager.
The Sharper Image of San Francisco, which offers unusual electronic gear and other items, says it now deals with some 7,000 overseas customers annually from its regular catalogue, compared with a handful a decade ago. "It's a nice piece of business," said Sydney Klevatt, the company's senior vice president for marketing. Moreover, he said, the average overseas order is about $400 compared with $150 for a domestic one.
Austad's, the golfing-equipment company based in Sioux Falls, S.D., estimates that foreign mail-order sales now total 3 percent of its total revenues, compared with a fraction of that five years ago. Fax orders roll in from Saudi Arabia, South America, South Africa, Britain and Sweden. Sales to the golf-crazy Japanese rose 88 percent between 1991 and 1992, the company says.
Lands' End, after watching overseas business increasingly trickle in all by itself, created a special catalogue for the British market last fall in its first overt plunge into international waters.
Indeed, the phenomenon has attracted its own entrepreneurs. Consider Richard McBrien, from East Dulwich, just south of London. Familiar with such shopping from his 1980's student days at Yale University and the State University of New York at Buffalo, the 34-year-old writer and actor privately published a how-to book in Britain in June called "Buying Direct From the U.S.A."
Distributed exclusively by mail order, of course, Mr. McBrien's first print run of 100 books sold out in two weeks at 12.95 each, about $25. It is now in its third printing (total: 900 copies), he said, having sold everywhere from Spain to New Zealand.
Mr. McBrien practices what he preaches. He wrote the book with the help of a modem and software bought mail order from MicroWarehouse Inc., of Lakewood, N.J. He regularly faxes orders for hard-to-find replacement parts for his Karmann Ghia, an old Volkswagen sports model, from House of Ghia in Albany, Ore.
Perhaps the most aggressive approach has been taken by R.R. Donnelley & Sons of Chicago, the printing company that supplies dozens of American mail-order houses. Concerned about recessionary cutbacks and peaking domestic demand, Donnelley last fall offered the mail-order companies the chance to reach 50,000 Japanese households with an experimental showcase of American mail-order products.
In one catalogue, written in Japanese, it provided a sampling of the products of six companies together with information on how to send for each company's full catalogue.
G. Jack Haney, Donnelley's vice president for international direct marketing, said the results were encouraging enough to send a second mailing in May. A third is planned for distribution in Japan, Britain and Mexico at year's end.
Despite such efforts, there has been criticism from overseas that American mail-order houses in general are not doing enough to woo foreign customers.
"Too many American companies think we don't know what mail order is all about in Europe," said Peter Rosenwald, a former New Yorker living in London who is an international direct marketing consultant. "They're still not comfortable with the idea of the global market and how to act on it."
Even with the success of foreign sales by some companies today, only a handful offer international toll-free calling or special services for foreigners. Even Austad's limits its international toll-free lines to calls from Canada and Britain. "The orders didn't warrant the cost" of expansion elsewhere, said David Austad, the president. A.T.&T. estimates that 400 five-minute calls a month into Austad's Sioux Falls, S.D., headquarters from Japan would cost about $3,000.
To be sure, countries like Britain and Germany already had thriving mail-order houses of their own. But with the long-term decline of the value of the dollar, such local houses cannot compete right now with the bargains available direct from the United States.
In fact, the few American companies, like the Sharper Image and Lands' End, that have made deals with foreign licensees or have gone to the expense of starting foreign-language editions of their catalogues are not bragging about the results of those extra efforts.
As pointed out last month in The Financial Times of London, a man's cotton Oxford shirt listed in the British version of the Lands' End catalogue for 25.50 plus 2.95 for postage, about $55, could be ordered from the regular American catalogue for $23.50 -- even after adding duty, tax and shipping, a 25 percent saving.
David Zentmyer, Lands' End vice president for corporate ventures, defended the higher British-catalogue price by explaining how much more it cost the company to print a separate edition and establish a local branch to work with customers.
What he overlooks is the cachet that also comes with being able to brag about an overseas purchase.
Geoff Godfrey, vice president of marketing for Express Technology Inc., said his order takers had been hounded lately by "a group of guys calling from a pub in Leeds." The men, regular customers, seem to have fun showing off their secret of ordering hard-to-find software from the United States at any hour from a British public telephone.
 
 
TAKING ORDERS IN JAPANESE
 About five years ago, a Dutch tourist walked into Richard Gnant's store in Phoenix and bought his entire stock of 10 laptop computers. The tourist explained that he could easily recoup the cost of his trip by reselling them at a profit to friends back home.
That set Mr. Gnant to thinking that there was clearly an untapped overseas market for mail-order goods at American prices. So he reorganized his computer software and equipment company into Express Technology, a mail-order house that sells only to overseas shoppers.
"I didn't think you needed to spend a quarter of a million dollars opening an office overseas anymore," Mr. Gnant said. "Not with the new international 800 lines and the fax." Instead, he planned to pass along his lower operating costs in the form of savings to his customers.
Mr. Gnant also customized his operations. He hired order-takers who speak Spanish, German, French and Japanese and put most of them on duty from 2 A.M. to 9 A.M., his company's busiest hours.
He arranged for international toll-free calling and figured out how to remove the hassle of calculating duties and taxes from his customers. He worked out mailing arrangements with United Parcel Service, Airborne Express and DHL Worldwide Express. And he ran advertisements in computer magazines in Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Scandinavia and Latin America.
At first customers would call with "great trepridation in their voices," he said. But once they realized that the company stood by its guarantees, even refunding return postage costs for defective products, the hesitation disappeared.
By 1991, the company's sales reached $4.5 million.

HEADLINE: AUGUST 9-15: The Recession's Effects;
New York City Now Has 1 Million on Welfare

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

 BODY:
For the first time since the economic crisis of the 1970's, the number of New Yorkers on welfare last month rose above 1 million people -- almost one out of every seven city residents.
City officials blamed the sluggish economy for the 22 percent increase in the number of people on welfare since Mayor David N. Dinkins took office in January 1990. The number rose from 823,691 then to 1,005,210 last month. Of those now on welfare, 529,949 are children. 
 A survey of new welfare applicants conducted by the state Department of Social Services backed up the Dinkins Administration's claim. In June 1991, two-thirds of the people applying for Aid to Families with Dependent Children or Home Relief had worked in the prior year or were employed but earning very little. But the recession in New York City has lasted so long -- since the spring of 1989 -- that large numbers of unemployed workers have used up their unemployment benefits, forcing them onto welfare.
Other factors that account for the surge in welfare recipients included growing number of people with AIDS, addicts in drug treatment programs and impoverished immigrants, city officials said.

HEADLINE: Campaign Mode

 BODY:
Rewind to 1988 and humid New Orleans. George Bush trails a Democratic governor. His prospects are uncertain; the shadow of Ronald Reagan looms large. Mr. Bush makes a surprisingly good speech, jumps ahead and stays ahead during a relentless, unedifying campaign.
Fast forward to 1992 and Houston, another hot, humid Southern city. The same George Bush again trails his opponent, again a Democratic governor, this time by a wider margin. His record is mixed, his message unclear, his party divided. The economy is shaky, the public restless. And Bill Clinton, learning from Michael Dukakis's 1988 paralysis, has plunged into a far more energetic campaign. 
 Can the President, starting with another knockout acceptance speech, do it again? Many Republicans seem convinced that their convention, which opens tomorrow, is make-or-break time. It's surely important: Mr. Bush could definitely use a "bounce." But that puts too much weight on a made-for-television spectacle.
Conventions define themes and bridge competing views. And this convention could give definition to Mr. Bush, something he sorely needs. But conventions don't win elections. What this week truly marks is the beginning of the real battle, of what Mr. Bush likes to call the "campaign mode."
If one thing is clear about the race so far it is the public's vacillation. Remember March 1991? Mr. Bush's postwar approval rating was an astounding 88 percent. It's now about 30 percent. Bill Clinton wouldn't be riding his bus down America's blue highways if he had let the polls decide his fate. In late May, with Mr. Bush still comfortably ahead, USA Today awarded Mr. Clinton one state -- his own, with six electoral votes. By mid-July, according to the American Research Group, Mr. Clinton seemed a cinch. He led in 31 states. Mr. Bush led in only one, with three electoral votes.
So the pendulum swings. Bill Clinton never tires of warning that it could easily swing back.
The Houston convention will be a theme-a-night affair, and Republican planners will put Mr. Bush's best foot forward right away. Monday's theme is "America's Spirit in the World." It will showcase Mr. Bush in the role he likes best and in which he has arguably enjoyed his best moments -- Commander in Chief and world leader. That role would certainly be spotlighted if the U.S. carries through on reported plans to confront Saddam Hussein this week.
But what's most troubling voters isn't foreign policy but domestic drift, unemployment, the loss of competitive edge. When asked why he hasn't converted success abroad into progress at home, Mr. Bush recites, without passion or priorities, a list of proposals -- and blames Congress.
George Bush left New Orleans four years ago as the custodian of the Reagan revolution, albeit with a "kinder, gentler" face, and got by with a shallow campaign in part because the country was feeling pretty good about itself.
That feeling, like Mr. Reagan, is history. This convention is solely Mr. Bush's.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL: EQUALITY'S HURDLES - A Special Report;
Too Few Changes Since Campanis

BYLINE: The following article is based on reporting by Claire Smith, Gerald Eskenazi and William C. Rhoden and was written by Ms. Smith.

 BODY:
The comments came on national television, on the opening day of the baseball season, and when they spilled forth from Al Campanis on April 6, 1987, it was as if baseball, and all professional sports, for that matter, had been hit by a cataclysmic earthquake.
Campanis, then the general manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers, was asked by Ted Koppel on "Nightline" why so few blacks attained executive positions in baseball. He answered: 
 "I don't believe it's prejudice. I truly believe they may not have some of the necessities to be, let's say, a field manager or perhaps a general manager."
Campanis was eventually let go by the Dodgers, but his words made front-page news of the battle for increased hiring being waged by members of minority groups.
"Someone from in the inner circle had let out what we had known all along," said Frank Robinson, a Hall of Fame outfielder and the first black manager in the major leagues. "That attitude had been something we had been trying to tell people about, that these things were going on, that these thoughts existed. Now the rest of the world heard it from someone who made decisions to hire or not to hire."
More than five years later, however, minority hiring remains a complex and provocative issue, and executives in professional baseball, football and basketball are still measuring their progress in inches. Those waging the battle -- blacks, Hispanic people, Asians and whites -- are too often frustrated with systems and mindsets that still reflect the words of Campanis more than anyone who has tried to prove him wrong.
"Based on the records of the organizations, I don't think that we have been able to break through yet," said Robinson, now an assistant general manager with the Baltimore Orioles. "And I think that is evidenced by how many major league managers have been hired since Campanis and how few minorities have even been given a chance."
Executives in pro football, baseball and basketball all point to initiatives that have aided minority hiring, but the commissioners acknowledge frustration over their inability to guide individual clubs in their hiring practice. They also caution against having the issue slip behind other priorities and losing the urgency necessary to implement significant change.
Since Campanis, the 28 major league teams have hired 48 managers, only 6 of whom have been members of minority groups. Other numbers reflect both the gains and obstacles experienced by blacks trying to break through the door of limited opportunity:
*There are three black managers, the most ever, in the majors: Cito Gaston of Toronto, Felipe Alou of Montreal and Hal McRae of Kansas City. But the percentage of minority representation in all major league nonplayer, on-field jobs (including managers, coaches, trainers, scouts and instructors) was 19 percent at the end of the 1991 season, the same as the year before and down 1 percent from 1989, the peak year since such statistics started being compiled in 1988.
In the front office, members of minority groups accounted for 16 percent of employees in 1991, up from 2 percent in 1987. But the game has employed only one black general manager in its history, Bill Lucas of Atlanta in the late 1970's and among the 28 teams, there are now only 3 assistant general managers, including Robinson, who are black. Among players, 17 percent are black and 15 percent Hispanic.
*There are 66 black coaches -- head coaches or assistants -- on the 28 teams in the National Football League, up from 14 in 1980 and 44 in 1987. Still, in a league in which 60 percent of the players are black, there are only two black head coaches -- Art Shell of the Raiders and Dennis Green with the Vikings -- and three black coordinators, the position that is often a training ground for the top spot.
Over all, the number of minority-group members employed leaguewide, including coaches, front-office employees and league officials, increased from 182 in 1987 to 234 in 1991, increasing from 10 to 15 percent of the total.
*The National Basketball Association had been the only major sport with a black serving as managing general partner of a team -- Peter Bynoe of Denver -- until Bynoe sold his remaining share of the team last week. Four teams have black general managers. Of a total of 79 vice presidents league-wide, five are black.
Yet the league has come under increased scrutiny of late because it has actually seen a reverse trend at the head-coaching level. In 1987, the 23 teams then had four black coaches; but today, with four more teams, there are only two black coaches, and the last 13 coaches to be hired have all been white.
 
Commissioners And Unheeded Calls
 To many, such numbers represent more than slow progress. They represent a blatant refusal on the part of the clubs to heed the call of their own commissioners to improve employment practices.
"The numbers just aren't there," said Charles Grantham, executive director of the N.B.A. Players Association, "and it sends a very clear message to the active black player that if his intention is to continue in this business, there will be a different set of criteria in evaluating him for these positions."
The hiring issue has caught the attention of at least one member of Congress.
"I personally feel that Congressional oversight is necessary to strengthen the hand of the commissioners of the major sports leagues since the owners have historically been the drawback to progress," said Representative Donald M. Payne, a Democrat from Newark, who is black. Until such legislative action occurs, however, the bulk of the pressure must come from the commissioners, Robinson said. It has, to some degree, in all three sports. Members of minority groups make up 28 percent of the staff of the baseball commissioner, Fay Vincent, and blacks hold two of the eight cabinet-level positions: director of market development (Len Coleman) and director of minor-league relations (Jimmie Lee Solomon).
Vincent's record and efforts have been praised by even those who have been most critical of baseball's record: Bill White, the National League president, and the Orioles' Robinson.
That does not mean that blacks are without despair or complaint. "I think when Campanis spoke, the public outcry and the press attention made the National League do something," said White, the highest-ranking black in professional sports. "They made a statement by hiring me. But the pressure ebbs and flows, the public moves on to other things -- Roe v. Wade, Gore and Clinton, the Chicago Cubs injunction -- or whatever. After a while, all is forgotten."
In addressing the National Urban League conference in San Diego last month, Vincent said: "Here we are, 17 years after Frank Robinson became the first black manager in the major leagues, and today, in 1992, we have only three minority managers in the major leagues, only three black assistant general managers in the major leagues and not one black manager in the minor leagues. That is unacceptable."
The problem, Vincent concedes, is that a combination of other concerns -- tough economic times, the pending labor strife, turf warfare among owners -- has caused equal employment goals to fall far down the list of priorities of the clubs.
But Vincent points out that cannot be allowed to happen, not only because of the moral obligation, but also because of economic realities. "Although about 18 to 20 percent of the players are black, only 5 percent of the fans are black," Vincent said. "Now, in a world where nonwhite minorities are an increasing part of the American population, that means that baseball is selling itself primarily to a shrinking part of the market. To me, as a businessman, that's a losing proposition. And no one in baseball likes losing."
Thus baseball is striving to become more understanding of and involved in black society. Vincent recently announced the underwriting of a health care system for the approximately 135 surviving members of the Negro Leagues. And Major League Baseball is now the official sponsor of the National Urban League's annual youth conference, its $50,000 contribution underwriting the cost of the spinoff affair in San Diego.
Clifford Alexander, who runs a Washington-based consulting firm that heads up baseball's drive to improve its hiring methods, believes vigilance is absolutely necessary. He said: "What is the key is will baseball continue to seek to be better in this arena? The evidence that I have is that it will. Part of what we do is prod them. And we're going to continue to do that."
 
A Wake-Up Call To Join Battle
 David Cornwell was contemplating whether to accept a position with the N.F.L. when Campanis made his comments. A New York-based lawyer, Cornwell was being interviewed for a position as director of the league's equal opportunity program. He was leaning against making the move until Campanis spoke. "It was a wake-up call," said Cornwell. "I had a fire in my belly. My mandate? To make a difference."
Cornwell said one of his main concerns while working with the league was what he considered an institutional racist approach to hiring.
"You always used to see press releases that someone was looking for 'qualified' minorities -- as if that was the exception," said Cornwell, who worked for the N.F.L. until last March before leaving to join the sports agent Leigh Steinberg. "So I tried to get people like Pete Rozelle involved in fund-raising causes, internship programs, get them exposed to various aspects of minority life in different situations."
Unfortunately for members of minority groups, the clubs don't seem to be nearly as driven as commissioners in this area.
In baseball, over a dozen openings at the managerial level last year resulted in the hiring of one black manager and the interviewing of only two other black candidates, Don Baylor and Chris Chambliss. "You can make the numbers look any way you want, but the fact is that the commissioner has limited powers when it comes to making clubs look closer at their hiring," Baylor said.
Neither Frank Robinson nor either of the game's other two black assistant general managers were interviewed when a plethora of general-managing jobs also became available last year. Because so few black candidates are even interviewed for such jobs, blacks have had to find nontraditional routes to advancement. Reggie Williams, general manager of the New York/New Jersey Knights of the World League, illustrates this point.
Williams, a Dartmouth graduate and former Cincinnati Bengal as well as a onetime member of the Cincinnati City Council, wanted to continue his career in football in N.F.L. management. "But there were no ready opportunities in the N.F.L.," he said. "The Cincinnati Bengals have a policy that you have to learn elsewhere. They have no one in the front office who is a person of color." Williams did ask the Bengals to make an exception, to take a chance. "They graciously declined," he said.
The World League did not decline. And Williams is now running a professional franchise. Still, he cannot help wondering just how successful he could have been in the N.F.L. if he had not been swept away before he ever got a chance to get started.
Williams's problem points to the rough spots that the other sports still seek to smooth out when it comes to hiring. Payne, while stating that baseball still too often recycles white managers and overlooks black candidates, said that "the other pro sports, proportionately, do even worse."
Payne points to the Bengals' hiring of David Shula, who had recently been demoted as an assistant coach by the Dallas Cowboys. Shula was selected as head coach over Jim Anderson, a 43-year-old black assistant coach who directed Cincinnati's running game for eight seasons.
 
Rose-Colored Glasses at N.B.A.?
 The N.B.A. has traditionally been credited with better success in hiring blacks, but Alexander, a hiring consultant for major league baseball, believes much of it is the result of better public relations. "David Stern has been better and more capable of selling his league in this arena," Alexander said. "But I think there has been a lot of smoke and mirrors."
Alexander, who is black, makes that claim even though the N.B.A.'s population is 75 percent black and the league is made up of a core of extremely popular black athletes, perhaps the most popular team-sports stars in the country, if not the world.
Why the charge? "Because of the popularity of the players, people have gone from there to reach the improper conclusion that when it comes hiring in front offices you get a picture of full equity and it isn't there," Alexander said. "The N.B.A. has done a much poorer job of utilizing its source of supply than baseball."
An annual report by Northeastern University, compiled by Richard E. Lapchick of the university's Center for the Study of Sport in Society, also echoed those sentiments. "If the hiring trends in the N.B.A. continue through the 1992-93 season," Lapchick wrote, "there will be no 'shield of comfort' left for the N.B.A."
But, Lapchick added, "it is doubtful, based on his record, that Commissioner Stern will allow this to happen."
To Stern, the fact that the 13 most recently hired head coaches are white is no cause for hand wringing. "I don't think you can take a snapshot at a given time and make long-term judgments," he said. "If you look at the number of head coaches and assistant coaches and general managers and people in positions of leadership in the league, the lawyers, the accountants and others, there's been no backsliding at all."
Although the N.B.A. has no formal affirmative action policy, Stern believes it doesn't need one simply because its well-known role as an equal opportunity employer has been good for business by opening up "an extraordinary talent pool.
One of the league's five black general managers, Wayne Embry, the executive vice president of the Cleveland Cavaliers, does believe that there has been a regression in the drive for minority hiring, but he places the blame less with Stern or the individual owners than with the policy and guidance coming from Washington.
"Look at society," he said. "What we are in the N.B.A. reflects where the country has gone. I think there has been a general regression since the 1980's because of the political leadership."
By contrast, Embry, who became the N.B.A.'s first black general manager when he was chosen by the Milwaukee Bucks in 1972, had nothing but praise for Stern's commitment to equal opportunity.
"You've got to single out the N.B.A." he said. "It's been more aggressive in its hiring practices than the other leagues."
Stern, Vincent and Commissioner Paul Tagliabue of the N.F.L. know that the sport takes its biggest hits when it goes through a period like basketball just has, when the visible positions of manager and general manager open up in bunches, with very little positive results for blacks.
"Sure, that's what the public will always focus on, which is fair enough," said Steve Greenberg, Vincent's deputy commissioner. "We have at least identified a means to address the situation with managers. We have a three-to-five year focus on minor league hirings, to build a feeder system."
 
N.F.L.'s Low Grades But an 'E' for Effort
 The National Football League, is also frantically trying to find the magic key to doors that stubbornly remain closed. "You must set yourself some goals and then you must go out and look for people," Tagliabue said. "I found out people don't fall in your lap. I asked Vernon Jordan to put me in touch with black doctors. I got in touch with black judges."
Lapchick, in his report, has credited Tagliabue's administrative record, pointing to four hires of import within his office, including Harold Henderson, executive vice president for labor relations, and Leo Miles, a supervisor of officials. Still, while receiving kudos for effort, the N.F.L. receives just a C+ over all from Lapchick, and a D- in management hiring.
The solution to fixing the league's image and its problems certainly begins at the coaching level, many believe. That may also be the most difficult area to crack. For years, the league has cried that it gets its coaches from the college ranks, and that the top colleges don't produce minority coaches. Currently, there isn't one black coach in Division I-A. "If colleges would push harder, it would put more people in the pipeline," Tagliabue said.
The other pool often tapped for head coaches is the ranks of assistants, an area where blacks also often feel excluded. "It's a very fraternal thing," Bill Walsh, the former coach of the San Francisco 49ers and now coach at Stanford University, said in trying to describe the traditional mind-set of picking staffs. "You end up calling friends, and the typical coach hasn't been exposed to many black coaches."
The N.F.L., acknowledging flaws in its feeder systems, some years ago established a program to bring coaches from black colleges to training camps. But some of the traditionally black schools had their own troubles grooming black coaches.
The N.F.L. has since done away with that program and adopted a model created five years ago -- the year of Campanis -- by Walsh.
Walsh asked coaches to send him their academic background and a statement on goals if they wished to join his program and spend the entire preseason with the 49ers. "The first year I had a dozen applications," Walsh said. "By the end of the second year there were 50 responses."
Although unofficial in status, the concept worked. Both of the coaches who were picked from the Walsh program in 1987 found employment in the N.F.L. the next year. By 1988, half the N.F.L. teams had adopted Walsh's plan; now 26 of 28 have the program (the holdouts: the Giants and the Bengals).
It can also be said that the N.F.L. efforts may also be stymied by conservatism. The sport, treated in part like rocket science and religion, often requires of its applicants a dedication tantamount to signed loyalty oaths as well as proof of proper collegiate breeding that only a handful of schools can provide.
Work ethics, like necessities, will probably always be questioned in one form or another. Only when sports can guarantee that such questions are no longer attached to any particular race or ethnic group will the legacy of Al Campanis finally be allowed to die.

HEADLINE: NOTEBOOK;
Mets May Not Officially Be One of the Worst Bargains Ever, but It's Close

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
The August onslaught of physical mayhem committed against the Mets or by the Mets against themselves has shattered any thoughts that the disappointing team had of staging a last-lap sprint toward the National League East championship. It will also most likely prevent the Mets from finishing first in the salary standing and becoming only the second team to do that with a losing record.
Injuries to Bobby Bonilla, Howard Johnson, Bret Saberhagen, Dave Magadan and Willie Randolph in the first 12 days of this month forced the Mets to summon a platoon of players from the minor leagues, and their low salaries have reduced the team's average salary. 
 On opening day, the Mets had a 26-player payroll (including one player on the disabled list) of $44.5 million for an average of $1,711,615. The four roster moves they made on Friday left the Mets with a payroll of 33 players (8 on the disabled list) of $47.9 million for an average of $1,451,676.
The opening-day Mets average was No. 1 in the major leagues; the team's current average is third, behind Toronto's $1,576,970 and Boston's $1,465,853. The official 1992 average salaries will be based on players who are on rosters and the disabled list on Aug. 31.
With so much attention and considerable question focused on astronomical payrolls, a team could find it embarrassing, not to say devastating, to finish with the highest average salary and a record whose victories fall short of its losses.
The Blue Jays, barring radical roster changes, most likely will finish atop the salary standing. Their economic largesse should be rewarded with at least a division championship. But if Bonilla, Johnson and Saberhagen heal in time to be active again in two weeks, allowing the Mets to return three of their low-priced players to the minors, they could sneak to the top.
Then, assuming they don't win 30 of their last 48 games and finish over .500, the Mets could join the 1986 Atlanta Braves as the only teams to finish a season with the highest payroll and a losing record.
The Players Association began computing average team salaries in 1978. In 14 years, the Yankees have had the highest average eight times (including seven of the first eight), Oakland twice (the last two years) and the Braves, the Mets, Kansas City and California once each.
Five times the team with the No. 1 average salary finished first in its division. The salary leader has finished second three times, third twice, fourth twice and fifth once. All of those teams compiled winning records.
Then there were the '86 Braves.
Featuring such players as Dale Murphy, Bruce Sutter and Bob Horner, those Braves finished last with a 72-89 record and an average salary of $657,657.
A record average that lasted until the 1988 Yankees broke it, the figure was inflated by Murphy's $1,825,000, $1.8 million for Horner, $1,729,167 for Sutter, $1.5 million for Ken Griffey (known now but not then as Sr. because Jr. was still in high school), $1.37 million for Doyle Alexander and $1 million for Ted Simmons, who as the Pittsburgh Pirates' general manager wishes he could sign Barry Bonds for that salary.
Despite the lucrative pay, the Braves couldn't produce. Sutter epitomized the Braves' problems. Signed a year earlier to a six-year, $10 million contract, the relief pitcher had had off-season shoulder surgery, then encountered additional rotator-cuff problems early in the season and had to quit after making only 16 appearances in the first season in 10 years that he hadn't accumulated at least 20 saves. His career was virtually over.
During that season, the Braves were only a game and a half from first on July 3 with a 41-37 record, but over the rest of the season, they staggered to a 31-52 record and finished 23 1/2 games from the top.
Six years later, the lushly paid Mets are headed in the same direction.
 
Braves' Double Play?
 Tom Glavine, leading the majors with 18 victories, is in strong position to repeat as the winner of the Cy Young Award as the best pitcher in the National League. Terry Pendleton, his teammate with the Braves, is a legitimate contender for the most valuable player award, which he won last year. If they should both repeat, it would mark the first time in either league that the same players won the awards in two successive seasons.
In two instances, different players from the same team won the awards in successive seasons.
In 1962, Don Drysdale and Maury Wills of Los Angeles won the awards, and their teammate, Sandy Koufax, grabbed both awards the next season. Rollie Fingers of Milwaukee won both awards in 1981, and his teammates, Pete Vuckovich and Robin Yount, were winners the next year.
 
Marlins' Triple Play?
 If all of the reports are to be believed, the Florida Marlins will select an unprotected Danny Tartabull in the expansion draft, sign Andre Dawson as a free agent and get Jose Canseco in a trade.
All three sluggers have longtime Miami connections -- Tartabull and Dawson were born and raised there, Canseco grew up there -- and speculation has all three being available after the season.
It says that the Yankees will not place Tartabull on their 15-man protected list, gambling that the Marlins won't want to pick up his expensive contract; that the Cubs will let Dawson go as a free agent and that the Athletics will trade Canseco to get rid of his contract and his questionable attitude.
Carl Barger, the Marlins' president, laughed at the thought of acquiring all three stars. But he didn't say the Marlins would automatically shun high-priced players.
"A lot of what we do will depend on the options other teams give us," Barger said. "If they choose to leave their high-priced talent exposed, we could do some things that would surprise people. That's not our present intention. Our intention is to build with young players. But we're also not going to expand a team's 15-man protected list to 30. We're not going to send out a message that they can leave their high-priced players unprotected because we're not going to take them."
 
A Fielder Too Tall
 Gary Sheffield of San Diego woke up yesterday leading two-thirds of the Triple Crown categories. He was hitting .343, 6 points better than John Kruk of Philadelphia; he had 83 runs batted in, the same number as Darren Daulton of Philadelphia, and he had hit 25 home runs, two fewer than his teammate, Fred McGriff.
All three of his numbers might have been higher (.344, 86, 26) if Bip Roberts, Cincinnati's left fielder, hadn't been ejected from the game Friday night. Roberts was thrown out for arguing a play at first base, and minutes later, his rookie replacement, Cesar Hernandez, leaped at the left-field fence and, with his glove above the fence, snared what would have been a three-run home run. Hernandez is 6 feet tall. Roberts, five inches shorter, might not have reached the ball.
 
A Bridge Too Far
 If the Giants are permitted to move from San Francisco to St. Petersburg, Fla., the Oakland Athletics will have the Bay Area to themselves. They should benefit by gaining more lucrative television and radio contracts with the airwaves all to themselves -- negotiations are in progress for new contracts -- but contrary to popular view, they won't necessarily gain at the gate.
When the Giants and the Dodgers left New York 35 years ago, the Yankees did not benefit by having the fans of the departed teams flock to Yankee Stadium. In the seven years before the move, the Yankees averaged 1,581,687 a season; in the seven years following the move, they averaged 1,494,811. The Yankees won six pennants in each seven-season span.
For most Giants fans, crossing over to the east side of the bay to see a baseball game would be like Dodger fans traveling from Brooklyn to the Bronx in the late 1950's and early 60's. It didn't happen.
 
He's Only Human
 The Athletics, doing a remarkable job in overcoming various forms of adversity, experienced culture shock in the last week. In the space of five games, Dennis Eckersley squandered a save opportunity in one game and walked two batters in another.
Before he relinquished the lead to Kansas City, Eckersley had succeeded in holding leads 36 times in 36 save situations this season. Four days later, after having walked five batters in 55 1/3 innings over 47 games, Eckersley walked Lance Johnson and Joey Cora of the Chicago White Sox. He would plead guilty, but with an explanation. The walk to Johnson was intentional.
Discussing the Athletics' uncharacteristically mediocre pitching, General Manager Sandy Alderson said: "We've gotten very good pitching and lousy pitching for periods of time. When we're good, we're very good, and when we're lousy, we're very lousy." Then he added: "Eckersley has to make a huge difference. We win every game he pitches, and no one else can say that."

HEADLINE: When Doctors Say Yes and Insurers No

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA

 BODY:
A few months ago, Dr. Steven Nissen, a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, was called in to consult in the puzzling case of a 44-year-old woman. Her chest felt tight at times, but she did not have the pain that signals the clogged arteries of heart disease. Hospitalized several times for the discomfort, she was discharged each time when tests showed nothing wrong.
Then Dr. Nissen had an idea: a new, little-used test called intravascular ultrasound that would let him see inside the woman's arteries. Like something out of the film "Fantastic Voyage," the test involves threading through the blood vessels a catheter with the equivalent of a tiny movie camera at the tip. 
 "We put the probe in there," Dr. Nissen said, "and sure enough, there was soft cholesterol-laden plaque all up and down the artery," indicating serious clogging.
The other doctors in the room, who were about to send the woman home with no treatment, were shocked. They prescribed two powerful cholesterol-lowering drugs and a strict low-fat diet to try to induce the plaque to regress. The hope is to prevent a disabling or fatal heart attack, keep the woman at work and eliminate enormous hospital bills.
Intravascular ultrasound "could be the most important change in the way we evaluate patients with coronary disease in the last 30 years," said Dr. Jeffrey Isner, chief of cardiovascular research at St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Boston. Other cardiologists agree. They say it shows the inside of a patient's blood vessels with detail so fine, and images so pure, that the only thing comparable is to split open the blood vessels at autopsy and look at them.
But development and use of the new device has languished, doctors and manufacturers say, falling victim to the nation's struggle to control medical costs. The bill for each intravascular ultrasound is expected to be several thousand dollars. Insurance companies are beginning to refuse to pay for such expensive tests and treatments unless it can be proved with clinical data that they are more effective for a particular class of patient than are the existing methods. And their costs must be justified, by improvement in the patient and also sometimes by elimination of the need for other costly treatments.
 
Who Will Pay?
 The catch, cardiologists and manufacturers say, is that the only way to prove intravascular ultrasound is clinically and cost effective is to use it a lot. And the only way that will happen is if insurers pay for it.
Health care experts say that the story of intravascular ultrasound illustrates a growing obstacle to the development of medical technology. For years, the country has relied on health insurance to pay for the diffusion of new technologies that saved or improved lives and oh, by the way, turned a pretty profit for doctors, hospitals and medical-equipment manufacturers and the investors who financed them. When that source is cut off, there seems nowhere else to turn.
The problem, many experts say, is that in the name of cost containment Americans may be slowing progress toward medical advances -- even ones that might ultimately save on health costs by detecting disease at an early stage, curing it at a lower cost or preventing it.
"What you see here in this case, what's being complained about, is the beginnings of mechanisms of controlling a process that never was controlled," said Dr. Norman Daniels, a health care researcher at Tufts University. "In the past, you could always just go ahead and run with this ball as far as you could and see if it was worth carrying. And if it wasn't, so what? You could always get reimbursement."
Insurers say they are in a bind. Expensive technologies account for 40 percent of annual increases in health insurance premiums, said Dr. John Cova, director of medical technology assessment for the Health Insurance Association of America, which represents many insurance companies. "We have fewer and fewer health care dollars to spend each year and more and more to spend them on," he said. "We can no longer afford to support the diffusion of new technology through health care coverage."
Intravascular ultrasound is far from the only treatment running into resistance from insurers. (See box.)
Dr. Michael Strauss, the president of Health Technology Associates, a consulting firm in Washington, said the new insurance climate has a chilling effect on investors who finance small companies. "If it takes five, six or seven years to get payment, most companies can't hold out that long," he said. "We have retainer agreements with lots of venture capitalists, and about once a week we get a call asking what is the likelihood of payment" on a new method or device.
A 1991 survey of executives at medical-product and service companies found that 45 percent of those at companies with sales exceeding $51 million thought that the new resistance by insurers, which also includes bargaining down the price they pay for various treatments, was hurting their stock price and financing prospects. The figure rose to 81 percent at the smallest companies (sales under $5 million). A third of the company presidents in the survey, by the consulting firm Biomedical Business International of Santa Ana, Calif., said cuts in insurance coverage would reduce revenues by as much as 5 percent; almost half said the drop would be 6 percent to 25 percent.
Not too long ago, insurers routinely paid for devices and medical procedures that had Food and Drug Administration approval. And devices like that used for intravascular ultrasound are usually approved quite quickly by the F.D.A. Unlike drugs, for which manufacturers have to prove safety and efficacy, devices need only be substantially equivalent to other devices on the market.
 
Bring in the Experts
 But F.D.A. approval is "not enough anymore," Dr. Strauss said. The Health Insurance Association of America helps its members decide whether to pay for new technologies by convening panels of experts to discuss them. Dr. Cova said he brings together four or five advocates of a technology and four or five who challenge it. An expert deemed neutral leads the panel, and transcripts are sent to the 300 commercial insurers in the group. The medical director at each insurer then decides whether to recommend reimbursement.
Dr. Cova said the insurance association also passes its findings on to the Government for its own health programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. The Government assesses technology through the tiny Office of Health Technology Assessment. And like the private insurers, the Government has increasingly balked at paying for certain things.
The field of cardiology, in which the intravascular ultrasound is a potential player, illustrates the way medical technology, with all its benefits and costs, has proliferated. Thirty years ago, a patient with chest discomfort who went to the doctor would typically come away with nitroglycerin pills that temporarily relieve chest pain. The cost was usually minimal. Then again, a lot of patients later died of heart attacks.
In the 1960's came the wide use of angiography, in which a dye is injected into the arteries and an X-ray is taken, showing constrictions. The test, improved since then, costs insurers about $1,500, says the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association.
By the 1970's, surgeons were practicing coronary bypass surgery, in which blood is shunted around a blocked artery. Such surgery typically costs $40,000 today.
Now, diagnostic tests also include an echocardiogram, measuring heart movement, at about $450, and a scintillation test, measuring blood flow to the heart, at $400.
An intravascular ultrasound would cost insurers about $3,000 to $4,000, said Melissa Sabino, vice president of the Wilkerson Group, a New York health care consulting company. This includes about $2,000 to $3,000 for the hospital and about $1,000 for the cardiologist administering the 10-minute test. And that charge might come on top of the cost of the angiogram tried beforehand.
Such procedures have proved lucrative for the specialists who perform them; these doctors "have increased their income quite a bit recently," Ms. Sabino said, by doing more procedures and charging more.
In an intravascular ultrasound, doctors thread a thin catheter into the blood vessels. At the tip of the catheter is a minuscule device that bounces sound waves off the artery walls. A special ultrasound machine picks up the signals and produces detailed pictures.
The technique helps cardiologists determine whether the artery-clogging plaque is hard or soft. This allows doctors to more rationally consider a variety of options, including whether to do a bypass, to try to squash the plaque against the vessel wall by inflating a tiny balloon within the artery, or to try to vaporize the plaque with a laser.
In addition, cardiologists say, intravascular ultrasound allows them to learn, for the first time, whether a person has a uniform, and dangerous, buildup of plaque, as Dr. Nissen's patient did, or merely narrow blood vessels. Tests like angiography sometimes miss the plaque because they look for areas of artery constriction. The plaque buildup in Dr. Nissen's patient was so uniform, narrowing the artery so smoothly, that it appeared the artery was simply of slightly small bore.
Some patients who have undergone intravascular ultrasound in the few hospitals that offer it were spared bypass surgery, saving tens of thousands of dollars, when doctors learned that they were fine. Others, like the woman Dr. Nissen saw, had huge pile-ups of plaque, although some patients, like the woman, could not benefit from surgery because there was no specific constriction.
If intravascular ultrasound had come on the scene just a few years earlier, cardiologists say, it would have spread quickly. Now, with no insurance payments, just a few medical centers offer it. Only large medical centers, like the Cleveland Clinic and Duke University Medical School, are willing to absorb its costs, taking a loss or paying for it through research grants. A few places, like Tufts University, say they have found creative ways to slip in the cost, unnoticed, on insurance bills.
 
Companies Give Up
 The new resistance from insurers has left medical-equipment manufacturers dangling, said Steven Speil, director of payment and health care delivery at the Health Industry Manufacturers Association. "Payers say, 'Give us more information on what it can do.' But you can't generate more data absent reimbursement," he said. Mr. Speil said a growing number of companies are giving up on new technologies.
The medical-equipment industry offers great potential for profitability once a device gains wide use. Ms. Sabino said gross profit would typically be around 60 percent for machines like ultrasound devices, and about 80 percent for catheters.
The ultrasound machines that make intravascular images sell for $75,000 to $100,000. The catheters, which cannot be reused, sell for $400 to $800.
The ultrasound machines and catheters are being made mostly by small companies, including Intertherapy in Irvine, Calif., Endosonics in Pleasanton, Calif., and Cardiovascular Imaging Systems in Sunnyvale, Calif. But last month, Hewlett-Packard announced that it would start making the machines as well, teaming up with Boston Scientific, a Watertown, Mass., manufacturer of catheters.
Doctors say they are especially saddened by the slow development of intravascular ultrasound when they compare it with other technologies that gained a foothold because insurers paid for them. For example, balloon angioplasty, introduced in the early 1980's to clear arteries by inflating a tiny balloon, spread rapidly and is now more widely used than bypass surgery. Yet only now are clinical trials under way to see which provides better long-term results.
An expensive diagnostic method, magnetic resonance imaging, also slipped in under the old rules.
Dr. Cova said that if manufacturers are so set on intravascular ultrasound, they should "take some of the millions of dollars that they are spending on marketing and advertising and fund a neutral party that would assess that technology."
But Dr. Daniels of Tufts said that would not be so easy. It is hard enough, he said, to do a good cost assessment of an established technology, but nearly impossible to do one for an embryonic technology.
Another possibility is for doctors and manufacturers to jointly perform clinical trials that could show the intravascular ultrasound saves money by improving diagnoses.
But the studies would take years, and the handful of companies that make the special catheters and ultrasound machines are mostly small start-up companies, with limited cash to pay for clinical trials. In the past, trials were not done at all or they were done by the Government.
Dr. Isner of St. Elizabeth's said he and others like the intravascular ultrasound so much that they considered doing the studies themselves. But "it's not that easy," he said.
"Maybe," he said, "the fact that no one has gone to the trouble reflects our past experience that it is not necessary to go to that trouble. Maybe now we are living in an era where if we feel strongly enough about something like this, we have to do it."
 
TREATMENTS SPURNED
 Intravascular ultrasound is not the only medical treatment facing demands from insurers for more proof of effectiveness. All told, hundreds of products aimed at anywhere from 10,000 to a million patients have met resistance, said Peggy Pargoff, president of Biomedical Business International, a consulting firm in Santa Ana, Calif.
For example, devices called lithotripters, which are widely used to pulverize kidney stones, could not get insurance coverage for smashing gallstones because they were judged to be not as effective as techniques like removing the gall bladder.
Dr. John Cova, director of medical technology assessment for the Health Insurance Association of America, said that despite the enormous investment in positron emission tomography, the imaging technique known as a PET scan, most insurers won't pay for it. In a recent assessment by his organization, experts concluded that PET scans of the heart were not much better than conventional imaging yet "cost twice as much."
Dr. Cova said insurers are also denying payment for a type of gynecological surgery that employs two teams of surgeons and a laparoscope to do vaginal hysterectomies. "They don't have any data showing it's more effective and it costs four or five times as much."
In other cases, new techniques have slipped through the insurance net. A popular new method of gall bladder surgery, through a slit in the abdomen with a laparoscope, has been covered by insurers. Yet there were no clinical data on its effectiveness or on how it compared with traditional gall bladder surgery, said Dr. Michael Strauss, president of Health Technology Associates, a Washington consulting firm. The reason it is covered, he explained, is that doctors can bill for it as a gall bladder removal -- they did not need a new insurance code -- even though the procedure takes less time and should be less expensive.
 
IN SEARCH OF A COMPROMISE
 No one denies that health insurance companies have a legitimate complaint when they say they cannot go on paying for every new technology that lights up a doctor's eye. But some experts question the new demands by insurers that manufacturers prove the worth of their devices. They propose alternative solutions that, they say, would give promising new methods more of a fighting chance.
The Health Industry Manufacturers Association favors what it calls conditional coverage: the insurance industry would pay for limited use of a new technology in settings like selected medical centers where data on its effectiveness could be generated.
Such a system "would help us all," said Steven Speil, director of payment and health care delivery for the association. "It puts at least a temporary lid on the technology, so we don't have the consequences the insurers fear -- a technology out of control. And the manufacturers, the doctors and the clinics get paid."
The Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association has begun financing such studies for bone marrow transplants in breast-cancer patients.
Dr. Steven Nissen, a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, said he would like to see the Government pay for studies on the effectiveness of promising technologies and a national panel of experts to evaluate which ones merit reimbursement. If a new method passed this scrutiny, he said, its overuse should be prevented by requiring "certificates of need," issued by the Government, that would limit the number of centers at which the technology would be available.
Dr. Norman Daniels of Tufts University said more research must be done on how best to assess a technology. Now, he said, only a minimal effort is under way to develop better ways to determine how clinically and cost effective new medical methods are. Too often, he said, "it's just guesstimating." And that, experts said, can lead to capricious decisions that hobble methods that could save lives and dollars while letting fancy devices with no clear advantages into the marketplace.

CORRECTION-DATE: August 23, 1992, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about new medical technology and what insurers are willing to pay for it inaccurately described a billing practice at Tufts University. While other hospitals have found ways to be partly reimbursed for cardiovascular ultrasound, the main teaching hospital at Tufts, New England Medical Center, says it gets no such reimbursement.

AFTER THE WAR WAS OVER
Hanoi and Saigon.
By Neil Sheehan.
131 pp. New York:
Random House. $17. 
 IN 1989 Neil Sheehan, a former correspondent in Vietnam for United Press International and The New York Times, returned to the scenes of his youth, of his generation's war and of the reportage that became his life's work. "After the War Was Over" is the result of that journey. This political travelogue deals with the question that occurs so easily to all who visit Vietnam now, but that American leaders of the 1960's apparently could not begin to formulate: "Why in the name of God had we bombed a country as poor as this?"
The poverty, exacerbated by American bombing and now partly maintained by the postwar American economic embargo, is everywhere present in this work, from rat-infested hotel rooms to a filthy Hanoi hospital where the life of a child was lost for lack of an antibiotic readily available at American drugstores.
The Vietnamese Mr. Sheehan interviewed are presented as people as forgiving as they were fierce. As examples of dedication to the common good, they are sharply at odds with the current conception of "Communist" as a synonym for "corrupt."
The most interesting of them is Nguyen Van Linh, who in 1989 was the general secretary of the Vietnamese Communist Party. He is a man who survived 12 years in a French prison, 30 years of war and a decade of political infighting to push his country toward economic liberalization and away from the grayness imposed by his Stalinist comrades.
Mr. Linh, whose Communism is based more on "Les Miserables" than on "Das Kapital," achieved a degree of reform, he told Mr. Sheehan, by applying the lessons learned in the jungle fighting Americans. "My comrades and I could not afford to be subjective in our conclusions," he said. "Had we been subjective, we would immediately have been crushed by reality. So I continued to think according to that pattern when I shifted to peaceful restructuring." Mr. Sheehan contrasts this with the illusions on which John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson based their war policy, primarily the belief that Ho Chi Minh and his associates, heirs to a thousand-year tradition of anti-Chinese nationalism, were pawns of the Chinese.
"After the War Was Over" serves as an afterword to the author's Pulitzer Prize-winning "Bright Shining Lie" and will probably be most appreciated by readers of that book. Mr. Sheehan revisits the battlegrounds of the war and finds them filled with optimistic people, along with the "American grass" that the Vietnamese believe was deliberately seeded by the United States to provide a combustible material for additional waves of napalm.
To his surprise, Mr. Sheehan discovers an absence of animosity toward the United States. In a country now finally, truly undergoing Vietnamization, buildings are kept in readiness for the return of American officials.
As a Hanoi doctor said of the 19th-century microscope still used at his hospital, "After the War Was Over" helps us "see a little better than with our eyes."
 
 
 
WAITING FOR THE RATS
 "The Hotel Metropole . . . was 'le dernier salon ou l'on cause,' the last really fashionable place in Hanoi," [Bernard] Fall had written of his Hanoi of the 1950's. . . . When I walked up the front steps . . . past Grecian columns of peeling white paint, and pushed on the revolving door at the entrance, it turned grudgingly. The explanation was not in the heaviness of the once-handsome door: almost everything in Hanoi has been running down since 1939. The spindle on which the revolving door turned was worn out. Decades of guests coming and going, grinding grit underfoot, had also created dips in the marble of the entrance steps and the floor of the lobby. We went up to the room assigned to us on the third floor. It was large and held two old wooden beds with mosquito netting. . . . Because I had stayed in rooms like it elsewhere in Asia during my young reportorial years, I could almost see the rats, even though I knew they probably would not come out until after dark. (An Australian friend stayed at the [Metropole] with his son and daughter while we were in Hanoi. His son lost a large part of a sock to the rats one night, and his daughter was afraid to get out of bed to take a bath because the rats made so much noise gamboling about the room.) -- From "After the War Was Over."

HEADLINE: Office Space Still Plentiful Despite Bright Signs

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

 BODY:
WHEN the subject is office space, the good news locally is that many small and medium-size companies are leaving Manhattan and relocating their operations in Westchester. But the bad news is that the flurry of activity is not strong enough to turn the market around.
"Bluntly put, there is still a tremendous amount of office space to be absorbed before it will be fair to say that the county has turned the corner," said John Rostenberg, president of the Rostenberg-Doern Company, a commercial brokerage with offices in Purchase and Stamford. 
 "Prospects look slim for a rebound of the office market this year," he said. "One of the reasons for that prognosis is that the Westchester market is closely tied to the activity of the mid-Manhattan market. And right now, the difference in rental rates between mid-Manhattan and Westchester have narrowed, making us less competitive. The large company move-outs that landlords in the county were hoping for are not occurring. The large companies are staying right where they are, in Manhattan."
In order to attract prime tenants from New York City to Westchester for Class A space, Mr. Rostenberg said, a margin of about $10 a square foot for space is needed.
 
A Record Vacancy Rate
 "Although 100,000 square feet of Class A space in Westchester can now be had for under $20 a foot, compared with $30 a foot five years ago, Class A space in New York City has dropped to $25 a foot, which makes it not as attractive to move to Westchester as it was when the spread was significantly greater," he said.
A just-released report from Mr. Rostenberg's office found that corporate consolidation and new vacancies continued to hamper recovery for the Westchester office market during the first half of the year. The countywide vacancy rate of 21.9 percent at the end of June was up from 18.5 percent in 1991. Hardest hit was downtown White Plains, with a record vacancy rate of 27 percent.
Major changes, namely the American Telephone and Telegraph Company's vacating 180,000 square feet of space and a consolidation by Prodigy Services, has left the downtown area with 387,000 square feet vacant. The failure of the Dollar Dry Dock Bank also returned a sizable block of space to the market.
 
Some Positive Notes
 But Prodigy's recent announcement that it had signed a renewal lease for 340,000 square feet, the entire building at 445 Hamilton Avenue, is an encouraging sign for the downtown market.
"Also on the positive side, 10 Bank Street, a building with easy access to the train station, is doing well," Mr. Rostenberg said. "Right now, 10 Bank Street is the most active building in Westchester."
That building is a 12-story, 219,000-square-foot granite and glass structure, built in 1990 and owned by Homart Development Company of Chicago, part of the Sears Roebuck group of companies.
R. Perry Neilson Jr., the development director for Homart, said plans for the building, which is Homart's first project in the Northeast, were developed during the boom years of the late 1980's.
"We were then correctly responding to the forces of supply and demand," Mr. Neilson said. "In our surveys we showed that downtown White Plains had the lowest vacancy rate in the country at that time. But by December 1989, when the building came onstream and our first and largest tenants, the Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, moved in, the recession was already on us."
Mr. Neilson said Homart decided on a marketing plan, going after the Manhattan market. By implementing an aggressive advertising and marketing campaign, which included posters in commuter train cars and ads in Metro-North schedules, the building attracted attention from prospective tenants.
 
Transplanted Tenants
 "We stressed the quality of the building and its proximity to Manhattan, which is only a 3-minute walk to the station and a 34-minute commute," Mr. Neilson said.
Just how successful were their efforts? More than half of the 23 tenants are transplants from Manhattan, Mr. Neilson said.
"We have lawyers who want to be near the courthouse and Manhattan at the same time," Mr. Neilson said. "We have small companies whose owners live in Westchester and like the ease of commuting by car. And we have a good mix of small- to medium-size businesses that come from Manhattan, including trucking companies and security firms."
The tenants get inducements like improvement allowances and rental concessions, "but I believe the big selling point in the 90's will be service," Mr. Neilson said. "A key element in renting space today is running harder than the competition to provide such things as 24-hour security, a resident manager who is an on-the-spot trouble-shooter and making sure that the computerized buildings we have today run efficiently."
Thirty-five percent, or 75,000 square feet, at 10 Bank Street is still vacant.
 
Concessions Being Offered
 At Cushman & Wakefield, the region's largest commercial brokerage, William E. Hartman, the associate who handles Westchester transactions, said: "Although the first three months of the year were especially tough with numerous properties, namely the Schulman Realty Group's buildings taken over by lenders, in the long run, changes in ownership will be beneficial to tenants. Because the new owners are financially stable, they have the wherewithal to make a long-term commitment to the market."
He gave as an example Gateway Towers, the 560,000-square-foot building in downtown White Plains, built by James Pappas and now owned by the Cigna Corporation of Hartford.
"When former lenders like Cigna become owners they can be more responsive to the market," Mr. Hartman said. "The new owners of the 22 properties that formerly belonged to the Schulman Realty Group also have the resources now to make concessions to tenants."
Both Mr. Hartman and Carl Austin, head of Austin Corporate Properties in Tarrytown, said the glut of office space and the decline in rents has a silver lining.
"This is the time to lock in 10-year leases because we're at the bottom of the market now," Mr. Hartman said. "Tenants who hold leases written in 1986 and '87 are paying over $30 a foot for space that can now be negotiated for $19 to $20 a foot. And there is nothing on line because there is no new construction going on in the county at present."
 
A Chance to Move Up
 Mr. Austin added: "It's a market of opportunity for tenants who are eager to step up from Class B space to Class A space. The climate is right for companies who want to relocate outside of New York City."
The county's largest lease so far this year, the 78,000 square feet taken by J.W.P. Inc. in the Royal Executive Park in Rye Brook, has helped reduce available space in the eastern part of the county, Mr. Austin said.
He added that H. Hoenig & Company, a brokerage firm, recently transferred an entire office from Third Avenue in midtown Manhattan to Royal Executive Park.
In other Westchester markets, the Route 119 corridor saw the vacancy rate fall slightly from six months ago. Although International Business Machines made a major recommitment with renewal and expansion at the Tarrytown Corporate Center, American Ultramar vacated about 50,000 square feet of subleased space in the Christiania Building, Mr. Rostenberg said.
In southern Westchester, there was little significant leasing during the first six months of the year. The vacancy rate was 15.3 percent, up slightly from 14.2 percent the previous year.
In the northern Westchester office market, which includes Mount Pleasant and Mount Kisco, more than 86,000 square feet was absorbed during the first half of the year. The vacancy rate in that market fell from 25.6 percent six months ago to 23.3 percent at the end of June.

HEADLINE: Burden of Commuter Smog Falls on Employers

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
CONNECTICUT employers must now start thinking about how their employees get to work, as much as how hard they work. This is because an updated and revised version of a 1970 Federal law, whose provisions are being phased in throughout this decade, makes large companies in areas as polluted as Connecticut responsible for curbing the pollution associated with commuting.
A draft plan prepared by the state Department of Transportation calls for large employers to consider such measures as sharing the cost of van-pooling and mass transit with commuters, providing preferential parking for car poolers and permitting flexible work hours to encourage car pooling. Although there has been much criticism of Federal delays in developing regulations needed to meet the goals of the new legislation known as the Clean Air Act of 1990, the Transportation Department, trade groups and planning agencies are joining together to help companies prepare to meet the letter of the law. 
 "This could really change business, because it makes them responsible for something that we've always taken for granted as being a personal decision -- how we get to work," said William H. Messner, a planning director for the Transportation Department. "It could even result in significant social changes, if employers adopt things like four-day work weeks and telecommuting to reduce pollution."
Under the original Clean Air Act adopted in 1970, only so-called smokestack industries were held accountable for pollution. But air experts estimate that 70 percent of the smog in Connecticut comes from automobile tailpipes. So, in areas like Fairfield County, classified as severely polluted, any company with more than 100 employees will have to develop a policy to reduce the number of commuter trips. .
"Companies that have never had to think about the Clean Air Act before, now they're going to have to start paying attention," said Joseph M. Ercolano, vice president of the Southwestern Area Commerce and Industry Association. Under the new law, compliance is based on commuting, he said, "and every business has commuters."
 
More Comprehensive Than Old Act
 Although the Federal act affects only large businesses, it could change the way all commuters think, said Liz E. Navarro, director of sales for Metro Pool, a transportation management company based in Stamford.
"We want to say, 'You, Mr. Corporation, you fix this problem,' but what can happen is the corporations become trendsetters, and things will get done," Ms. Navarro said. "It does spread, and that is, of course, what it's meant to do."
The revised Clean Air Act, signed into law Nov. 15, 1990, is far more comprehensive than its predecessor, and the impact on commuting is one way it is expected to make itself felt in Connecticut. The act seeks to reduce toxic emissions into the air by as much as 90 percent.
The 1990 legislation is almost 800 pages long, compared with 65 pages for the 1970 version. It regulates 189 chemicals, up from 7, and where the 1970 act regulated any company putting more than 100 tons of pollutants into the air each year, the 1990 act governs a company emitting 25 tons, or 10 tons of any one pollutant. In 1970, violations of the act were misdemeanors; the 1990 legislation makes many violations felonies, with fines as high as $1 million.
The legislation puts new restrictions on chemicals that cause acid rain, that damage the protective ozone layer or that create smog. Industry estimates it will cost the nation's businesses $51 billion a year to comply with the 1990 provisions. Government analysts put the cost lower, at $25 billion to $35 billion.
But advocates say there could still be a net savings. The American Lung Association estimates that there will be 1,750 to 3,000 fewer deaths each year from pollution if the air is clean and that health care costs will decrease $40 billion to $50 billion a year. Damage to buildings will diminish, and the productivity of farm and forest land should be enhanced as acid rain is brought under control. The expanded Clean Air Act could even spur the creation of a new environmental engineering industry and prop up the price of corn if farmers use it to make alcohol, a cleaner-burning fuel than gasoline.
 
Deadlines for State Improvement
 The state was divided into two areas for the purposes of the act. Fairfield County is classified as "severely polluted," which means it will be under tighter restrictions than the rest of the state, which is classified as "seriously polluted." Air quality in Fairfield County must be improved to healthy levels by the year 2007; in the rest of the state, by 1999.
Joseph A. Belanger, the state Department of Environmental Protection director of planning for implementing the Clean Air Act, said people might be surprised at some of the measures that would go into effect to meet those goals.
Lawn mowers might have to be controlled because they contribute as much as 5 percent of the hydrocarbons that cause smog. Power boats, and even back yard barbecues, might have to be regulated.
 
'A Regional Problem'
 Mr. Belanger said the state's rules, in many instances, went beyond what was required at the Federal level. For instance, the Federal Environmental Protection Agency will require that only cleaner burning gasoline be sold in Fairfield and Hartford Counties by 1996. Connecticut extends that requirement to include the entire state.
"We're sort of out in front in this area, and we hope the Federal government adopts our position as it develops its own regulations," Mr. Belanger said. "Pollution is a regional problem, and it will do Connecticut no good to have rigorous policies if neighboring states don't."
Some business groups think provisions of the Federal legislation go too far, and could strangle economic development. Because of restrictions in seriously or severely polluted areas -- which covers the entire state -- companies now must go through an extensive review for permits to put in new or expanded operations. In order to receive a permit to emit chemicals at one site, a business will have to reduce pollution at other plants, or "buy" pollution credits from plants that are reducing pollution, said Richard A. Miller, a staff attorney for the Connecticut Business and Industry Association.
 
U.S. Rejects Petition
 The state argued that eastern Connecticut, which has cleaner air, should be classified only as moderately polluted, which would have allowed some economic development to take place without meeting the strict new pollution control requirements, Mr. Miller said. The Federal government rejected the petition.
The designation, Mr. Miller said, "wasn't necessarily based on science as much as it was based on a feeling there should be uniformity in such a small state. I think the Clean Air Act went a little too far in that it didn't look at some of these issues completely fairly."
In Fairfield County to obtain a permit to emit 100 tons of material a year, a company would have to cut back 130 tons somewhere else; in the rest of the state, by 120 tons.
"That's going to cause a real backlog at D.E.P., and that may mean some businesses will go to a state where they can get a permit faster and be up and running sooner," Mr. Miller said.
 
Enforcement Challenged
 Environmentalists, however, take the opposite view. Michael Stern, a staff attorney for the Connecticut Fund for the Environment, said he was particularly concerned about the pollutant that was of greatest concern in Connecticut: smog, or ozone.
"I think it could have been stricter about ozone," Mr. Stern said. The act sets up regional ozone transport commissions that will review each state's progress in meeting reduction efforts. If one state is not meeting goals, the other states report the violation to the Environmental Protection Agency. Mr. Stern asserted that the commissions should have had the power to take action themselves.
"Every one of these steps you add allows someone to put more political pressure on the process," he said.
In addition, he said, while the Clean Air Act sets many new requirements for business, it affords a liberal timetable -- businesses do not have to show any results for two to four years -- and there are no penalties for businesses that do not meet their goals. They simply have to submit a new commuter trip reduction plan.
"The act is real short on enforcement in many respects," Mr. Stern said.
Mr. Messner of the Transportation Department said it was a balancing act. "You don't want to make employers in Connecticut non-competitive because the burden is too onerous, and you don't want to compromise your health standards," he said.
 
Timetables Required
 The most widely felt impact of the legislation, however, will be on commuting. The state Department of Economic Development estimates there are 2,200 businesses in Connecticut with more than 100 employees, with more than 25 percent of them in 7 of the state's 169 towns: Hartford (156); Stamford (109); Bridgeport (88); New Haven (85); Waterbury (77); Danbury (60), and Norwalk (59).
The Transportation Department has a draft known as the State Implementation Plan for the Clean Air Act, with a final copy scheduled to be ready by Nov. 1, Mr. Messner said. Early next year large companies will get copies of the plan, and a timetable for submitting their own programs to increase average vehicle occupancy to at least 25 percent over the area's average.
Transit planners hope that as the provisions of the law go into effect over the next couple of years, more people will be encouraged to take advantage of systems that are already in place. Bea Friedman, a spokeswoman for Metro Pool, said her company's new shuttle system in Greenwich ran between the trains and major employers, with a capacity of more than 300 people, but is used by only about 60 people each day.
"We'd like to be able to say before long that we have 200 riders," Ms. Friedman said. "And I think that can be achieved, but we have to get the employers behind it."
 
Uncrowded Shuttle
 Peter S. Smichenko, a property manager for Hines Interests Ltd., which operates a 225,000-square-foot office complex on High Ridge Road in Stamford, said a shuttle to the railroad station was offered to tenants. Although only 15 or 20 people use it each day, of the 500 people working at the complex, he said he expected use to climb as employers came under the pressure of the Clean Air Act.
"Even now, it's a very important service to the people who use it," Mr. Smichenko said. "It's their only way to get to work."
Ms. Navarra, of Metro Pool, said many businesses knew what would be required of them under the Clean Air Act, but they also knew they had some time to comply.
"There will be some companies, probably a lot of companies, that will wait until the last minute," Ms. Navarra said. "We need to remind people that this is coming, that it has to be done, so start now."

HEADLINE: George Bush, Prisoner of the Crazies

BYLINE: By Garry Wills; Garry Wills, adjunct professor of history at Northwestern University, is author, most recently, of "Lincoln at Gettysburg."

DATELINE: EVANSTON, Ill.

 BODY:
St. Augustine, when he decided to dragoon reluctant people into the Christian camp, used a scriptural tag taken from the parable about the man whose guests did not come to his wedding feast: Coge intrare -- "Force them to come in" (Luke 14.23). The Republicans have called a love fest in Houston, to which some are loath to come. Their motto seems to be: Obsecra ut intrent -- "Beg them to come in."
People who have defied the President, called him weak or traitorous -- even branded him a tool of Satan -- are now being cajoled, asked not only to attend but to speak from the party's podium of honor. The platform committee renounces as "recessionary" the President's tax rise. A President in a strong position would not let his own party indirectly censure him. He certainly would not let minor Republican figures criticize him with impunity. But what is George Bush to do? He cannot ban people from a feast that so many do not want to attend in any case. 
 A third of the Republicans in Congress have announced their intention not to be in Houston. Republican candidates around the country are staying home to conduct their own campaigns. George Bush, who seems to attract hard luck these days, is being given a wide berth by people uneasy about their own elections. The President is reduced to papering the house, even if he has to do it with those who have ridiculed or humiliated him. Many of these critics come from the right wing of Mr. Bush's party, the hard core he needs most now and is servicing most strenuously.
Pat Buchanan began this year challenging the President's manhood -- the kind of attack Mr. Bush deeply resents. Mr. Buchanan said the President was afraid to debate him, that he could run but he could not hide, that he was unable to defend his vacillating record. That would be enough, with most partisans, to consign Mr. Buchanan to official oblivion.
Consider the other party's attitude to a member who challenged its candidate. Asked if Hamilton Jordan could return to the Democratic fold, James Carville, Bill Clinton's campaign manager, answered that he would not succor Mr. Jordan even if his heart were on fire and it could be doused by the simplest of irrigations.
But clearly the most astounding speaker in Houston is Pat Robertson. Mr. Robertson published a book this year ("The New World Order") arguing that the President's gulf war, his proudest achievement, was part of a diabolic plot to destroy America. By submitting to the U.N. and calling the world to its banner, President Bush was proclaiming the New World Order of the Antichrist. Near the original site of Babylon, the United Nations was raising a new Tower of Babel to challenge God's supremacy.
Mr. Bush thus completed a series of actions by organizations he has belonged to -- the Council on Foreign Relations, the Trilateral Commission, the C.I.A. -- pawns of the devil, all of them. Yet the President's party must now give this nuttiness a forum, as if Mr. Bush were crying: "Hit me again! Hit me again!" If the President will not defend his New World Order, what will he stand by?
This is not the first time the Republicans have cowered before their own right wing at convention time; but nothing like so large a set of concessions has been extracted before this.
In 1976, Gerald Ford caved in to the right wing's denunciation of detente by hiding Henry Kissinger through most of the convention and letting language critical of the Administration's foreign policy slip into the platform. John Sears was using these pressure points to promote a challenge from Ronald Reagan. Mr. Ford had to yield because there was some threat remaining of a stampede toward another candidate.
But President Bush is unchallenged, now, for the nomination, and he still grovels. He has not one official whose role he must play down or apologize for, but many. Richard Darman is denounced for the economic plan he foisted on the President, and Nicholas Brady for carrying out that plan. William Reilly, the E.P.A. Administrator, is denounced for protecting the environment at the cost of business immunities promoted by Vice President Dan Quayle. Robert Mosbacher is denounced for conferring with gays. Even Jim Baker, called in as a savior, is a dreaded "moderate" to the right, the marshaler of forces to the New World Order in the gulf.
In the past, the so-called social issues, which are really moral and religious issues, could be treated as secondary by Republican campaign managers, since the economy was the main concern of the party -- an economy called bad under Democrats in 1980, considered good under Republicans in 1984 and 1988.
That issue has crumbled beneath this President. The deficit is the Republicans' baby, nurtured to its present size by Reaganomics. All the promises of "supply side" policy -- increased saving and investment, reduced debts, new jobs -- sound empty.
This leaves Mr. Bush more than ever dependent on people who will oppose abortion, support school prayer and denounce homosexuals, no matter what happens to the economy. The President felt the ire of these people when he not only signed into law the "hate crimes" bill but invited gay activists to the signing. The Southern Baptist Convention retaliated by disinviting him from a speech he had been scheduled to give that body.
Mr. Bush has been actively courting this constituency ever since -- by, for instance, not only maintaining but strengthening his opposition to abortion, as one can see from the Administration's work for the "gag rule" against abortion counseling at federally supported clinics.
The man in charge of that policy is William R. Archer 3d of the Health and Human Services Department, a man who not only criticized the Roe v. Wade decision on abortion but the Griswold decision on the sale of contraceptives. Mr. Archer, a self-proclaimed celibate, is such an advocate of abstinence as the best way of controlling AIDS, teen pregnancy, and abortion that he told a clinic worker he regretted his own indulgence in sex six years earlier.
The crazies are in charge. The fringe has taken over. The social issues were a source of strength to the Republicans when they seemed to be supporting the mainstream moral concerns of most Americans. These Americans believe in God, prayer and the Bible, and they are uncomfortable with those who oppose any or all of those things -- as Democrats, absurdly, seemed to be doing in 1988.
But these morally concerned Americans do not want the AIDS menace to go unchecked while Pat Buchanan calls it the homosexuals' punishment, while Republicans oppose safety measures like the distribution of condoms and clean needles. These are not people who read the Book of Revelation as condemning the New World Order. They are not wild-eyed figures from the fringe that Mr. Bush is now reduced to courting. No wonder the Republicans must beg people to come into their shrinking tent. The fringe on that tent's entrance is forbidding, and the tent is becoming mainly fringe.

HEADLINE: CULTURAL VIEW;
Inside the Political Mimic's Fun-House Mirror

BYLINE: By Anna Deavere Smith; Anna Deavere Smith will appear this afternoon in a final performance at the Joseph Papp Public Theater of her one-woman show, "Fires in the Mirror," in which she plays 27 people she interviewed about the 1991 Crown Heights racial violence in Brooklyn.

 BODY:
To the artist, what is more dangerous: the possibility of giving offense or the refusal to look and to see? When the rest of us have turned our attention to other matters, the impressionists, the parodists, the comics, are still watching. Historically, their vigilance is what has kept them on the outskirts of society.
In our own time, Dana Carvey's impressions of President Bush on "Saturday Night Live" won him an invitation to the White House. On another occasion the President's speechwriters asked Mr. Carvey to talk to them about the President's mannerisms. 
 A videotape of the comedian Jim Morris performing Bush impersonations at the Ford Theater in Washington is intercut with shots of the President and his wife in the audience obviously enjoying the joke.
Authority likes to see itself imitated, followed. But impersonation is not the same as a mirror image or a videotape. For the health of a society, it should not be; it should, in fact, be authority turned upside down. Mimics study authority while standing on their hands. They wear respectable clothing -- designer jeans in their real lives and business suits while portraying politicians. But underneath is the spirit of Harlequin and his multicolors and a view of the world that is inverted. The public takes this reflection and uses it as a key. The mimic has opened up a new way of seeing.
In Shakespeare's "King Lear," the Fool is referred to by Goneril, the King's daughter, as his "all licensed Fool." The character can say things that would send others to prison or their graves. The Fool also serves as a mirror of Lear. Will the King recognize himself, the play asks. Every fool's mirror throws back a fun-house reflection that in some ways is truer than the more flattering real mirror image would be.
"I'm not concerned about politics for the good reasons," said the "Saturday Night Live" writer and performer Al Franken in a recent conversation. "I'm interested for the bad reasons. I'm interested for the horse race. It's fun to watch these people savage each other and lie."
In this society, comedians don't get executed for their political commentary, but a comic can't go where the audience is not willing to follow. Joy Behar remembers that when she performed Reagan jokes in the 80's, nobody laughed. "Even in New York, the Reagan material was not working. People were still making money and they didn't like seeing him trashed. Then it became clear unemployment was rising and it opened up."
"You couldn't get a joke off of Bush when he was Vice President because he had been the head of the C.I.A.," Ms. Behar said. "Today, Quayle has been a boon to comedy."
Which Presidential candidate is more lampoonable? "Clinton is younger," she said. "You can take more shots at a younger person."
When Comedy Central, the cable network, covered the Democratic National Convention last month in New York, what fascinated was the degree to which real politicians were cajoled into participating in their "foolishness." As Ms. Behar, Mr. Franken and other comics worked the convention floor, interviewing candidates and delegates on "Indecision '92," one wondered what encourages politicians to speak with fools. Might it be that some of these office-holders see the limit of the real glass mirror; see it and seek the notion of a human mirror, even if deflation comes with the bargain. When jesters sat at the side of kings, a relationship of interdependence developed with the two often meeting in the hallway of distorted mirrors. The mingling of politicians with select fools today may be a sign that a more fluid relationship between the two is being sought.
But it may also mean that this is a time for outsiders, said Mary Salter, vice president of current programs and production for the Comedy Central network. "With the rise of Perot, you saw that the country was open for something from the outside. People are looking for alternatives."
About the Republican National Convention, which opens tomorrow in Houston, Ms. Salter said her team is optimistic, convinced that the delegates want to be perceived as having senses of humor.
Although some comics are licensed fools, particularly those who have the sanction of celebrity, other social commentators, the rap artists, have clearly not been "all licensed." Perhaps they never set out to be. And it's doubtful that any of them are eager to cavort with the king. But they are eager to challenge the king. Their words are listened to. No physical shtick, no MTV cinematography keeps the word from coming through loud and clear. And, as has been seen this summer in the cases of Sister Souljah and Ice-T, the words have been taken seriously. To some they are cutting and on the money, to others, fearsome and divisive.
"Race is a tricky one," Ms. Salter said. "The whole point is it should be talked about. And we should talk about it, because when you can laugh about something together, you can talk about it."
So what is more dangerous: the possibility of giving offense or the refusal to look and to see? Eddie Murphy has done an impression of Jesse Jackson in which the mimicry is technically brilliant. As Mr. Jackson, he stops speaking and continues his thought in a soul tune with a three-man backup group. Would a white comic get away with combining these two motifs -- a powerful black political figure and Motown? Or would this be considered racial stereotyping? Would some consider Mr. Murphy himself to have crossed over the line of what is acceptable? Or is it rather that parts of our society are considered sacred until the fool shows us the upside-down view?
What if the President had an impressionist on staff who held him accountable? The political figure performs himself or herself every day, and that performance grows and changes like actors' performances grow and change the more they learn about the text, the circumstances and the audience.
If there were a house mimic -- an all-licensed Fool for 1992 -- would the individual necessarily be of the same race, gender and political sensibility as the President? Could that even be, if the person were meant, as the Roman satirists were, to keep the emperor in check?
Who would be the perfect Fool for our time? A time in which we are divided, challenged, in some quarters hushed, in others licensed. Who could speak to all our fragments, for all our fragments, while revealing to those in power their own denials, without the risk of metaphoric execution? Before we even answer that question we must ask: Does our society breed the kinds of fools who take the risks to show us more than we can see?

HEADLINE: PARTY IN THE SPOTLIGHT: THE OVERVIEW;
Fractured G.O.P. Meets as Public Voices Disfavor

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Aug. 16

 BODY:
Battered by political events and months of disorganization in President Bush's re-election drive, Republicans assembled here today for their national convention in a mood of striking uncertainty for a party that has held the White House for the last 12 years.
The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll outlines the daunting task of political rehabilitation that faces them. Gov. Bill Clinton, the Democratic nominee, retains a 17-point lead over Mr. Bush. Perhaps more important, the vast majority of American voters said there needed to be "real change" in the way things are going in this country, according to this survey.
 
Candidate for Change
 Only 15 percent said that re-electing Mr. Bush would bring that change, compared with 63 percent who saw that possibility under a Clinton Presidency. 
 Mr. Bush's strategists acknowledge that, whatever the reason, they have failed to convince the American people that the President has a plan and a vision to mend the economy; only 23 percent of the voters in the Times/CBS News Poll said he had offered specific ideas to reverse the downturn, while 48 percent said Mr. Clinton did. "That's what we're going to start curing here this week," said Charles Black, a senior adviser to the Bush campaign, underscoring the stakes of the next four days.
The nationwide telephone poll of 1,022 registered voters was conducted Tuesday through Friday and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
 
'I Know It, I Feel It'
 The campaign sent Mr. Bush forth this weekend on an extraordinary media blitz: from Time and Newsweek to the ABC News program "This Week." He confessed error, notably on breaking his "no new taxes" pledge. He blamed Congress for blocking his domestic programs. And, clearly trying to soften the impact of months of Democratic attacks, he told the American people that he understood their "hurting."
"I know it, I feel it, we pray about it," he told David Brinkley.
Mr. Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle are expected to arrive here on Monday, the opening day of the convention at the Houston Astrodome, but Mr. Bush set a feisty tone when he spoke by satellite hookup this afternoon to a group of supporters there. "Together, we really are going to close the gap," the President said. "We've got a good program; the people do not know it. And when we get through with this convention you've worked so hard for, they will."
Within his Administration and the party at large, the debate continued over what new economic measures the President should embrace, and when. Republicans presented the case both for and against new tax cuts on the Sunday talk shows, while others predicted a simple re-packaging of existing Administration proposals.
The abortion issue also continued to roil the party, with a billboard supporting abortion rights at the entrance to the convention center telling all who passed that 71 percent of Republicans support their cause. The Republican national chairman, Richard N. Bond, in an appearance this morning on the NBC News program "Meet the Press," tried to signal tolerance for differing views even as he defended the anti-abortion stance of the President and the party's new platform.
 
Jittery Convention
 "I don't think," Mr. Bond said, "that George Bush will abandon his pro-life stand, but I think we've all got to take this in perspective, which is, abortion is one 150th of the Republican Party platform."
But supporters of abortion rights vowed to keep up the fight. "I think we ought to do whatever it takes, whatever is necessary to remove this very contentious issue from the current platform," Senator John Seymour of California said tonight. "I know it's uphill, but we have to try."
It all made for a jittery scene as the 2,210 Republican delegates gathered for a convention that only a year ago was expected to be a rollicking coronation for the commander of Operation Desert Storm.
"Republicans haven't had a chance to make their case yet, and we've been getting bashed for weeks," said Kay Bailey Hutchinson, the Texas State Treasurer and a devoted Bush supporter. "It's our turn now."
Joe Duffel, a Republican leader in Contra Costa County, Calif., said simply, "Bush has got to come down here and announce some measures that are going to pep up the economy, because if the economy stays at the same level between now and November, he will not win."
 
Polls and the Party Spirit
 Delegates could take the edge off their anxiety at a full schedule of parties organized by the Houston Host Committee, from elegant soirees in the mansions on River Oaks Boulevard to rodeos out on the prairie beyond the suburbs. Fireworks lit the skies over Galveston Bay, greeters swarmed around arriving passengers at the airport, and cabdrivers chatted up their passengers about the virtues of Houston.
But the business at hand was deadly serious. The New York Times/CBS News Poll showed that Mr. Clinton, who received an enormous gain in the polls after his convention last month, remained well ahead of the President, 52 percent to 35 percent. While Mr. Clinton's overall lead dropped 7 percentage points, as expected as the Democratic convention receded, his support actually rose among some important groups: young people, middle-income ($30,000 to $50,000) voters, Midwesterners and Catholics.
If history is any guide, Mr. Bush will go a long way toward narrowing this race over the next four days; the burst of national attention around a nominating convention almost always produces a significant "convention bounce" in the polls.
Mr. Bush retains several strengths he can play to in the coming months, which will be highlighted in this week's convention program. For example, 58 percent said he could "deal wisely with a difficult international crisis," compared with 28 percent who expressed that confidence in Mr. Clinton. And Mr. Bush has a small edge over Mr. Clinton in being trusted to deal with problems that confront a President, a quality that his strategists argue is decisive in a Presidential election.
But the glow is clearly off Mr. Bush's conduct of the war in the Persian Gulf. When asked, "if you could change one thing George Bush did during his Presidency, what would it be?" the Gulf War was most frequently volunteered; it was cited by a fifth. And when voters were asked about the way Mr. Bush was now handling relations with Iraq, only 40 percent approved, while 48 percent disapproved.
 
Thumbs Down on Economy
 The poll underscores, however, what Mr. Bush's strategists are achingly aware of: The public is rendering a devastating verdict on the Bush economic record. Only 14 percent of American adults approve of the way Mr. Bush is handling the nation's economy, the lowest economic rating of his term, as low as any faced by President Jimmy Carter.
The survey also suggests that the political mood has shifted sharply since 1988, when the economy was still healthy and Mr. Bush was able to run on a promise of only modest shifts in the course set by President Ronald Reagan. For example, Mr. Reagan is now viewed unfavorably by more people than view him favorably. And the retrospective approval rating on his Presidency is now about the same as the retrospective on Mr. Carter's.
This suggests that turning the convention spotlight on Mr. Reagan on Monday night may not be entirely helpful to his party.
On the positive side, Barbara Bush remains an enormous asset to the Republicans: 74 percent have a positive opinion of her, and only 5 percent do not.
 
Comparing Parties
 There were, however, several other ominous notes in this poll for the Republicans: Fifty-seven percent of the voters now say they have a favorable opinion of the Democratic Party, compared with 47 percent who said they viewed the Republicans favorably. The Democrats also have an advantage on the Congressional level, in a year when an unusually high number of open seats are at stake: 45 percent said they would vote for the Democratic candidate for the House if the election were held today, while 35 percent said the Republicans.
Moreover, despite Republican attempts to capitalize on "family values" the two parties are tied in the public's mind on that issue. Thirty-six percent said Republicans would be better at "upholding traditional family values," while 37 percent said the Democrats would.
Moreover, Mr. Clinton has succeeded in getting a plurality of voters to consider him a moderate.
There was no surer sign of the altered political landscape than the voters' own handicapping of the race: Fifty-two percent now predict that Mr. Clinton will win in November, and 36 percent predict Mr. Bush.

HEADLINE: Port Authority Helps Homeless Find an Exit

BYLINE: By CATHERINE S. MANEGOLD

 BODY:
More than a decade after New York City started grappling with a surge in homelessness, a program by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to combine police enforcement with treatment has cleared out the authority's midtown bus terminal and started to wear away the building's image as a grim example of the link between bureaucratic failure and human pathos.
Only eight months after the program's start, social workers for Operation Alternative have handled 6,000 referrals for mental illness, drug and alcohol abuse and abject poverty. 
 They have also raised a tentative hope that the city's slow-moving bureaucracies may finally have started sketching out answers that move beyond the sweeps and crackdowns that typified early efforts, which were attacked as cruel and ineffective.
Advocates for the homeless give the Port Authority's approach grudging praise and complain only that the program should be better financed and integrated into a citywide plan. They argue, and public transportation officials increasingly agree, that long-term solutions will benefit both the homeless who live in public transit areas and the passengers who use them.
The benefits for the 185,000 people who pass through the terminal each day are clear. Once a nagging reminder of the city's social and economic ills, the terminal no longer represents a grim gantlet for bus passengers dodging beggars, drunks, thieves and destitute drug addicts. Hallways and corners that once were littered with the crouched and covered forms of up to 400 or 500 homeless people are now both empty and clean.
Officials with the Port Authority link that change to a sharp drop in crime. In the program's first seven months, reports of robberies in the terminal dropped by 39 percent compared with the same period last year. Reports of pickpockets were down by 41 percent and of assaults, by nearly one-fourth.
"Eight months ago when I came here," said Capt. William G. Cafaro, who supervises police operations at the Port Authority, "the big complaint was the homeless. Now, it is smoking."
The police report a similar though less dramatic drop in crime in the vicinity. In the Midtown South precinct that includes the Port Authority Bus Terminal, robberies declined by more than 15 percent in the first four months of this year compared with the same period last year. Grand larceny and assaults declined by 6.4 percent and 7.9 percent respectively.
When the police encounter someone who is homeless in the corridors, they tell the person to move along but also ask if he or she wants treatment or shelter. Many homeless people return to the streets, but some accept the offer and are escorted to an office on the ground floor.
 
Finally, Options
 There, social workers from the Manhattan Bowery Corporation and the Partnership for the Homeless, working under a contract with the Port Authority, direct homeless people to places to sleep, eat and recover from everything from heat exhaustion to multiple addictions seven days a week. "What this program has allowed us to do," said Janis M. Beitzer, the terminal's manager, "is to separate out different cases. The tendency is really to lump everyone together."
Still, seen against a broader background, the Port Authority's project is like a pea inside a bucket, a small glimpse of success in a deep well of failure. The sidewalk along Ninth Avenue is crowded with people living in boxes and eking out a bare existence. So are surrounding streets.
Summer is the slowest season for shelters. But most are full. A nearby Manhattan Bowery Corporation shelter and one run in the Bronx by the Partnership for the Homeless, which handle Port Authority referrals, are packed to capacity. Winter will surely make matters worse.
And with unemployment up and Federal financing for social projects already cut and facing further reductions, the problem continues to grow. Mary Brosnahan, the executive director of the Coalition for the Homeless, says that her group, which sets up regular food lines at various sites around the city, is feeding twice as many people as it did just six months ago, even at the Port Authority. At one food line in Harlem, there are now 50 children under 13 who depend on the nightly meals. And because the demands on that group have expanded suddenly in recent months, the meals have been cut back.
 
A Call for Compassion
 Critics say that public programs that stress evicting the homeless from such havens as bus terminals and train stations are the cruelest of all. "You shouldn't get tough on the issue, you should get smart," said Norman Siegel, the executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union and a longtime advocate for the homeless. "The city needs to develop a comprehensive plan to finally, once and for all, get beyond this terrible problem. We've been dealing with this for 12 years, and I don't see the light at the end of the tunnel."
No comprehensive program is in place. Yet the Port Authority's effort is one positive sign. "The Port Authority is one of the most progressive of the groups," said Ms. Brosnahan. "We just want to push them to be more progressive."
Operation Alternative's roughly $500,000 budget is barely one-thirtieth of the $15 million allocated to the Port Authority Bus Terminal police. And it constitutes less than 1 percent of the Port Authority Bus Terminal's annual $54 million budget. Mr. Siegel called the budget "insufficient," and said the city should commit at least $5 million toward a broad approach that would integrate housing with job training and treatment.
Advocates for the homeless said last week that the two groups hired by the Port Authority have been one factor in the program's success. They tended to criticize an older program, initiated in 1991 by the Metropolitan Transit Authority. Though that program, too, uses social workers to convince homeless people to get help, advocates said the M.T.A.'s follow-through is insufficient.
"Maybe they cleared up their problem," Mr. Siegel said of M.T.A. directors' claims that the number of homeless in the subways has dropped to about 700 to 1,000 from about 3,000 to 5,000 in the late 1980's. "But they dumped it onto the rest of the city."
 
Convincing the Homeless
 Bernard Cohen, director of the M.T.A.'s department of policy and planning, defended the M.T.A. program and stressed that it, too, contains a treatment component. During a tour of Grand Central Terminal with social workers last week, he said, he was told about a man who had lived there for four years. The social workers said they had just convinced the man to buy a ticket on Metro-North to go to a treatment center outside the city.
"I said, 'How do you know he got on the train?' " said Mr. Cohen. "So we walked over to the platform and, sure enough, he poked his head out and started chatting."
Wendy Feuer, the M.T.A.'s director for transit and facility design and one of the organizers of the program for the homeless, said she believed it was still evolving. "We are getting more sophisticated at handling these things," she said. But she pointed out that some people are harder to reach than others. "It's as though it's the last six miles of a marathon, when you really have to do hard work."
It took 10 years and a heart full of failure before Tony, 24, finally sought help and stayed with it. Last March 16, on the second day of a cold snap that covered Manhattan with a clear blue sky but left thermometers drifting between 17 degrees and a high that barely cleared the freezing mark, he wandered into the Port Authority Terminal to ask for help.
"I knew I had to stop or die," said Tony, who asked that only his first name be used to protect his family. He described a life of homelessness and drug abuse. "It got to the point where someone would want to kill me, someone including the police."
Shifting on a metal chair and recounting his years on the streets, Tony said his troubles started at 13 when a cousin invited him to help sell heroin and cocaine on the streets of Harlem. For three years, he took his pay in fancy clothes. Then, on his 16th birthday, he got a shoe box stuffed with $16,000. He also got a message: His cousin told him that from that day forward, Tony would be in business for himself.
Within a year, the cousin was dead and Tony's life started unraveling. In quick sequence he was shot, stabbed and attacked with a baseball bat. His drug use increased; his luck ran out.
Several times he quit taking drugs. Always he went back. By March, he knew he was near some personal end point, a moment when he had to change. He had heard that the Port Authority's program worked.
 
Help for Some, Not All
 Today, Tony still lives in a shelter run by the Manhattan Bowery Corporation. But he is off drugs, is working on his high-school equivalency diploma and has a paying job working every night with homeless people who, like him, wander in to seek the program's help.
Not everyone wants it. Last week, as a driving rain pelted rush-hour commuters, Mary Jane Manley and Lewis Terry sat on 41st Street, under the second-story link between the terminal's two buildings and shared a cigarette. Ms. Manley was drinking Thunderbird. Mr. Terry was sipping from a large bottle of beer inside a paper bag.
They passed the cigarette back and forth and said they had heard about the program. Mr. Terry said he did not go because he was a Vietnam veteran and would go to a Veterans Administration hospital if he needed help. Ms. Manley fished into a pocket for a letter of referral to the Port Authority's program.
"I want to go," she said. "I want to get myself back together again. Maybe this weekend. Maybe I'll go in there this weekend." Then she excused herself and her friend. They were busy drinking and talking. There were still a few drags in their cigarette. Ms. Manley tucked her referral letter away again. The center, she knew, would be open another day.

HEADLINE: LOOKING TO THE FUTURE: LOOKING AHEAD;
While in Houston to Help Bush, Many Have Eyes on 1996

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Aug. 16

 BODY:
Squadrons of political aides will be tensely watching their candidate this week to make certain he gets the biggest possible boost from the Republican National Convention.
But many of them will have their eye not on George Bush but on one of the Republicans already angling for a run at the Presidency in 1996. And as crucial as the convention is to Mr. Bush, it is almost as important to the others -- Vice President Dan Quayle, Patrick J. Buchanan and Housing Secretary Jack F. Kemp, to name just a few. 
 At times, jockeying for the 1996 race has overshadowed Mr. Bush's own campaign, and it might have been a central attraction in Houston this week had the convention turned out to the coronation ceremony that Mr. Bush had wanted. But with the President's re-election prospects shaky, the White House quietly passed the word that lobbying for 1996 should be done discreetly.
"We want to see less of that this year than you did in 1984, simply because we're in a tough race," a senior campaign official said. "In 1984, when Reagan was way ahead and everyone thought he would win big, people could get a little more aggressive about wining and dining and buttonholing and campaigning. We're fighting for our lives, everyone knows it, and we want to keep our eyes on that. If people can get exposure through their role in supporting Bush, more power to them."
 
Creating a Vacuum
 These concerns have tamped down the 1996 electioneering somewhat, but not entirely. After all, the jockeying over the next race was driven to large extent by Mr. Bush's own political problems.
His record-low poll ratings and his failure to project a strong ideology created a vacuum into which the 1996 contenders eagerly rushed. Their fight is, in part, over who will lead the party's conservative wing, which does not consider Mr. Bush a member. Indeed, a few conservatives concluded months ago that their cause might better be served if Mr. Bush lost.
This sort of split has not been erased by the show of unity the Republicans are putting on here, and the candidates for 1996 are looking for ways to gain even a slight edge. Mr. Kemp has been reminding everyone who will listen that he told Mr. Bush to back a tax cut, so if the President does something like that in his acceptance speech, the Housing Secretary can claim credit for inspiring it. If Mr. Bush does not, Mr. Kemp has made his point.
That kind of talk is just the sort of exposure that the crop of 1996 contenders is after. Many of them have had little or no introduction to the country as a whole. The latest New York Times/CBS News poll shows that Mr. Kemp's favorable rating, 21 percent, is two and a half times his unfavorable, 8 percent. But 71 percent said they were undecided or did not know enough about him.
 
Limelight for Others
 The Republicans have gone out of their way to make sure most of the 1996 candidates get a moment in the limelight, if only to avoid having them fight among themselves and distract attention from Mr. Bush.
Two notable exceptions are James A. Baker 3d, who has to remain in the background because he is still technically Secretary of State and has not officially taken over the campaign yet, and Gov. Pete Wilson of California, who begged off from the convention, citing his state's economic problems.
No matter. If Mr. Wilson remains mired in budget deficits and tax increases in California, no amount of speech-making at the convention is going to save him. Mr. Baker is going to get all the attention he wants -- and probably a lot more -- in the fall campaign.
No Republican has announced his candidacy for 1996, although Mr. Buchanan, who ran in the early Republican primaries this year, has left the door wide open. But the list of likely contenders is widely known in Washington and the face of the future of the Republican Party is white, male and conservative.
Mr. Quayle, Mr. Baker, Mr. Kemp, Mr. Buchanan, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney are most frequently mentioned for the A list. Some conservatives would put William J. Bennett, the former Education Secretary and anti-drug chief, in that group as well.
 
Robertson Included
 Republican strategists say the Rev. Pat Robertson, the television evangelist who ran in 1988, should never be counted out. He will be a host of a "God and Country" rally on Monday and he is on the list of convention speakers.
The B list includes Governor Wilson of California, Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts and Pete du Pont, the former Delaware Governor who made a marginal showing in the 1988 Republican nominating race and is now using his political organization -- the Committee for Republican Leadership -- as a national platform.
There is the long-shot list -- Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin and Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr. of South Carolina -- and the wish list. "The front-runner for the Republican nomination in 1996 won't be at the Republican convention," said Kenneth M. Duberstein, the former White House Chief of Staff. "He's too busy at the Pentagon. He's Colin Powell."
Mr. Quayle, who has the natural advantage of his office if he chooses to run in 1996, will have the highest profile here of any of the 1996 candidates: some two dozen public appearances and a major speech on Thursday night.
But Mr. Quayle also has the most at stake, given his seemingly unerasable unfavorable ratings (50 percent in the latest New York Times/CBS poll). The Vice President and his aides see the convention as one of two pivotal moments this year for him to "reintroduce" himself to the public. The other will be the Vice-Presidential debate with Senator Al Gore.
"The Vice President's staff was very envious of the way Gore was reintroduced at the Democratic convention," a senior official said. "It was very well handled and Quayle is hoping to do the same thing. His last time at a convention was pretty rotten."
 
Quayle's Reintroduction
 But Mr. Quayle comes to Houston after witnessing his worst nightmare come to life: While Gov. Bill Clinton presents Mr. Gore as virtually a co-President, Mr. Bush is putting forward his own dynamic duo -- with Mr. Baker, a rival who has disdained the Vice President, as the other half.
For his big moment, the Vice President is preparing what one aide called "a personal and defiant speech that will address substantive issues," in the context, as the aide put it: "This is what I stand for. People have tried to attack me for it. And I'm not backing down."
Mr. Gramm will get a lot of attention -- at the biggest social event of the week, the "Red, White and Boots" reception on Monday night, which is in his honor, and by giving the keynote speech on Tuesday night. He also has the opportunity for plenty of politicking as head of the Republican Senate Campaign Committee.
Mr. Buchanan, whose insurgent candidacy in the early primaries first threw the President's campaign off stride, will also speak. But the Bush team has tucked him into the program late on Monday evening, and made sure he would be overshadowed by a subsequent speaker, Ronald Reagan.
Mr. Cheney will be here, as "spouse of" Lynn Cheney, the head of the National Endowment for the Humanities. She will speak. He will not. But his supporters do not want his name forgotten. "Put him on the list," said one Cheney associate. What about Republicans who say Mr. Cheney is not interested in the Presidency, or would not run because of his history of heart problems? "Never mind that," the associate said. "Put him on the list."
 
'Bennett Is the Real Comer'
 Mr. Bennett has a featured spot on the program: putting Mr. Quayle's name into nomination. But he has infuriated the Bush team by making criticism of the President into a cottage industry, which delights conservatives.
"Bennett is the real comer," said Burton Yale Pines, chairman of the National Center for Policy Research, a conservative organization. "He's put more distance between him and this President than any of the other leading contenders. Bennett is going to be running for 1996 one day after this election is over."
Mr. Kemp has been credited with pushing Mr. Bush into a more active position on urban issues since the Los Angeles riots, giving himself new prominence along the way.
His outspoken views, often critical of the President at least by implication, have won him fans on the right. But they have made him enemies as well, including Mr. Baker, who, according to numerous published reports, blames Mr. Kemp for leaking accounts of a meeting at which the Secretary of State reportedly dismissed American Jews' concerns about the Administration's Israel policy with an obscenity.
"Jack Kemp is finally sitting in the circle with the big boys," Mr. Duberstein said. "The only problem is, he's in the middle, they're all armed, and they're firing inward."

Re-examining Bonds' Rally
New Questions Arise About Underpinnings

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The sharp fall in bond prices on Thursday raised doubts in the markets about the future of the rally that had carried the yield on the 30-year bond to its lowest level in five and a half years.
And those doubts, in turn, are making investors think about what has actually been driving this rally and what can upset it, even though bond prices rebounded on Friday. 
 Many analysts have thought that growing confidence about low and stable inflation could push bond prices to new highs and consequently push interest rates and yields to new lows. And, it appears, many traders and investors were not paying attention to the Presidential campaign and the ever-menacing Federal budget deficit. But last week's one-day slump may have changed that.
 
Era of Lower Rates
 While inflation is coming down -- as both the Consumer and Producer Price Indexes reaffirmed last week -- it is not yet clear to some analysts that the country is moving into a new era of lower inflation expectations, the kind that could push the yield on the long bond below 7 percent or lower. Such levels have not been seen in 20 years.
"I wonder if the markets have considered the longer-term outlook for inflation in a political sense?" said Norman Robertson, chief economist at the Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. "Will the political system allow a long-term attack on inflation? I have a feeling that in the business community, especially in manufacturing, that the cure is becoming worse than the disease; they feel that a little bit of inflation is not so bad, and it's better than no orders."
It may be that the more powerful force behind the rally is a seemingly unshakable consensus among investors and traders that the economy will continue to grow only sluggishly this year and into 1993. Because it is the usually strong growth at the beginning of a recovery that ignites inflationary concerns and prompts an increase in short-term interest rates, the absence of that possibility is making inflation less worrisome.
In addition, it may be that much of the rally reflects the search for higher yields because short-term interest rates have dropped so sharply in the last year. A year ago, the three-year note was auctioned at a yield of 6.92 percent. This week, that average yield fell to 4.69 percent.
In this case, the good news on inflation has not so much changed investors' minds as given them some comfort as they buy longer maturities once considered too risky.
In either case, however, it appears from the sharp move in the bond market on Thursday that it is easy to upset the confidence of the market.
 
Response to Baker
 The decline of more than a point in the price of the long bond on Thursday was, in part, because of investors' response to remarks by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d as he officially announced his resignation to become President Bush's chief of staff and guiding light of the re-election campaign.
The report by one news service carried the headline: "Baker says lower tax rates should be fundamental to campaign." That was quickly interpreted as a threat to the bond market because it could mean there would be tax cuts to stimulate the economy and even less concern about the growing Federal deficit.
While the market also fell because it had just come too far too fast, the reaction to Mr. Baker's comments shows that politics and the deficit can quickly re-enter the investor consciousness. This may mean that the economic program of Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the Democratic nominee for President, will come under closer scrutiny.
The prospect of a Democratic victory in November and the plan to stimulate the economy that Mr. Clinton promises could quickly unsettle the market. Some unsuspected signals of strength in the economy could also worry investors. Or just a renewed focus on the Government's record budget deficit could cause a case of the jitters.
 
Taking Some Profits
 In light of all the possibilities, Glenn E. Murphy, the chief investment officer of Travelers Asset Management International, is being cautious, though his expectation of a 2 percent inflation rate is below the rate of 3 to 3.5 percent now.
Last August, Mr. Murphy began heavy buying of 30-year Treasury bonds. At that time, he began to believe that inflation in the United States would fall sharply and stay low for some time -- the best of news for long-term bond investors.
But he still thinks a real change in expectations has not set in yet. "I think people are grudgingly working their way down the inflation curve," he said, "but it's only grudgingly."
He is now taking some of his profits on the long bond because he thinks that in the short term the bond market has moved ahead of itself. "The market is discounting more good news than is in the market, so I would be cautious," he said.
Whether the rally is over, is hard to answer. "The market is overextended, but interest rates are still on a downward trend," Mr. Murphy said.
Many traders said the market was due for a correction because it had risen so fast. But a correction does not mean a rally is over. The strong rebound in the market on Friday, which brought the yield on the long bond back down to the five-and-a-half-year low of 7.31 percent it reached Wednesday, means investors have not deserted.
The economic data released Friday, including the four-tenths of a percent increase in industrial production last month, after a four-tenths of a percent decline in June, still paints a picture of slow growth and declining inflation.
 
Bad News for President
 But if the rally is over, even just temporarily, that will be bad for the economy and bad for President Bush. It has been the relatively high level of long-term interest rates that has made it much harder for the Federal Reserve, despite its sharp cutting of short-term interest rates, to restart the economy. It is a problem that the chairman of the Fed, Alan Greenspan, has repeatedly complained about.
"I think long bonds have to come down more to reflect less inflation expectations and if you want the American economy to really get going," said Henry Kaufman of Henry Kaufman & Company.
For that reason, no matter what Mr. Baker meant to say about economic policy and the Presidential campaign last week, he may be trying to reassure the investors in the bond market that they have nothing to worry about.

HEADLINE: No Action Is Expected On Rates

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 16

 BODY:
Most monetary specialists believe that the Federal Reserve, ever-mindful of its reputation for independence, will shun further cuts in interest rates when its policy-making Open Market Committee meets on Tuesday for the first time in seven weeks.
New action that could reduce the lending rate for overnight banks loans and eventually even the discount rate is considered highly unlikely during the Republican National Convention, despite a recovery that is among the weakest on record. 
 By a quirk of the calendar, the central bank appears to face the same obstacle posed at its meeting of June 30-July 1, which took place just after President Bush specifically urged another round of rate cuts.
 
Stand Against Inflation
 No matter how it weighs the economic evidence, which has been decidedly mixed of late, the Fed cannot afford to give the impression of bowing to pressure from the Bush Administration in the election campaign, analysts say. Creating such an impression would almost certainly be counterproductive, arousing fears about the Fed's commitment to fight inflation and thereby raising the long-term banking rates so crucial to the home-building and capital investment essential to recovery.
"They'll be concerned about reducing interest rates in the proximity of the convention," said Robert A. Brusca, chief economist for Nikko Securities Company International and a strong advocate of more monetary stimulus.
Still, analysts said, the deliberations of this 19-member committee -- 12 of them voting at any given time -- could lead to a rate cut in the weeks ahead, most likely around Labor Day if August employment statistics show private payrolls grew by, say, less than 50,000. The jobs survey was taken last week, but the results will not be released until Sept. 4.
Other recent figures seem to point toward monetary easing, though not conclusively. Retail sales were reported up five-tenths of a percent in July, but a June gain of that amount was revised to show a loss. And an increase in industrial production was confined entirely to utilities and mining; manufacturing was flat.
"The economy's just muddling along -- there's no catalyst," said Alan C. Lerner, senior money market analyst at Bankers Trust.
At the same time, inflation appears virtually nonexistent. Prices at the consumer and producer levels edged up only one-tenth of a percent in July.
Yet various Fed officials are said to be worried that the score of interest rate cuts in the last two years might have put too much stimulus in the pipeline, and therefore they might resist adding further stimulus. Despite earlier easing, money-supply growth continues to lag.
On the Federal Reserve Board, whose seven members form a voting majority on the Open Market Committee, the cautious camp in general consists of those appointed by President Ronald Reagan. President Bush's three appointees are considered more receptive to further cuts.
The board is responsible for setting the Fed's discount rate, the rate the central bank charges financial institutions for loans. The other main tool of monetary policy, the market-based Federal funds rate for overnight loans among banks, is strongly influenced by the committee, which advises the Fed's trading desk about how scarce or how available it should seek to make bank reserves.
One thing that no doubt pleases the Fed is that long-term rates have declined significantly since the Open Market Committee's midyear meeting -- to about 7 3/8 percent from 7 3/4.
But this cuts both ways in terms of decision making, contended Jeremy A. Gluck, monetary specialist for Mitsubishi Bank in New York. He said policy makers could consider this either as a significant stimulus that might make further action unnecessary or as a vote of confidence in the Fed's anti-inflation commitment that could make further action possible.
Another factor in what might be decided this week, though probably not a controlling one, is the dollar's weakness. Recent central bank support for the dollar seems to argue against further rate cuts, which make the currency even less attractive, but analysts also note that a weak dollar aids exports, which have been slipping.
With no immediate rate changes likely to result from the Tuesday meeting, speculation will tend to center on the committee's directive to its securities trading desk in New York. At the May 19 meeting, the directive shifted to a neutral stance from one biased toward easing.
The directive adopted at the June 30-July 1 meeting -- the Fed cut rates sharply on July 2 in the wake of very poor employment data announced that morning -- will be exceptionally interesting when published on Friday, analysts said. It should provide insight on the extent to which the Fed foresaw the June jobs figures.
 
Shows Some Growth
 As for Tuesday's session, analysts say that the majority opinion at the Fed is probably impressed by the fact that the economy, however sputtering, has at least expanded a bit for five straight quarters. Thus, the majority view may be that further measures can be deferred.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Hachette Set To Give Elle A Makeover

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
Gilles Bensimon, the 48-year-old creative director of Elle, is surprisingly blunt about the fashion magazine's recent troubles. "Elle got to be boring," he said quietly in a heavy French accent, leaning back in a black leather sofa at Hachette Magazines' headquarters in Manhattan. "Our articles are going to be more deep."
That is quite an indictment coming from a man who has worked at Elle since it burst on the American scene in 1985 by being spunkier than Vogue, putting high fashion with street fashion and emphasizing faces rather than outfit-clad figures. 
 But if earnings and crucial newsstand sales are any indication, Mr. Bensimon knows what he is talking about. Profits of the American version of Hachette S.A.'s popular French magazine have skidded since 1989.
David Pecker, president of Hachette Magazines, said profits dropped to $10.5 million last year from more than $16 million in 1989. Revenues fell 10 percent, to $72 million from $80 million.
 
Bad Timing
 That puts a squeeze on Hachette, since Elle is the company's flagship publication and a leading money maker, along with Woman's Day, Car and Driver and Road & Track.
And the timing of Elle's slide could not be worse. On Aug. 25, the Hearst Corporation is scheduled to introduce an updated Harper's Bazaar, younger and hipper and homing in on Elle's territory. And of course, Vogue, published by Conde Nast, still dominates the market.
In response, Elle is diversifying, including more-conservative fashion coverage. It has undertaken an aggressive effort to lift newsstand sales, and it is widening the range of articles it publishes.
Elle swept on the scene in November 1985 with a slew of young, healthy, devil-may-care models. They were often photographed close up, with more emphasis on their faces and accessories than on the traditional outfits that were the standard fare of Vogue and Harper's Bazaar. Colors were hot. There was the pink section, the yellow section, the red section.
Or as Mr. Bensimon said: "Before we had visual shock. Now slowly we want to be more realistic." For example, the September issue carried an article on abortion, the kind of article that might not have appeared in earlier issues.
By 1989, Elle's circulation had soared 37 percent, to 826,000, from 600,775 at the end of 1986, challenging Vogue's dominance in the field, with a circulation of 1.2 million. Meanwhile, Harper's Bazaar, facing problems of its own, represented little threat.
In 1989, 60 percent of Elle's circulation came from newsstand sales, which are significantly more profitable than costly subscription sales and a key indicator of reader enthusiasm. And the magazine ran 2,321 ad pages that year.
The architect of Elle's at-first immensely popular editorial approach was Regiz Paniez, a Frenchman who had been associated with Hachette for many years. Mr. Paniez was on vacation and could not be reached for comment.
But readers can be as fickle about fashion magazines as they are about fashion. No sooner had the magazine peaked than ad pages began to slide and newsstand sales dived.
 
Recession, and Predictability
 The decline stemmed partly from the recession. Advertising in Elle fell 28 percent between 1989 and 1991, to 1,764 pages. In the same period, Vogue's dropped 24 percent. But Vogue lost almost no newsstand sales, while Elle's have fallen a sharp 40 percent. Newsstand sales now account for 41 percent of Elle's total circulation.
There were bright spots. Leo Scullin, a magazine consultant, noted that subscription sales had offset the drop in newsstand sales, so that while Vogue's circulation is flat, Elle's is up 10 percent from 1989, at 916,000, although mailing costs make subscriptions less profitable.
But the key problem for Elle, critics said, was its failure to change as competitors began emulating its innovations. Critics say the magazine became too predictable in trying to shock its readers, and its novelty wore off.
In 1988, Vogue hired Anna Wintour as editor. She immediately signaled her determination to make Vogue irreverent by putting on the cover a model in a $10,000 jewel-encrusted T-shirt and blue jeans.
The war had begun. There is no franchise on jeans and jewels or bright pink. If Elle could shock and mix and match, so could Vogue.
Mirabella, too, joined the fray. Though it attracted an older reader, Mirabella hurt Elle at the checkout counters, Mr. Pecker of Hachette says.
Such inroads dealt a cruel blow to Hachette, which has started 19 editions of Elle worldwide.
 
'We Have to Change'
 It also shocked Hachette's profits here, where Elle's contribution is critical. Woman's Day made about $25 million a year in the mid-1980's, while Car and Driver and Road & Track, now the two most profitable publications, earned close to $20 million each, Mr. Pecker said. At its peak, Elle, where editorial costs are higher than at the car publications, was still hugely profitable.
"We have to change," said Mr. Bensimon, who acts confident that Elle can regain lost ground. He said that in Vogue, "there are too many women in Versace and Chanel, young, rich and sophisticated, very dressed, lots of gold and shiny fashion."
And he added: "I admire Anna Wintour. Vogue is like a charming pretty woman, a pretty charming woman with money. When I open Vogue, I smell money. It is women who spend money with clothes and are not afraid to wear two gold Rolexes, perhaps."
Elle's new direction is perhaps reflected in his strikingly conservative September issue, with the model Claudia Schiffer in black, gray and white on the cover. "Sometimes you want to be more gray and beige, not show off at all," Mr. Bensimon said. "We are looking for a balance."
Elle is trying. It is spending aggressively on its crucial September issue, with promotions at newsstands across the country. And Mr. Paniez and others are making more of an effort to get around New York and rub shoulders with designers and advertisers.
But competition is tough.
Harper's parent, Hearst, is investing heavily in Bazaar, hoping to recoup readers it has lost. Advertising pages in the October issue of Bazaar are up while Elle's are down.
 
'We Flex a Little Muscle'
 "We did not even know the top people at Elle," one leading advertiser said. "They are not just visible or accessible, the way Vogue and Bazaar are. The book is the major thing, but when a publisher calls, all that massaging pays off."
And he added: "Advertisers expect editorial support. You can only expect what is fair. If we don't feel we are getting our fair share, then we flex a little muscle."
Several executives close to Elle said morale was low, partly because turnover among editorial employees was heavy.
In response, Mr. Bensimon said, "We haven't found a strong team, and we need that."
His decision to hire as fashion editor Tierney Gifford, former fashion director at the retailer J. Crew, is a nod to the importance of the American market.
And some in the magazine industry speculate that the publisher, Gail Stone, who joined the magazine in December 1991 after 18 years at Modern Bride, will be replaced by Douglas Johnson, former publisher at Vanity Fair, who is now a Hachette consultant. Mr. Pecker denied the rumors.
"They are changing" one editor said. "But it is going very, very slowly."

Buyers Seek Distress Sales as Newspaper Prices Stay Low

BYLINE: By Alex S. Jones

 BODY:
THOUGH few newspapers are being bought and sold these days, prospective buyers with cash in hand are sensing that some real bargains are available from sellers who need -- not merely want -- to sell.
Make no mistake. The vast majority of prospective sellers will not settle for the prices that newspapers currently bring and are hoping that an improved economy will restore newspaper prices to the glory days of the late 1980's. 
 Gerald D. Reilly, a newspaper broker, noted that three papers in New England -- he declined to identify them -- had recently been offered for sale and then withdrawn when the offers proved disappointing.
But in a few situations, sellers have little choice, such as when estate taxes after an owner's death make selling a virtual necessity. And it is these must-sell situations, especially in reasonably prosperous markets, that are attracting plenty of interest from newspaper entrepreneurs.
For instance, one head of a private newspaper chain who spoke on condition of anonymity said he was quietly raising an equity fund to take advantage of such distress sales.
"When somebody needs to sell, they're glad to see you," he said, noting that in the late 1980's, prospective buyers had to plead for a chance to bid.
In a sense, an ad in the Aug. 1 issue of Editor & Publisher, the industry's weekly trade magazine, reflected all aspects of today's complex market for newspapers and similar publications like the free "shoppers."
The ad, which covered about a third of a page, was placed by Dirks, Van Essen & Associates, a newspaper broker, to announce the sale July 1 of the Mason City (Iowa) Shopper, a weekly free publication with circulation of 30,000, to Lee Enterprises Inc., which owns the newspaper in Mason City. The shopper was sold by Darwin Oordt, who owns six other shoppers in the region through his company, Shopper Enterprises, based in Blue Earth, Minn.
The ad clearly reflected just how hard times are for newspaper brokers if such a modest transaction was heralded with such fanfare.
In 1989, Dirks, Van Essen published an identically sized ad promoting the sale of three small papers in South Carolina for nearly $75 million. By contrast, the Mason City Shopper deal, in which no price was given, was relatively small potatoes.
But Owen Van Essen, a partner in the firm, said Mr. Oordt was able to get a "full price" from Lee because Lee was removing a competitor. And he said Mr. Oordt was motivated to sell Mason City to enhance his ability to buy other properties, presumably at considerably less than full price.
Mr. Oordt did not respond to calls seeking comment.
 
Reward for Enterprise
Investigative journalism is being de-emphasized at some news organizations, where budget constraints and a shift to softer coverage have created new priorities.
But this year, two foundations are offering big cash prizes for investigative reporting, hoping to encourage more of it.
The Pope Foundation in New York City will award three annual $15,000 prizes for investigative work produced during the last three years.
And the Goldsmith-Greenfield Foundation of Sarasota, Fla., has endowed the Goldsmith Awards Program, which includes an annual prize of $25,000 for investigative reporting during the last year. The Goldsmith Awards are administered by the Joan Shorenstein Barone Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.
The Pope Foundation was founded in 1949 by Generoso Pope, the late publisher of Il Progresso Italo-Americano, a New York Italian weekly aimed at immigrants like Mr. Pope, who made most of his fortune from tugboats and construction.
One of his sons, who bore his name and has since died, was the longtime owner of The National Enquirer but was not involved in the Pope Foundation. Rather, the foundation is administered by two other sons, who steered most of its grants to education.
But last year, Catherine Pope, the founder's granddaughter and the foundation's program director, persuaded the family that investigative journalism needed a boost.
Ms. Pope, who has a background in advertising, said that she had decided to push for the prize after listening to friends in network television complain that budgets were being cut in investigative-reporting units.
Similarly, Marina C. McCarthy, administrator of the Goldsmith Awards, said that their prize sprang from a conviction by the Goldsmith-Greenfield Foundation that the foundation's sponsor, the late Berda Goldsmith, would have wanted it that way.
"Her heroes were Woodward and Bernstein," Ms. McCarthy said.
 
Big Plans, and Jail
For nearly a decade, one of the most mysterious figures hovering at the edge of the nation's newspaper industry has been Peter Wirs.
But Mr. Wirs's long and fruitless effort to break into the newspaper business in a big way has finally landed him in jail, in York, Pa.
Mr. Wirs first appeared in the mid-1980's, when he declared that his Philadelphia-based company would acquire United Press International. But he had no money and no financing.
In U.P.I. and other ventures, he would use his obvious intelligence, persuasive tongue, and ability to write long, impressive business plans to form tenuous alliances with major companies like New York Telephone. He would then use their resources to pursue deals that never happened.
When the two daily papers in York said in 1989 that they wanted to form a joint operating arrangement, merging production and business operations, Mr. Wirs arrived in York declaring he would start two new papers.
Many in the town welcomed the idea, and Mr. Wirs contracted with a company to prepare a sophisticated direct-mail solicitation to sell advance subscriptions to his new papers.
Glenn S. Coffey, deputy prosecutor of York County, said Mr. Wirs then wrote a bad check for $25,000 and was found guilty at a trial. He had already pleaded guilty to writing a bad check for $4,911 to an airplane charter company and had been sentenced to 23 months' probation.
When Mr. Wirs did not appear at his sentencing hearing, he was declared a fugitive.

HEADLINE: Laredo, Tex., Braces for Free Trade

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LAREDO, Tex., Aug. 15

 BODY:
For the last 250 years, the economic rhythms in this town at Mexico's doorstep have been set by events on the other side of the Rio Grande. But it is clear that few developments in Laredo's colorful history will prove more epochal than the removal of high tariffs that protected Mexican commerce from competitors in the North.
After it joined the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in 1987, Mexico slashed tariffs on American imports of shoes, apparel and soft drinks, to an average of 5 percent today from 80 percent. Since then the Laredo economy -- dominated by warehousing, trucking and retailing businesses -- has been surging. 
 And if the optimists are correct, the economic growth will continue as a result of the North American Free Trade Agreement on which negotiators completed work last week. The deal still requires legislative approval in Canada, Mexico and the United States, but residents, developers and bankers here are already hoping that American and Canadian companies will begin to build manufacturing and distribution plants in Laredo to be closer to Mexican markets.
 
The Obstacles to Growth
 But obstacles on both sides of the border could prevent or restrict those investments. They include poor roads made dangerous, and occasionally deadly, by the lengthening caravans of 18-wheel trucks bearing down from the north. And some local businessmen say there is a tradition of occasional graft in the Mexican courts that would make expansion by American companies risky.
Laredo, a town with an Old World Spanish feel, is populated mainly by poor Mexican-Americans. Half of all freight shipments moving into Mexico from the United States pass through Laredo, which sits on the Pan American Highway, 150 miles south of San Antonio and north of Monterrey, a big Mexican industrial city with more than three million people.
As the United States' overall exports to Mexico have tripled to more than $33.5 billion in five years, so has the number of trucks crossing at the International Bridge at Laredo. Most haul raw materials, component parts and other products to 170 maquiladora plants in Nuevo Laredo and other towns in northern Mexico.
Analysts and business leaders here say that more maquiladoras, assembly sites for everything from wire harnesses for automobiles to shoes and kitchen cabinets, will be built whether or not the trade agreement is enacted. The cheap labor, with hourly wage rates near $1 now, has steadily lured more American companies since the Mexican Government sharply devalued the peso against the dollar in 1982 -- a decline that has continued virtually unabated.
But many Laredo business owners who prospered by adjusting to the ways of protectionist Mexico say the free trade era could ruin them. The network of customs brokers that sprang up to guide shippers through the rituals of Mexican customs agents is threatened.
So are Laredo trucking companies that do most of their work within 20 miles of the border, handling the transfer of trailers stocked with American goods onto Mexican-chartered trucks. Mexican law currently bans American trucking companies from hauling any goods south of the border, but that stricture would be phased out over seven years under the free-trade pact.
 
'The Fear of the Unknown'
 "If a U.S. carrier can go all the way to Mexico City, and a Mexican carrier can go all the way to Chicago, there won't be any need to stop in Laredo," said George Quesada, president of Gateway Transfer Inc. in Laredo. He said 80 percent of Gateway's business was transferring trailer rigs between American and Mexican trucking companies.
Local bankers and business experts agree that free trade will jolt some parts of the border economy. Recent studies by the University of Texas and Deloitte & Touche, the accounting firm, concluded that many big American retailers would open stores in big population centers like Mexico City and Monterrey.
That would mean fewer Mexican consumers traveling by car and bus from as far away as Mexico City to shop at American border stores, the studies concluded. Gerry Schwebel, senior vice president at the International Bank of Commerce, the largest bank based in Laredo, said many business owners like Mr. Quesada were confused and worried.
"The biggest concern we have is the fear of the unknown," Mr. Schwebel said. "It's how the small and medium-sized companies adjust to improving competition that will make them succeed or get hurt."
For most of Laredo, the easing of trade barriers so far has been a boon. The jobless rate, averaging 9.6 percent this year through June, is the lowest in more than a decade. About 10,000 jobs have been added in the last four years, a gain of 23 percent, to 54,000, according to the Texas Employment Commission. The average annual pay in last year's fourth quarter, was $17,700, up 7.7 percent from $16,400 at the end of 1990.
The opening of a new Wal-Mart discount store three miles north of the Rio Grande on July 25 gives one measure of how Laredo retail sales have surged since the Mexican Government pared tariffs five years ago.
The hulking Wal-Mart store, the biggest of the nearly 1,800 Wal-Marts in the nation that do not sell groceries, replaced a smaller store opened in 1983 that had posted more sales in each of the last five years than any other Wal-Mart.
Other national retailers are moving in. Laredo's first Toys "R" Us is being erected as part of a new mall that will stand across a field from the new Wal-Mart. A Target discount store is ready to open nearby.
Vicente V. Garza, who owns several shops in town along the river, said more Mexicans were shopping in Laredo and border towns closer to the Gulf of Mexico, including McAllen, Harlingen and Brownsville, because the GATT rules had effectively lowered prices Mexicans pay for merchandise north of the Rio Grande.
Local officials are scrambling to build new roads and expand other city services, while Laredoans complain of a shortage of apartments and new homes. Analysts and builders say warehouse space is leased quickly. The Laredo population is expected to reach 200,000 later this decade, up from 133,000 today.
 
'We Already Have Free Trade'
 For now, Laredo is the fastest growing city in Texas. The city manager, Peter H. Vargas, said new construction, business expansions and other indicators of growth should continue to rise about 25 percent a year if the free trade pact is enacted.
"Free trade? For practical purposes, we already have free trade in Laredo," Mr. Vargas said. Not entirely, of course. Mexican labor laws still make it far more costly for American companies to ship concrete forms, build metal warehouses and provide other goods and services in Mexico than in the United States. One example: Concrete mixed by machine in the United States and made into forms for roads, walls or other uses, must be priced in Mexico as if the entire process were done by hand.
 
Wary of Expanding South
 And Mexico's legal system makes some border business executives wary of expanding south of the Rio Grande. There are no jury trials in Mexico, and legal codes are far more brief than in the United States, factors that give Mexican judges vastly more power than American judges.
Mr. Garza, whose stores generated sales of $40 million in American border towns last year mostly from Mexican shoppers, said he had no plans to open stores across the river in Nuevo Loredo, with its 475,000 people; near the Gulf of Mexico, where another 600,000 Mexicans live by the border, or in populous Monterrey, three hours south of Laredo by car.
"Even with your own people, you can still get into trouble in Mexico with their laws," he said. "If you try to claim anything or sue anybody, it's only the final word of the judge."
Mr. Garza said that many Mexicans used to buy goods in big quantities at wholesale prices from him and other retailers on the American side, then bribe Mexican customs agents to avoid big tariffs when they crossed the border. That left hefty profits for them after they sold the goods. Lower tariffs and better audits at Mexican customs offices caused these Mexican peddlers to buy more cheap imports from foreign suppliers, he said.
"Without GATT, our sales would have been 50 percent higher than where they are," Mr. Garza said. "Still, we can't complain. Our sales have been going up."

HEADLINE: PARTY IN THE SPOTLIGHT;
Bush Trails, to Varying Degrees, in 3 Polls

 BODY:
Three new nationwide polls before the Republican National Convention show Gov. Bill Clinton's lead over President Bush to range from 17 to 23 percentage points, but the polls disagree whether that advantage has increased or eroded since the Democratic convention in July.
The Los Angeles Times Poll of 1,146 registered voters, taken Wednesday through Friday, showed Mr. Clinton preferred by 56 percent and Mr. Bush preferred by 33 percent. That 23-point advantage represented a slight widening from the 20-point Democratic advantage in a Los Angeles Times poll at the end of the Democratic convention. 
 The Newsweek Poll of 750 registered voters, conducted Thursday and Friday by the Gallup Organization, showed Mr. Clinton leading Mr. Bush by 53 percent to 36 percent. That 17 percentage point margin was narrower than the 27-point lead for Mr. Clinton in a Newsweek poll right after the Democratic convention.
A separate Gallup Poll of 1,001 registered voters, taken last Monday to Wednesday for CNN and USA Today, showed a 19-point gap: 56 percent for Mr. Clinton and 37 percent for Mr. Bush. That poll concluded Mr. Clinton had shown little erosion between the party conventions; three earlier Gallup Polls had put Mr. Clinton's advantage at 20 to 25 percentage points.
Each of the new telephone polls had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three or four percentage points.

HEADLINE: Germans Love the Mark More As United Europe Gets Closer

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FRANKFURT

 BODY:
Haunted by Nazism since World War II, Germany has had few proud symbols on which to base its sense of nationhood. One has been its very successful soccer team. But perhaps the most powerful emblem of the country's resurgence from ruin has been the Deutsche mark, long Europe's strongest and most stable currency.
"After Hitler, we could hardly be proud of our flag," said Gunter Grosche, a senior official at the Finance Ministry. "The only thing to be proud of was our reconstruction, and the great symbol of this has been the mark." 
 Now, Germans are awakening uneasily, and with increasingly virulent misgivings, to the prospect of having to give up the Deutsche mark, and their opposition could unravel the introduction of a common currency in Europe and seriously hinder the European Community's quest for full union.
Under the European Community's ambitious plans for monetary union, a single European currency, the ECU, is supposed to be introduced in 1999 at the latest, replacing national currencies. The ECU, an acronym of European Currency Unit, was conceived as a catalyst to move Europe beyond a trading block to a federal power comparable to the United States.
When the plan was drafted last year, and enshrined in the 12-nation community's Maastricht Treaty, there was scant opposition in Germany. While Britain had reservations about a single currency and reserved the right not to participate in the Maastricht plan, Germany was enthusiastic, confident of its newly strengthened role in Europe after unification.
But since then, as the full cost of absorbing the Eastern part of the country has become apparent, the eventual loss of the mark has begun to look unacceptable. While most German politicians remain determined to push ahead with the Maastricht plan, it will clearly be impossible to enact if the current mood persists.
Of the other currencies affected by the treaty, the mark is by far the strongest. Therefore, Germans worry that they will have to subsidize weaker nations, as they feel they have done for the former East Germany, and that a new currency will ignite inflation.
Letters are pouring into the Finance Ministry protesting the planned introduction of the ECU (pronounced eh-cue) and reflecting what Mr. Grosche called "the incredibly passionate feelings people have about the mark."
Recent opinion polls have shown that only 20 percent of Germans are in favor of the projected European currency, while 70 percent believe the ECU would not be as strong as the mark. And, last month, 62 leading German economists issued a strongly worded statement arguing against the replacement of the mark.
National anxiety over the prospect of losing the mark has grown sharply despite the fact that the date for the proposed change is still several years off and ratification of the Maastricht Treaty is by no means certain. Denmark has rejected the treaty, and France is set to vote on it in September. No referendum is planned in Germany, however.
In part, the growing disquiet reflects Germany's current problems, particularly the realization that converting the former Communist economy of the East means that the steadily rising standards of living enjoyed since World War II are no longer inevitable.
Heavy spending in the East -- more than $100 billion will be transferred this year -- has led to a growing budget deficit, unusually high inflation and tense strikes over pay as Government demands for belt-tightening are met by intransigent calls by unions for salary increases as high as those in past years. With this unfamiliar turmoil, confidence has given way to insecurity.
 
Cause for Resentment
 "Germans are feeling uneasy, and so giving up the mark now seems unimaginable to many," said Klaus Fridrich, the chief economist for Dresdner Bank. "Moreover, there is some feeling in the former West Germany that it is subsidizing the consumption of the East which is living beyond its means. This causes resentment."
Many now seem afraid that the difficult East German experience could eventually be repeated with the rest of Europe.
If poorer European countries -- like the former East Germany, whose Ostmarks were generously converted into Deutsche marks -- are given a stronger currency than their economic situation merits, Germans worry that they will end up subsidizing them, too.
"East Germans got more purchasing power than they were entitled to," said H. Jorge Fehmer, the treasurer of the Ford Motor Company's German subsidiary. "So we transfer an enormous amount of money to them. People are concerned that the ECU could cause similar distortions, and we'd end up footing the bill."
 
Roots of Inflation Fears
 The other big fear centers on inflation. In a country where savings and assets have twice been wiped out this century, first by hyperinflation in the 1920's and then again in the 1940's, the stability of the Deutsche mark is a point of almost pathological pride.
Now that annual inflation has gone up to almost 5 percent -- well above traditional postwar levels -- people have become particularly sensitive about the notion of giving up the mark.
This anxiety was pinpointed by the 62 leading economists in their recent statement. "There is still not a consensus in Europe to consider price stability as a priority as it is in Germany," they said.
For the past 20 years, German inflation has totaled just 113 percent, well below the level of any other European Community country. In Britain, for example, the corresponding rate is 524 percent.
The Bundesbank, or German central bank, which has been the architect of Germany's price stability, counters critics of the Maastricht Treaty with the argument that the envisioned European monetary union was based on Bundesbank criteria. Thus, rather than diluting the power and stability of the mark, the Bundesbank says the plan will hitch other currencies to Germany's stringent standards.
 
Treaty Speaks of Stability
 "We feel we worked very strong guarantees on price stability into the Maastricht Treaty," said Manfred J. Korber, the chief spokesman for the Bundesbank. The treaty speaks of price stability being the primary objective for the planned European central bank in its management of the ECU.
However, the Bundesbank has warned repeatedly that unless political union accompanies the proposed economic union, the plan could unravel. In the United States, for instance, the Federal Reserve System and the dollar would scarcely function if all decisions on government spending and taxes were left to individual states.
Under the terms of the Maastricht Treaty, a European Monetary Institute is to be established in 1994. This body, run by officials of national central banks, will act as the precursor of the European Central Bank, working to harmonize national economies to the point where a single currency may be successfully introduced.
 
Timetable for the ECU
 The institute is to give way to an independent European central bank by July 1, 1998, at the latest, with the ECU being introduced six months later in those countries that meet the standards set by the treaty.
These standards include a requirement that no country's inflation rate should exceed that of the three best-performing countries by more than 1.5 percentage points and that no budget deficit should exceed 3 percent of gross national product.
The Bundesbank clearly takes these stipulations seriously. In a recent statement it said that "the success of stability policy in the monetary union will hinge upon the range of participants being strictly oriented toward the entry criteria and upon admission being granted only to countries with durably low rates of inflation."
This view was echoed last month by Finance Minister Theo Weigel as he sought to calm the growing wave of objections to the loss of the mark.
"Germany will not permit a dissolution of the criteria for the transition to a joint currency," Mr. Weigel said.
 
Political Willpower Is Strong
 The political willpower to go ahead with monetary union indeed remains strong. Most politicians share Chancellor Helmut Kohl's view that only a united Germany firmly hitched to Europe is politically acceptable to the country's neighbors.
"If European union fails, all we will have is railing against the hegemony of Germany," predicted Mr. Grosche of the Finance Ministry.
Already, in recent months, high German interest rates, intended to fight inflation, have been widely criticized elsewhere in Europe as holding back a recovery and as an illustration that Germany is not prepared to heed its neighbors.
Several officials said the strongest reassurance to Germans in their current mood of anxiety would be a community decision to place the future European central bank in Frankfurt.
"I do not think this is a point on which we can compromise," said Mr. Grosche of the Finance Ministry. Mr. Korber of the Bundesbank described having the bank in Germany as "very important."
But London, Amsterdam and Lyons, France, are also bidding for the bank in a typical European Community spat, while Bonn is being tentatively put forward by some German officials as a possible compromise.
"I feel very strongly that the European Central Bank should be in Frankfurt, and I think most Germans feel the same way," said Norbert Kuhne, Ford's finance director in Germany. "The Deutsche mark has been strong and this will create the feeling that the ECU will be strong, too. Why go to some other country and start over again when confidence is what a new money needs?"

HEADLINE: Job Loss in Pact Is Seen as Small

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
The North American Free Trade Agreement is a potent new source of anxiety for workers rattled by recession and high unemployment in the United States. But economists have reached a consensus that the negative effects of freer trade with Mexico on jobs, though painful, will almost certainly be smaller than many now fear.
If ratified, the pact will gradually phase out most United States tariffs on imports from low-wage Mexico, while knocking down roadblocks to American investment below the Rio Grande. "People are very, very concerned about losing jobs," said Victor M. Munoz, an A.F.L.-C.I.O. organizer in California and Texas. "It's the biggest topic." 
 A research team at the University of Michigan has concluded that as few as 15,000 to 75,000 American workers -- out of a work force of 120 million -- could lose their jobs over 10 years as a result of the pact. The researchers analyzed United States trade agreements since the round of global trade talks during the Kennedy Administration. At least as many jobs are likely to be gained as lost, the researchers concluded.
 
Topic of Political Debate
 The notion that American job losses, over all, will not be overwhelmingly large is in contrast to the heated political debate on the topic in recent weeks, particularly considering the widespread impression that many billions of dollars will be needed to compensate such workers. What is more, the job cuts are likely to be matched by job gains elsewhere in the economy, the researchers say.
Displaced workers -- divided more or less evenly between managers and professionals, skilled and unskilled workers -- would be forced to find jobs in other industries and other states, risking long spells of unemployment. Some may need job retraining or more education.
The losers are likely to be dispersed across many states and industries. No state, for example, is likely to suffer more than one-sixth of the total job losses, the researchers say. And the net losses for states that lose more jobs than they add -- probably California and the upper Midwest -- are expected to range from a few dozen jobs to a couple of thousand.
Permanent job losses from freer trade with Mexico are likely to be limited further by the phasing in of tariff reductions over as many as 15 years, especially for products like fruits and vegetables that are politically important because of the opposition of American growers.
As for the automobile industry, the sheer complexity of new rules setting minimum levels for domestic parts in auto production, along with the dilapidated state of much of the Mexican auto industry, should slow Mexico's penetration of United States markets.
 
Winning and Losing Industries
 "Some industries will expand while others contract, and workers will have to shift from one industry to another," said Robert M. Stern, an economist at the University of Michigan. The analysis was conducted by Professor Stern, along with a colleague, Alan Deardorff, and Drusilla Brown at Tufts University.
Their analysis is intended to serve as an indication of the scale and potential regional effects of the trade agreement, not as a precise prediction of particular numbers of jobs lost or gained by particular industries.
In New York state, for instance, a couple of thousand jobs in electrical equipment manufacturing may well disappear over a decade as less- skilled assembly jobs go to Mexico. But more jobs could emerge in industries like publishing, computers and even apparel, ultimately providing a net gain to New York of an estimated 700 jobs. Total factory jobs in the state now number just under a million; New York's exports to Mexico nearly reached $1 billion last year.
Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the New York regional commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said of the impact of the accord on the state: "It's not black and white. But on the whole, it's going to be a plus."
Or consider Texas, the biggest exporter to Mexico among the 50 states. It may gain jobs in agriculture, chemicals and plastics, but risks losing 1,000 more jobs in industries like glass, metal fabrication and production of transportation equipment.
Professors Stern, Deardorff and Brown tried to factor in the effects of stepped-up American investment in Mexico, the biggest concern in the eyes of American labor unions, as well as the reduction of tariffs.
 
Other Causes of Job Losses
 Even so, the number of workers displaced each year by the trade pact, Professor Stern reckoned, would be roughly one-tenth the number of those who will lose their jobs because of cuts in military spending, to say nothing of the even larger number laid off as a result of the recent recession.
Raul Hinojosa Ojeda, a professor of urban planning at the University of California at Los Angeles and a co-author of a new study of the California economy, said, "We have lost more jobs to Arizona and Nevada than to Mexico."
That is not as surprising as it appears. Mexico's economy is just one-twentieth the size of that of the United States. American tariffs on most Mexican goods are already negligible. Most important, the export of American jobs will be limited by the fact that it now takes, on average, three Mexican factory workers to produce the same amount in an hour as one American worker, limiting the number of activities that can be profitably relocated to Mexico.
The losers are likely to be in industries that have been moving assembly operations to lower-wage countries. The winners are likely to be heavy machinery, chemicals and other manufacturing industries that have already benefited from the doubling of exports to Mexico from the United States since 1987.
Textiles, apparel and agriculture, commonly thought to be big losers, might actually add jobs.
"Everybody's all freaked out about garments," Professor Hinojosa Ojeda said. "But the L.A. garment industry is a competitive design and marketing center. Mexico, on the other hand, is extremely uncompetitive."
 
Estimates of Lost Wage
 The University of Michigan team figures that the amount of wages likely to be lost by displaced workers will probably not exceed $400 million in today's dollars, or $40 million a year, over the decade. That is just a fraction of the more than $4 billion currently budgeted -- if not necessarily effectively spent -- by the Federal Government for job training programs and for compensating workers who lose jobs because of imports.
The new estimate of dollar losses is smaller than an earlier projection by Gary Hufbauer and Jeffrey Schott at the Institute for International Relations. Nonetheless, they agree that compensating workers hurt by the trade agreement will not be as costly as many critics of it seem to believe.
The House majority leader, Representative Richard Gephardt of Missouri, recently proposed a border tax to finance a program for displaced workers. But he does not now have a working estimate for the number of individuals likely to need assistance. "We sympathize with Gephardt's concern, but we don't think we need something like a border tax," Mr. Hufbauer said. "We're not talking big bucks."

Aerospace Publications Hurt by Military's Cuts

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 16

 BODY:
A big decline in Pentagon spending and economic problems in the commercial airline industry have drastically cut advertising and have forced staff cuts at aerospace publications.
The fortunes of many trade publications and of the industries they cover often rise and fall in tandem. And as military spending is set to drop for at least the next few years, few in the aviation-publication industry see an upturn soon. 
 "This industry is probably going through the most difficult time of the last 40 years," said Kenneth E. Gazzola, publisher and executive vice president of McGraw-Hill Inc.'s Aviation Week Group. "In the wake of the cold war, this industry is still trying to find a new level of equilibrium."
 
Corporate Cuts and Ad Cuts
 In the May issue of Aviation Week and Space Technology, a leader among publications focusing on aerospace technology, ad pages sank 28 percent from a year earlier, the Rome Reports/Magazine Week Trade Monitor said.
Mr. Gazzola said Aviation Week "had some staff trimmings and consolidated some positions," though he declined to specify how many cuts were made and in what areas. The publication does not intend to close any of its 12 news bureaus worldwide right now, he said, "but we continue to evaluate" possible further cuts.
Pentagon spending peaked in 1989 at $350 billion when converted to estimated 1993 dollars, and by 1992, spending had dropped 9 percent, to $319 billion in 1993 dollars, said Steven Kosiak, an analyst for the Defense Budget Project, a Washington-based nonprofit, nonpartisan research group. Under the Bush Administration plan, military spending is projected to drop 29 percent by 1997, to $250 billion, from 1989 levels, he said.
In turn, aerospace companies are cutting payrolls and other costs. The McDonnell Douglas Corporation, the St. Louis aerospace giant, has halved its advertising budget over the last three years, said Bob O'Brien, director of advertising. The company also said last week that it would consolidate its organization, shut parts plants in Ohio and Culver City, Calif., and possibly sell its helicopter business in Arizona. This comes after the company has cut about 30,000 jobs.
 
Special Deals for Advertisers
 "Our contractors are having major layoffs and cutbacks, and we are not exempt from that," Mr. Gazzola said, adding that the paid circulation of 140,000 subscribers has helped the publication remain profitable. An average of 70 percent of the subscribers renew each year, he said.
Mr. Gazzola said his publication has offered special deals in which companies may get free advertising in the Aviation Week Group's daily newsletter if they pay for advertising in the weekly glossy magazine.
Another publication, Aerospace Products, a magazine published seven times a year by Gordon Publications Inc. in Morris Plains, N.J., saw advertising pages in its May issue drop 76 percent from May 1991, according to Rome Reports/Magazine Week Trade Monitor. Dave Gardner, the publisher, said the plunge in May ad pages stems partly from special advertising for an air show in the May 1991 issue. The publication has a circulation of 100,000, which is delivered without charge to targeted markets.
"When defense spending was down during the 80's, you could usually count on commercial aviation spending to be up, and that's not happening now," Mr. Garner said, adding that his publication has been scrambling to find new subscribers as many of the previous ones had been laid off.
John Emery, president of American Business Press, an association of business and trade magazines, said the drop in ads at aerospace publications is "serious, but does not necessarily indicate a catastrophe."
Mr. Gardner added: "There will always be an aviation and aerospace market, but right now neither one is strong enough to hold us up, and that's what concerns me most. And I don't see it changing any time soon."

BYLINE: By NADINE BROZAN

 BODY:
The differences between Republicans and Democrats are as evident in the restaurant arena as they are in the voting booth, or at least that is what the response to a special poll conducted recently in the Washington area indicates.
Of the 1,530 people who answered a special questionnaire appended to the regular Zagat survey of consumer assessments of restaurants, 72 percent said that Republicans were likely to spend more money dining out than were Democrats. 
 Among the reasons listed: "They have more money," "They have bigger expense accounts," "They enjoy the good life" and "They still eat meat."
Of the minority who wrote in that Democrats spend more, some said, "Being liberal means spending liberally," "They're used to writing checks," "Weren't they the ones that bounced all those checks?" and "Democratic women are more liberated from the kitchen."
TIM ZAGAT, publisher of the Zagat surveys, said the other day that "this was done for the fun of it, but in a funny kind of way, the answers give a glimpse into what people really think." He said that "by asking in the context of something that is offbeat -- food -- you get an interesting view of what people think of the two parties and of GEORGE BUSH."
A question asking respondents which restaurant they would take the President to also elicited revealing answers.
Many people chose some of the capital's toniest restaurants, such as L'Auberge Chez Francois, Jean Louis at Watergate, Le Lion d'Or and the Inn at Little Washington, and said they would order for him such dishes as chateaubriand, venison or "a brace of quail with foie gras."
But a number of people suggested that the President try the fare at a homeless shelter, and one participant said he would invite Mr. Bush to his home for "recession ragout."

The Democrats' Dilemma
Walter F. Mondale and the Liberal Legacy
By Steven M. Gillon
Illustrated. 468 pages. Columbia University Press. $34.95. 
The L word -- liberalism, not love -- is at the center of the 1992 Presidential campaign. The Republicans attack it; the Democrats avoid it. It's why the Democratic Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates, playing their rhetoric down the middle, have been called Democratic Republicans, anything but liberals. Trying to pin the old liberal label on the Democratic donkey has confused the Republican Republicans. It's clear that an aim of the Republican convention is to make the phantom liberalism a continuing idea and dirty word.
Although "The Democrats' Dilemma" was completed before the Clinton-Gore campaign strategy this summer, the L word is still visible in Steven M. Gillon's challenging book, which is subtitled "Walter F. Mondale and the Liberal Legacy." Mr. Gillon, an associate professor of history at Yale, is the author of "Politics and Vision: The A.D.A. and American Liberalism, 1947-85." (A.D.A. stands for Americans for Democratic Action.) His new book is a fairly objective, not uncritical biography of former Vice President Walter F. Mondale, who was defeated in his bid for the Presidency by the incumbent, Ronald Reagan, in 1984. What recommends this well-researched book is not so much the biography but the fact that it emerges as a study of the American political scene and electorate in the last quarter-century.
"The Democrats' Dilemma" is filled with insights about running for President, including some by Mr. Mondale himself. After his losing campaign, Mr. Mondale told friends, "Reagan was promising them 'morning in America,' and I was promising a root canal."
In a telling remark defining his differences with many older Democrats, Senator Tim Wirth of Colorado said: "We were products of television, not of print. We were products of computer politics, not courthouse politics. And we were reflections of J. F. K. as President, not F. D. R."
The biography presents Mr. Mondale as a decent, sensitive public servant, well qualified to be President and in the tradition of his mentor, former Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey. As the Attorney General of Minnesota at the age of 32, Mr. Mondale converted a ceremonial office into a center of activism. During his 12 years as a Senator, he initiated legislation for a fair-warning-standards act, a fair-housing act and a filibuster-campaign-reform act. Mr. Gillon asserts that Mr. Mondale was frustrated as Vice President and at one point thought of resigning.
He also finds that Mr. Mondale had a faulty political vision and was unable to adjust to the demands of a modern media age. He writes: "Mondale was a transitional figure between two generations of Democrats. On one side of the divide stood those whose historical memory was rooted in the economic emergency of the Depression and the tragedy of Munich. These liberals hoped to sustain the New Deal coalition through appeals to economic self-interest and vigilant anti-Communism. On the other side stood younger Democrats whose perceptions were shaped by postwar affluence and the 'lessons of Vietnam.' "
The younger Democrats heading the ticket in 1992 are obviously aware of these differences. In the years after 1968, the author notes, the problems confronting the Democratic party transcended the limitations of any candidate, including Mr. Mondale. The emergence of controversial social issues -- crime and the death penalty, abortion, school prayer, gay rights and the rights of minorities -- eroded support for traditional Democratic appeals to economic self-interest.
Battle lines shifted in recent Presidential campaigns, but Mr. Mondale and later Democratic candidates found themselves holding defensive positions. The Republicans "successfully defined the debate over these issues as a clash between the insurgent values of a liberal elite and the traditional values of middle-class Americans," the author writes. "This new conservative populism has replaced contempt for greedy businessmen with a disdain for liberal judges, unresponsive bureaucrats and arrogant minorities."
At least since the time of President Lyndon B. Johnson, who was so effective in pushing civil rights laws through Congress, no issue has been more explosive than race. Through the use of code words and television symbols, the race card was played by Vice President George Bush to help defeat Gov. Michael S. Dukakis in the last election. The race issue has been stilled momentarily, but it is doubtful that it has disappeared in the '92 campaign. On race, Mr. Gillon provides historical perspective.
"As the national Democratic Party became identified with the civil rights struggles, the white South as well as many urban ethnics in the Northeast and Midwest moved comfortably into Republican hands," he writes. "Many of these voters no longer viewed the Democratic party as a vehicle for advancing the economic well-being of all Americans, but as a hostage of its black constituents. The party's support for controversial policies such as affirmative action and busing, the growing visibility of 'threatening' leaders such as Jesse Jackson and fears about the emergence of a 'black underclass,' have fed old racial stereotypes and further divided the races. Race is the prism through which many of the new social issues are filtered."
The liberal legacy, which sustained Democrats in the Roosevelt, Truman, Kennedy and Johnson Administrations until the Vietnam War divided the country, is now undergoing a redefinition. Walter Mondale and the Democratic Party had to struggle with a dilemma: how to keep the party's liberal traditions while attracting conservative and independent voters. "Democrats must articulate a single compelling vision," Mr. Gillon advises, "that energizes middle-class America without abandoning the concerns of its marginalized constituencies."
That familiar notion is why the L word has been put on hold until Election Day, and possibly afterward. If not as poetically, the Democratic script now seems to follow the line in "The Second Coming" by Yeats: that unless the center holds, things will fall apart, the ceremony of innocence will drown and the party will go slouching toward the White House, its ideals in disarray.

The Vicar of Bray

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

DATELINE: HOUSTON

 BODY:
Would George Bush really provoke a confrontation with Iraq so American bombs fall on Baghdad in the week of the Republican Convention?
The story, reported by Patrick E. Tyler in The New York Times, suggests a use of Presidential power so cynical that it makes one gasp. But George Bush is the man who said he would "do what I have to do to be re-elected." And he is the man who in a lifetime of politics has traded every value he may ever have had for the sake of office. 
 The perception that there is no bottom line in this President is what I believe explains his decline. In the hollowness is the collapse.
His abandonment of principle in order to get ahead is commonly traced to his nomination for Vice President in 1980. In 1970, campaigning for the Senate, he had said that "women should have the freedom to choose or not to choose an abortion." On the Reagan ticket in 1980, he became a fervent opponent of abortion.
But the process of shedding principle had begun much earlier. Garry Wills traced the history brilliantly in The New York Review of Books dated Aug. 13, in a piece entitled "The Hostage."
Mr. Bush began in politics in the Texas Republican Party of the 1960's -- a party, Mr. Wills points out, that was dominated by the extreme right. So when Mr. Bush first ran for the Senate, in 1964, he opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and refused to repudiate the crazies of the John Birch Society.
Afterward he said he was ashamed of "not speaking out." He told his minister, John Stevens, "You know, John, I took some of the far-right positions to get elected. I hope I never do it again."
But he did. To get on the Reagan ticket he swallowed what he had called "voodoo economics," and he embraced the social agenda of the religious right. He told Jerry Falwell that he had been born again.
As President he has continued his ardent courtship of the right. He even vetoed a bill to set up a desperately needed fetal-tissue bank for research on such grave illnesses as Parkinson's disease. He said the bill would encourage abortions, though its terms forbade abortions to provide research material.
All politicians have to compromise. Most engage in a degree of hypocrisy from time to time. But Mr. Bush has made cynicism a way of life.
When he nominated Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court, he said that of all possible candidates in the country Judge Thomas was "the best qualified." No one even thought of believing that absurdity. Conservatives were told that Judge Thomas would be a sure vote against abortion, as he has proved to be.
The television advertising he has used in the run-up to the convention is an example of cynicism so unembarrassed that it could be called debonair.
"We must strengthen the American family," Mr. Bush told voters in one of the spot ads. That from the President who vetoed the most important pro-family legislation of our age, the bill that would require large companies to give employees unpaid family and medical leave.
"We must increase respect for the law," he said. That from a man who for 12 years has been part of two of the most lawless Administrations in American history.
For all his currying of the right, conservatives have never trusted him. And so he seeks evermore pathetically to prove that he is one of them.
Perhaps, somewhere deep inside, there still is a real George Bush with humane values. We are invited to believe so when his wife opposes the Republican platform's call for a total, constitutional ban on abortion. But by all signs a lifetime of political cynicism has made him like the subject of that satirical English verse "The Vicar of Bray," a minister who adjusts his faith to political demands.
The verse is said to be based on a real vicar of the village of Bray, Symon Symonds, who served under Henry VIII, Edward VI, Bloody Mary and Elizabeth. He was twice a Catholic, twice a Protestant. Tasked with his switches, he said: "If I changed my religion, I am sure I kept true to my principle, which is to live and die the Vicar of Bray."

HEADLINE: How Government Mismanaged Public Housing

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Volatile Mix in Housing: Elderly and Mentally Ill" (front page, Aug. 3): The problem is not limited only to public housing since similar admission requirements pertain to "publicly assisted housing" (Section 236 and other Housing and Urban Development supervised programs). 
 The philosophy of public housing, and to a lesser extent, publicly assisted housing, has been transformed from one of creating viable housing communities by admitting only people and families who can live in large developments in harmony with their neighbors to one of housing people and families who require intensive social supervision -- and failing to provide such remedial help to any meaningful extent.
The original housing philosophy of "enlightened management" espoused by the English social worker Octavia Hill and adopted by early housing authorities has given way to housing anyone who needs it without regard to either the present inhabitants or the new tenants.
Early housing reformers somewhat naively felt that the mere process of moving slum dwellers into well-planned new housing would help cure them of social ills. But it was soon discovered that good housing alone was not the answer. Good management, social services, recreational facilities, day-care centers, adult-education classes and a host of other services to show the residents that management cared about their well-being were needed as well.
Unfortunately, housing philosophy is reverting to the "good housing alone" theory as militant advocacy groups, wanting to do the best for clients, fail to consider the needs of present residents.
Americans have an enormous financial investment in both public housing and publicly assisted housing. When the famous Pruitt-Igoe public housing project in St. Louis was blown up years ago because it had become unmanageable, it was former law-abiding residents and potential applicants who had their dreams deferred who lost out.
It seems obvious that one cannot expect leadership from H.U.D. or state and local housing agencies. H.U.D. is mostly to blame since it controls enormous housing subsidies, but cannot formulate housing policies that will not impair residents' quality of life, preserve the housing stock and provide good housing for the mentally disabled, homeless and other needy people and families.
The old housing philosophers, no longer with us, have been replaced by shortsighted bureaucrats who will do their best to destroy one of America's great social experiments -- affordable housing -- and in the process impose an enormous financial burden on us.

HEADLINE: PARTY IN THE SPOTLIGHT;
After a Long Ascendancy, G.O.P. Seems to Falter

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Aug. 16

 BODY:
It is more than a quarter of a century now since the Republicans hit bottom with the humiliation of Barry Goldwater and people began saying they might never win another Presidential election.
Instead, the party of Lincoln has staged one of its greatest runs, piling up five victories while losing the White House only once, and then only when one of its members became the first President to resign. Until a few months ago, Republicans seemed so invulnerable that some experts were saying the Democrats might never win another Presidential election. 
 But as Republicans trooped into Houston this weekend to renominate George Bush, there were signs that their glory days might be numbered. The building blocks of their ascendancy, anti-Communism and social issues, no longer control the agenda, and Mr. Bush and his strategists appear unsure about what they can do to compensate.
 
Some Traditional Talismans
 Politics is cyclical, especially Presidential politics. Thirty years in power followed by thirty years in the wilderness is the usual formula, according to Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., the historian, though it is seldom so exact. The weakening of party loyalties may have somewhat truncated the pattern, and the Republican string may be running out after only 25 years.
Republicans cling to traditional talismans. Modern incumbents do not lose unless some cataclysmic event (the Depression, Watergate, the Iran hostage crisis) disrupts their term. Candidates do not usually win on their first try for the Presidency, nor do candidates from small states like Arkansas often manage to prevail (not since Franklin Pierce of New Hampshire, anyway). And since the New Hampshire primary was instituted, no one has been elected President who did not first win that state's primary. Bill Clinton came in second.
But the brakes of history seem to be working against Mr. Bush and his party. The Republicans seem to be losing momentum, the same way the New Deal/Fair Deal/New Frontier/Great Society did after four victories by Franklin D. Roosevelt and one each by Harry S. Truman, John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson.
 
From Swords to Plowshares
 The end of the cold war has robbed the President's party of one of its mightiest swords. The nation came to see the containment of Communism as the business of Republicans, though that was always a little bit unfair, since the basic doctrine had been formulated in the Truman Administration by Dean Acheson and others. Republicans were seen as tougher, steadier and more trustworthy in an era when "standing up to the Russians" was a major preoccupation -- some would say a fixation -- of the United States.
Now it is the Republicans who feel hard done by. Having won the cold war, as they see it, they get no credit for it, as Mr. Bush has repeatedly and rather incredulously complained. Not only that; the voters turn their attention elsewhere, refocusing on the kinds of domestic issues that have always suited the Democrats.
This fundamental shift has taken place at a time of economic stringency, which helped the Democrats even when foreign policy problems and emphasis on social issues eventually enabled the Republicans to triumph. In 1968, for example, Hubert H. Humphrey almost caught Richard M. Nixon, despite the crushing unpopularity of Johnson and the Vietnam War, by talking of nothing but what Mr. Humphrey called "lunch bucket issues" in the final weeks.
On economic grounds, Mr. Bush is more vulnerable than most Presidents, who usually manage the economy so as to make recoveries coincide with Election Day. The President says the recovery has been under way for months, but it is so feeble that few voters have noticed it. Staggering under the burden of the lowest growth rate since Herbert Hoover, Mr. Bush enters the convention with only about a third of the electorate viewing him favorably and with about three-fourths saying the country is on the wrong track.
 
Focus on Economic Weakness
 The fear of national decline now centers not on Communist encroachment or subversion, but on economic weakness, exacerbated by poor education.
Desperate, convinced that Mr. Bush kicked away much of his credibility by raising taxes, some conservatives like Jack F. Kemp, the Housing Secretary, are pressing for renewed tax cuts, and the President may accommodate them. Other conservatives worry more about cutting the massive deficit. Some preach the virtue of free trade, others the peril of losing jobs to Mexico.
The suspicion grows that the Republican coalition is coming apart, as did Roosevelt's alliance of segregationists and blacks, labor skates and urban bosses. Like most coalitions, the Republican alliance has always seemed a bit weird, with its combination of country clubbers, big-city ethnic Democrats and religious fundamentalists; like most coalitions, it was always too unstable to last.
More than anything else, it was the social issues that made possible the union of Archie Bunker and Jerry Falwell and the town banker and doctor -- things like busing, sexual license, crime in the streets, recreational drugs and long hair. Those issues are not dead yet; the Texas Republicans are convinced that they can beat Mr. Clinton mainly on gun control and the support he has won from homosexuals.
 
Contortions Over Abortion
 But if they are not dead, the social issues are relatively dormant. The major exception is abortion, the cornerstone of the Republicans' "family values" theme for 1992, but it causes the party serious problems. The reasons were on display last week in the contortions Mr. Bush and his wife, Barbara, went through as the convention moved toward a hard-line platform plank on the subject.
The fundamentalists and allies like Phyllis Schlafly, the Illinois publicist for conservative social causes, were thrilled with the platform. Martin Mawyer, president of the Christian Action Network, called it "written evidence that the religious right is alive, well and active."
But many of the more traditional Republicans, including many of the Bushes' social friends, are outraged by the platform's utter rejection of abortion in any circumstances. And many of the Reagan Democrats are far more concerned about jobs than abortions. In Macomb County, north of Detroit, the epitome of Middle American defection from the Democrats for 25 years, the polls and the politicians say that many of the defectors are coming home.
It is conservatives who have always been most suspicious of Mr. Bush, and some of their spokesmen, including Richard Viguerie, the fund-raiser, even called upon him to step down. But as Kevin Phillips, the political analyst who first described the emerging Republican majority, noted the other day, "There's widespread discontent in the middle, too, not only on abortion, but supply-side economics and trade and the issue of decline."
 
Closer to the Democrats
 The centrists, the independents and the ticket-splitters count as much as ever. In The New York Times/CBS News Poll taken this month, 28 percent of the voters described themselves as Republicans, compared to 33 percent who called themselves Democrats. And of the self-described independents (33 percent), almost half said they thought of themselves as closer to the Democrats than the Republicans.
Unless the convention and what follows it can produce another of the stunning reversals that have marked this year, those figures mean trouble not only for Mr. Bush but also for his party; they threaten to cancel out the advantages in Congressional elections that Republicans thought they had gained from reapportionment, which has switched seats toward the Sun Belt states, and from public anger with the Democratic-controlled Congress.
Mr. Bush has been appealing for an end to divided government. As the convention begins, the President has an opportunity to change people's minds the way Mr. Clinton did in New York last month. The danger for the Republicans is that the country will heed Mr. Bush's message by electing Mr. Clinton in November and returning the Democrats to their accustomed places on Capitol Hill.

And of the self-described independents (33 percent), almost half said they thought of themselves as closer to the Democrats than the Republicans.
Unless the convention and what follows it can produce another of the stunning reversals that have marked this year, those figures mean trouble not only for Mr. Bush but also for his party; they threaten to cancel out the advantages in Congressional elections that Republicans thought they had gained from reapportionment, which has switched seats toward the Sun Belt states, and from public anger with the Democratic-controlled Congress.
Mr. Bush has been appealing for an end to divided government. As the convention begins, the President has an opportunity to change people's minds the way Mr. Clinton did in New York last month. The danger for the Republicans is that the country will heed Mr. Bush's message by electing Mr. Clinton in November and returning the Democrats to their accustomed places on Capitol Hill.

BUSH VOWS A TOUGH CAMPAIGN AS G.O.P. OPENS ITS CONVENTION

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Aug. 17

 BODY:
President Bush roared into his convention city tonight with a vow to revive his lagging re-election campaign, and Ronald Reagan bestowed his blessing as an anxious Republican National Convention began a search for its old electoral magic.
At a rally near the Astrodome, Mr. Bush delivered a rousing attack on his Democratic opponents that suggested a bruising, hard-fought fall. "For the next 78 days, we're going to go out and ask the people of America to answer a very simple question: Who do you trust to do what's right for the United States of America?" 
 Mr. Reagan, speaking in the Astrodome, asserted that the nation needed Mr. Bush to continue the work of insuring peace abroad and conservative reforms at home. "A lot of liberal Democrats are saying it's time for a change, and they're right," declared Mr. Reagan, who rode to power with a similar call 12 years ago. "The only trouble is they're pointing to the wrong end of Pennsylvania Avenue." [Excerpts from Mr. Bush's and Mr. Reagan's remarks, page A8.]
 
Reagan's Long Memory
 As if to underscore his support for a successor still struggling to secure the conservative base, Mr. Reagan declared, "I warmly, genuinely, wholeheartedly support the re-election of George Bush as President of the United States." The 81-year-old Mr. Reagan rocked the convention with a vintage display of his oratorical skills and a precisely timed series of jokes about his age and the Democrats.
"This fellow they've nominated claims he's the new Thomas Jefferson," Mr. Reagan said. "Well, let me tell you something. I knew Thomas Jefferson. He was a friend of mine. And Governor, you're no Thomas Jefferson." Mr. Reagan was playfully alluding to a barb Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas hurled at Dan Quayle in a Vice-Presidential debate in 1988.
Mr. Reagan capped an evening that Republicans hoped would galvanize the party's base, raise serious doubts about Gov. Bill Clinton, and remind voters of the optimism of the Reagan years and Mr. Bush's connection to it. At the end of the speech, Mr. Reagan summoned his wife, Nancy, to the stage for a nostalgic tableau of the 1980's: Mr. Reagan with a cocky smile, Mrs. Reagan in a red dress, a cascade of balloons and a cheering crowd.
 
Conservative Call to Arms
 Mr. Bush received another blessing from a former rival, Patrick J. Buchanan, who won repeated cheers with a full-throated defense of the 1980's and a conservative call to arms.
The Republicans began their 35th national convention by approving a platform that reaffirms the party's implacable opposition to legalized abortion and support for a constitutional amendment that would outlaw it. It marked the official end of a struggle by supporters of abortion rights to buck their President and ease their party's stance, but the dissension simmered nonetheless.
Many delegates here talked openly of their disagreement with the party's abortion plank, but the Bush campaign was in firm control of the proceedings and averted a floor fight on the issue. Mr. Bush said today in an interview broadcast by CNN that he was "unashamedly pro-life."
But Mary Dent Crisp, the chairwoman of the National Republican Coalition for Choice, asserted, "The men in power have won a short-term battle, but the ultimate battle -- the November election -- is still ahead."
Republicans filled the opening session of their their four-day convention with predictions of a powerful Bush comeback and chants of "four more years." Mr. Bush and Vice President Quayle appeared together at an ebullient rally in an arena adjoining the Astrodome, with Mr. Bush delivering a speech that amounted to a convention kickoff.
"For nine months, the other side has had a one-way conversation with the American people," Mr. Bush declared. "And now it's our turn."
He added that after reading recent interviews with Mr. Clinton, he "half-expected, when I went over to the Oval Office, to find him over there measuring the drapes." The President, in a spirited performance clearly intended to signal a rejuvenated campaign, declared, "I'm a fighter."
He added: "Let me say, as the first shot out of the barrel -- put those drapes on hold. It's going to be curtains time for that ticket."
 
Another War to Win
 Mr. Quayle sounded another theme for this carefully scripted week: "Our President won the cold war. Let's give him a new Congress and let him win the domestic war."
Mr. Clinton came under heavy fire from an array of Republican speakers today, who accused him of being a failed Governor, a secret taxer and spender, a man who sought to avoid the draft, and a leader utterly unequipped to conduct American foreign policy.
The news media came under a carefully coordinated attack as well, with numerous Republicans portraying journalists as irredeemably biased in favor of Mr. Clinton. "Bill Clinton, who's suddenly become the darling of the news media, Mr. Wonderful," scoffed Richard N. Bond, the Republican national chairman, in his speech to the convention's morning session.
But the real business of this convention was regaining control of a Presidential campaign in which Mr. Bush lags behind Mr. Clinton by 17 percentage points in the latest New York Times CBS/News Poll. To do that, Republicans are trying to remind their national television audience of the achievements and qualities that once sent Mr. Bush skyrocketing in the polls.
The Republicans used much of their opening day to highlight Mr. Bush's record in foreign policy, casting the Reagan-Bush years as an era of strength and fortitude that helped end the cold war. Bush campaign strategists say that while voters are now consumed with domestic policy, the role and responsibilities of Commander in Chief will eventually be important factors in their decision.
Today, several speakers talked of the risk of turning American foreign policy over to a Governor from Arkansas. "He is inexperienced, unprepared and unlikely to build soundly on the foundation so carefully laid by Ronald Reagan and George Bush over the past 12 years," said Senator Richard Lugar of Indiana, a senior Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
Mr. Quayle, at a forum this afternoon sponsored by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, echoed the attack. "Bill Clinton's foreign policy experience is a summer internship with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee," Mr. Quayle said. "In the area of foreign policy, we ought to compare the experience of Bill Clinton with the experience of George Bush, and it is no comparison at all."
The Republicans were also trying to conclude some leftover business from the primaries. Mr. Buchanan, the conservative commentator who proved a troublesome challenger to Mr. Bush in the New Hampshire Primary, delivered an endorsement of his former rival tonight and a biting attack on Mr. Clinton that hinted of the commentator's 1996 potential.
 
Hillary Clinton Assailed
 "The American people are not going to buy back into the failed liberalism of the 1960's and 1970's, no matter how slick the package in 1992," Mr. Buchanan said. Denouncing the Democratic candidate's wife, Hillary Clinton, as a champion of "radical feminism," Mr. Buchanan asserted tht "Clinton & Clinton" would impose a far-left agenda on the nation.
Mr. Buchanan also raised the issue of Mr. Clinton's draft record, which many Republicans say could be damaging to the Governor in the South. Alluding to Mr. Bush's war record as a Navy pilot, Mr. Buchanan added scornfully, "When Bill Clinton's time came in Vietnam, he sat up in a dormitory in Oxford, England, and figured out how to dodge the draft."
Mr. Clinton has repeatedly denied that he sought to avoid serving during Vietnam, although he has conceded that he changed his mind about joining the Reserve Officers Training Corps when it became clear that his number would probably not be called in the draft lottery.
The Republicans quickly approved a platform that delighted the party's conservative wing: an impassioned endorsement of restricted government, free enterprise, and a social agenda that ranges from opposition to gun control to support for tuition subsidies for private and religious schools.
 
One Endorsement Withheld
 The approval went smoothly, after a final but futile flurry of activity by abortion-rights supporters. But the delicacy of the issue was apparent. Even as he reiterated his anti-abortion stance, Mr. Bush told CNN, "There are a lot of other things that people care about."
Ms. Crisp said the coalition for choice would not make an endorsement in the Presidential election this year.
By nightfall another drama had begun: Mr. Bush arrived for what many Republicans acknowledge is a make-or-break week for his lagging campaign. At the evening rally, shortly after Air Force One touched down at Ellington Field, Mr. Bush did what Republicans have urged him to do for months. He attacked Mr. Clinton and his running mate, Senator Al Gore of Tennessee, harshly and by name.
"They've called our great country a mockery and sounded the saxophone of change," Mr. Bush scoffed. "Don't kid yourself -- they'll say anything, anything to get elected. Say one thing in one place and whisper another in another."
Mr. Bush's speech, inside an arena packed with supporters punching the air with their signs and filling the night with their chants and cowbells, clearly energized a group that has longed for a more aggressive campaign. "Dy-no-mite!" said Gloria Olson, a delegate from Bismarck, N.D. "I was fired up. That's what we want -- we want him to come out fighting."

HEADLINE: PACT ON GARBAGE IN NEW YORK CITY

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SPECTER

 BODY:
The Dinkins administration and the leadership of the City Council have agreed to go ahead with construction of a $550 million incinerator at the Brooklyn Navy Yard and at the same time accelerate New York City's recycling program.
The two elements are at the core of a compromise to deal with the city's growing problem of garbage disposal -- a subject that has caused a long and bitter debate. 
 With the city's last landfill nearing capacity, most neighborhood and environmental groups have opposed more incineration and demanded more recycling. The agreement would increase recycling, but in conjunction with building the incinerator, which city and state garbage experts say is necessary for New York City to handle all its trash.
 
Significant Revisions
 The compromise still faces a review by the full City Council next week and may yet undergo significant revisions. Only last month, a majority of the Council members opposed another plan that also included building the incinerator but contained a far slower timetable on increasing recycling.
Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone said through a spokesman yesterday that the deal with the Mayor could resolve the long dispute. To get the incinerator built, the city has agreed to introduce citywide curbside recycling programs by the fall of 1993, one year earlier than planned. The city will also close two smaller incinerators it had planned to renovate, and it will export the toxic ash from the Navy Yard instead of dumping it on Staten Island.
It is too early to gauge the costs of the agreement. By eliminating instead of renovating incinerators Greenpoint, Brooklyn, and Maspeth, Queens, the city will save $200 million. But by accelerating the recycling program, which will mean building new plants throughout the city to separate and process plastics, glass, paper and newsprint, the city may spend as much as it saves or more.
 
Awaiting Council Action
 Many opponents of the new incinerator emphasized yesterday that the compromise plan did not yet have the blessing of the full Council.
In fact, the Council's most important voice on environmental matters, Stanley E. Michaels, who is chairman of the Environmental Protection Committee, did not participate in the negotiations. He has been on vacation in Australia. Only a month ago, he stood on the steps of City Hall and declared that without major revisions, the Sanitation Department's plan for the city's garbage would never pass.
But the lobbying since then has been as fierce as at any time in the decade since the project was first proposed. The city is required by state law to produce a waste management plan and the state Environmental Commissioner, Thomas C. Jorling, has been harsh in his warnings to council members -- both in public and private -- about what would happen if it ignores the city's looming garbage problems.
"I am not going to state a position on whether or not the incinerator should be built," Mr. Jorling said in an interview last month, in part because he cannot encourage or discourage a plant that he will have to approve. "But clearly the city of New York is going to need every avenue open to it if it wants to manage its waste properly."
 
Solid Waste Capital
 In 1989 Mr. Dinkins campaigned against immediate construction of the incinerator. In the past two years, however, he has become a quiet, yet firm, supporter of the plant.
No city generates more waste each day than New York. Currently, the city recycles less than 10 percent of its residential waste and burns slightly more than 10 percent of its 28,000 daily tons refuse. Almost all the remainder is taken to the world's largest landfill, Fresh Kills on Staten Island. But the landfill's life will end within 10 to 20 years, and Congress now permits states to prevent the export of garbage. The only options left to the city are to burn or recycle its trash.
Here and elsewhere across the country, recycling has been seen as ecologically friendly, and incinerators have rapidly become an avenue that is almost impossible to pursue. They are hated by many local residents who detest the way they look and fear the pollutants they spew into the atmosphere. Although the Navy Yard would be constructed as one of the nation's most advanced such plants, which many experts say pose few if any health threats, not many area residents have been eager to see it built.
Rabbi David Niederman, head of the United Jewish Organizations of Williamsburg, the neighborhood where the Navy Yard is located, vowed last night to continue the group's six-year opposition to the incinerator.
 
Doubts About Incinerator
 "No matter what compromise the City Council and the Mayor will agree on, we will make sure that a health hazard like this incinerator will not be built," he said. "This is not a done deal at all. It's a done plan, but not a done deal."
Many environmentalists yesterday continued to question the value of building a new incinerator.
"We have always said that recycling has to work first before we would be able to examine the possibility of any new incinerator," said Eric A. Goldstein, a senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, and a leader of the effort to increase the paltry rate of recycling in the city.
Mr. Goldstein and other opponents of the Navy Yard incinerator have long contended that as long as the city can spend hundreds of millions of dollars to burn its garbage it would not be making recycling its first priority. "We don't have any of the details about how much recycling they are talking about or how it will be introduced. What we do know is that this would get the nose under the tent for a giant network of garbage burning incinerators in New York."
 
Political Will
 But city officials disagree. They concede that recycling in the city has failed so far largely because there has never been the money or political will to make it work. But they say that once curbside recycling spreads throughout the city it will be easier to direct education and information programs that work.
'We have been trying so hard to develop a plan that responds to the concerns we heard at the hearings," said Andrew Lynn, the Sanitation Department's assistant commissioner for the new Solid Waste Management Plan. At hearings throughout the city this spring, two facts became clear: New Yorkers want more recycling, and they want to burn less garbage.
"We are going on line as quickly as we can with as much as we can," he said. "And we have the highest hopes for the recycling program."

HEADLINE: New York Reviving Quota Regulations For Minority Firms

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
Armed with a new study that shows minority-owned businesses still get a relatively small share of state contracts, New York State is resurrecting a program that requires contractors to reserve a certain proportion of state work for companies headed by women and members of minority groups, state officials said.
In effect, the state is returning to a program it suspended in 1989 after the United States Supreme Court ruled that a similar program in Virginia violated the constitutional rights of white contractors to equal protection under the law. The court left open the possibility that local governments could restore the programs if they compiled evidence of discrimination.
 
Voluntary Compliance
 New York State officials say the new study demonstrates a pattern of discrimination based on statistics. It also includes the testimony of minority contractors who say they are excluded from the process. 
 The Supreme Court ruling, in City of Richmond v. Croson, voided a local law that mandated 30 percent of the value of all city construction contracts go to companies owned by women and members of minority groups. It has forced a string of local governments to dismantle such programs.
Since the ruling, New York State has asked contractors to voluntarily abide by its goals, which vary from agency to agency. But a result, according to the study, has been that the amount of contracts going to women and minority-group members dropped sharply.
Under New York's resurrected program, all contracts will still go to the lowest responsible bidder without regard to race or sex. But the prime contractors will be required to insure that a slice of the contract goes to minority- and female-owned companies. If the contractor fails to comply, the state can cancel the contract.
For instance, the State Parks Department asks contractors to try to give 12 percent of its subcontracting to minority-owned companies and 5 percent to female-owned companies, but it cannot punish them for not doing so. Those goals will become mandatory again once the regulations are put in place, state Economic Development officials said.
Many details of the system are yet to be worked out. State officials denied that the program amounted to a quota system but they said that when the new regulations are published in three weeks, each state agency will begin requiring contractors to channel a percentage of the work to minority- and female-owned companies. Those percentages will be decided ultimately by the state Economic Development Corporation based on how many minority- and female-owned companies are available in any given field. Such companies are defined as ones in which women or members of minority groups have a controlling interest and exercise independent control over all business decisions.
The rules will apply to about $4.8 billion worth of contracts that the state solicits competitive bids for every year, from bridge repairs, to highway construction, to printing contracts, to hospital supplies.
New York is one of about 65 cities, counties and states that have finished or are conducting exhaustive studies to justify restoring their programs. Last February, New York City released a similar study when Mayor David N. Dinkins announced a broad policy initiative to insure that a fifth of city contracts go to minority-owned companies.
Minority-owned business groups praised the state's decision yesterday, saying the studies spawned by the Croson decision had revealed widespread inequities. "It's the only way minorities will be given a fair opportunity to participate," said Anthony W. Robinson, president of the Minority Business Enterprise Legal Defense and Education Fund in Washington.
Harriet R. Michel, president of the National Minority Suppliers Development Council, said it was sad the state had to do an expensive study just to ratify what officials believed was necessary three years ago.
"Now they are going back to square one to do what they did voluntarily in the first place," Ms. Michel said. "It's nuts."
Contractors said they doubted the study would withstand the legal challenges that would surely come from white contractors. Michael Kennedy, special counsel for the Association of General Contractors of America, said the Supreme Court ruling set up an "extremely high standard" similar to the standard applied since the 1940's to strike down programs that discriminate against members of minority groups.
"Whether any of these studies will stand up to legal scrutiny, no one knows," Mr. Kennedy said. "It's my view that the Supreme Court did not intend the Croson case to provide grounds on how a jurisdiction could justify one of these programs."
The Supreme Court ruling placed a heavy burden on the local government to prove minority-owned businesses had been discriminated against, saying such programs could only be justified if they served the "compelling state interest" of redressing "identified discrimination."
New York State officials believe they have amassed enough evidence of discrimination to stave off legal challenges under the Croson decision.
The study, which will be released Wednesday, shows that while businesses owned by members of minority groups and women make up nearly 25 percent of the bidders on state contracts, they get 7.9 percent of the $4.8 billion the state spends each year. The premise of the study is that the amount of money that goes to minority businesses in a particular field should be comparable to the proportion of the minority businesses in that field.
Some contractors questioned yesterday whether the statistics were valid. It was unclear, they said, whether the study took into account the size of companies bidding, their qualifications and the number of minority-owned companies bidding on the same contracts.
The study analyzed all state contracts for construction, goods and services in fiscal years 1990 and 1991, and includes the following findings:
*Female-owned businesses received only 19 percent of the contract dollars that state officials said they should receive given their numbers. Black businesses received 32 cents on the dollar and Hispanic businesses garnered about 36 cents.
*Only 1.2 percent of state contracts were awarded directly to minority-owned businesses and 1 percent went to companies headed by women. The majority of the contracts to such companies were subcontracts.
*In hearings held throughout the state, about 250 witnesses testified to problems ranging from discrimination in getting credit to racial discrimination by Government officials. "The testimony was compelling and even chilling in revealing the depth and malice of that discrimination," the report said.
In the fall of 1989 and spring of 1990, when the regulations were mandatory, 7.7 percent of state contract dollars went to minority business enterprises and 4.4 to women. In the following budget year, when the goals became voluntary, those levels dropped to 5.5 percent for members of minority groups, and 2.4 percent for women.

HEADLINE: Cambodia Pact Founders on Attacks and Distrust

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHNOM PENH, Cambodia, Aug. 11

 BODY:
Nearly a year after the United Nations brokered a peace accord intended to end Cambodia's decades of bloodshed and terror, the settlement is under threat of collapse because of the refusal of the Khmer Rouge to disarm their tens of thousands of rebel soldiers.
Some diplomats and Cambodians remain hopeful that the Maoist-inspired Khmer Rouge will begin at least a partial disarmament in time for elections next spring, but no one can be certain of the intentions of the secretive group. 
 In Phnom Penh, which has become a chaotic boom town with the arrival of more than 18,000 United Nations peacekeeping troops and civilian workers, there is a debate over what should be done if the Khmer Rouge remain obstinate and do not disarm. The alternatives include using armed United Nations troops to force the Khmer Rouge to cooperate.
The Khmer Rouge controlled the government in the 1970's and directed a "peasant revolution," a radical restructuring of Cambodian society. Estimates of the number of Cambodians who died range from hundreds of thousands to more than one million.
One of four warring factions that signed the peace accord, the Khmer Rouge have issued a set of demands intended to strengthen their hand in the elections and to dismantle the current Vietnamese-installed Government.
During a visit to Phnom Penh this month, the United States representative to the United Nations, Edward J. Perkins, said in an interview that "I'm more hopeful than not hopeful" about the prospects for peace. "Of course," he added, "I don't know what is on the mind of the Khmer Rouge."
Diplomats say any grounds for hope lies in the expectation that the Khmer Rouge will determine, on the basis of a cold calcuation of the facts and nothing else, that they must return to the peace process and begin to demobilize. According to this reasoning, Khmer Rouge leaders would otherwise risk being abandoned by their remaining allies, most importantly the Chinese Government and the Thai military, and giving up whatever international legitimacy they have secured through the peace settlement.
Even if the current stalemate is resolved with the Khmer Rouge, however, diplomats and many Cambodians agree that the peace process is almost certain to bog down again and again as the Khmer Rouge and other factions demand new concessions.
It is impossible to find anyone here who believes that the guerrillas of the Khmer Rouge will ever simply lay down their arms and disappear into the jungle, even if their leaders do agree to rejoin the peace process this year.
 
A Sense of Relief
 Despite so many dire predictions about Cambodia's future, the presence of the large United Nations force has produced in many Cambodians a sense of relief, even of opportunity, that they had never experienced.
There have been repeated cease-fire violations in recent months by the Khmer Rouge, including shooting attacks on United Nations helicopters flying over their territory, but military observers describe the Cambodian countryside as generally peaceful.
Taking advantage of what many acknowledge could be only an intermission in the civil war, foreign investors and wealthy Cambodians have created the fastest-growing if most chaotic and speculative economy in Southeast Asia.
Even as most of its residents continue to live in utter poverty, Phnom Penh, like provincial capitals elsewhere in Cambodia, is now one big construction site, with hotels, restaurants and office buildings under construction or renovation.
For a visitor who knows of Phnom Penh only as the city from which the Khmer Rouge directed their campaign to return Cambodia to "Year Zero," the effect of a downtown stroll can be jarring.
Newsstands have begun selling fresh copies of glossy Western magazines, and there are two new English-language newspapers in the capital, The Phnom Penh Post and The Cambodia Times. Stores are stocked with yogurt and cheese from Thailand and crisp red apples from Washington State.
Singaporean investors can be found thrashing out business deals over espresso in a pricey new French bistro that picked up and moved here, staff and all, from Bangkok, Thailand.
The owners of Cambodia's new international airline have enough confidence in the future that they have leased an American jet and hired an experienced Icelandic crew. The phones are working properly for the first time in years.
The question bedeviling diplomats, foreign business people and many Cambodians is: Can the United Nations pull out of Cambodia on schedule next year, even if the Khmer Rouge agree to return to the peace process?
The United Nations, it is feared, will be marooned here. Without the presence of the peacekeeping force, many here argue, the hard-won peace will collapse as Cambodians, many of whom have known only battle or genocidal terror in their lifetimes, find themselves unable to manage a government.
Sawn Van Thay, a 39-year-old tailor whose shop is just off Achar Mean Boulevard, the capital's congested central thoroughfare, offers a hope common among Cambodians: He wants the United Nations to remain here for years.
"It must be here for 15, maybe 20 years, so we can raise and educate a generation of children who will capable of running a government," he said, his seamstress turning from her work to nod, frantically, in agreement.
 
Fear of War's Return
 "The Khmer Rouge killed all the people who had education," he said. "If the United Nations soldiers leave, we will go back to squabbling and then to war. The United Nations must stay many, many years."
That, United Nations officials insist, will not happen, especially with the Security Council now contemplating additional responsibilities in what used to be Yugoslavia.
"We are not here to solve all the problems of Cambodia," said Yasushi Akashi, the Japanese-born diplomat who is in charge of the United Nations operation in Cambodia, vowing that peacekeeping troops will not have a "perpetual presence" here.
He hedged, however, when asked whether the peacekeeping forces would be able to leave on schedule after elections next year.
"I will raise questions on the part of my colleagues in New York whatever answer I give you, so please excuse me," he said. "I hope so," is the best response that he can give for now.
The Khmer Rouge are taking part in the peace settlement hammered out by the United Nations. The nominal leader of the group is Khieu Samphan, a French-educated Cambodian economist, who is believed by diplomats to answer to Pol Pot, the shadowy founder of the Khmer Rouge.
Mr. Pol Pot, whose real name is Saloth Sar, has been in hiding for most of his adult life. He is said to move between Thailand and western Cambodia.
Unlike the army of the Vietnamese-installed Government and the other two rebel groups involved in the peace accord, the Khmer Rouge have so far refused to put down their arms and place their soldiers in United Nations-supervised camps, a process that was supposed to begin in June.
Khmer Rouge officials have said their troops will not disarm until more authority is taken away from the central Government and given to a neutral interim body and until there is proof that all Vietnamese troops have left Cambodia. The Vietnamese ousted the Khmer Rouge in an invasion that began in December 1978
 
Council Led by Sihanouk
 The neutral body, the Supreme National Council, is made up of representatives of all four factions in the peace settlement and is led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the nation's former monarch and its newly restored head of state.
One of Prince Sihanouk's sons, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, leads one of the other two rebel factions. The smallest faction, the Khmer People's National Liberation Front, is directed by former Prime Minister Son Sann.
The United Nations says that it has already done what it can to satisfy the demands of the Khmer Rouge.
Diplomats observing the peace process say they are heartened that China and Thailand, longtime patrons of the Khmer Rouge, have publicly demanded that the Khmer Rouge disarm. In an effort to exert pressure on the Khmer Rouge to cooperate with United Nations peacekeepers in Cambodia, a high-ranking Chinese official reportedly held a rare meeting in Bangkok last week with Mr. Pol Pot.
There is also excitement in diplomatic circles over reports of a consistent flow of deserters from the Khmer Rouge in recent weeks.
Still the Khmer Rouge appear to have remarkable staying power, thanks to vast stocks of weapons and to its control over gem-mining and logging areas near Cambodia's Western border. The gems and lumber produce tens of millions of dollars a year for the Khmer Rouge, most of it funneled through Thai businessmen who seem to care little about their Government's public efforts to isolate the rebels.
The peacekeeping operation in Cambodia is the largest in the history of the United Nations, with a budget approaching $2 billion and a staff drawn from more than 100 nations. There are about 15,100 soldiers, 2,100 police officers and 1,000 civilians.
 
A Comforting Sight
 Across the Cambodian countryside, the sight of United Nations soldiers and the blue United Nations flag has become familiar, and comforting, to many Cambodians.
"When they see us now, they always smile and welcome us," said Cpl. Salim Zakaria, a 25-year-old Malaysian policeman who now walks the beat in Phnom Penh.
Yet the arrival of the United Nations has plainly not been all good news to all Cambodians. The presence of so many free-spending foreigners -- many civilian United Nations workers have a living allowance well in excess of $100 a day -- has aggravated Cambodia's already serious inflation problem.
Although there is no sign of the starvation that once afflicted Cambodia, international relief organizations say malnutrition is a constant concern.
The price of rice, the staple of the diet, has more than doubled over the last year, to 55 cents a pound, equivalent to a day's wages for much of the population, which is about seven million.
 
Potato Shortages in capital
 There have been reports of potato shortages in Phnom Penh as foreigners buy up the crop for their own meals. Families of beggars wait patiently outside many of Phnom Penh's sparkling new restaurants and hotels.
"The foreigners complain about the prices of the food, but they always pay them," said Un Chanphalla, who runs a vegetable stand in Cambodia's central market. "The poor are not so lucky. They must go without."
While foreign businessmen are swarming into Phnom Penh, most of their investments are made in services industries -- banking, restaurants, hotels and the like -- and seem designed more to make a quick return on capital than to contribute to the economic development of Cambodia.
To a degree that startles many Cambodians, the United Nations is now administering much of the central Government, filling key posts at the Defense and Foreign Ministries, and in the national police.
Prime Minister Hun Sen and his deputies, installed by Vietnam after its 1978 invasion, remain in place, although increasingly they must work alongside United Nations officials, a requirement of the peace settlement.
 
A Daunting Assignment
 "The United Nations has never done anything like this before," said Gerard Porcell, an administrative-law judge from France who was recruited by the United Nations for a daunting assignment -- administering the Cambodian Government in advance of the election. "We cannot look over everyone's shoulder, but we are attempting to have control."
Although diplomats had feared that the Hun Sen Government would refuse to give up authority in sensitive ministries, Mr. Porcell has few public complaints of lack of cooperation by the Government, although in some ministries there was little left for the United Nations to run.
Outraged by corruption and by inadequate pay, experienced Government workers by the hundreds have fled for private business in recent months, leaving the Government to crumble from within.
"In some ministries, we have found almost nothing -- empty rooms," Mr. Porcell said, shaking his head. "That was true especially in the Ministry of Defense. There we found many empty rooms, many spiders and cobwebs."

HEADLINE: Dow Dips 4.05, to 3,324.89, in Light Trading

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stock prices finished mixed yesterday in light summer trading as investors took a cautious view ahead of the Republican convention.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 4.05 points, to 3,324.89. But advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by a ratio of 9 to 7 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 Volume on the Big Board was a low 152.8 million shares, down from 166.8 million in the Friday session.
Stocks were influenced somewhat by pessimism in the bond market over the potential for a bigger Federal deficit. Bond prices tumbled yesterday on fears that President Bush would have to act -- possibly during the convention in Houston -- to bolster the economy through a tax cut or lower interest rates, which would increase the deficit.
"It's hard to see him doing something dramatic that wouldn't affect the deficit, at least on a short-term basis," said Jeffrey Tabak, a principal in the firm of Miller Tabak Hirsch & Company.
Another bearish sign for stocks, Mr. Tabak said, was a high ratio of purchases of "call" options to buy securities at specific prices to "put" options to sell them, indicating that traders expect a market decline.
Some analysts expected stocks to get a lift from the start of the Republican convention. Investors generally favor Republican administrations, and disdain change. But the market was cautious because of Mr. Bush's continued weak standing in polls.
"The markets feel better when the guy in charge is strongly supported," said Richard Hoey, economist at the Dreyfus Corporation.
Airline stocks helped support the Dow average, influenced by a favorable article in Barron's magazine predicting the sector was ready for a rally. UAL gained 2, to 109 1/4; USAir rose 1/2, to 13 1/4, and Delta Air Lines gained 3/8, to 51 7/8.
Global Marine led the Big Board's most-active list, rising 1/8, to 2 1/4.
Among other actively traded issues on the New York Stock Exchange, Lowe's fell 5/8, to 18. The stock tumbled 4 3/8 on Friday after the retail chain reported earnings below analysts' expectations.
Citicorp, which said late Friday that it had to restate second-quarter earnings downward, fell 3/8, to 18 1/2.
On the Nasdaq market, Systemix tumbled 9 1/4, to 23 3/4, or 28 percent, after a Merrill Lynch analyst lowered his rating for the biotechnology company.
Also on the Nasdaq, American Biodyne rose 3 3/4, to 19 3/4, after announcing it will be acquired by Medco Containment Services in a $121 million stock deal. Medco fell 2, to 28 1/2.
The Big Board's composite index rose 0.54, to 231.60. On the American Stock Exchange, the market value index gained 0.12, to 386.94. The Nasdaq index fell 0.71, to 572.47.

HEADLINE: PARTY IN THE SPOTLIGHT: ON STAGE;
A Few Words, Texas-Style, Before 'the Rubber Hits the Road'

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Aug. 17

 BODY:
This Republican National Convention being deep in the heart of Texas, speakers on the first night of the party's nominating session were trying to outdo each other with clever, folksy metaphors and sayings.
Just about everyone tried their hand at it, even the delegates. One of the delegates loyal to Patrick J. Buchanan, Bill Dearing, a 28-year-old lawyer from Tennessee, said Mr. Buchanan's rivals for the mantle of conservative leadership had "sold out like a bunch of kennel-fed dogs." 
 But the clear master of the evening was Senator Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming, who has turned pungent soundbites into a cottage industry.
"This week," he said, "is where the rubber hits the road for our party."
Barely pausing to draw a breath, Mr. Simpson proclaimed that the Republicans would "blow away all this warm hazy stuff of summer with the cool crisp winds of fall" and the Democrats will "disappear like squash vines in the winter time."
And when the Republicans talk about Gov. Bill Clinton's draft record, Mr. Simpson said, the Democrats will "holler like a gut-shot panther."
 
Quick to Compare Military Records
 Indeed, Mr. Clinton's draft record seemed to be a favorite subject of the evening. Mr. Bush has said he wants his campaign to avoid the "sleaze" business, but tonight's speeches suggested that he draws the line at his opponent's family life. Other subjects, like the draft, are fair game.
The aim, apparently, was to remind the delegates that Mr. Clinton had joined an R.O.T.C. program and gone to study in England to remove himself from the draft, while Mr. Bush flew a Navy torpedo-bomber in World War II.
"When Mr. Clinton's turn came in Vietnam, he sat up in a dormitory in Oxford, England, and figured out how to dodge the draft," Mr. Buchanan said.
Mr. Simpson was even more direct. "We'll be talking about a man who quit school to go to fight for his country and a man who went to school to avoid fighting for it," he hollered.
It seemed that about the only politician here who was not talking about Mr. Clinton's draft record was Vice President Dan Quayle, who has had his own problems with the issue.
 
A Republican Version Of Ann Richards
 Every convention, it seems, needs a colorful woman from Texas to run it. In New York, at the Democratic National Convention, it was Ann W. Richards, the Governor of Texas, who was voted temporary chairwoman of the gathering and said some pithy and not very flattering things about George Bush and Dan Quayle.
In Houston, Kay Bailey Hutchison, the Texas Treasurer, is also the temporary chairman. Her mission, it seemed, was the same as Ms. Richards's, only in reverse.
Suggesting that Mr. Clinton had unrealistic views of the economy and just about everything else, she proclaimed: "You know something? I think he really did inhale."
At times, Ms. Hutchison seemed to be almost consciously imitating Ms. Richards, who tormented Mr. Bush in 1988 by quipping that he was born "with a silver foot in his mouth." She used the same oratorical cadence, held her head high and stiff, just like the silver-haired Ms. Richards, and tried to turn her Democratic colleague's own words on her.
"Poor Ann, she can't help it -- she was born with silver roots in her hair," said Ms. Hutchison, who has tinted blond hair.
 
Buchanan Supporters Keep an Eye on 1996
 Mr. Buchanan declared in his speech tonight that the "the primaries are over" and that he was behind Mr. Bush "all the way to a great comeback victory in November."
His loyalists on the convention floor, who call themselves "The Buchanan Brigade," made it clear that Nov. 3, Election Day, is where the unity ends.
Tonight they proclaimed Mr. Buchanan the early leader in the fight for the next Republican Presidential nomination that turns in large part on the party's right wing.
Vice President Dan Quayle, they insisted, is no competition. Mr. Buchanan is "more of a leader than Dan Quayle," said Lester Firstenberger, 29, a lawyer from Nashville.
His fellow delegate, Bill Dearing, said two other conservatives, William J. Bennett, the former Education Secretary, and Jack F. Kemp Jr., the Housing Secretary, had "sold out."

HEADLINE: IN THEIR OWN WORDS;
Excerpts Of Address By Reagan To G.O.P.

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from remarks by former President Ronald Reagan to the Republican National Convention last night as recorded and transcribed by The New York Times.
To hear them talk, you'd never know that the nightmare of nuclear annihilation has been lifted from our sleep. You'd never know that our standard of living remains the highest in the world. You'd never know that our air is cleaner than it was 20 years ago. You'd never know that we remain the one nation the rest of the world looks to for leadership. 
 It wasn't always this way. We mustn't forget -- even if they would like to -- the very different America that existed just 12 years ago; an America with 21 percent interest rates and back-to-back years of double-digit inflation; an America where mortgage payments doubled, paychecks plunged, and motorists sat in gas lines; an America whose leaders told us it was our own fault; that ours was a future of scarcity and sacrifice; and that what we really needed was another good dose of government control and higher taxes.
It wasn't so long ago that the world was a far more dangerous place as well. It was a world where aggressive Soviet communism was on the rise and American strength was in decline. It was a world where our children came of age under the threat of nuclear holocaust. It was a world where our leaders told us that standing up to aggressors was dangerous, that American might and determination were somehow obstacles to peace.
But we stood tall and proclaimed that communism was destined for the ash heap of history. We never heard so much ridicule from our liberal friends. The only thing that got them more upset was two simple words: "Evil Empire."
But we knew then what the liberal Democrat leaders just couldn't figure out: the sky would not fall if America restored her strength and resolve. The sky would not fall if an American President spoke the truth. The only thing that would fall was the Berlin Wall.
WINNING THE COLD WAR -- I heard those speakers at that other convention saying "we won the cold war" -- and I couldn't help wondering, just who exactly do they mean by "we"? And to top it off, to top it off, they even tried to portray themselves as sharing the same fundamental values of our party.
But they truly don't understand is principles so eloquently stated by Abraham Lincoln: "You cannot strengthen the weak by weakening the strong. You cannot help the wage-earner by pulling down the wage-payer. You cannot help the poor by destroying the rich. You cannot help men permanently by doing for them what they could and should do for themselves."
If we, if we ever, if we ever hear the Democrats quoting that passage by Lincoln and acting like they mean it, then, my friends, we will know that the opposition has really changed.
Until then, when we see all that rhetorical smoke billowing out from the Democrats, well, ladies and gentlemen, I'd follow the example of their nominee: don't inhale.
All right, all right. Just listen to me. This fellow they have nominated claims he's the new Thomas Jefferson. Well, let me tell you something -- I knew Thomas Jefferson. He was a friend of mine, and Governor, you're no Thomas Jefferson.

 	 	 		. ..	 	BEST DAYS AHEAD -- America remains what Emerson called her 150 years ago, "the country of tomorrow." What a wonderful description and how true. And yet tomorrow might never have happened had we lacked the courage in the 1980's to chart a course of strength and honor.
All the more reason no one should underestimate the importance of this campaign and what the outcome will mean. The stakes are high. The Presidency is serious business. We cannot afford to take a chance.
We need a man of serious purpose, unmatched experience, knowledge and ability. A man who understands government, who understands our country and who understands the world. A man who has been at a table with Gorbachev and Yeltsin. A man whose performance as commander-in-chief of the bravest and most effective fighting force in history left the world in awe and the people of Kuwait free of foreign tyranny. Yes, yes, yes. Four more years. A man who has devoted more than half of his life to serving his country. A man of decency, integrity and honor.
And tonight I come to tell you that I -- warmly, genuinely, wholeheartedly support the re-election of George Bush as president of the United States.
All right. O.K. All right. We know President Bush. By his own admission, he is a quiet man, not a showman. He is a trustworthy and levelheaded leader who is respected around the world. His is a steady hand on the tiller through the choppy waters of the 90's, which is exactly what we need.
We need George Bush!

HEADLINE: Biosys's Pest Killers Go Underground

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PALO ALTO, Calif.

 BODY:
Like the products it nurtures, wormlike nematodes that survive by invading insects that live in the soil, Biosys Inc. plans to flourish in a niche.
Biosys is content to let other biotechnology companies pursue the more than $4 billion spent worldwide each year on synthetic chemicals and biological agents to fight insects above the ground, where nematodes quickly perish. A big slice of the $1.8 billion spent to control soil-dwelling pests would do fine, thank you, at least as a start. 
 "The opportunities are explosive," said Paul D. Dick, national sales manager for the nine-year-old company, which is based in an industrial park here at the northern edge of Silicon Valley.
Like other agricultural biotech companies, Biosys has some trends in its favor. As some of the most effective and long-lasting synthetic chemicals have been outlawed for environmental reasons during the last 20 years, farmers have become eager to use biological pesticides along with the chemicals that remain.
Biosys has something else: a patented production technique that is cutting the cost of these hard-to-cultivate creatures enough to make them competitive for the first time in treating several agricultural crops. It has developed a process to grow nematodes with bacteria in a liquid broth of nutrients resembling those found in insect prey. That is expected to transform a cottage industry, which has served ecologically conscious gardeners and small organic farmers, into a big business.
"The fermentation technology is like the difference between hand-weaving fabric and making it in a modern textile mill," said Venkat S. Sohoni, Biosys's president and chief executive. "We used to raise 2 billion nematodes a week. Now we make 3.5 trillion."
Production at such levels, which the company began to achieve early this year, is necessary, since it can take concentrations of several billion nematodes an acre to control many soil-dwelling pests.
 
Costs Remain High
 At the moment, nematodes are still expensive, but they are proving useful in some circumstances. Cranberry growers in Washington state, for example, have been using nematodes in increasing numbers for four years at a cost of $300 an acre. Most use them only at times in the growing season when no chemicals are allowed or when black vine weevils threaten to overwhelm the chemicals, according to Bob Hitt, chairman of the Washington Cranberry Growers Alliance.
Mint growers have found nematodes more economical than chemicals, because they require fewer applications, Biosys says.
Biosys's nematodes have no impact on humans, plants, or beneficial soil-dwellers like earthworms, but they come armed with a type of bacterium that makes them deadly predators for a variety of insect pests like weevils, grubs and the larvae of a number of insects that live most of their lives above ground. The nematode penetrates the insect, releases the bacteria that kills its host, and starts breeding. After several generations inside the corpse, the food supply is exhausted and more than 100,000 hungry juvenile nematodes burst out looking for new hosts.
Biosys's next challenge, which has to be met crop by crop, region by region, is to prove that nematodes are as effective as the chemicals that remain. "The safety advantage is a good reason to charge a premium, but it's not good enough to introduce the product," said Ramon Georgis, Biosys's director of field development.
Analysts expect sales of nematodes to push Biosys into the black by the end of next year. The company lost $2 million on revenues of $1.9 million in the first six months of this year. By 1996, earnings ought to exceed $9 million and sales should be nearing $50 million, according to Allen H. Cohen, an analyst at Kemper Securities Group Inc., the Chicago brokerage firm that co-managed the first public offering of Biosys shares in March.
 Biosys's lineup of revenue-producing products already includes the Biosafe insecticides for the consumer lawn care and garden market, sold by the Ortho division of Chevron; a professional lawn and plant care line marketed by Ciba-Geigy of Switzerland, and products for citrus, cranberry, artichoke and mint growers sold directly by Biosys.
 
Production Arrangement
 Biosys's commercial and technical success allowed the company to leverage its patented fermentation process into an exclusive manufacturing agreement with the Archer Daniels Midland Company, the nation's largest fermenter of biological products. Under the new arrangement, Biosys becomes, in effect, the gatekeeper for any other biotech firms that would also like to use Archer Daniels's state-of-the-art operations.
"It's a unique relationship," said R. Patrick Simms, Biosys's vice president of manufacturing. "We can enter contracts to scale up manufacturing for other firms, and it gives us something to trade for marketing resources or a share of new products. It allows A.D.M. to get more business without really getting involved in projects too small to really interest them, and without having people from lots of companies at their facility."
Archer Daniels executives say they have been impressed by Biosys's technical skills and by the work of Biosys employees transplanted to the Decatur, Ill., fermenting complex when production began this year.
"The successful installation and start-up of bulk nematode production exceeded our expectations," Mark Whitacre, president of Archer Daniels's Bioproducts Division, said early this month as part of an announcement expanding the partnership.
Some of the industry's most experienced analysts, like George Dahlman of Piper Jaffray & Hopwood in Minneapolis, say they have a hard time imagining the new arrangement adding much to Biosys's prospects or Archer Daniels's business. "There's lots of fermenting capacity out there, so other start-ups would not be willing to give Biosys much to get into A.D.M.," Mr. Dahlman said.
But nematodes alone should keep Biosys busy. There are many families of the creatures. Although some are pests that cause diseases in humans, animals or plants, the Environmental Protection Agency has decided there is no need to regulate the families that Biosys has concentrated on, Steinernema and Heterorhabditid.
 
Rivals' Approach
 So far, all of Biosys's products are based on strains of Steinernema. Some potential rivals, like Ecogen Inc., which recently acquired Bioenterprises, an Australian nematode producer, say they are focusing on Heterorhabditids. "We have heard that they are more active hunters, at least against things like grubs that don't move a lot," said John McIntyre, vice president of commercial development at Ecogen, which is based in Langhorne, Pa.
Ecogen hopes to have its own fermentation process running in three years. One concern: it looks as if Heterorhabditids do not stand up well to such mass production.
To survive, nematodes need both moisture and protection from the ultraviolet rays in sunlight. They are also sensitive to temperature extremes. Farmers have to be more careful about when they apply nematodes than chemicals if they want to get the maximum benefit.
In the long run, scientists are likely to attempt to use genetic engineering to make beneficial nematodes tougher and more versatile. But genetically altered nematodes would also draw close scrutiny from regulators, so the shorter-term strategic emphasis is on testing natural strains found in soil samples. Biosys has built up a "library" of 300 strains, most of them preserved in frozen form.
 
Packaging Systems
 Biosys has also invested heavily in developing a patented process for packing nematodes in gels, along with several other packaging systems for different markets. One approach is to store them in tea-bag-like packaging on flexible plastic frames, which extends their shelf life to five months in normal temperatures. "None of the packing materials we're using were available 10 years ago," said Bruce Dunlop, manager of formulations development.
The nematodes are usually applied with standard agricultural spraying equipment after being mixed with water or, sometimes, chemicals.
Despite the nematodes' preferences for underground life, Biosys sees other opportunities. Some strains may be effective above the ground in shady places or in the controlled environment of the greenhouse. Nematode hotels in the kitchen are also a distinct possibility.
The smelliest room in the company's research department is currently the site of cockroach carnage, as test populations of roaches are exposed to different concentrations and strains of nematodes. Spared from the experiments, however, are the closest thing to the company has to mascots: Twinkie-sized roaches from Madagascar and Costa Rica that the researchers keep as pets.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
A Market Made In Hedger Heaven

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
RICHARD SANDOR remembers why many said interest rate futures contracts were a foolish idea. "The criticism was that interest rates don't fluctuate enough, and so who needs to hedge?"
Mr. Sandor, as much as anyone, can be deemed to be the father of interest rate futures, which have been trading for 15 years and now dominate the futures markets as perhaps the most successful financial product ever introduced. The actual birthday will be Saturday, but the Chicago Board of Trade will stage its celebration on Friday, mindful that traders value their weekends. 
 On an average day, traders now exchange futures that control $285 billion in underlying government bonds. They do so with only minimal requirements for margins and have become such an accepted part of the markets that it is hard to find a bond trader who remembers what life was like without futures.
Birthdays of products, like those of people, are usually worth noting only to those directly involved. But interest rate futures have made a huge difference in the way financial markets function and perhaps in the way that the Government operates. It is probable that the huge expansion of Federal debt could not have been managed, at least not without more strain to the system, without the ability to lay off the risk of interest rate changes. It is that ability that is the hallmark of the futures markets.
The industry believes that the existence of bond futures has minimized volatility in interest rates, and that is probably true on most days. But they have also made it much easier to quickly place huge bets on the direction of interest rates, in ways that can destabilize markets in times of stress. When a flood closed the Board of Trade earlier this year, there was little activity in the bond market.
The growth of the futures markets as financial centers -- last year the Chicago Board of Trade traded twice as many futures contracts as it traded all agriculture futures -- created a rival center for power to New York, which had dominated bond trading. Many in New York regret the missed opportunity, but Mr. Sandor, now an executive managing director at Kidder, Peabody & Company, thinks it was inevitable. It takes an outsider, he argues, "to cause structural change in any industry," simply because the insiders see no need to risk big changes.
The fact that futures markets now vie for dominance in the trading of bonds, as well as in stocks through similar stock index futures, has created a system of competitive regulation that the financial industry has sometimes been able to use to its benefit in resisting regulation it considers to be heavy-handed. The cash market in bonds is partly regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and partly by the Treasury. But the futures are regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a group that was originally founded to keep watch on agricultural futures.
The C.F.T.C., in turn, is watched over by the House and Senate Agriculture Committees, which are dominated by farm-state representatives who seek such committee seats largely to protect one farm program or another. And it is those legislators who are now trying to sort out a bitter battle in which the futures markets are trying to put limits on the trading of interest-rate swaps, which provide a competitive way to hedge against the risks of changing interest rates.
In theory, an interest rate future is simple. A contract requires the seller to deliver, on a particular date, $100,000 in 8 percent, 30-year Treasury bonds, or an equivalent value of a similar bond issue. In fact, few bonds are ever delivered as a result of the contracts. Instead, those who buy contracts sell them before they expire.
The beauty of such futures contracts is that for a small margin -- $2,025 now controls $100,000 in bonds -- a trader can offset the risk to a portfolio of a sharp rise, or fall, in interest rates. Without such a hedging technique's being available, it would be extremely dangerous for Wall Street firms to buy huge quantities of government bonds at auctions, or to underwrite large corporate bond issues. A big rise in rates could wipe out such a firm, as the value of the bonds being held came tumbling down.
While Mr. Sandor, an academic turned Wall Street official, gets the credit for proposing interest rate futures, it is Paul A. Volcker who should probably be praised for convincing traders that they were absolutely necessary, simply by showing that bond prices could be unbelievably volatile. The "Saturday night massacre" of Oct. 6, 1979, sent bond prices tumbling as Mr. Volcker, then chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, signaled he meant to get inflation under control, whatever the cost.
That move came just after underwriters led by Salomon Brothers had bought $1 billion in bonds from I.B.M. and caused the value of the bonds to plunge by more than $60 million. But Salomon had used Treasury futures to hedge, a fact that impressed Wall Street. Of course, other traders, many of them speculators, had suffered the losses, just as they would have profited had interest rates fallen.
That helped to set off the huge rise in volume. It nearly quadrupled in 1979, then tripled in 1980, to almost $26 billion a day. And that was less than a tenth of the peak reached in 1990. Now there are numerous other interest rate futures, as well as growing markets in options on such futures.
The fact that volume seems to have peaked in 1990 and is running about 5 percent lower now, does not bother Mr. Sandor. "This is a market that is driven by hedgers," he said, and with interest rates having fallen steadily in recent months, there are fewer who think they need to spend the money to hedge. "When you get an upturn in the economy and a perception that interest rates have bottomed, you'll see a lot more hedging."

HEADLINE: An Affirmative-Action Plan For Birmingham Is Upheld

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 17

 BODY:
After more than a decade of litigation, a Federal district judge has upheld an affirmative action plan for the City of Birmingham, Ala., including numerical hiring goals that were attacked by the Reagan Administration and by white city employees.
The Birmingham case, one of the nation's most celebrated courtroom tests of affirmative action, involves firefighters, police officers and other city employees. It has attracted attention around the country and has already been reviewed once by the United States Supreme Court. The High Court ruling in 1989, which allowed the reopening of job bias cases in a number of cities, was considered a major setback by civil rights advocates. 
 Judge Sam C. Pointer Jr., chief judge of the Federal District Court in Birmingham, said the city's affirmative action plan was legally justified in view of the exclusion of blacks from city jobs in the past. In a ruling on Friday, he concluded that the plan "did not unnecessarily trammel the rights of whites" and did not violate their constitutional rights.
 
Appeal Is Planned
 Raymond P. Fitzpatrick Jr., a lawyer for white city employees who are plaintiffs in the case, said today that they would appeal Judge Pointer's decision.
Richard T. Seymour, a lawyer for black employees of the Birmingham fire and police departments, said the latest decision "will give encouragement to many employers, public and private, to continue their affirmative action plans."
Mayor Richard Arrington Jr. of Birmingham welcomed the decision. "I hope that it will help hasten the end of this fight over reverse discrimination in the City of Birmingham," the Mayor said in an interview.
The Bush Administration says it supports affirmative action in principle. But it has often opposed enforcement of numerical goals for the hiring and promotion of blacks, Hispanic people and women, arguing that such goals tend to become rigid quotas.
Administration officials had no immediate comment on the ruling in Birmingham. "We are not commenting at this time," said Amy J. Casner, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department.
 
Origin of Case
 The Birmingham case began in 1975, when the Justice Department sued the city, charging that there was a pervasive "pattern and practice" of illegal job discrimination against blacks and women. After a long trial, the Justice Department helped negotiate a consent decree, which set up an extensive plan of affirmative action, including numerical goals for the hiring and promotion of women.
Under the original decree, for example, one black firefighter was to be promoted for each white who won promotion to lieutenant in the Birmingham Fire Department. The decree stipulated that all the people selected for such promotions must be qualified for their new jobs.
The Justice Department signed the decree in May 1981, but it later challenged actions taken by the city under the decree. Then in 1984, the department sided with white city employees who said their rights had been violated by the preferences given to blacks.
Mr. Arrington, a black who has been Mayor since 1979, strongly supports the affirmative action plan. "This city was once steeped in discrimination," he said today. "If affirmative action can't prevail here, it can't prevail anywhere in America. The strongest case you can make for affirmative action based on past racial discrimination is the one you can make in Birmingham, because of its history."
 
Justices Order Trial
 Judge Pointer's decision upholding the Birmingham plan reflects his assessment of evidence presented to him at a trial in October 1991. The trial was required by a Supreme Court decision in June 1989. The High Court said that white city employees had not had an adequate opportunity to present their objections to the consent decree at a trial held by Judge Pointer in 1985.
Robert D. Joffe, a lawyer at Cravath, Swaine & Moore in New York who represented black city employees in Birmingham, hailed Judge Pointer's decision as "a great victory for affirmative action."
"This case demonstrates that affirmative action can be constitutional and justified when the remedy is narrowly tailored" to correct the effects of discrimination, Mr. Joffe said.
In his latest ruling, Judge Pointer said the adoption of numerical goals for promoting blacks in Birmingham was justified by statistical evidence showing "underrepresentation of blacks in traditionally segregated job categories."
Judge Pointer approved the consent decree in 1981, and in his new ruling he rejected the arguments of white city employees who challenged the decree as too broad a remedy. "The decree is limited and tailored to the relief necessary to overcome the employment effects of past discrimination by the city," said the judge, who was appointed by President Richard M. Nixon in 1970.
 
Effect of Ruling
 Mr. Joffe said that "affirmative action was coming to be accepted as an appropriate remedy" in Birmingham when the Justice Department and some white city employees attacked the consent decree in the early 1980's. "They kept this matter festering for 11 years," he said. The effect of Judge Pointer's new decision is to uphold actions taken under the 1981 decree.
Mr. Fitzpatrick, the lawyer for white city employees, said today: "We are disappointed that Judge Pointer did not rule in our favor, but we are not surprised because he has never ruled for us before. The quotas in the consent decree and, more important, the manner in which they were implemented violate the constitutional rights of the white firefighters to equal protection of the laws."

HEADLINE: THE REPUBLICAN PLATFORM
ISSUES: ABORTION;
G.O.P. Avoids an Open Debate on Abortion

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Aug. 17

 BODY:
The Bush campaign managed to avoid an open debate on the abortion issue at the Republican convention today by appealing to the loyalty of leaders of pivotal state delegations who themselves favor abortion rights.
Polls of delegates show that only a few favor the rigid position on abortion taken in the party's platform, and the Bush camp took pains to place some distance between the President and the platform. 
 Torie Clarke, the campaign spokeswoman, said her colleagues had worked to prevent an abortion debate on the convention floor because "we wanted to get the convention off on the right foot." And she stressed what has become a theme of the Bush camp -- that "people can be pro-choice and pro-Bush."
As a consequence of appeals from the Bush campaign, Gov. Pete Wilson of California and former Gov. Thomas H. Kean of New Jersey, among others, persuaded the delegates from their states who are unhappy with the platform that a televised debate over abortion would hurt President Bush and help his Democratic opponent, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas.
 
'Immense' White House Pressure
 "It was just a standard kind of whip action," said Charles Black, a senior political adviser who represented the President's interests in the platform debate.
The abortion rights forces tried to keep delegates in line, but were outgunned by the strength of the Bush organization. "The pressure from the White House has been immense," said Nancy Sternoff, executive director of the National Republican Coalition for Choice.
Kate Michelman, president of the National Abortion Rights Action League, said few delegates were willing "to buck the hierarchy of the party."
The abortion plank advocates a constitutional amendment that would outlaw abortion in virtually all circumstances. It would not allow abortions when pregnancies were caused by rape or incest, exceptions favored by Mr. Bush.
The entire platform was adopted without amendment by voice vote this afternoon. Under the party's rules, a floor discussion of a platform plank could have taken place only if a majority of the members of the delegations of six states signed statements saying they opposed the plank.
The leaders of the movement opposed to the abortion section, Govs. William F. Weld of Massachusetts and John R. McKernan Jr. of Maine, said today that they gave up their fight after only four delegations sided with them. Those were the ones from Maine, Massachusetts, New Mexico and the Virgin Islands.
The abortion rights forces fell six signatures short in New Jersey and two in Vermont. No vote was taken in California after Governor Wilson's appeal, although a majority of the delegates were said to favor a right to abortion at least in some circumstances.
A CBS News poll of delegates found that only 7 percent favored a law that would, as the platform states, permit abortions "under no circumstances." But the only support for abortion rights in convention speeches today came from Senator John Seymour of California, who, according to statewide polls, is running behind his Democratic opponent, former Mayor Dianne Feinstein of San Francisco, in a race in which abortion is an important issue.
Senator Seymour began his five-minute speech this way: "I'm pro-choice, I'm pro-family and I'm pro-jobs. To say I'm entirely happy with our party platform would be untrue. I, for one, believe it should be changed. However, there is much, much more in our party platform that unites us than divides us."
That was his only mention of the issue.
But down on the floor, some delegates said they were disappointed by the direction the party was taking. "We should be moving to the center, not to the right," said Maureen Ogden, a State Representative from New Jersey. "You don't win elections when you move to one extreme or the other."
The New Jersey delegation would probably have voted against the abortion plank had not former Governor Kean given a strong speech against such a stand at a delegation meeting Sunday night. Delegates quoted Mr. Kean as saying that he would "vote his conscience" if he thought the platform could be changed, but that such a battle was fruitless and would only hurt Mr. Bush's re-election chances.
Governor Wilson made the same point to the delegates from California in a speech from Sacramento transmitted here by satellite. "By promoting a fight that cannot be won," he said, "you risk creating rancor and division."
Phil Moore, a California delegate, said the Governor's speech "made us realize the importance of the issue."
Republicans were not alone in trying to keep disagreement on the abortion issue under wraps. At their convention in New York last month, the Democrats did not allow any speakers who objected to their party's line against any legal restrictions on abortions.
And there was no evidence here that disagreement over abortion would cause delegates to abandon their party. Reciting the lesson of the day, Governor Weld declared, "You can very rationally and easily conclude, as I do, that you can be pro-choice and pro-Bush because of the importance of re-electing the President on the grounds of economic, tax and spending issues and foreign policy."

HEADLINE: THE REPUBLICAN PLATFORM;
Excerpts From the Republican Party's Platform: A New Call for Unity

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the platform adopted by the Republican National Convention.
 
PREAMBLE
 Abraham Lincoln, our first Republican President, expressed the philosophy that inspires Republicans to this day: "The legitimate object of Government is to do for a community of people whatever they need to have done, but cannot do at all, or cannot so well do, for themselves in their separate and individual capacities. But in all that people can individually do as well for themselves, Government ought not to interfere."

 	 	 		. . .	 	America had its rendezvous with destiny in 1980. Faced with crisis at home and abroad, Americans turned to Republican leadership in the White House. Presidents Reagan and Bush turned our Nation away from the path of over-taxation, hyper-regulation, and mega-government. Instead, we moved in a new direction. We cut taxes, reduced red tape, put people above bureaucracy. And so we vanquished the idea of the almighty state as the supervisor of our daily lives. In choosing hope over fear, Americans raised a beacon, reminding the world that we are a shining city on a hill, the last best hope for man on earth.

 	 	 		. . .	 	We believe in a President who represents the national interest, not just the aggregation of well-connected special interests; a President who brings unity to the American purpose. . . .
 
UNITING OUR FAMILY
 
 . . . Our greatness starts at home -- literally. So Republicans believe government should strengthen families, not replace them. Today, more than ever, the traditional family is under assault. We believe our laws should reflect what makes our Nation prosperous and wholesome: faith in God, hard work, service to others, and limited government.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
Family: The Home of Freedom
 THE RIGHTS OF THE FAMILY -- . . . Republicans trust parents and believe they, not courts and lawyers, know what is best for their children. That is why we will work to insure that the Congress and the States shall enact no law abridging the rights of the family formed by blood, marriage, adoption, or legal custody -- rights which are anterior and superior to those of government. Republicans oppose and resist the efforts of the Democrat Party to redefine the traditional American family.

 	 	 		. . .	 	CARING FOR CHILDREN -- George Bush secured the American family's most important victory of the last four years: his child care bill. . . .
The demands of employment and commuting often make it hard for parents to spend time with their children. Republicans advocate maximum flexibility in working and child care arrangements so that families can make the most of their schedules. We support pro-family policies: job sharing, telecommuting, compressed work weeks, parental leave negotiated between employer and employees, and flextime.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
Achieving Educational Excellence
 The Republican strategy is based on sound principle. Parents have the right to choose the best school for their children. Schools should teach right from wrong. Schools should reinforce parental authority, not replace it. We should increase flexibility from Federal regulation. We should explore a new generation of break-the-mold New American Schools. Standards and assessments should be raised, not reduced to a lowest common denominator. Communities should be empowered to find what works. The pursuit of excellence in education is a fundamental goal. Good teachers should be rewarded for teaching well. Alterative certification can bring desperately needed new people into the teaching profession.

 	 	 		. . .	 	America must remain neutral toward particular religions, but we must not remain neutral toward religion itself or the values religion supports. Mindful of our country's Judeo-Christian heritage and rich religious pluralism, we support the right of students to engage in voluntary prayer in schools and the right of the community to do so at commencements or other occasions. We will strongly enforce the law guaranteeing equal access to school facilities. We also advocate recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance in schools as a reminder of the principles that sustain us as one Nation under God. . . .
 
For Healthier Families
 PROMOTE HEALTH, PREVENT DISEASE, REFORM HEALTH CARE -- . . . Republicans believe government control of health care is irresponsible and ineffective. We believe health care choices should remain in the hands of the people, not government bureaucrats. This issue truly represents a fundamental difference between the two parties.

 	 	 		. . .	 	AIDS -- The H.I.V./AIDS epidemic has exploded over the past decade into a crisis of tragic proportions. In our country, AIDS has already claimed more than 150,000 lives, and as many as one million more Americans may have been infected with the virus.
Epidemics have, throughout history, challenged governments, which have too often been powerless to combat them. Science -- and human wisdom -- have advanced, however, and we have met this crisis not only with a massive commitment of resources but also with a personal determination on the part of the President. That commitment and leadership will continue.

 	 	 		. . .	 	PROMOTING CULTURAL VALUES -- . . . Elements within the media, the entertainment industry, academia, and the Democrat Party are waging a guerrilla war against American values. They deny personal responsibility, disparage traditional morality, denigrate religion, and promote hostility toward the family's way of life. Children, the members of our society most vulnerable to cultural influences, are barraged with violence and promiscuity, encouraging reckless and irresponsible behavior. This undermines the authority of parents, the ones most responsible for passing on to their offspring a sense of right and wrong. The lesson our Party draws is important -- that all of us, individuals and corporations alike, have a responsibility to reflect the values we expect our fellow citizens to exhibit.

 	 	 		. . .	 	We oppose any legislation or law which legally recognizes same-sex marriages and allows such couples to adopt children or provide foster care. . . .
Government has a responsibility, as well, to insure that it promotes the common moral values that bind us together as a Nation. We therefore condemn the use of public funds to subsidize obscenity and blasphemy masquerading as art. The fine arts, including those with public support, can certainly enrich our society. However, no artist has an inherent right to claim taxpayer support for his or her private vision of art if that vision mocks the moral and spiritual basis on which our society is founded. We believe a free market in art -- with neither suppression nor favoritism by government -- is the best way to foster the cultural revival our country needs.
 
Individual Rights, Good Homes and Safe Streets


 	 	 		. . .	 	REBUILDING THE DREAM -- . . . In the tradition of Lincoln, President Bush has replicated the American dream of home-ownership. For first-time home buyers, he has proposed a $5,000 tax credit. For lower-income families, he has worked to restore opportunity through HOPE, his initiative to help tenants now dependent on federal aid to buy their own homes; Mortgage Revenue Bonds, to assist more than 1.9 million families to buy a first home; Low Income Housing Tax Credits, already producing more than 420,000 decent apartments at affordable prices; and HOME, a partnership among all levels of government to help low-income families secure better housing. . . .
ENDING DEPENDENCY -- . . . Today's welfare system is anti-work and anti-marriage. It taxes families to subsidize illegitimacy. It rewards unethical behavior and penalizes initiative. It cannot be merely tinkered with by Congress; it must be recreated by states and localities. Republican Governors and legislators in several states have already launched dramatic reforms, especially with workfare and learnfare. Welfare can no longer be a check in the mail with no responsibility.

 	 	 		. . .	 	SAFE HOMES AND STREETS -- . . . The Republican Party is committed to a drug-free America. During the last twelve years, we have radically reversed the Democrats' attitude of tolerance toward narcotics, vastly increased Federal operations against drugs, cleaned up the military, and launched mandatory testing for employees in various fields, including White House personnel. As a result, overall drug abuse is falling. We urge that states and communities emphasize anti-drug education by police officers and others in schools to educate young children to the dangers of the drug culture. Dope is no longer trendy.

 	 	 		. . .	 	NEW MEMBERS OF THE AMERICAN FAMILY -- Our Nation of immigrants continues to welcome those seeking a better life. This reflects our past, when some newcomers fled intolerance; some sought prosperity; some came as slaves. All suffered and sacrificed but hoped their children would have a better life. All searched for a shared vision -- and found one in America. Today we are stronger for our diversity.
Illegal entry into the United States, on the other hand, threatens the social compact on which immigration is based. That IS, the Nation accepts immigrants and is enriched by their determination and values. Illegal immigration, on the other hand, undermines the integrity of border communities and already crowded urban neighborhoods. We will build on the already announced strengthening of the Border Patrol to better coordinate interdiction of illegal entrants through greater cross-border cooperation. . . .
INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS -- The protection of individual rights is the foundation for opportunity and security.
The Republican Party is unique in this regard. Since its inception, it has respected every person, even when that proposition was not universally popular. Today, as in the day of Lincoln, we insist that no American's rights are negotiable.

 	 	 		. . .	 	We believe the unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed. We therefore reaffirm our support for a human life amendment to the Constitution, and we endorse legislation to make clear that the Fourteenth Amendment's protections apply to unborn children.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
UNITING OUR COUNTRY
 KEEPING WHAT YOU EARN -- The test of economic policy is whether it promotes economic growth and expands job opportunities. Lower taxes and an expanding economy depend on long term, consistent restraint in the growth of federal spending. . . .
The simple truth for the American people is this: The only safeguard between themselves and Democrat tax increases is the use of the veto by George Bush and enough Republican votes in Congress to sustain it.

 	 	 		. . .	 	We will cut the capital gains tax rate to 15 percent -- zero in enterprise zones -- and index it so government cannot profit from inflation by taxing phantom capital gains, literally stealing from savings and pensions.

 	 	 		. . .	 	LIBERATION THROUGH DEREGULATION -- . . . We support President Bush's freeze on new regulations. We applaud his Competitiveness Council, under Vice President Quayle, for fighting the regulatory mania, saving the public $20 billion with its initial 90-day moratorium on new regulations and billions more under the current 120-day freeze.

 	 	 		. . .	 	JOB CREATION AND SMALL BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES -- . . . To create jobs and keep small business growing, the Republican Party supports increased access to capital for business expansion, exporting, long term investment, opportunity capital for the disadvantaged, and capital to bring new products and new technology to the market.
The Republican Party enthusiastically encourages the passage of Federal enterprise zones. Enterprise zones have been effective programs for promoting growth in urban and rural America. Republicans believe that the concept of enterprise zones is based on unyielding faith in the entrepreneurial spirit of all Americans. . . .

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
Reforming Government and the Legal System
 CLEANING UP THE IMPERIAL CONGRESS. -- The Democrats have controlled the House of Representatives for 38 years -- five years longer than Castro has held Cuba. They have held the Senate for 32 of those 38. Their entrenched power has produced a Congress arrogant, out of touch . . . . Republicans want to change all that. We reaffirm our support for a constitutional amendment to limit the number of terms House Members and Senators may serve.

 	 	 		. . .	 	MANAGING GOVERNMENT IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST -- . . . We deplore the blatant political bias of the government-sponsored radio and television networks. It is especially outrageous that taxpayers are now forced to underwrite this biased broadcasting through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB). We call for sweeping reform of CPB .

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
Our Land, Food, and Resources
 AGRICULTURE -- The Republican Party is the home of the farmer, rancher, and forester. We have long championed their right to pursue growth, efficiency, and competitiveness through market incentives, diversification, and personal ingenuity. 

 	 	 		. . .	 	We value our Nation's real wetlands habitat and the diversity of our native animal and plant life. We oppose, however, bureaucratic harassment of farm, ranch, and timber families under statutes regarding endangered species and wetlands.

 	 	 		. . .	 	PUBLIC LANDS -- . . . We believe that recreation, forestry, ranching, mining, oil and gas exploration, and production on our public lands can be conducted in a way compatible with their conservation. The United States has some of the richest mineral resources in the world. Our public lands should not be arbitrarily locked up and put off limits to responsible uses.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
UNITING OUR WORLD
 Building on the legacy of Ronald Reagan, George Bush saw the chance to sweep away decadent Communism. He was the first Western leader to declare his determination to fashion "a Europe whole and free." . . .
Yet now that we have won the Cold War, we must also win the peace. We must not repeat the mistake of the past by throwing away victory through complacency. A new world beckons, unlike any we have ever known, filled with uncertainties. Old passions have re-emerged. New democracies struggle to decide their destiny. Nations are torn asunder. Migrants and refugees strain the social fabric of continents. Tyrants work to build nuclear, chemical, and even biological weapons to threaten us and our neighbors. Drug trafficking and terrorism, often linked, menace Americans at home and abroad. . . .
PROVEN LEADERSHIP -- George Bush has been the most important architect of Western aspirations and designs for the challenging world we are now entering. . . .
The test of international leadership is on the field, not in a playbook. The Oval Office is no place for on-the job training -- not in carrying out the Presidential duty to protect and defend our Nation, not in managing the arsenal of the supreme nuclear power. There are those who talk and those who perform. George Bush has clearly performed for America, making the right calls in a series of tough decisions that helped transform the world.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bonds Fall as Convention Opens

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The bond market fell yesterday as investors waited to see what kind of economic program the Republicans would outline at their convention in Houston.
But the pause in the market, with the resulting rise in yields, has not discouraged big borrowers from continuing to lower their interest costs by recalling old debt at higher rates and issuing new notes or bonds at much lower rates. Even with the decline yesterday, the yield on the 30-year bond is still lower than it was in Janaury. 
 The Tennessee Valley Authority made such a move yesterday, issuing $700 million in new 30-year bonds that together with earlier refinancings has lowered the utility's annual borrowing costs by $200 million.
After comments by James A. Baker 3d, the incoming chief of staff, helped undermine the bond market on Thursday, traders said they were paying more attention to the impact of the election, especially during this convention week. There has been talk of President Bush proposing some kind of tax cut to help stimulate the economy, a proposal that has some investors worried because it could signal a rise in the record Federal budget deficit.
Analysts said that the decline in bond and note prices, which saw the 30-year bond down almost half a point, was also a continuation of the correction after a rally in the bond market that pushed up prices and reduced yields on the 30-year bond to five-and-a-half-year lows.
 
Eyes on Meeting of the Fed
 Eyes were also on the meeting this week of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee, which could cut short-term interest rates again soon. Some analysts do not expect the committee to act during the Republican convention. But there is a growing feeling that the Fed, given the steady diet or recent sluggish economic data, will act again by the fall.
It is, however, hard to gauge what the Fed will do. And it is almost equally hard to keep track of the feelings in the market about whether the Fed will ease again or not. Lately a new Fed easing, like the half of a percentage point reduction in the Federal funds rate and the discount rate on July 2,, has been greeted by conclusions that it would be the last cut the Fed would make. Then as new economic data came out showing the the economy was still barely growing, the mood among traders and investors would swing back toward the belief that the Fed would have to act again.
"We're likely to have one more easing, if just for political and psychological reasons," said Thomas Synnott, chief economist at the U.S. Trust Company of New York. "But I don't think it will help very much," he added, because he expects only a quarter of a percentage point cut in the target Federal funds rate, which is now at 3.25 percent.
In late trading in the secondary market, the 7.25 percent, 30-year bond was offered at 98 25/32, down 15/32 to yield 7.35 percent, compared with 7.31 percent on Friday.
The 6.375 percent 10-year note was off 7/32, to yield 6.52 percent, compared with 6.5 percent at the end of last week. But the 5.5 percent five-year note was unchanged to yield 5.49 percent.
In the weekly auction of three-month and six-month bills, the discount rate fell for the second consecutive week, a reflection of the growing expectation of another easing by the Fed. The average discount rate for the three-month bill of 3.10 percent was the lowest since Feb. 14, 1972. And the average yield of 3.18 percent for the six-month bill was the lowest since July 1, 1963.
In the municipal market prices were off sharply and yields rose. the average yield of The Bond Buyer Index of major municipal securities was up to 6.22 percent from 6.20 percent. One executive at a firm involved in the municipal market said that the prices were falling because a lot of Wall Street firms had bought much of the new municipal issues in recent weeks and were having trouble moving them on to retail or institutional investors. "These have to be priced more attractively," he said, especially because there is another $4 billion to $5 billion of new municipal issues expected this week.
 
Concern Over Situation in Iraq
 In the Treasury market, some traders said there was also concern yesterday that the United States would have to take some retaliatory action against Iraq, which could lead to a jump in oil prices. President Bush, in an interview on the Cable News Network, said, as he has many times recently, that he would not let President Saddam Hussein of Iraq renege on agreements involving the destruction of the country's major weapons of war.
"I think he's just trying to thumb his nose at the rest of the world and he's not going to get away with it," the President said.
But traders thought the convention and just the need for a market correction had more to do with the decline yesterday.
If one thinks about it, it seems a little odd that investors and dealers are just now focusing on the Republican National Convention in Houston and the effect any economic stimulus program might have on the economy and the bond market.
Analysts and investors have known for a long time that the convention was this week and that a sluggish economy would prompt an economic stimulus program by the Democrats, if the Democratic nominee, Bill Clinton, wins, and possibly by the Republicans.
Although this is the case, in the bond market, as in other markets, like foreign exchange, the focus of investors tends at times to be single minded. And until Mr. Baker spoke last week the focus was on slow economic growth, low inflation and the growing conviciton that both these eoconomic developments were so positive for the bond market that they would push the yield on the 30-year bond as low as 7 percent by the end of the year.
Now, after the rally paused last week, the attention of investors has been distracted enough to make them worry about the convention and what it might tell them.
But that does not mean the rally cannot resume again if the news is not bad. In fact, the bond rally of July paused during the Democratic Naitonal Convention because of the surge of Mr. Clinton in the polls. But it resumed the next week, even as Mr. Clinton's popularity seemed to grow.
Following are the results of the Treasury's auction of three-month and six-month bills yesterday:

HEADLINE: OUR TOWNS;
2-Party Democracy Comes Screaming to Nassau

BYLINE: By Diana Jean Schemo

DATELINE: MINEOLA, L.I.

 BODY:
TALL wood panels line the grand meeting room of the Nassau County Board of Supervisors, suggesting an air of seriousness. But it is only a suggestion, for democracy here carries its share of theater, if not circus.
Consider the morning George Glasel, an 83-year-old with cancer, hijacked a standing-room-only crowd from matters of sludge to the threshold of wonder. 
 Mr. Glasel took the microphone just as homeowners from Cedar Creek and Bay Park -- incensed that the county was considering another sludge treatment plant in their neighborhoods -- faced down the muscular men from the trades unions, so disgusted at the dearth of jobs that they appeared eager to build anything, no matter how noxious.
"The last time I spoke to you was two months ago, and I was bald," Mr. Glasel began, reminding the audience of his illness.
"But sometimes, from a terrible tragedy something wonderful happens. Look at me now." He lowered his head to show the supervisors gray shoots sprouting from his scalp. Then he looked up, eyes alight with awe.
"Isn't it wonderful that we live in an age when a doctor can prescribe something to make an 83-year-old man grow hair?" The rancorous room -- taken aback as much by Mr. Glasel's testimony as by its unexpectedness -- fell silent.
Thus unfolds two-party democracy in Nassau County, long ruled by a Republican Party machine of legendary patronage and power. The election of three Democratic supervisors last year to a board of six, along with a recession that drained 91,000 jobs from Long Island, have renewed scrutiny in one of America's richest counties.
To be sure, people have always had the right to speak up at public meetings here and did so, often noisily, over certain issues, such as day care. But one-party government usually meant staid meetings at which supervisors announced decisions worked out in private.
Now, as Nassau gropes toward something approximating open government, its Board of Supervisors meetings have become a stage for the anger, the innocence and the mayhem of people newly preoccupied with the workings of government.
And for a brief and delightful moment, order is taking a back seat.
Even by the colorful standards of the day, last week's Board of Supervisor's meeting was raucous. At issue was a strange resolution to seek bids for freeze drying sludge at waste-treatment plants on the South Shore. The supervisors promised residents the county would just collect the bids, as required under a Federal consent decree to stop ocean dumping, while it sought a poorer county upstate to take Nassau's refuse.
The issue may well have begged for high drama and hyperbole.
Alan Baron, the first speaker from Cedar Creek, set the tone when he described the county's plans as duplicitous, and compared them with Nazi death camps, where "people marched through gates on which was written 'Freedom Through Work' on their way to the gas chambers."
Even the walls seemed to groan at the comparison.
If the meeting began with a list of speakers, it was quickly ignored. Neighborhood leaders and union men took the microphone at random, each speaker drawing taunts from the other side. They wheedled, ranted, intoned and, in a bind, insulted public officials and one another.
"No wonder people want change," Joseph Tortora from the Electrical Workers Union, said. "How long before we take responsibililty for our own garbage?" Mr. Tortora said Long Island had become the laughingstock of America when a barge of its trash floated endlessly at sea, turned away wherever it tried to land.
One out of work construction worker, said he, too, was troubled by the unusually high rate of breast cancer on Long Island.
"Married, I have three daughters," he began. "Between my wife and my three daughters that's four breasts." The spectators giggled and looked at one another, as the burly worker counted on his fingers. "Eight breasts. That's why I'm out of work, I guess."
After suggestions that the only way Nassau County could avoid a sludge problem were if everyone would stop going to the bathroom, the man ended with an image that made many wonder if the meetings were not sinking to a dangerous low.
"Let's not ship our sludge upstate," he said. "It will only run downhill and kill us later."
The meetings traditionally begin at 10:30 A.M. and usually end discreetly at lunch time, but last week's went on until 5:30 P.M.and adjourned inconclusively.
By then, the Democratic Supervisor from Oyster Bay, Lewis J. Yevoli, was so revolted that he scolded the audience for its "backtalk and screaming across the aisles."
"I have attended a lot of meetings, and I have never seen anything like this." he said. "I have never seen anything like this in my entire life." But then again, Nassau County hasn't seen two-party democracy in a long time either.

With Just One Bank Holdout, Chrysler Loan Appears Near

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Aug. 17

 BODY:
With only one of 152 banks still declining to sign a $6.8 billion loan agreement, the Chrysler Corporation appeared to be very close today to wrapping up the arrangement, which is crucial to its revitalization.
An executive with the auto maker, who spoke on condition of anonymity, declined to identify the lone holdout bank. In recent weeks, Chrysler solicited the help of Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, to persuade German central bankers to use their influence on German banks that were holding out. 
 All of the banks belong to a consortium that has been lending to Chrysler for about four years. The interest rate and charges on the new agreement are significantly higher than in the old one, reflecting perceptions that the company poses a higher risk because of the recession and its fragile financial condition.
 
Deadline Is This Week
 Still, Chrysler officials have been confident that the agreement will be completed by the end of the week. Officially, the company declined to comment on the negotiations.
If the agreement, which stipulates unanimous participation among the lenders, is not complete by the end-of-the-week deadline, the auto maker and its lead banks, the Chemical Banking Corporation and the Swiss Bank Corporation, could be forced to start negotiations all over.
The $6.8 billion loan replaces a loan of equal size to the Chrysler Financial Corporation that comes due in March and April. The money is used to finance retail vehicle purchases and dealers' wholesale inventory. Negotiating such loans has been routine in the past, but the process has been clouded by Chrysler's thin financial resources and regulatory pressure on banks.
 
Big Pension Obligation
 Among the big question marks on Chrysler's books is a $4 billion unfunded liability for employees' pensions. The auto maker asserts that an array of new models and higher demand for vehicles will allow it to pay off the liability over 10 years and to finance multibillion-dollar new-product programs.
Low ratings on Chrysler's debt securities by ratings agencies have made it prohibitively expensive for the company to raise money in the public markets. Several American banks initially resisted participation in the loan because they had changed their lending strategy to one that avoids large nationwide lending syndicates. But the pressure to join the Chrysler syndicate has been heavy because the fate of the company could be at stake.
The First Fidelity Bancorporation, a large banking company in New Jersey, said it would not comment on reports that it was the bank holding up Chrysler's financing.

Dollar Dips in Slow Trading As Investors Await Signals

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell slightly against most currencies yesterday in slow trading as investors watched for signals from the Republican National Convention. Gold prices rose.
"It was just sort of a no-man's land in the dollar markets, where no one knows what's going to happen" at the convention," said Robert Ryan, corporate foreign exchange manager at the Bank of New York Company. 
 In New York the dollar closed at 125.70 Japanese yen, down from 126.00 yen late Friday. In Tokyo the dollar closed at 126.25 yen, up 0.22 yen from Friday's close. Later in London the dollar was quoted at 125.72 yen.
The dollar rose in early European trading in anticipation that the German central bank would push interest rates lower, Mr. Ryan said. But dollar traders started selling off when ticker reports said a member of the German Bundesbank had commented that rates would not fall soon.
Higher interest rates in the United States and lower foreign yields would give investors incentive to buy more dollars.
In Europe the dollar rose to 1.4760 marks, from 1.4683 late Friday. But in New York the dollar closed at 1.4640 German marks, down from 1.4650 late Friday.
Traders are watching the convention closely for any signals on the direction of the American economy, which could affect interest rates, and on global tensions.
President Bush said yesterday that the United States had the right to "use force if necessary" to compel President Saddam Hussein of Iraq to comply with international inspection weapons demands and said President Hussein "is not going to get away" with defying the world.
Prospects of military action in the Middle East would be likely to move the dollar higher. It is seen as a safe haven for investors in times of global uncertainty.

Rising Polish Labor Unrest Sends Copper Up Sharply

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Copper futures settled sharply higher yesterday on the New York Commodity Exchange on technical factors and concern about the deteriorating labor situation in Poland.
The continuing strike at Poland's state copper producer Komginat Gorniczo Hutniczy Miedzi has increased expectations that the company will declare that it cannot meet export commitments because of conditions beyond its control. 
 Copper prices opened weakly, falling 70 points on concern over continued weakness in the world economy. But prices moved higher in a surge of commodity fund and commission-house buying, with the September contract settling 4.10 cents higher at $1.1540 a pound, a three-week high.
Giving a boost to copper was news of increased labor unrest in Poland, with the strike at the state producer spreading to other industries, including transportation, said Bernard Savaiko, an analyst with Paine Webber Inc.
"K.G.H.M. has been on strike since July 20," he said. "The market was looking for an early end, but no solution is in sight."
 
Coffee Tumbles
 Coffee futures fell on New York's Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange on selling pressure from Central American and Brazilian producers.
September coffee fell 2.25 cents, to 48.25 cents a pound.
Melissa Trout, an analyst with Cargill Investor Services Inc., said there was little new to influence the market. She said the coffee crop was the largest in 30 years, depressing the market.
Grain and soybean futures were higher in quiet trading on the Chicago Board of Trade.
The surge in prices was influenced by the release Friday of the National Weather Service's 30-day forecast, said Jerry Gidel, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
The forecast calls for normal to below normal temperatures through mid-September and normal to above-normal rainfall.
The unsettled relationship between Iraq and the United Nations gave a boost to crude oil and related energy futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
September light sweet crude oil was 17 cents higher at $21.45 a barrel; September heating oil was 0.45 cent higher at 59.35 cents a gallon; September unleaded gasoline was 0.78 cent higher at 61.58 cents a gallon; September natural gas was 7 cents lower at $1.762 for 1,000 cubic feet.
Livestock and meat futures were lower on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, under pressure from weak cash prices and expectations for reduced demand.
August live cattle were 0.60 cent lower at 73.95 cents a pound; August feeder cattle were 0.35 cent lower at 84.92 cents a pound; August live hogs were 0.38 cent lower at 44.07 cents a pound, and August frozen pork bellies were 0.55 cent lower at 38.40 cents a pound.

Kmart's Net Up by 3.1%; Tiffany Falls

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
Reflecting weak confidence among bargain hunters and affluent shoppers alike, the Kmart Corporation, the nation's second-largest retailer, behind Wal-Mart Stores Inc., reported a limp 3.1 percent increase in second-quarter earnings yesterday, and Tiffany & Company reported a 45.8 percent plunge in profits.
But Toys "R" Us, which sells more than 25 percent of the stuffed animals, video games, dolls and other toys sold in America, defied the depressing trend in retail earnings in the second quarter, when its profits skyrocketed 39.7 percent. 
 Following are details of the retailers' profits:
 
Kmart

Kmart, which operates Kmart discount stores as well as several specialty retail chains, said its earnings rose to $168 million, or 37 cents a share, from $163 million, or 40 cents a share, during the similar period last year. Earnings per share were diluted by the greater number of shares outstanding at the end of this year's second quarter.
Sales increased 8.8 percent, to $9.14 billion, from $8.40 billion in the second quarter of 1991.
Wall Street analyst's estimates of Kmart's second-quarter earnings ranged from 37 cents a share to 42 cents a share, with a mean of 40 cents a share, according to Bloomberg Business News.
Joseph E. Antonini, chairman and chief executive of Kmart, said cautious spending patterns and colder than normal weather that stymied sales of apparel and gardening equipment had hampered the company's performance.
Kmart's strongest sales came in July, when the weather was warmer, but July typically is a highly promotional month, used by retailers to clear out spring and summer merchandise. Consequently, the company's profit margins in the second quarter slipped 1 percent, to 23.9 percent of sales.
Some analysts were concerned by the faltering pace of sales and profits from Kmart's PACE Membership Warehouse stores, which contributed 2 percent of the company's overall profits in 1991. Although PACE did better than its competitors in the warehouse industry, with a 10.9 percent increase in sales at stores open at least one year, its sales were still below plan in the second quarter, Mr. Antonini said.
 
Tiffany
 Tiffany's net income dived to $3.9 million, or 25 cents a share, from $7.2 million, or 46 cents a share, in 1991, which was worse than most analysts had expected. Sales for the quarter that ended July 31 rose to $120.8 million from $119.4 million a year earlier.
William R. Chaney, Tiffany's chairman, said the company continued to struggle against weak economic and retail conditions. Its costs also increased 11.5 percent as it continues a major expansion of stores throughout the United States.
Tiffany's United States operations, which had flat sales in the second quarter, were hit by a declining number of tourists, who account for a large portion of the volume of the company's stores. And internationally, the company's performance was hampered by declining sales to Mitsukoshi, the exclusive Japanese department store chain that sells Tiffany merchandise in Japan.
Given the luxury goods it sells, Tiffany needs a bigger improvement in the economy than most retailers to experience sales growth, analysts said.
"Over all, the outlook for the company is not very favorable when you combine the sluggish outlook for the U.S. economy with the severe downturn in the Japanese consumer markets," said Peter J. Caruso, a retail analyst with Merrill Lynch.
 
Toys "R" Us
 Toys "R" Us lifted its profits to $32.7 million, or 11 cents a share, during the quarter that ended Aug. 1, from $23.4 million, or 8 cents a share, last year. Sales grew 18 percent, to $1.3 billion.
Analysts' estimates of the company's second-quarter earnings ranged from 9 cents a share to 12 cents a share, according to Bloomberg Business News.
Charles Lazarus, chairman and chief executive of Toys "R" Us, said the outstanding growth in earnings reflected greater sales of classic toys like board games and baby dolls, which give the company higher profit margins and require less advertising and promotion than "hot" toys like video games. He said the company benefited from strong sales in its European stores and improving sales in its Canadian stores.

HEADLINE: American Chestnut Could Still Win Its Battle

BYLINE: By NATALIE ANGIER

 BODY:
PLANT pathologists hope they are on their way to one of their greatest victories, the resurrection of the magnificent American chestnut tree, a cousin of the oak and by some estimates far more beautiful.
The chestnut was long one of the dominant and most economically important hardwood trees on the Eastern Seaboard, its range extending from Maine to Alabama and west to the Mississippi. The chestnut grew quickly and flourished in thin, rocky soil that was inhospitable to many other trees, and its wood was exceptionally resistant to rot. 
 The tree's straight, imposing trunk proved an excellent source of timber, its chestnuts were harvested to feed livestock and produce flour, and its bark and wood provided abundant amounts of tannin, a chemical used to tan leather. Through the 18th and 19th centuries, entire industries and towns centered on the chestnut tree, particularly in Appalachia.
But in 1904, botanists at the Bronx Zoo in New York discovered that trees they had imported from the Far East were infected with chestnut blight, a bright orange fungus that kills trees by girdling the trunk and cutting off nutrients and water. The American chestnut tree had no resistance to the foreign pest and quickly succumbed.
 
A Way to Fight Back
 Dispersed by rain, insects and humans, the blight spread an estimated 25 miles per year up and down the coast. In less than 50 years, several billion mature chestnut trees had perished, and so, too, had the businesses that relied on them.
"It was the greatest ecological tragedy in recorded history," said Dr. William L. MacDonald, a chestnut expert at West Virginia University in Morgantown.
Now researchers may have created a way of battling the blight. It turns out that some surviving chestnut trees in the Midwest, as well as in Europe, are infected with a far less virulent strain of the blight. Analyzing the innocuous fungus, scientists have learned that it is itself afflicted by a pathogen, a type of virus called a double-stranded RNA virus, that somehow inhibits the fungus's growth and keeps it from killing a tree.
An attempt to use the natural form of the virus to control the blight does not appear to be feasible on a large scale, however, because the natural virus must be spread among the fungi by so-called vegetative fusing, and many strains of the blight are incompatible and will refuse to fuse.
To circumvent the problem, Dr. Gil H. Choi and Dr. Donald L. Nuss of the Roche Institute of Molecular Biology have fashioned a DNA version of the RNA virus and have prompted the DNA copy to integrate into the fungus chromosomes. In its new configuration, the virus can spread from one fungus to another by sexual reproduction involving two fungal cells, a far more assured event than vegetative fusion. Hence, there is no barrier to the virus's eventual dispersion throughout the entire population of blight because it crowds out the less virulent form genetically.
The scientists hope to expose chestnuts to the less virulent strain of fungus, essentially inoculating them by giving them a less harmless blight that will dominate over the virulent strain. In theory, chestnuts could be restored where they had once thrived.
Young sprouts of the trees cover the forest floors of many Eastern states and await only a break in the cover of other, taller hardwood trees, say by fire or lumbering, to begin growing toward the heavens. Right now, the trees would be killed by blight as they matured. But if the new, less virulent blight were released into the environment, the trees may be able to reach their former majesty.
The scientists at Roche anticipate that it will take three to five years to win permission to release the genetically altered fungus in even a small bit of forest.

HEADLINE: Astronomy's New Era Is Born in Poverty

BYLINE: By MALCOLM W. BROWNE

 BODY:
DESPITE America's historical and continuing lead in inventing new types of telescopes and other advanced instruments, astronomers charge that the failure of the Federal Government to provide dependable financial support has put American astronomy at a serious disadvantage in the competition with its counterparts in Europe and Japan.
Federal financing has flagged, they say, just as a stream of new telescopes and telescope-enhancing devices are ready to be exploited. Scientists expect the instruments to mark a new era of astronomy, vastly improving the ability of ground-based telescopes to peer through the distorting veil of the earth's atmosphere and increasing human understanding of the cosmos. Yet some American astronomers, including senior professionals as well as young postdoctoral researchers, are even leaving this country for better professional opportunities in Europe. 
 Paradoxically, the United States plans to build some of the largest and most advanced telescopes in the world. Designers hope to embellish them with devices that were originally invented and developed for such Defense Department programs as spy satellites and Strategic Defense Initiative weapons. But reduced Federal commitments to astronomy have made some of these projects uncertain at best.
Despite its importance and popular appeal, astronomy functions on a shoestring budget, compared with other fields of science. The National Optical Astronomy Observatories had a budget of $28.8 million for the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30; that money had to cover the operation of two major observatories in the United States and one in Chile.
Dr. Sidney C. Wolff, director of N.O.A.O., said that since 1984, financing for the agency, the Government's main vehicle for optical astronomy research, had actually declined by 15 percent when inflation was taken into account and that the prospects for the coming year were even worse. "Between 20 and 40 staff members are likely to have to be dropped," she said, "and while the European observatories can count on funding three or four years in advance, we have to live from year to year.
"We realize the need for big cuts in Federal spending, but it seems to me we've already paid more than our share," Dr. Wolff said.
The agency operates Kitt Peak Observatory in Arizona, the National Solar Observatory in New Mexico and the Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory in Chile. It also hopes to carry out a major new telescope project called Gemini, a joint project by the United States, Canada and Britain, who later enlisted Chile and Australia as junior contributors. But Australia may not be able to commit its share by the deadline of Oct. 1, so Congress may simply cut off the money for the project.
Financial and management problems for American astronomy are mounting just as an international race for leadership in astronomy is reaching full stride. Dr. Riccardo Giacconi, the chief scientist for the Hubble Space Telescope, charges that poor management of the America's space and astronomy programs has hobbled efforts to compete with European science.
Dr. Giacconi himself, a founder of X-ray astronomy and the current director of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, will soon join the brain drain. In January, Dr. Giacconi, an Italian-born American, will become the director of Europe's eight-nation astronomical consortium, the European Southern Observatory, and will concentrate on completing Europe's Very Large Telescope, the largest ground-based telescope project ever undertaken.
A wealth of new inventions and technologies, most of them developed in the United States, promises to bring about a revolution in astronomy. In principle, that should give the United States a strong competitive edge in its race with Europe and Japan. But, concurring in Dr. Giacconi's gloomy assessment, many American astronomers say that this nation's scientific institutions seem to be incapable of exploiting the discoveries and inventions of its own scientists and engineers to best advantage.
"We have very poor management," Dr. Giacconi said in an interview."We just don't seem able to exploit our intellectual and technological resources.
 
Reversing the Tide
 "Take my own particular field, X-ray astronomy," he said. "We Americans founded the field and were the world leaders in X-ray astronomy. But it's come to the point where everything new in the field is either Japanese or German. It's not that we didn't spend the money. It's just that we spent it wrong, we spent it poorly."
In past generations, the flow of astronomical talent was mainly from Europe to the United States. Some of the best-known American astronomers, including the Dutch-born discoverer of quasars, Dr. Maarten Schmidt of the California Institute of Technology, immigrated to the United States at a time "when American astronomy was at its zenith and the observation possibilities were mainly in this country," Dr. Giacconi said. "But that situation is no longer true. The pull on astronomers is in the other direction," he added.
Another astronomer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said: "The situation is reaching a crisis. The astronomical programs in this country, which are small potatoes compared with the proposed space station and the Superconducting Supercollider, are in danger of starving."
That assessment is supported by Dr. Roger Angel, a British astronomer at the University of Arizona's Steward Observatory. While Dr. Angel does not plan to return to Europe, he said significant numbers of American astronomers had already left. Among them is Dr. Jacques M. Beckers, a Dutch-born astronomer, who left a senior position as a planner of federally financed American telescopes to join the team building Europe's mighty V.L.T.
Another recent emigre from the American astronomical community is Dr. Steven Beckwith, formerly a prominent astronomer at Cornell University, who has joined Germany's Max Planck Institute of Astrophysics. According to Dr. Angel, American postdoctoral astronomy students who are unable to find jobs in the United States are also drifting to Europe. "One of my own postdocs, a very capable young astronomer, has left to join Dr. Beckwith in Germany," Dr. Angel said.
Why should the American taxpayer care where American astronomers choose to reside, as long as they do good work? Does it matter to astronomers where they work, provided they have access to the best possible tools of the trade?
"It does," Dr. Angel said. "I feel terrible about this trend. Astronomy was the first physical science in which America became preeminent. That happened in the 19th century at a time when Europeans led in almost all other fields of science, including chemistry. In the early 20th century, Europe was blazing trails in chemistry, relativity theory, quantum mechanics and many other sciences, but the United States could still claim to be first in astronomy, and it remained preeminent for a century. It really hurts to see Europe taking that lead away."
 
Waiting for Opportunity
 American astronomers using international telescopes are at another disadvantage. The observation time customarily allotted to an astronomer depends partly on his or her nationality; the higher the proportion of financing contributed by the astronomer's nation, the more time the scientist gets to use the telescope. The United States contributes little or nothing to most European telescopes, except for some jointly built observatories on United States soil.
Dr. Angel said excellence in astronomy was perceived by many as an attribute of national prestige.
"I served on the panel that looked into the optical error in the mirror of the Hubble Space Telescope," he said. "As an astronomer I had worried about the Hubble's gigantic cost, something like $2 billion. But on that panel I heard something really telling: that if the Hubble had worked as it was supposed to, the $2 billion would have been well worth the price for United States public relations alone, showing that we could still carry off a technological triumph brilliantly. As it turned out, of course, the public relations part of it backfired."
After the Hubble Space Telescope was launched in 1990, the scientists using it discovered that its heart, the concave mirror that collects and focuses light from the stars, had the wrong shape. Although the Hubble has proved much more scientifically productive than pessimists at first feared, the telescope will not operate as it was intended unless a space shuttle mission planned for next year installs corrective optics, similar in principle to eyeglasses.
The race for better telescopes has two aspects: making telescopes bigger and making them better.
From the time it was inaugurated in 1948 until the present, the largest operating American telescope has been the 200-inch-diameter instrument at Palomar, Calif. Nevertheless, the smaller telescopes built since Palomar have improved immensely, mainly because of an American invention called the charge-coupled device. C.C.D.'s were invented at A.T.&T. Bell Laboratories in the late 1960's and were first put to use mainly in military hardware, like night-vision devices and spy satellites.
It was not until 1975 that scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the University of Arizona demonstrated the devices' potential use in astronomical telescopes. Their main advantage over both photographic emulsions and vidicon television cameras is that C.C.D.'s can capture the very faintest light, of any wavelength, and generate a precisely amplified electronic record that can be viewed on a video screen. The human eye, a remarkably efficient light detector, registers only about 1 percent of the photons of light it encounters, while a C.C.D. chip converts up to 90 percent of the incident photons into electronic counterparts.
 
Telescopes Get Stronger
 When C.C.D. detectors replaced conventional photographic plates in most astronomical telescopes during the 1980's, the telescopes' light-gathering power increased enormously, almost as if their mirrors had been enlarged to many times their actual sizes. Important discoveries ensued, yielding insights into the nature of quasars, the formation of galaxies and the large-scale structure of the universe. America's costly but wonderful C.C.D.'s opened a golden decade of astronomical discovery, in which modified telescopes rather than new ones were the tools.
By the end of the 1980's, the benefits of the C.C.D. had been exploited to the maximum, so still greater light-gathering power was needed to push farther into the unknown. The only way to achieve this was by building larger telescopes, and the race to do that is now in full swing.
But bigger telescopes mean much bigger technological problems. A major problem for a traditional reflecting telescope is the effect of turbulent air inside an observatory dome and inside the open structure of the telescope itself. To compensate for this, new telescopes are being made as short as possible to fit inside small, well-ventilated domes. That, of course, means using mirrors with much great curvatures than the conventional kinds.
Dr. Angel has devised an approach to making such mirrors. The Angel system uses a rotating electric furnace about the size and speed of a carnival carousel. Chunks of optical glass imported from Japan are loaded on the furnace's turntable mold; as the temperature rises toward the melting point of glass, the platform is set to spinning at a precisely controlled speed. When the glass is fully liquefied, centrifugal force pulls it away from the center toward the edge, resulting in a smooth, concave surface very close to the ultimate shape of the mirror.
A competing mirror system will be used in Europe's V.L.T., the telescope that Dr. Giacconi will be directing. That system depends on computer-controlled mechanical devices pushing and pulling the back of each mirror to maintain its perfect optical shape. The four "meniscus mirrors," eight meters (26 feet) in diameter, being cast for the V.L.T. are much thinner and more flexible than conventional telescope mirrors. The system needed to keep them in shape while the telescope is tracking a celestial object is extremely complex.
The new Keck Telescope's 10-meter (33-foot) mirror, made of 36 independently mounted segments, is also kept in shape by active optics; astronomers have high hopes for this American giant.
If N.O.A.O. secures the needed financing, the agency hopes to build Gemini, a project involving two telescopes, each with an eight-meter mirror, in Hawaii and Chile. Although financing for the second telescope remains uncertain, if the project goes forward, Dr. Angel's spin-casting carousel may make the mirrors.
Despite the ingenious technology that has become available for advanced astronomical telescopes, "America will only remain competitive in astronomy if its managers resolve to back the science with consistent funding and wisely planned programs," Dr. Giacconi said. "As it is, American astronomy is only about on a par with that of Italy. That makes me proud, as an Italian-American, but I'd like to see us do better."

HEADLINE: The Republicans: Unchanged

 BODY:
The platform that the Republican Convention adopted yesterday in Houston rings with partisan passion, but as a document to promote President Bush's campaign for re-election it lands with a disappointing thud.
Americans everywhere are grumbling over economic stagnation and long for new ideas. This platform supplies a ritualistic roster of old ones -- dogma that's not only tired but also discredited. By comparison, the 1992 Democratic program floats, lighter than air, on some utopian assumptions about growth. But at least it's a program. 
 Just how much the public wants action is dramatically documented in the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll. Does the country need real change? An astounding 92 percent of the public answered "yes." Would electing Bill Clinton bring about real change? Fully 63 percent answered "yes." Would re-electing President Bush bring about real change? A mere 15 percent said "yes."
So what bold ideas does the platform advance? None. The Republicans proclaim their enduring devotion to a balanced budget amendment. They call for reneging on the 1990 Congressional budget agreement to hold down the deficit. They embrace deregulation so eagerly that they almost claim credit for President Carter's monumental oil and gas deregulation. And they embrace supply-side economics with a zeal that erases the memory of the huge Reagan-Bush deficits.
Underlying all the platform's economic proposals are two convictions: that tax hikes, for whatever purpose, hurt the economy; and that private investment is productive while public spending is inherently wasteful.
The Republicans surely have a strong argument that the proposals for public investments advocated by the Democrats could easily turn into euphemisms for old-fashioned pork if President Bush were not on hand with vigilant vetoes.
But the Republicans drive their argument out the window.
The test for investment is not whether it is private or public but whether it is productive. In truth, studies show that public investments -- wisely selected -- make substantial contributions to economic growth. Public investments in highways, fiber-optic telecommunications and training for disadvantaged workers can boost productivity more than equal amounts of private investment. The platform takes the cramped view that taxpayers see no benefit in helping educate other people's children; but most Americans aren't that shortsighted.
The platform writers have not seen a tax cut they don't like, a tax hike they don't despise. Mr. Clinton's proposed hike in payroll taxes to finance worker training is automatically wrong; yet tax giveaways to upper-income families or real estate investors are presumed to promote productivity.
The Republican platform rehearses the G.O.P.'s greatest hits. That may placate conservatives. But it will do little, in this financially fearful time, to address most Americans' fears.

Bonhoeffer Tribute
Union Theological Seminary
Last year, the Union Theological Seminary commissioned three composers to write works in honor of Dietrich Bonhoeffer, the German theologian and resistance figure who was executed in 1945 after participating in a plot to assassinate Hitler. On Sunday afternoon in the seminary's James Memorial Chapel, the three works were given their world premieres under the collective title "Altar Triptych for Bonhoeffer."
The concert celebrated Bonhoeffer both as a symbol of moral fortitude and for his connections with the seminary. He studied there in the early 1930's and returned briefly in 1939, before deciding that it was his responsibility to work in Germany. There he took the dangerous position that "only those who cry out for the Jews may also sing Gregorian chant." Now the seminary is raising $2 million to endow a Bonhoeffer Chair in Theology and Ethics. 
 The commissions were carefully ecumenical: Herman Berlinski, a Jewish composer who was born in Leipzig and has lived in the United States since 1941, provided the first panel, "Das Gebet Bonhoeffers" ("Bonhoffer's Prayer"). Heinz Werner Zimmermann, a Protestant organist who works in Frankfurt, composed the central panel, "Neujahrslied" ("New Year's Song"). And the concluding piece, "Cross and Freedom: Cantata for All Time," was composed by Robert M. Helmschrott, a Catholic organist from Munich.
The composers drew their texts mostly from the Bible and from Bonhoeffer's letters and poetry. All were sung in German, except for a quotation from Auden's "Friday's Child" in Mr. Helmschrott's work.
Mr. Berlinski's work reflected on Bonhoeffer's prison thoughts, his hope to be reconciled with his fiancee, and his prayers for salvation, both his own and the world's. Verses were presented by alternating groups. A soprano was accompanied by a flute and a celesta, a baritone by a cello and light percussion, the choir by the organ. Mr. Berlinski's writing is graceful, attractive, sometimes harmonically tense, and remarkably economical: the contrasts in spirit between the vocal and instrumental lines gave an impression of resolved tensions and emotional depth.
Mr. Zimmermann's piece, a straightforward choral setting of Bonhoeffer's poem "Von guten Machten" ("Powers of Good") with a Faure-like gentleness, is a serene centerpiece. And Mr. Helmschrott's four-movement cantata, the most expansive and colorfully scored of the works, also had the greatest intensity and drama.
The works were performed by members of the Dresden Chamber Choir, the Handel Choir of Baltimore, the Shir Chadash Chorale of Washington, and the Mount Vernon Chamber Orchestra. Hans-Christoph Rademann, the director of the Dresden group, conducted, and also led his choir in ravishing performances of works by Schutz, Bach and Brahms. There were also short compositions by Mr. Berlinski and by Mr. Helm schrott, for which the composers served as organist.

HEADLINE: A Profitable Insurer Gets Respect

BYLINE: By PETER KERR

 BODY:
While other large multiline insurance companies continue to stagger from real estate losses and weak markets, M. R. Greenberg's tightly run international empire, American International Group, last month reported results so characteristically positive that Wall Street once again greeted them with a yawn. Many analysts take for granted that A.I.G., under Mr. Greenberg, its chairman and chief executive, is the smartest and most successful large insurance company in America.
But on Wall Street, Mr. Greenberg is also something of a terror. 
 So formidable is his presence in the small community of insurance industry analysts and investment bankers that in a dozen recent interviews all but one insisted on not being quoted by name when discussing Mr. Greenberg, including those who had only positive things to say.
 Many said they feared that A.I.G.'s 67-year-old chairman might take offense at the slightest criticism. One wrong step, they said, and Mr. Greenberg would direct a blast at their bosses, or they would be cut off from Mr. Greenberg and A.I.G. as a valuable source of industry information and analysis.
Although analysts stressed that the company would receive excellent reviews in any case, they said that Mr. Greenberg had managed to make them hesitant to be the first publicly to question A.I.G. and its prospects for the future.
"His grasp of the industry and where it is going seems almost omniscient," said Myron Picoult, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Company. "But, yes, he can be very intimidating."
Indeed, few challenge Mr. Greenberg's recent decisions to enlarge the company's presence in areas that the industry considers unpromising and unprofitable. With little fanfare, for example, A.I.G. has been slowly increasing its involvement in personal automobile insurance in the last year by investing in a company that specializes in inner-city auto claims. And Mr. Greenberg says he expects a major push in this decade into the life insurance business in the United States, which he avoided in the glory years of the 1970's and 1980's
"If you ask what is today's global financial powerhouse, I'd argue it's not American Express, it's not Citibank, it's A.I.G.," said Michael Frinquelli, an analyst at Salomon Brothers. "This is a big company but when you look at the piece of the market they control worldwide it is tiny. There is still a lot of room for growth."
Perhaps analysts' confidence stems from the fact that since Mr. Greenberg took charge 24 years ago, A.I.G. has outshone other American insurers by keeping down costs with an iron discipline and spotting niches for growth where no one else saw them. A.I.G. has concentrated on strict underwriting and finding sometimes obscure market niches like insurance covering kidnappings and ransoms, oil rigs, and directors' and officers' liabilities.
Profits have grown from $17.2 million in 1968 to $1.5 billion in 1991 on revenues of nearly $17 billion. The stock of A.I.G. has risen mightily in the last decade, up more than four times its 1981 level. But the share price has been meandering in a range of $72 to $101 for the last 18 months.
Yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, the shares closed at $97.125, down 37.5 cents. As of January of this year Mr. Greenberg owned 4.7 million shares, or 2.2 percent of the stock.
Visitors to Mr. Greenberg's office on Pine Street in the financial district of Manhattan are confronted with one of New York's world-class power walls: there are five photos of President Bush with A.I.G.'s chairman, four Ronald Reagans, two Henry Kissingers, one Jimmy Carter, one Gerald Ford, a Corazon Aquino, a Ferdinand Marcos and a Deng Xiaoping. There is also an autographed Harry S. Truman.
On the afternoon of a recent interview, Mr. Greenberg allowed a visitor several minutes to take in his office before he entered, a short, trim man with a gentle voice and a disarming smile. Asked about his effect on analysts, Mr. Greenberg responded with a quizzical shrug: "What can I tell you about what goes on in people's heads?"
 
Overseas Roots
 A.I.G., whose roots go back to a tiny insurance office established in Shanghai, China, in 1919, is now the pre-eminent underwriter of big-ticket commercial insurance in the United States and the only American insurance company with nearly half its business overseas. The company has ridden the growth of foreign economies, particularly in Asia, something that other American insurers have generally lacked the desire or expertise to do.
Last quarter, earnings from A.I.G.'s mostly international life insurance business surged 16 percent, supported in particular by growth in Southeast Asia and Japan. In Malaysia and Thailand, for example, life insurance earnings grew 39 and 24 percent, respectively. The multiline carriers like Aetna, Travelers and Cigna, meanwhile, continued to report bad news as a result of the real estate investments in their domestic life insurance businesses.
A.I.G.'s Financial Services, which includes worldwide investment banking, asset management and airplane leasing, showed a 65.6 percent increase in pretax operating income, compared with the corresponding period last year.
In the weak property-casualty business, where companies are suffering from seemingly endless low prices caused by competition in commercial liability lines, A.I.G.'s operating income was down 3 percent in the quarter compared with last year. But its performance in that area remained stronger than that of most competitors, in large part because it kept its operating expenses at 20 percent, about 10 percentage points below the industry average.
 
Assertive Personality
 Mr. Greenberg's persona seems to define the company, from the advertisements in national magazines like The Atlantic and Newsweek that rail against the nation's policies on litigation and environmental waste (issues that are critical to the company's future) to sharp-tongued telephone calls that his executives can expect to receive on any day of the week, from anywhere in the world. Mr. Greenberg refuses to join insurance trade organizations and occasionally makes cracks about the low average intelligence of others in the industry.
On Wall Street, many analysts say that Mr. Greenberg, a United States Army Ranger in World War II, can attack with a forcefulness that is highly unusual in the traditionally soft-spoken industry.
They point to the case of Michael A. Smith, a Shearson Lehman analyst who in February 1990 wrote some mildly critical comments about TransAtlantic Holdings, a reinsurance company that did business with A.I.G. and in which A.I.G. had a 41 percent stake.
A.I.G.'s protests included a vehement letter from Mr. Greenberg to Shearson's chief operating officer, Howard L. Clark Jr. Less than a month later, Shearson, in a highly unusual move, put out another report summarizing and quoting Mr. Greenberg's objections without offering any additional commentary.
"We spoke with him," Mr. Greenberg said of Mr. Smith, "and said we think this is wrong, and he refused to make a change until we spoke to his boss about a change."
Mr. Smith said that Shearson's second report was not a retraction and that his superiors had put no pressure on him to alter his conclusions.
In another case, in 1990, Public Citizen, the Washington-based consumer group associated with Ralph Nader, published a report questioning the solvency of A.I.G. and four other insurers -- a report that was criticized by many experts. But it was Mr. Greenberg alone among industry executives who held a news conference to protest; hired Floyd Abrams, a prominent First Amendment lawyer, and threatened to sue. Public Citizen soon issued a news release saying it did not, in fact, mean to say that A.I.G. could become insolvent.
"There are very few people who have the stomach to cross him," one prominent analyst said. "He has the memory of an elephant and there is the fear that he will make it difficult for you to do business with him again."
Sitting in his paneled office, Mr. Greenberg asserted that he was simply aggressive in correcting errors about A.I.G. "I suppose," he said, "we are very passionate about what we believe in."
The great unknowns on the company's future are the outcome of toxic- waste cleanup litigation, which could result in hundreds of billions of dollars in unpredicted costs to insurers like A.I.G., and the matter of who will take over after Mr. Greenberg retires.
Mr. Greenberg, as he often has in the past, declined to say who his successor might be or when he would retire, although he has hinted that his retirement is not imminent. He also said it was impossible to estimate how high the cost of environmental cleanups could eventually be for the company. It is a subject, he acknowledged, "I think about when I go to sleep; I think about when I wake up."
Mr. Greenberg said that the company for the first time sees great opportunities in the domestic life insurance business. Until now, the business has made up only 1 percent to 5 percent of its life insurance operating income, but Mr. Greenberg has assembled a team to expand on his belief that in the next decade it could account for more than 20 percent of A.I.G.'s life insurance operating income.
Many experts argue that the life insurance market has passed its prime because of demographic shifts like the aging of the baby boomers. But Mr. Greenberg disagrees. "You can get better margins than a few years ago because people are more interested in security than reaching for the more competitive product," he said. "Where there is a troubled field there are opportunities."

CORRECTION-DATE: August 22, 1992, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Tuesday about the success of American International Group misstated some of the company's results. Its new life insurance premiums grew 39 percent in Malaysia and 24 percent in Thailand last year. The figures did not represent earnings increases.

HEADLINE: Report Finds An Embattled Crown Hts.

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL

 BODY:
With an edgy Crown Heights marking the anniversary of last summer's racially charged disturbances, a coalition of community leaders has taken a second look at the neighborhood and found a community suffering from high unemployment, AIDS, an overwhelming influx of immigrants and overtaxed city services.
The report, prepared by 40 educators, civic leaders and clergyman in an effort to examine the underlying causes of the disturbances, also called youth services in Crown Heights "grossly inadequate." A third of 235,000 residents of Crown Heights are under the age of 24. 
 The study by the Crown Heights Coalition was one of many efforts to commemorate the victims of last summer's violence in this community, where blacks and Hasidic Jews live a tense coexistence. At St. Anthony Baptist Church, several hundred people gathered last night for a memorial service for Gavin Cato, the 7-year-old boy who was killed last year when a car from the entourage of the Lubavitch Hasidic spiritual leader spun out of control and jumped a curb. The accident touched off four days of violence.
 
'It Is a Shame'
 Outside the church, vans full of police officers lined the streets, and nearby, hidden behind a park, scores of officers waited with riot gear. Inside, the Rev. Al Sharpton condemned the criminal justice system because a grand jury failed to indict the driver of the car.
"It is a shame that any child died," he said, as some in the audience shouted their agreement. "It is more than a shame when nothing is done about the death of a child."
He then led about 300 demonstrators on a peaceful candle-lighted march for four blacks to President Street, where the boy was struck and died.
Echoing complaints from last year, several marchers contended that the Hasidic community received preferential treatment from the police and the city.
The report by the Crown Heights Coalition also touched on the persistent racial divide in the community. It found that the Jewish youths it surveyed thought that police services in their community were good, while the black and Hispanic youths felt they were "very poor." The 686 youths who were questioned for that part of the study were randomly selected from local high schools.
The report did not examine the attitudes and perceptions that black and Hasidic residents have toward each other; instead it outlined the social problems of the inner-city neighborhood as a whole. The violence last summer, the 80-page report noted, "reflected the anger and alienation, aggravated over time of different communities within Crown Heights who believe their urgent social needs were being ignored."
The report, which was commissioned by Borough President Howard Golden, is to be released today at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden during an official ceremony to commemorate the victims of the violence. The trouble began on the night of Aug. 19, 1991, when a car in the motorcade of the Lubavitch spiritual leader, Rebbe Menachem M. Schneerson, jumped a curb, killing Gavin Cato, and seriously injuring his 7-year-old cousin, Angela Cato.
Three hours later, in what the authorities have called revenge, a 29-year-old Hasidic scholar, Yankel Rosenbaum, was stabbed five blocks away by a band of black youths. He died later at Kings County Hospital. For four days the Brooklyn community was engulfed in violence.
 
'No Justice, No Peace'
 The marchers last night, led by Mr. Sharpton, the Rev. Herbert Daughtry, and the Cato family, were peaceful, chanting, "No justice, no peace," and "Whose streets? Our streets," as they moved to the corner of President Street and Utica Avenue, and placed candles and a wreath near a faded red cross painted on the sidewalk to mark the spot where Gavin Cato was killed.
Scores of people lined Utica Avenue, watching the demonstration. "I can't afford to protest," said Al Johnson, 20, who said he was arrested when he participated in a march last year. "I think it's right for them to protest but they should do it in a decent way."
The lone confrontation last night occurred when a Hasidic man, Mark Cohen, waded into the demonstrators, saying he wanted to hear Mr. Sharpton. "Get out of here. Get out of here," the black demonstrators shouted at him, and he was escorted away by the police.
By 10 P.M., about 50 demonstrators remained on President Street across from a unity mural recently painted by black and Hasidic artists. They chanted approvingly when some in the group smeared white paint across all the white faces on the mural.
Last week, Rabbi Shmuel Butman, one of the Lubavitch leaders, called on Mayor David N. Dinkins to ban any demonstrations in Crown Heights during the anniversary period, but he later backed away from the request.
"We are concerned, we are very concerned," Rabbi Butman said yesterday. "Basically what we want is the right to live and for the women and children to walk in security and safety in our community."
Late yesterday afternoon, David Elnakam, who identified himself as the national director of the Jewish militant group Kahane Chai, said 50 armed members of his organization were patrolling Crown Heights.
In the year since Crown Heights erupted in violence, the Crown Heights Coalition has labored to achieve some measure of understanding between blacks in the community, and the Lubavitch Hasidim, an ultra orthodox Jewish sect that has its world headquarters on Eastern Parkway in Crown Heights.
The coalition's report found that in some parts of Crown Heights, AIDS has become the third leading cause of death, killing 511 males per 100,000, according to figures compiled in 1988. Citywide AIDS was also the third leading cause of death, but the rate of death for males was lower, at 333 per 100,000, according to Marilyn Gelber, the executive assistant to Mr. Golden.
The coalition reported that unemployment among men, in Crown Heights, according to the 1990 census, was at 13.2 percent, compared with 10.6 percent overall for Brooklyn. The study said the 22,000 immigrants who moved to Crown Heights in recent years had strained the capacity of nearly every day-care center in the community. Crown Heights's public schools are the fourth most crowded in the city.
The coalition called for creation of a New Deal-style Crown Heights Youth Corps that would employ teen-agers to work as crisis prevention counselors and in neighborhood cleanup projects. It also urged, among other points, that Crown Heights get prevention and treatment programs for AIDS; that conflict resolution programs be put in the schools; that "Safe Corridors" under extra police protection be created for students walking to neighborhood schools, and that police officers be required to live in New York City.
Rabbi Shea Hecht, the co-chairman of the coalition along with Dr. Edison O. Jackson, the president of Medgar Evers College, said the group's greatest achievement was that Hasidic and black representatives had worked together for a year and "that we were able to understand some of the difficulties of the other community."
"To make the difference on the street," he added, "will take a long time."

HEADLINE: Sluggish Trading Ends With Dow Up 4.59

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The stock market finished higher in sluggish trading yesterday despite losses in share prices abroad and a worse-than-expected Government economic report.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 4.59, to 3,329.48. Advancing issues outnumbered declines, 9 to 8, on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 Volume on the Big Board came to a moderate 171.8 million shares, up from 152.8 million in the previous session.
Share prices held up well despite negative signals from the economy and foreign stock markets, said Gordon Wilson, senior vice president with Kemper Financial Services Inc. The Commerce Department reported that housing starts in July fell 2.8 percent.
Traders apparently took their cue from rising bond prices. The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose 3/8 point, pushing down its yield to 7.33 percent.
A few earnings reports and other corporate news moved individual stocks yesterday, but there was no apparent broad movement in the market.
The most actively traded Big Board issues included Kroger, which fell 1 7/8, to 11 5/8. Kroger, a supermarket operator, said its third-quarter results might be no better than break even.
Among other active issues, Toys "R" Us rose 1 1/2, to 38 1/2, after reporting a 61 percent jump in second-quarter earnings.
Hewlett-Packard fell 3 3/8, to 57 1/4, after reporting disappointing third-quarter earnings.
CMS Energy fell 1/4, to 15 1/2, after Oxford Energy said it was seeking Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors following a breakdown in talks with a CMS unit. Oxford also said it was unable to repay CMS loans.
Aetna Life and Casualty fell 7/81, to 43 1/8, after saying it would post a smaller-than-expected profit on the $1.4 billion sale of its American Re-Insurance Company subsidiary.
 
A Solid Earnings Gain
 In over-the-counter trading, System Software rose 2 5/8, to 26 5/8, after announcing solid third-quarter earnings.
The New York Stock Exchange's composite index rose 0.30, to 231.90. On the American Stock Exchange, the market-value index lost 0.13, to 386.81. The Nasdaq index fell 1.60, to 570.87.

3 Wishes: Ways for Bush to Prime Economy

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
With unemployment seemingly stuck near 8 percent and consumers guarding their paychecks as if each would be the last, is George Bush fated to play out the election campaign as Herbert Hoover to Bill Clinton's rendition of F.D.R.?
The White House has taken pains to scotch rumors that he would announce some dramatic initiative for jump-starting the economy. And some economists hope they mean what they say, arguing that the present course is the best course for a stable, noninflationary economy. 
 But many of Mr. Bush's supporters think otherwise. While there are infinite variations on what the President might do to try to win public confidence in his economic prowess, three alternatives stand out:
 
1981 All Over Again
 Within months of entering the White House, Ronald Reagan persuaded Congress to slash taxes, setting the stage for seven years of economic growth. Only in the late 1980's, when old-fashioned Republicans ganged up with liberal Democrats to resume the tax-and-spend policies of the past, did the economy run out of gas.
That, at any rate, is how Jack Kemp, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and other supply-siders see it. Mr. Kemp, along with six New Right members of Congress, are pressing the President to embrace the supply-side revolution as his own. This would include an across-the-board tax cut, a freeze in discretionary Government spending, radical welfare reform and a zero-inflation target for the Fed.
But the President's invitation to a supply-side party does not guarantee that anyone would attend, says Rudolph Penner, an economist at KPMG Peat Marwick. Most of the supply-side agenda would require legislation, and there is little reason to think Congress would entertain radical reforms of any sort before the election.
Indeed, much of what Mr. Kemp proposes has already been rejected by the legislators. Yet another brushoff could backfire, leaving the impression that Mr. Bush is an ineffectual leader. Or worse, a dissembling one. The President's advisers, who think the supply-siders are intellectual lightweights, would only advance supply-side initiatives that were sure to die. "Four years ago George Bush's word was his bond," said Jude Wanniski, president of Polyconomics, a consulting firm in Morristown, N.J. "Now the voters demand collateral."
Mr. Wanniski, who spearheaded the supply-siders' 1980 assault on Washington, has the collateral in mind. He believes the President could index capital gains to prices by executive order, cutting the effective tax rate with the stroke of a pen.
The effect would be striking. A share of stock purchased for $100 in 1979, for example, would be taxed only on the gain above $200, since the price level has since doubled. Milton Friedman, who teaches at Stanford's Hoover Institution, argued that the Administration had been "stupid" to pursue lower capital gains taxes when "indexing the base makes more sense economically and politically."
The obstacle, apart from Mr. Bush's innate caution, is a legal one. C. Boyden Gray, the White House counsel, has ruled that the President does not have the authority to index capital gains. But Lawrence Zelenak, a professor of law at the University of North Carolina, thinks a determined President could succeed in stretching his powers. "Despite the invalidity of regulatory indexing," he wrote in the May 11, 1992, issue of Tax Notes, "indexing would probably be immune from judicial challenge" because no one could make the case they had been injured by the initiative.
 
The Radical Middle
 If George Bush loses the election, goes the now-familiar refrain, it is because he could not coax back the suburbanites and blue-collar elite, sometime-Republicans who defected to Ross Perot. One way to win them over would be to adopt Mr. Perot's take-no-prisoners program for eliminating the budget deficit in five years.
But the Perot plan relied on tax increases and cuts in social entitlement spending. Thus in wooing votes from the radicalized middle, Mr. Bush might further alienate those stung by his betrayal of the read-my-lips pledge. And it would certainly anger affluent retirees who would take home less Social Security and pay more for health care. The Perot initiative "appeals to budget nerds like me," Mr. Penner said. But any plan that "asks for short-term suffering in the name of long-term gains is politically risky," he concluded.
There is also the worry that it would lengthen the recession. In the long run, a smaller deficit would free resources for private investment, lowering interest rates and presumably increasing growth. But it is hardly the medicine of choice for smoothing the business cycle. "I would be happy to wake up in five years with a 50-cent gas tax," said Robert Solow of M.I.T. But the immediate effect of Federal tax increases, he noted, would be fewer jobs and less income.
 
Born-Again Keynesianism
 "We are all Keynesians now," Richard Nixon concluded in 1971. Fiscal fine-turning is again out of fashion, at least in Republican circles. But by advocating tax cuts or spending increases, President Bush might connect with the people who count most -- voters who fear for their jobs. And by dressing it up in supply-side rhetoric he might make it palatable to the right. "Distinguishing between Keynesian and supply-side stimulus is a matter of spin and timing," said Benjamin Friedman of Harvard.
The President would not have to look far, were he so inclined. An appeal signed by 100 economists this spring called for a swift disbursal of cash to state and local governments to prevent cutbacks in construction projects. Mr. Bush might add some job-stimulating tax breaks.
The one big drawback: no direct impact before the election. "The action might not be visible for six months," Mr. Solow conceded.
Will the White House go for broke anytime soon? "They're in the grip of timidity and paralysis," Mr. Wanniski said, and they hope to increase the President's clout by tried and true means. "They'll hand off through the right tackle, " he concluded, "when they should be throwing bombs."

Excerpts From the Remarks By Housing Secretary Kemp

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Aug. 18

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from remarks tonight by Housing Secretary Jack F. Kemp at the Republican National Convention, as transcribed by Reuters.
Several months ago -- several months ago I had lunch with the former Mayor of Moscow. I asked him how he got elected. He said, "Mr. Kemp, I told all the people in state-owned housing that they should have the right to own their own home. I told them they should have the right to sell them for a profit and leave their property to their children." And then the Mayor of Moscow said, "I pledged to make downtown Moscow a free enterprise zone." I said Mr. Mayor, where did you get these radical ideas? He said, "Mr. Kemp, I got them from the 1980 Republican platform of Ronald Reagan and George Bush." 
 Ladies and gentlemen, communism didn't fall. It was pushed. It was our ideas that did the pushing and our Republican Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush that helped change the world. Now we must change America.
Our goals for this nation must be nothing less than to double the size of our economy and bring prosperity and jobs, ownership and equality of opportunity to all Americans, especially those living in our nation's pockets of poverty.
Think of what that growth would mean: more jobs, a higher living standard for the people, extraordinary opportunities for all Americans, and the resources to meet our most ambitious goals, public and private.
But make no mistake. If we are to change America, we must change the United States Congress.
We must give President Bush . . . and Vice President Quayle a Republican Congress to help get America moving again and finally wage a winning war against poverty and despair. 

 	 	 		. . .	 	My fellow Americans, the liberal Democrats just don't get it. They don't understand that you can't create more employees without first creating more employers, that you can't have capitalism without capital, and we can't expect people to defend property rights when they're denied access to property. But when people have a stake in the system, they'll not only defend their own property, they'll help their neighbor defend his property as well.
You see, you see, this is the message of Los Angeles. This is the message of every other pocket of poverty in America. We must be the party that gives all people a stake in the system, and a stake in each other. That's what the re-election of George Bush means to America. . . .
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a great cause. We've got a great team. And let me say as an old football player who played in this very stadium: we've got a great quarterback in George Bush.
And, Mr. President, give them hell Thursday night.

Excerpts From Keynote Address by Phil Gramm

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from remarks last night by Senator Phil Gramm of Texas at the Republican National Convention, as transcribed by The New York Times.
When you count up the number of nations liberated from Soviet tyranny -- when you total up the population freed from the Marxist yoke -- when you add up the puppet despots whose support from Moscow has now been yanked away, ours is the greatest victory in the history of freedom. 
 It was Ronald Reagan who put the Kremlin in the cross hairs but it was George Bush who pulled the trigger.
If Jimmy Carter -- if Jimmy Carter had been re-elected in 1980, if Walter Mondale had won in 1984, if Michael Dukakis had been elected President in 1988, the Berlin Wall would still be standing today. And all we marvel at in the world today would be a wishful dream. Leadership is the difference. It has changed the world, it has brought us more than peace; George Bush's leadership has brought us victory.
With this victory secured, President Bush instituted a long-term build-down in defense, saving $300 billion for deficit reduction and tax cuts for working families.
But Governor Clinton and the Democrats don't want to build down defense, they want to tear it down. If they succeed in implementing the Clinton plan, one million people now in uniform and civilian defense jobs will be thrown into the streets and defense -- and defense as a percentage of the budget will plunge below the level that existed on Dec. 7 of 1941.
We have not forgotten that the last Democrat in the White House so decimated defense that on any given day, 50 percent of our planes couldn't fly and our ships couldn't sail, because we didn't have spare parts and mechanics. So bad was pay for the military that many enlisted personnel and their families qualified for food stamps.
Under Republican leadership, we changed all that. We modernized our weapons and we recruited and have retained the finest young men and women who have ever worn the uniform of this country. And they wear that uniform all over the world tonight with a new pride and a new confidence, and we Republicans are committed to keeping it that way.
We must never -- we must never allow the Democrats to disarm America again.
There are tyrants in the world and there will be tyrants in the future. And when reason and diplomacy fail, we must have an Army and a Navy, and an Air Force, and a Marine corps that do not fail. Even in a world where the lion and the lamb are about to lie down together, we Republicans are committed to the principle that the United States of America must always be the lion.

 	 	 		. . .	 	To fight back against the drug thugs who prey off the health, happiness and lives of our children, 1,161 days ago today, the President sent Congress the nation's toughest anti-crime/anti-drug bill. It restored the Federal death penalty. Under our bill, no matter who your daddy is or how society has done you wrong, if you sell drugs to a child you're going to jail and you're going to serve every day of 10 years in a Federal penitentiary. And when you finally get out of prison, if you do it again, you're going back to prison and this time you're going back for life.
Had Congress said yes, we would have grabbed the drug thugs by the throat. But the Democrats said no.
You see, the Democrats still blame society, not criminals, for crime! And not content with just gutting the President's bill, the Democrats went on to overturn 22 Supreme Court decisions that had strengthened law enforcement, that had empowered the cop on the beat to protect law-abiding citizens. So bad was their bill that 15 state Democrat attorneys general, not to mention 16 Republicans, urged the President to veto the Democrats' "pro-criminal" bill.
America's problem today, America's problem today is not that the President's plan to energize the economy has failed. Our problem is that it has not been tried. It is not that the President did not ask for change but that the Democrats who run Congress killed those changes. The President asked for the tools to put our people back to work. The President asked for the weapons to win back our streets. And the Democrats bent them and broke them and threw them away.
To paraphrase Winston Churchill: Give us the tools and we will finish the job. Give us a Republican Congress and we will put our people back to work and we will put criminals in jail where they belong.
Democrats, Democrats and Republicans agree on one thing: We both want change. The debate is not about who is for change; it's about the direction of the change. Today America stands at the crossroads. It's time for choosing: their way of more taxing or our way of more jobs; their way of more government or our way of more opportunity.
The change Republicans want today is to stop the growth of government, to bring spending under control, to balance the budget and to cut taxes again. The change the Democrats want is to go back to the tax and spend policies they gave us in the 70's, the last time there was a Democrat in the White House.
Did you notice that at their convention in New York, the Democrats hid their Congressional leaders? Poor -- poor Speaker Tom Foley and majority leader George Mitchell were hidden so far back in the crowd that you had to press your nose right up against the TV screen and get out a magnifying glass to see them.

 	 	 		. . .	 	At the New York convention, Clinton was like a used car salesman peddling his vehicle for change. The wax job was shiny, the hubcaps sparkled, the upholstery was spotless, the paint was new. But when you look under the hood, he's peddling a model from the 1970's: a Carter mobile with the axle broken and the frame bent to the left. It was a lemon for the nation; it was a lemon for the nation in the 1970's when it sent inflation through the roof and income through the floor, and it is a lemon for America today.

HEADLINE: UNDER THE DOME: On Stage;
A 32-Year Congressman Joins The Attack on His Colleagues

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KELLY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Aug. 18

 BODY:
A politician rarely does what he wants, but mostly he does what he must.
The House minority leader, Robert H. Michel, is 59 years old, and he has served in the House of Representatives for 32 years. The Democrats have controlled the House for every one of those years. But Mr. Michel, an affable man, always got along with them, and was always known as someone who took pride in the institution he has made his life's work. 
 But in a convention where criticizing Congress has become an obligatory part of the oratory, Mr. Michel did the necessary tonight, and smilingly trashed his home.
Denouncing what "38 years of misrule have done to an institution," Mr. Michel called Congress "a bloated bureaucracy," that could not "even run a branch Post Office." He went on about the disgrace of the House and for his troubles, won modest applause, and a few cheers.
 
What? Get Out of My Chair? And What's 'the Wave?'
 The floor of the Astrodome, where the delegates sit in neat rows of red chairs, is a decorous place. There is nothing at issue here -- nothing to vote on except a platform and two candidates about whom party debate is over -- and the hall is too big for the kind of crowding that helped the Democrats generate some sense of excitement.
It is left to the floor whips, well-groomed young men and women in green baseball hats, to enliven the crowd, cruising the aisles and trying to teach Republicans to act rowdy. It was an uphill job.
Most people remained seated, their emotions well under control. As Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts took to the stage, an effort was made among the Maryland and California delegates to stage a series of body "waves" as sports fans do without the aid of whips.
Even before they tried, however, there was a certain foreboding. "We're going to do a wave, but probably most folks here have never even been to a ball game," said a California delegate. "I think we're kind of nervous."
The first wave was weak and ragged. The second was considerably worse. By the fourth attempt the whips had given up.
 
The Very Thin Line Between Wit and Witlessness
 It was bound to be a problem. With 40 to 50 speakers a day all saying much the same thing -- Bill Clinton is no good and the Democrats are rotten to the core -- there must inevitably be a certain overreaching, a stepping across the line that divides oratory and inanity.
In the category of Most Cruelly Tortured Metaphor, the evening's winner was Gov. John Engler of Michigan, who, apparently driven by home-state pride, found himself in an endless string of automotive metaphors.
He began by suggesting "a look under the hood," of the President's record, went on to note that "the Clinton-Gore model is no Lincoln, it's a lemon" that had a "slick paint job" but that could "only turn left." And, he said, it had "already had a test drive in Arkansas" and done poorly.
The award for Most Awkward Observation was garnered by Commerce Secretary Barbara Hackman Franklin for claiming that Mr. Clinton's "whole vision of commerce has been shaped while on the Government payroll." Quite true, perhaps, but unfortunate for inviting comparison with Mr. Bush, who spent all but 4 of the last 28 years on the Government payroll.
A gaudy yet cheap trophy for Most Tasteless Line went to Governor Weld for a rumination that combined basic economics with basic biology: "The Democrats' taxing and spending habits remind me of that old definition of a baby: a huge appetite on one end and no sense of responsibility on the other."
An honorary Oscar went to the actor Bruce Willis, for his explanation of why he supported President Bush: "It's a big desk and I want someone who's had the experience of sitting behind it before."
The Grand Over All Overreacher Award, in a hands-down, no-contest triumph, was Senator Phil Gramm of Texas. "In any hut in any village on the planet," he said, "one world leader is loved, honored and admired above all others. Spoken in a thousand dialects, his name is George Bush."

HEADLINE: REPUBLICANS IN HOUSTON: News Analysis;
G.O.P. Is Flirting With the Dangers of Negativism

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Aug. 18

 BODY:
Richard N. Bond, the fiercely combative Republican chairman, says his party is fighting a "cultural war" with the Democrats. But there is also a cultural war taking place within the Republican ranks here, a war that pits conservatism with a snarl against conservatism with a smile.
Both are on display in the Astrodome this week, and both will probably be on display throughout the campaign. The question is, which will President Bush emphasize in his acceptance speech on Thursday night? Which will he emphasize in his campaign oratory and in his television commercials? And which, if either, will work? 
 It is hard to say. Mr. Bush is a political version of the 19th-century Yankee merchant, always genteel and mannerly in private but sometimes cunning and ruthless in business. He has said he will do whatever he needs to win re-election, and he commented when he arrived here, "I have always done better when I fight back."
 
Strategy of Divisiveness
 He has also employed, this year as four years ago, accomplished political rabbit punchers who think divisiveness often wins elections.
Patrick J. Buchanan, Mr. Bush's erstwhile primary opponent, epitomized the scowling face of conservatism on the convention's first day. We are America, he said in effect, and the rest of you are not. But former President Ronald Reagan, eloquent still at 81 years of age, urged his fellow Republicans to keep their eyes fixed on his metaphorical "shining city on the hill."
Today Mr. Bond conceded that "George Bush and Pat Buchanan have some differences of opinion on a lot of subjects," but he also said, "Pat Buchanan's speech was brilliant, and I think that he is now on Bill Clinton's tail." James Lake, another top Republican manager, argued that Mr. Buchanan's denunciations of homosexuals, feminists and liberals in general would give needed help to the ticket in Orange County, Calif., a Republican bastion that in years past would have long since been locked up by the party.
 
'Not Comfortable With That'
 But many in the party, equally conservative, made no secret of their displeasure at the tenor of Mr. Buchanan's speech and others like it, including one by Attorney General Dan Lungren of California this morning in which he revived the Willie Horton theme that the Republicans used against Michael S. Dukakis in 1988.
Asked how Mr. Buchanan's pitch would play in Wisconsin this fall, the state's Governor, Tommy G. Thompson, replied, "I don't think it will," grimaced and walked away.
Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, the most influential Republican spokesman on foreign policy on Capitol Hill, was more explicit.
"Pat's message is not a very appealing one for most Americans, and it's not a winning message," he said at a breakfast meeting with reporters. "You don't build majorities by excluding whole groups of people, and you don't have to be nasty to be conservative. I wish they'd cut it out, especially the attacks on Hillary. I'm not comfortable with that at all."
Mr. Lugar said he hoped the President and most Republican candidates would "try to make the Republican message more inclusive." Nothing would really matter, he said, unless the President offered the convention "a set of ideas that adds up to some potential for real economic change for average people, and not just broad principles and more attacks on Congress."
But the Republicans, even the conservatives, are deeply split between two approaches, each favored by one of the contenders for the party's Presidential nomination in 1996. They both spoke tonight. Housing Secretary Jack F. Kemp favors tax cuts to stimulate the economy, an idea that Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, who wants to balance the budget before anything else, calls "free-lunch politics."
In his speech tonight, Mr. Kemp did no lobbying for reduced taxes, but he eagerly identified himself with the Reagan approach. He said his party's purpose was "not to denounce the past, but to inspire our nation to a better future." Mr. Gramm did the same, bashing the Democrats' policies but avoiding divisive language, and pledging that "America's third century will be our greatest century."
The Republicans sent to the platform this morning and tonight a racially and ideologically diverse series of speakers, including a dozen women, with advocates and opponents of abortion rights among them.
They called the Democrats the party of April 15 and themselves the party of July 4. They described affirmative action for minorities as a snare and a delusion. Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the minority leader, mocked Mr. Clinton as an advocate of "taxation without hesitation."
 
Verbal Flame Throwing
 Most drew back from Buchanan-style demonization. The former White House speech writer had slashed away at Governor Clinton, picturing him as a "draft-dodger" who lacked "the moral authority to call on Americans to put their lives at risk." He had described Hillary Clinton as the standard-bearer of "radical feminism" and arch-enemy of the family.
After a daylong uproar over Mr. Buchanan's tactics, Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia was one of the few who leapt into the fray at his side. Mr. Gingrich accused the Democrats of promoting "a multicultural, nihilistic hedonism that is inherently destructive of a healthy society."
On the floor, delegates held up small signs that asked, "If Hillary can't trust him, how can we?" in an allusion to the charges about the private life of the Democratic nominee. A big banner also went up picturing a marijuana leaf with the caption, "Bill Clinton's Smoking Gun."
This is a frustrated convention, unable quite to comprehend what has gone wrong after 12 years of soaring electoral success, unsure exactly what to do about it. Frustration breeds bitterness, and much of that has spilled out in attacks on Democrats, the Clintons and reporters and commentators.
Mr. Reagan was never one for bitterness or meanness of spirit, even in the heat of combat, and his sunny, optimistic spirit shone through his speech. He was partisan enough, heaping scorn on the Democrats on Capitol Hill: "the gavel-wielding chairmen, the bloated staffs, the taxers and takers and Congressional rule makers." But he emphasized his own accomplishments and George Bush's abilities, not any personal failings of Mr. and Mrs. Clinton.
 
Including the Outsiders
 The former President chose the rhetoric of inclusion, reminding delegates that "we are all equal in the eyes of God -- whether we come from poverty or wealth, whether we are Afro-American or Irish-American, Christian or Jewish, from big cities or small towns."
Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., who served as political director in the Reagan White House, liked what his old boss had to say. Mr. Reagan, he said, "has saved conservatives from the perils of negativisim before, and maybe he can get us on the right course again with the positive tone of his speech."
Later in the day, it was announced that Mr. Daniels would be joining the Bush campaign team.

HEADLINE: Housing Starts Fell 2.8% in July

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 18

 BODY:
Despite the lowest mortgage rates since the early 1970's, the pace at which builders broke ground for new homes slumped 2.8 percent in July, the second straight decline, the Commerce Department reported today.
The somewhat unexpected skid, combined with downward revisions for both May and June, meant housing was not only no longer pacing the lackluster recovery, as it had until spring, but was becoming a drag. 
 It was also another negative dose of economic news for the Bush Administration during this week of the Republican National Convention.
 
Competing Factors

 
 "We've got a tug-of-war going between lower interest rates and the factors causing the lower interest rates," said David Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders. The weak economy and poor consumer confidence, he indicated, seemed to be prevailing.
Mr. Seiders fretted that not even tumbling rates on adjustable mortgages, which are now available at rates just over 5 percent, were providing the stimulus he had expected.
Conventional 30-year mortgages have also become more attractive, averaging 7.96 percent compared with 9.03 percent as recently as March. This is the first time 30-year rates have moved below 8 percent in almost 20 years.
Permits for home construction did rise 3.7 percent last month, today's report also showed, but analysts found little solace in this. Contrary to widespread belief, the permits figure has not proved a reliable indicator of future activity, and in any event the July increase for single-family homes was negligible.
 
An Economist's View
 "It's a little disappoining," commented David W. Berson, economist for the Federal National Mortgage Association, the Government-chartered company that buys home loans. "Builders are not responding fully to lower rates and a pickup in sales."
The department reported in late July that sales of new single-family homes in June were at an annual rate of 572,000, up 7.9 percent from May.
July's starts, at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, were 1.12 million, down from revised rates of 1.15 million in June and 1.20 million in May. The June decline was revised to 3.8 percent, instead of the 3.2 percent first reported.
This was the first time since January 1991 that housing starts, which have a significant ripple effect throughout the economy, have dropped for two straight months.
"The recovery in housing starts, even with falling interest rates, may be running out of gas," the United States Chamber of Commerce said.
Last month's decline in starts, which was experienced in all regions but the South, was entirely accounted for by a drop in single-family homes, to a rate of 959,000 from an even 1 million. Construction of multi-unit buildings rose a bit, as an increase of 14,000 for those with five units or more countered a decline of 5,000 for buildings with two to four units.
The overall decline was most severe in the West, where starts fell 7.7 percent, to a pace of 275,000, and in the Northeast, where the decline was 5.5 percent, to 120,000. Starts in the Midwest eased 1.5 percent, to an annual rate of 267,000.
The South's increase, to a pace of 457,000 from 455,000, amounted to four-tenths of 1 percent.
Without seasonal adjustment, the actual number of starts last month was 110,500, compared with 118,400 in June and 115,200 in May.

HEADLINE: REPUBLICANS IN HOUSTON: The Houston Thing;
Paging Any Blacks. Report to the Stage.

BYLINE: By Maureen Dowd and Frank Rich, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Aug. 18

 BODY:
This was diversity night at the Republican National Convention, with a eclectic parade that included a rabbi, a governor who advocates abortion rights, the former pro quarterback Roger Staubach and the only black in the Bush cabinet, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Louis W. Sullivan.
Despite efforts to broaden the "big tent," it has not stretched over many blacks. Convention planners had to reach back to two long-gone Bush Administration officials to balance the convention show. 
 Fred McClure, the most prominent black official in the very White House until he left to become a Dallas banker, sang the national anthem at the opening convention session Monday morning. It was his most visible moment with the President since he sang "The Battle Hymn of the Republic" a cappella at a fund-raiser for Senator Phil Gramm in the Astrodome in 1990. Condoleezza Rice, a National Security staff member who left two years ago, came from Stanford University to praise Mr. Bush's foreign policy.
Meanwhile, black delegates are in such short supply that two of the television networks had to use the same faces when searching for black audience reactions to the references to the Los Angeles riots in Ronald Reagan's speech Monday night.
In the Department of Symbolism, delegates have been fending off queries all week about a shindig on the final night at the River Oaks Country Club, one of the three clubs that the 1988 Democratic Vice-Presidential candidate, Senator Lloyd Bentsen, fleetingly resigned four years ago because of its all-white membership.
 
No Comment Yet On Strategy for '94
 The Vice President promised today that there would be "a new Dan Quayle in 1992." But it looked a lot like the old Dan Quayle from here.
Asked by Bernard Shaw of CNN if a Bush-Quayle victory this year would make him the heir apparent in 1996, the Vice President answered:
"Let us get through this week. Let us get through the debate or debates. Let us see George Bush re-elected this November. And then we'll talk about 1994."
Perhaps Jack F. Kemp, James A. Baker 3d, William J. Bennett and Patrick J. Buchanan won't be running that year.
 
Southern Belles For Safer Sex
 Lovely to look at, somewhat surreal to behold, in hoop-skirted gowns of violet, pink, blue and teal, a bevy of self-described Southern belles visited the Republican convention at mid-day, to dispense Texas hospitality and condoms.
Sashaying rather self-consciously into the Astrodome complex, the Southern Belles for Safer Sex were met with a surprisingly warm reception as they handed out the green and red prophylactics from dainty wicker baskets.
"Hi there, honey, would you like a condom?" said Tina Hester, chief belle, to the police officer at the front gate.
"Why, thank you ma'am," he said, taking two.
"Nobody is rude to a belle," Ms. Hester said with satisfaction.
The belles are members of such groups as the National Organization for Women and Planned Parenthood staging a light protest against the Republican platform's position on abortion.
Political conventioneers are so frequently accosted by pamphleteers that they tend to take what is handed to them without breaking stride. That, at least, was Michael K. Deaver's excuse.
The former Reagan White House chief of staff, who took two condoms from a belle in blue, said, when asked if he was pleased at the little bonus the day had brought, "What? What? I thought they were handing out cookies or mints." But, as he walked on, he kept the gift.
"My daughter will love this," he said, laughing.
 
Woody Allen And Family Values
 The New York tabloid headlines about Woody Allen began to provoke the family-values police among the Republican delegates today. The reviews have been somewhat less kind than those that greeted Mr. Allen's less-than-rapturously received last film, "Shadows and Fog."
"That's wacko Hollywood," said Robert K. Dornan, a California Congressman interviewed by CNN on the convention floor. "I'm a big fan. Woody, why did you do this to us?"
 
Rocking the Astrodome
 At a convention whose show business contingent is top-heavy with country music singers and faded Hollywood icons like Pat Boone and Charlton Heston, rock-and-roll, if not necessarily youth, still must be served.
Three Dog Night, a rock group best known for its 1970 hit "Mama Told Me Not to Come," gave a concert to a small but vocal crowd in the American Spirit Pavilion.
"They're making a comeback," said Torie Clarke, the Bush campaign spokeswoman. "It's retro-chic."
One rock critic has described "Mama Told Me" as a paean to "getting drunk at a party" and a "celebration of hedonism and substance abuse."
In "Wouldn't It Be Nice," his 1991 autobiography, the Beach Boys' Brian Wilson described the "ample supply of stimulants" he surveyed at the Hollywood Hills home of Danny Hutton, then and now a Three Dog Night lead singer, in the early 1970's.
Presumably the group now abides by the Republican Party Platform, which declares, "Dope is no longer trendy."
 
The Recession Hits Home
 A large sign above the Houston Shoe Hospital, at a shopping center not far from the wealthy River Oaks neighborhood, reveals the politics of pain, Republican style:
"Topsiders Resoled Here."
 
Tall and Bronze, It's the President
 At a time when the statues of Lenin and Stalin are toppling to history and Washington is still debating over a likeness of Franklin D. Roosevelt, leave it to the Texans to come up with a prime example of grandiose political art.
Within yards of a chunk of the Berlin Wall in the Astrodome Arena stands an eight-foot-tall bronze statue of the President, as cast by David Adickes, a Houston artist.
A rather young Mr. Bush, of an intedeterminate age somewhere between World War II aviator and United Nations Ambassador, seems to be caught in winds as powerful as those that swept Dorothy and Toto to Oz. Mr. Bush strides into the gale, chin up, shirtsleeves rolled up, tie whipping off his left shoulder, jacket streaming horizontally back from the right. In his left hand, he clutches a book.
The title, as if scripted by the convention's theme engineers: "The Winds of Change."
 
The Calendar Is Ticking
 The Liberal/Media Lynch Mob Department:
"I don't mind the four more years," Murray Kempton of Newsday said today. "It's the three more days that is more than I can stand."

HEADLINE: Why Haven't More Banks Failed?

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Earlier this year, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation warned that 200 banks with combined assets of more than $80 billion would fail this year. After seven months, however, only 70 banks with $20.9 billion of assets have failed, far below the rate the F.D.I.C. forecast.
But even as banking experts debate how much the slowdown stems from election-year politics and how much from the palliative effects of the lower interest rates that make even the weakest banks more profitable, the F.D.I.C. is warning that tougher new regulations that will take effect on Dec. 19 will result in a flurry of bank closings. 
 After Dec. 19, regulators must either start closing banks whose shareholder capital drops below 2 percent of assets, or provide good reasons why they are letting them stay open. A good reason, F.D.I.C. officials say, would be a viable plan for a quick merger or infusion of fresh capital.
Under current law, state and Federal regulators do not usually close banks unless they are insolvent, meaning that the value of the bank's assets, like loans and securities, is not equal to the combined total of its capital and what it owes depositors.
"The idea is to close institutions while there is at least some theoretical value left," said Robert F. Mialivich, assistant director for bank supervision at the F.D.I.C. "If you wait until the bank has zero capital, it has long been proved that it has a negative value as soon as it is closed."
The 2 percent rule, which was part of the banking legislation passed late last year, is intended to reduce the F.D.I.C.'s losses from failed banks.
William Taylor, chairman of the F.D.I.C., estimates that based on the agency's latest information a number of banks with assets of $30 billion to $45 billion will be affected by the rule changes, though he will not disclose how many.
Ferguson & Company, an Irving, Tex., consulting firm, found that 54 banks with $17.3 billion of assets failed to meet the 2 percent test, based on public reports filed by banks on March 31.
Notwithstanding the predictions for many more closings at the end of this year -- or maybe in part because of the predictions -- accusations that regulators are playing politics with bank failures remain widespread.
Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, the Texas Democrat who is chairman of the House Banking Committee, is among those who suggest that banking regulators may be delaying the closing of weak banks to avoid controversy in advance of the November elections. Mr. Gonzalez said in June that the slow pace of bank closings was reminiscent of the way savings and loans were handled in 1988.
Accusations continue that regulators have been too slow to close financially shaky savings institutions. Because the Resolution Trust Corporation, the Federal agency that handles failed savings and loans, has lacked the money it needs to handle large failures, some institutions have remained open longer than analysts expected.
The F.D.I.C., for its part, received an extra $30 billion from the Treasury last year for dealing with troubled banks, but it has not yet used any of that money.
Some bankers noted that a policy of early intervention, where banks are closed before they are insolvent, might not always be the least costly way for Federal regulators to handle weak banks.
"It makes a lot of sense when property values and overall conditions are deteriorating," said Charles D. Jeffrey, president of the Heritage Bank for Savings, a Holyoke, Mass., bank that has a plan for raising more capital, but is now below the 2 percent level. "But at times like now, when real estate markets have stabilized and banks are benefiting from lower interest rates, it is exactly the wrong thing to do, as far as the Federal taxpayer is concerned."
When conditions are favorable, Mr. Jeffrey said, the weakly capitalized banks might find fresh capital and survive, at no cost to the F.D.I.C. But if they are closed, he said, there is still a chance the F.D.I.C. will lose money.
Some banking experts stop short of accusing regulators of bending the rules to avoid closing banks. But they say regulators are more inclined to sit on their hands before an election.
"Neither party would seem to benefit from bank closings, and I think the regulators have recognized that," said Edward Furash, a Washington bank consultant.
Fred Finke, a deputy in the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency who is in charge of supervising the weakest national banks, acknowledged that "closings have been running a little slower than we expected." But, he added, there simply have not been as many insolvent banks as had been expected. "We are not doing anything designed to push the failures back beyond November," he said.
Mr. Taylor says it is economic factors, not politics, that have kept more weak banks alive.
"The biggest thing to slow down the pace of failures has been the decline in interest rates," Mr. Taylor said. "It has had the effect of helping some banks improve their condition in a material way, while for others it has just postponed the inevitable."
 
Fresh Inflows of Capital
 Besides the benefits of lower interest rates, Mr. Finke notes that many troubled banks have already set aside reserves for bad loans or written off the loans at a loss. And banks are not facing the same steady decline in the value of their loans as they were the past few years, he said.
Another cause of the slower-than-expected failure rate, Mr. Finke said, is that "there are more people out there who are thinking that maybe it is still possible to earn a return in banking." Just as large banks have rushed to offer stock this year, he noted, smaller banks have also found it easier to restore their financial condition by issuing more stock, in small, private transactions.
Mr. Finke said the fresh inflow of money to banking was not dramatic enough to eliminate the industry's problems, but "it could make the difference beween having 16 failures so far this year, or having 20 or 25."
Some bankers are still scrambling to increase their capital. The First City Bancorporation of Texas, a holding company in Houston that has four banks below the 2 percent capitalization level, last week announced a plan to sell small banks and raise $100 million from its shareholders and new investors. The plan, if successful, would put the company on solid financial footing.
 
Facing Up to the Problems
 Even if the F.D.I.C. or state regulators were acting cautiously because of the election, there is not much to suggest that they are denying the existence of problems -- as savings and loan regulators were doing in 1988.
Mr. Taylor, who came to the F.D.I.C. last October and whose term expires in March 1993, describes himself as a bureaucrat whose career at the Federal Reserve did not prepare him for bending to prevailing political winds.
Earlier this year, in fact, Mr. Taylor voted in favor of a sharp increase in the deposit insurance premiums banks must pay -- a sign that he was not trying to minimize the industry's problems.
Before that, Mr. Taylor pushed the F.D.I.C. to revise downward its forecasts for its own financial condition. Instead of accounting only for losses it would suffer at banks that are on the verge of failure, the agency now casts its net wider to include losses from banks that it estimates are likely to fail, even though the event is not imminent.
"I operated on the simple principle that the loses are there whether the bank gets closed today or sometime in the future," he explained.
In another indication that the F.D.I.C. is not trying to hide industry problems, early this year the agency sharply increased the amount of assets on its list of troubled banks.
Those banks, whose problems with low capital, bad loans, weak management and poor earnings are severe enough to be rated four or five on a scale in which the bottom is five, had assets of $610 billion at the end of 1991, up sharply from $487 billion three months earlier. Since the number of banks on the problem list increased only slightly -- to 1,016 from 1,005 -- analysts said the sharp increase in assets apparently reflected a decision, made since Mr. Taylor's arrival, to include one or more very large banks.
Mr. Taylor has so far withstood the temptation to issue a more rosy forecast for the industry. He noted that the benefits of lower interest rates would not last forever and that "when interest rates rise, as they surely will some day, it is going to kick out some banks" onto the list of those that regulators will close.
"Some people inside here are of the opinion that things are better," he said, "but I am not convinced yet."

Table: "Banks On the Edge"
 
Here is a list of banks in the United States that would have failed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's new capital adequacy test if it had been applied on March 31, 1992, the latest date for which figtures are available. The new test will take effect Dec. 19.
 
The test requires that banks have Tier 1 capital - roughly the same as shareholders' equity - equal to 2 percent or more of the bank's total assets, a measurement known as the bank's leverage ratio. If the ratio falls below 2 percent, regulators must close the bank.
 
Banks with negative Tier 1 capital are listed as insolvent. Banks closed since March 31 are excluded. Within each group, banks are ranked by total assets. The figures were provided by Ferguson & Company, a consulting firm, based on banks' reports filed with the F.D.I.C.
 
Total assets: As of March 31, in millions of dollars.
 
Leverage ratio: Ratio of Tier 1 capital to assets, in percent.
 
Large time deposits: Total value of time deposits of over $100,000 each, as of March 31, in millions of dollars.

HEADLINE: Twins Study Shows School Is Sound Investment

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
Like cleaner air and safer streets, better education has become a must on every politician's wish list. But in an era of shallow pockets, when an extra dollar for schools may mean a dollar less to keep the bridges from falling down, would more spending really pay off?
Just-completed research by two Princeton econometricians confirms that it probably would -- and handsomely. More years in school, Orley Ashenfelter and Alan Kreuger conclude, may well be the key to salvaging the declining prospects of unskilled workers. 
 The new study -- unusual in that it compared data from identical twins to distinguish the impact of nature from that of nurture -- estimates that, on average, each year of education at any stage, from grade school through graduate school, adds 16 percent to an individual's lifetime earnings.
"No ordinary investment is likely to produce anything close to this return," points out John Bishop, an economist at Cornell University.
The Princeton researchers' findings could prove manna from the ivory tower for Democratic Presidential candidate Bill Clinton, who has anchored his economic program to a big Federal investment in education. "This only strengthens my conviction that Americans' standard of living is uniquely connected to skills and training," said Robert Reich, a Harvard Business School professor and a leading economic strategist for the Clinton campaign.
While earlier studies on the relationship between schooling and income have used survey data collected for other purposes, the Princeton researchers decided to start fresh with what they call a "natural experiment." They interviewed 298 people over the age of 18 who were identical twins, triplets or, in one case, quadruplets, and who were attending the Twins Day Festival in Twinsburg, Ohio, last summer.
Each twin answered a series of questions on his or her years of education as well as marital status, race, military service, parents' income, work experience, profession and union membership -- in short, anything that might have affected current earnings.
 
Cleansing Research Bias
 The same information could have been gathered with less fuss from unrelated individuals. But studying twins, Mr. Kreuger said, was uniquely useful in neutralizing suspected sources of bias that have dogged previous statistical studies.
Analysts have long worried that school attendance was closely correlated with unmeasured factors, like intelligence and social class, that were influential in determining a person's earning power later in life. Thus, estimates excluding these unmeasured factors might leave the impression that schooling was a better investment than it really was. But by looking at the differences in earnings and education between genetically identical twins who grew up together, the researchers believe this "selection bias" has largely been cleansed from the estimates.
While interviewing twins could not completely eliminate misreporting by interviewees, the researchers corrected for that potential bias by asking each twin to report on the education of the other.
This cleverly constructed experiment has yielded what many analysts regard as the most trustworthy estimate of the current return on an investment in education -- and what all regard as the most striking. If an extra year of high school or college education adds 16 percent to the average individuals' wage, a four-year college degree can be expected to increased an individual's earnings by almost two-thirds.
 
Words of Warning
 Paul Taubman, an economist at the University of Pennsylvania, cautions that the reported earnings gain attributable to schooling -- roughly twice that found in his own study of World War II veterans during the 1970's -- may be misleading. While he acknowledges that the age, education and earnings of the twins were close to national averages, Mr. Taubman worries that "there may be subtler differences" that make the sample unrepresentative of Americans in general.
Arthur Goldberger, an economist at the University of Wisconsin, focuses on another possible problem in interpreting the research. The difference in schooling between twins was the result of family choices, he notes. Thus, the Princeton results may not accurately predict the consequences of such government-mandated changes in school attendance as lengthening the school year or increasing the minimum dropout age.
It is also conceivable that the remarkably high average return on education is a transitory phenomenon, although Mr. Bishop, the Cornell economist, finds that improbable. His own research suggests that the demand for skilled workers will grow in the 1990's, not shrink. But even if the estimated 16 percent return is on the high side, many economists view the results as a potent mandate for investing in education.
Isabel Sawhill of the Urban Institute in Washington notes that the increasingly open world economy is forcing unskilled American workers to compete with their counterparts everywhere from China to Mexico, widening the income gap between America's haves and have-nots and feeding a protectionist backlash.
But the potential for hefty earnings-gains from education, she argues, implies that America need not choose between a stagnant closed economy that protects blue-collar workers and an open one that grows at the expense of the least fortunate. If virtually all Americans could acquire skills, a great majority would be likely to prosper in the global market.
 
Tuition as Tax Surcharge
 Mr. Bishop warns, however, that raising average skill levels might take a costly reorganization of the education system. He sees promise in "doing what the Germans do" (and what the Clinton campaign promises to do), tying the last years of high school for noncollege-track students to apprenticeship programs. But he is concerned that many students with college potential are being priced out of the game by rising tuition rates.
Representative Tom Petri, a Republican from Wisconsin who has led the effort in the House to restructure college loan programs, offers a more optimistic view. While he agrees that higher education is now out of the reach of many middle-income families, the double-digit return estimated by researchers suggests that "most students ought to be able to pay for college or technical training out of their future earnings."
His preferred solution would be to offer more generous Federal loans that students would repay as a percentage surcharge on their future income taxes. Those who chose low-paying occupations, or simply did not get much from the extra years spent hitting the books, would be helped along by the majority who used college as a ticket to affluence.
Mr. Ashenfelter agrees that the benefits from pooling the risks of investment in higher education offer "a classic justification for Government intervention." So, apparently, does Mr. Clinton, who has proposed college loans that could be repaid either through an income tax surcharge or through community service after graduation. Even the free-marketeers in the Bush Administration are willing to test the idea of income-contingent loans: the education bill just signed by the President includes a $500 million demonstration project.
No one is claiming that increased education is the magic bullet for curing what ails the American economy. But in Ms. Sawhill's view, the Ashenfelter-Kreuger research reveals what amounts to the next best thing. "It is the one investment", she said, "that would increase overall productivity and narrow the income gap that has been widening since the mid-1970's."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasuries Regain Some Ground

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The bond market rose modestly yesterday, wiping out most of Monday's losses on the 30-year bond and moving higher in other maturities. But traders and analysts are still worried about some sudden surprise from the Republican National Convention and expect the market to be volatile for the rest of the week.
The day's economic data continued to paint a picture of an economy growing slowly, which is one of the main reasons prices of notes and bonds have advanced recently. 
 The Commerce Department reported that housing starts fell 2.8 percent in July, which surprised many analysts inasmuch as home mortgage rates are close to 20-year lows. The consensus forecast was for an increase of 1.7 percent.
The one possibly positive note in the housing report was that permits for new structures were up 3.7 percent last month. But a lot of those new permits were for multifamily housing, not single-family dwellings, which would give a stronger lift to the economy. Permits for single-family homes have remained basically unchanged since April.
 
Slower Sales Seen
 The Johnson Redbook report, which covers sales for department and chain stores, predicted that sales this month would decline four-tenths of a percent from July if they continued at the pace of the first two weeks of August.
But investors were only moderately lifted by the news because of jitters about the Republican convention, though White House officials have tried to indicate there will not be any big economic policy pronouncements this week, even on Thursday night when President Bush is scheduled to give his acceptance speech.
"Most of the people are still focusing on what comes out of the Republican convention," said one government bond trader. He also said that the billions of dollars in notes and bonds sold in the big quarterly Treasury auction last week were still weighing down the market.
In late trading in the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 7.25 percent 30-year bond was offered at 991/16 , up 12/32 , to yield 7.32 percent, compared with 7.35 percent on Monday.
In other maturities, the 6.375 percent 10-year note was offered at 995/16 , up 7/16 , to yield 6.47 percent, down from 6.52 percent the day before. The 5.5 percent five-year note was offered at 100 3/8, up 3/8, to yield 5.41 percent, down from 5.49 percent on Monday.
The one-year bill was trading at a discount rate of 3.20 percent, down 4 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. The Treasury will auction $14.25 billion in new one-year bills tomorrow.
Another signal of the market's uncertainty was the widening of the differential between the yield on intermediate-term notes, like the two-year note, and longer-term securities, like the the 30-year bond.
Some investors are showing a preference for shorter-term maturities because they are less volatile. Therefore, if there is some unexpected news from the Republican convention, the prices of these securities are likely to fall less than those of the 30-year bonds.
The differential or spread between the two-year note and the 30-year bond widened on Monday by 6 basis points. And it widened again yesterday by 3 basis points.
The spread between the five-year note and the 30-year bond also increased, rising 9 basis points from Friday. Both these moves show that investors are moving from longer securities to those of shorter-terms.
Analysts said they they did not see signs of the Federal Reserve's moving to lower short-term interest rates at the meeting yesterday of its Open Market Committee. And the debate continues among economists who watch the Fed over whether the current economic data, including the housing starts figures released yesterday, will make the Fed act soon.

HEADLINE: Bank Funds And C.D.'s Fall Again

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
In what has become a painful weekly ritual for bank depositors, yields of bank money market accounts and those of certificates of deposit were down again in the latest period, which ended today.
According to data gathered by The Bank Rate Monitor, the greatest setback appeared to be in money market accounts, which reflect conditions in the short-term money market that find Treasury securities near historical lows. 
 The weaker the economic indicators, the greater the downward pressure on savings yields as the Government does what it can to bring along a recovery.
"Since July, when the Fed cut the discount rate and banks cut the prime, five-year certificates of deposits have dropped 50 basis points, with shorter maturities not far behind," said Robert K. Heady, publisher of The Monitor. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
"What may be happening now," Mr. Heady said, "is that banks may be giving themselves room between what they pay out to depositors and what they lend out, setting the stage for another cut in the prime for sometime in September, when the Fed is expected to ease again."
 
Treasury Barometer Falling
 At the Treasury's weekly three- and six-month bill auction on Monday, rates slipped for the second straight week. The auction is regarded by many interest-rate watchers as a fairly good barometer of what banks will be paying out to their depositors in coming weeks.
The average rate on a three-month Treasury bill at auction was 3.10 percent, down 3 basis points from the previous auction, while the six-month bill fell a basis point, to 3.18 percent.
In the latest week, New York area banks, including commercial and savings institutions, reduced the average yield on a money market account by 2 basis points, to 3.03 percent, while knocking down the yield on three- and six-month certificates by 3 basis points, to 3.04 percent and 3.25 percent.
In the data for the New York commercial banks alone, the cuts were only one basis point across the board, with a money market account slipping to 2.86 percent, a three-month certificate to 2.90 percent and a six-month certificate to 3.07 percent.
It was the New York-area savings banks that moved more aggressively, cutting money markets accounts by an average 2 basis points, to 3.20 percent. Three-month certificates were down 5 basis points, to 3.19 percent, and six-month certificates were down 6 basis points, to 3.44. That compared with an average decline of 3 basis points on six-month certificates among 20 major banks nationally.
In the New York area, the largest yield adjustments were at Midlantic Banks in New Jersey, which cut its money market account by 15 basis points, to 3.10 percent, and at First Fidelity of New Jersey, which lowered its three-month certificate by 30 basis points, to 3.40 percent -- only one week after raising it by the same amount. Chase Manhattan, on the other hand, raised the yield of its six-month certificate by 25 basis points, to 2.94 percent.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN;
A Market for Playing the 2 Candidates

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: IOWA CITY, Aug. 18

 BODY:
All the daily claptrap of the American Presidential contest -- slogan and sleaze, spouses' spin and poll takers' posturing -- are mercifully left behind each morning when Forrest Nelson turns on the computer monitor of the Iowa Political Stock Market to watch the overnight investments of a silent minority who are putting their money where the politicians' mouths are.
There are 550 investors and $34,000 in the market this week, and the beauty of its calm traffic in buying and selling Bush and Clinton securities is that the automated investment process pares away the hustings' blather factor. 
 This morning, the Gateway 2000 computer hummed with price changes from America's lucrative soul, not the latest hyperbole bites from the Republican conventioneers in Houston. The screen's message, while multi-hued as any rally bunting, was humble: Read my blips.
"Pat Buchanan's speech didn't inspire a dollar to move," said Mr. Nelson, an economist here at the University of Iowa. He and three other economic and political faculty members invented the political stock market in 1988 and eventually saw its investors predict the results to within one-tenth of a percentage point of the actual vote -- a precision they say was six times better than the closest final opinion polls that year.
 
Pros Are Sitting Tight
 This morning, there was none of the folderol over convention "bounce" to be read into the overnight numbers because the market investors are not going to get any more excited about the Republicans' gathering in Houston than they did about the Democrats in New York last month, when President Bush, in the Iowa market, experienced none of the poll takers' 17-point boon for Bill Clinton.
As the rest of the nation is hearing melodramatic assessments of an incumbent President having to come from behind, the Iowa market shows Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton neck and neck, with the Arkansas Governor having taken a half-cent edge, or half percentage popularity point, last week.
Aficionados are trading in an all-night, seven-day market in which investments are made from cash advances and in which, incidentally, family values have no discernible value. Last month, while most political junkies were wringing or washing their hands over Ross Perot's sudden departure from the race, investors were at their computers bailing out so that Mr. Perot's price, which translates to a percentage share of popular support, dropped from 30 cents a share to half a cent in a matter of minutes.
"I did all right," said Boaz Weinstein, a high-yield specialist with a major Wall Street investment bank who has $1,000 in two accounts in the political market and plays it for a mixture of fun and his professional need to be attuned daily to politics. "I caught a CNN bulletin and got into the market about 20 seconds before Perot stock started falling off a cliff."
 
Many With Minimum Stake
 Most investors are students down toward the $5 minimum end of the investor's stake. But they are no less enthusiastic than Mr. Weinstein at their hard-money lessons, which, even at penny-ante stakes, provide markets for payoffs on the precise party sharing of the Presidential popular vote as well as on such exotic put-and-call subtleties as how far above or below half the vote total a candidate will finish.
Typically, investors buy into the market with five "unit portfolios," at a cost of $1 each, representing equal shares in Bush and Clinton stock. They are then free to buy and sell these and more endlessly. The payoff after the election will be $1 a share times the percentage of popular vote each candidate registers. This morning the market was at 50.2 cents for a Clinton share and 48.6 cents for a Bush share, with Perot investors holding die-hard paper.
"We try not to refer to this as the point-spread market," Mr. Nelson said, playing down the sort of gambling attraction that led some of the university's law professors to object on ethical grounds. He dismisses the notion that if the market ever gets too big and too active it could become just the sort of family-value issue that politicians prefer for their dire warning portfolio.
Mr. Nelson figures an active and sagacious high-roller who has $500 in the market might double his money. Mr. Weinstein hopes he might realize a 30-percent return on his $1,000 if he plays the market well. This involves sound investments on both the best and the worst President Bush can do in the vote (no better than 54 percent, no worse than 46), and churning his money wisely in response to what he considers serious political developments.
 
Insulated From Bombast
 Here in the pit, far from the madding conventions, it is possible to savor the sheer coldheartedness of the market on the American political scene, and its relative insulation from the ephemeral bombast of the great beyond.
Last winter, at the beginning of the Democrats' primary and caucus fights, Iowa's favorite son candidate, Senator Tom Harkin, came to the campus here to speak. "His stock was falling in our primary market before he got here and it kept falling while he was speaking," recalled Mr. Nelson.
The primary market is closed and the market itself will close at 3 A.M. Election Day. The market is nonprofit, with no commissions or advertising allowed, so it operates at a loss of $2,000 a month, a teaching investment absorbed thus far by the university and a National Science Foundation grant. This year the market was federally sanctioned by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission as one of the oddest teaching experiments in the country.
In the Iowa market there is more risk about holding a political opinion, but also more wit. A new punter logging on for the first time can practice on a dummy market based on the 1948 Presidential race -- the "Dewey Wins" race in which President Harry S. Truman confounded all human markets.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Reporter's Notebook;
Scrambling For Time On the Air

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Aug. 18

 BODY:
Watching a Presidential campaign scramble for television air time is not a pretty picture. Gov. Bill Clinton's organization has resorted to all manner of genteel desperation to balance all the pretty red-white-and-blue pictures emanating from Houston.
Today's theme was discovery. 
 Mr. Clinton, arriving at the Statehouse to work at being a Governor for a few hours, complained that the Republicans seemed too preoccupied with the past instead of the future.
"You talk about slick," he said. "These guys have talked about how prudent they were, and they have presided over the 10 biggest deficits in American history, Reagan and Bush."
"They've brought us to the position we're in, and now they're asking for a fourth term," Mr. Clinton said, lumping Mr. Reagan's eight-year tenure with Mr. Bush's four-year one. "That's really the message of that speech last night. We want four terms. Three's not enough. And now we will discover America in our fourth term; sort of a Columbus theory of politics."
George Stephanopoulos, the campaign's communications director, who has dispensed daily dollops of campaign spin, declared: "The economy is dead in the water, and all they can do is attack Bill Clinton and attack his wife and kowtow to the far right.
"I mean, Pat Buchanan is 'Cape Fear' and Ronald Reagan is 'The Way We Were.' "
It's only a movie.
 
Hide-and-Seek Candidate

For a man who wants to be President, Bill Clinton has developed a genuine distaste for some of the universally public aspects of the job.
Last week, he dodged reporters at his hotel in Santa Monica, Calif., by taking out his Secret Service entourage for a morning run 20 minutes earlier than scheduled.
And today in Little Rock, he completely fooled the waiting camera crew, which was positioned for the daily jogging picture at the front gate of the Governor's Mansion.
For several moments frustrated network producers thought Mr. Clinton had been smuggled out of the mansion in the back seat of a sedan that had driven out virtually unnoticed. But it turned out that he had devised a more ingenious solution. He simply ran out the back way.
 
The Accent Thickens
 When Mr. Clinton travels South, it is not unusual for him to abandon his urbane ways long enough to become plain old Neighbor Bill, the Governor of Arkansas. His accent thickens, he uses the word "we" a lot and he speaks in an almost confidential tone about the problems the South has overcome. Race. Jobs. Politics.
"The other side is going to go down there to Houston, and they're going to say that Al Gore and I may have been born in Arkansas and Tennessee, but we're just a bunch of crazy wild-eyed liberals," Mr. Clinton predicted last week at a meeting of Southern state legislators.
By "we" he meant the Democratic ticket. But for his audience, which chuckled appreciatively, the pronoun crossed party lines, making all Southerners victim of the Republican slurs he described.
"They're going to say they took us to New York City in a safe and no one saw us in an incubator there for 20 years," Mr. Clinton said with folksy disdain. "And we've got crazy ideas and came home and hid them for 20 years, waiting for the opportunity to spring them on the rest of the country.
"They're going to say every speech I gave on the Fourth of July in northeast Arkansas was a deliberate attempt to conceal my radical impulses. And that we just can't wait to get into power in Washington so we can take your guns away and trample family values and raise taxes on every poor working person in America."

HEADLINE: On the Front Lines of the War Against Misery

BYLINE: By MARIA NEWMAN

 BODY:
Robert Brice arrived promptly for his appointment at the St. Nicholas Income Maintenance Center on West 125th Street the other morning, joining dozens of others waiting to tell their tales of hardship to a welfare worker. But before his turn came, Mr. Brice fell asleep, only to wake up two hours later to the sound of his name echoing across the huge expanse of the third-floor room.
He gathered up his envelopes stuffed with documentation of the hard times that have befallen him and wearily made his way to the desk of Terry Cowell, a welfare worker who has been seeing a lot of Robert Brices these days. 
 Last month, the number of New Yorkers on welfare broke the one million mark for the first time since the city's fiscal crisis in the 1970's, a vivid statistical measure of the recession's human toll.
Almost one in seven New Yorkers is on welfare: 1,005,210 in July, a 22 percent increase since January 1990.
 
Views of Misery
 To spend a day with a worker at any of the city's 39 welfare offices is to glimpse the hues and details of the recession's misery through the eyes of those who bear the weight of so many lives on the edge.
As an eligibility specialist, Ms. Cowell reviews applications for public-assistance benefits. In the three years she has had the job, she said, the stories of hardship have become increasingly more desperate.
"Some people come in and try to tell a little fib, but you can basically tell," she said, as she filled out paperwork on her overflowing desk. "The majority of people who come in here do need it. Many more of the people coming in these days have lost their jobs. Their unemployment benefits have run out. It's not that these people who come in here don't want to work. They want to work. They just can't find anything right now. And it seems to be getting worse."
The St. Nicholas Income Maintenance Center is currently handling 11,000 welfare cases, a load that is higher than anyone can remember, said Kathryn Harper, the center's director.
Here, in this narrow four-floor office building, tucked between shoe stores and hair salons on a busy Harlem intersection where street vendors crowd the sidewalk, every weekday 60 to 75 people apply for welfare benefits or renew their applications.
 
Urgent Stories
 But the third-floor reception area, where applicants pass through the welfare processing area, is quiet and orderly, underlining the contrast between the bureaucratic strictures of the welfare system and the urgency and privacy of the stories the workers must hear.
One day recently, a radio that was on in the reception area muffled the conversations of welfare workers interviewing clients at desks only a few feet apart. Rick Nelson crooned about going to a garden party as workers asked applicants: Do you have a bank account? Do you know where your children's father is? Are you able to work? Why are you applying for public assistance?
An irate applicant at one desk was shouting for all to hear, "What do you want me to do, rob a bank? Can't you see I'm in need?" A worker quietly responded, and no one else seemed to notice.
The room is marked by an air of quiet desperation, as the waiting people clutch worn envelopes and hold tight to the stories of hardship they will tell in due time. For some, the waiting is harder than for others.
"I guess maybe it was anxiety," Mr. Brice said quietly about his nap in the reception area. "It's hard for everybody. When I woke up, I thought maybe I'd missed my turn."
Mr. Brice, who is 56 years old, has sought but has been unable to find steady work since 1987, when he was laid off from his job as a maintenance worker in a Federal building downtown.
A self-described shy man, he has been surviving on odd jobs like washing cars or cleaning windows, "nothing to brag about," he said, and with the occasional meal from his sister and her family. But now, the rent is overdue and his resources have run dry.
Stories like Mr. Brice's abound. But, first, the applicants must make their way through a bureaucratic labyrinth. When they enter the room, they approach teller-like windows, where they are handed four-page application forms and given a number to mark their turn to talk with a worker, who explains the form and what documentation they will need to support their requests for benefits. They are given appointments to return with the completed forms and necessary documentation, like rent receipts and wage stubs.
When they return for a second visit, they wait their turn to talk with eligibility specialists like Ms. Cowell, whose desks line one wall. Ms. Cowell and the others spend about an hour with each applicant, perhaps six in a day, reviewing their forms and documentation to determine the urgency of each case. Some people require immediate assistance, for example if their electrical power has been shut off for lack of payment, or if they have no money for baby formula. Others can wait until official notification of eligibility in a month or so.
Once a client is approved, he or she is assigned to another welfare worker, who becomes the client's contact with the massive system that will provide benefits of about $176 every two weeks for one person. Those employees, called undercare workers, must handle about 170 cases at once, 15 more than last year. They may get desperate telephone calls from any of them at any time.
On one wall, a worker has posted a photocopy of an article whose headline reads: "Burnout: Are You a Candidate?"
But Ms. Cowell, who is 28, said that in her three years at this office, she has not become discouraged or jaded.
"It's all in how you treat people," she said. "You might get a person who raises his voice, but I never get upset. I never raise my voice. You never get anywhere that way. Sometimes they get upset and start screaming things like, 'How come you're asking for that?' And you try to explain it to them so that they'll understand."
In the same rote style as a police officer reading an arrested person his rights, Ms. Cowell told each applicant: "I am asking you these questions to determine your eligibility. I am now going to make photocopies of your documents, and after a I return, you may ask me any questions that you have."

 When it was Gladys Rivera's turn, she opened several envelopes to place tattered birth certificates, rent receipts and other documents in front of Ms. Cowell. She was applying for public assistance, she said, because she had recently lost her job as a personal care aide and has two children to support.
"I did a double boo-boo," she said. "I called the elderly lady that I was caring for to tell her I couldn't come to work one day, but I didn't call my boss. And I did it twice."
"I had just recently lost my mother and I was under a lot of pressure," she said. "She had cancer and I was taking care of her."
Ms. Rivera, who is 33, said she was on public assistance once before, in 1987, and at that time was placed in one of the agency's several job-training programs. That was how she found a job as a personal care aide.
"Now I'll look for something else," she said. "Maybe something in clerical. I've been a cashier before."
Ms. Rivera didn't seem surprised that more than a million New Yorkers were on public assistance, more than at any time in 20 years.
"There are a lot of people out of work right now, and a lot of people who are homeless," she said. "But I think, why be homeless? Why be out of a job if you can work? Especially if you have children. I would prefer working, but if you need a little bit of help, you need it."
Some people have grown weary of looking for jobs that never seem to come. Roy McNair was also in to see Ms. Cowell on Friday. His 13 weeks of unemployment benefits recently ran out. He had worked in maintenance with the city's public housing for several months, but it was a seasonal job that lasted only through April.
"I've been out looking for jobs, but I can't find one," said Mr. McNair, 49. "There's no work. I'm looking for any kind of work. Makes no difference to me. Everyone says they don't have no jobs."
Robert Brice has been depending on help from his sister and her children.
"If it wasn't for my family, I don't think I would've made it," he said. "They've been very supportive. But they have families of their own. After a while you feel like excess baggage. They tell me to come by, and I say I will, but I don't."
Mr. Brice's troubles began when he was laid off in 1987, and has been unable to find another steady job. Mr. Brice suspects it is because of his age.
"I don't know what that has to do with it," said Mr. Brice, who wore jeans and a blue sweater covered with lint. "No one seems to want to take a chance on a 56-year-old. I don't know why they consider that old. I don't consider myself old. They don't say it, they just always tell you they'll let you know, and then you never hear from them."

HEADLINE: Student Credit Union Fails At University of Connecticut

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: STORRS, Conn., Aug. 18

 BODY:
The University of Connecticut's student-run credit union has been closed because of poor record-keeping, risky lending practices and a high level of loan delinquencies.
The nonprofit UConn Student Federal Credit Union, which gave extra interest to students who earned A's, was declared insolvent on Monday after it had to write off $68,000 in bad loans. It had written off only $1,000 in the previous 12 years. 
 The National Credit Union Administration forced the credit union, which has 2,000 members, into liquidation, saying a suitable manager to reorganize it could not be found.
"If somebody else wants to give it a shot they could," a university spokesman, Richard Veilleux, said today. "But the Federal people have been keeping an eye on this union since April when the delinquent and flat-out bad loans started mounting."
Regulators would not provide details on how insolvent the credit union was. Mr. Veilleux said the 13-year-old credit union has $1.1 million in assets.
 
'Just the Recession'
 "It's just the recession," Mr. Veilleux said. "All loans had to be cosigned, but the recession has been so long and so bad, not only are borrowers failing to repay, but cosigners aren't paying."
Anthony LaCreta, deputy regional director of the National Credit Union Administration, said all credit union members would get their money back and the checks would be sent in about two weeks.
The closure was prompted by long-term "mismanagement of operations" at the credit union, including the lack of documentation of loans and a lack of consistent procedures in making loans, Mr. LaCreta said.
Lewis Mandell, a professor of finance and political science, said many of his students learned the skills to be bankers by volunteering at the credit union. "It's a double loss to the university," he said.
An organization run by students that gave loans to other students was probably more vulnerable to the Northeast's recession than other credit unions, Professor Mandell said. Credit unions that are run by employers are usually more insulated from bad loans, he said.
"You hate to use the word inevitable," Professor Mandell said, "but it was almost inevitable that if you're giving loans to people who really need it, you're going to get hurt."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Posts Broad Declines; Gold Prices Are Also Down

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar drifted lower against most major currencies in thin trading yesterday as investors digested news on the United States economy and tensions in the Middle East. Gold prices also fell.
Dollar traders were somewhat discouraged by news that construction of single-family homes and apartments fell 2.8 percent in July, said Richard Mahoney, vice president of foreign exchange at Citibank. 
 "Housing starts were weaker than the market expected, which keeps interest rate expectations low and naturally the dollar suffers a little bit," Mr. Mahoney said.
Tensions between the United States and Iraq also caught traders' attention yesterday, lifting the German mark against most other currencies, Mr. Mahoney said.
Political unrest abroad tends to drive investors into currencies that are considered safe havens, such as the dollar and the mark. With traders uncertain about the United States economy and in turn the dollar, they were leaning toward the mark yesterday.
In New York, the dollarcurrency fell to 1.4570 marks, from 1.4640 late Monday. In earlier European trading, the dollar fell to 1.4580 German marks from 1.4625.
Government officials in Washington and Paris have threatened to enforce United Nations resolutions to ease the repression of Shiites in southern Iraq.
In New York, the British pound rose to $1.9305, from $1.9250 Monday. In London, the British pound rose to $1.9295, from $1.9260 late Monday.
In New York, the dollar closed at 126.15 Japanese yen, up from 125.70 yen late Monday. In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 126.18 yen, down 0.07 yen from Monday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 126.25 yen.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday, included: 1.3055 Swiss francs, down from 1.3165; 4.9430 French francs, down from 4.9635; 1,106.00 Italian lire, down from 1,111.00, and 1.19855 Canadian dollars, up from 1.19475.
The price of gold for August delivery fell $1.10, to $335.80 a troy ounce, on the New York Commodity Exchange.

HEADLINE: Japan Announces Series of Steps To Try to Halt Stock Market Slide

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Wednesday, Aug. 19

 BODY:
With another steep drop in share prices deepening the sense of crisis in Japan's financial system, the Finance Minister announced a series of measures Tuesday aimed at halting the two-and-a-half-year stock market slide.
The action was taken after the closely watched Nikkei average of 225 stocks plunged 620.14 points on Tuesday, or 4.2 percent, to 14,309.41, its lowest level in more than six years. 
 Stocks rebounded somewhat in trading today, but brokers remained cautious. They said that sentiment had been encouraged by the measures, but that most of the buying was for technical reasons. At the close today, the Nikkei regained 341.33 points, or 2.39 percent, to 14,650.74.
After the plunge on Tuesday, the average was down 13.5 percent in one month alone, and the market's fall since the end of 1989 has wiped out about $3.1 trillion, or 63 percent, of the value of the shares traded on the exchange in Tokyo.
In his package announced Tuesday, the Finance Minister, Tsutomu Hata, sought to put pressure on big investors not to sell shares and said financial institutions would be permitted to withhold negative financial data from the public in the hope of easing worries about the system's fundamental health. He also said steps would be taken to encourage Japanese banks to make more loans.
Financial experts generally said the measures did not go far enough. The best that could be said of the package, market experts and economists said, was that it showed that top Government officials have finally awakened to the severity of the troubles afflicting Japan's stock market and banking system, and to the impact on the economy.
Most said they feared the announcement could harm the market further by sidestepping the deeper problems of the market and the economy. The measures simply add to the sense, analysts said, that the financial system is careering from crisis to crisis with the Government unable to control it.
The severity of the decline in Japan's market in some ways exceeds some of the worst stock market crashes. In the United States in the 14 months after the crash of October 1929, the Dow Jones industrial average lost nearly 50 percent of its value, and in the 1987 crash the Dow lost more than 20 percent.
While the Government maintains that the economy will expand 3.5 percent in the current fiscal year, which ends March 31, most private economists say they expect growth of less than 2 percent, in part because of the problems in the badly shaken system.
"This was perhaps the first real admission from the Finance Minister that the situation is severe and that they have to do something," said Richard Koo, a senior economist at the Nomura Research Institute. "But as far as the content goes, I'm not impressed."
Added Alicia Ogawa, a financial analyst at S. G. Warburg Securities (Japan): "This is a dangerous game they are playing. The only thing keeping this system together is faith in the authorities, and this announcement doesn't inspire a lot of faith."
Mr. Hata announced a generally vague package of measures with these principal features:
*Financial institutions will be asked not to sell shares on which they can still record some profit before the fiscal half-year ends on Sept. 30. The ministry has no formal power to enforce this rule.
*The ministry will lift a rule that prohibits financial institutions from paying out more than 40 percent of their profits as dividends. As profits have shrunk, the fear has been that companies either will sharply cut dividends to stay within the 40 percent rule or will sell some stock holdings to inflate profits artificially.
*Financial institutions will be given the option of not reporting stock losses for the six-month period that ends Sept. 30. Instead they will be able to wait until March 31.
*Banks, which have drastically cut the growth of new loans, are to be encouraged to make more loans and to take steps for smooth write-offs of their growing burden of bad loans. The ministry will also help banks raise fresh capital to make up for the huge losses on their stock portfolios.
This is the third rescue package the Government has announced in the last five months. The previous two were aimed at stimulating the faltering economy not just the stock market. In both instances the Government said it would increase public-works spending and the Bank of Japan lowered interest rates. And in both cases, the stock market declined afterwards.
Although there is still no sense of panic in the stock market -- Tuesday's trading volume of 170 million shares was less than one-sixth the average volume on the exchange just a few years ago -- one of the biggest changes in recent weeks has been a realization that the severity of the market's decline has been sapping strength from the overall economy.
For much of the last two and a half years Government officials and business leaders have insisted that what happens in the market has little impact on what they like to call the "real economy." Now they have begun to see the connections between the tumbling value of stocks, the severe loan-loss problems at banks and the sharp slowdown in the economy.
The bank problems are at the heart of the issue. Japanese banks own huge stock portfolios, whose value makes up about half of their total capital. The plunging value of the stock market means their capital bases have been shrinking. That reduces their ability to lend, forces them to consider selling shares and weakens an already-slowing economy by limiting the amount of fresh credit available to help companies grow.
In fact, a vicious cycle has developed. While tumbling stock prices eat into banks' capital, the slowing economy has caused a record level of corporate bankruptcies, which add to the banks' burden of bad loans. Fearful of how the banks' loan losses could harm the economy, investors have been more inclined to sell shares.

HEADLINE: UNDER THE DOME: ISSUES -- THE ECONOMY;
Bush May Promise to Keep Baker As Manager of Economic Policy

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Aug. 18

 BODY:
To try to rebuild his credibility on economic matters, President Bush and his speech-writing team have discussed a proposal to have the President promise Thursday night to keep James A. Baker 3d at the White House after the election to manage economic policy, Administration officials said here today.
Mr. Baker, whose resignation as Secretary of State and appointment as Mr. Bush's chief of staff and campaign coordinator become effective Sunday, is said to be resisting the idea as gimmicky and too confining. 
 But discussion of the proposal illustrates a fundamental tactical puzzle that the White House must solve by Thursday. It needs to come up with a bold step or convincing promise of action that the President can make without reminding a national television audience that he is the man who broke the keystone pledge of his 1988 acceptance speech: "Read my lips. No new taxes."
The speech writers' deliberations also underscore the importance the President and his advisers place on finding some means of invigorating the campaign and breaking through his encrusted image as the passive guardian of the economic status quo.
 
Bad Economic News
 The need for an economic plan was given even greater urgency today after the Government announced that the pace at which builders broke ground for new homes slumped 2.8 percent in July. Combined with downward revisions for May and June, the skid meant that the housing sector not only was no longer pacing the lackluster recovery but was becoming a drag. [Page D1.]
Mr. Bush and his advisers view the Thursday night speech, in which he will accept his party's nomination for a second term, as a crucial opportunity to convince voters that he intends to deal decisively with the country's economic problems. But so far they have dismissed all suggestions for drastic new remedies for the weak economy.
As the speech has gone through one draft after another, the President, officials said, has more or less decided against proposing the kind of specific new tax cuts that have been recommended by Jack F. Kemp, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and others on the Republican Party's conservative flank.
Some of the President's advisers say that having broken the promise he made on taxes at the last Republican convention, Mr. Bush could open himself to ridicule with a comparably firm statement this year. "It would be a home run or a tremendous disaster," one adviser said. "It's just too risky."
Instead, officials said that unless someone has a brainstorm, Mr. Bush intends to take a broad approach that will place him and the party on the side of reducing taxes and controlling spending without saying precisely which taxes and spending programs would be involved, other than measures he has already offered that have been blocked in Congress.
 
'Making People Trust Him'
 "The President needs to use the speech to begin the process of making people trust him again when he talks about the economy," one official said. "That's not something you can do in one night, which is one reason that the 'big idea' approach has not gotten anywhere."
Mr. Bush's past speeches dealing with the economy have been seen as duds. In his State of the Union Message in January, he said, "I mean to speak of big things."
But then he offered a laundry list of disparate proposals that seemed to many analysts to have no enthusiasm or theme. He urged Congress to "modify the passive loss rule" and to "fund our H.O.P.E. housing proposal" -- words unlikely to instill confidence.
The economy section of Thursday night's speech is being drafted primarily by Richard G. Darman, the budget director, and Robert B. Zoellick, the Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, one of Mr. Baker's closest associates who will move with his boss to the White House.
Mr. Baker dealt with economic issues under President Ronald Reagan. He was White House chief of staff in Mr. Reagan's first term and Treasury Secretary in the second. Mr. Darman was his deputy throughout.
 
The Old and the New
 Mr. Darman was with the President at Camp David, Md., last weekend and flew here Monday with him on Air Force One. Interviewed today on the Cable News Network, he said:
"A good deal of what the President has to say will involve the old plan, because an awful lot of it makes sense and has not been enacted. But there will be some new things. But I wouldn't want to mislead you or your viewers. I think that the speech is likely to be more thematic."
Mr. Zoellick was still writing at a computer in the conference room of the Houstonian Hotel, where the President is staying, at midnight Monday.
Mr. Baker is at his ranch in Wyoming and will not arrive here until Wednesday, but he has kept in constant touch with the speech-drafting through Mr. Zoellick, aides said.
The principal speech writer is Raymond K. Price, who was Richard M. Nixon's chief speechwriter and has sporadically worked for other Republican Presidents. Robert M. Teeter, the campaign chairman, has been instrumental in drafting the parts of the speech not involving the economy.
Officials who have followed the drafting said the speech would deal in some detail with Mr. Bush's foreign policy successes and would try to draw distinctions between him and Republicans on the one hand and Gov. Bill Clinton and Democrats on the other.
But the economic theme is by far the most important one, the officials said, since the President and his advisers believe that is the ground on which the election will be decided.
Since early in his Presidency, Mr. Bush has received conflicting advice about the economy.
One wing of the party, represented by Mr. Kemp and others instrumental in the supply-side revolution of the Reagan years, holds that tax cuts are the key to growth. They have pressed the President to propose lower taxes and to battle Congress to win them.
 
Looking to the Deficit
 Another group that includes Mr. Darman, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, maintains that the budget deficit must be brought under control first.
Mr. Bush listened to the second group two years ago, when he broke his campaign promise and struck a deficit-reduction agreement with Congress that increased taxes by more than $130 billion over five years.
Many Republicans here believe that was the beginning of the President's political fall and the source of the credibility problem he is hoping to solve with his acceptance speech Thursday night. But other politicians question that judgment, saying that if the economy were strong, Mr. Bush's broken tax promise would be disregarded.
The Brady-Darman-Boskin camp argues that the President has suffered most from what they call false Democratic charges that he generally sides with the well-to-do over ordinary Americans. These advisers say that Mr. Bush would be sure to lose a tax-cut fight with the Democratic Congress, and that in the process the portrayal of the President as the patron of fat cats would be enhanced.
Mr. Kemp has often been at odds with Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, who delivered the Keynote Address on Tuesday night. Mr. Gramm, a Ph.D. economist, also advocates lower taxes but primarily stresses bringing the budget into balance. They are potential competitors for the Republican Presidential nomination in 1996.
Mr. Bush's speech will embrace a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, which Mr. Gramm champions, while rejecting Mr. Kemp's call for bold new tax proposals.
In his own speech Tuesday night, which was presumably cleared by the Bush camp, Mr. Kemp did not talk about the specific tax measures he was advocating publicly here last week.
Some politicians have been urging Mr. Bush to make big changes in his economic-policy staff, but his close friendship with Mr. Brady and the leading role Mr. Darman has played in drafting the speech seem to indicate that, for the time being at least, that advice is being rejected.
In political and economic circles, there is much speculation about how Mr. Baker's transfer to the White House will affect Mr. Darman.
Martin Anderson, an economist in the Reagan Administration who met with Mr. Bush last week, said he expected Mr. Darman to lose influence because he would be relegated to being Mr. Baker's deputy, a postition he held for most of the Reagan era. But other officials said Mr. Darman's position would be enhanced because Mr. Baker was so comfortable depending on him.

HEADLINE: Out of the Toolbox, Into the Kitchen

BYLINE: By FLORENCE FABRICANT

 BODY:
IT may not be long before chefs start wearing hard hats instead of toques. Many of them are already using equipment -- electric drills, blowtorches and such -- usually associated with construction work instead of cooking.
"Yeah, the blowtorch works great," said Alfred Portale, the chef at the Gotham Bar and Grill in New York. "It's the quickest, most direct way to glaze the top of a berry gratin or a creme brulee. You don't heat up the whole dessert when you just wave the torch over the top. You've got control." 
 Chefs are always looking for better, more efficient and economical methods of turning out good food. And sometimes this search takes them to the toolbox or the plumbing-supply store.
"I love to rummage in hardware stores because I'm always coming up with something interesting to use," said Michel Richard, the chef and owner of Citrus in Los Angeles.
Sometimes even the tack shop can be a source. "We use those brushes made for grooming horses to take the scales off fish," said Robert Del Grande, the chef and owner of Cafe Annie in Houston. So does Mark Peel, the chef and an owner of Campanile in Los Angeles. So the fact that Texas is horse country has nothing to do with taking the currycomb from stable to kitchen.
Ice carving is not an everyday kitchen activity, but chefs who do the elaborate banquet centerpieces often use chain saws to cut the blocks of ice. Among the chefs whose work includes creating the shimmering tours de force are Donald Donovan of the Millenium Hotel, which opened in June in lower Manhattan. Along with chain saws, the chefs rely on electric routers for carving the ice and ordinary household irons for smoothing the edges.
David Burke, the chef and an owner of Park Avenue Cafe in Manhattan is particulary fond of outlandish tools in the kitchen. He uses an electric drill with a special hollow bit to slice the kernels off corn on the cob. "The drill bit is like a cookie cutter, exactly the diameter of the cob so as it goes down, it shaves the kernels right off," he said. "Sometimes we just use it on the ends to make natural handles on the cob."
Using a drill in this manner may be unusual, but in restaurants today, the blowtorch has become common, replacing the broiler or salamander for burnishing a variety of foods. This fall, when "Trucs of the Trade" by Frank Ball and Arlene Feltman is published by HarperCollins, home cooks who read about chefs' cooking tricks -- trucs in French -- may follow suit. In telling how to achieve a crisp layer of caramelized sugar on creme brulee the way restaurants do, Hubert Keller, the chef and owner of Fleur de Lys in San Francisco, advised, "First, go to the hardware store and buy a propane torch."
But in many instances, a special purchase is not necessary. Sometimes, everyday equipment that is simply not associated with the kitchen is used. In "More Classic Italian Cooking" (Knopf, 1978), Marcella Hazan recommended using a blow-dryer on the skin of a duck before roasting. "This is to keep the pores wide open and ease the outflow of fat while roasting," she wrote.
Duck gets somewhat different treatment at the hands of Eileen Yin-Fei Lo, who teaches and writes about Chinese cooking. She uses a bicycle pump to separate the skin from the flesh of a whole duck and also suggests using a small electric fan to dry the duck before roasting it, Peking style, to insure crispness.
Rose Levy Beranbaum, the author of books on baking, relies on dental floss to slice horizontally through delicate cake layers more effectively than with a knife. Why dental floss? Her mother is a dentist.
A number of chefs use a time-honored Italian grandmother's trick to weight a butterflied chicken as it grills or sautes: they place a clean brick on top.
Mr. Richard of Citrus has started using glass chimneys for foie gras, stuffing the cylinders and then chilling them, so that he can slice perfect rounds as he pushes out the foie gras.
Most chefs rely on needle-nose pliers to remove pin bones from fish. These tough little vertical bones remain after filleting and can easily be detected by running a hand lightly over the fish. Chefs pull them out one by one with the pliers.
Plastic squeeze bottles are also used routinely in professional kitchens for edging desserts with multicolored borders, floating a decorative flourish of cream or herb-infused oil on a bowl of soup or covering a plate with Abstract Expressionist dots and swirls of sauce.
Plastic spray bottles can mist oil over, say, thin slices of potato before baking, a method that involves using less oil than a brush, reducing the fat for the customer and the expense for the restaurant. In Mr. Burke's kitchen at Park Avenue Cafe, a commercial paint sprayer is pressed into service when an even coating of chocolate is needed on a dessert or plate.
Another of his technical improvisations is to use lengths of ordinary copper plumbing pipe in the oven. He wraps the dough for skinny baguettes in parchment and bakes them inside the pipes so they hold their shape. "I got the idea when I worked in France and saw how the French baked their tall cylindrical brioches in coffee cans," Mr. Burke said. At the same time, lacy potato gaufrettes are laid on the outside of the pipes, to crisp into graceful curves as they brown.
Not so long ago chefs used $5 stainless-steel molds, imported from France, for creating tidy little cylinders of fish tartare, salad or grains to garnish a plate. Looking for something cheaper, a number of chefs first tried small tin cans, like tunafish cans, with the tops and bottoms removed. But these did not offer a range of sizes. So now chefs head for plumbing suppliers, where they buy white PVC pipe in various diameters. They cut the pipe to make rings of the desired size, and it's easy to make 30 or 40 rings at a fraction of the price of the French ones.
John Doherty, the executive chef at the Waldorf-Astoria, prefers a scalpel from a surgical supply company to a knife for some fine cutting and trimming jobs, especially with fibrous ingredients like leeks. Some chefs also use surgical syringes to infuse flavorings into meats and other foods.
Most of the time chefs resort to unusual, nonculinary equipment because it represents some improvement over the utensils regularly found in the kitchen. But they are also not immune to displays of bravura.
In the private dining room adjacent to the glassed-in open kitchen at Park Avenue Cafe, Mr. Burke astounds diners as he buzzes ears of corn with his drill. And sometimes at charity benefits, onlookers gape as Mr. Portale of Gotham Bar and Grill and a platoon of chefs aim flaming torches at hundreds of berry gratins.
"People get a real kick out of it," he said, "and besides, it's fun."

HEADLINE: IN THEIR OWN WORDS: THE OVERVIEW;
REPUBLICANS ASSAIL CLINTON AS RADICAL AND BIG SPENDER AND ASSERT BUSH STRENGTHS

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Aug. 18

 BODY:
The Republicans pressed their lacerating attack on Gov. Bill Clinton and the Democrats in Congress at their National Convention today, as speaker after speaker portrayed Mr. Clinton as a radical liberal who would coddle criminals, disarm America and break the economy with higher taxes and more Government spending.
President Bush worked in his hotel room with his advisers to devise an acceptance speech intended to restore the credibility of the "read my lips" candidate's economic promises. As if previewing his themes, Mr. Bush promised in interviews to put new faces in his Cabinet in a second term, restore economic growth and take a tougher line with Congress.
 
An Image of Diversity
 This produced a wave of reports across the Astrodome that the three men widely regarded as the architects of Mr. Bush's unpopular economic policies -- Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady; the budget director, Richard G. Darman; and the chief White House economist, Michael J. Boskin -- would be offered as sacrifices after the election. 
 In the Astrodome, there was no mention of Mr. Bush's broken promise not to raise taxes; apologies were left for the President himself to make on Thursday night. And the night's speeches were a dutiful effort to make the case for Mr. Bush's domestic policies that lacked the full-throated conservatism of Patrick J. Buchanan's speech the previous night or the nostalgic fire of Ronald Reagan's.
A parade of public officials representing minorities, the disabled and even abortion rights advocates took the stage to paint a picture of diversity and to praise President Bush and hammer away at the Republican themes for the fall campaign: Mr. Bush won the cold war and the war against Iraq, he represents "family values" and he is a skilled diplomat.
 
Contenders for '96 Speak
 After an opening night devoted to reassuring the party's conservative wing, today's events reached for a broader audience: from Barbara Bush's appearance at a morning meeting entitled "Black America Salutes the First Family," to the night's main attractions; the keynote address tonight by Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, a proponent of Federal budget cutting, and a speech by Housing Secretary Jack F. Kemp, the apostle of tax cuts and populist conservatism, who received a rousing welcome from a crowd waving signs bearing his name.
"At the New York convention, Clinton was like a used-car salesman peddling his vehicle for change," said Mr. Gramm, an ex-Democrat who along with Mr. Kemp is a leading contender for the Republican Presidential nomination in 1996. "The wax job was shiny, the hubcaps sparkled, the upholstery was spotless, the paint was new. But when you look under the hood, he's peddling a model from the 1970's, a Carter mobile with the axle broken and the frame bent to the left."
Appropriating the images of the Democratic National Convention, the Republicans peppered their speeches with references to their humble beginnings, pledges of tolerance and vows of racial harmony. Despite their adoption of a platform that demands a constitutional ban on abortion, the Republicans tried to heal their rift over the issue by allowing the rallying cry of the abortion rights movement to be sounded at their stage.
"I want the government out of your pocketbook and out of your bedroom," Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts declared, to an even mix of cheers and boos.
Mrs. Bush preached a message of tolerance and warmth on national television. "Don't be judgmental of others," Mrs. Bush said in an interview on CNN. "Everybody's different. Everybody has their own problems."
But behind the scenes, Republican strategists -- driven by the conviction that religion and cultural divides are still powerful tools -- unapologetically proclaimed their intention to follow Patrick J. Buchanan's declaration of a religious and cultural war with the Democrats.
 
Strength and Prosperity
 While Mr. Clinton was portrayed as a threat to the nation's security on Monday night, the line of today's attack was primarily on economic and social issues, coordinated by convention managers who were providing themes to speakers and reviewing their speeches in advance.
Like the Communists in North Korea and Cuba, Mr. Gramm said, the Democrats "believe that the answer to every problem is more government." Mr. Gramm set the tone for the Republicans' counteroffensive on domestic issues: Mr. Bush does have a program, he said, but the Democrats in Congress will not permit it to be enacted.
"Our President asked Congress for the tools to rebuild the economy and for weapons to win back our streets and Congress bent them and broke them and threw them away," Mr. Gramm said.
"Democrats," he said, "Democrats and Republicans agree on one thing: We both want change. The debate is not about who is for change; it's about the direction of the change. Today America stands at the crossroads. It's time for choosing: their way of more taxing or our way of more jobs; their way of more government or our way of more opportunity."
Another theme Mr. Gramm sounded was that the election of Mr. Clinton would lead to a weak America.
"We have not forgotten that the last Democrat in the White House so decimated defense that on any given day, 50 percent of our planes couldn't fly and our ships couldn't sail, because we didn't have spare parts and mechanics," Mr. Gramm said.
"Under Republican leadership, we changed all that," he said. "We modernized our weapons and we recruited and have retained the finest young men and women who have ever worn the uniform of this country. And they wear that uniform all over the world tonight with a new pride and a new confidence, and we Republicans are committed to keeping it that way."
He declared, "We must never -- we must never allow the Democrats to disarm America again."
As is his custom, Mr. Gramm relied heavily in his remarks on one Dicky Flatt of Mexia, Tex., a printer Mr. Gramm gives as an example of a small businessman whose modest resources should always be considered by Congress when it appropriates money.
 
Kemp Acts the Loyalist
 Mr. Kemp's speech, however, was notable for the absence of his favorite subject: the tax cut he has been trying to force on Mr. Bush. Instead, he was a loyal soldier, attacking the Democrats.
"The Democrats' New Covenant is not new," he said. "It's not change. It doesn't put people first; it puts government first. It doesn't empower people; it empowers bureaucracy. It doesn't encourage investment and growth; it spends, and spends and spends."
He added: "We've got a great team. And let me say as an old football player who played in this very stadium: we've got a great quarterback in George Bush."
Mr. Kemp also sought to link Mr. Bush's economic expertise to his international stature, relating a conversation he had with a former mayor of Moscow. The mayor told him he won election by advocating the right to own one's own home and pledging to make downtown a free enterprise zone. "I said, 'Mr. Mayor, where did you get these radical ideas?' " Mr. Kemp said. "He said, 'Mr. Kemp, I got them from the 1980 Republican platform of Ronald Reagan and George Bush.'
"Ladies and gentlemen," Mr. Kemp said, "Communism didn't fall. It was pushed."
After a brief appearance this morning at an anti-drug rally, President Bush and his advisers conferred in his suite in the Houstonian Hotel on a speechfor Thursday night intended to start the process of regaining voters' confidence in him as an economic manager and of re-establishing the credibility of his promises.
Taking a step toward that goal, Mr. Bush signaled today that he would revamp his Cabinet if he were re-elected. "You'll see plenty of new faces, plenty of changes in this Administration," he said in an interview on the "MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour."
There was no official confirmation of the reports about the departure of the top economic-policy officials. But senior campaign aides and Republican office-holders said Mr. Boskin needed to return around the end of the year to Stanford University, where he is a professor of economics, to retain his tenure. They also said the Mr. Brady and his wife have told friends that he did not wish to hold his job into a second term, but that Mr. Darman wanted to stay on.
In the interview, Mr. Bush also promised "a rather booming economy" in a second term and an even more aggressive stance with Congress, going on the offensive against individual lawmakers to sell his programs to the public.
 
Democrats Salt the Wound
 As Mr. Bush toiled, the political climate heated up with an unusual convention-week exchange between the two campaign organizations. In new television advertisements, the Democrats broadcast a commercial hitting a sore point of Mr. Bush: "On Nov. 5, 1990, George Bush signed into law the second-biggest tax increase in American history."
In the convention hall, the lineup of speakers seemed to imitate the Democrats' presentation in New York last month of minorities, women and the disabled. But the convention produced a far more mixed set of signals than the Democrats created in the Clinton-orchestrated convention. Uncertain of their ability to run on the economy, the Republicans were firing a scattershot of campaign themes, some borrowed from the last Presidential contest.
Speakers tried to tar Mr. Clinton with the American Civil Liberties Union, homosexual advocates and radical feminists. Attorney General Dan Lungren of California stunned the morning session into silence by resurrecting the Willie Horton case of 1988 and hurling it at Mr. Clinton as evidence that Democrats are soft on crime.
After months of criticism that its message was not getting through to voters, the Bush campaign moved to reinforce its advertising and communications staffs today, bringing in a veteran strategist, Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., to coordinate advertising strategy and policy. It expanded the role of two advisers, James Lake and Roger Ailes, making Mr. Lake communications director and Mr. Ailes a more frequent consultant.

HEADLINE: NEW YORK AGENCY CUTS APARTMENTS FOR THE HOMELESS

BYLINE: By JANE FRITSCH

 BODY:
Attributing an array of new problems in New York City's housing projects to a program to set aside thousands of apartments for homeless families, Housing Authority officials say they plan to sharply reduce the number of apartments given to the homeless in the future.
The shift in policy has created a division between the Housing Authority and other officials of the Dinkins administration who are scrambling to find homes for thousands of families each year and say they are counting on the Authority to provide apartments. 
 At stake, say Housing Authority officials, is the future of the city's 324 housing projects, home to more than 600,000 people. Adding more homeless families, the officials say, could upset the careful balance of low- and middle-income tenants that has produced some of the most successful public housing in the country.
The head of the Housing Authority, Sally Hernandez-Pinero, said she had told the Mayor's staff that the homeless families, many of them ill equipped to live on their own, had brought theft, drug abuse and other crimes to once-stable projects.
 
Promised Services Lacking
 "We told them that public housing is a short-term solution and they will pay a very big price in the long term," Ms. Hernandez-Pinero said in an interview yesterday. "They'll destroy the lives of 600,000 other people."
Over the last four years, more than 8,000 homeless families have been moved into city housing projects.
Officials of the city's Human Resources Administration, which operates homeless shelters, said yesterday that they were counting on the Housing Authority to provide 2,000 apartments for the homeless this year.
Mayor David N. Dinkins appointed Ms. Hernandez-Pinero, a longtime ally, to head the Housing Authority five months ago. The authority is a semi-autonomous agency financed by the Federal Government with a three-member governing board appointed by the Mayor.
Housing officials are also complaining that the city has failed to provide the homeless families -- many of whom are struggling with problems ranging from drug abuse to long-term unemployment -- with services it had promised. More than 80 percent do not even have furniture, Ms. Hernandez-Pinero said.
"There's clearly a growing problem," Ms. Hernandez-Pinero said. "We tracked our first 2,000 homeless families and it is clear that there is a high incidence of contact with the police department, drug dealing and harassment of other tenants."
James L. Capoziello, an H.R.A. official in charge of adult services, said yesterday that there was no reason to conclude that homeless people cause more problems than others who live in public housing. He said the H.R.A. had made substantial efforts to provide social services to the homeless who were placed in public housing and planned to increase the services.
Many experts have attributed the success of New York City's Housing projects to a longstanding practice of screening applicants and strictly apportioning apartments, assigning one third each to the elderly and to low- and middle-income families.
But in 1988 the authority made an exception. It made a four-year agreement with the administration of Mayor Edward I. Koch to put 2,000 homeless families annually at the head of a long waiting list for places in the city's housing projects. The average wait for the apartments is 12 years.
 
Concern About Dumping
 Since her appointment, Ms. Hernandez-Pinero has made reassessing the authority's role in aiding the homeless a priority. "I am deeply concerned that we do not dump large numbers of low-income people in public housing in a way that would destabilize the developments and make them impossible to manage," she said.
The policy of giving preference to the homeless has encouraged people to move into shelters, she said, as a way of jumping to the top of the waiting list for space in housing projects. The situation is unfair to those on the waiting list who are only "marginally housed" or living in overcrowded circumstances, she said.
Deputy Mayor Cesar A. Perales said Ms. Hernandez-Pinero's objections had been under discussion for more than a month and the matter had not yet been settled. "The issue is not whether they will take any families, but how many," he said. "It is proving difficult to come to that number."
Some 5,300 families are now living in homeless shelters and hotels and are awaiting placement in either public or private housing.
About 8,000 of the authority's 180,000 apartments are vacated each year. In recent months more than half of the vacancies have been going to the homeless and others with "very low income," Ms. Hernandez-Pinero said.
 
Complaints from Projects
 "We are taking families that have not been prepared to be responsible tenants," she said. "They have tremendous social service needs. We're not doing them any good and we're not doing the tenants any good."
Ada H. Gonzalez-Delgado, who supervises the handful of Housing Authority social workers in the Bronx, said she frequently encountered families from city shelters who were greatly in need of social services, but had received almost none.
Many of the families squander money they have been given to buy furniture because they do not know how to shop, she said. Some vastly overpay for household items and others spend their entire furniture allowance for big-screen televisions or stereo equipment, she said.
Wanda Gilliam, the manager of the Borinquen Plaza project in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, said there was tremendous resentment of homeless families. Many of the homeless, she said, "are not realistic about what living in a housing project means."
At the Stanley Isaacs project in Harlem yesterday Rose Bergin, the president of the tenants association, complained that a formerly homeless man was arrested and jailed on charges of rape and sodomy after moving into the complex. To the anger of many in the project, his newly renovated apartment has been kept empty for months since his arrest, Mrs. Bergin said.
Her husband, Jimmy, said he had been forced to call the police once because another of the formerly homeless "walking around nude right in front of the kids."
At the Borinquen Plaza project, two teen-age boys who had been moved in from a shelter terrorized residents for months, robbing them at gunpoint and stealing cars. Tenants complained repeatedly, but the authority was unable to evict them, Ms. Gilliam said. After 17 arrests, the boys are now in jail.
Ms. Hernandez-Pinero said the authority planned to institute a rigorous new screening process that would be applied to the homeless and all other applicants for public housing. Applicants will be screened for criminal records, rent payment history and their behavior while living in homeless shelters, she said.

Republicans this morning formally nominated President Bush for a second term, with Barbara Bush leading a nominating parade that cast her husband as the guardian of traditional family values and suggested that the Democrats were far less committed to the cause.
Mr. Bush continued to work on an acceptance speech for tonight that close advisers said would almost certainly include some kind of apology for his handling of the economy. But it was still being debated whether this should be a forthright confession of error for breaking his "no new taxes" pledge or a more general acknowledgement that he should have taken a tougher line on spending and the deficit. 
 The 2,210 delegates set aside their worries about the economy and the election and celebrated the ritual of renominating their President after hearing a beaming Mrs. Bush declare: "Tonight, you will nominate George Bush to lead our nation into its future. With all my heart I say -- and I know him best -- you've made a wonderful choice."
 
Head of the Family
 With that, Mr. Bush joined his family, 22 strong counting children and grandchildren, on the stage before the cheering crowd. It was a glowing tableau of familial warmth, evoking the kinder, gentler George Bush on the eve of what is expected to be a bitter and hard-fought campaign.
"We'll see you all tomorrow night," Mr. Bush said, as the chants of "Four more years" rolled on.
Mr. Bush was officially nominated by the Secretary of Labor, Lynn Martin, who was part of the parade of women who came to the lectern to endorse the President. She also struck another main theme of the convention -- that Mr. Bush has had, on balance, a successful Presidency and has insured an era of Pax Americana.
"Our children can now go to bed in peace and not wake to the fear of nuclear war," Ms. Martin said. "Are we better off than four years ago? Of course we are."
Mr. Bush received the necessary 1,106 delegate votes and went over the top at 12:10 A.M. local time, with the votes of his adopted state, Texas.
A short time after the roll-call, Vice President Dan Quayle was renominated by acclamation.
 
Flag and Nationhood
 Much of the evening was devoted to a theme that Republican strategists hope will win back many of the middle-class voters who have left Mr. Bush because of the economy. Republicans, who seized the symbols of flag and nationhood in 1988 to powerful effect, presented themselves last night as the party of the American family, and presented the Bushes as emblematic of the ideal.
There were two sides to the politics of family here last night -- one embodied by the motherly, embracing oratory of Mrs. Bush, the other by pointed commentary by Marilyn Quayle that seemed intended to evoke an unflattering comparison with Gov. Bill Clinton and his wife, Hillary.
Mrs. Quayle gave a combative speech that raised once again the old dividing lines of the 1960's, between those who joined the "counterculture" and those who did not, and a more modern division between career women and those who "love being mothers or wives, which gives our lives a richness that few men or women get from professional accomplishment alone."
Mrs. Bush, whose poll ratings far exceed her husband's and who surrounded herself on the stage with her children and grandchildren, struck an inclusive and tolerant tone. She recounted her own traditional life, but pointedly reached out to parents who follow a different path.
"You may be exhausted from working a job, or two jobs, and taking care of your children, or you may have put your career on hold," Mrs. Bush said. "Either way, you may wonder, as I did every now and then, am I really doing the right thing?"
She paused, looked over the sprawling hall and into the television cameras, and answered, "Yes, you are."
It was a night that gave a feminine voice and face to a party that has often suffered from a gender gap. Among the women who spoke was Mary Fisher, an artist from a prominent Republican family who is infected with the AIDS virus. She talked of her worries for the nation's children in the epidemic, in a speech that moved many of the delegates to tears and served as a gentle rebuke to a party often accused of not doing enough on AIDS.
"People with H.I.V. have not entered some alien state of being," Ms. Fisher said."They are human.
"They have not earned cruelty, and they do not deserve meanness."
Ms. Fisher, who ended with a poignant thought of how she would like to be remembered by her two children, said, "We do the President's cause no good if we praise the American family but ignore a virus that destroys it."
On the third night of their 35th convention, the Republicans, fortified by a poll that showed their offensive was taking a toll on the Democratic nominee, pressed their attacks on Mr. Clinton. A survey by CBS News showed that negative opinions of Mr. Clinton had risen this week while positive views were dropping. Opinions about Mr. Bush had improved, though only marginally.
Earlier Wednesday, Mr. Bush continued to try to rally a nervous party, predicting that the American people would inevitably return to his side as a man who could be trusted with the Presidency. In a speech to a Republican National Committee luncheon, Mr. Bush blasted the Democrats as the "Government-first crowd," a play on their convention promise to "put people first."
In keeping with the theme of the day, he also talked of his life as a young oilman, raising his family in West Texas. "I remember the rhythms of that part of our country, the rhythms of West Texas, Friday night football, Saturday night picnics, and the Sunday sermon," said Mr. Bush, whose speech was interrupted by demonstrators chanting, "What about AIDS?"
Wednesday night, Mr. Bush appeared from the wings of the convention stage after his wife and their 16-year-old grandson, George Prescott Bush, spoke of their love and respect for the President as a family man. Mr. Bush plunged into the embrace of the younger children as the convention rose in applause.
 
Mood Turns Somnolent
 But after the appearance of the First Family, which was timed for maximum television exposure but pushed the nominating procedure back into the early morning hours, the excitement quickly faded. By midnight local time, when the delegates were about halfway through the nominating roll call, complete with evocations of hometown sports teams and even, in the case of Idaho, a paean to the official state tuber, the atmosphere went from electric to somnolent.
The vast stadium was three quarters empty, the VIP booths were abandoned, and delegates, funny hats pulled down over their eyes, sprawled across chairs, sound asleep.
Even as the ritual of rallying behind the President proceeded, the White House still had considerable political work to do. It tried to tamp down rumors on Wednesday about a Cabinet shake-up, speculation that was spurred by Mr. Bush's comments in a PBS interview on Tuesday night that his second Administration would have a new face. And within the Administration, the scrambling continued on Mr. Bush's acceptance speech, which Republican strategists say is critical to restoring his credibility on the economy and domestic policy in general.
 
Rebuilding Trust
 Dealing with his broken vow of "no new taxes," made four years ago when he accepted the nomination in New Orleans, is a central part of the challenge. Mr. Bush has said more than once that he made a mistake when he signed on to the 1990 budget agreement that included new taxes, but a senior Administration official suggested that more was coming: "It's not only what he wants to do; a lot of people think he's got to talk about it if he wants to win people back."
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d was in the convention hall of the Astrodome last night as he moved toward taking control of the Bush re-election drive. One senior Republican close to the Administration predicted a major shake-up after Mr. Baker's return. Roger Ailes, Mr. Bush's 1988 media director, was on hand, as well, to assist in speech preparation.
Among the ideas being considered, in a week filled with Adminstration brainstorming on how to generate some momentum for the Bush campaign, was a threat to veto legislation appropriating Congressional salaries unless Congress passes his economic proposals. But a senior Administration official suggested that this kind of brinksmanship with Congress could be counterproductive.
 
Democrats See Distraction
 For their part, Democrats asserted that Mr. Bush was simply trying to distract the American people from the ailing economy with all the pro-family oratory. Mr. Clinton himself on Wednesday tried to seize the moral high ground in the daily war of television images. The Arkansas Governor joined his wife, Hillary; his running mate, Senator Al Gore of Tennessee, Tipper Gore and former President Jimmy Carter in building a house in Atlanta. "We thought it would be a good day to be building, not tearing down," Mr. Clinton said.
Republican strategists denied that they were appealing to social divisions, insisting they were only drawing a contrast with the Democrats on a range of cultural issues and taking a stand with middle America. But Kevin Phillips, a conservative analyst, asserted that the party was trying to "resurrect and repackage" a set of cultural issues that helped create the Republican coalition of the late 1960's, as well as "playing indirectly" to the allegations of infidelity involving Mr. Clinton.
Mrs. Quayle appealed to the voters of the baby boom generation last night -- the ones, she said, who did not "join the counterculture," or demonstrate, or take drugs, or "dodge the draft" or believe "that the family was so oppressive that women could only thrive apart from it."
She did not mention Hillary Clinton, who has been denounced from the Republican stage this week as a militant feminist lawyer who equates marriage with slavery, a charge that Democrats assert is ludicrous. But the comparison was implicit.
Mrs. Quayle noted that she left her law practice to work on her husband's campaigns and raise their children and said she had no regrets. "Most of us love being mothers or wives, which gives our lives a richness that few men or women get from professional accomplishment alone," Mrs. Quayle said.
The Rev. Pat Robertson, the television evangelist who ran for the Republican nomination four years ago, also weighed in on the American family last night. "George Bush's vision for America, ladies and gentlemen, is one of faith in God, strong families, freedom, individual initiative and free enterprise," Mr. Robertson said.
"The vision of Bill Clinton is a liberal welfare state that dominates every facet of our lives, burdens free enterprise, redistributes wealth, raises taxes and weakens the family," he said.
Mr. Robertson asserted that Mr. Clinton would "make sexual preference a privileged minority under our civil rights laws" and was "running on a platform that calls for saving the spotted owl, but never once mentions the name of God."
 
Plea for Compassion
 Republican officials said the family-values debate had to do with policies, not personalities. They said that on issues from tuition vouchers for private and religious schools to a private approach to the health-care crisis, Mr. Bush clearly favors policies that would give more power and support to families. In contrast, they argued, Mr. Clinton backs an approach to domestic problems that stresses more of a governmental solution.
The CBS Poll released Wednesday night, based on interviews conducted Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, showed that Mr. Clinton was now viewed favorably by 30 percent of the registered voters, and unfavorably by 31 percent. That marked a deterioration from his standing last week, when he was viewed favorably by 36 percent, unfavorably by 24 percent. The latest poll was based on interviews with 642 registered voters and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.
Another poll released Wednesday, conducted by The Washington Post and ABC News, showed Mr. Clinton holding a 25-point lead, but it was based on interviews conducted Friday through Tuesday.

Making and Remaking a Political Identity: George Herbert Walker Bush

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Aug. 19

 BODY:
It was torture, in 1988, for George Bush to try to explain who he was. Plucking at his chest, as though he could pull his soul out of a buttoned-down shirt, he told campaign aides, "We got to get me out there; we got to get more of me out there."
Throughout his Presidency, he has known, as he once put it, that people were "trying to figure out what makes this crazy guy tick" and wondering whether "there was some there there -- if not in me then in others" around him. 
 Perhaps there has never been a politician who has labored so long, and so reluctantly, to define and redefine, explain and explain yet again, who he is. Four years after pledging to reveal his "heartbeat" in a convention speech, he was frantically working until the last minute on a speech intended to show "what is in my heart."
George Herbert Walker Bush is an existential Yankee -- born in Milton, Mass., reared in Greenwich, Conn., and now living in the moment -- who never seems to understand why he cannot just be. He draws strength from his title. He is President, and therefore he is doing something right, he will tell those who challenge him.
But the problem is this: George Bush has projected many different versions of George Bush over the years, trying to court and hold a disparate coalition. His image now is not so much like his bold bronze statue in the Astrodome, with gaze fixed and body standing firm against the wind. It is more like a hologram that changes depending on the angle from which you look at it.
He can be charming. He can be whiny. He can be passive. He can be hyperactive. He can be conservative. He can be moderate. He can be firm. He can be, as an aide once said, a victim of his last conversation. He bashes Democrats in Congress. He eats barbecue at the White House with Democrats in Congress.
With his mother's voice in one ear, reminding him not to gloat, he can be modest. With his own voice in the other ear, reminding him that he has completed many important missions, he can be proud and confident.
He can be principled, seeming unconcerned about the political cost, as he was when he stood up to Saddam Hussein and when he insisted that Israel freeze settlements in the West Bank as a condition for $10 billion in loan guarantees.
But more often, as with his shifting stands on abortion, taxes and civil rights, political costs seem to determine his principles.
In the most revealing comment ever made about Mr. Bush, the late C. Fred Chambers, a Texas oil executive and a close friend, explained why Mr. Bush, as a young politician in Houston, had changed to a more progressive position on civil rights. "George understands that you have to do politically prudent things to get in a position to do what you want," he said.
Democrats, predictably, put it less kindly. "You can't find an issue in the last 30 years that George Bush hasn't been on both sides of, with the exception of cutting the capital gains tax," said James Carville, a strategist for Gov. Bill Clinton.
Indeed, Mr. Bush's strongest conviction has been born of his class. The boy nicknamed "Poppy" who rode out the Depression in a chauffeured sedan that ferried him to Greenwich Country Day School, the boy whose father was a pillar of the Wall Street establishment, grew up believing that what fuels America is capital and that its preservation is of paramount importance.
"He thinks Bill Clinton would be a disaster as President because he doesn't understand capitalism, as we perceive it," said Jonathan Bush, the President's younger brother.
 
Political Chameleon Eager to Please
 Ever since he began his political career in Houston in the early 1960's, when he appalled his moderate supporters by soothing the John Birch Society-types in the Goldwater movement, Mr. Bush has been making one Faustian bargain after another, veering between the right wing he needed and the moderate Republican wing that was his heritage. He was brought up in a world that valued public service, internationalist goals and noblesse oblige, the responsibility of the powerful to help the less powerful.
It is the worst fear of some friends that he may have sold off too many pieces of himself, in the mistaken belief he could someday get them back; that in his boyish eagerness to avoid conflict, to knit together opposing groups, to please everyone, he may have lost the ability to project a simple, coherent set of political ideas.
Mr. Bush's friend, Thomas (Lud) Ashley, a Washington lobbyist who was a Democratic Congressman from Ohio, said the President "finds it hard to get emotionally involved in passionate dislike of one side or another."
"He's not a confrontational guy; he'd rather get along," Mr. Ashley said of the President, who is about to stake his re-election on attacking the Democratic Congress. "He likes Tom Foley and George Mitchell personally."
Mr. Ashley said Mr. Bush's distaste for domestic affairs came from his belief that it is hard to get anything done. "Domestically, he finds it very difficult to get away from what people expect in terms of programs, promises and benefits of one kind or another," Mr. Ashley said. "He finds it difficult to make appealing the idea of more individual self-reliance through better education."
 
Following Footsteps Of a Notable Father
 Mr. Bush had always strived to measure up to the standards of conduct set by his 6-foot-4-inch father, Prescott Bush, a craggy faced investment banker who preceded his son at Yale and in Skull and Bones, the Yale secret society, and in Congress, as a Senator from Connecticut.
His father did not make much of a mark in his two terms in Congress, although he often played golf with his friend, President Dwight D. Eisenhower, at the Burning Tree Country Club.
But Bush pere always made an impression with his rectitude. At an early manufacturing job in St. Louis, he turned his boss in to the police for skimming profits. He would leave a party if anyone used dirty talk, and, even as a freshman Senator, he stood up to Joe McCarthy.
The first time George Bush returned to the family compound at Kennebunkport, Me., after his election as President, he landed on a green and excitedly told the assembled townsfolk, "We zoomed in there in a great big helicopter, and I wondered what my old man would say if he could see his little boy now."
During the 1988 campaign, when it was suggested that Prescott Bush would have been shocked by the ferocity of his son's right-wing themes, George Bush replied, "Well, I think my Dad would be pretty proud of me because I think we've come a long, long way."
Tellingly, Nancy Ellis, the President's sister, cited only one instance when her brother, normally mild-mannered and anxious to please, reminded her of their father: Mr. Bush's recent angry encounter with the families of American servicemen missing in Southeast Asia. "When George said, 'Shut up and sit down,' that was absolutely Dad," she said.
The President's 91-year-old mother, Dorothy, a tennis champion from a wealthy family, was equally starchy, berating her children if they tried to take too much credit for winning at sports. Now, Mr. Bush, at 68, still worries aloud in public about his mother catching him bragging about his accomplishments, especially the war in the Persian Gulf.
Mr. Bush married in 1945. He and his wife, Barbara, have five children; a sixth child died young.
Although Mr. Bush gets intensely uncomfortable with personal scrutiny -- "Don't put me on the couch," he says -- his Presidency has been largely based on personality.
He wants Americans to elect him, not because of ideas, but because he has been bred and educated for public service, and because he is someone they can trust in any situation that arises to do the "right" thing. He presents it as his great accomplishment that he has kept the White House "decent" and "honorable."
Mr. Bush is so focused on the ritual of the Presidency and his role as the caretaker of the office that he usually refers to himself as "the President."
Just so, his longtime supporters rarely point to his politics when they explain their devotion. They just point to Mr. Bush, himself.
 
A Presidency Of Personality
 The reason the "trust" theme will be the main theme of the 1992 campaign is not simply because Mr. Bush sees it as the most potent way to contrast himself with Bill Clinton.
When he says, "Trust me," he is not just saying, "Don't trust the other guy," although that is an important part of his message. He is also coming back to the idea that it is the person you elect, not the party nor the ideology. When Mr. Bush campaigns, he puts on a new persona with the alacrity that he puts on a campaign T-shirt, and when the campaign is over, he takes it off just as fast.
The day after he was elected in 1988 he reassured reporters at a news conference that they would never again see "George the Ripper," the candidate who had conducted a campaign so negative that his campaign manager, Lee Atwater, would apologize for it before he died.
"Oh, that's all history," Mr. Bush said, dismissing the idea that campaign oratory has lasting meaning as though flicking lint off his lapel.
Again, when Richard G. Darman, Mr. Bush's budget chief, told the President that he could break his "no new taxes" pledge because Americans did not expect politicians to keep their campaign promises, that made sense to Mr. Bush -- the disconnection between election oratory and just being yourself as President.
 
Gentle Moments, In the White House
 Asked what the President is made of, his friends, family and advisers offer small gentle moments, not large dramatic ones.
His sister remembers the time last spring when she and her friend Jean Wallace Douglas were bird-watching amid the shrubs on the White House lawn near the tennis court. "I heard this 'Tweet, tweet, tweet' that sounded like spring warblers," she said, "and we swung our binoculars around and it was George, hiding in the grass, surrounded by the Secret Service."
Although Mr. Bush has not consistently been seen as a strong leader, his brother Jonathan said George was a pied piper as a youth. "Everyone was drawn to him," he said. "Morris Greenberg, the groundskeeper of Yale, spent more time at George Bush's house there than all the other baseball players. And George would never say, 'Hey, Morris, it's time to go home.' "
His Presidential counsel, C. Boyden Gray, recalls that in the midst of a bad week last week the President still had time to tease him about the mythical tennis-ranking committee, whereby Mr. Bush keeps track of how his tennis Cabinet is doing.
The President has not governed on the basis of ideas, but on the basis of people. He puts the people he believes in around him, and they make it up as they go along -- most notably Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser, and Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney.
"I would hate to be President without friendships," Mr. Bush said in the first year of his Presidency.
When he needed Mr. Baker to come back and run his campaign, he developed an ideological argument to justify a pragmatic move. He took his argument that foreign policy and domestic policy are intertwined and used it to explain that he wanted Mr. Baker in the White House to take care of the country while he is out campaigning. But it was clear to everyone that Mr. Bush wanted Mr. Baker to take care of his campaign.
Mr. Baker was needed to rescue the President, even though that was a blow to Mr. Bush's pride, because Mr. Bush divides the world into peers and the help, and only a peer like Mr. Baker could really grab him by shoulders and get him to focus.
Even Mr. Bush's area of expertise, foreign policy, was based on personal relationships. Mr. Scowcroft said Mr. Bush had "established a fundamentally new aspect of the Presidency, which is personal diplomacy, which he has elevated to an art form."
All of this served Mr. Bush well, Mr. Scowcroft said, at a time when the old structures of world politics seemed to be collapsing. Mr. Scowcroft, who has served three Presidents, recalled Mr. Bush trying to break the ice with stodgy President Francois Mitterrand of France by speaking to him in his schoolbook French before the official translators arrived.
But because personality was the cement of his Administration and because he has expended so much energy in getting people to like him, Mr. Bush has found it difficult to go into reverse when he must. Although Mr. Bush hates personnel confrontations, he can wield the bat when the choice is between a subordinate, no matter how loyal, and his own survival.
It took him months, but he fired John H. Sununu as chief of staff, and he did not hesitate to cut loose Mr. Sununu's successor, Samuel K. Skinner, when he needed to make room for Mr. Baker. Now, there are rumors that he will offer up some of his top economic advisers as an election-year sacrifice to the conservatives.
 
A Career Promoted By Close Friends
 The two most formative episodes in Mr. Bush's young life were his experiences in the Navy, where he was shot down in the Pacific as a fighter pilot, and his membership in Skull and Bones.
His faith in personal contacts is borne out because he believes they led him to the Presidency. He is a product of an old boy's network that offered him a prestigious trellis, as he climbed from elective office -- the House -- to appointive office -- United Nations Ambassador, chairman of the Republican Party, envoy to China, Director of Central Intelligence.
In 1988, when he was 17 points behind Michael S. Dukakis in the polls, he was asked how he could possibly win. "I have friends," Mr. Bush replied. As it turned out, his friends -- from Ronald Reagan to James Baker to the 2,000 or so political pals in his famous Rolodex -- pulled him through.
"George has 75 hours in his day," his brother Jonathan said. "Otherwise, he could not call and write letters to so many people."
Where his personal charm can be effective one on one, Mr. Bush has failed to connect with the country at moments when Americans are starving for a leader to articulate their anger, anxiety or excitement.
One of the Democrats' campaign themes this year has been that, no matter how decent his instincts, it is hard for Mr. Bush, given his upbringing and his life experiences, to comprehend how difficult life can be for the have-nots.
In Nicholas King's "George Bush: A Biography," Nancy Ellis remembers visits to their grandfather Walker's South Carolina plantation in the 1930's. "I still remember the wonderful food and the care taken over the slightest things, like the trimmed edges of the grapefruit," she said. "We were waited on by the most wonderful black servants who would come into the bedrooms early in the morning and light those crackling pine-wood fires. It used to be freezing."
Jonathan Bush says the criticism is unfair -- "No one ever said that Jack Kennedy had a problem understanding the disadvantaged," he said -- but Mr. Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle must still fight criticism that they govern in a tight circle of affluent white men, with little diversity and not enough empathy.
Indeed, Mr. Bush sometimes acts offended when his Administration's policies are linked to him, personally.
Asked once in 1988 how he could portray himself as a good candidate for black Americans, since he had silently watched for eight years as the Reagan Administration watered down civil rights laws and never once invited black leaders to the White House, Mr. Bush looked genuinely hurt. "But I helped found the Yale chapter of the United Negro College Fund," he replied.
 
Delayed Responses, Muddled Stands
 Last winter, when Americans began to express anxiety about the declining economy and the fate of the country -- fears that Patrick J. Buchanan used to fuel his challenge to the President -- Mr. Bush rejected all pleas from advisers to move swiftly to speak to the country and lay out an economic program.
Instead, he took his budget chief's advice and waited more than a month, until his State of the Union Message, so fixed on Washington's political calendar that he could not understand why he should say anything earlier to the rest of the country.
Mr. Bush said he did not want to answer his election rivals until the formal campaign began in the fall. But that does not explain why he could not have reassured Americans about where the country was going. That is governing, not politics.
It also does not explain why, in interview after interview, even when he was given notice that he would be asked about his goals, the President seemed befuddled, offering banalities about "the whole domestic tranquility in a better-educated America."
Whenever he has been asked why he wanted to be President, he mumbles something like, "Challenges, rewards," as he did in 1988, or talks about the honor of serving, as he does now.
Even in foreign affairs, which does interest him, he could never explain why America had the moral obligation to intervene in the Persian Gulf, but not in Sarajevo.
What Mr. Bush has seen in the last year is the limits of a pragmatic, status quo, spontaneous Presidency.
In 1988, it may have been enough to stand before the Republican National Convention and say that America was yearning for a new leader and "I am that man."
In 1992, his advisers concede, Americans are tired and disillusioned with the politician they turned to fend off the Soviet Union. Mr. Bush, who admits that elections are times of renewal, must now find a vivid new shade in his coat of many colors so he can again be "that man," this time for a country that wants its own problems solved.

HEADLINE: A Shield for the Shiites;
The Use of U.S. Air Power in Southern Iraq Can Protect Rebels, With a Nod to Politics

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 19

 BODY:
The decision by the United States and its allies to place a protective military umbrella over the southern third of Iraq is a complete reversal of a policy adopted and aggressively defended just after the Persian Gulf war.
In March 1991, the Bush Administration concluded that shooting down Iraqi helicopters to thwart a crackdown on the Shiite Muslims in southern Iraq would be the first step toward a military quagmire. Today some of the same officials who once urged caution are sounding the alarms, building the case for combat patrols to protect the Shiites. 
 The dramatic turnabout reflects a shift in tactics for undermining President Saddam Hussein and what Administration officials describe as a better understanding of who the Shiites in southern Iraq really are: a persecuted people, and not necessarily the precursors of a radical Islamic state that would align itself with Iran.
 
What About Ground Attacks?
 It is also a way for the Republican White House to demonstrate its resolve in the face of Democratic criticism that Washington ended the gulf war prematurely and that its postwar policy toward Baghdad has been indecisive.
Though Administration officials insist that the patrols, which will be carried out together with British and French forces, are not motivated by election-year politics, they acknowledge that taking a sterner stance toward Iraq is likely to be politically popular.
Although the official reaction to the plan in Arab countries has been muted, many governments fear it may foster instability in the region. [Page A8.]
As a military proposition, the mission to protect Iraqi Shiites south of the 32d parallel is not viewed as especially difficult, though any mission over hostile territory risks casualties. While the Iraqi military has deployed SA-2 and SA-6 antiaircraft missiles in the area, Iraq's air defense system is operating at only one-third of its prewar capability, United States officials say.
Even with an allied air umbrella, Mr. Hussein's forces could still attack the Shiites with tanks and artillery. Bush Administration officials have not said what the allies would do then.
Having proclaimed the need to protect the Shiites, the allies would be hard-pressed not to respond with air strikes to any large-scale ground attacks. In that sense, the decision to establish a defensive umbrella may risk still deeper United States military involvement. But unlike the situation just before the gulf war, nobody is talking about sending ground forces against the Iraqi Army.
 
The Precedent of the Kurds
 The Administration's military involvement inside Iraq has been a reluctant one. After the gulf war, the United States helped set up a Kurdish enclave in the north, but only after British pressure and a flood of public sympathy stirred by television pictures of desperate Kurds fleeing Iraqi forces after a failed rebellion. Today, the United States Air Force flies 40 to 60 flights a day out of Turkey over the Kurdish region, indicating that imposing an air umbrella over the south need not be difficult.
Still, the allies had been reluctant to protect the Shiites. In March 1991, with victorious United States Army divisions in the Euphrates Valley and warplanes routinely flying over Iraq, the Administration watched as the Iraqi military ruthlessly crushed a Shiite rebellion, blowing up mosques and strafing the Shiites from helicopter gunships.
At the time, Administration officials argued that while shooting down the Iraqi helicopters looked like an easy thing to do, Iraq could turn into a quagmire. The idea of limiting involvement to protecting the Shiites from air attacks also ran afoul of the Pentagon's doctrine of using overwhelming force to win a decisive victory, so convincingly applied in driving Iraqi troops from Kuwait.
 
No 'Halfway Measures'
 "Somebody said we'll just shoot down helicopters," Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said on April 15, 1991, justifying the refusal to intervene militarily in southern Iraq. "Well, helicopters aren't the only problem. He's got tanks, he's got artillery, and if you're going to get involved in a military action, if you're going to use United States military force, you're going to send our young men and women into combat, we don't like to do it with halfway measures.
"And one of the reasons we were so successful in the gulf at holding casualties down as low as we did on our side, was because we went with overwhelming force," he added.
Another senior Administration official summed up Washington's decision not to protect the Shiites then in one word: geopolitics.
By that he meant that the Administration wanted to maintain the territorial integrity of Iraq as a buffer against Iran. With the possibility of a power vacuum in Baghdad after the gulf war, the Administration feared that any steps to help the Shiites could lead to the creation of an independent Shiite state with links to Teheran.
 
Convincing the Iraqis
 Bush Administration officials say they do not favor a breakup of Iraq. But their apprehensions about establishing a protected Shiite enclave -- particularly their fear that such an entity would be subsumed by or indebted to neighboring Iran -- have receded.
The creation of a protected zone in southern Iraq is seen rather as a way to demonstrate to the Iraqi military the costs of allowing President Hussein to remain in power. The air patrols send the message not only that Iraq is subject to economic sanctions, but that Baghdad's sovereignty over its own territory will be compromised unless the President is ousted.
 
What Would Be Needed
 Administration officials conceded privately that Washington knew little about the Shiites when the gulf war ended, failed to anticipate their uprising and tended, wrongly, to lump them with the Iranians. Saudi officials have recently played an important role in allaying some of the wariness about bolstering the Shiites, Administration officials say.
And with the Bush Administration proclaiming foreign policy as its strong suit during the election campaign, and Democrats complaining that President Hussein has been thumbing his nose at Washington, the establishment of the protected zone is seen as a way to cut the Iraqi leader down to size.
Continuing reports from the region, including videotapes of Iraqi raids against the Shiites and a study by the United Nations Human Rights Commission on abuses by the Iraqi military in southern Iraq, have added to the pressure to act.
Protecting the Shiites from air attack could involve 80 to 100 flights a day over southern Iraq and northern Saudi Arabia. And while no Administration officials have talked openly about the possibility of bombing raids, the allies would face considerable pressure to respond if the Iraqis launched ground assaults on Shiites. Such counterattacks would likely be carried out by F-15E's and F-111F's and by Navy A-6's.
While the Administration has discarded its earlier arguments against protecting the Shiites, officials may well have been right when they said last year that an allied threat to shoot down Iraqi aircraft might open the door to further military steps.

HEADLINE: British Racial Attacks Grow, Alarming Minorities

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Aug. 19

 BODY:
Ruhullah Aramesh fled his native Afghanistan eight months ago, bound for what he hoped would be a better life in England. This month, the 24-year-old immigrant was dead, killed by a group of white teen-agers on a South London street.
Mr. Aramesh, the police said, was the victim of pure racial hatred. Set upon by young toughs after he tried to stop them from harassing a group of female relatives, he was knocked to the ground and repeatedly struck on the head with iron bars, clubs and a sawed-off pool cue. 
 Five teen-agers have been arrested in the beating, during which, witnesses say, the assailants repeatedly shouted, "Die, you Paki!" Paki is a racial epithet broadly used to refer to immigrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and other South Asian nations.
In poorer parts of inner London, where one of every five residents is a nonwhite member of an ethnic minority, the killing of Mr. Aramesh has had a numbing effect. It has reinforced the worst fears of those who say immigrants and ethnic minorities, who make up less than 5 percent of Britain's population, are increasingly the target of racial abuse or violence.
 
Scapegoats for Economic Woe
 "Such things seems to happen even more when the economy is bad," said Manibhai Patel, who runs the Asian Community Action Group in Brixton, a South London district where many black and Asian families live. "We are the scapegoats. We are the prey."
Statistics made public by Scotland Yard showed 3,373 incidents of racial assault or harassment in London in 1991, a jump of 16 percent over the previous year. About half involved physical assault.
A national survey by a civil rights group last April similarly concluded that incidents of racial assault reported to police agencies in England and Wales grew by nearly a third between 1988 and 1990, to 6,459.
Civil rights organizations and counselors who work among minority groups here argue that the incidents are the most extreme expression of deep-seated racial tensions tugging at the seams of British society, aggravated by a growing population of nonwhites, many of them new immigrants, and a persistent economic recession that has exacted its heaviest toll among the poor and least educated.
Like America, those tensions are usually most acute in racially mixed, low-income neighborhoods where the competition for scarce jobs and housing is already marked, and where new immigrants from Asia or the West Indies are most likely to concentrate.
 
Problems Everywhere<HE
"We all know about Rodney King and what happened in Los Angeles," said Afsana Yahiya, who counsels victims of racial abuse in East London. "But the problems are here, they are everywhere, and the more we acknowledge that, the better for all of us."
In some cases, conflicts have been inflamed by racist gangs, including skinheads or others allied with the British National Party, a small but vocal militant group that appeals to the most xenophobic elements within Britain's class-conscious society. Active in working-class neighborhoods, the group campaigns on the slogan, "Rights for Whites."
Police officers caution that the statistical increase in hate crime may more accurately measure the greater scrupulousness of police and community agencies in keeping track of racist attacks. But civil rights groups say no statistics accurately measure the degree to which ethnic minorities are subjected to racial abuse and intimidation, including physical violence.
"I think any numbers we see seriously understate the degree to which these incidents occur," said Peter Laing of the Congress of Racial Equality. He said one survey in Newham, a London neighborhood, suggested that only one in 20 incidents of racial abuse or assault was reported to the police.
Those incidents involve a wide range of abuse, from physical assault to vandalism, like breaking windows, spraying racist graffiti on walls or pushing excrement through mail slots.
Zakir Khan, a counselor who says he deals with three to four cases of interracial conflict a week from a storefront office in Tower Hamlets, a borough in East London, said many Asian people did not report incidents to the police.
"I have dealt with older Bengalis or Somalis who think if a white person attacks them, it is their right because it is their country," he said. In addition, he said, they are often intimidated by police officers, whom they do not regard as sympathetic.
At the same time, he said, younger Asians, most of them second- or third-generation Britons, are more determined to fight back, and this increases the likelihood of violence.
On the Isle of Dogs, an area in East London where growing numbers of Bangladeshis and Somalis are being resettled in a mostly white public housing project, community workers say racial assaults occur daily.
In recent months, said Ms. Yahiya, who was assigned as the community's first racial harassment case worker in April, troublemakers have poured a bucket of water over the head of a 65-year-old Pakistani man as he was moving into an apartment in an all-white building, beaten up two Bengali men returning from a neighborhood civil rights forum, thrown a pig's head through the window of a local Muslim butcher, and so intimidated members of a Somali family that social agencies say they must relocate them.
Laila Hussein, who immigrated to London two years ago, said her younger brothers and sisters could not play outside their apartment building because some other residents in the mostly white complex had threatened to turn their dogs on them whenever they went outside. "We are all scared and want to leave," Ms. Hussein said.
In the last 25 years, according to Government population data, Britain's combined population of Asians and blacks has more than doubled, from 1.1 million to more than 2.7 million.
 
Most Nonwhites Are Asian
 Nearly 80 percent of those are Asians, including people from the Indian subcontinent, Korea, Southeast Asia and the Philippines. Blacks, who began moving to Britain in large numbers during the 1950's, are mostly immigrants from the West Indies and their descendants.
All together, nonwhites currently make up about 4.9 percent of the overall population of 55.8 million, compared with 2.1 percent in 1966.
While racial attacks involve whites against blacks and, less commonly, assaults by blacks on whites, the greatest increase in recent years has involved assaults by whites, and sometimes blacks, on Asians, the police and civil rights groups say.
Killings are relatively rare. The most highly publicized incident before the attack on Mr. Aramesh was the death two years ago of a 15-year-old black schoolboy, who was killed during a confrontation between white and black youths in Thamesmead, east of London. His 19-year-old assailant was convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment.
 
Woman Set Afire
 But this year, there have been several especially violent episodes, including an incident in which an Asian woman waiting for a bus in Ilford, in East London, was set afire by a group that included at least one black and one white teen-ager. She suffered burns over 20 percent of her body.
Superintendent John Jones, a London homicide detective, said that while racism was a clear factor in many of these violent crimes, the heart of the problem "is not color but culture."
"Basically, the people who cause these incidents are half-witted thugs, the same sorts of yobos who beat up people in pubs for no reason at all, or run amok at football stadiums," he said. "For them, a different skin color is just one more reason to pick a fight and beat someone up, and sometimes it gets badly out of hand."

HEADLINE: Trade Gap Narrows Modestly

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 19

 BODY:
The nation's persistent trade deficit showed scant improvement in June, narrowing only slightly to $6.59 billion as both exports and imports hit record highs, the Commerce Department said today.
The Bush Administration was quick to greet the report -- which showed exports of $38.28 billion, a 7.2 percent increase from May's level -- as a sign of renewed economic strength in the United States. "President Bush's leadership and experience in promoting America abroad is paying off in dividends for us at home -- in the form of jobs and economic growth," Commerce Secretary Barbara H. Franklin said in a statement.
 
Criticism by Democrats
 But as Democrats were quick to point out, the gain in exports was balanced by a 4.7 percent increase in imports, to $44.88 billion, and the overall trade deficit remains far above its level last winter and most of last year. "In the first few months of this year, it looked like significant progress was being made, but that has gone out the window now," said Representative Robert T. Matsui, a California Democrat on the House Subcommittee on Trade. 
 Recent monthly deficits suggest that the trade deficit for all of 1992 could reach $80 billion, up from $65.40 billion last year, Mr. Matsui noted.
But even an $80 billion deficit would still be smaller than the trade deficits of the late 1980's, which peaked at $152.12 billion in 1987.
 
Seasonal Adjustments
 American trade deficits with many regions widened in June, while the overall trade deficit narrowed. The reason is that the overall deficit is adjusted to account for seasonal fluctuations while bilateral deficits are not.
Remove the seasonal adjustment and the trade deficit in June, at $6.48 billion, was the worst since October of last year, according to Commerce Department figures released today.
Trade experts were surprised by the record exports and imports in June. Foreign markets for American products are weak while American economic growth, which tends to determine imports, has been slow, said Robert D. Hormats, a deputy United States trade representative in the Carter Administration who is now a vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International.
"In a way, the numbers don't square with what's happening in the real economy," he said.
Harold B. Malmgren, a former special trade representative in the Nixon and Ford Administrations, said that the increase in exports might prove more lasting because it reflected a long, slow decline in the value of the dollar, which has made American goods cheaper for foreign buyers.
During the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year, the monthly trade deficits bobbed up and down in a tight range between $3.29 billion and $5.87 billion. The deficit leaped to $7.06 billion in April and $7.14 billion in May for two reasons: recessions in Western European countries shrank their demand for American goods, while commercial aircraft deliveries sagged as the Boeing Company filled domestic orders. The increase in aircraft exports during June was twice as large as the narrowing of the overall deficit.
 
European Shortfall
 Exports to Western Europe fell again in June while imports increased, as the United States posted a deficit with the region of $89.9 million after a surplus of $966.4 million in May.
Imports from Mexico grew slightly faster than sales of American goods there, so that the nation's trade surplus with Mexico narrowed to $334.2 million, from $434.4 million in May. Mexico, Canada and the United States agreed last week to create a North American free trade area, although the legislatures of all three countries still must approve the pact.
But exports to Japan, after stagnating for the last year, did jump, to $4.16 billion, from $3.66 billion in May. Imports from Japan also increased, but not quite as much, so that the bilateral trade deficit narrowed slightly to $3.39 billion.
Oil imports rose to $4.19 billion in June, the highest level in 17 months. The increase reflected slightly higher oil prices and the continuing decline in American production.

HEADLINE: REPUBLICANS IN HOUSTON: The Religious Right;
Many Delegates See an Immoral and Scary America

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Aug. 19

 BODY:
It wasn't just souvenirs, choirs, country bands or even Pat Buchanan that drew Karen S. Johnson, Shirley Whitlock and hundreds of other religious conservatives to Houston this week. It was the hermetically sealed moral fiber of the Astrodome. "Everywhere I go there are like-minded people," Mrs. Johnson said. "That's so nice."
The two delegates who came to the Republican National Convention committed to Patrick J. Buchanan have limited exposure to the unlike-minded where they live: Mesa, Ariz., a quiet, conservative town with many mobile retirement homes and Christian churches. 
 And yet, sounding a little like someone who has made it through a primeval forest in search of other walled cities, Mrs. Whitlock explained, "It's so nice to know there are other people in other states like us."
 
Inside Information
 In Mrs. Whitlock's mind, the world outside the Astrodome is a rather menacing place, where even the P.T.A., the library and the school nurse cannot be completely trusted, and where news organizations censor the news. "Here, you get inside information," Mrs. Whitlock said, referring to juicy gossip about Gov. Bill Clinton, the Democratic arch-rival, that she heard from an Arkansas delegate in the ladies' room.
The views of Mrs. Whitlock and her "like-minded people" on the Republican right flank have dominated their party's convention and platform. Tonight's theme, "family values," is close to their heart. For them it is more than an election-year campaign slogan; it is the password that signals which side they stand on in the religious and cultural war that their candidate, Mr. Buchanan, outlined in his speech Monday night.
The network of politically active religious Republicans that helped another conservative candidate, Ronald Reagan, triumph over the moderate George Bush in the 1980 primaries still rules the convention floor in 1992. Leaders like the television evangelists Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson are not as conspicuous this year, but they do not need to be.
In interviews with members of this crusade this week, the term "family values" unleashed talk of unfairness, of being surrounded, ignored and even persecuted. Whether it was Mrs. Whitlock, a member of Phyllis Schlafly's Eagle Forum and a Mormon with eight children and 28 grandchildren, or Richard J. Rapaport, a middle-aged Jewish painter from New York City, they expressed strong philosophical views about church, taxes, welfare, homosexuality and the breakdown of the family.
But almost all of them could also pinpoint a more direct, personal grievance. For Mrs. Whitlock, it was the Judy Blume series of books for girls. For Mr. Rapaport, it was the Whitney Museum.
 
Patriotic Art
 Mr. Rapaport is fighting for recognition for his art. He had a patriotic art display, "Let Freedom Ring," set up amid stands selling T-shirts, novelties and hot dogs in the exhibition hall next to the Astrodome.
A Syracuse graduate who works in his family's construction business by day, Mr. Rapaport described his paintings of brightly colored flags and eagles as "a new moral vision" to combat "this disorder." But he said gallery owners and curators were only interested in "subway graffiti artists and minorities."
"I sent a hundred letters to people in the art world," Mr. Rapaport said. He said had he contacted the Whitney museum so often that a curator finally gave him some advice. "The Whitney guy told me the art world wouldn't touch my work," Mr. Rapaport said, "because I showed the love of America."
He said he did get a positive review when he sent his art to Washington. "The White House wrote me," he said. "They thought it was beautiful."
 
Distrust of Schools
 Mrs. Whitlock has also carried on a long struggle, hers with local school and community officials. With her encouragement, two of Mrs. Whitlock's daughters have taken their children out of the public school system and placed them in "home school," out of range of sex education, the National Education Association and librarians that recommend books that Mrs. Whitlock considers "shocking."
The popular Judy Blume books for pre-adolescent girls are particularly galling to Mrs. Whitlock. "I mean, there are unwed mothers who have affairs," Mrs. Whitlock said. "It's for little girls, and it promotes the idea that its O.K. to have sex outside of marriage."
A liberal consensus of left-leaning teachers, Democrats and "media types," Mrs. Whitlock said, censor "anything that is pro-Christian and traditional." Citing figures she said she read in Family and America magazine, Mrs. Whitlock said that because the personal income tax exemption had not kept pace with inflation, the tax laws have been unfair to "traditional families where the wife stays home."
Mrs. Whitlock said she knew the reason. "Because of an unwarranted fear of a population boom, they wanted mothers out of the home and working to reduce the size of the family," she said. "They" are the Federal Government, and she felt personally victimized. Because she wanted to stay home, her husband, a state parole officer, was forced to take a night job cleaning offices. She said only "Judeo-Christian principles" could get the country back on track.
 
'Hoity-Toity People'
 Matt Stephens, a 42-year-old country music disk jockey from Nashville, said he had "never mixed with this many hoity-toity people in my life."
Asked about family values, Mr. Stephens mentioned welfare. "I'm not a rich guy," he said, "and I feel there is something wrong about giving someone something for nothing."
Walter Costello, 28, a delegate from Tucson, Ariz., said family values were a matter of example more than law. "You can't legislate morality," he said. "It has to be done in the personal lives of our leaders. If our politicians don't discriminate, if they don't skirt-chase, if they don't harass, if they show respect for their wives and daughters, and the same thing happens in the entertainment and business community, then you'd have a social revolution."
For some delegates, though, the fervor over values was a bit bewildering. "I don't really understand what family values are," said Norman Hildreth, a retired insurance salesman from Oak Ridge, Tenn. "I raised three children and tried to teach them to do the right thing. Is that it?"

HEADLINE: Stocks in Late Drop; Dow Falls by 22.42

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The stock market tumbled in the last hour of trading yesterday, pulled down in part by bank stocks and home-building shares.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 22.42 points, to 3,307.06. 
Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Volume on the Big Board came to 187.1 million shares, up from 171.8 million in the previous session.
Until the late afternoon, the market was relatively quiet and directionless on the eve of President Bush's speech before the Republican convention in Houston. Shares then dropped sharply, ending near the day's lows.
Bank stocks, which were heavily traded, helped drag down the market, said Hugh Johnson, senior vice president with the First Albany Corporation. Citicorp fell 1 1/8, to 16 3/4; Chemical Banking dropped 1 3/8, to 32 3/4, and Chase Manhattan dropped 1 1/2, to 22 5/8.
The selling in bank shares was accelerated by a wide rumor that the nation's largest mutual fund, Fidelity Investments of Boston, was selling Citicorp and other major bank stocks, traders said.
Paula Slotkin, Fidelity spokeswoman, denied the rumor.
 
Starting a Fire
 John Heffern, bank analyst for Alex. Brown & Sons, compared the Fidelity rumor to a spark that starts a brush fire.
Generally speaking, Mr. Heffern said, stock traders are nervous about any corporation with overvalued stock in a sluggish economy. Bank stocks have been rallying for two years.
Home-building stocks also contributed to the slide, dropping after the Kaufman & Broad Home Corporation said its third-quarter profit would be lower. The single-family home builder was down 2 1/2, at 11 3/4, while Standard Pacific fell 1/2, to 5 7/8.
On Tuesday, the Commerce Department reported that United United housing starts fell a worse-than-expected 2.8 percent in July.
Investors appeared to shrug off gains overnight in foreign stock prices. In Tokyo, stocks rebounded from a six-year low, while London shares also rose.
The market similarly seemed to ignore good news on the economic front. The Commerce Department said yesterday that the United States trade deficit shrank 7.7 percent, to $6.59 billion in June. Sales of American goods overseas set a new record.
Among other actively traded Big Board issues, Sunbeam-Oster, the consumer goods maker, ended unchanged at 12 1/2 after an initial offering of 20 million shares of common stock was priced at $12.50 a share.
Syntex fell 1 1/8, to 29 1/8, after a market survey showed disappointing prescription performance for oral Toradol, the drug company's new nonnarcotic pain-reliever.
Among blue chips, International Business Machines fell 1 3/8, to 86 5/8; Disney fell 1 3/8, to 34 1/2, after an analyst initiated coverage of the company's Euro Disney affiliate with a "sell" rating, and Bristol-Myers Squibb fell 1, to 69.
The New York Stock Exchange's composite index fell 1.49, to 230.41. On the American Stock Exchange, the market value index lost 0.92, to 385.89. The Nasdaq index fell 3.26, to 567.61.

HEADLINE: Fashion Advertisers' Record On Minorities Is Denounced

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
Some of America's most prestigious marketers of expensive fashion, beauty and cosmetic products, like Calvin Klein and Estee Lauder, were attacked yesterday for limiting or omitting members of minorities from their magazine advertisements.
Other marketers also came under fire, but for using members of minorities in what were deemed stereotypical roles. That judgment is likely to be questioned by those who believe appearances by minority athletes and musicians is a positive development. 
 The castigations came from Mark Green, the Commissioner of the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs, who issued a study, "Still Invisible," that surveyed 2,108 ads in 10 magazines, from Better Homes and Gardens to Vogue. The study updated a much publicized report, "Invisible People," released 13 months ago, which found blacks in only 3.4 percent of national magazine ads and 4.6 percent of mail-order catalogues.
 
Letters to 14 Companies
 "I'm appealing to corporate advertisers to act in their own economic interest as well as in the public interest," Mr. Green said in a statement, "by including more people of color in their ads."
Mr. Green, an activist commissioner who broadly interprets his mandate to regulate consumer affairs, said that he had written letters to the 14 companies singled out as having the fewest minorities in their ads. Among them were Calvin Klein, zero out of 156 ads; Estee Lauder, zero out of 114; Cover Girl, 1 out of 226, and Ralph Lauren, 4 out of 138.
A spokeswoman for the Estee Lauder Companies in New York said that for its Estee Lauder line, it has been the company's approach to "have one model under exclusive contract as a component of our global trademark." Currently, the model is Paulina Porizkova.
"We think her beauty is quite universal," the spokeswoman added. She said that for All Skins, a line of cosmetics marketed by the Prescriptives line, ads depict "diverse models," including black women.
 
Rebuttal from Ralph Lauren
 A spokeswoman for the Polo/Ralph Lauren Corporation in New York said, "We have prominently featured minorities in our advertising for many years and we plan to continue to do so."
A spokeswoman at Grey Advertising in New York, the agency for Cover Girl cosmetics, did not return a telephone call seeking comment. The trade publication Adweek has reported, however, that Cover Girl has been seeking "a black supermodel" to serve as a spokeswoman for new Cover Girl products for black women.
A spokeswoman for Calvin Klein said that Mr. Klein was on vacation and could not be reached for comment.
Though it concluded that appearances by members of minorities in magazine ads rose to 5.2 percent, the study played down the increase by arguing that many of the additional models appeared in stereotypical roles. For instance, Mr. Green noted that members of minorities appeared in 24 of Toyota's 135 ads. But he complained that one of the ads prominently featured a black person used in the stereotypical role of an athlete; the individual was the basketball player Isiah Thomas.
Many advertising and marketing executives, both black and white, have applauded the inclusion of black celebrities among the nation's roster of star endorsers.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: The Democrats;
Clinton Assails G.O.P. Attacks Aimed at Wife

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark,. Aug. 19

 BODY:
Gov. Bill Clinton, the Democratic Presidential nominee, offered a stinging criticism of President Bush and the Republican Party today, saying their attacks on his wife were an effort to demonize her just as they used the Willie Horton story to depict Michael S. Dukakis as soft on crime.
"What they're trying to do is kind of make it a Willie Horton thing against all independent working women, trying to run against them in a way that I think is really lamentable," he said. 
 Mr. Clinton, after a day of campaigning in Atlanta with former President Jimmy Carter, assailed the attacks on his wife, Hillary. "This party, this Republican Party has obviously been taken over by the extreme, intolerant right wing of the party," he said. "You look at who has been featured. It's the Pat Robertson, Pat Buchanan, Jerry Falwell, Phyllis Schlafly wing of the party. They control it now. They've got George Bush right where they want him."
Mr. Clinton said that by attacking his wife the Republicans were seeking to portray all working women in negatively. By doing so, he said, the Republicans were trying to turn Mrs. Clinton into a caricature of a woman who would choose a career over her family.
 
Diversionary Tactic Is Seen
 Mrs. Clinton, who traveled with her husband to Atlanta for an appearance with Mr. Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, declined to comment on her husband's remarks.
Mr. Clinton said the Bush campaign's attacks on Mrs. Clinton were beside the point and meant to distract voters from the real choice between the candidates for President. "For Bush to attack Hillary is ridiculous," he said. "You'd think he was running for First Lady instead of for President. I just don't think it will be very persuasive."
Torie Clarke, the spokeswoman for the Bush campaign, said in a telephone interview that the differences between the two campaigns is a matter of values, not personalities.
"I think she's made some very strong statements and obviously has some strongly held opinions," Ms. Clarke said about Mrs. Clinton. "And what you see sometimes is people expressing their opinions in response. But Hillary Clinton is not the issue in this race. It's George Bush versus Bill Clinton."
She said it was insulting to suggest that criticism of Mrs. Clinton could be translated into an attack on all working women.
 
Defense Is First Order
 Mr. Clinton turned every question he received this afternoon into an opportunity to defend his wife against the attacks that have been directed at her by Mr. Buchanan and others.
Mr. Buchanan, the former conservative commentator who unsuccessfully challenged Mr. Bush for the Republican nomination in the early primaries, said in a convention speech Monday night that Mrs. Clinton represented "radical feminism."
Barbara Bush, in an interview on Tuesday, said she understood that Mr. and Mrs. Clinton have planned a "co-Presidency," a charge Mr. Clinton insisted he has never even mentioned.
"They know this is a load of bull," Mr. Clinton said, who added that both President and Mrs. Bush have praised Mrs. Clinton's work on behalf of children's issues. "But they've given themselves over to the right-wing extremists in their party." he said. "And they don't have a record or a vision, so they're going to run whatever they can. And I think American people are really going to react against it.
"It shows the panic and the lack of vision and commitment and real character in the whole Republican campaign."
Mr. Clinton said today that all the Republican attacks have been "about Hillary," but convention speakers have also lobbed direct shots at Mr. Clinton as well, asserting that he would raise taxes, "disarm America" and propose an economic plan that would require extensive new spending.
"I'm a little surprised that they resorted to the attacks on Hillary they have, and that they have done it in a way that required them to falsify and grossly distort her own records and words," Mr. Clinton said. "These people get away with murder because nobody ever stands up to them."
But standing up to the attacks of their opponents is a strategy that the Clinton campaign takes great pride in. Today, for instance, the Democrat's Little Rock headquarters released a two-page press statement called the "Republican Lie Meter," in which the campaign took issue with statements made at the Houston convention.
Mr. Clinton spent the morning helping Mr. Carter build a low-income house being developed by Habitat for Humanity in Atlanta. He turned to the attack on the Republicans this afternoon as he headed back to Little Rock.
"What they've done at this convention is just the 1992 version of what they know how to do," he said. "Slash and burn. Trash your opponent. Try to make them look crazy. And I just think the American people will see through it."
Mr. Clinton also said that Mr. Bush's comments that he would revamp his cabinet in his second term was "a stunning acknowledgement of failure in the first term."
 
Celebrating 46th Birthday
 Earlier in the day, Mr. Clinton struck a more high-minded tone as he celebrated his 46th birthday with his wife and daughter and with his running mate, Senator Al Gore, his wife, Tipper, and their four children. Mrs. Gore. who shares a birthday with Mr. Clinton, was 44 years old today.
"We thought it would be a good day to spend the day building and not tearing down," Mr. Clinton said at a break from four hours of construction work.
Mr. Carter, who said he had been reading about, but not watching, the Republican convention, said the Republicans have spent more time on the attack than in talking about needs like housing.
"I haven't heard much discussion at the Republican convention about what will be done for low-income families, working families of America," Mr. Carter said.

HEADLINE: A DELICATE BALANCE: Battle for Texas;
Crippled by Economy, Texas Is Up for Grabs

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Aug. 19

 BODY:
Just 19 months ago, when the Republicans announced they would hold their convention here, President Bush seemed to have a lock on Texas. A little more than a month ago Mr. Perot seemed primed to take the state. Now, even some of Mr. Bush's most prominent supporters say he is fighting for his survival in the state that is the birthplace of his political career.
The political landscape in Texas has long favored Republicans at the top of the ticket. But the electoral terrain has been shifting in recent years, and now both he and Gov. Bill Clinton must clamber across uncertain ground. 
 In the suburbs, Ross Perot exercised a mighty appeal over the state's white, middle-class voters and these notorious ticket-splitters are up for grabs now that he's gone. In the Piney Woods of East Texas and out on the staked plains of West Texas, oil drilling is down to levels not seen in a generation, and the blame is being leveled, not at the economy, but at the policy-makers of both parties in Washington.
And in the dusty small towns of South Texas and in crowded urban neighborhoods, Hispanic and black voters are eager for a chance to exercise the clout that has come with their population growth.
 
Cavalry to the Rescue
 Senator Phil Gramm, the state's top Republican office holder, likened the campaign here to a group of pioneers under attack by hostile Indians. "We've got to pull out our sabers, spur our horses and head out for the wagon train and hope we get there on time," he said in an interview with ABC News. "I believe we're going to."
Not since the Democrats had a native Texan, Lyndon B. Johnson, at the top of the ticket has a Republican Presidential candidate faced such difficulties in Texas.
"The Republican tide may have run as far as its going to go here, in fact it may already be running out," said John Connally, a popular Democratic Governor in the 1960's who then switched parties.
When Mr. Bush first entered politics here in the 1950's, "Yellow dog Democrats," so-named because they liked to say they would vote for an ugly beast before voting for a Republican, had ruled the state as a one-party fief since Reconstruction. The first cracks came when Texas went for Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952, eight years before a Republican won any statewide office. Then, along with California and Florida, it became part of the Sun Belt triad that helped keep Republicans in the White House for 20 of the last 24 years.
 
Home of the Ticket-Splitters
 With public opinion polls showing Mr. Bush just as far behind in his home state as he is in the rest of the country, some officials of both parties wonder if they are witnessing another fundamental change in Texas politics.
Kent Hance, an alternate in the Texas delegation who is a former Democrat himself, said he believed the Republicans would hold their advantage even if they did not expand on it. He said, "So many voters have come over to our side in Presidential elections that the shift could have slowed, maybe it's peaked."
George Christian, a White House official in the Johnson Administration who is a Democratic political consultant in Austin, said: "This has become such a ticket-splitting state that we've had some pretty strange elections recently. But this year the fundamentals look better for the Democrats than they have at any time since 1976 at least."
Already this year the allegiances of Texas voters have been teased and tested. Both major-party candidates and Mr. Perot are all familiar figures here, and each has his own, sometimes overlapping, constituencies.
 
One Issue: the Economy
 The economy, such a potent political motivator elsewhere, exercises a particularly profound influence here. While the rest of the nation is responding to a sharp downturn after a long period of prosperity, Texans had just begun to enjoy a recovery from the oil busts of the 1980's when things went flat.
"In the past we've had Presidential campaigns turn on all kinds of ideological and emotional issues, but this one is very fundamentally a campaign of pocketbook issues," Mr. Connally said. "Things may be worse other places right now, but we Texans went through one hell of a ringer." After their long experience of economic pain, he said, Texans are likely to be skeptical of Republicans' claims that they are the party of prosperity.
A key demographic factor in the success of previous Republican candidates has been the large number of independents and Republicans who moved to the suburbs of Texas cities during the oil boom of the 1970's and early 1980's. "This tremendous migration overwhelmingly benefited the Republicans," said Richard Murray, a professor of Political Science at the University of Houston, but he noted that by the late 1980's this movement slowed considerably and even stopped in some places because of the economic problems here.
In 1990, Ann W. Richards narrowly won the race for Governor using a novel strategy for a Democrat that included aggressively seeking suburban votes. "We realized that the Republicans had so eroded the traditional Democratic base that we had to target the swing voters," said Mary Beth Rogers, the Governor's chief of staff. She noted that the Richards campaign went after suburban voters with promises to improve the regulation of insurance companies and that Mr. Clinton was striking similar cords with his emphasis on a national health insurance program.
Gary Mauro, chairman of the Clinton campaign in Texas, said, "Richards changed the landscape when she carried the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, and now we are now definitely going after the suburban voters."
And the battle for the white, middle class has been inflamed by the peculiarities of this election season.
"We have a real problem in the suburbs because Perot made it possible for those people to say they are not for Bush," said a Texas Republican delegate here speaking on condition of anonymity. "Now they are loose and we have to get them back in the corral before Clinton gets them."
Mr. Clinton has already aggressively courted Hispanic voters, the fastest growing sector of the Texas electorate. Robert Stein, a professor of political science at Rice University in Houston, said poll results show "Clinton has locked the Hispanic vote and locked it early. If he can hold his margins in this community he'll be competitive in Texas."
Like a political frontiersman, Mr. Bush came to Texas when the Republican Party barely existed here, and he has helped build it for nearly 40 years. As a result, he enjoys advantages in personal associations and in fund-raising abilities even beyond those normally bestowed on an incumbent President. History was on his side when he returned to Houston this week, but he cannot afford to take anything for granted.
"We have never just won this state," said Karl Rove, a Republican consultant and alternate on the Texas delegation. "We have to go out and earn it, and this time we can't concede anything or assume anything."

Triumvirate Shapes Bush Acceptance Speech

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Aug. 19

 BODY:
If President Bush assumes blame or credit for his convention speech Thursday night, responsibility for its language falls mostly to a triumvirate of friends and aides, led by a man who once crafted sound bites for Richard M. Nixon.
He is Raymond Kissam Price Jr., a 62-year-old former newspaper editor who is one of Mr. Bush's old friends and political kibitzers. Among the cognoscenti, Mr. Price is an acknowledged master of the sweeping, uplifting political speech, and the aides say that is the sort of address the President will try to deliver: broad, thematic and generally optimistic in a campaign that so far has had its share of dark moments. 
 Mr. Price has found rainbows in hurricanes before. He first drew public attention in the 1968 campaign, when he coined the phrase "the lift of a driving dream" for speeches that carried Mr. Nixon to the White House.
Mr. Nixon named him chief White House speechwriter in 1970, and Mr. Price later constructed most of the President's Watergate speeches, including the resignation address on Aug. 8, 1974, when Mr. Nixon urged the nation "to put the bitterness and divisions of the recent past behind us."
Mr. Price has not been visibly active in Republican politics since then, but Mr. Bush's decision to make him the chief architect of his acceptance speech is not a surprise.
"He's a friend of the President, and he's talked to him about some ideas he had for the campaign, off and on, for a long time," Mr. Bush's campaign chairman and day-to-day manager, Robert M. Teeter, said in an interview. "He sent him notes and memos, and the President agreed with a lot of it. And when the time came to choose someone for the speech it was logical to turn to him."
The two men's lives and political philosophies have run similar courses. Six years younger than Mr. Bush, Mr. Price graduated from Yale University, Mr. Bush's alma mater, in 1951, and like the President is a member of the secret Yale honor society Skull and Bones.
In 1950 he worked in the first Senate campaign of the President's father, Prescott Bush, a Republican from Connecticut. From 1964 to 1966, Mr. Price was editorial page editor of The New York Herald Tribune.
In structure and theme, the President's acceptance speech is largely Mr. Price's, Bush aides say. But they also say it has been worked over by two Administration officials, Steve Provost and Robert B. Zoellick.
Mr. Zoellick, now Under Secretary of State for economic affairs, is proxy for Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, who will move to the White House as chief of staff next week.
Mr. Provost (pronounced PRO-voh) is the latest in a parade of chief speechwriters in the Bush White House.

HEADLINE: Businesslike With Business's Help, Cincinnati Schools Shake Off Crisis

BYLINE: By WILLIAM CELIS 3d, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CINCINNATI

 BODY:
A year ago, the Cincinnati public school system was, in the words of its superintendent, a system in crisis.
Four in 10 students never graduated from high school. Management and cost controls were weak, contributing to the district's crippling $76 million debt. Public confidence had so eroded that in November 1990 voters rejected a tax levy. The district slipped into state receivership, a form of bankruptcy for public agencies. 
 Something had to be done, but the school system's leaders didn't want to lay off teachers. Aided by local businesses, they devised an overhaul plan that draws heavily from the lessons learned by corporate America's own wrenching restructuring of the 1980's; it called for the district to trim its administrative staff by half, along with taking a variety of other steps to restore quality and improve morale.
The Cincinnati effort has been called a test case in engaging businesses in school restructuring, as well as a test of how far so-called bureaucratic bloat can be reduced.
 
How to Involve Business
 "No school district has come close to this magnitude of change," said Chris Pipho, director of state relations for the Education Commission of the States, a Denver-based education policy and research organization. "It's a good model in that it shows how to involve business in systemic reform."
Systemic reform was necessary, said the superintendent of schools, J. Michael Brandt. "The district was in turmoil," he said. "We needed to improve efficiencies, and we needed to restore confidence." So widespread was the feeling that the schools were a disgrace that the overhaul met virtually no political opposition.
Under the restructuring plan written by the Cincinnati Business Committee, an organization of local corporations, the district has reduced its administration by 65 positions, or 51 percent of the original total of 127 jobs. The reduction will result in a $16 million savings during the next two years that will be diverted to classrooms, for staff, supplies and other needs.
Principals, teachers and parents will be given more control over daily operations. This underpins the decision to cut 65 administrative positions; the layoffs came not from clerical or support staff but from supervisory positions in such areas as curriculum development, special education, vocational education and planning and development. Three "area offices," subsidiaries of the main district office each headed by an assistant superintendent, were completely eliminated.
 
Incentive-Pay Plan
 The district is also working on an incentive-pay plan designed to keep veteran teachers in inner-city schools, which in this and other systems have traditionally been staffed by newer, less experienced teachers. Of the 51,000 students, 57 percent are poor enough to qualify for the Federal free or reduced-price lunch program.
The report, which was adopted last year by the school district, also called for the creation of nine mini-districts, one of which was granted waivers from most state regulations for five years so it can experiment with new approaches. Successful programs it develops will then be replicated in other mini-districts.
This fall, for example, the pilot mini-district, which has five elementary schools, one middle school and a high school, will offer day-care centers for students with children to encourage young mothers to stay in school.
The district's bumpy ride to restructuring began in 1990, when the former Superintendent of Schools, Lee Etta Powell, commissioned the Cincinnati Business Committee to seek ways to improve schools. She resigned in the summer of 1991, leaving Mr. Brandt to sell the changes to the public: If you support the effort and approve a November 1991 tax increase, the new superintendent told voters, the district will follow the corporate recommendations.
 
Emergency Taxes Approved
 Voters did approve the five-year emergency tax increase last fall, an increase that raised the average homeowner's tax bill by about $197 a year. But the $46 million it will generate each year has given the district more financial breathing room: It was removed from receivership after state officials allowed the district to pay back its $76 million in debt over 10 years instead of two as required by state law.
Chief among the changes at the administrative level is a bottom-to-top chain of command that many companies adopted in the 1980's to improve efficiency and give workers more of a stake in the operation. For businesses -- which have long debated among themselves and with educators what role companies could play in the school restructuring movement -- the Cincinnati plan has given them more clarity about their place.
"We can show schools how to be more efficient because we had to do the same thing in the 1980's," said Robert L. Wehling, vice president for public affairs at Procter & Gamble and a member of the National Business Roundtable's Education Task Force. "Unlike schools, which can give 'C' grades and everyone continues, in business if you fall behind people lose jobs, you have to close plants."
 
Free Consultations
 Beyond the report, businesses will remain involved in the district's efforts by offering support staff and consultants free of charge, services that school officials say would ordinarily cost them millions of dollars a year.
Teachers have endorsed the plan, saying they have clamored for many of these changes for years. Their challenge, several teachers said, is to believe the administration when it says that change will occur and that teachers will be major players.
"I welcome the change," said Diana Porter, a high school teacher in the pilot mini-district that will experiment with innovation. "The issue that some teachers still face is trust."
To insure that its teachers are up to the task, the pilot mini-district has held training sessions on how to participate in school-based management, how to teach students differently and how to better relate to parents.
Mrs. Porter, who is one of the lead teachers in the pilot mini-district that received waivers from state regulations, said that changes are still being discussed but that already teachers in that mini-district have decided to experiment with two-hour class periods. That, Mrs. Porter said, has prompted brain-storming sessions on how a teacher instructs differently to students in such classes.
During one recent training session, parents told teachers not to sell their children short. Six in 10 of the city's public school students are black, and some black parents asserted that teachers in the past have stigmatized their youngsters because of their color or socio-economic background.
"I don't want you to think that a child can't learn because of his financial background or neighborhood," said Carol Wallace, a parent with a son in the local schools. "Demand excellence from them."
Another parent, Gloria McGee, who is single and raising two sons, said that in the past teachers had given short shrift to youngsters from single-parent homes. "Sometimes I am working and can't be at school," she said. "That doesn't mean I don't care. You have to be nurturers, and we have to be teachers at home."

HEADLINE: Dinkins Administration Feud Shows Strain of Dealing With Homeless

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
The warning by New York City's Housing Authority that it cannot keep setting aside 2,000 apartments a year for homeless families without jeopardizing the stability of its projects has once again revealed sharp disputes and poor coordination inside the Dinkins administration over how to handle the homeless, an issue it has studied to death.
At the heart of the fight is a philosophical divide over whether homeless people mostly need a house -- simply bricks and mortar -- or are suffering from a complex mesh of social and health problems that only intensive services, training and monitoring can solve. 
 Mayor David N. Dinkins, who made compassion for the homeless a centerpiece of his campaign three years ago, has found it difficult to choose between those two strains of thought or to provide enough of either -- housing or services.
Even his most recent efforts to come up with a long-range approach for dealing with the homeless left an ambiguous message: When his blue-ribbon panel headed by Andrew Cuomo recommended this spring that the city create a new agency and a network of special centers for the homeless, Mr. Dinkins farmed out many recommendations for up to two years of further study, which would put off controversial decisions until after next year's mayoral election.
Without decisions from the top, different parts of Mr. Dinkins's administration have followed different drummers and fallen to fighting. One of the clearest examples came this week when the Housing Authority said it would reduce the number of homeless it took because they had brought crime and other problems, and officials in the Human Resources Administration argued there was little evidence of that and said the authority should keep taking homeless families.
 
'The Perception'
 The feud was brought into the open by one of Mr. Dinkins's longtime aides, Sally B. Hernandez-Pinero, who took over as head of the Federally financed Housing Authority this spring. She said the projects can no longer absorb what amounts to nearly half of the 4,500 homeless families the city moves into permanent housing each year without upsetting the delicate balance of poor and working-class families that has made the projects a national success. She called for tighter screening and better services to help homeless families.
Her public plea -- and a public reply from other senior officials that she would most certainly keep taking homeless families, the only question being how many -- simply pointed out the longstanding gridlock in the administration on such tough issues, and left City Hall scrambling to put the best face on a problem that has been brewing for months.
"One thing is certain," the deputy mayor for health and human services, Cesar A. Perales, said yesterday. "There is a perception in many housing developments that crime and drugs are the result of families that were formerly homeless being placed there. We can debate whether it is based on fact or whether we have a new scapegoat, but I think we have to address the perception as much as the substance by providing more services to families who need them."
Just what that will involve is unclear. Mr. Perales said the city was circulating a request for proposals from nonprofit organizations to create a $5 million pilot program to screen and offer services to homeless families who move into permanent housing. But that is a drop in the bucket. The administration's larger efforts to build a network of "transitional housing" to provide just such services remains stalled.
"If Ed Koch was abdicating responsibility for dealing with this problem in the way that David Dinkins has, David Dinkins would have been the first to excoriate him," said Steve Banks of the Legal Aid Society's Homeless Family Rights Project.
 
Defending His Record
 Since taking office, Mr. Dinkins has steadily drawn the wrath of many advocates for the homeless, even as he has managed to make great strides lately in resolving other thorny, though perhaps less ideological, issues like the city budget and waste disposal
"Ultimately, the Mayor's just an extremely liberal person, and it's very hard for him to accept the notion that he's just going to have to limit homeless people from coming into the system," said one senior aide, speaking on condition of anonymity.
But yesterday, the Mayor defended his record.
"There are people who for one reason or another take a very secure political posture with respect to it," Mr. Dinkins said. "I don't have that luxury. I'm Mayor. I have got to deal in a responsible fashion and not take potshots from the sidelines."
Mr. Dinkins also rejected the notion that homeless people are necessarily criminals or drug abusers and said that catastrophic illness or sudden unemployment could wipe out the savings of a working family.
 
Priorities Changing
 "Boom! Homeless!" he said. "It doesn't mean they were people lacking in social graces or needing any special care, but they are homeless."
Housing Authority officials said they did not have definitive data on the effects of homeless people on the city's public-housing projects, which have strived for years to keep their tenants a mix of one-third each of the poor, the elderly and working families. But the number of poor families entering the system rose from about a third in 1985 to more than half last year, and officials said their entire component of very low income families is now composed of the homeless, displacing others who have been on the waiting list for years.
In 1988, the Housing Authority agreed to give priority to 2,000 homeless families a year, in part because of a Reagan Administration directive that gave preference in Federal projects to the homeless. But Dinkins administration officials complain bitterly that this was a poor substitute for more Federal money to build housing or provide social services.
Now the authority's ability to keep taking homeless families is also limited by the recent settlement of a lawsuit that alleged years of racial steering at 31 of the authority's 324 projects. As a result, 2,000 apartments will be set aside in those developments in coming years for people who can show they were victims of discrimination, reducing the number available for other purposes.
Mr. Perales said the administration was still weighing just how many homeless families the authority should take.
Mr. Banks of the Legal Aid Society said the administration should decide what to do and then do it.
"All this really presents a picture of a city that isn't very well run," he said.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Municipal Issues Are Weak Again

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The municipal bond market was weak again yesterday as a glut of new issues, brought on by the sharp drop in interest rates recently, left dealers with a lot of notes and bonds that were hard to pass on to investors.
Traders said that the long end of the market was unchanged to down as much as half a point. 
 "The municipal market has experienced a fairly dramatic selloff over the last two and a half weeks," said Stephen C. Leslie, senior vice president of trading at M. R. Beal & Company. "It had gotten a little bit ahead of itself."
Traders said that prices in the municipal market had moved up further -- and consequently, yields had dropped further -- than in the Treasury market since the current rally started in July. One measure of this is that the yields on municipal bonds had fallen to below 80 percent of those on comparable Treasury securities. When the ratio has fallen below 80 percent in the last four years the municipal market has stalled and fallen.
At the same time, the buildup of new municipal issues was growing. Traders now estimate that there is a total of $7 billion to $8 billion in new issues scheduled to be issued in 30 days.
One measure of the decline can be seen in the pricing of two similar issues on Tuesday and yesterday. The five-year portion of a $250 million issue of Illinois general-obligation bonds was priced to yield 4.60 percent on Tuesday. A similar State of Washington issue was priced yesterday to yield 4.65 percent, an increase of 5 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point.
But, at the same time, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico's sale of $538 million in bonds and variable-rate securities went rather well, according to Mr. Leslie of M. R. Beal, in part because the bonds are exempt from Federal, state and local taxes, which make it especially attractive to a lot of state pension funds.
 
The Treasury Market
 In the Treasury market, prices of bonds and notes were little changed or down in the morning but rallied to close up in the afternoon in thin trading.
Traders said demand from long-term investors was strong for 5- and 10-year notes. This demand also set off a rise in the price of the 30-year bond as speculators who has sold Tuesday or yesterday morning had to cover their positions as the buying of 5- and 10-year notes increased demand for the 30-year bond.
The 7.25 percent long bond was offered in late trading in the secondary market at 99 1/4, up 5/32 to yield 7.31 percent, reaching once again the five-and-a-half-year low touched a week ago.
Traders and investors continued to wait to see if developments at the Republican National Convention would upset the bond market. The White House announced that President Bush would outline steps to stimulate the economy in his acceptance speech tonight. If investors decided the President was going too far in pumping up the economy, which would increase the deficit and possibly stir inflationary fears, bond prices could fall.
The decline in the trade deficit for July, which gave an initial indication of a slightly stronger economy, sent the price of the 30-year bond down early in the day.
 
Trade Data Worry Some
 The decline in the trade deficit seemed to worry some traders because the rise in both exports and imports to record levels may indicate that the American economy is stronger than has been anticipated. The deficit fell 7.7 percent in June to $6.59 billion from a revised $7.14 billion in May.
But some economists, like Sally Kleinman of Chemical Securities Inc, think that the numbers are not as positive as they appear. She cited several reasons for this interpretation.
One is that the data are not adjusted for the number of selling days in a month. And there were 22 in June, compared with 20 in May. So there were two more days for imports and exports to be counted.
In addition, she said that with a rise of six-tenths of 1 percent in trade and manufacturing inventories in June, a lot of the imports have ended up on the shelf. This means that the demand from from the consumer is not as strong as the import rise might imply.
She also said that more than 40 percent of the increase in American exports was in sales of civilian aircraft, which is a pace that is not likely to continue.
The Treasury announced it would auction $10.5 billion of five-year notes and $15 billion of two-year notes next week. In the pre-auction, or when-issued, market the five-year note was trading at a yield of 5.44 percent and the two-year note at a yield of 4.07 percent, both higher than the yields on the current notes.

HEADLINE: Trade Pact May Intensify Problems at the Border

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EL PASO

 BODY:
The new North American Free Trade Agreement, once ratified, will clearly increase the already frenetic business activity carried out on the Mexican border. But it will also turn up the environmental, health and social pressures that have all but overwhelmed border communities.
As it is, sanitation and housing conditions are extremely bad in much of the region here where El Paso and Juarez, Mexico face one another across the Rio Grande. Hepatitis, for example, is endemic. Cholera bacteria have been detected in recent weeks just across the border in Juarez's waste water, and health authorities in both countries are rushing to prevent an outbreak of the deadly disease. 
 The Mexican Government has pledged to spend more than $450 million in the next three years on environmental and health programs along its 2,000-mile border with the United States, including waste-water treatment plants.
And the United States has earmarked $201 million for border cleanup in 1993.
But many environmental advocates say neither country is coming to grips with the accumulated problems. They say the Mexican Government is too committed to economic development to devote resources to enforce its environmental laws.
 
Different Social Agendas
 "The Mexican Government has a different social agenda than we do," said John Audley, an official of the Sierra Club who has worked on the United States-Mexican border. "They would like to have economic growth and a clean environment, but economic growth is first." Mexican officials deny the accusation, citing the country's $450 million commitment as proof.
The border areas' problems stem in large measure from rapid population growth.
The semi-free trade and huge cross-border traffic that currently link El Paso and its sister city across the Rio Grande, Ciudad Juarez, have doubled the region's population to about two million in two decades.
As the treaty is put into place, growth will inevitably accelerate. American manufacturers will be lured south for the inexpensive Mexican labor and workers will come toward the border for the new jobs.
Large populations require large, complicated services. But sewage produced in Juarez now flows untreated into a ditch running parallel to the river, and the ditch water is used to irrigate farm fields on the Mexican side. And tens of thousands of people in both countries live in makeshift housing developments, called colonias, without running water or any sewage service at all.
People have migrated to the region as some tariffs have been gradually lowered and trade between the countries increased. This now includes train loads of grain rumbling south from the American Midwest into Mexico and trucks full of television sets assembled in Mexico heading north. It also includes young men slipping across the border with bags of avocados to sell in El Paso.
Each day thousands of people cross and recross the border to work, shop, visit and play, without thinking very much about it.
"This is in reality a single community divided by political boundaries," observed Don Michie, a professor at the University of Texas, El Paso. Pat O'Rourke, a lifelong resident of El Paso, recalls growing up in an integrated community. "We spoke Spanish at home," he said. "I must have been 5 or 6 years old before I realized that I was not a Mexican."
 
A Lot of Border Traffic
 About 1,500 executives living in the El Paso area go to Juarez each day to manage the factories. And Mexicans flock to the American shops. The Chamber of Commerce estimates that as much as 90 percent of the apparel and other soft goods sold in south El Paso is sold to Mexicans.
It is estimated that there are 42 million legal border crossings a year in the El Paso-Juarez region and countless other illegal ones. To cross legally, Mexicans are required to show a permit and pay a toll of 50 cents. But many do not have the necessary papers, and they simply wade across the fetid stream that is the Rio Grande. Or they spend 30 cents to be pushed across on a inner tube to avoid touching the polluted water.
The huge cross-border traffic means that many problems on one side of the border find their way to the other side in short order.
"There are 68,000 people living in colonias in El Paso County," said Dr. Laurance Nickey, director of El Paso's health and environment district. "In Juarez, there are 400,000 people living in similar or much worse conditions. That poses a potentially serious public health issue."
 
Sanitation Often Inadequate
 The colonias carpet some of the low hills to the east of El Paso, in American territory, and extend along the bottom land near the river. Since there is no zoning in unincorporated areas, attractive concrete-block or brick houses with wrought iron trim sit next to decrepit trailers and auto junk yards. Most have electrical power, but few have adequate sanitation.
Water for drinking and bathing is trucked into the neighborhoods, and represents a major expense for the blue-collar residents of the areas, said Ignatio Escandon, a representative of an interfaith social group.
"In the city, water costs from $20 to $40 a month," he said. "But it can cost $100 to $150 a month out in the county." Private companies sell the water, which sometimes comes right out of a tap on the El Paso side.
Dr. Nickey said that because the water was stored for extended periods in the intense heat of the region, the chlorine used to suppress bacterial growth often dissipated.
"We did a survey of 224 homes in the colonias and found that in 47 percent of the cases, the chlorine had dissipated," he said. "And we found plenty of fecal and coliform bacteria."
 
Charges of Government Neglect
 Many people in El Paso and Juarez say they have long been neglected by their national Governments. The principal benefit of the prospective free trade pact, they say, is that it has focused attention on the environmental and health problems of the border.
"El Paso is so far from Washington and Juarez is so far from Mexico City that nobody paid any attention to our infrastructure problems," said Barbara Perez, president of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce here. "With the treaty, we are finally getting some state and Federal money.
Since the maquiladoras -- assembly plants in Mexico where workers, many of them subsistence farmers in the interior, put together products to be sold in the United States -- have been largely unregulated for the 25 years they have been running, experts say no one knows the extent of contamination on the Mexican side. The recent discovery of a toxic waste dump southeast of Juarez has increased fears that contamination may be seeping toward the common aquifer.
Despite the problems, business people insist that the agreement will increase industrial activity on the continent and that this will redound to everyone's benefit.
"We think that Nafta is going to bring industry back from the Far East to Canada, the United States and Mexico because they will want to be in the Nafta club," said Veronica Callaghan, vice president for marketing of Kasko Ventures, an industrial development company.

Money Market Funds' Yields Are Down Another Notch

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields offered by money market funds ticked down in the latest week as interest rates flattened in the money markets, according to IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report.
The seven-day compounded and simple average yields for tax-exempt funds were both down a basis point, to 2.17 percent and 2.15 percent, respectively. For the 30-day average, the compound and simple yields were 2.20 percent and 2.18 percent, respectively. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. 
 IBC/Donoghue's said the outflow of assets from tax-exempt money funds slowed to $436 million, down from $2 billion last week. The latest drop left the funds with total assets of $96.2 billion.
Walter S. Frank, IBC/Donoghue's chief economist, does not see much change in the weeks ahead until the Federal Reserve sees more data about the economic recovery. "Until the Fed can make a determination on policy, yields will continue to drift with a downward bias." he said.
The average number of days left to maturity of tax-exempt securities held in fund portfolios rose by a day, to 64, as many portfolio managers remained confident that interest rates would not sudddenly back up.
For investors in the 28 percent tax bracket, the taxable equivalent of the current seven-day tax-free yield is 3.01 percent, while the equivalent for investors in the 31 percent tax bracket is 3.14 percent.
In its weekly survey of tax-exempt funds with assets greater than $100 million, Donoghue's said the Strong Municipal Money Market funds, distributed by Strong/Corneliuson in Milwaukee, ran its streak as the best- performing fund to nine weeks, with a return this week of 2.95 percent.
Yields in taxable money market funds also slipped, as assets declined by $1.6 billion, to a total of$499.1 billion. Institutional assets fell $2.4 billion, to $177.4 billion, with public assets up $800 million, to $321.7 billion. Analysts said the outflow of cash from institutions indicated that yields of money market funds were now down near the levels that the institutions were fleeing from when they put money in the funds.
 
Another Down Category
 The average seven-day compounded yield for taxable money market funds was 3.10 percent, down 3 basis points, with the simple yield down a similar amount, to 3.05 percent. For the 30-day average, the compounded and simple yields were both down 4 basis points, to 3.15 percent and 3.10 percent, respectively.
Analysts said the average days left to maturity of securities in portfolios for the week was unchanged at 64, the most in 10 years.
The Standby Reserve Fund, distributed by Cowen & Company in New York, had the best return among general-purpose funds for the third straight week, posting a return of 3.92 percent, unchanged from last week.
By comparison, the average bank money market account is yielding 3.03 percent, according to The Bank Rate Monitor, published in North Palm Beach, Fla.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Mostly Lower While Gold Prices Are Up

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar closed mostly lower in listless trading yesterday, with little news to affect the market.
Gold prices rose. Gold for August delivery gained $2.10 a troy ounce, to $337.90, on the New York Commodity Exchange. The Republic National Bank of New York later quoted a bid of $338.10, up $1.70. 
 The dollar rose a bit after the release of a Government report showing the United States trade deficit narrowed by 7.7 percent in June, to $6.59 billion. The improvement was marginally better than many analysts expected.
But the dollar's rise was short-lived as concern about the economy's long-term health and higher interest rates abroad outweighed the trade gain, analysts said. The interest rate differential makes dollar-denominated investments less attractive since investments transacted in other currencies can earn more.
"The dollar is on the brink of new lows, historic lows," said John Nelson, a currency trader at the New York office of Algemene Bank Nederland.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 126.41 yen, up 0.23 yen from Tuesday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 126.25 yen. In New York, the dollar was quoted at 126.58 yen, up from 126.15 late Tuesday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.9355, from $1.9295 late Tuesday. In New York, one pound cost $1.9350, more expensive than $1.9305 the day before.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday, included: 1.4535 German marks, down from 1.4570; 1.3035 Swiss francs, down from 1.3055; 4.9360 French francs, down from 4.9430; 1,104.00 Italian lire, down from 1,106.00;,and 1.19685 Canadian dollars, down from 1.19855.
Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $338.45 a troy ounce, from $336.00 bid late Tuesday. In Zurich, it rose to a closing bid of $338.00, from $335.60 bid late Tuesday. In Hong Kong, gold rose $1.78 to close at a bid of $337.98.
Silver bullion in London was unchanged at a late bid price of $3.80 a troy ounce. On the Comex in New York, silver was quoted at $3.772 an ounce, up slightly from $3.771 late Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
George Bush's Sins of Omission

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
ACCORDING to the preconvention polls, just one American in seven approved of the way President Bush is handling the economy -- a thumbs-down rating that even Jimmy Carter could not match in the darkest days of the 1980 oil shock.
So what has Mr. Bush done to earn this dubious distinction? 
 Little or nothing. And therein lies the rub.
While keepers of the Reaganomics flame, notably Lawrence Kudlow, the chief economist at Bear, Stearns, do fault him for creating "an incredibly hostile tax and regulatory environment," most analysts think Mr. Bush's economic sins are largely those of omission.
The President, argues Alan Blinder of Princeton University, is a "conservator" by inclination, and thus ill equipped to cope with the knotty economic problems inherited from both the slow-growth 1970's and the what-me-worry? 1980's. Perhaps most damning from the perspective of electoral politics, his conservatism seems to leave little room to empathize with the biggest losers of his tenure -- the poor and the unemployed.
Some who see mischief, or worse, in the Administration's economic policies, point to mandates for cleaner air and the rights of the disabled, which may end up costing business far more than the public benefits they generate. Others, including Martin Feldstein of Harvard University, focus on the flat-footed tightening of bank regulation in the wake of the savings and loan scandal that has made it harder to finance less-than-blue-chip enterprises. And critics from the New Right fault the 1990 budget accord, which raised taxes just as the economy was hitting the wall of recession: "Blaming Congress," said Mr. Kudlow, "is a dog that won't hunt."
But when pressed to list the ways the Bush Administration might have prevented the current downturn or speeded the recovery, most mainstream economists -- including many who would like Mr. Bush to retire permanently to Kennebunkport -- come up short.
The economic slowdown in 1989 was generally greeted with relief, as a lesser-of-possible-evils "soft landing" from the fiscal excesses and unprecedented consumer spending levels of the Reagan years. So were the tax increases in 1990 that in the view of Isabel Sawhill of the Urban Institute made some headway on the chronic deficit problem, albeit at the cost of deepening the recession. And so, too, were the military cuts that have freed resources for long-term growth, but left hundreds of thousands of workers without paychecks.
Indeed, Mr. Bush's inclination to err on the side of caution was widely supported by the economics establishment. "It takes 20-20 hindsight" to second-guess the Administration's micromanagement of the economy, acknowledges Robert Litan of the Brookings Institution. Robert Hall of Stanford University concurs: "There is nothing the Bush Administration did that explains the mysterious and prolonged slowdown since 1990," he said.
Economists are less generous, though, in assigning marks for the President's inclination to innovate in response to unexpected adversity.
Mr. Bush was elected at the cusp of seven years of economic growth, and his only mandate, they acknowledge, was to keep the good times rolling. But the Reagan prosperity, jerry-built on a foundation of imported capital, vanishing private savings, go-for-broke Government spending and regulatory negligence, proved to be unsustainable. And the real challenge facing Bush & Company was twofold: to tackle the economic problems that have been festering since the 1970's while softening the blow to those on the bottom.
Ms. Sawhill of the Urban Institute is unsparing in her criticism of Mr. Bush's record on the latter challenge, the repair of the tattered safety net. "He ignored the first principle" of policy making in the context of free markets: "to compensate the losers," she said. The economy is changing -- and must keep changing -- she continued. "But we just can't ignore the costs during the transition."
And what of the long-term problems, notably the lagging productivity growth that has held hourly earnings constant for the last quarter-century? Lawrence Katz of Harvard University is somewhat forgiving of the President: "We're fairly clueless about what to do about it." But he does find fault with Mr. Bush in ways that echo the complaints of many other economic analysts.
There are two broad approaches to coping with stagnant productivity, he said. One is the supply-siders' fix of choice, emphasizing lower marginal tax rates, savings incentives and reduced regulation. The other is interventionist, relying on public investment, improved education and targeted business subsidies.
But where does the President stand? In the course of paying lip service to the former, suggests the Harvard economist, the Administration has done little of note for either. "I fault him for not sticking to his guns," Mr. Katz concluded.

When Soviet Bureaucrats Were the Last to Know

BYLINE: By BERNARD GWERTZMAN

 BODY:

The System
An Insider's Life in Soviet Politics
By Georgi Arbatov
Introduction by Strobe Talbott. 380 pages.
Times Books. $25.
For the past 25 years, Georgi Arbatov has been recognized as Moscow's leading "Amerikanist." As founder and director of the Institute of U.S.A. and Canada, Mr. Arbatov built his think tank into the source of most significant work about the United States, even though to pass Kremlin muster, almost all the published studies were exceedingly propagandistic. But Mr. Arbatov was no ivory-tower academic. He came to his institute after working as a highly placed Central Committee apparatchik, and he made sure through the years that he continued to serve as an adviser to whoever ruled the Kremlin. 
 To the many Americans who have gotten to know Mr. Arbatov, he has always been something of an enigmatic figure. No one was quite sure who he really was. Many believed that he could not have survived for so many years without strong K.G.B. connections or affiliation. They knew he was very intelligent, but he was such a combative propagandist that he was one of the few Soviets in the Reagan years who was regularly permitted by Moscow to appear on American television to lambaste Washington's policies. He was so pugnacious that he was something of a bore to those who knew him.
But he could not be ignored, because to American public figures wanting to visit the Soviet Union, Mr. Arbatov was in effect the gatekeeper, whose institute made the arrangements for politicians, journalists and others to go to Moscow. But an invitation to speak to the institute was often an exasperating experience for an American looking for an honest exchange of views. The Russians, until the advent of the Gorbachev years, rarely admitted any mistakes or errors to Americans, in public or in private.
His memoirs, which first appeared in somewhat different form in Russian last year, is part of a growing body of historical work now coming out of the former Soviet Union which is adding significantly to our knowledge of how the Kremlin operated. These books, of course, are also meant to defend their authors' reputations at home and abroad.
Mr. Arbatov is well aware that he was perceived in this country as a spokesman at best and toady at worst for the regime. And he clearly wants this book to serve as his apologia. He relates that he is the son of a poor Jewish metalworker who joined the Communist Party in 1917, was arrested without cause in the 1930's and was luckily freed after a year. The arrest of his father, he says, produced an instinctive anti-Stalinist sentiment in the young Arbatov, who served with distinction in the army during the war, but who also learned a lifetime lesson of not trying to buck the system, or risking his career by being indiscreet. No dissident he.
"I pay tribute to the courage and fearlessness of those who, like Andrei Sakharov, risked taking an uncompromising stand," he writes. "These people were heroes, even martyrs. And if they had not done what they did, I think the changes in our country would not have gone forward so quickly. But had it not been for the many hundreds and thousands who worked inside the system, fought routine skirmishes, tried to stop the pressure of Stalinist conservatism, and defended and promoted the ideas of democracy and peaceful economic reform, the process of revitalization would not have been possible at all."
Mr. Arbatov argues with some conviction that although he was not a dissident ready to quit on principle or to issue declarations to the Western press, he did not support any of the key Soviet foreign adventures. On learning in August 1968 of the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia, he asserts: "I was shocked. I could not even bring myself to go on my vacation to the Caucasus . . . I felt ashamed and bitter." He adds that "it made me think for the first time about how pernicious our ruling elite's imperial ambitions were, as were its attempts to keep the empire together by force." Mr. Arbatov says he complained to a few colleagues and that thankfully none informed on his views.
He says he was concerned about the Soviet involvement in Angola in 1975, and protested to President Leonid I. Brezhnev and others that it would ruin detente, which in fact it helped to do. "We were unable to resist further temptation to become involved in the complex internal affairs of other countries," he writes. "After Angola, we went boldly down the path of intervention and expansion that we had beaten so assuredly. It led us through Ethiopia, Yemen, a series of African countries, and, eventually, into Afghanistan."
Mr. Arbatov raises the question of why the Soviet Union deviated from the course of detente into this overseas expansionism. He says it was because "the military-industrial complex had grown to such proportions that it escaped political control." In the Gorbachev years, Mr. Arbatov became a deputy to the Supreme Soviet, and distinguished himself by advocating wholesale cuts in the defense budget, indicating that he was consistent in his criticism of the military.
Whether Mr. Arbatov's explanations will improve his image abroad is speculative. One cannot read this book without some sympathy for him. Yes, he explains, he was often a spokesman for the Soviet side in the United States, but he and others like him "simply did not know many things concerning both domestic and foreign affairs." For example, Soviet positions on arms control were kept secret, he says, "although we were assigned to defend those positions during meetings with parliamentarians and in public statements."
"We had to depend mainly on the Western press, which we were trained to treat with suspicion but which, as we later discovered, was, unfortunately, often right," Mr. Arbatov confesses. As one who regularly reported on Soviet-American relations in the period at hand, I find it fascinating to see that time after time, American intelligence knew more about what was going on in the Soviet Union than well-placed officials like Mr. Arbatov did.
One example. The Reagan Administration regularly complained -- just as the Soviet Government regularly denied -- that Moscow was violating previous arms-control agreements. One of these complaints was that Moscow was building a radar installation at Krasnoyarsk that violated the 1972 arms treaty. Mr. Arbatov says he did not learn until 1986 that when seeking permission to build the radar complex in the late 1970's, the Ministry of Defense "did not hide the fact that the site chosen for the station was a direct breach of the SALT I treaty."

HEADLINE: PARENT & CHILD

BYLINE: By Lawrence Kutner

 BODY:
FOR many years, school was a world children seldom shared with their parents, who mostly caught oblique glimpses through report cards and essays, pageants and P.T.A. meetings. The image of the school volunteer from 30 years ago -- almost always a mother who baked brownies, accompanied classes on field trips or ran the book sale -- sounds impractical if not impossible to many of today's two-career or single-parent families.
The challenge for today's parents is to find other effective ways of participating in their children's schooling. "We need a new definition of what it means to volunteer that doesn't necessarily involve coming to the school building," said Dr. Joyce L. Epstein, the co-director of the Center on Families, Communities, Schools and Children's Learning at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. "Volunteering mostly has to do with parents supporting school goals and children's learning any place and any time." 
 This type of involvement may, in fact, have greater effects on children's learning than the traditional notion of school volunteer work from a generation ago. While no one who's organized one would minimize the need for extra adult help on a class field trip to a museum or other class outing, or belittle the cash raised by a rummage sale, schools that used to encourage those as the primary ways for parents to become active in their children's education may have had hidden agendas.
"The schools tried to keep parents at bay, so mothers were more involved in bringing cookies than in the curriculum," said Dr. Lynn Gordon, an associate professor of education at the University of Rochester who studies the history of schooling. "If you intervened on behalf of your child, you were seen as a domineering mother. The parents of the past 10 years have been far more active than the parents of the 50's in terms of putting pressure on schools."
Parents are now welcomed by their children's schools more enthusiastically than ever before. Administrators see parental involvement as a matter of both practical pedagogy and economic reality, as many schools face larger tasks with smaller budgets. Today's teachers are far more supportive of parents' involvement than they used to be. (My kindergarten teacher told my mother that I shouldn't learn to read at home, because I'd be "bored" in the first grade. Luckily, my mother paid little attention to her.)
Even so, many parents and teachers still harbor misconceptions about their respective roles and how they can work together. Parents -- especially those who have less education than the teachers -- sometimes feel uncomfortable talking with teachers as partners. It is as if by entering the building, they have once again become students in an inherently unequal relationship with the teachers and administration.
Also, teachers may falsely assume that single parents and dual-career couples are uninterested or unable to participate.
"There's a misconception that dual-career couples are uninvolved with their children," said Dr. Lucia Gilbert, a professor of educational psychology at the University of Texas in Austin, who studies the effects on children of having two parents who work outside the home. "The reality is that they spend as much if not more time with their children than so-called traditional families."
Other researchers have found that, on average, single mothers are at least as involved in their children's schoolwork as other mothers. They're less involved in matters that involve visiting the school, however, because they don't have as much time available, especially during regular school hours.
Today's fathers, whose own fathers probably seldom set foot in their children's schools for matters that didn't involve either sports or discipline, are also more active, especially in evening activities. "When push comes to shove in families, it's the mother who usually takes time off from work," said Dr. Barbara Gutek, a visiting professor of management and policy at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, who studies work and family issues.
 
Interest in Child's Schoolwork Shows Love
 THE reason for parents' involvement in their children's education is simple: it's a good long-term investment.
"Families that stay involved, informed and influential in their children's education have children who do better in school," said Dr. Joyce L. Epstein, the co-director of the Center on Families, Communities, Schools and Children's Learning at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.
It's good for the parent-child relationship, too, said Dr. Rudolf Ekstein, a clinical professor of psychology at the University of California at Los Angeles. "Saying you have no time is a dreadful rationalization that breaks the bonds between parents and children," he said. "Finding the time is a way of telling your children you love them."
Here are some specific things to keep in mind:
Encourage schools to adapt parent-teacher communication to the schedules and needs of today's parents.
Even simple and inexpensive things like providing on-site child care can significantly increase the number of parents who attend routine teacher conferences. Also, find out the times of each of your children's teachers' free periods so that you can arrange to speak to them by phone.
Ask children specific questions about what they're doing in school.
Simply asking, "How was your day at school, dear?" probably won't yield useful information.
"Children can spot the insincerity," said Dr. Lucia Gilbert, a professor of educational psychology at the University of Texas in Austin. "They clam up and stop sharing. But children love it if you ask them something specific, such as how their presentation went in English class that they told you about the day before."
Stay involved as your children get older.
Many parents have less communication with their children's teachers in high school than when the children were much younger. "The effect is cumulative," Dr. Epstein said. "If you're involved only when your children are in preschool, that won't help when your children are older."
But realize that adolescents are going to be more reticent to share their concerns. Let older children know that you're still interested in what's going on in school. Share with them some of what's happening to you at work. That will help them feel more comfortable talking to you when they need to.

HEADLINE: Subway Stations: Going Fast

 BODY:
It's a sound idea: Require developers of big real estate projects to improve nearby subway stations in return for zoning breaks, or to alleviate congestion their projects might cause. The concept worked well during the 1980's. But with development now at a standstill, New Yorkers are suffering shabby subway stations from Times Square to Atlantic Avenue.
The developers of the now-stalled plan to build four massive office towers on Times Square were supposed to spend $91 million to modernize the 42d Street station. More than 266,000 people, including visitors from all over the world, use that dark, dank station daily. Similar conditions mar the Columbus Circle station, the 72d Street IRT station and Brooklyn's Atlantic Avenue terminal, all deprived of improvements by the collapse of development. 
 The M.T.A., which spends plenty on renovating stations that are not scheduled for help from developers, says it can't do more because it has higher priorities in its $10 billion capital plan. These include buying 1,500 badly needed buses and installing tunnel fans and track switches, critical safety measures that indeed deserve to come first. But transit and city officials ought to move station improvement up on their list, rethink the capital plan now pending before the Legislature, and lobby with even more urgency for Federal and state transit funds.
In the case of Times Square, the state Urban Development Corporation sensibly proposes that if the developers ultimately build their towers they reimburse the Transit Authority for any taxpayer money spent on the station. It would also make sense for the T.A. to proceed quickly with its own plan, already financed, for modernizing the shuttle to Grand Central Terminal.
The beguiling concept of having developers "pay" for zoning concessions succeeded in many instances -- at the 50th Street IND station and at Worldwide Plaza and at Citicorp in Long Island City, to name two. It may succeed again. Meantime, in this economy, government must search for other sources -- including government.

HEADLINE: George Bush's New World

 BODY:
The single most important event in President Bush's erratic re-election campaign -- more important than tonight's "make or break" speech -- may have been his decision to recruit his old and valued friend James Baker to impose order on chaos. Mr. Baker brings to this campaign what George Bush has so far not conveyed: a coherent statement of the Administration's achievements in the past four years and its goals for the next four.
Of all the questions about George Bush, one dominates: What's he for? At the last Convention it was enough, after eight harsh years of Ronald Reagan, to promise "a kinder, gentler nation," to speak of "an endless, enduring dream and a thousand points of light." Those phrases seem mere pieties now in a time of recession and drift. 
 Today Mr. Bush's task is far more daunting: to convince the electorate that he has a clear idea of how to cure America's domestic ills -- and will bring to domestic policy the same energy he has brought to foreign affairs.
He could do worse than take as his text Mr. Baker's remarkable farewell address at the State Department last week. Mr. Baker told his colleagues that his and the President's preoccupation with foreign policy was nothing to be ashamed of. The cold war did not end of its own accord. That took patient, skillful diplomacy and an unwavering belief that good things will happen "if we use our strengths as a nation wisely."
The same dedication, he said, had produced other stunning successes: assembling an "unprecedented" coalition, including the Russians, to confront Saddam Hussein of Iraq; and then persuading the Arabs and the Israelis to reason together.
For all these achievements and more, Mr. Bush is surely entitled to enormous credit. But Americans are also entitled to ask: What's next? And what about us? For they are mystified, and rightly so, about how a President so confident and assured in dealing with great international questions can seem so diffident, bewildered and captious on home ground.
Here again, one can find a coherent message in Mr. Baker's text. Having taken huge strides toward a new world order, he suggested, George Bush had at least earned the right to address America's new world. "America must appropriate new approaches for the changes at home," the Secretary said, "just as we have launched policies to manage the change abroad."
He spoke of fundamental needs like economic security, education and job training and, in language like Bill Clinton's, of America's historic openness "to trade, to investment, to ideas and to people." Mr. Baker conceded that none of his ideas were revolutionary but that, if presented and pressed as an organized "package," they could transform America into both a "military superpower" and an "export superpower."
Mr. Baker's ringing assertion that the moment had come to convert triumph abroad into progress at home defines the President's task. Time and again, most notably after the gulf war, Mr. Bush has squandered matchless opportunities to spend in some noble domestic purpose the political capital earned on the world's stage. This Convention, and this campaign, give him one more chance.

The Three Middles

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: HOUSTON

 BODY:
Extricating himself delicately from the fervent embrace of party activists who never liked him, and professing never to have read their hard-right platform, George Bush will seek re-election by going after what a Chinese pundit would call "the three middles": the middle class, the Middle West, and the middle of the political spectrum.
Because Roger Ailes is here to direct, we can look forward to a strong but not strident delivery of an acceptance speech. Because the speech was drafted by the libertarian Nixonite Ray Price ("the lift of a driving dream") and emended by the ultrapragmatic Bakerite Robert Zoellick, we can expect a thematic address. 
 Mr. Bush will dare spend a little time on foreign affairs; that's his strength on the "trust" issue, and Bill Clinton gave him an opening by touching the subject so lightly in Madison Square Garden. Then he will present a broad plan of economic action -- no new tax cut or laundry list, but a much stronger hold-the-line on spending.
In that redefining speech, he is likely to acknowledge economic error not so much for caving in to a tax increase but in not moving aggressively to curb spending and stop the explosion of the deficit. He could then more credibly ask the hard-hit middle class for another chance -- not for "four more years" of dickering and dithering, but in Bill Bennett's apt phrase, "four different years."
Essential to that difference is a change of failed faces. The economic quadriad has been a flop; all but the Fed's Alan Greenspan should soon find their futures in the private sector.
Not yet decided, I am told by those who should know, is the future of James Baker. He wants to return to Foggy Bottom and bestride the world; but Mr. Bush, who would like to do his own global bold-stroking, has demonstrated that he needs a skilled Deputy President to handle all the boring domestic stuff. Until this indecision at the top is resolved, the campaign will have a hole at the center.
The second "middle" is geographic. Though he can never admit it, the President knows the Far West and the Northeast are gone; to win, he must secure the Republican lock on Southern and Rocky Mountain states, while going for broke to win crucial Illinois, Ohio and Pennsylvania.
Accordingly, he will come out of convention week with a visit to Biloxi, Miss., then preach to the evangelical choir in Dallas. That's early base-securing, as is a Bush stop in New Jersey, winnable because of voter fury at a taxing Democratic Governor. But the real contesting begins when he hits Chicago.
If he is dry-gulched in his Southern base, of course, the President has little hope. We have all forgotten Ross Perot, but that vengeful figure is still on the ballot in Texas. If he wants to play the spoiler, the brooding memoirist could campaign in October as a protest candidate; I am told by a former Democratic and Republican politician (John Connally says howdy) that Perot protest could attract up to 15 percent of the vote here, delivering Texas and the election to Mr. Clinton.
The third middle is political centrism. That suffered a prime-time setback when Pat Buchanan nailed George Bush to the far-right platform, declaring without rebuttal the President to be "on our side" in the "religious war" and "cultural war" for "the soul of America" over a pastiche of abortion, women in combat, homosexual rights, school prayer and pornography. That speech hurt Mr. Bush's moderate self-image more than anything said at the Democratic Convention.
How to play the slightly-right-of-centrist, the self he is most comfortable with, without infuriating the hard-right hard core? Two ways:
His aides and religio-cultural warriors will work on the character issue; this will not trouble the Presidential conscience, as Hillary Clinton was the first to publicly activate rumors about Mr. Bush's fidelity.
That will free the President to take a higher road, drawing the real difference between the parties on health care, jobs versus smoke, and free trade. He plans to take the center not so much by moving there but by pushing the perception of the Democrats to the far left.
That's the three-middle plan. No big secret. With a foreign-crisis boost, it might work.

Who Won the Cold War?

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
Republican claims this week that they won the cold war prompt me to reveal an off-the-record conversation I had with the Chief of the Soviet General Staff in 1983. Marshal Nikolai Ogarkov told me at that time -- before President Reagan's increases in military spending fully took hold, six years before the Soviet empire in Eastern Europe crumbled and eight years before the Soviet Union itself collapsed -- that the cold war was already essentially over, if not finally won by the West.
I had known the beribboned marshal for years, when I was a Government official and a correspondent. He was always brilliant, plain-spoken and hard-line. We talked on a wintry March afternoon, just days after Mr. Reagan's speech aptly described the Soviet Union as "an evil empire." 
 I began that afternoon by attacking Moscow for amassing forces that far exceeded defensive needs. He waved me off with a tolerant smile. Then he proceeded to make the most astonishing argument I had ever heard from a Soviet official.
Numbers of troops and weapons mean little, he said. We cannot equal the quality of U.S. arms for a generation or two. Modern military power is based upon technology, and technology is based upon computers.
In the U.S., he continued, small children -- even before they begin school -- play with computers. Computers are everywhere in America. Here, we don't even have computers in every office of the Defense Ministry. And for reasons you know well, we cannot make computers widely available in our society.
Then came his portentous punch line: We will never be able to catch up with you in modern arms until we have an economic revolution. And the question is whether we can have an economic revolution without a political revolution.
In so many words, Marshal Ogarkov was acknowledging that the Communist system was not working and could not work. He was saying, in effect, that the Soviet Union without radical change was incapable of competing with the U.S.
Less than a year after our conversation, the "authorities" mysteriously removed Marshal Ogarkov from his high office -- without explanation. Several years later, the marshal's volcanic logic was to be resurrected publicly by Mikhail Gorbachev as he launched perestroika and glasnost.
Honest historians and politicians will honestly contend over exactly who won the cold war and how. But the following propositions seem to me to be roughly true:
* The Soviets lost the cold war because of the rot of the Communist system far more than we won it by the policy of containing Soviet power.
* Containment was an essential ingredient, and Democrats created that policy and promoted it as fervently as Republicans. After the Vietnam War, however, Democrats emphasized diplomatic and economic means over military power, and Republicans stressed the reverse. True, many liberal Democrats naively believed Moscow could be loved into good behavior. As true, many conservative Republicans exaggerated Soviet might and espoused confrontations that could have provoked war.
* In combating Soviet thrusts abroad, Democrats approved aid to the Afghan mujahedeen fighting Soviet troops as solidly as Republicans did. Many Democrats hesitated about aid to Angolan rebels because they seemed as bad as their Communist opponents. Republicans demanded arms for the Nicaraguan contras, but most Democrats resisted aid without serious negotiating efforts, a position President Bush ultimately adopted.
* The Reagan military buildup, backed by a minority of Democrats, certainly added to Soviet economic woes and probably speeded up Communism's demise. Most Democrats, however, felt and feel that whatever was gained by this course was far outweighed by costs to the American economy and domestic priorities.
The shameless distortion of this record by Republicans in Houston can be partially pardoned as politics. Unpardonable is their continuing blindness to the principal lesson of the cold war -- the Soviet empire collapsed abroad because it had failed at home.
Thus Republicans in Houston still seem more interested in praising themselves unduly for slaying an already dying Red Dragon than in preparing to restore an America they virtually ignored for 12 years.

HEADLINE: Real Men Don't Need To Avoid 'the Couch'

 BODY:
To the Editor:
A recent survey of psychologists shows that our profession views the family's decline as the most important mental health issue in America. Thus I read with interest "O.K. on the Self-Realization; What About the Economy?" (front page, July 27).
Gov. Bill Clinton, Senator Al Gore and their families show how helpful psychological treatment can be in supporting today's beleaguered American family. President Bush's spokesmen, however, showed a shallow grasp of the needs of families confronting substandard schools, unemployment and drug abuse. 
 Statements attributed to the Bush Administration like "Real men don't use the couch" and references to "macho individualists" suggest a commitment to outdated, harmful stereotypes. "Real men" strive for honest communication with their families, and they don't need to prove their masculinity by avoiding "the couch."

HEADLINE: A DELICATE BALANCE: The Gay Vote;
Gay Rights and AIDS Emerging As Divisive Issues in Campaign

BYLINE: By JEFFREY SCHMALZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Aug. 19

 BODY:
Homosexual issues, which for months were derided with winks and nods by Republicans as they talked of family values, have flared into the open at the party's national convention here and on the streets outside the Astrodome.
Beginning with a speech by Patrick J. Buchanan on Monday night and continuing with remarks by other Republicans over the last two days, the party made it clear that it would make its opposition to homosexual rights a major issue in the campaign, portraying Bill Clinton and the Democrats as wanting to give preferential treatment to gay men and lesbians. 
 The Republican comments -- coming after a strong endorsement of gay rights by Mr. Clinton during the primary season and by Democrats at their convention last month -- means that for the first time, the Presidential candidates are engaging in open debate over sharply different views on gay rights and AIDS.
"It could be the wedge issue of this campaign, the Willie Horton issue," said William Schneider, a political analyst with the American Enterprise Institute. "It's risky for the Republicans. They can't appear repressive. But polls show people are uncomfortable with it. They don't approve of it. The Democrats can't be perceived as promoting it. It's not clear how it's going to play out, because we've never had it in a Presidential race like this before."
This year, unlike four years ago, representatives of homosexual-rights groups were not permitted to speak before the Republican platform committee. And unlike four years ago, the 1992 platform includes a passage referring to homosexuals: "We oppose efforts by the Democratic Party to include sexual preference as a protected minority receiving preferential status under civil rights statutes at the Federal, state and local level."
In some ways, there are parallels between the convention's handling of the gay-rights and abortion questions. In both cases, conservatives prevailed in disputes over uncompromising platform planks. Aides to Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts said he had wanted to include a discussion of gay rights in his address to the convention on Tuesday night but had been asked by party officials not to.
 
Gays in 'God's Country'
 Mr. Buchanan, in his speech on Monday night, pointed out that Gov. Robert P. Casey of Pennsylvania, who opposes abortion rights, had not been allowed to speak at the Democratic National Convention in New York last month. Then he added: "Yet a militant leader of the homosexual rights movement could rise at that convention and exult: 'Bill Clinton and Al Gore represent the most pro-lesbian and pro-gay ticket in history.' And so they do."
Mr. Buchanan went on to include homosexual rights in a list of negatives that he said Mr. Clinton would impose on the nation, along with abortion on demand and women in combat. "It's not the kind of change we can tolerate," he said, "in a nation that we still call God's country."
Homosexual-rights groups, most of which have endorsed Mr. Clinton, responded today with outrage, saying they had expected to be attacked, but not so blatantly or ferociously.
"This is the most explicitly anti-gay campaign we've ever seen," said Urvashi Vaid, the executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force and a Clinton supporter. "It's hateful. The party is saying, 'We don't want you.' We're the only ones left to attack. Communism is gone. There's too much support for women's issues. The Los Angeles riots make it impossible to attack blacks, and the party is wooing them anyway. That leaves us as the ones to beat on to divert attention from the economy and other failings."
In their public comments today, Republican officials were cautious in their remarks on gay issues. At the party's official morning briefing on the day's family-values convention theme, they avoided questions about gay men and lesbians.
But privately top Bush campaign officials said they would hit the issue hard in the campaign, portraying Mr. Clinton as a promoter of homosexuals. Campaign aides said radio ads were being considered that would run only in the South and would portray a Clinton victory as sure to lead to more gay teachers in the schools.
The campaign officials argued, however, that Mr. Bush was not antihomosexual and that he merely opposed giving gay men and lesbians special treatment. They pointed out that he had signed legislation ordering a Federal study of hate crimes, including attacks on homosexuals, the first time a Federal law had extended civil rights on the basis of sexual orientation.
 
'A Willie Horton Issue'
 Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the second-ranking Republican in the House, said: "You can look at the issue three ways -- tolerance, repression and promotion. Repression and promotion are equal extremes. Every American should be protected from violence. But no American deserves to have special privilege."
George Stephanopoulos, Mr. Clinton's communications director, said the Democrats did not support quotas. Referring to Mr. Gingrich's comments, he said it was not clear what Republicans meant by "promotion."
Governor Clinton, interviewed tonight on NBC News, said he did not advocate giving recognition to homosexual marriages, as some Republicans have maintained. "What I have advocated is the absence of discrimination in employment," he said. "And the fact that status alone should not be enough to kick someone out of the military who has otherwise served well. They ought to argue those issues, not these bogus issues that they keep bringing up."
Mr. Clinton, who turned 46 years old today, has been more outspoken on gay issues than previous Democratic Presidential candidates, in part because he grew up at a time when homosexuals were growing more open about their sexual orientation.
 Before Mr. Clinton, the party had never pressed the matter at the Presidential level. Four years ago, Michael S. Dukakis seemed uncomfortable with gay issues, even though the party's official position was to support gay rights. There was little difference between Mr. Dukakis's stand on AIDS, for example, and Mr. Bush's position.
This time, the two candidates are at odds over such issues as whether to allow openly gay members of the military, which Mr. Clinton supports and Mr. Bush opposes.
Tonight, the Rev. Pat Robertson picked up on that issue, telling the convention that Mr. Clinton "would destroy the traditional family" and citing as evidence that the Democratic candidate would "repeal the ban on homosexual's in the military and appoint homosexuals to his cabinet."
Both inside and outside the Astrodome, the difference in tone between the Republican and Democratic conventions is striking. There are no openly gay delegates here, only two alternates. Gay Republicans said they had trouble finding gay people to run on slates for Mr. Bush or Mr. Buchanan. At the Democratic convention, there were 110 openly gay delegates. In New York, signs throughout the convention hall proclaimed lesbian and gay rights. Here there are signs like "Family Rights Forever/Gay Rights Never."
Perhaps the only kind word at the convention about homosexuals came tonight when Mary Fisher addressed the gathering about her infection with the virus that causes AIDS. "I am one," she said, "with the lonely gay man sheltering a flickering candle from the cold wind of his family's rejection."
 
Protests and Demonstrations
 Throughout this week, Act Up, the AIDS advocacy group, has made its presence felt strongly. Some 2,000 people marched on the convention hall Monday night, burning Mr. Bush in effigy before being dispersed by mounted police in a confrontation in which a half dozen demonstrators were clubbed as they chanted: "We're here! We're queer! We're not gonna go!" Mr. Bush was disrupted twice today by Act Up hecklers while speaking at a Republican National Committee event, and the Rev. Jerry Falwell was disrupted while speaking at another event.
But for no other gay group here has the Republican stand on homosexual issues been more painful than for gay Republicans. At a meeting over the weekend, representatives of the Log Cabin Federation, which represents 6,000 gay Republicans throughout the country, voted not to endorse Mr. Bush. Many expressed support for Mr. Clinton, but the group's bylaws prohibit endorsing a Democrat.
Group members couldn't help smiling as they cited what they called the hypocrisy of the party leaders. "There are plenty of gay people working for George Bush and around him," said Tony Zampella of San Diego. "We know it. He knows it. Who's kidding who?"

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about AIDS and homosexual issues misstated the political position of Urvashi Vaid, the executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force. Ms. Vaid has not endorsed either Presidential candidate.

HEADLINE: UNDER THE DOME: News Analysis;
Bush in a Truman Mode

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Aug. 19

 BODY:
Harry S. Truman, the American President at the start of the cold war, has become the patron saint of George Bush, the President at the end.
 That provides one crucial clue to the kind of campaign Mr. Bush plans to wage. He will denounce the House and Senate Democrats, echoing Truman's 1948 attacks on the "do-nothing, good-for-nothing 80th Congress." 
The only way to break the deadlock in Washington, Mr. Bush said at a pep rally today, "is to clear out the deadwood on Capitol Hill, and I'm going to do what Harry Truman did -- take that case to the American people."
 Although he was the incumbent, Truman campaigned like a challenger, and Mr. Bush plans to try that, too, taking the offensive whenever possible to shed his reputation as a guardian of the status quo in an era of change.
 Unless there is Herculean last-minute rewriting, the President will deliver a speech on Thursday night short on economic details and Cabinet shuffles but long on fight, like Truman's speech in the stifling Philadelphia heat 44 years ago, with its brassy promise to "win this election and make those Republicans like it."
 
More Personal and Caustic
 But if the Republican campaign bears any resemblance to the Republican convention, and party leaders say it will, it will be a lot more personal and a lot more caustic than anything that the voters of 1948 heard.
 Mr. Bush, or at least his campaign, plans to go after not only Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas but also the Democratic nominee's wife, Hillary. A senior strategist said: "No sleaze, but maybe some draft-dodging, a lot about his record as Governor, and plenty about Hillary. She's more than fair game."
 Some of it will be done with a sledgehammer, like Pat Robertson's assertion tonight, unsupported by evidence, that the Clintons "are talking about a radical plan to destroy the traditional family and transfer its functions to the Federal Government."
 And some of it will be done with gossamer innuendo, like Marilyn Quayle's comment that in the 1960's "not everyone demonstrated, dropped out, took drugs, joined in the sexual revolution or dodged the draft."
 In three nights of speeches and interviews here, Mr. Bush and other orators have attempted to depict Mr. Clinton as the failed governor of a small state (50th in average family income, in jobs for young people, in environmental policy, said Senator Phil Gramm of Texas); as a member of a taxing, spending party that knows nothing about security or patriotism; as a closet leftist, the political clone of Jimmy Carter, and, in general, as someone without either the experience or the character to inspire trust.
 
Harder to Demonize
 Whether that unflattering portrait will stick, once Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton share the television screen for a few weeks, rather than one or the other dominating it during their conventions, is doubtful. Mr. Clinton's baby face and his softspoken way make him harder to demonize, some Republican media specialists believe, than either Mr. Carter or Michael S. Dukakis, the 1988 Democratic nominee, just as, on the other side of the partisan line, it was easier to make people fear Richard M. Nixon or Barry Goldwater than Ronald Reagan or Dwight D. Eisenhower.
 Torrents of words have flowed to celebrate Mr. Bush as Navy pilot, Mr. Bush as devoted family man, Mr. Bush as Texan, Mr. Bush as capitalist, Mr. Bush as liberator of Kuwait and Mr. Bush as the victor of the cold war.
 Many Republicans, like the former White House chief of staff, John H. Sununu, and Senator Alan Simpson of Wyoming, are convinced that the President's comeback has already begun, well before his big speech. The word of the hour is "energized," meaning that the party faithful inside the convention hall and outside have been stirred from their torpor, and signs of defeatism have been banished.
 "He's fired up," Jeb Bush said of his father in a comment typical of the emerging we-can-lick-'em mood. "He eats nails for breakfast."
 
Little on the 'Job Thing'
 But the Republicans have not yet done what party leaders have been talking about for months. They have said astonishingly little about jobs, and they have not laid out their second-term vision -- that word Mr. Bush hates. They have not succeeded in portraying Mr. Bush as a President with a plan, especially a plan that will improve the average American's economic lot.
 "We need to do more," said former Gov. Thomas H. Kean of New Jersey, a delegate here. "We need something strong and positive on Thursday."
 No one expects Mr. Bush to do a Demosthenes. It doesn't have to be a great acceptance speech, maybe not even as good as the speech he made in New Orleans four years ago, the pros are saying, but a bad one would be a disaster.
 The reason is evident in the returns from a new CBS News poll, released tonight. As expected, the relentless attacks on Mr. Clinton have eroded the favorable impression of him that voters gained during and after the Democratic convention in New York last month. But their impression of Mr. Bush has not changed much, and more people have a negative view of the President than a positive one.
 Only half the convention's job is done.
 Because voters once thought so highly of Mr. Bush, especially after the Persian Gulf war, it is reasonable to assume they could do so again. But only, as a Houston businessman said today, "if he can convince them that he's found a way to get the economy off the track he's gotten it onto."
 That will not be easy. A man's words -- even a President's words -- have to be powerful to convince people to set aside the evidence of their own unhappy experiences and those of their friends in making voting decisions.
 In addition, Mr. Clinton will fight back. He already has. With humor: Responding to the attacks on Mrs. Clinton here, he said, "You'd think he was running for First Lady." And with scorn: "They haven't had anything positive tosay about themselves. If I were the Republicans, I'd be more worried about what I could do for America than how I could bad-mouth Bill Clinton and Al Gore and Hillary Clinton and Tipper Gore."
 The President knows, a close friend said the other day, that "this could be Gotterdammerung." At times, he said, the normally chipper Mr. Bush has been blue, but not so much since he bonded with Harry Truman.
 
Legendary Memo Recalled
 Months ago Representative Newt Gingrich, the Georgia conservative who is the House minority whip, gave Mr. Bush a copy of the now-legendary 1947 memo, written by James A. Rowe Jr. and Clark Clifford, on which Truman based his campaign. Then the President got a copy of David McCullough's monumental new biography, "Truman," read the first 60 pages, jumped to page 653 and devoured the chapter on the 1948 campaign. He talked with Mr. McCullough before a White House lecture.
 Never mind that one grew up poor, Baptist and Democratic on a farm in Missouri and the other grew up rich, Episcopalian and Republican in Greenwich, Conn. Never mind that times were good in 1948, with a rousing economy, not a sluggish recovery. Or that Harry Truman never trailed in the Gallup Poll trial heats by more than 13 percent late in August, while George Bush came to Houston 17 points adrift in the pre-convention New York Times/CBS News Poll.
 What matters to the President is that Truman was also the heir to one of the century's most magnetic politicians, also suffered by comparison, also had problems with Congress, also had trouble giving a good speech, and also was written off as a loser by a lot of politicians and a lot of reporters.
 Then he won.

HEADLINE: Forget About the American Century . . .

BYLINE: By John B. Judis; John B. Judis is author of "Grand Illusion: Critics and Champions of the American Century."

DATELINE: KENSINGTON, Md.

 BODY:
Since Operation Desert Storm, President Bush, invoking the famous phrase of Henry Luce, has boasted repeatedly of a "Next American Century." At the Republican National Convention, Ronald Reagan and Housing Secretary Jack Kemp took up the theme.
Mr. Reagan, noting that his own life had coincided with the "American Century," attacked "the pundits and finger-pointers who are down on us as a nation" and promised that "America's best days are yet to come." Mr. Kemp, not to be outdone, declared that Americans were "on the eve of a new century and a new millennium." But what were once fighting words have become, in the mouths of these Republicans, empty promises and tokens of nostalgia. 
 In February 1941, Henry Luce, the founder of Time magazine, called for America to enter the war against Nazi Germany in order to create a "First American Century."
The U.S. had already become the world's leading economic power; now, he argued, Americans should assume the military responsibility commensurate with their economic power. If they did, Mr. Luce believed, the country could eventually create a great commercial empire that "has within it the possibilities of such enormous progress as to stagger the imagination."
When the U.S. emerged from World War II commanding 50 percent of the world's gross national product, Henry Luce appeared to be vindicated.
But America's situation is now almost reversed from what it was then. Trade and budget deficits aside, the U.S. trails Japan and Germany in consumer electronics, robotics and many other critical industries of the 21st century. The U.S. today is at the end rather than at the beginning of its century.
Mr. Bush and the Republicans seem to be only ones who don't understand this. They act as if the U.S. could pursue the same overall strategy in 1992 that it did in 1942 or 1962.
President Bush, who spoke of the "American Century" and the defeat of "Baghdad bullies" in a speech to disabled veterans earlier this month, has continued to identify America's international standing with its military might. And Mr. Bush, like Ronald Reagan, has limited his economic policy to championing tax breaks for the wealthy at home while using American power and diplomacy to open foreign markets and to guarantee cheap imported natural resources.
But this strategy -- manifested most recently in the Administration's dogged pursuit of the North American Free Trade Agreement -- is no longer enough.
In the 1940's, American economic problems were primarily external -- a lack of markets. In the 1990's, the problems are primarily internal and stem from a corporate structure that discourages long-term investment, ossified labor management relations an ill-educated work force and a political ethos that accentuates social divisions and makes difficult budgetary choices impossible.
A strategy fixed on external enemies and barriers only aggravates the internal weaknesses. Further tax breaks combined with continued high military spending will make it even more difficult to solve our fiscal problems.
And the internal weaknesses undermine an external strategy. For instance, the new trade agreement, particularly as it relates to Mexico, will increase the foreign profits of U.S. banks and insurance companies, but it will also encourage footloose American corporations to transfer production out of the U.S.
Certainly, the answer to America's problems is not the isolation that Henry Luce warned against. But to achieve a "Next American Century," our politicians will have to acknowledge honestly our present straits at home, and refrain from indulging in the escapist fantasies of a new millennium that have been echoing in the Astrodome.

HEADLINE: IN THEIR OWN WORDS;
Excerpts From Vice President Quayle's Address

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the speech last night by Vice President Dan Quayle to the Republican National Convention accepting the party's Vice-Presidential nomination, as transcribed by The New York Times.
I know my critics wish I were not standing here tonight. They don't like our values. They look down on our beliefs. They're afraid of our ideas. And they know the American people stand on our side. And that's -- and that's why, when someone confronts them and challenges them, they will stop at nothing to destroy him. And I say to them: You have failed. I stand -- I stand before you, and before the American people -- unbowed, unbroken and ready to keep fighting for our beliefs. 
 I come -- I come from Huntington, a small farming community in Indiana. I had an upbringing like many in my generation -- a life built around family, public school, Little League, basketball and church on Sunday. My brother and I shared a room in our two-bedroom house. And we walked to school together. . . .
Marilyn and I have tried to teach our children these values, like faith in God, love of family and appreciation of freedom. We have also taught them about family issues like adoption -- my parents adopted twins when I was 10 years old. We have taught our children to respect single parents and their challenges -- challenges that faced my grandmother many years ago, and my own sister today.

 	 	 		. . .	 	The gap between us and our opponents is a cultural divide. It is not just a difference between being conservative and liberal; it is a difference between fighting for what's right and refusing to see what's wrong.
Families can also be strengthened by empowering our people -- with low taxes, home ownership, parental choice in education, job training, safe streets, a clean environment and affordable health care. In all of these areas we have a reform agenda, and it's time for Congress to get out of the way and to pass the President's plan.
 
Lawyers and Regulations
 Speaking of reform, our legal system is spinning out of control. The explosion of frivolous lawsuits burdens our economy and weakens our system of justice. America has 5 percent of the world's population and 70 percent of the world's lawyers. Now, I have nothing against lawyers -- at least most of them. I'm a lawyer, and I'm married to a lawyer.
When we worked our way through night law school, Marilyn and I looked forward with pride to becoming part of the finest legal system in the world. But today our country has a problem: our legal system is costing consumers $300 billion dollars a year. The litigation explosion has damaged our competitiveness; it has wiped out jobs; it has forced doctors to quit practicing in places where they're needed most. Every American knows the legal system is broken -- and now is the time to fix it.
The President's Council on Competitiveness, which I chair, will continue to lead the charge against unnecessary Federal regulation. We've worked to save jobs, and to save lives. We have reformed the drug approval process to speed up the availability of new medicines for people with life-threatening diseases like cystic fibrosis, cancer and AIDS.
 
Time to Change Congress
 And what -- what is the response of the Democrats in Congress? They have tried to kill the Council on Competitiveness, which stands up for the American people and against the bureaucrats and against the special interests. They -- they think the Competitiveness Council should go. They don't get it. It's time for them to go. You know -- you know, if the Democrats in Congress -- if the Democrats in Congress can't run their own restaurant, can't run their own post office, can't run their own bank, they sure can't be trusted to run our country.

 	 	 		. . .	 	It's been said, and it is true, that "a leader gives his people character." And once again America is going to choose a leader who has judgment, experience and moral strength. Four years ago, none of us knew that the Berlin Wall would fall, the Iron Curtain would be lifted, the Baltic nations would be free, Communism would be dead and buried, the Soviet Union would cease to exist and the threatening SS-18 ballistic missiles would be history.
Nor did we know that we would be called upon to confront the aggression of a Middle East tyrant.
But four years ago we did know this: Whatever lay ahead, there was a clear choice to lead us. There was one man we could trust to guide our journey to a new century. And because we elected George Bush as our President, America is stronger, and the world is safer.
My friends, listen to this. In an attempt to establish credibility in foreign policy, Governor Clinton recently compared himself to former Gov. Ronald Reagan. I know Ronald Reagan. Ronald Reagan is a friend of mine and Bill Clinton, you're no Ronald Reagan. The Democratic nominee calls America "the mockery of the world," but he and his running mate are the only ones that believe that. To Governor Clinton I say this: America is the greatest nation in the world, and that's one thing you're not going to change.
These last four years, I have worked with a man who represents so much of what is good in our country -- a man whose public and personal life are the embodiment of character. Every day in that Oval Office, I see the dedication of a husband, father and grandfather; the self-reliance of an entrepreneur; the courage of a Navy pilot; the dependability of a loyal friend; the compassion of a man of faith; and the wisdom of the man who married Barbara Bush.
George Bush has given us great victories abroad and performed great deeds at home. But, as Theodore Roosevelt said, "the greatest victories are yet to be won, and the greatest deeds are yet to be done."

HEADLINE: Investors await Speech Stocks Off Slightly

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Stock prices eased slightly on Wall Street yesterday, with investors quietly awaiting President Bush's acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention.
A recovery in bank shares, after a big selloff on Wednesday, added some support to the session, which ended mixed. 
 After waffling, the Dow Jones industrial average ended 2.17 points lower at 3,304.89. Losing issues outnumbered gainers by 963 to 779 on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume retreated to 183.4 million shares, from 187.1 million on Wednesday.
Investors were awaiting the President's speech in Houston to see whether it would include a proposed change in tax policy or new economic initiatives.
"I don't think there's too much downside, but at the same time, there's not too much upside," said Rao Chalasani, chief investment strategist at Kemper Securities. "The market's been trading in a 3,200 to 3,400 range."
He said he was somewhat surprised that stocks did not gain much ahead of the President's speech.
 Treasury bonds were little changed in quiet trading, with the 30-year benchmark bond off just 3/32 at 995/32 , where it yielded 7.32 percent, up from 7.31 percent at the end of the day Wednesday.
Some analysts said investors were only using the Bush speech as an excuse to stay on the sidelines.
"There's nothing he can say that will suddenly turn things around," said John McElroy, principal at 1838 Investment Advisors L.P. "I think the speech has been so hyped up."
Among specific issues, "bank stocks showed some resilience," noted John Blair, head trader at County NatWest. Citicorp rose 5/8 to 17 3/8, after Merrill Lynch upgraded its intermediate rating on the banking company. Lehman Brothers repeated "buy" ratings on several banks.
Chemical Banking rose 7/8 to 33 5/8; BankAmerica added 3/8 to 43 5/8, and Chase Manhattan gained 1 1/2, to 23 7/8. Wells Fargo jumped 1 1/4, to 69 1/8, after the billionaire publisher Walter Annenberg disclosed that he owned 5.3 percent of the company.
Novell lost 1 7/8, to 47 1/4. Merrill Lynch cut its intermediate-term rating on the company and fiscal year
Telefonos de Mexico slipped 7/8, to 45 3/8, on options-related selling. Charming Shoppes lost 1 1/8, to 30 1/2, as Alex. Brown downgraded its rating to "buy" from a "strong buy."
The Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks edged up 0.08, to 418.26. The American Stock Exchange index fell 0.02, to 385.87.
The New York Stock Exchange Composite eased 0.03, to 230.38. The average price per share was unchanged.
The Nasdaq index rose 0.25, to 567.86. The Wilshire Associates Equity Index -- which represents the market value of Big Board, American and Nasdaq issues -- was 4,027.37, down 0.66.

HEADLINE: IN THEIR OWN WORDS;
Transcript of Bush Speech Accepting the Nomination For Another Four Years

 BODY:
Following is the speech by President Bush to the Republican National Convention last night accepting the party's Presidential nomination, as transcribed by The New York Times.
Thank you very much, and I am proud to receive, and I'm honored to accept your nomination for President of the United States. 
 May I thank my dear friend and our great leader Bob Dole for that wonderful introduction. And let me say this: this nomination's not for me alone; it's for the ideas, principles and values that we stand for. And my job has been made easier by a leader who has taken a lot of unfair criticism, with grace and humor, the Vice President of the United States, Dan Quayle. And I am very grateful to him.
I want to talk tonight about the sharp choice that I intend to offer Americans this fall, a choice between different agendas, different directions, and, yes, a choice about the character of the man you want to lead this nation.
I know that Americans have many questions -- about our economy, about our country's future, even questions about me. And I'll answer them tonight.
And first, I feel great and I'm heartened, I'm heartened, by the polls, the ones that say that I look better in my jogging shorts than the Governor of Arkansas.
Four years ago, four years ago, I spoke about missions for my life and for our country. I spoke of one urgent mission: defending our security and promoting the American ideal abroad.
 
A World Transformed
 Just pause for a moment to reflect on what we've done.
Germany has united, and a slab of the Berlin wall sits right outside this Astrodome.
Arabs and Israelis now sit face-to-face and talk peace.
And every hostage held in Lebanon is free.
The conflicts, the conflict, in El Salvador is over, and free elections brought democracy to Nicaragua.
Black and white South Africans cheered each other at the Olympics.
The Soviet Union can only be found in history books.
The captive nations of Eastern Europe and the Baltics are captive no more.
And today, and today, on the rural streets of Poland, merchants sell cans of air labeled "the last breath of Communism."
If I had stood, if I had stood before you four years ago and described this as the world we would help to build, you would have said, "George Bush, you must have been smoking something, and you must have inhaled."
This convention is the first at which an American President can say the cold war is over, and freedom finished first.
 
Democrats vs. Republicans
 We have a lot to be proud of. A lot. Some want to rewrite history, want to skip over the struggle, claim the outcome was inevitable. And while the U.S. postwar strategy was largely bipartisan, the fact remains that the liberal, McGovern wing of the other party, including my opponent, consistently made the wrong choices.
In the 70's, they wanted a hollow army. We wanted a strong fighting force. In the 80's -- and you remember this one -- in the 80's they wanted a nuclear freeze, and we insisted on peace through strength.
From Angola to Central America, they said, "Let's negotiate, deliberate, procrastinate." And we said, "Just stand up for freedom."
And now the cold war is over, and they claim, "Hey, we were with you all the way." Their behavior, really, their behavior reminds me of the old con man's advice to the new kid. He said, "Son, if you're being run out of town, just get out in front and make it look like a parade."
Make no mistake, make no mistake, the demise of Communism wasn't a sure thing. It took the strong leadership of Presidents from both parties, including Republicans like Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan. And without their vision and the support of the American people, the Soviet Union would be a strong superpower today and we'd be facing a nuclear threat tonight.
 
Defense of Foreign Policy
 My opponents say I spend too much time on foreign policy.
As if it didn't matter that schoolchildren once hid under their desks in drills to prepare for nuclear war. I saw the chance to rid our children's dreams of the nuclear nightmare, and I did. Over the past four years, more people have breathed the fresh air of freedom than in all of human history. I saw a chance to help, and I did. And these were the two defining opportunities -- not of a year, not of a decade, but of an entire span of human history.
I seized those opportunities for our kids and our grandkids, and I make no apologies for that.
Now, the Soviet bear may be gone, but there are still wolves in the woods. And we saw that when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. The Mideast might have become a nuclear powder keg, our energy supplies held hostage.
So we did what was right and what was necessary. We destroyed a threat, freed a people and locked a tyrant in the prison of his own country.
Well, what about the leader of the Arkansas National Guard, the man who hopes to be commander in chief? Well, while I bit the bullet, and he bit his nails.
And two days -- listen to this now -- two days after Congress followed my lead, my opponent said this, and I quote directly: "I guess I would have voted with the majority if it was a close vote. But I agree with the arguments the minority made."
Now, sounds to me like his policy can be summed up by a road sign he has probably seen on his bus tour, "Slippery When Wet."
 
Who Will Lead?
 Look, look, this is serious business. Think about the impact of our foreign-policy failures the last time the Democrats controlled both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue: Gas lines, grain embargoes, American hostages blindfolded.
There will be more foreign-policy challenges like Kuwait in the next four years. Terrorists and aggressors to stand up to, dangerous weapons to be controlled and destroyed. And freedom's fight is not finished. And I look forward to being the first President to visit a free, democratic Cuba.
Who will lead the world? Who will lead the world in the face of these challenges? Not my opponent. In his acceptance speech he devoted just 65 seconds to telling us about the world.
And then he said that America was -- and I quote again -- I want to be fair and factual -- I quote, being "ridiculed" everywhere. Well tell that to the people around the world, for whom America is still a dream. Tell that to the leaders around the world, from whom America commands respect.
Ridiculed? Ridiculed? Tell that to the men and women of Desert Storm.
Let me, let me just make an aside comment here because of what you've been reading in the paper. This is a political year, but there's a lot of danger in the world. And you can be sure, I will never let politics interfere with a foreign-policy decision. Forget the election; I will do right -- what is right for the national security of the United States of America. And that is a pledge from my heart.
 
A Young Man's Decision
 Fifty years ago, 50 years ago this summer, I was 18 years of age. I see some young people in the audience tonight and I remember how I felt. And I believed deeply in this country, and we were faced with a world war. And so I made a decision, to go off and fight a battle much different from political battles.
And I was scared, but I was willing. I was young, but I was ready. I had barely lived, when I began to watch men die. I began to see the special place of America in the world, and I began to see, even then, that the world would become a much smaller place, and faraway places could become more and more like America.
And 50 years later, after change of almost biblical proportions, we know that when freedom grows, America grows. And just as a strong America means a safer world, we have learned that a safer world means a stronger America.
This election, this election is about change. But that's not unusual, because the American revolution is never ending. Today, the pace of change is accelerating. We face new opportunities and new challenges. And the question is, Who do you trust to make change work for you?
My opponent, my opponent says America is a nation in decline. Of our economy, he says, we are somewhere on the list beneath Germany, heading south toward Sri Lanka.
Well, don't let anyone tell you that America is second-rate, especially somebody running for President.
 
Good News and Bad
 Maybe he hasn't heard, maybe he hasn't heard that we are still the world's largest economy. No other nation sells more outside its borders. The Germans, the British, the Japanese can't touch the productivity of you, the American worker and the American farmer.
My opponent, my opponent won't mention that. He won't remind you that interest rates are the lowest they've been in 20 years, and millions of Americans have refinanced their homes. And you just won't hear that inflation, the thief of the middle class, has been locked in a maximum-security prison.
And you don't hear much about this good news, because the media also tends to focus only on the bad. And when the Berlin wall fell, I half expected to see a headline: "Wall Falls, Three Border Guards Lose Jobs." And underneath it probably says: "Clinton Blames Bush."
You don't hear a lot about progress in America. So let me tell you about some good things we've done together.
Just two weeks ago, all three nations of North America agreed to trade freely from Manitoba to Mexico. And this will bring good jobs to Main Street U.S.A.
We passed the Americans with Disabilities Act, bringing 43 million people into the economic mainstream. And I must say, it is about time.
Our children will breathe easier because of our new clean-air pact.
We are rebuilding our roads, providing jobs for more than half a million Americans.
And we passed a child-care law, and we took a stand for family values by saying that when it comes to raising children, Government doesn't know best, parents know best.
I have fought against prejudice and anti-Semitism all my life. And I am proud that we strengthened our civil rights laws, and we did it without resorting to quotas.
And one more thing of vital importance to all. Today, cocaine use has fallen by 60 percent among young people. To the teen-agers, the parents and the volunteers who are helping us battle the scourge of drugs in America: we say thank you. Thank you from the bottom of our heart.
 
Challenge of the 90's
 Do I want to do more? You bet. Nothing hurts me more than to meet with soldiers home from the Persian Gulf, who can't find a job. Or workers who have a job, but worry that the next day will bring a pink slip. And what about parents who scrape and struggle to send their kids to college, only to find them back living at home, because they can't get work.
The world is in transition, and we are feeling that transition in our homes.
The defining challenge of the 90's is to win the economic competition, to win the peace.
We must be a military superpower, an economic superpower and an export superpower.
In this election, you'll hear two versions of how to do this. Theirs is to look inward and protect what we already have. Ours is to look forward, to open new markets, prepare out people to compete, to restore our social fabric -- to save and invest -- so we can win.
We believe that now that the world looks more like America, it is time for America to look more like herself.
And so we offer a philosophy that puts faith in the individual, not the bureaucracy. A philosophy that empowers people to do their best, so America can be at its best. In a world that is safer and freer, this is how we will build an America that is stronger, safer and more secure.
 
Attack on Congress
 We start with a simple fact: Government is too big and spends too much.
And I have asked Congress to put a lid on mandatory spending except Social Security. And I've proposed doing away with over 200 programs and 4,000 wasteful projects and to freeze all other spending.
The gridlock Democrat Congress said, "No."
So, beginning tonight, I will enforce the spending freeze on my own. And if Congress sends me a bill spending more than I asked for in my budget, I will veto it fast. Veto it fast. Faster than copies of Millie's book sold.
Now, Congress won't cut spending, but refuses to give the President the power to eliminate pork-barrel projects that waste your money. Forty-three Governors have that power. So I ask you, the American people, Give me a Congress that will give me the line-item veto.
Let me tell you about a recent battle fought with the Congress, a battle in which I was aided by Bob Michel and Bob Dole. This spring, I worked day and night to get two-thirds of the House members to approve a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution.
We almost had it, but we lost by just nine votes. Now listen how. Just before the vote, the liberal leaders of Congress convinced 12 members who cosponsored the bill to switch sides and vote no. Keep in mind, they voted against a bill they had already put their names on.
Something fishy is going on. And look at my opponent on this issue. Look at my opponent. He says he's for balanced budgets. But he came out against the amendment. He's like that on a lot of issues, first on one side, then the other. He's been spotted in more places than Elvis Presley.
After all these years, after all these years, Congress has become pretty creative at finding ways to waste your money. So we need to be just as creative at finding ways to stop them. And I have a brand new idea.
 
Looking at Taxes
 Taxpayers should be given the right to check a box on their tax returns, so that up to 10 percent of their payments can go for one purpose alone: To reduce the national debt.
But we also, but we also need to make sure -- we need to make sure -- that Congress doesn't just turn around and borrow more money, to spend more money. And so I will require that, for every tax dollar set aside to cut the debt, the ceilings on spending will be cut by an equal amount. And that way, that way, we will cut both debt and spending, and take a whack out of the budget deficit.
My feelings about Big Government come from my experience: I spent half my adult life in the private sector. My opponent has a different experience: he has been in government nearly all his life. His passion to expand government knows no bounds.
And he has already proposed -- and listen to this carefully -- he has already proposed $220 billion in new spending, along with the biggest tax increase in history, $150 billion. And that's just to start.
He says he wants to tax the rich, but, folks, he defines rich as anyone who has a job.
You've heard of the separations of powers. Well, my opponent practices a different theory: "The power of separations." Government has the power to separate you from your wallet.
Now let me say this: When it comes to taxes, I've learned the hard way.
There's an old saying: "Good judgment comes from experience, and experience comes from bad judgment."
Two years ago, I made a bad call on the Democrats' tax increase. I underestimated Congress's addiction to taxes. And with my back against the wall, I agreed to a hard bargain: One tax increase one time, in return for the toughest spending limits ever.
Well, it was a mistake to go along with the Democratic tax increase. And I admit it.
But here's the question for the American people. Who do you trust in this election? The candidate who's raised taxes one time and regrets it, or the other candidate who raised taxes and fees 128 times, and enjoyed it every time?
 
Proposals for Congress
 When the new Congress convenes next January, I'll propose to further reduce taxes across the board, provided we pay for these cuts with specific spending reductions that I consider appropriate, so that we do not increase the deficit. I will also continue to fight to increase the personal exemption and to create jobs by winning a cut in capital gains taxes.
That will especially help small businesses. You know they create two-thirds of the new jobs in America. But my opponent's plan for small business is clear, present -- and dangerous. Beside new income taxes, his plan will lead to a new payroll tax to pay for a Government takeover of health care, and another new tax to pay for training. And that is just the beginning.
And if he gets his way, hardware stores all across America will have a new sign up: "Closed for despair." And I guess you'd say his plan really is "Elvis economics:" America will be checking into the "Heartbreak Hotel."
I believe that small business needs relief -- from taxation, regulation, and litigation.
And thus I will extend for one year the freeze on paperwork and unnecessary Federal regulation that I imposed last winter. There is no reason, there is no reason, that Federal regulations should live longer than my friend George Burns. I will issue an order to get rid of any rule whose time has come, and gone.
 
Clinton and Lawyers
 And I see something happening in our towns and in our neighborhoods. Sharp lawyers are running wild. Doctors are afraid to practice medicine. And some moms and pops won't even coach Little League any more. We must sue each other less, and care for each other more. I am fighting to reform our legal system, to put an end to crazy lawsuits. And if that means climbing into the ring with the trial lawyers, well, let me just say, Round 1 starts tonight.
After all, my opponent's campaign is being backed by practically every trial lawyer who ever wore a tasseled loafer. He's not in the ring with them, he's in the tank.
There are other things we need to do to get our economy up to speed and prepare our kids for the next century.
We must have new incentives for research and new training for workers. Small businesses need capital and credit, and defense workers need new jobs.
And I have a plan to provide affordable health care for every American, controlling costs by cutting paperwork and lawsuits, and expanding coverage to the poorest of the poor.
We do not need my opponent's plan for a massive Government takeover of health care, which would ration care and deny you the right to choose a doctor. Who wants health-care, who wants health care with a system with the efficiency of the House post office and the compassion of the KGB?
What about our schools? What about our schools? My opponent and I both want to change the way our kids learn. He wants to change our schools a little bit, and I want to change them a lot.
Take the issue of whether parents should be able to choose the best school for their kids. My opponent says that's O.K., as long as the school is run by Government. And I say every parent and child should have a real choice of schools -- public, private or religious.
So we have a clear choice to fix our problems. Do we turn to the tattered blanket of bureaucracy that other nations are tossing away? Or do we give our people the freedom and incentives to build security for themselves?
 
'The Blame Game
 Here's what I'm fighting for: open markets for American products, lower government spending, tax relief, opportunities for small business, legal and health reform, job training and new schools built on competition, ready for the 21st century.
Now, O.K. Why are these proposals not in effect today?
Only one reason: the gridlock Democratic Congress.
Now, I know Americans are tired of the blame game, tired of people in Washington acting like they are candidates for the next episode of "American Gladiators."
I don't like it either. Neither should you. But the truth is the truth. Our policies have not failed; they haven't been tried.
Americans want jobs. On Jan. 28, I put before Congress a plan to create jobs. And if it had been passed back then, 500,000 more Americans would be at work right now. But in a nation that demands action, Congress has become the master of inaction.
And it wasn't always this way. I heard President Ford tonight. I served in Congress 22 years ago under him. And back then, we cooperated; we didn't get personal. We put the people above everything else. Heck, we didn't even own blowdryers back in those days.
At my first inauguration I said that people didn't send us to bicker. I extended my hand -- and I think the American people know this -- I extended my hand to the Congressional leaders, the Democratic leaders, and they bit it.
And the House leadership, the House leadership has not changed in 38 years. It is a body caught in a hopelessly tangled web of PACs, perks, privileges, partisanship and paralysis. Every day, every day, Congress puts politics ahead of principle and above progress.
 
Congress and Clinton
 Now let me give you just one example. Feb. 20, 1991. It was at the height of the gulf war. On that very same day, I asked American pilots to risk their lives to fly missions over Baghdad. And I also wanted to strengthen our economic security for the future. So that very same day, I introduced a new domestic energy strategy which would cut our dependence on foreign oil by seven million barrels a day.
How many days did it take to win the gulf war? Forty-three. How many did it take Congress to pass a national energy strategy? Five hundred and thirty-two -- and still counting.
I have ridden stationary bikes that can move faster than the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate controlled by the Democrat leadership.
Where does my opponent stand with Congress? Well, up in New York at their convention, they kept the Congressional leaders away from the podium, hid them away. They didn't want America to hear from the people who really make the decisions.
And they hid them for a very good reason -- because the American people would recognize a dangerous combination: a rubber-check Congress and a rubber-stamp President.
Governor Clinton and Congress know that you've caught on to their lingo. They know when they say "spending" you say "oh, oh." So now they have a new word, "investment." They want to "invest" $220 billion more of your money, but I want you to keep it.
Governor Clinton and Congress want to put through the largest tax increase in history, but I will not let that happen.
And Governor Clinton and Congress don't want kids to have the option of praying in school, but I do. Clinton and Congress don't want to close legal loopholes and keep criminals behind bars, but I will. Clinton and Congress will stack the judiciary with liberal judges who write laws they can't get approved by the voters.
Governor Clinton even says Mario Cuomo belongs on the Supreme Court.
Now, wait a minute though. Now wait. Maybe not a bad idea.
If you believe, if you believe in judicial restraint, you probably ought to be happy. After all, the good Governor of New York can't make up his mind between chocolate and vanilla at Baskin Robbins. If he's there, we won't have another court decision for 35 years. And maybe that's all right, too.
 
The Carter Years
 Are my opponent and Congress really in cahoots? Look at one important question: Should we limit the terms of Congress? Governor Clinton says no. Congress says no. And I say yes.
We tried this. Look, we tried this once before, combining the Democratic Governor of a small Southern state with a very liberal Vice President and a Democratic Congress. America does not need "Carter 2."
We do not want to take America back to those days of malaise. But Americans want to know, Where's proof that we will have better days in Washington?
I'll give you 150 reasons, and that's how many members of Congress are expected to leave Washington this year. Some are tainted by scandal; the voters have bounced them the way they bounced their own checks. But others are good members, Republican and Democrat. And they agree with me: The place just doesn't work any more.
A 150 new members, from both parties, will be coming to Washington this fall. And every one will have a fresh view of America's future.
And I pledge today to the American people, immediately after this election, I will meet with every one of these members, before they get attacked by the PAC's, overwhelmed by their staffs and cornered by some camera crew. And I will lay out my case, for change. Change that matters, real change that makes a difference. Change that is right for America.
 
Change and Values
 You see, there is a yearning in America, a feeling that maybe it's time to get back to our roots.
Sure we must change, but some values are timeless. I believe in families that stick together fathers who stick around. And I happen to believe very deeply in the worth of each individual human being, born or unborn. And I believe in teaching our kids the difference between what's wrong and what's right, teaching them respect for hard work and to love their neighbors. And I believe that America will always have a special place in God's heart, as long as He has a special place in ours. And maybe that's why I've always believed that patriotism is not just another point of view.
There are times in every young person's life when God introduces you to yourself. And I remember such a time. It was back many years ago, when I stood watch at 4 A.M. Up on the bridge of a submarine, the United States Finback, U.S.S. Finback. And I would stand there and look out on the blackness of the sky, broken only by the sparkling stars above. And I would think about friends I lost, a country I loved and about a girl named Barbara. And I remember, I remember those nights as clearly as any in my life.
You know, you can see things from up there that other people don't see. You can see storm clouds rise and then disappear. The first hint of the sun over the horizon and the first outline of the shore faraway.
Now, I know Americans are uneasy today. There is anxious talk around our kitchen tables. But from where I stand, I see not American's sunset, but a sunrise.
And the world changes for which we've sacrificed for a generation have finally come to pass and with them a rare and unprecedented opportunity to pass the sweet cup of prosperity around our American table.
Are we up to it? I know we are.
As I travel our land, I meet veterans who once worked the turrets of a tank and can now master the keyboards of high-tech economy. I see teachers, blessed with the incredible American capacity for innovation, who are teaching our children a new way to learn for a new century. And I meet parents, some working two jobs with hectic schedules, who still find new ways to teach old values to steady their kids in a turbulent world.
 
Appealing to America's Spirit
 And I take heart from what is happening in America, not from those who profess a new passion for Government, but from those with an old and enduring faith in the human potential. Those who understand that the genius of America is our capacity for rebirth and renewal. America is the land where the sun is always peeking over the horizon.
And tonight I appeal to the unyielding, undying, undeniable American spirit. I ask you to consider, now that the entire world is moving our way, why would we want to go back their way? I ask not just for your support for my agenda, but for your commitment to renew and rebuild our nation by shaking up one institution that has withstood change for over four decades.
Join me in rolling away the roadblock, join me in rolling away the roadblock at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, so that in the next four years, we will match our accomplishments outside by building a stronger, safer, more secure America inside.
Forty-four years ago, in another age of uncertainty, a different President embarked on a similar mission. His name was Harry S. Truman.
And as he stood before his party to accept their nomination, Harry Truman knew the freedom I know this evening, the freedom to talk about what's right for America and let the chips fall where they may.
Harry Truman said this: "This is more than a political call to arms. Give me your help, not to win votes alone, but to win this new crusade and keep America safe and secure for its own people.
Well, tonight I say to you, Join me in our new crusade to reap the rewards of our global victory, to win the peace, so that we may make America safer and stronger for all our people.
May God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much.

The Economy
William Taylor, the F.D.I.C. chairman, died following colon surgery.

HEADLINE: Bank Fee Is in Doubt After Death at F.D.I.C.

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 20

 BODY:
William Taylor, one of the nation's senior banking regulators, died today. The death of the widely respected chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation raised serious concerns in Washington about the direction of the agency in the next few months as it is headed by an interim chairman.
Lawmakers and senior Administration officials said today that Mr. Taylor's death had robbed the agency of its influential leader just as it embarks on an important period of writing new regulations. In particular, it throws into doubt his plan to increase the insurance premiums that banks and savings associations pay to protect depositors. 
 The increase, an average of 22 percent, was tentatively approved in May on a 3-to-2 vote by the F.D.I.C. board and was to go into effect in January after a final vote next month. Mr. Taylor cast the swing vote.
He died this morning at a hospital in Fairfax, Va., from complications of colon surgery last week. [Obituary, page A22.]
 
Increase Likely to Be Blocked
 With no sign of any board member's changing his vote, the increase is now considered likely to be blocked by a tie vote next month, although some officials predicted today that the agency might approve a significantly smaller rise. A new chairman, even if named by President Bush this fall, is unlikely to be confirmed by the Senate until next year.
Andrew C. Hove Jr., who is now the acting chairman of the agency, said, "I just don't know what will happen" with the premium. As vice chairman in May, he cast his vote with Mr. Taylor. "It's an issue we are going to have to deal with on Sept. 1," he said.
Fearful that a large taxpayer bailout of the banks will be necessary if the industry does not pay more, the chairmen of the two banking committees in Congress, Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, Democrat of Texas, and Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., Democrat of Michigan, urged a rate increase upon the agency.
In his 10 months at the agency, Mr. Taylor made the restoration of the insolvent bank insurance fund his primary mission.
But the Administration and many banks hoped to block the premium rise because it would have a broad economic impact, making banking more expensive for customers, who would have to pay more for loans and receive lower yields on deposits. It would also hurt the stockholders of about 14,500 banks and savings associations, reducing the industry's after-tax earnings by more than 4 percent. Some of the premium costs are also borne by taxpayers, because institutions are permitted to write off a percentage of their premium payments on their corporate taxes.
In May, Mr. Taylor and two board members of the F.D.I.C. tentatively approved the plan to raise premiums by an average of 22 percent beginning in January, and also make fundamental changes in the way those premiums are assessed. For the first time since 1934, when the initial fund was set up in the wake of the bank collapses of the Great Depression, weaker institutions would pay a bigger increase than stronger ones.
Two other board members, who are also officials of the Treasury Department, dissented and went along with the Administration's view that such a steep increase was not necessary. Those officials are T. Timothy Ryan Jr., head of the Office of Thrift Supervision, and Stephen R. Steinbrink, Acting Comptroller of the Currency. Hours after the vote in May on the premium increase, Mr. Steinbrink said in an interview that he would have approved a smaller rise in the rates.
A final vote on the premium proposal is scheduled for Sept. 1, and if the remaining four board members vote as they did a few weeks ago, the measure will be defeated.
The bank insurance fund lost about $11 billion last year, giving it a deficit of about $7 billion that it has had to borrow from the Treasury. It has predicted possibly greater losses in the next two years.
The proposed changes would raise an additional $1.25 billion annually. It would raise premiums to an average of 28 cents for every $100 in deposits, from the current 23 cents. The weakest banks, those with the least capital and the most problem loans, would pay an additional 3 cents for every $100 in deposits, and the strongest would pay 3 cents less.
The bank insurance fund, which stood at $18.3 billion six years ago, has been battered by the failures of 885 banks since then, costing more than $26 billion. While assessments have nearly tripled, from 8.3 cents per $100 just three years ago to the current 23 cents, they have failed to keep pace with the devastation of the industry.
In recent months, the deposit insurance corporation has dramatically slowed the number of banks it has seized, citing favorable interest rates that have temporarily helped weak banks. But the agency has been ordered by Congress to change its policy and begin in December to seize weak, though solvent, institutions, on the theory that it is cheaper to rescue banks if they are taken over before they become insolvent.
Mr. Taylor's death leaves the agency in the hands of Mr. Hove probably until sometime next year. No one expects a permanent replacement to be appointed by the White House and confirmed by the Senate before the next administration is in place and a new Congress comes to Washington in January.
Mr. Hove, a 57-year-old former mayor of Minden, Neb., where he also was a banker, said today in a brief meeting in his office with reporters that he would move to carry on the agenda set by Mr. Taylor.
"Perhaps the best tribute we can give Bill Taylor is to continue his agenda," Mr. Hove said. He said the two top priorities for the agency continued to be to nurse the bank insurance fund back to health and "improve the safety and soundness" of the industry.
He appeared to be shaken by the news of Mr. Taylor's death and awkward about meeting with reporters on the same day to discuss the future of the agency.
Mr. Hove arrived in Washington two years ago and is known to his friends as Skip. On the most important votes this year he sided with Mr. Taylor and against the Bush Administration's two representatives on the F.D.I.C. board, although some lobbyists today predicted that the agency would be yielding some of its independence to the Treasury Department.
Normally directed by a five-member board, the F.D.I.C. will now be run by four members -- two of whom are officials in the Treasury Department and two others whose terms expire in February.
"It's a lame-duck board," said Kenneth Guenther, executive vice president and top lobbyist for the Independent Bankers Association of America. "The bottom line is the F.D.I.C. will be run by the Treasury."

HEADLINE: POLITICS AND FAMILY: SOUTHERN WOMEN - Voices of Women in the 'Family Values' Debate: a Sampling, North and South;
In Atlanta, the Message Strikes Chord, but Not With All

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Aug. 20

 BODY:
Sue Weidert is all for family values. She loves Barbara Bush. She thinks Mrs. Bush made important points Wednesday when the Republicans put on a full-court press to lure female voters.
But if the election were today, she would vote for Bill Clinton for President. 
 "I like Mrs. Bush," said Ms. Weidert, who was interviewing for a job in downtown Atlanta today. "I'm very disappointed in President Bush. I like what Mrs. Bush said about family values, and I think it's very important, but I wouldn't vote for anybody just because of that. It's an issue, but not the only issue by any means."
Interviews with more than two dozen women in this city that combines the social conservatism and economic dynamism of a changing South found them divided on the family-values appeal made by Marilyn Quayle and Barbara Bush at the Republican National Convention on Wednesday night. Roughly half found the evening heartwarming and appealing; the remainder found it cynical and irrelevant.
 
Not the Deciding Factor
 But nearly all said their vote would be based on something other than the Bush's show of family unity or Mrs. Quayle's views of a wife's proper role.
Several women interviewed here said Wednesday's focus on women and family issues was probably a good idea, especially because of the sour taste several cited from the hard-edged tone of much of the convention, particularly in the Monday speech by Patrick J. Buchanan, the former Republican Presidential challenger.
"I haven't had the stomach to watch any of the convention since Buchanan's speech," said Roberta Newberry, owner of a court reporting service. "He made me ill. I may have to vote Democratic for the first time in my life."
Indeed, preliminary poll results suggest the convention's beginning may have had more success with men than women. A New York Times/CBS News poll of 1,022 registered voters nationwide taken Aug. 11-14 showed Mr. Clinton with a 17-percentage-point lead, including a 19-point lead among men and a 15-point lead among women.
 
Mrs. Bush? Loved Her.
 A CBS News poll of 1,204 registered voters nationwide taken Tuesday and Wednesday showed a 9-point Clinton lead, with a 7-point lead among men and a 10-point lead among women.
The interviews today, most conducted at a downtown office complex and a suburban mall today, indicated that many women reacted positively to Wednesday night's speeches, particularly the one given by Mrs. Bush.
"I love what she said about family values, going back to the more traditional values I grew up with," said Mary Salvadori, who runs a downtown hair salon with her husband.
To some, the evening was revealing. "It showed me that they were somewhat more interested in women than you seem to get the impression they are," said Kendall Campbell, who recently stopped working as an interior designer to care for her newborn son.
But several women interviewed found the evening irrelevant or worse. "They talk about family values, but it's really just a way to bash the other guys and cover up what they haven't done on the real issues," said Lindy Barnett.
To some, the moral issues and talk about family values are anything but a distraction.
Jean Shumaker, shopping with her 2-year-old daughter Jenny at Cumberland Mall in suburban Cobb County, said: "I definitely know that no one is better to raise a child than that child's mother. I know some women have to work, and I appreciate that. But if the reason is to have two cars and a nice house, that's something else."
But to others family values is something much more complex than the Republicans make it out to be.
Candace Wiggins, a freelance proofreader and writer working for a local law firm, said the remarks by Mrs. Quayle and former Education Secretary William J. Bennett, were an "offensive" attempt to evoke a outdated world of working fathers and stay-at-home moms that most families can't afford even if they want to.
"It was totally out of touch with reality," she said. "It was all a white-bread world. Well, we're wheat toast now. Give me some fiber."

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: ROSS PEROT;
Pay, Not Perot, Lures Workers In Ballot Effort

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
Petition-gatherers for Ross Perot were out in force in midtown Manhattan yesterday, part of the disavowed Presidential candidate's continuing effort to get his name on the November ballot in all 50 states.
But the workers were not some of the thousands of volunteers who had labored for Mr. Perot around the country until he unexpectedly withdrew from contention last month. These workers were being paid $10 an hour. 
 Patricia Cox, a 21-year-old college student collecting petitions at 49th Street and Fifth Avenue, said she had been hired "through an agency, as a temp." Another worker, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he had been unemployed for two years. "I needed the work," he said.
A Perot spokeswoman in Dallas, Sharon Holman, said volunteers were still gathering petitions in eight states, including New York, in the quest to get their candidate on the ballot in all 50 states. "At this moment, Mr. Perot's on the ballot in 36 states," Ms. Holman said. "There are an additional seven states -- actually those seven include the District of Columbia -- that have turned in their petitions and are awaiting certification."
The remaining eight states where petitions are still being gathered, she said, are New York, Wisconsin, New Mexico, Arizona, Hawaii, Louisiana, Mississippi and Vermont.
"Mr. Perot had encouraged those who were collecting signatures to complete the process," Ms. Holman said. "By staying together, they can be a very powerful force. They will be the swing vote that will force the other two parties to pay attention to Mr. Perot's economic plan. His No. 1 hope is that one or the other candidates will embrace an economic plan that will make sense."
Ms. Holman said she was unaware that petition-gatherers in New York were being paid, and insisted that none in other states were receiving money. Petition-gatherers in Manhattan yesterday knew little about who had hired them, and no one answered a telephone call placed to the number listed in a classified advertisement in Wednesday's New York Times seeking paid Perot campaign workers.
The telephone number given is for the campaign headquarters of Abraham Hirschfeld, a real estate developer who is seeking the Democratic nomination to run against Representative Bill Green, a Manhattan Republican.
Ms. Holman said she did not know Mr. Hirschfeld, and Mr. Hirschfeld could not be reached for comment.
A petition-gatherer near Rockefeller Center, Eudowa Vincent, 25, of Queens Village, Queens, said yesterday that other workers fanned out in Greenwich Village, at Pennsylvania Station and Wall Street as well as in parts of Brooklyn on Long Island and upstate.
Mr. Perot's former New York campaign chairman, Matthew Lifflander, who is now working for the campaign of Gov. Bill Clinton, the Democratic Presidential nominee, said: "The sad thing here is that after having these thousands of wonderful volunteers across the state who broke their hearts and gave their energy free of charge, now he's left with only those that he can buy, by paying to have the petitions carried.
"It's a double tragedy, because he still has a lot of good, substantitve ideas that people ought to be paying attention to," Mr. Lifflander added.

HEADLINE: D'Amato Criticizes G.O.P. Over Emphasis on Family Values

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK

 BODY:
Heading into a bruising re-election battle this fall in New York, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato took a clearly calculated swipe at his own party yesterday, saying the Republicans had focused far too intensely on "family values" and had failed to address voters' concerns about the economy in great enough depth.
"I don't think any party has a corner on family values, and I don't think that any party should claim that it has one," Mr. D'Amato said in an interview at the Republican National Convention in Houston. "What we should do is talk about programs that will help a family with real challenges, whether it is a traditional family or a single-parent family." 
 Senator D'Amato insisted that his stance merely reflected his disappointment with the tone of the convention. "It's got nothing to do with any election," he said.
But the comments also indicated a need to distance himself from a platform that would represent a severe political liability in New York, even though it might play well in more conservative parts of the nation.
Mr. D'Amato's comments came as the Senate campaign, which has proceeded quietly for the last several months, is taking a much noisier -- and nastier -- turn on the Democratic side, where four candidates are vying for the right to oppose Senator D'Amato in the November general election.
Yesterday, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo issued a rebuke to two of the candidates, Elizabeth Holtzman, the New York City Comptroller, and Robert Abrams, the State Attorney General, for barraging former Representative Geraldine A. Ferraro with what they said were unanswered questions about her and her husband's finances and possible dealings with members of organized crime. He called their tactics "gutter politics."
"He who lives by the accusation dies by the accusation," Mr. Cuomo said in an interview. "It's damaging, it's destructive and this will not help any of them defeat Senator D'Amato."
Ms. Holtzman fired back a two-page letter by facsimile machine to the Governor, detailing a history of Ms. Ferraro's husband's rental of commercial space to a Mafia-linked pornography company.
"If a Democratic candidate is unable to take the 'sleaze factor' right to D'Amato's doorstep, then voters need to know that before the primary, not in October, when it's too late," she told the Governor.
Mr. D'Amato's remarks seemed to represent the evolution of a strategy begun months ago, in which the Senator has tried to distance himself from President Bush's economic policies.
"To get re-elected in this state, he's going to need, in all likelihood, to get more votes than Bush does," said Hank Morris, a frequent consultant to Democratic candidates. "He's got to send a message to Democrats because there are a lot of people in New York who might have been rubbed the wrong way by what Pat Buchanan had to say at the convention."
While Mr. D'Amato has remained a consistent foe of abortion except in cases of rape, incest and where the life of the pregnant woman is at stake, Mr. D'Amato declined in a telephone interview to say whether he had any opinion on other issues that some Republicans have raised as a litmus test for family values.
 
Domestic Partners
 For instance, when asked how he felt about various proposals to confer legal recognition, including shared health benefits, on same-sex couples who register as domestic partners, Mr. D'Amato replied: "I'm not going to get involved in it. I'm not opposed to it and I'm not in favor of it."
Asked whether same-sex couples should be allowed to marry, a policy some Republicans have derisively raised as a possible Democratic initiative, Mr. D'Amato said this was for churches to decide before governments, or senators, should.
And while both Marilyn Quayle and Barbara Bush emphasized the value of mothers deciding to stay home with young children, Mr. D'Amato noted in the interview that he expected that his daughter would be continuing her career as an industrial engineer even as she raises two children. "I wouldn't take any offense at that," he said.
In general, Mr. D'Amato was critical of Republican strategists for what he said was "all the hype" about Mrs. Bush's speech Wednesday night. "All the aides and campaign strategists who said it was going to be 'family values night' actually undercut a very stirring presentation by the First Lady," he said.
Other Republicans at the convention echoed Mr. D'Amato's theme, though many, like Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts or former Gov. Thomas H. Kean of New Jersey, were generally viewed as more liberal than he is to begin with. Representative Susan Molinari of New York said, "I really think that my constituents only wanted one answer from this convention and from the Democrats' convention and that is how are you going to fix the economy so that I know I'll keep my job?"
 
A Critical Juncture
 On the Democratic side, the allegations about Ms. Ferraro that have been raised by Ms. Holtzman and Mr. Abrams are clearly creating a critical juncture in the primary campaign. The major question is whether suggestions of ethical weaknesses on her part will diminish her standing as the front-runner or whether she will be able to capitalize on her strategy of portraying herself as a sympathetic victim of ethnic smears.
A similar strategy in 1984 helped her defuse controversy over her finances as she campaigned for Vice President but also left a perception that she had never addressed some of the questions head on.
Her strategy was much in evidence yesterday as Ms. Ferraro assailed her opponents and released a list of new endorsements from politicians, including Representatives Jose E. Serrano, Thomas J. Downey, Matthew F. McHugh and Robert J. Mrazek, many of whom criticized Mr. Abrams and Ms. Holtzman.
But both Ms. Holtzman and Mr. Abrams said that in all her professed outrage, Ms. Ferraro had resisted many of their questions and demands that she release tax records.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Plummets to Reach Lowest Level Against Mark

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
As President Bush prepared to deliver his acceptance speech to the Republican National Convention in Houston, the American dollar closed yesterday in New York at its lowest level ever against the mark.
The dollar was at 1.447 against the mark in late trading, slipping under the previous record low of 1.4475 set in February 1991. 
 "The weak dollar reflects the market perception that the U.S. economy continues to be weak and, in addition, the political uncertainty of the campaign," John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers in New York, said.
The dollar's decline began in force this spring, as chances disappeared for a strong economic recovery, which would have attracted foreign investment. In addition, the gap between the high interest rates in Germany and Europe and the declining interest rates in the United States has widened, making investments in dollar-denominated securities expensive and unappealing.
In other currency trading yesterday, the dollar eased against the yen, closing at 126.52, compared with 126.58 Wednesday. It may be that only Japan's current economic crisis is preventing the dollar from falling to new lows against the yen. The dollar also fell against European currencies.
The fall against the mark yesterday was not dramatic because the dollar has been weak for some time. Like a sick patient, it just gently slipped to this record as its doctors -- the Governments of the United States and of its economic allies -- watched at the bedside. Twice in the last month, the Federal Reserve and central banks from America's economic allies have intervened in concert to support the dollar before it fell to a new low. Today they did not.
The decline could be inopportune for Mr. Bush, if his Democratic opponent, Bill Clinton, choses to point to the declining dollar as a symbol of a weakened American economy and leadership.
The decline has already been tough on Americans abroad, as their vacation costs have soared, while the dollar fell -- 11.5 percent against the mark since the end of April and similar amounts against other European currencies.
The first dollar support effort came July 20 as the dollar once again neared its low against the mark, which was created in 1948. The massive intervention, in which the Fed and more than 10 other central banks bought dollars to lift the currency's value, surprised traders, and the dollar rose.
Since then it has drifted back down, but only cautiously, showing traders were wary of more intervention. If it comes swiftly and unexpectedly, it can result in large trading losses.
The Federal Reserve intervened alone in early August; then the Fed and other central banks joined in another major intervention Aug. 11. But these moves had less impact because they were expected.
Some traders were surprised that the Fed and other central banks did not intervene yesterday. "It makes one wonder if they think it is important to defend the dollar," said Christopher S. Bourdain of Credit Suisse in New York.
Mr. Bourdain noted that because traders are not aggressively selling dollars, intervention might not be that effective. Yet there is likely to be a lot more supportive intervention soon because if the central banks wait too long, the dollar could drop suddenly, shaking confidence around the world and bring the American stock and bond markets down with it.
But in the longer term, the problem for the dollar -- and the Bush Administration during a tough election -- is that intervention can be effective only for a short time. Economic policy changes are necessary to give the dollar real support. But the changes that would be needed -- the lowering of interest rates in Germany and the rest of Europe and an increase in interest rates here -- are out of the question right now.

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: NEWS ANALYSIS;
In Economic Plan of '92, Bush Avoids Trap of '88

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Aug. 20

 BODY:
This time, no one will be able to blame President Bush for breaking his promises about the economy at the Republican convention. They are simply too vague, not even remotely resembling the "read my lips: no new taxes" pledge he made four years ago in New Orleans.
He said tonight that if he was re-elected, he would propose tax reductions across the board. But he never said which taxes would be lowered, and he made the pledge contingent on offsetting spending reductions. 
 He said he would place a cap on "mandatory spending." But an overall cap could not work until a spending lid was put on the individual programs -- Medicare, Medicaid, veterans' benefits and the like. Otherwise, one program could gobble up all the money and eventually there would be none left for the others. But Mr. Bush did not say tonight and has never said before what those particular limits should be.
He said he would veto any appropriation bill that exceeded his budget request. During Mr. Bush's Presidency, he and Congress have often disagreed on how much to spend for what, but all told, Congress has voted less money than the President asked for. Mr. Bush has never vetoed a bill on the ground it was too expensive.
 
Facing Reality
 Basically, the President tonight faced up to reality, political reality and economic reality.
On the politics, his party is divided. Some, like Housing Secretary Jack F. Kemp, favor deep tax cuts to stimulate the economy, the budget deficit be damned. Others, like Senator Phil Gramm of Texas and Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, believe the top priority is to bring the deficit under control.
If the President had come down firmly, he would have risked alienating one side or the other. So he straddled.
Furthermore, the Democratic Congress is lying in wait. Almost every specific tax reduction Mr. Bush has offered since he took office proved directly more beneficial to the rich than to the middle class or the poor. That would certainly be true of the two he suggested in general terms tonight: a lower capital gains tax and a higher personal exemption.
The Democrats would like nothing more than to take a specific tax-cut proposal before the election, run it through the computers of the Joint Tax Committee and put out charts portraying the President as the patron of fat cats. By being vague, the President took away that opportunity.
As for the economic reality, Mr. Bush apologized tonight for signing the tax increase in 1990. But he made no apology for the recession.
 
Paying Off 1980's Debts
 Actually, there is precious little that President Bush could do to prevent the recession or stimulate the economy, especially in the short run. So from that perspective, most economists do not hold Mr. Bush responsible for the weakness in the economy during his term.
Mainly, the economy has been stagnant because the country has been paying off the debts that were accrued in the 1980's -- the debts of companies, individuals and the Government. The fact is, most economists agree, the prosperity of the 1980's was borrowed from the 1990's.
In addition, the commercial real estate market collapsed largely because of tax-policy swings in the 1980's, and that has been bad for the construction industry. The collapse of communism led to less Government money for military contractors, and the weakness of the banks and savings and loan associations made for newly tightened lending practices.
 
An Unwanted Distinction
 But Mr. Bush is hardly in the position to make excuses or escape blame. He took so much credit for the prosperity of the Reagan years that he can hardly avoid being held accountable for what has happened since: the worst economic performance on balance of any Presidential term since World War II.
His acceptance speech four years ago is, of course, best remembered for the "no new taxes" line. But he also said then:
"Consider the size of our triumph: a record number of Americans at work, a record high percentage of our people with jobs . . . a high rate of new businesses, a record high rate of real personal income."
In Mr. Bush's term, fewer jobs have been created than in any other four-year term since the World War. More businesses have failed. Growth in after-tax personal income, adjusted for inflation, has been imperceptible.
Of course, Mr. Bush is not the only candidate with a vague economic program. Gov. Bill Clinton's proposals to cut the deficit are based largely on an exceedingly optimistic view of how much the economy will grow in the next few years. A large share of the additional revenue he hopes to bring in would come from foreign corporations who do business in this country. These companies do not vote. But they could withdraw their business in a way that might be devastating for Americans.
Still, Mr. Bush was simply wrong tonight when he said Mr. Clinton was proposing the biggest tax increase in history, $150 billion over four years. The tax law Ronald Reagan signed in 1982 raised taxes by $152 billion over four years. And when the $104 billion in tax cuts Mr. Clinton is proposing are subtracted from his proposed tax increases, the net increase is less than the net $107 billion tax rise Mr. Bush signed in 1990.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA AND THE MESSAGE: CAMPAIGN WATCH;
On TV, a Victory in Family Numbers

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT

 BODY:
George Bush may not be able to win the election against Bill Clinton on the economy. He may not even be able to win the fight over so-called family values. But there is one battle he wins definitively: the battle over family numbers.
Mr. Bush has a big family. Mr. Clinton has a small family. 
 Big families don't necessarily produce better leaders than small ones. But watching the President make a "surprise" appearance with his brood Wednesday night, one couldn't help noticing that the Bush family would have an easier time getting up a game of touch football on the White House lawn. And in the battle of television images that is so much of what conventions are about, impressions like this may count for a lot.
The show of Bush family solidarity came toward the end of prime-time Wednesday night, directly after Barbara Bush's address. It presented a triumphantly simple visual -- 23 family members -- for an evening that was otherwise fraught with tension. It was, in fact, the only moment of the evening when the phrase "family values" seemed to have a clear meaning.
 
Different Values
 By the time the President made his brief appearance on the stage, viewers watching the Republican convention on CNN, PBS and C-Span had heard rather conflicting accounts of "family values" from Pat Robertson, the television evangelist; Mary Fisher, the daughter of a prominent Republican fund raiser who is infected with the AIDS virus, and Marilyn Quayle, the wife of the Vice President.
Mr. Robertson's family values were those of a "traditional" family threatened by the Clintons and assorted "left-wingers." Ms. Fisher's were those of a "human" family threatened by ignorance and prejudice. And Mrs. Quayle's family values, it seems, were those of talented women who are not threatened by giving up their careers to stay home with the kids.
"Most women," Mrs. Quayle explained, "do not wish to be liberated from their essential natures as women."
Viewers who did not tune into the convention until the networks began their live coverage at 10 P.M. were spared most of these conflicting signals; they got their version of family values straight from Mrs. Bush. Integrity, responsibility, car pools, Little League games and the Fourth of July, viewers learned, figured prominently in the Bush family's life. But as far as the First Lady was concerned, it seemed, family values could be anything, preferably something that would make Americans vote for George Bush.
"However you define family," Mrs. Bush said, "that's what we mean by family values."
 
Big Looks Better
 By introducing not only her five children but also her 12 grandchildren after her speech, Mrs. Bush shifted the family competition to a level on which the Clintons simply cannot compete; their only daughter, Chelsea, is 12 years old. And viewers watching the extended Bush family link arms and wave to the crowd could not help but be impressed by what an attractive, all-American clan they are. (On a mischievous note, though, during Labor Secretary Lynn Martin's nominating speech, NBC repeatedly cut away to one Bush granddaughter wearing an off-the-shoulders and distinctly low-cut dress.)
Several television commentators noted the paradox of the Bush family special Wednesday night, coming on the heels of repeated Republican attacks on Hillary Clinton. Wasn't it hypocritical, they asked, for the party to call in Barbara Bush to shore up her husband while at the same time claiming it is Mrs. Clinton who wields too much influence?
If this troubled Mrs. Bush, however, she did not show it. Even after delivering one of the convention's most important addresses, she managed on television to maintain the air of a slightly addled grandmother whose major worry is that someone won't like her cooking.
"I don't think it was a very big role," she insisted when Maria Shriver of NBC asked her about her performance Wednesday night. "I thought Marilyn gave a great speech."
And if the Bush family appearance was carefully planned, the family's response to questions about its purpose was equally well managed.
"Was there an attempt in all that to contrast your family with the Clinton family?" Charles Gibson of ABC asked Mr. Bush's daughter, Dorothy Koch, this morning.
"I don't think so," she replied.

HEADLINE: POLITICS AND THE FAMILY: NORTHERN WOMEN - Voices of Women in the 'Family Values' Debate: a Sampling, North and South;
In New Jersey, The Reaction Is 'Show Me'

BYLINE: By MARY B. W. TABOR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MORRISTOWN, N.J., Aug. 20

 BODY:
Barbara Bush won praise for being warm and wonderful. Marilyn Quayle fared less well among those who listened to the speeches of both women at the Republican National Convention last night, though she won points for emphasizing "family values."
But in this central New Jersey town, the seat of a county where registered Republican voters outnumber Democrats 2 to 1, any political loyalties that Mrs. Bush inspired among women were clearly being put in check today. 
 "I think Barbara is really going to help President Bush in the polls," said Kay Smith, a mother of five who manages the Jewelry Box on the Town Green. "But he's going to have to do a lot more to show me that he's going to get our country back to where it should be, helping the homeless, people with AIDS, our poor, our economy."
 
Looking at Other Issues
 It was a refrain repeated again and again by women in this upscale Northeastern regional center that boomed in the 1980's with an influx of corporate offices. And the refrain transcended boundaries of race, class, family situation -- even political affiliations.
The women of Morris County, interviewed on park benches and offices, street corners and shops here, said that when the speeches ended they had been left wondering why Mrs. Bush and Mrs. Quayle were not talking more about subjects like abortion rights, health care and legislation to provide leaves for workers for family health needs, issues that women often have cited as influencing their votes.
As she sat on a bench on the Green, surrounding by children with dripping ice-cream cones, Catherine Cleffi, a 36-year-old part-time nurse, reflected on Mrs. Bush's speech. While it may have been short on political substance, she said, it was long on appeal.
"I didn't expect to hear much from her about heavy issues," said Mrs. Cleffi, who added that she was not sure how she would vote in November. "But I liked that she talked about the importance of taking care of children, about being there for them while they are growing up. She makes the title of homemaker have a little more respect."
 
Taking It Out on the TV
 Not everyone was so generous.
As Karen Holliday, an I.B.M. consultant, stood waiting for her lunch date near the Green, she looked up from her newspaper with little more than disdain when asked her response to the convention speeches.
"I like Barbara and I expected more of her," she said. "Marilyn's speech? That was even worse."
Ms. Holliday said she watched the speeches at home alone, and, annoyed at Mrs. Quayle's descriptions of liberals, had hurled the remote control at the television set.
"She reminds me of June Cleaver," Ms. Holliday growled. "I don't buy her at all. The whole convention should have been about educating Americans and giving us information about the issues."
Jacqueline M. Boyle, a 36-year-old district manager of Dress Barn, a women's clothing store, was equally vitriolic. "I don't think the Republicans are really for women," she said.
"It's fine and great to say all those things," Ms. Boyle said, referring to remarks about staying home with children and devotion to their husband's careers. "But the reality is that most women have to work."
 
Seeing a Need for Help
 Other women were more ambivalent.
Mary A. Cullen, an 82-year-old longtime Republican, tipped her hand from side to side to describe her feelings about the speeches and about President Bush. "I admire Mrs. Bush," she said. "But I don't like some of the things he's done."
Six years ago when she was newly widowed, Mrs. Cullen said, she was forced for financial reasons to sell her home and move into public housing, a hard move for a woman who had worked all of her life to help send her five children to college. Since then, she said, she had seen many families in need of improved social services.
"We need a lot of help right now in the U.S.," she said.
Maria H. Acevedo, a 25-year-old native of Colombia, said she watched the convention with her family, though she is not yet a citizen and cannot vote. She said she had not watched Mrs. Quayle's speech, but had liked Mrs. Bush's remarks with one caveat. She wanted to hear "more specifics" about what kind of "family values" Mrs. Bush talked about.
"I think that the family is the heart of the society and that the mother is the heart of the family," Miss Acevedo, a legal secretary, said. "And I think women should be more preoccupied with what is happening in the homes.
"I feel the same way about Mr. Bush: he should pay more attention to what is happening at home."

HEADLINE: In Downtown Syracuse, the Streets Get Emptier;
The Closing of the Last Department Store Causes the City to Try to Redefine Its Core

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SYRACUSE, Aug. 18

 BODY:
Some people say that Syracuse's proud old downtown began to die when Interstate 81 was built in the 1960's. Others think the suburban malls did it, each more grandiose than the one before, sucking stores and people from the city like so many vampires. Whatever the cause, Doris Smith now finds that her modest office building in the heart of downtown is half-empty and eerily quiet.
"It is very sad and very depressing," said Mrs. Smith, a receptionist for an advertising agency where the ground floor was vacated by yet another failed store just two weeks ago. "It's hard to bring any visitors into this city, because it doesn't look very good anymore." 
 On Monday, the last of Syracuse's big downtown department stores, Addis & Dey's, announced that it would shut for good on Saturday, saying it was no longer profitable to operate in a place where few people shop. With city leaders pouring money into downtown in an effort to build it up again, the closing of the store, which began as Dey Brothers more than 100 years ago, was particularly poorly timed.
 
A Downtown Era Ends
 However much the city is trying, its residents are keenly aware of the symbolism in the decision by Addis & Dey, once one of a half dozen large department stores downtown.
"With this store leaving it's going to make Syracuse dead, dead, dead," said Deborah Young, 29 years old, hunting for bargains at the store. "It's going to create a very big empty space here."
Syracuse's experience mirrors that of scores of small cities and big towns across the Northeast. Already irrevocably altered by the decades-long exodus of the population to the suburbs, downtowns everywhere have been doubly hit by the lingering recession, which has brought layoffs and devastated all vestiges of the traditional retail center of town.
In Newark, residents already demoralized by their dwindling downtown had more bad news earlier this year, when Macy's, the last holdout department store, closed. Other cities been able to put off what may be inevitable: faced with the shutdown of its own Macy's, New Haven recently managed to keep it open with a $12 million package of city and state grants to improve a parking garage, a tax freeze and reduced electricity rates.
"We've been affected by the same things that all midsize towns have been," said Joe C. Mareane, Syracuse's director of development. "The era of the giant department store is over in downtown."
In Syracuse, the seat of the Onondaga County government and a major banking and insurance center in upstate New York, between 3,000 and 4,000 downtown jobs -- about 10 to 15 percent of the work force -- have been lost since 1988, said Steven E. Shulman, vice president and project director of the Galleries of Syracuse, an office and retail center right next to Addis & Dey's.
That affects everything that used to make downtown prosperous: restaurants where the workers ate, stores where they shopped and office buildings where they worked. In a two-block radius in the core of downtown, some 400,000 square feet of space is vacant, said Thomas H. Greenwood, president of Greenwood Commercial-Investment Realtors in Syracuse. No new use has been planned for the Addis & Dey building either.
 
Vacancies at Main and Main
 To the 164,000 residents of Syracuse -- many of them elderly people and minorities left behind when others moved to the suburbs -- that means that from the heart of their community on South Salina and Jefferson, known locally as Main and Main, streets stretching out in any direction are now thick with "for rent" signs.
As the vacancies have made downtown more depressing, people have naturally been drawn to the dozen or so malls and shopping centers on Syracuse's outskirts. The latest and most spectacular of these is the Carousel Center, featuring more than 170 stores, its own post office, a glass-domed top, and an indoor carousel.
So glamorous is the mall that 30-year-old Estelle Acocella of Syracuse's north side recently took her out-of-town cousins there, instead of downtown. "There's no parking and no variety of stores downtown," she said, a bit sheepishly, holding a newly purchased satchel and watching her cousins and their children window-shopping nearby. "I might go downtown sometimes, but I wouldn't get out of the car to shop."
Addis & Dey already has several stores in malls, but its departure from downtown was a shock to the city, which had laid out more than $2.3 million to buy the building that houses the store, and was charging no rent, in an effort to get the store to stay.
The city is also in the midst of a $10 million campaign to widen sidewalks, plant hundreds of trees and replace the grim urban lights with more friendly street lamps. The city is also building a $96 million convention center and renovating a number of buildings downtown, all in the hopes of attracting businesses and people back to the area.
Syracuse, its leaders say, is coming around to the notion that the way to salvage downtown is not by building more retail giants, but by emphasizing other things -- museums and cultural attractions, for instance, or neighborhoods like Armory Square, a refurbished historic district of tony shops and restaurants that is flourishing just blocks from Salina Street.
 
City Officials Rethink
 Dennis J. Connors, executive director of the Onondaga Historical Association, said the city was just beginning -- a bit late, perhaps -- to figure out what it wanted to do with the downtown. Several years ago, for instance, the city pinned some hopes on the Galleries, a downtown mini-mall with soaring glass architecture and a mix of stores, offices and the county library. But the Galleries could hardly compete with the suburban mega-malls, and today, many of the stores are vacant.
"The city leaders are only beginning to recognize the fact that you can't beat the malls at their own game, that you must redefine downtown to make it unique," Mr. Connors said.
But it remains to be seen whether the new attractions, including a hands-on science museum and the convention center, will actually draw people back downtown. At Addis & Dey's this week, shoppers mourned the demise of a once-great store and said they could only worry about the future.
"They're trying to revitalize Syracuse by making the sidewalks wider, but it's really sad -- there's nothing left here now," said Dorothy Carpenter, 73, who remembers Dey Brothers from its glory days in the 1950's.
And, perched at her ultra-quiet desk down the street, in a building that has seen company after company move away or close, Mrs. Smith of the advertising firm said that above all, it made her gloomy. "I've always worked here, and I wouldn't want to work anywhere else," she said. "But it used to be fun, and now it's so depressing."

The seemingly inevitable has taken hold of Syracuse and left expanses of its downtown empty of businesses and its streets nearly deserted; The crowds have gone to the malls surrounding Syracuse, the newest and most spectacular of which is Carousel Center, which features 170 stores, its own post office and parking space to accommodate all visitors.

HEADLINE: Olympia Proposes Debt Delay

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO, Aug. 20

 BODY:
Three months after Olympia & York Developments Ltd., the world's biggest property manager, filed for bankruptcy protection in Canada, it is asking its biggest creditors to back a five-year moratorium on debt payments to allow the company to stay in business. The battle has been uphill all the way.
Under a proposal Olympia says it will file in a bankruptcy court here on Friday, bank lenders, bondholders and holders of short-term Olympia i.o.u.'s are being asked to postpone the payments on Canadian debts totaling $8.6 billion in return for various forms of equity. 
 The Reichmann brothers of Toronto, Olympia's publicity-shunning owners, disclosed today that they would offer to turn over 51 percent of their privately owned company to creditors, if the plan was accepted -- and up to 80 percent at the end of five years.
 
Trying to Avoid Breakup
 "We believe that is a far better outlook for all concerned than the immediate bust-up of the company," said Olympia's chief debt negotiator, Robert S. Miller Jr., who is on leave from the New York investment banking firm of James D. Wolfensohn Inc.
Justice Robert Blair of the Ontario Court's General Division set the Friday deadline after the company was unable to meet an earlier target of July 13. The company and its creditors spend the first seven weeks since court protection was granted on May 14 bickering over who would pay expenses of the restructuring effort, including millions of dollars a month of fees to armies of lawyers and advisers. In three months the legal bill has come to more than $10 million.
To help meet the costs, the Reichmann family, which built the real estate empire from a small tile-importing business in Toronto in the mid-1950's, have sold their Gulfstream executive jet to American Barrick Ltd. for $6.5 million and put up for sale a mansion in Hampstead Heath, London, valued at $4 million. The family's homes in the Bathurst Street area of north central Toronto are not for sale.
The family hopes to keep the company as an operating entity that once had a balance sheet brimming with billions of dollars. The company now has no net worth, despite $22 billion of premier real estate assets in Canada, the United States and Britain.
According to its latest financial statements, huge write-offs last year left Olympia $134 million (Canadian) in the red on Jan. 31, compared with a net worth of $2 billion a year earlier.
And even that data did not include any markdown of the value of the bankrupt Canary Wharf office building project in London, the company's flagship development, on which it spent about $3 billion. The project is now in danger of outright liquidation.
 
Maneuvering by Creditors
 Secured creditors in Canada are asking whether they would not be better off taking over the buildings themselves, getting new managers and either selling into the market or just holding on and hoping for appreciation. Some of Canada's largest banks, which together are owed about $3 billion, have already asked Judge Blair to remove the buildings that collateralize their loans from the bankruptcy proceedings -- an action that could hasten disintegration of the Canadian empire.
The banks argue that since these structures, which include some of the most prestigious business locations in downtown Toronto, enjoy a positive cash flow, unlike the Reichmann assets as a whole, there is no need for them to be part of a restructuring. The judge has said he will hear arguments on these motions after Olympia files its plan. The company's court protection will be in effect until Oct. 21.
"It's an incredible challenge to try to get the approval of all the creditors," said Harry Rannala, real estate analyst at McLean McCarthy, Inc., an investment house controlled by the Deutsche Bank of Germany. "Just one dissenting voice throws up a major roadblock."
John Ing, president of Maison Placements Inc., another investment house, added, "There would still have to be an awful lot of arm-twisting to get an agreement."
Oddly, analysts note, the decline in commercial real estate values, which contributed to the collapse of the Olympia empire, might just work in Olympia's favor in trying to cobble an agreement.
With the weak economy and a glut of office space, some analysts think the market in Canadian office property has yet to hit bottom. So if good values cannot be obtained by foreclosing and then liquidating buildings, it could be to everyone's advantage to sit tight and keep the portfolio together under Olympia's management.
"I think if you can keep priorities of creditors alive, then it makes more sense to hold the company together," said one Toronto property analyst who spoke only on condition of anonymity. "Olympia's real estate management abilities are good. Since the banks aren't interested in managing the properties themselves and hardly want to sell into this market, they'd have to contract the business out anyway. So why not just hold on and wait for the recovery."
His comments echoed an argument that Olympia officials themselves are making, noting that the Reichmanns' expertise as property managers, while intangible, still has a value that should not be underestimated.
Olympia's president, Gerald Greenwald, said a survey in June by an independent market research firm for the company found that the "responses reflected overwhelming support for the value of retaining Olympia & York's ownership and management roles.".
Apart from keeping the Canadian properties intact, a main objective of the family, led by its chief strategist, Paul Reichmann, has been to salvage some of the stake in Canary Wharf, which was placed under court administration in Britain in May after Olympia ran out of construction funds. It is now controlled by court-appointed administrators and a group of 11 lenders.
Mr. Reichmann recently approached a group of investors, led by Lewis Ranieri, former Salomon Brothers vice chairman and a longtime Reichmann family adviser; Lawrence Tisch, chairman of the Loews Corporation of New York, and Sanford Weill, chairman of the Primerica Corporation of Greenwich, Conn., and persuaded them to make a proposal, which if accepted could allow Olympia to stay as manager.
Negotiations are under way, but the prospects of a deal are not rated highly. Some London commentators predict the area will probably never become the bustling part of the metropolis envisaged when plans for the project were being laid in the middle to late 1980's.
Another objective of Paul Reichmann has been to maintain the segregation of Olympia's American properties. The hope is to quietly restructure their debts, while avoiding the kind of bankruptcy court protection Olympia was forced to seek in Canada.
The company has stressed that its United States properties are healthier and it has support of the banks there.
But Olympia faces heavy interest rate payments on Jan. 1 that may be difficult to meet. Even more worrisome is a threat of court action in New York made earlier this month by an international banking syndicate led by J. P. Morgan & Company and co-led by the Bank of Montreal.
Specifically the syndicate is seeking receipts from six office towers in New York and Los Angeles, which were pledged as collateral for a $160 million (United States) loan made to Olympia in 1991.
Olympia and the syndicate have negotiated for months to try to resolve a dispute. The six buildings are both towers of the World Financial Center, 59 Maiden Lane in New York, 245 Park Avenue, New York, 400 South Hope Street, Los Angeles, and 11601 Wilshire Boulevard, Los Angeles.
Should the syndicate make good its threat, Olympia could be pushed closer to bankruptcy proceedings in the United States.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Notes and Bonds Retreat in Price

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Treasury bond and note prices fell slightly yesterday in thin trading as investors waited to see what economic proposal President Bush would make in his acceptance speech and whether the rally in the market would resume soon.
"All eyes are on Texas," said John Costas, managing director of government trading at the First Boston Corporation. 
 "The uncertainity is everywhere and that is why the market is going nowhere," added Peter McTeague, a fixed-income analyst at Technical Data, a research firm in Boston.
But today after they know what Mr. Bush promised at the Republican National Convention, investors and traders will be able to return their focus to the slow-growing economy and declining inflation -- the two forces that have driven yields on the long bond to the lowest level in five and a half years.
And the market's direction today is what traders and investors will be watching.
"If he does not pull a rabbit out of the hat, the initial trading will lower prices," Mr. McTeague said, referring to the reception for Mr. Bush's acceptance speech.
But he said he expected investors and traders to begin buying Treasury securities again as long as there was no startling bad news and as long as the economic data affirmed that inflation was declining and the economy was still sluggish.
 
Impact of Uncertainty
 And if there is some leftover political uncertainty or anxiety, that will push investors to concentrate their buying in shorter maturities, like three-year and five-year notes, which are less risky because their prices will not fall as much as 30-year bonds if there is some sudden bad news.
In late trading in the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 7.25 percent 30-year bond was offered at a price of 99 5/32 , down 3/32 to yield 7.32 percent, compared with 7.31 percent Wednesday.
Economic data released yesterday did nothing to alter the picture of a weak economy. The 71,000 jump in initial unemployment claims to 474,000 was expected because of the temporary closing of plants by the General Motors Corporation and did not signal any worsening trend.
But the decline in the dollar to record lows against the German mark is not helping. Mr. Costas of First Boston said that analysts feel that the decline could make it less likely that the Federal Reserve will ease short-term interest rates in the next month. A cut in short-term rates by the Fed would further weaken the dollar by making dollar-denominated securities less attractive to foreign investors.
In the auction of $14.3 billion of one-year Treasury bills yesterday, the average discount rate was 3.28 percent, the lowest rate since April 10, 1963. But the average was one basis point, or hundredth of a percentage point, higher than the one-year auction in July.
 
More Squeezes
 Some traders said yesterday that they expect the demand for five-year Treasury notes, which has already caused "squeeze" conditions this week, to continue and possibly create the same kind of bind for some dealers and investors after the new five-year note is auctioned next week.
But that would not be unusual because traders said that there has been a squeeze in several of the recent five-year notes, which are auctioned monthly.
A "squeeze" occurs when there is such a shortage of a desired security, or such a high demand, that the price of that security or the cost of borrowing it is pushed extraordinarily high. A squeeze is not illegal, however, unless it is created by a manipulation of the market. Traders said they see no such manipulation in the current case. But the Government is investigating the possibility of illegal squeezes in conneciton with the Salomon Brothers trading scandal last year.
 
High Cost Securities
 The current 5.5 percent note due in July 1997 was in such demand this week that the traders said some investors or dealers were being forced to borrow the securities at a very high cost.
In the market for borrowing securities, an investor offers to make a loan in exchange for the securities he wants. As the demand for the security increases, the interest rate on the loan declines.
The loss for the investor borrowing the securities is the difference between what could be made by lending the money at current overnight rates, around 3.25 percent a year, and the low rate that must be offered to borrow the five-year notes. Well, last week this rate hit zero several times, several traders said.
"This is not the end; I expect similar type results," said one government trader of the new five-year note. "It is likely it will enyoy a better reception than the supply can handle."
Following is the result of the auction of the Treasury's one-year bill yesterday:

HEADLINE: THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: THE DEMOCRATS;
Clinton Needles Bush, Trying to Quiet His Thunder

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PONTIAC, Mich., Aug. 20

 BODY:
Gov. Bill Clinton returned to the campaign trail today to restake his claim to the votes of the disenchanted Democrats who went Republican in the 1980's.
"I ran hard to the Reagan Democrats in the primary," the Democratic Presidential nominee said. "And I intend to do it in the general election Well, we want them back." 
 By returning to the road in appearances here and in Battle Creek, Mich. on the day President Bush delivered a politically crucial acceptance speech at the Republican convention in Houston, Mr. Clinton sought to steal back some of the thunder the Republicans had made off with this week.
"What does my opponent say?" the Arkansas Governor asked a noontime lunch crowd in Battle Creek. "He says Bill Clinton's going to cost a million jobs. Let me tell you something. He's already cost a million jobs with defense cuts. Because he didn't reinvest the money in the American economy and putting the American people back to work."
 
Backed by Police Group
 Mr. Clinton also received the endorsement of the National Association of Police Officers, a 135,000-member organization which did not endorse a Presidential candidiate in 1988. In what has become a traditional campaign photo setting, Mr. Clinton posed for the announcement in front of a phalanx of blue-uniformed police.
Today's trip was another part of a Clinton strategy to keep the nominee in the political mix, in part to offset the favorable public-opinion bounce Mr. Bush was expected to take with him as he left the convention and entered what he has called "campaign mode."
In remarks to reporters today, Mr. Clinton seized on Labor Secretary Lynn Martin's defense of the Bush Administration, in which she said Wednesday that Americans were certainly better off than they were four years ago because the cold war had been won.
"I'm glad she asked that question," Mr. Clinton said. "That's what they said the test is. If they want to stay with the test that Ronald Reagan and George Bush imposed in 1980 -- Are you better off today than you were four years ago? -- then they have to lose the election. Because America is not better off."
 
'It's a Frame-Up'
 Mr. Clinton's cause was aided today as he accepted the backing of the police group from its president, Robert Scully. "In the last two days, some folks down in Houston sent out an all-points bulletin for a pair of lunatics who they say are going to ruin our country," Mr. Scully said. "Well, let me tell you something. We have thought long and hard about Bill Clinton and Al Gore. And we just don't see the resemblance. It's a frame-up, and a bad one at that."
Mr. Scully's remarks could have been written at the campaign headquarters in Little Rock, Ark., so perfect were his words for the message the campaign was trying to send today. Mr. Scully spoke of them as "the new kinds of Democrats" and denounced President Bush for not supporting gun-control legislation.
"George Bush's promises haven't stopped any murders, but getting handguns out of the hands of criminals will," he said.
Mr. Clinton has promised to support a waiting period for handgun sales and increase the number of police officers by 100,000.
 
Inconsistency Is Seen
 Mr. Clinton, speaking to a small crowd at the airport here, said the issue of crime control was "an issue like so many others, where this Administration says one thing and does another."
"They're down there in Houston talking about family values, and yet their No. 1 priority in the first two days of the convention were to attack my wife and my family," he said. "Near as I can tell, it didn't do them much good."
But Mr. Clinton said he expected Mr. Bush to live up to expectations and deliver "the speech of his life" in accepting the Republican nomination.
"But he gave the speech of his life four years ago when they said he had to give it," Mr. Clinton said. "And he gave the speech of his life four years ago in which he promised 15 million new jobs, no new taxes, an environmental Presidency, an education Presidency. It was a wonderful speech, but now we no longer have to read his lips. We can read his record."

HEADLINE: William Taylor of F.D.I.C. Dead at 53

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 20

 BODY:
William Taylor, one of the nation's senior banking regulators, died this morning at Fairfax Hospital in Fairfax, Va. He was 53 years old.
Mr. Taylor, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation since October, died of complications after undergoing surgery for colon blockage on Aug. 13, a spokesman for the agency said. The spokesman, Alan Whitney, said Mr. Taylor had developed pneumonia over the weekend and had had a heart attack this morning. 
 Mr. Taylor headed the F.D.I.C. at a pivotal point in the nation's banking crisis. A career regulator, he earned the high regard of Republicans in the White House and Democrats in Congress at a time when regulation had become increasingly partisan.
 
Praised as Man of Integrity
 "He was an extraordinary person -- a well-respected and extremely capable public servant of unquestioned integrity," said Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, who was a close friend.
Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, the Texas Democrat who heads the House Banking Committee, said Mr. Taylor's death "is a loss to the nation."
"Of all the regulators I have known during nearly 31 years on the committee," Mr. Gonzalez said, "Bill Taylor stands out pre-eminently as the man who stood up to the most powerful political and financial forces in our country, never compromising his integrity."
Mr. Taylor was among the most seasoned financial regulators in Washington. He was the American representative in London last year coordinating the worldwide seizure of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. A few months before that, he was the Federal Reserve's top man for the rescue of the Bank of New England. And in the mid-1980's he was involved in supervising banking crises in Ohio and Maryland.
When Mr. Taylor was sworn in as the F.D.I.C.'s 15th chairman on Oct. 25, to replace L. William Seidman, he took over the leadership of an agency that had been battered by hundreds of bank failures and run out of money to protect depositors at weak and insolvent banks. The agency was facing the prospect of a wave of bank failures that many experts said had threatened the collapse of the financial system and could be averted only through a huge infusion of taxpayer money.
 
Pressure on Bank Regulators
 Further complicating the agency's job was the emergence of a new climate of tighter lending, prompting the Bush Administration to chastise regulators and push them hard to ease lending restrictions and encourage banks toward making more loans.
In the last few months, he faced the skepticism of members of Congress who accused his agency of delaying the seizure of scores of institutions until after Election Day and the criticism of bankers who insisted that the worst was over and there was no reason to increase the insurance premiums they paid, eating into their profits.
Mr. Taylor's approach to bank regulation was to chart a middle course. In the first days of his tenure, he pushed Congress hard and quickly received a large taxpayer loan of more than $70 billion to bail out the Bank Insurance Fund. Later, he led the agency to increase the contributions paid by banks into the insurance fund. That effort came in the face of an intensive lobbying effort by the banks and the Bush Administration to keep the premiums from rising.
Often self-depreciating and dry in his humor, he confided in May on the eve of the vote on bank premiums that he had "felt enormous pressure everywhere" and that he had told his wife that after the job was done he might be pumping gasoline.
"That's self-service for you," he said.
On other issues, Mr. Taylor signaled his willingness to work with the White House. He took steps to make it easier for banks to challenge those bank examinations that were considered too tough and discouraged lending. He kept a file in his desk of complaints and frequently told officials in the field offices that the agency would not tolerate regulators who were unfairly hard on the banks.
 
Proposal for 'Bank Hospitals'
 One of his highest and most controversial priorities was trying to resolve the problems of ailing banks without liquidating them. He spoke frequently of "bank hospitals" in which a staff of bankers would take over weak institutions on behalf of the Government and nurse them back to health before they were sold.
And, in a few instances, he took the approach of bailing out institutions that some argued would have been less expensive to just sell or close.
His decision to invest in Crossland Savings at a cost of $1.2 billion, rather than sell it or close it, encountered significant criticism. He reached the decision after walking through Brooklyn and concluding that closing the institution, New York's largest savings bank, could have a devastating impact on the local economy.
In recent weeks, facing pressure from the industry, he refused to revise the agency's estimates of the possible Government costs of rescuing the banking industry, even though many banks around the nation had posted significant profits and benefited enormously from declining interest rates.
He arrived at the F.D.I.C. after serving as head of banking supervision at the Federal Reserve Board, where he was Mr. Greenspan's right-hand man. Despite his added responsibilities and increased stature, he was paid $35,000 less in his new post than his $150,000 salary at the Federal Reserve.
A native of Chicago, Mr. Taylor joined the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago as a bank examiner in 1961 after graduating from Cornell College in Mount Vernon, Iowa. In 1968 he joined Chicago's Upper Avenue Bank as vice president in charge of lending. In 1972 he became manager of the Chicago office of James W. Rouse & Company, a real estate development and mortgage banking firm, and returned to the Federal Reserve in 1976.
Mr. Taylor's is survived by his wife, Sharon; two daughters, Claire and Emily, and a son, William Taylor 3d, who is a sophomore at North Carolina State University.

HEADLINE: Charles L. Austin, 89, Steel Company Leader

 BODY:
Charles Lee Austin, former president and vice chairman of the old Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation of Pittsburgh, died Wednesday at the Mayflower Place nursing home in West Yarmouth, Mass. He was 89 years old.
Mr. Austin, a native of Port Chester, N.Y., graduated from Princeton University in 1924 and was an executive at several companies before joining J. & L. as treasurer and a director in 1942. 
 He became executive vice president of the steelmaker, then one of the country's largest, in 1948 and was elected president four years later. Within weeks, the company and the rest of the steel industry underwent one of its worst crises, in a wage-price dispute with its labor force and the Government.
President Harry S. Truman, citing military requirements for steel, ordered the seizure of the industry in early May. The Supreme Court voided the order in June, and 600,000 steelworkers went on strike. A settlement on wage and price increases was not reached until July.
Mr. Austin became vice chairman of J. & L. in 1956 and retired the next year. He then served for three years as a steel consultant to the World Bank.
J. & L. combined with the Republic Steel Corporation in 1984 to form the LTV Steel Company of Cleveland, part of the LTV Corporation of Dallas.
Mr. Austin is survived by his wife of nearly 64 years, the former Louise Bradley Wilson; two sons, Charles Lee Austin Jr. of Manhattan and John Bradbury Austin of Evanston, Ill., and one granddaughter.

HEADLINE: Lindsley F. Kimball, 97, Is Dead; Founded New York Blood Center

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
Lindsley F. Kimball, a longtime Rockefeller family associate who organized the New York Blood Center and also headed the U.S.O. and National Urban League, died on Sunday at his home in Newtown, Pa. He was 97 years old.
He died of an intestinal hemorrhage, a family spokeswoman said. 
 Mr. Kimball led the founding of the blood center, the nation's largest, in the early 1960's. The center ended the chaos in the region's blood supply that sometimes resulted in tainted blood donations and shortages that delayed operations and even forced emergency transfusions with wrong blood types.
The new centralized system serves metropolitan New York and New Jersey and distributes a tenth of the nation's blood bank supply. Its research center, named for Dr. Kimball, identified and isolated hepatitis B virus and helped develop a hepatitis B vaccine.
The blood center was only one of many charitable and social service agencies to which Dr. Kimball applied his organizational skills until his retirement in 1979.
 
A Presidential Medal
 In World War II and the Korean War, he served as president of the United Service Organizations, the coalition of groups assisting American military men and women. His efforts won a presidential medal from Harry S. Truman.
For several years he served as president of the National Urban League, where he recruited Whitney Young as executive director.
Dr. Kimball also was the national fund-raising chairman for the United Negro College Fund for several years and the vice president of the General Education Board, an organization supporting higher education.
He conducted a study that led to the formation of the Greater New York branch of the American Red Cross in a merger of its borough units and also helped create the national Council on Foundations.
His positions with the Rockefeller family included executive vice president of the Rockefeller Foundation, trustee and treasurer of Rockefeller University, associate of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund and aide to John D. Rockefeller Jr.
 
A Wartime Invention
 Mr. Kimball was born in Brooklyn. He graduated from Columbia University in 1917.
In World War I, he served four years in the United States Navy. There he invented a mathematical device to adjust the aim of turret guns for the listing of a ship. He became the commanding officer of a submarine-chasing squadron and reached the rank of lieutenant.
After the war Mr. Kimball worked four years in the managerial offices of the Underwood Typewriter Company and studied accounting.
His career in nonprofit work began as a young Sunday school superintendent at St. Paul's Congregational Church in Brooklyn. Under his direction, enrollment multiplied from fewer than 100 to more than 500. His church work continued for decades. In Manhasset, L.I., where he lived much of his life, he was founding member of the Congregational Church and supervised its school as its rolls grew to more than 1,000.
His next cause was the Boy Scouts of America. He founded a troop in Brooklyn and eventually left his job at Underwood to become the full-time chief executive of the Brooklyn Council, the nation's largest. His work earned high ratings and led to regional and national scouting posts.
While with the Boy Scouts, Mr. Kimball resumed his studies and earned a doctorate in economics and sociology from New York University in 1930.
In 1938 he became a top officer in the new Greater New York Fund, which later merged with United Way. His work there with corporate executives caught the attention of Mr. Rockefeller, who recruited him to work on special projects.
Surviving are his wife of nearly 66 years, the former Maude Kouwenhoven; two sons, Richard T. of Wyomissing, Pa., and Dean F. of Westford, Mass.; 12 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims Took Biggest Lep Since '82

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON Aug. 20 (AP)

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits took its largest jump in more than 10 years early this month as a result of a two-week shutdown of General Motors operations, the Labor Department said today.
Excluding the G.M. factor, first-time applications for unemployment insurance would have been little changed, said Paul Lally, an economist with R. H. Wrightson & Associates in New York. 
 "No real improvement," he said, "but no real deterioration either."
"We're still locked into a slow-growth employment path," agreed Robert G. Dederick, an economist with the Northern Trust Company of Chicago. "It could be worse, but it should be better."
The Labor Department said the number of new claims surged by 71,000, to 474,000, in the week ended Aug. 8, reflecting the "large number of claims in the state of Michigan resulting from the temporary shutdown of General Motors during the final two weeks of July."
 
Biggest Rise Since '82
 It was the largest one-week increase since the 83,000 in the week ended Jan. 23, 1982, during the previous recession. And it raised the total to the highest level since 479,000 applications were filed in the week ended Dec. 7, 1991.
Claims had been hovering in the low-400,000's since spring, dropping to 400,000 for the week ended July 18. That had been the smallest number since Oct. 6, 1990, when 382,000 people made their first trips to the unemployment office.
The G.M. shutdown was first reflected in the week ended July 25, when claims surged by 69,000, to 469,000, as auto workers outside Michigan sought benefits. But applications in Michigan, which had switched to a mail-in filing system, were not reported until today.
Mr. Lally said he believes claims may drop below 400,000 this fall, although the labor market probably will not show any real improvement until the fourth quarter or early next year.
The new claims pushed the four-week moving average to 436,500, the highest since 438,000 for the period ended April 4.
The number of new claims rose by 74,221 in Michigan alone.

HEADLINE: The Art Market

BYLINE: By Charles Hagen

 BODY:

Still a Good Deal
Photography remains a relatively bright spot in the otherwise dismal art market of the last two years, with a number of photography dealers reporting that sales have been holding steady, or even rising. A major reason for this appears to be the widespread sense among both dealers and collectors that photographs, which are still relatively inexpensive compared with works in other media, are underpriced as well.
Moreover, photography didn't experience the same frantic rise in prices that hit much of the rest of the market during the 1980's, and so did not have as far to fall when boom turned to bust. 
Laurence Miller, a New York photography dealer, points to the increased number of painting galleries that include photography among their offerings. "That's where a lot of the action is," he says.
Another reason for photography's continued success in the marketplace is a recent series of large purchases by institutions, both in the United States and abroad. "There's been a big growth in museum acquisitions internationally," Mr. Miller says.
Peter MacGill, of the Pace/MacGill Gallery in Manhattan, agrees: "The top artists translate everywhere."
 
Bulk Sales to Europe
 As evidence for this new trend, Mr. MacGill points to a recent sale, organized by his gallery, to the Maison Europeene de la Photographie, a new museum in Paris devoted to recent photography. Included in the sale were 40 prints by Irving Penn and a set of prints by Robert Frank from his classic book "The Americans." Mr. MacGill also cites recent purchases of large groups of works by various artists, including Emmet Gowin, Josef Koudelka and Henri Cartier-Bresson, as well as Mr. Penn and Mr. Frank, by a private foundation in Spain. The work is slated to be donated to the Valencia Institute of Modern Art.
It's not just European museums that are buying photographs in bulk. For several years, Sarah Greenough, curator at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, has been purchasing large numbers of photographs by a few major figures, among them Harry Callahan, Walker Evans and Mr. Frank. And in the spring the Art Institute of Chicago acquired 100 prints by Joel Sternfeld as the first entry in what Colin Westerbeck Jr., assistant curator in the department of photography, describes as a new "archive of work by prominent contemporary color photographers."
 
Matching Sets
 But because color photographs are notoriously susceptible to fading, there's a twist to the story: the acquisition actually consists of two matching sets of 50 prints each, produced especially by Mr. Sternfeld for the occasion. One set, Mr. Westerbeck explains, will be used for exhibitions and day-to-day research, while the other will be kept in the institute's cold-storage facilities, where the risk of their fading will be greatly diminished. These prints will be taken out only to be examined by selected scholars.
"It's not so meaningful now," Mr. Westerbeck concedes, "but in five years, or 10 years, someone who wanted to see a mint set of the work could look at the prints" that had been kept in the freezer.
Mr. Sternfeld's pictures, some of which are on view at the Art Institute through Oct. 11, are a promised gift from Richard Press, a member of the institute's photography committee, and an anonymous partner. Mr. Press is an investment consultant with the Chicago financial firm of Stein, Roe & Farnham.
 
Down, but Not Drastic
 Auction prices in a number of sectors of the art market have suffered in the current economic downturn. But photography has been a relatively steady performer. Beth Gates-Warren, head of photography for Sotheby's in New York, reports the house's April auction of photographs went "reasonably well," with a total of $1.5 million realized and 70 percent of the offered lots sold. This is down from the $2.3 million brought in during Sotheby's photography sale in October 1990. By comparison, the total achieved in Sotheby's auctions of contemporary art fell from $82 million in spring 1990 to $19.4 million last spring.
At Christie's in New York, Rick Wester, who took over as head of the photography department on June 1, reports similar results. "It wasn't gangbusters," he says of Christie's April photography sale, but he describes the results, with a total of $1.3 million and 76 percent of the lots sold, as "pretty encouraging."
Both Ms. Gates-Warren and Mr. Wester see the market sorting itself out, with prices for established artists continuing to rise. "I don't think prices for major photographers have suffered," Ms. Gates-Warren says. "But prices for lesser lights have fallen off a bit. Buyers are not quite as curious right now."
"Good prints by good photographers always sell well," Mr. Wester says.
The October session is Mr. Wester's first auction in his new job. The 35-year-old Mr. Wester was a private dealer in New York the last 10 years, and an assistant at the Light Gallery there before that. He takes over from Claudia Gropper, who left Christie's after the October 1991 sale. Monika Half, who organized last spring's sale for the house, is staying on as a senior specialist.
Mr. Wester is particularly enthusiastic about a complete edition of Edward S. Curtis's "North American Indian," which will be offered on Oct. 13. Published between 1907 and 1930, the set is made up of 20 text volumes and 20 portfolios and includes 2,257 large photogravures printed on handmade etching paper. Curtis's pictures of American Indian life have been widely criticized as overly romantic and often staged, but over the years they have also attracted an enthusiastic audience. Christie's estimates that the set, one of fewer than 100 printed on this kind of paper, will sell for $150,000 to $200,000.
 
Mexican Gems
 Ms. Gates-Warren, too, is preparing for her next photography sale, to be held at Sotheby's on Oct. 15 and 16. The offerings include two prints by Tina Modotti, the Italian-born photographer who worked in Mexico in the 1920's before taking up a career as a Communist revolutionary. Two years ago, the photo world was set atwitter when a print by Modotti was bought by Susie Tompkins, the owner of the Esprit Sportswear Company, for the record price of $165,000, including a 10 percent buyer's premium. Ms. Gates-Warren estimates that each of the Modottis being offered this fall will bring a more modest $25,000 to $35,000. The gem of Sotheby's sale is another picture made in Mexico in the same period but this time by Edward Weston, who was Modotti's lover and mentor. The presale estimate for the 1929 picture, which Weston referred to as a "pear-shaped nude," is $75,000 to $100,000.

HEADLINE: FOOTBALL;
Call Your Broker: Stocks Outperformed N.F.L. Teams

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: MINNEAPOLIS, Aug. 20

 BODY:
Attorneys for eight players suing the National Football League on antitrust grounds said today that some financial conclusions of the league's economist were incomplete.
A University of Iowa professor, George Daly, testified on Wednesday and earlier today that N.F.L. owners earned less money by buying football teams than they would have in other industries in the 1980's. 
 Jeffrey Kessler, an attorney for the players, stressed that Daly's conclusions did not include the money owners made in salary and operating profit on their teams.
Taking the Philadelphia Eagles as a case in point, Daly had testified that the rate of return for the owner, Norman Braman, was slightly more than 9 percent on his $67.5 million purchase in 1985, if the franchise was worth $125 million today.
The same $67.5 million invested in a mutual fund specializing in the Standard and Poor's 500 index would have returned 18.1 percent, or almost twice as much, Daly testified.
"What is not included in that number is all of the profits on the books of the Philadelphia Eagles, all of the profits he has taken out of the team in the seven and a half years he has owned the team," Kessler said in his cross-examination of Daly.
 
Eagles Turned Profits
 The Eagles were one of the N.F.L.'s most profitable teams in the late 1980's, earning a reported $34.3 million from 1985 to 1989. In addition, Braman paid himself a $7.5 million salary in 1990.
The Standard and Poor's 500 index Daly used to compare rates of return included dividends, while the N.F.L. values did not, Kessler said.
Daly said the rate of return to owners of professional football teams based on the value of their franchises rose 16 percent from 1980-89. That rate is lower than the returns of other industries, including broadcasting, entertainment, foods and drugs, Daly said.
 
Disagrees With Davis
 Kessler said there were instances in the broadcasting industry where cable companies earn monopoly profits much like the N.F.L. The league is arguing that it does not enjoy the benefits of a monopoly.
Daly said even though there were 28 bidders for Phoenix safety Tim McDonald, the interest in the player did not mean that he would receive a higher salary than he got from the Cardinals.
Daly also disagreed with Al Davis, the Los Angeles Raiders' managing general partner, who said in his deposition that dynasties were good for professional football.
"Football people are experts about football," Daly said. "Football people are less expert about the demand for football."
The trial was scheduled to recess later this afternoon until Wednesday while Judge David Doty attends to other cases.

Lombard's Madcap Recipe: Hauteur, Chic and Humor

BYLINE: By VINCENT CANBY

 BODY:
THE initial setting in Howard Hawks's "Twentieth Century" (1934) is a bare Broadway stage where Oscar Jaffe (John Barrymore), a theater impresario deferentially called "sire" by his press agent, is taking the first day of rehearsals of his new production. The show is a ghastly romance set in an antebellum South whose fictional apogee would be reached a few years later in "Gone With the Wind." The air is thick with out-of-state "Ah-declares" and "you-alls."
Oscar is having difficulty with his latest discovery, an ex-lingerie model nee Mildred Plotka (Carole Lombard), whom he has newly christened Lily Garland. Eager and ambitious but painfully shy, Lily isn't screaming the way Oscar demands when she hears that her daddy has shot her lover dead on the front lawn. Her best attempt is a tentative "eek." Oscar, a Krakatoa waiting to erupt, is gentle and avuncular. 
 "That kind of acting," he says, "is for pins in a basement." He urges her to let herself go, but the "eeks" only become more self-conscious. Finally, at the moment that Lily is again required to scream, Oscar picks up a hatpin only a little smaller than a rail spike. With the authority of Zeus letting go a thunderbolt, he directs it at her rear end.
As Lily bellows the surprised fury of an impaled mother elephant, Carole Lombard roars into the collective consciousness as the grandest, most skilled, most uninhibited American comic actress of her day, and of any day since. At the same time, "Twentieth Century" is on its way to becoming the most delectable American film farce ever made or, at least, the first among a trio of equals that would include Ernst Lubitsch's "To Be or Not to Be" (1942) and Billy Wilder's "Some Like It Hot" (1959).
Just how much the dazzling Lombard contributed to both "Twentieth Century" and "To Be or Not to Be" can be seen in "Nothing Sacred: Silver Screenings With Carole Lombard," the not-to-be-missed 10-day retrospective organized by the Film Society of Lincoln Center. It begins today at the Walter Reade Theater.
The opening attraction? "Twentieth Century." It will be half of a double bill today and tomorrow with another of Lombard's 1934 films, "Bolero," a rather elegant studio pot-boiler, directed by Wesley Ruggles, in which George Raft receives top billing.
Lombard was -- is -- a phenomenon. With her strong, almost classical features, her pale blond hair and sleek figure, she is downright gorgeous but capable, on cue, of looking and sounding like a fishwife. The voice is alternately soothing and abrasive. She can call hogs if necessary. Satin evening gowns, worn without bras and fitted to the skin of her hips, give her a sensuousness that is often seriously, uproariously compromised by full-bodied, unladylike laughter. Even at her most chic, playing characters of monumental egos, Lombard gives the impression of being the least vain of actresses. She's someone who might compete in the frosty icon department with Garbo, Dietrich and Crawford, except that she can't keep a straight face. She's a woman with a low tolerance for institutional fraud. When, with the best of intentions, she goes for the gold in so-called serious drama, something seems not right, as when she plays the heroic English nurse in "Vigil in the Night" (1940), directed by George Stevens.
Having been nominated for an Oscar for her performance as the manic Irene Bullock in the classic screwball comedy "My Man Godfrey" (1936), and having lost to Luise Rainer of "The Great Ziegfeld," Lombard was convinced that she stood another chance with "Vigil in the Night." She wasn't even nominated, probably for the wrong reasons. The film was released early in the year and wasn't a big box-office hit.
More to the point: though she is quite good in "Vigil in the Night," she is an actress who is least convincing when she is trying to scale herself down to the solemn proportions of missionary denial and sacrifice. She is much better in her other 1940 film, Garson Kanin's adaptation of Sidney Howard's "They Knew What They Wanted." The film itself is a piece of cheese, not helped by Charles Laughton's hammy performance as a Napa Valley grape farmer or by a ludicrously moral ending dictated by the Production Code. The rural environment doesn't suit her talent, but Lombard has a tough, breezy authenticity as Laughton's mail-order bride.
Watching her play more or less straight drama is to see a great actress working at half speed. It throws her off her pace. One result is her inability in "Vigil in the Night" to deliver conviction to the ripe line "Our war never ends. You can't sign a peace treaty with disease." The expectation is that she will screw her tongue into the corner of her mouth, as she does every time she tells a whopper in "True Confession," a not-quite-successful 1937 screwball comedy in which she appears as a pathological liar.
Playing sincere in "Vigil in the Night" and "Made for Each Other" (1939), a decent but contrived domestic drama in which she co-stars with James Stewart, Lombard seems faux naive. Thus reined in, she suggests an aspiring 14-year-old about to deliver Portia's "quality of mercy" speech. She is an actress whose intelligence is fully expressed only in comedy.
The Lombard career is an odd one. She was born in 1908, made her first film as a child actress in 1921 and later had a short run as a Mack Sennett bathing beauty. She didn't really move into the major studios until 1928, just as talkies were coming in. Between 1928 and her death in January 1942 in an airplane crash, she appeared in 45 features, often as the star. She probably survived more dreadful movies than any other major actress of her time.
Several of these are included in the Walter Reade retrospective, though now they have a certain historical interest: "Supernatural" (1933), a tepid horror film in which she plays a society girl possessed by the soul of a convicted murderer; "Lady by Choice" (1934), a flabby follow-up to Frank Capra's 1933 hit "Lady for a Day," and "Fools for Scandal" (1938), a comedy-with-music (two songs) to accommodate her European co-star, Fernand Gravet, whose Hollywood career was not long.
Of far more interest in the retrospective are those classy if uncharacteristic Lombard romantic dramas that were considered in their day to be far more prestigious than her comedies: "Made for Each Other" and "In Name Only" (1939), both directed by John Cromwell. "In Name Only" presents the curious spectacle of Lombard and Cary Grant, two of the most accomplished comic performers of their time, playing a sudsy wife-versus-mistress triangle in upper-middle-class Connecticut.
Not included in the retrospective are "No Man of Her Own" (Wesley Ruggles, 1932), by all reports a minor film but the only time she played opposite Clark Gable, whom she would later marry, and "My Man Godfrey" (Gregory La Cava), one of her most fondly remembered hits, in which she plays opposite her ex-husband, the incomparable William Powell. The film society's apparent reason for not including "Godfrey" is that the film is shown so frequently on television and is available on video.
The absence of "Godfrey" is unfortunate in any summation of the Lombard career. It is one of the richest films in the screwball tradition so closely associated with life in Depression America. It also shows Lombard to be the equal of Irene Dunne and Claudette Colbert as the much-beloved, madcap screwball heroine.
If there's any doubt about this, check out the retrospective's showings of "Hands Across the Table" (1935), directed by Mitchell Leisen, in which Lombard, co-starring with Fred MacMurray, plays a manicurist out to catch a rich husband; "The Princess Comes Across" (1936, directed by William K. Howard, also with MacMurray and notable for Lombard's marvelous imitation of Greta Garbo; "Nothing Sacred" (1937), with Fredric March, written by Ben Hecht and directed by William Wellman, about a scheming young woman from Vermont who makes her fortune by saying she's dying of radium poisoning, and, a must-see, "Mr. and Mrs. Smith" (1941), written by Norman Krasna and directed by Alfred Hitchcock.
This is one of the most underrated comedies of its time, largely ignored by the critics and the public because Hitchcock was not expected to make a screwball comedy. Yet it's one of Lombard's best and, as is always the case in her successful films, she has a leading man who is her psychic match, Robert Montgomery.
"My Man Godfrey" is also missed for the way it demonstrates the differences between screwball comedy and the kind of pure farce so gloriously defined by "Twentieth Century" and "To Be or Not to Be." Screwball comedy is, even if indirectly, a product of the political, social and economic conditions of the times. Great farce is something else. It takes place as if in a glass bubble floating through space, detached from earthly laws of gravity and conventional systems of rewards and punishments.
It's not necessary to know anything about the Broadway theater of the 1930's to respond to the delirious, hermetically sealed world of "Twentieth Century," evoked by the brilliant script by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur, and by Hawks's magical direction. The film tells you all you need to know to appreciate the hilarious love-hate relationship of Oscar Jaffe and Lily Garland. The main setting is the crackerjack train speeding from Chicago to New York with Oscar, Lily and a most enchanting crew of oddballs, including two bewildered cast members of the Oberammergau Passion Play.
"To Be or Not to Be," written by Edwin Justus Mayer, is set in Nazi-occupied Poland but is just as far removed from reality as "Twentieth Century," which was the reason Lubitsch was roundly criticized at the time of its release in 1942. It, too, is about self-absorbed theater folk, mainly Joseph and Maria Tura (Jack Benny and Lombard), ham actors supreme who somehow manage to outwit the entire German Army before they are done. Though the Mel Brooks-Anne Bancroft remake is almost as fine, the Lubitsch-Benny-Lombard original is about as close to heaven as movie farces ever get.
In each of her classic films, Lombard plays opposite an actor who is her screen equal. Barrymore's performance in "Twentieth Century" forever transformed her talents. Otherwise untrained, Lombard learned a lot from Barrymore. He gave her insight into a comic method that goes beyond screwball to farce and that would be evident later in everything she did. It's especially apparent in her work with Powell, Montgomery and even Benny, whose performance in "To Be or Not to Be" is completely unexpected of a radio comedian, even a great one.
Lombard never became a figure of camp, perhaps because she wasn't around long enough, though I doubt that's the reason. Rather, I suspect, it's because she obviously was too passionate and too committed as a woman of ordinary appetites. She never stands alone in her films, like Garbo, Dietrich and Crawford. She was never a queen bee. If the actor isn't up to her measure when he starts out with her, he quickly learns the ropes, as did MacMurray, with whom she played in four films.
It would be chauvinist to say that Lombard needs a man. It's rather more accurate to say that, given the opportunity, she responds to men. She likes them. Lombard in her films seems complete only with a man, which is why there is such a magnificently daffy human face on even her most over-the-top comedies. Yet she's never subservient to the man. She is his equal.
If the man doesn't understand, then like Oscar Jaffe, he may have a number of large precious objects hurled at his head with the accuracy of a Dizzy Dean. Lombard is simultaneously of this earth and divine.

HEADLINE: CONFLICT IN THE BALKANS;
U.S. Seeks New Mechanism To Try to End Balkan War

BYLINE: By DAVID BINDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 20

 BODY:
The United States will press next week for tighter sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro and for the creation of a more durable international negotiating "mechanism" aimed at ending the Balkan conflict, Lawrence S. Eagleburger, the Deputy Secretary of State, said today.
In an interview, Mr. Eagleburger, who will take over the State Department as Acting Secretary on Sunday, said he would bring both proposals to a conference in London that begins on Wednesday. Last June the United States joined other members of the United Nations in imposing economic and political sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro, which are viewed as the supporters of Serbian aggression in Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
 "I think we have to do what we can to tighten down the sanctions," Mr. Eagleburger said. "I hope we'll get agreement at the conference on that."
The resignation of Secretary of State James A. Baker 3rd is effective Sunday, when he will become White House chief of staff, and Mr. Eagleburger will serve as Acting Secretary at least until the Presidential election on Nov. 3.
The United Nations Security Council has also authorized the use of force to protect the shipment of food and medicine to beleaguered civilians in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In Brussels today, military authorities of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization completed a plan to protect such shipments by deploying 6,000 to 11,000 troops. Alliance members are scheduled to confer on the plan Monday in Brussels.
According to diplomats at the United Nations, a major unanswered question about whatever troops are deployed is who will lead them -- the United Nations or some sort of European-led authority. American negotiators joined with representatives from other countries to discuss this issue with representatives from the Balkan countries.
The sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro followed a United Nations Security Council resolution condemning the two republics, which now constitute Federal Yugoslavia, for aggression against neighboring Bosnia and Herzegovina.
According to State Department assessments, the sanctions have begun to bite in Serbia and Montenegro, but loopholes remain, especially along Serbia's frontier with Romania, a major part of which runs along the Danube.
 
U.S. May Monitor Danube
 The United States has begun discussions with Romania about dispatching United States technical personnel to monitor shipping on the Danube and other border traffic to prevent evasion of the embargo, particularly shipments of oil. Serbia produces about 15 percent of its own petroleum needs.
The three-day London conference next week is scheduled to bring together representatives of the warring parties from former Yugoslavia along with the 12 European Community members, the United Nations and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.
Representatives of all six former Yugoslav republics have been invited, but Mr. Eagleburger said it was not clear who might attend. "I gather Milosevic is playing coy," he said, referring to Slobodan Milosevic, the president of Serbia, who is treated by the Bush Administration as the main instigator of the Balkan fighting.
Of the London discussions, Mr. Eagleburger said: "You cannot expect and should not expect that this conference is going to end the war. But what we can do is something that deals with it on a day to day basis more directly."
"The thing I hope for the most," he said, was agreement by the London conference on "an establishment of some sort of permanent mechanism." He described this as "a mechanism that's there every day to try to deal with this issue, to pursue negotiations for peace.
 
Seeks Permanent Negotiators
 He said he could not provide more details about the mechanism, but that it would set up a permanent negotiating staff and location under European or United Nations auspices to serve as a forum for ending the war and resolving the political disputes that led to it.
Mr. Eagleburger said the London conference would also address the problem of how to assist the more than 2.2 million refugees scattered about the Balkan territory as a result of the fighting in Croatia and Bosnia.
"I hope there will be a fairly substantial agreement on some steps," he said. "We are going to have to deal with a lot of refugees this winter."
Under the NATO plan drafted in Brussels today, mechanized infantry forces would be used to guard relief convoys from the Adriatic port of Split in Croatia to Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, while aircraft would fly protective missions overhead. The bulk of that route is under the control of Croatian forces. The last stretch, mostly through mountains, is controlled by Serbian forces.
 
U.S. Offers Air Support
 The new plan comes in the wake of recent statements by Britain and France that they are prepared to deploy modest forces to ensure the delivery of aid. The United States has so far said only that it is willing to provide air power. Mr. Eagleburger repeated that position today.
The new plan represents a substantial scaling back of a proposal orginally drafted by the NATO military authorities at the request of the Bush Administration, which urged the alliance to devise a plan for carrying out the United Nations Security Council resolution earlier this month that authorizes the use of force.
Originally, NATO military authorities concluded that 100,000 troops were needed to secure the land route from the Adriatic to Sarajevo and to protect the airport. But last week that plan was rejected by alliance members because it called for too large a force.
The plan circulated today is deemed more politically acceptable but would entail higher military risks. Under the plan, forces would not seek to secure the land route but would use armed escorts and air cover to protect road convoys. The size of the force would depend on the disposition of the United Nations. If the United Nations peacekeeping force in Bosnia stayed in place, 6,000 additional troops would be needed. If the United Nations force pulled out, NATO envisons the deployment of 11,000 troops.

HEADLINE: POLITICS AND THE FAMILY: ISSUES: FAMILY VALUES;
'Family Values' and Women: Is G.O.P. a House Divided?

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Aug. 20

 BODY:
Family values, the 1990's version of apple pie and motherhood, has taken on a far more ominous meaning this week at the Republican National Convention.
Republicans have tried to define family values by suggesting that they have them and that Bill and Hillary Clinton do not. But by painting Mrs. Clinton as an unwifely feminist with undue influence on her husband's policy-making -- Gloria Steinem with the claws of Madame Nhu -- Bush strategists may have unleashed an issue that is dividing members of their own party at the same time it is distinguishing their party from the Democrats. 
 The attempt to portray Mrs. Clinton as outside the American mainstream is part of a broader cultural message, and it has prompted debate over the political benefits of defining "family values" in a way that casts aspersions on women who work.
The Census Bureau says 56 percent of women over 15, and more than half of the women who vote, are in the work force. To the degree that the Republicans' attempt to define "family values" divides them from women who do not, there is fear that the strategy could backfire, alienating Republican women already distressed over their party's rigid anti-abortion platform.
 
Some Have Misgivings
 There is a paradox in tone between the two women the campaign has presented as avatars of Republican family values. Mrs. Bush, who cared for her family and never pursued a profession, sounded an inclusive note by saying women should be encouraged to do either or both. Mrs. Quayle, who is a lawyer but gave up her profession, seemed to criticize women who disagreed with her choice.
The injection of family into politics has fueled a wide range of emotions on the issue at the convention and beyond. Even many delegates -- and party leaders -- expressed misgivings about focusing on "family values" in a way that could divide the Republican family.
"I didn't come down here thinking about family values," said Joan Rader, the vice-chairwoman of the Connecticut delegation. "I came down thinking about the economy."
Jode Rell, another delegate, said she feared that the focus on family values could lead to "more of a backlash" in the fall.
Republicans who want the party to reach out to all women -- and all configurations of family -- fear that it mainly seems to be condemning the choice made by Mrs. Clinton.
Mrs. Quayle said in her speech that women should be free to choose a job and family and accused the Democrats of denigrating women who prefer to stay home.
But Representative Constance A. Morella of Maryland said, "I had a little concern that she was designating the proper role of women," although she did not think Mrs. Quayle meant to be divisive.
She said Mrs. Quayle's speech reminded her of a long-discredited Supreme Court opinion that Justice Joseph P. Bradley wrote in 1872 on the role of women. She knew it by heart. "The paramount destiny and mission of women are to fulfill the noble and benign offices of wife and mother -- this is the law of the Creator."
 
The Elusive Definitions
 Many elected officials spoke of fears of a backlash to the family-values campaign. "I am a little concerned about this continued emphasis on us against them," said Representative Susan Molinari of Staten Island. "I think a tone was set that seems to imply that only Republicans have family values, and I represent a lot of Democrats who hold family values and who exemplify family values very well."
Republican speakers at the convention invoked "family values" in support of their positions on abortion, homosexuality and the size of government, but many voters see the phrase in more economic terms.
"There is the issue of day care and how to afford it," said Ann Ault, an accountant and lifelong Republican, who was attending a business meeting today at the Galleria, an upscale shopping complex. Mrs. Ault said that her sister was a housewife but that she herself could not afford to stay home. "If you do work, people ask you where your child is and what you're doing about it," she said, "Even my sister-in-law, she feels guilty staying at home."
 
Exploiting Insecurity?
 The Republicans seem eager to exploit the feelings of insecurity of women like Mrs. Ault's sister.
Bush campaign aides say the assault on Mrs. Clinton is aimed at appealing to suburban voters, a group the Bush campaign considers crucial. (After the Los Angeles riots, Mr. Bush's advisers anxiously polled suburban areas to determine what the President's exact response should be.)
"It's specifically directed at the women who are tired of hearing that they have to have careers, and if they give them up, they're somehow not as good," said one senior campaign official. "Voters who live in the suburbs and are sick of being told they made the wrong choices, that they are not politically correct, that their life styles are somehow wrong.
That "silent majority" approach in the 1960's, pitting housewives against feminists, showed up in Mrs. Quayle's speech. Siding with the part of her generation that loathed Woodstock, she spoke of "liberals," who are "disappointed because most women do not wish to be liberated from their essential natures as women."
But Mrs. Quayle's sentiments are not always easy to find in suburbia. "I'm not a career woman, but the women have a real struggle," said Phoebe Duggan, a retired teacher who was eating frozen yogurt at the Northwest Mall, 20 miles from the Astrodome. "They try to be all things to their husband and follow a career."
The most conservative voices in the party have already supplied an answer to a question that even Sigmund Freud could not answer: "What do women want?" But Republicans closer to the middle want their party to embrace working women as well as more traditional wives.
Ms. Rell, a Connecticut State Representative, said that even though she disliked Mrs. Clinton, she feared a backlash from women against the party. "Does she represent mainstream American women?" she asked. "I think that is different for everybody."
Some women at the convention see a feminist message in the family-values campaign. "The Republican Party is saying that American women have the intelligence and ability to be working mothers and to do it well," said Martha Fallgatter, a 44-year-old delegate from Bakersfield, Calif., who is a divorced mother of five. "And the other message coming through is that if you as a woman choose to be a mother and not have a career, that is also a good value choice."
But that message may be getting lost outside party headquarters. "The Republicans are the old way and they are reluctant to change," said Suanne Tennant, an equipment sales representative. A Republican, she said she might vote for the Democrat this year: "The Republicans want it all, but it's a Catch-22."

HEADLINE: UNDER THE DOME: NEWS ANALYSIS;
No Choice but to Confront the Economy

BYLINE: By R.W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Aug. 20

 BODY:
When the Republicans arrived in Houston last weekend, the salient issue of the 1992 Presidential campaign was the economy, and when they leave town this weekend, it will still be the economy.
But President Bush reframed the debate tonight, promising across-the-board tax cuts next year if the new Congress agrees to spending cuts to offset them. It was a bold attempt to persuade the American people to forgive him for the increases he accepted in June 1990, and give him another chance. It was also a brisk challenge to the Democrats -- the Democrats who control the House and Senate as well as Mr. Bush's Democratic opponents this fall. 
 In effect, the President apologized, something Presidents seldom do. He invited those who voted for him in 1988 and have had their doubts since to choose between himself, a tax-cutter reborn, and Bill Clinton, whom he and innumerable convention speakers have portrayed as a tax-raiser unrepentant.
The Republicans talked mostly about other things during their time here, and Mr. Bush devoted a lot of time to foreign policy for someone who has been castigated for devoting too much. Once again he took credit for his party for winning the cold war, and he gleefully zapped Mr. Clinton for his views on the Persian Gulf war: "While I bit the bullet, he bit his nails."
Then, in a hard-nosed acceptance speech that was rapturously received in the echoing, jam-packed Astrodome, the President turned back to dollars and cents. He had no real choice. Parties run on economics when the numbers are with them, and they run away when the numbers are against them. But there are limits, especially when the voters have been telling poll-takers for at least 20 months that the economy matters more to them than anything else.
 
'Driven by the Economy'
 "This election is going to be driven by the economy," said Max M. Fisher, the Detroit real estate man who has been one of the party's most sedulous fund-raisers for decades. "If we can make a convincing case on that, we have a chance to win. If not, I'm afraid that I doubt it.'
So Mr. Bush had to grapple in his speech, and will have to grapple in his campaign, with the slowest growth rate since Herbert Hoover (a name the Republicans would love to banish from political discourse), with the President's broken promise not to raise taxes, and with the budget deficit.
Fickle Fate didn't help him; the biggest jump in more than a decade in the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits for the first time was reported a few hours before the President walked onto the Astrodome podium.
On the first three nights of the convention, the Republicans did their best to change the subject. Abortion, crime, foreign policy, education and health care got copious attention, as expected. Equally predictable were the comparisons of George Bush's big-time experience to Bill Clinton's lack of it, and the unanimous assertion that the President was therefore more worthy of trust than the Democrat.
The surprise was the searing intensity of the attacks, under the guise of defending "family values," on homosexuals and on Hillary Clinton. They and the supporters of abortion rights are the designated infidels of the Republicans' cultural crusaders.
"Americans try to raise their children to understand right and wrong," Mr. Quayle said, "only to be told that every so-called 'life-style alternative' is morally equivalent. That is wrong. The gap between us and our opponents is a cultural divide. It is not just a difference between conservative and liberal, it is a difference between fighting for what is right and refusing to see what is wrong."
Ward and June Cleaver are no longer archetypes; only a quarter of American households are two-parent homes with children. Nonetheless, they account for more than half of all Americans over the age of 25, and they are not only more likely to vote than the population as a whole, but also more conservative.
 
Life Through a Soft Lens
 The Republicans, however, are casting their "family values" nets even more widely than that.
Sometimes people can be persuaded to view life through a soft lens and vote for a nostalgic image they never knew. The Republicans and Mr. Bush tried for that this week, betting that the country longs for and identifies with Cleaverism the way it longed for and identified with a Hollywood version of small-town America in the Reagan years. Mr. Quayle evoked both tonight, as did Barbara Bush last night, surrounded by children and grandchildren.
If that makes people forget their economic woes, or assign them a lower priority, the President may benefit. But it is easy to overdo the social-issue approach. Poll data suggest that most voters think homosexuals should be protected from job discrimination and harassment, even if they do not approve of their sexual orientation, so gay-bashing has its perils. So does Hillary-taunting, if the electorate comes to see it as intolerance of working women in general.
Already, the party's hard line on abortion has cost votes, although it is impossible even to estimate how many. A prominent Republican woman who favors abortion rights said all the right things in an interview today, promising to vote for Mr. Bush because "he is right on so many other things." When the on-the-record interview ended she changed her tune, promising that "they'll get theirs this fall when we vote for Clinton."
 
Clues, but Not Road Maps
 Conventions provide clues to the campaigns that follow them, not detailed road maps thereof.
Mr. Bush is not obliged to advocate everything the Republican platform does, let alone everything said by the featured orators here this week. He is hardly likely, for example, to endorse Patrick J. Buchanan's praise for "force, rooted in justice, backed by courage" as a means of dealing with racial unrest.
But the President he will not be able entirely to eradicate, even if he should want to, the tenor of negativism created by this week's events, and that worries the governors and former governors of the big states all across the country where the cultural boundaries are much less distinct.
It worries them because of voters like Scott Epelbaum of Columbus, Ohio, who runs a private security agency. Interviewed at the Ohio State Fair this week, he said he wished the Republicans "would talk about something other than morals and Murphy Brown and my bedroom," especially the economy.
Usually a Republican, he plans to vote for Mr. Clinton, he said. "I dont know if he's better, but he's no worse, and he's different."
In a year when voters seem unusually hungry for answers to intractable problems, this week's attack politics could cost the Republicans some votes while gaining them others. That helps explain the absence of some vulnerable office-holders, like Gov. Pete Wilson of California, and the relative invisibility of others, like Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania.
Contrary to some assertions, this was not the bitterest Republican convention in modern memory. While there were more splits on major issues than at any convention in the last quarter-century -- abortion and the economy, to name just two -- they were kept largely below stairs.
No prominent Republican rose to attack another, the way Everett McKinley Dirksen denounced Thomas E. Dewey at Chicago in 1952 as the man who had too often taken the party "down the path to defeat," and no Republican moderate was booed as was Nelson A. Rockefeller on the dais in San Francisco in 1964.
"We weren't about to let democracy break out on the floor," said Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr., a former Republican chairman. "We've learned over the last 10 or 20 years that that's bad for your political health."
The Democrats will try at every turn to drag the discussion back to the economy. Mr. Bush is unlikely to get any significant help between now and Election Day from the numbers-crunchers; Allen Sinai, the chief economist at the Boston Company, an investment advisory firm, said, "It's hard to see anything that's going to snap the economy back between now and November."
No President in this century has been re-elected with an economy that has performed as poorly as the economy is and has been performing in the last year. Mr. Bush must hope that the nation will believe his new campaign manager, James A. Baker 3d, when he promises that the President can learn to hit the big-league economic curve ball if only he is given another chance.

HEADLINE: Cry for Brazil

 BODY:
The Western Hemisphere's second-largest country is in an uproar. Fernando Collor de Mello, Brazil's first freely elected President since the 1960's, is accused of widespread corruption and faces impeachment. To stay in office he is recklessly dispensing patronage, despite surging inflation and international commitments to austerity.
It is for Brazilians, not Americans, to decide Mr. Collor's political future. Washington's interest is in continued democracy and economic recovery, not personalities. Fortunately, all sides pledge to follow constitutional procedures. But economic recovery is threatened in any event -- through the profligacy of Mr. Collor or his replacement by an untested Vice President, Itamar Franco. 
 Mr. Collor is currently being investigated by a congressional panel on charges that he tolerated a vast influence-peddling and kickback scheme run by one of his closest associates, Paulo Cesar Farias, and received millions of dollars from Mr. Farias for household expenses. This comes at a time when most Brazilians remain mired in shocking poverty and involves a President who rode to office on a promise to rout governmental corruption.
The congressional findings are expected to be highly critical of Mr. Collor. Impeachment requires a two-thirds vote. With no large party of his own, he is shopping for support. His ministers have even begun to solicit requests for new spending.
This fiscal binge comes as Brazil has just begun to win back international financial credibility despite a foreign debt of $123 billion, the developing world's highest, and an inflation rate close to 250 percent, the highest in Latin America. Marcilio Marques Moreira, the Economy Minister, recently negotiated deals with the International Monetary Fund and foreign banks that hinge on continued fiscal and monetary austerity. Ballooning deficit spending could compel him to resign.
Brazilians may be forced to choose between keeping an elected President who has put his own future ahead of the country's or replacing him with his carelessly chosen running mate. Either way, Mr. Collor has embarrassed Brazil.

HEADLINE: In Today's Russia Too, the Rich Get Richer

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"How to Take Over the Store" (The Week in Review, Aug. 2) -- a success story of a Russian store manager, Natalya Maloletneva, turned proprietor of the store -- blurs some fundamental detail, which, I am afraid, leaves your readers in the dark about the basic prerequisite for such a success in the Commonwealth of Independent States. 
 Ms. Maloletneva paid 2.2 million rubles to purchase the Lyudmila store from the state. This was "roughly three or four months of profit" of the store -- one of the most popular women's clothing stores in Moscow. Since the store's staff savings were insufficient to collect such a sum, Ms. Maloletneva withheld the shop's sales revenues and did not turn them over to the appropriate state authority. The equivalent of such behavior in this country would be a company's not paying its taxes to the United States Treasury. Everybody here knows what the consequences are likely to be.
In Moscow, Ms. Maloletneva was able to get away with it, and now she proudly boasts to your correspondent about such "violation of the rules," as she innocently puts it. This shows to what extent law enforcement is nonexistent in Russia today.
Next Ms. Maloletneva personally bought 4 of the 24 shares of the corporation that now owns Lyudmila. For this she paid 60,000 rubles "from her savings and those of her husband."
For many years, I was a Moscow professor in the highly paid academic profession. For me to accumulate 60,000 rubles, I would have to save my total salary to the last kopek for 10 years. I am sure that very few honest working families in Russia, with the exception of the narrow circle of popular authors or movie stars, could have saved that much money, even if one of the wage earners was a colonel in the Soviet army. From this it follows that Ms. Maloletneva, being a manager of a big store, managed to cream off the top and bottom of each transaction, as is usually done in Russian commerce. This is where the bulk of her savings had to come from.
I write not to pass moral judgment on Ms. Maloletneva and her ilk. For 99 percent of the Russian population such a method of "privatization" is out of reach. What Ms. Maloletneva did is now called the "nomenklatura" privatization: the managers of state stores, restaurants and enterprises by hook or by crook lay their hands on state ("people's") property, while the majority of the population is being pauperized.
And that explains the widening gap between the rulers and the ruled in the process of that "popular democratic revolution" whose anniversary the Russian people will "celebrate" with tap water at the end of this month.

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
Merchants of Hate

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

DATELINE: HOUSTON

 BODY:
"GOP Needs a Kremlin to Bash," the lead headline in The Chicago Tribune said the day before the convention. It neatly stated the seeming dilemma of a Republican Party that for 40 years had made a theme of denouncing the Democrats as soft on Communism.
But the collapse of the Soviet Union did not faze Pat Buchanan, Pat Robertson or the others who speak for the Republican Party today. They bashed the un-Christian and the un-straight. They bashed Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton. And they even managed to flog the Red menace. 
 If the Democrats won this election, Republican chairman Rich Bond suggested, Jane Fonda would be sleeping in the White House "as guest of honor at a state dinner for Fidel Castro."
The sleaze was so thick on the ground here in Houston, the attacks so far-fetched, that some people may be tempted to dismiss them as funny. Not I. I remember Joe McCarthy. I have been going to national political conventions since his day, and I do not recall one as mean in spirit as this one.
God was much spoken of. But He was a God without compassion, a God of intolerance.
If the official Republican platform is carried out, a 13-year-old girl who becomes pregnant as a result of being raped by her father and has an abortion could end in the gas chamber. The platform says that every abortion, whatever the reason, however early in the pregnancy, is the unjustified killing of a human being. For the woman and the doctor, no mercy.
The 1964 Republican Convention, which nominated Barry Goldwater, has until now been regarded as the angriest in its tone. Delegates shouted down Nelson Rockefeller and attacked the press.
But Barry Goldwater is a moderate compared with those in charge now. In fact former Senator Goldwater opposed the party's 1992 position on abortion as politically disastrous.
The Houston convention was significant in a number of ways. First, it marked a big advance in influence by the religious right.
The Democrats this year did much to erase their reputation for yielding to special interests outside the party. But the Republican Party has actually been taken over to a remarkable extent by the special interests of the hard right and religious conservatives, who worked precinct by precinct to capture state delegations.
The success of the extremists was evident in the choice of the two Pats, Buchanan and Robertson, to address the convention. But even the supposed moderates, like Rich Bond, shrilled themselves up.
The nastiness had a purpose, and that was the second significant point in the convention. The idea was to take people's minds off the real issue in the 1992 election: the economic suffering of millions of Americans.
Conservatives came to power when Ronald Reagan combined right-wing social ideas with a new economic idea: the supply-side miracle. The Government would cut taxes, increase spending and balance the budget.
The result has been to push the world's richest country toward bankruptcy, and to leave the average American earning less in real terms than he or she was 12 years ago.
That is why Republicans on and off the floor talked about everything they could to get people's minds off jobs and pay and their hopes for their children -- that is, real subjects.
Day after day some Bush surrogate spoke of Governor Clinton's sex life. But probably nastiest of all were the references to Mrs. Clinton.
Literature sold in the Republican "Spirit of America" hall next to the arena called Mrs. Clinton a "femi nazi." The Reverend Robertson said she and her husband were out to "destroy the traditional family." That of a woman whose efforts to help children learn were praised by the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy in a 1989 book.
Of course every effort was made to keep President Bush above the slime -- to give him deniability. He sounded Presidential. But anyone who thinks his attack dogs were acting on their own must believe in Peter Pan.
Will the meanness work? I doubt it, though it was effective in 1988. In any event, Republicans might remember that Lee Atwater, the 1988 chairman, apologized before he died last year for what he called his "naked cruelty."

HEADLINE: REPUBLICANS IN HOUSTON - MAN IN THE NEWS;
A Vice President Who Has Been Tested: James Danforth Quayle 3d

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Aug. 20

 BODY:
Patrick J. Buchanan was about to deliver his most memorable zinger, the line about how Gov. Bill Clinton "sat up in a dormitory in Oxford, England, and figured out how to dodge the draft." An impish producer at NBC News, who had an advance text of Mr. Buchanan's Monday night speech to the Republican convention, ordered the cameras trained on Vice President Dan Quayle.
As the Astrodome crowd erupted in cheers, Mr. Quayle sat stiff and expressionless, his eyes shifting self-consciously to the left and then to the right. The camera lingered. Mr. Quayle, whose own candidacy was bombarded by questions about the draft four years earlier, did not smile. 
 Even as Mr. Quayle wages an aggressive campaign to reintroduce himself to the electorate, the old demons, it seems, are always lurking.
This time it happened on a night when both President Bush and former President Ronald Reagan went out of their way to bolster Mr. Quayle's promise of a "new Dan Quayle," portraying him as a leader who has been severely tested. Mr. Reagan called him "someone who has repeatedly stood up for his deepest convictions." Mr. Bush added, "This guy stood there in the face of those unfair critics and he has never wavered."
 
Moving Forward, Sliding Back
 Indeed, Mr. Quayle has been tested unlike virtually any other American politician, forced to spend four years chipping away at the devastating caricature created in the first week of his 1988 campaign. And yet, each time Mr. Quayle has given the country reason to take him seriously, he has said something, done something or spelled something that instantly reversed the progress and fed the stereotype.
In June, just as he was riding a public relations boost provided by a favorable series of articles in The Washington Post, he made one of the most embarrassing goofs of his tenure by misspelling the word "potato" at a grade school spelling bee.
And misfortune struck twice this week, producing smirking headlines. First he confused the year of the next Presidential election. "Let us see George Bush re-elected this November and then we'll talk about 1994," he said in a CNN interview on Tuesday. Then he misspoke in a speech Wednesday about term limits. "This is not a bipartisan issue because Democrats, Republicans and independents support term limitations," he said.
Each time it happens, Mr. Quayle's aides and allies wince at the prospect of lost momentum. "It just seems that whenever he gets his head above water and gets a couple of breaths of air, the next wave comes crashing down on him," said Senator Daniel R. Coats, a former aide to Mr. Quayle who succeeded him as Indiana's Republican junior Senator.
 
A Risk-Taking Activist
 Although he is now 45 years of age, with a wisp of gray at his temples and crow's feet at the corners of his gleaming blue eyes, Mr. Quayle still has an unmarked look that cartoonists exploit to suggest an inner vacuity.
The Vice President says he has been as loyal to Mr. Bush as Mr. Bush was to Mr. Reagan. But unlike Vice President Bush, Vice President Quayle has been an aggressive, risk-taking activist, knowing he can only overcome his reputation for buffoonery by 1996 if he establishes a serious record of his own.
To that end, he has become the Bush Administration's lead emissary to the Republican right. He has converted his office into a war room for the Administration's battle against government regulation, transforming the Council on Competitiveness, which he heads, into a policy-making body that is both respected and feared.
He has become inseparably identified with the Republican crusade on "family values." But unlike former Education Secretary William J. Bennett, who defined family values in cogent and specific terms when he nominated Mr. Quayle on Wednesday night, the Vice President's oratory on the issue rarely moves beyond platitudes about "hard work, integrity and personal responsibility."
 
Some Notes of Vitality
 For much of the time in the last few months, Mr. Quayle and his coterie of neoconservative aides injected one of the few notes of vitality into the Bush-Quayle campaign. Before the convention, at least, they formed an independent power base within the White House, often acting without the knowledge or approval of Mr. Bush or his handlers, and often making the President look drowsy by comparison.
And yet, Mr. Quayle's public approval ratings have continued to slide to an all-time low. As the Bush-Quayle campaign floundered last month, Mr. Quayle became a natural scapegoat. Even those who argued for keeping him on the ticket rarely did so by cataloguing his political strengths.
The perception of the Vice President as a bumbler limits his effectiveness in the campaign. When he assails the Democratic ticket, for example, aides to Mr. Clinton dismiss his message by ridiculing the messenger.
 
1988 Convention Scrutiny
 Mr. Quayle spent this week racing through a frantic schedule of 20 public appearances, as against four by Mr. Bush, all intended to highlight the attributes that were so thoroughly obscured at the 1988 convention by stories about his enlistment in the Indiana National Guard instead of being drafted or volunteering for active duty in the Vietnam War, even though he personally approved American involvement in that war. He was also subjected to intense scrutiny of his mediocre academic record and his family's wealth.
After four years Mr. Quayle can justifiably add at least one meaningful line to his political resume: He is a survivor. Republican leaders maintain that even Richard M. Nixon did not suffer the level of attack by journalists and comedians that Mr. Quayle has endured. And unlike the former President, Mr. Quayle has shown remarkable resilience without public displays of either bitterness or vengeance.
"I'm sure he's learned what hell is," said Senator Alan K. Simpson, Republican of Wyoming. "He's been bombarded with more stuff than anybody I've known since I came to Washington, and I admire the way he's taken the heat."
 
Chance to Prove Himself
 Like a jujitsu master, Mr. Quayle has learned to turn his disadvantages into advantages. Rather than indulging the politician's instinct for denial, he concedes that he is the object of ridicule, and then argues that this has given him the chance to prove himself in battle, in Washington if not in Vietnam.
"I stand before you and before the American people -- unbowed, unbroken and ready to keep fighting for our beliefs," Mr. Quayle said in his acceptance speech tonight.
In rebutting his critics, Mr. Quayle has constructed a demonology of evildoers, ranging from the news media to the American Bar Association, who he maintains are responsible for the deterioration of the economy, the family and his own reputation. The argument sells well with conservative Republicans, who readily embrace Mr. Quayle's contention that an offense to one is an offense to all.
"The elites laughed at the reference to Murphy Brown and sneered at my defense of basic values," Mr. Quayle said on Monday in a speech to Pat Robertson's Christian Coalition. "But it wasn't just me they were laughing at, my friends. It was you and your families and your values."
Inherent in the case made by Mr. Quayle and his allies is the view that few of his wounds have been self-inflicted. Mr. Quayle's wife, Marilyn, blames the press for his problems.
"There was a great deal invested in Dan Quayle's being portrayed as someone out of nowhere, that he was a lightweight, instead of really looking at his Senate career and what he'd accomplished there," Mrs. Quayle said last week in an interview at the Vice-Presidential residence in Washington. "His Senate record is far more substantive in real accomplishment and creativity than Al Gore's is, but you don't hear that because we never played the stroke-the-media bit."
 
Childhood in Two States
 James Danforth Quayle 3d was born in Indianapolis on Feb. 4, 1947, the eldest of the four children of James C. and Corinne Pulliam Quayle. Mr. Quayle's maternal grandfather was Eugene C. Pulliam, whose publishing organization included conservative newspapers in Indiana and Arizona.
Mr. Quayle divided his childhood in those two states. He received a B.A. degree from DePauw University and a law degree from the Indiana University School of Law. It was at law school that he met Marilyn Tucker, a classmate whom he married 10 weeks after their first date. The Quayles, who are Presbyterian, have three children -- Tucker, 18, Ben, 15, and Corinne, 13.
After graduating from law school in 1974, the couple opened a law practice in Huntington, Ind., where Mr. Quayle's father published the family paper. While Mr. Quayle was working as associate publisher, local Republican leaders recruited him to run for Congress.
He upset his Democratic opponent, served two terms, and then ran for the Senate in 1980, when he upset the Democratic incumbent, Birch Bayh. Mr. Quayle was re-elected by a large margin in 1986 and then was chosen as a running mate in 1988 by Mr. Bush, who wanted to balance the ticket with youth, conservatism and a Midwesterner.
As Vice President, Mr. Quayle has aggressively pursued an agenda that includes calls for parental school choice, civil justice reform, term limitations for Congress and environmental deregulation.
 
Enemy of Environmentalists
 He maintains that the Council on Competitiveness has saved consumers and small businesses tens of billions of dollars. But in the process, he has become a mortal enemy of environmentalists, who complain that he has weakened regulations intended to preserve open land and limit pollution.
With an eye on 1996, Mr. Quayle has enthusiastically pursued the traditional party-building duties that go with being Vice President, appearing at hundreds of events for Congressional candidates and helping to raise nearly $30 million for his party's candidates.
And he has assembled a staff that is widely admired in Washington for its political acumen. But the abilities of his aides, and particularly his chief of staff, William Kristol, have led to reports that Mr. Quayle is the puppet of underlings preoccupied with their own political and ideological ambitions.
"Look, you've got people out there who are not going to give me credit for anything," Mr. Quayle said. "So now that they've got to give me grudging credit for doing a competent job as Vice President, they don't want to give me the credit so they just say, 'Oh, well, it's someone else.' Well, who do you think makes these decisions? Who hires these people? Who encourages them to come up with ideas?"
He added: "On the other hand, you can take it as a backhanded compliment that we're having an impact. And that's important."

HEADLINE: America West Airlines Shrinks to Try to Survive

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TEMPE, Ariz.

 BODY:
In the logo of America West Airlines, the stylized initials suggest a lovely burgundy sun flying over mountain peaks. But for the present at least, a more appropriate symbol might be the creosote bush, a desert shrub that survives droughts by shedding a branch at a time, cutting back just enough to sustain life until rain returns.
The last big airline to be founded since deregulation of the industry in 1978, America West has had no choice in recent months but to cut back again and again, shedding planes, employees and even its founder. 
 It is burdened now by a $1.2 billion debt, has been operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy laws since June 1991 and is struggling to convince travelers and creditors that it will not go the way of Pan Am, Eastern, Midway, People Express and Braniff.
"There is no question America West is going to make it," Michael J. Conway, the carrier's president and chief executive, said during a recent interview at corporate headquarters here in suburban Phoenix. His optimism was fueled by recent agreements with GPA Group P.L.C., the airline's main supplier of leased planes, and with a consortium of Phoenix-based businesses, for $43 million in new loans.
 
Dangers in the Economy
 "But if we run into serious deterioration of the economy or high fuel costs," he said, "it could still be very difficult."
Some analysts think it is already very difficult. "The funding amounts to a life extension of three more months," said Samuel Buttrick, an airline analyst with Kidder, Peabody & Company. "But America West has extremely limited resources and little in the way of unencumbered assets to generate cash for funding continuing operating losses."
The nine-year-old carrier has run on red ink in six of those years and in the last eight consecutive quarters. In the second quarter of 1992 it suffered a net loss of $33.4 million, compared with $30.9 million a year earlier, in part, officials say, because of the negative impact of the lower industrywide fares introduced by American Airlines in April.
Equally troubling, America West's traffic was off 13.3 percent through July compared with the first seven months of 1991, despite a half-price sale that has generated record boardings for many airlines this summer.
But Mr. Conway, 47 years old, the Brooklyn-born son of a New York City taxi driver, predicts a turnaround in the fourth quarter, barring another war in the Persian Gulf, high fuel costs or other such problems. By then he expects the economy to pick up and the carrier to benefit from cost-cutting measures intended to save more than $100 million.
He also said he expected an infusion of at least another $137 million of equity from the suppliers of America West's planes and other sources, including the Boeing Company, GE Capital and Ansett Worldwide Aviation Services, a unit of Transpacific Enterprises Inc. of Australia. GPA Group, the principal supplier of aircraft, and these other companies own about 40 percent of America West's fleet, and they helped the carrier through a cash shortage last year by deferring $100 million in payments. In addition, GPA gave the airline another $35 million in what is called debtor-in-possession financing last year, while Kawasaki Leasing International Inc. added a $23 million DIP and Northwest Airlines put up $20 million.
"The new money gives the business plan a chance to work, but it will be a tough call," Edward R. Beauvais, America West's founder, said in interview in reference to the $45 million.
Mr. Beauvais (pronounced Bo-vay) stepped down as chief executive in September and as chairman last month. Although people involved with the airline say he was forced by the airline's creditors to step aside, Mr. Beauvais, 55, said only: "When a company is not doing well you really can't have two leaders, because the prospects of additional financing are better with one. It also demonstrates that the welfare of the company is more important than that of any single individual."
 
Hard-Pressed Work Force
 To America West workers who have been let go, that statement might well have a hollow ring. For that matter American West employees, widely recognized as highly dedicated and adaptable, have long been paid less than their industry co-workers, and substantially less than Mr. Beauvais, who made almost $1 million in 1990.
According to a report by Roberts & Associates Inc. of Hayward, Calif., prepared for a group of America West shareholders critical of company management, the carrier's average employee earned $25,210 in 1990 -- 45 percent that of the average Delta employee and 61 percent that of the average Southwest employee. Since that report, employees' salaries were cut 10 percent across the board (with senior management taking far bigger pay cuts).
Moreover, in part to help compensate for low salaries, employees were required to buy stock in the carrier amounting to 20 percent of their first year's salary. Thus employees hold about 20 percent of America West's 23 million shares of common stock, which is now virtually worthless.
That stock is likely to be totally worthless before long, since the carrier said it was contemplating swapping debt for equity. "But at the time of reorganization, hopefully early next year," said Alphonse E. Frei, the carrier's chief financial officer, "it is anticipated employees will be given a meaningful stake in the new company."
Yet the morale of employees who have survived the periodic cutbacks, which will have cut its 15,000-member work force to 10,200 by the end of the year, remains surprisingly high. "We all have our fingers crossed that we'll make it," said Scott Johnson, a flight attendant, during a recent nonstop flight from New York to Phoenix. "This is a good airline and it deserves to survive."
Management is also reducing its fleet size from 123 planes to 86. By January, it will have dropped flights to 20 of its 50 cities, including Des Moines and Moline, Ill.
And it is also talking with Phoenix officials about reducing gates, ticket counters and office space at Sky Harbor International Airport, the airline's main hub, on which it pays $2.2 million a month in rent.
In April it sold its Honolulu-Nagoya, Japan, route to Northwest for $15 million. And while awaiting Federal Aviation Administration approval to substitute a two-engine Boeing 757 for its current four-engine Boeing 747 between Phoenix and Honolulu, the carrier will essentially contract that nonstop service to American Trans Air, beginning Sept. 16. Trans Air's three-engine Lockheed L-1011 will burn 1,100 gallons of fuel an hour less than the 747.
 
Too Far, Too Fast
 Within the industry, mention of Honolulu and Japan invites criticism that America West, initially a regional carrier serving five cities with three aircraft and 280 employees, expanded too far too fast. It even bid for the Eastern shuttle, losing out to Donald Trump.
Mr. Beauvais never met an airline route he didn't like is how some describe it.
While acknowledging that the route to Japan proved disastrous, both he and Mr. Conway defend the strategy that carried them there. By their separate accounts, America West had to grow to stave off a takeover. Then it had to expand into important markets from San Francisco to New York to compete with other carriers' frequent-flier programs. Then it had to add Honolulu, the most popular frequent-flier destination.
As for Japan, Mr. Beauvais conceded, "Had I known the economic cycle would have been so severe, I would never have bought that route."
The airline began that service about the time the gulf war broke out. "Almost immediately international traffic plummeted," Mr. Frei said, "and the Japanese Government advised its citizens to avoid American carriers."
 
Understandable Strategy
 Timothy Pettee, transportation analyst with Alliance Capital Management, said the carrier's strategy was not hard to understand, however. "Everybody had unbridled optimism about the Pacific market," he said, "and had it continued to grow at the expected 12 percent a year their sins would have been overlooked. In retrospect, their timing couldn't have been worse."
Similarly, the decision to open a hub in Columbus was based on getting close to the populous cities of the East and Midwest, in a market that is itself the headquarters of many corporate headquarters or plants. The goal was to attract more business travelers, who pay higher fares than the discretionary leisure travelers who dominate America West's Phoenix and Las Vegas hubs.
But not only did the lingering recession stifle business travel, in April, but the industry also adopted American Airlines' simplified fare structure, which reduced first-class and full-coach fares up to 38 percent. But in the spring -- six months after America West opened its Columbus hub -- no-frills Southwest Airlines showed up there, complete with its usual frequent flights and low-cost fares.
In the long term, America West can make money in Columbus, analysts say, but much less and at a far slower pace than its corporate game plan called for.
Publicly at least, Mr. Conway, a former marine, remains gung ho about America West's prospects.
"No one else has going for it what we have," he said, ticking off the carrier's motivated work force, modern fleet, a perfect safety record and unit operating costs that he says will soon be the lowest in the industry. "We've also carved out a niche," he said, "that isn't a direct frontal attack against a major competitor."
Whether or not the retrenchment is too late, Alliance Capital's Mr. Pettee sees an important lesson: "The swiftness with which their fortunes declined is a grim reminder to all airline investors."

HEADLINE: UNDER THE DOME: THE OVERVIEW;
BUSH PROMISES ACROSS-THE-BOARD TAX CUT AND AN ECONOMIC REVIVAL IN A SECOND TERM

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Aug. 20

 BODY:
President Bush tonight appealed for a second term with a promise of new, across-the-board tax cuts next year, a pledge to control Government spending and an attack on his opponent, Gov. Bill Clinton, as a throwback to failed Democratic policies at home and abroad.
Mr. Bush, accepting his party's nomination here before 2,210 delegates in the Houston Astrodome, presented himself as a tested leader on the world stage who was now committed to waging the struggle for economic revival at home. 
 He proudly claimed credit for helping usher in the sweeping changes of the last four years, from the unification of Germany to the commencement of Arab-Israeli peace talks, from the easing of conflict in Central America to the collapse of the Soviet Union.
"The world changes for which we've sacrificed for a generation have finally come to pass," Mr. Bush said, "and with them a rare and unprecedented opportunity to pass the sweet cup of prosperity around our American table." [Transcript, pages A14-A15.]
 
Admits Erring On Taxes
 He apologized for breaking his "no new taxes" pledge of 1988, but he cast his acceptance of the 1990 budget agreement, which included new taxes, as a one-time error. Seeking to reclaim the Republicans' political advantage as the party of fiscal restraint, Mr. Bush declared, "Who do you trust in this election? The candidate who raised taxes one time and regrets it, or the other candidate, who raised taxes and fees 128 times, and enjoyed it every time?"
This speech, capping the final night of the 35th Republican National Convention, did not reach the emotional heights that Mr. Bush attained in 1988, when his acceptance speech was widely hailed as the "speech of a lifetime." Mr. Bush was forced onto the defensive by an ailing economy, and he went into great detail blaming a "gridlock Democratic Congress" for blunting the promise of his current term.
But this partisan audience and his beaming advisers clearly thought he had succeeded in the essential chore of softening up Mr. Clinton and his poll ratings before the long slog through September and October. For that reason, the 58-minute address veered sharply from the visionary tone of its opening passage to the routine battering of a typical campaign speech.
 
Promises to Propose Cuts
 On balance, Mr. Bush seemed to have more energy for defending his record and for assailing his opponents than for laying down a roadmap for a second term.
In promising to call for new across-the-board reductions in taxes when Congress returns next year, Mr. Bush said he would insure that they were tied to spending reductions so they did not increase the deficit. The President said he would propose several actions to cut spending, including vetoing any appropriations bill that exceeded his budget request and pushing for a cap on mandatory spending programs like Medicare, Medicaid and veterans' benefits.
 
Defends Economic Record
 But he did not specify which taxes he would reduce or which mandatory spending programs he would cap.
In contrast, Mr. Bush said of Mr. Clinton, "His passion to expand government knows no bounds." Throughout his speech, Mr. Bush said this election would pose a "sharp choice" between policies, philosophies and character, and he presented Mr. Clinton as a man committed to taxing, spending, and ever bigger government.
The audience chanted, "Hit him again, harder, harder!" and "Thank you, George!"
Mr. Bush sought to defend his economic record of the last four years, which many polls suggest is at the heart of his political difficulties. Echoing a theme struck here throughout the week, Mr. Bush said the Democratic-controlled Congress had blocked his package to spur economic growth.
"I extended my hand to the Democratic leaders, and they bit it," he said.
 
Cites Foreign Policy
 He also proudly declared that the fall of Communism during the last four years was not an accident but rather a result of strong Republican stewardship, and he warned that Mr. Clinton was untested and unprepared for the job of Commander in Chief.
"My opponents say I spend too much time on foreign policy," Mr. Bush told his audience of roaring, flag-waving Republicans. "I saw the chance to rid our children's dreams of the nuclear nightmare, and I did. I seized those opportunities for our kids and our grandkids, and I make no apologies for that."
Here, as on the issue of the economy, Mr. Bush asserted that Mr. Clinton was tied to failed Democratic philosophies. "While the U.S. postwar strategy was largely bipartisan, the fact remains that the liberal, McGovern wing of the other party -- including my opponent -- consistently made the wrong choices."
 
Recalls Gulf War Leadership
 Mr. Bush also proudly recounted his conduct of the war in the Persian Gulf, and scoffed at his opponent's ability to do the same. "What about the leader of the Arkansas National Guard, the man who hopes to be Commander in Chief?" he asked. "Well, while I bit the bullet, he bit his nails."
Mr. Bush's speech clearly defined the coming battle over the economy, and the Clinton campaign quickly asserted that Mr. Bush's promise of new tax cuts was irresponsible and as politically motivated as his "no new taxes" promise four years ago.
George Stephanopoulos, the communications director for the Clinton campaign, asserted, "The President said he would do anything to get re-elected, and he obviously meant it. This makes 'read my lips' look truthful and responsible."
The President said this election presented two distinct visions on how to insure the nation's economic security. "Theirs is to look inward, and protect what we already have," he said. "Ours is to look forward -- to open new markets, prepare our people to compete, to restore the social fabric, to save and invest so we can win."
He said his approach to change, the issue Mr. Clinton has claimed, would emphasize open markets, less Government spending, tax relief, opportunities for small business, "reform" of the legal and health-care systems, job training and better schools.
 
The Mark of Baker
 The speech was two minutes longer than Mr. Clinton's acceptance speech at Madison Square Garden last month. It seemed to bear the distinctive mark of Mr. Bush's new chief of staff, James A. Baker 3d, who arrived in Houston last night and spent the day working on the text in what aides described as a frantic series of rewrites.
In past campaigns, Mr. Baker has favored making a few precisely targeted proposals and then using repetition and a tough, combative campaign to drive them home. Mr. Baker, currently the Secretary of State, takes over at the White House on Monday, but he is already in control of the campaign's tactics.
The speech did not, however, include one proposal floated earlier in the week that would have had Mr. Baker assume the role of domestic policy czar in a second Bush term.
Among the economic measures Mr. Bush proposed was a checkoff on tax returns that would allow taxpayers to designate 10 percent of their payment for cutting the national debt. He did not explain how such a proposal would work.
 
'A Cultural Divide
 Vice President Dan Quayle, in his acceptance speech tonight, presented himself as a proud warrior for traditional values and for morality itself, standing tall against the mockery and hostility of the Democrats and the "elites" of Hollywood and the news media.
"The gap between us and our opponents is a cultural divide," he said. "It is not just a difference between conservative and liberal. It is a difference between fighting for what is right and refusing to see what is wrong."
The Vice President's speech, with its implicit notion that the Republicans had better morals than their Democratic counterparts, gave the convention's final night a razor's edge.
The Vice President assailed Governor Clinton as the creature of "special interests," including the "education lobby," trial lawyers and the news media. "He can't fight for the traditional family, because his supporters in Hollywood and the media elite won't let him," Mr. Quayle declared.
Former President Gerald R. Ford brought a personal touch to a comparison the Republicans have been seeking all week, noting that he lost in 1976 to another Democrat who promised change. "Remember, change isn't a magic word that makes everything rosy," Mr. Ford said. "Change may get you 13 percent inflation. Change may get you a 17 percent home mortgage rate."
Even before Mr. Bush took the stage tonight, Republicans were cheered by three new polls that showed the convention had already tightened the race for the Presidency, which kicked off a rough new Republican assault on the Democratic nominee's character and an attempt to portray him as outside the mainstream of American life.
 
Jockeying for 1996
 There were many subplots here this week, despite the often plodding nature of the proceedings on the floor, which left even some delegates grumbling about the level of Republican oratory after Ronald Reagan had reminded them of their glory days on Monday.
One of the principal plot lines was the jockeying for position for 1996. Mr. Quayle, who has struggled for four years to establish himself as a serious political player, was clearly trying to use this moment of national attention to maximum advantage.
Mr. Quayle described himself as "unbowed, unbroken, and ready to keep fighting for our beliefs," and he presented his trials as the inevitable result of challenging the cultural elites. He also sought a lighter touch, telling a favorite Quayle joke on himself.
"For more than a month, the media have been telling us that Bill Clinton and Al Gore are 'moderates,' " Mr. Quayle said. "Well, if they're moderates, I'm a world champion speller."
 
Economy the Central IssueElection's Central Theme
 Mr. Bush and his advisers wrestled to the very end with tonight's speech; it was crucial to making an affirmative case for his re-election after a convention that had often seemed more occupied with presenting the case against his opponent. Moreover, it was up to Mr. Bush to come to grips with the central issue of this election so far: the economy.
Reviewing the tenor of this convention, Mr. Clinton's strategists said they hoped the Republicans had spent so much time cultivating their conservative base that they would pay a price with voters in the center. "Do I think they're going to get a 6-point bounce out of this convention?" said Stan Greenberg, the polltaker for the Clinton campaign. "At least. But I think they laid down some markers here that will eventually alienate the swing voters they need."
Mr. Clinton himself tried to stoke that alienation as he campaigned in Michigan today, where he said that "the party of Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt and Dwight Eisenhower is not very much in evidence in Houston this week."
Still, The new polls made public tonight showed that the convention was giving Mr. Bush a substantial boost. A New York Times/CBS News Poll taken just before the convention showed Mr. Clinton with a 17-point lead among likely voters. A new one, by CBS News, which surveyed 1,204 registered voters on Tuesday and Wednesday, showed that Mr. Clinton's lead had narrowed to 9 percentage points. The poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
Mr. Bush was the choice of 37 percent of those surveyed, while Mr. Clinton had the backing of 46 percent. When undecided voters were pushed to voice a preference, the trial heat showed Mr. Bush with 40 percent and Mr. Clinton with 41 percent. The poll suggested that before Mr. Bush took the stage tonight, the Republicans had succeeded in raising doubts about Mr. Clinton, but had done little to improve Mr. Bush's standing.
The other new surveys were by Cable News Network and USA Today and by ABC News, and they showed similar convention benefits for the Republicans.

CORRECTION-DATE: August 22, 1992, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about President Bush's speech at the Republican National Convention misstated a finding of a CBS News poll taken Tuesday and Wednesday. Once undecided voters were pressed to voice a preference between Mr. Bush and Gov. Bill Clinton, they supported Mr. Clinton 51 percent to 40 percent, not 41 percent to 40 percent.

HEADLINE: BAHAMIAN LEADER LOSES IN ELECTION

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NASSAU, Bahamas, Aug. 20

 BODY:
After 25 years in office, the Prime Minister of the Bahamas, Sir Lynden O. Pindling, who led this Caribbean island nation to independence from Britain and in recent years quarreled with the United States, has been swept from power in a parliamentary election held here on Wednesday.
Plagued since the early 1980's by persistent accusations that he has taken bribes from cocaine and marijuana traffickers and saddled more recently with an economic decline that has left thousands without jobs, Sir Lynden's Progressive Liberal Party was resoundingly defeated by Hubert Ingraham, a former protege who broke with the party and now heads the Free National Movement. 
 Preliminary election results indicate that the Progressive Liberal Party has lost at least half the 32 seats it held in the 49-member House of Assembly. Arthur Foulkes, press secretary for Mr. Ingraham, a 45-year-old lawyer whose campaign slogan promised "deliverance to the nation," predicted that the Free National Movement would win about 60 percent of the popular vote.
Though clearly shocked by the dimensions of his defeat, which saw several Cabinet Ministers and the Speaker of the House lose their seats, Sir Lynden, whose supporters called him "the Moses of the Bahamas," accepted the rejection of his leadership calmly and without the rancor that characterized the months of campaigning.
"The people of this great little democracy have spoken in a most dignified and elegant manner," he said in a concession speech today. "And the voice of the people is the voice of God."
For his part, Mr. Ingraham vowed in remarks today that the new Government would be more accountable and open to the Bahamian people and "far more receptive to foreign investment" and visitors. "We shall seek to restore the Bahamas as a tourist destination of first choice and insure that people feel comfortable here," he said.
There were basically two campaign issues: corruption and recession. Mr. Ingraham, a former Cabinet member who was expelled from the Progressive Liberal Party in 1986 after accusing Sir Lynden and fellow party leaders of corrupt practices, pledged throughout the campaign that he would reform the government from top to bottom.
Sir Lynden, who is 62 years old and has been in office longer than any leader in the Western Hemisphere except Fidel Castro of Cuba, has been vulnerable on the corruption issue since an official 1984 commission of inquiry into drug trafficking through the Bahamas found widespread evidence of corruption in the Prime Minister's Cabinet and the Bahamian police. The commission cleared Sir Lynden of any wrongdoing, but said he and his wife had at least $3.5 million in bank deposits the sources of which could not be accounted for.
At the 1987 Jacksonville trial of Carlos Lehder, a founder of the Medellin cocaine cartel, prosecutors charged that Mr. Lehder and other drug traffickers had paid at least $5 million to Sir Lynden for permission to use the Bahamas as a trans-shipment point for cocaine and marijuana bound for the United States. Several drug smugglers testified that they had made such payments directly to Sir Lynden. The Prime Minister denied the accusations.
 
Drug Dealer's Property
 Mr. Lehder acknowledged that he had purchased Norman's Cay, an island south of Nassau that included a marina, an airstrip, three homes and several airplanes. After his conviction, the United States sought to confiscate Mr. Lehder's holdings here, but was rebuffed by Sir Lynden.
To emphasize Washington's unhappiness on the drug issue, when Ambassador Carol B. Hallett arrived here for the first time after her appointment in 1986, she flew in on a United States Drug Enforcement Administration airplane. After the Progressive Liberal Party won a convincing election victory in 1987, Foreign Minister Clement Maynard said critics in the United States could "go to hell."
Mr. Lehder repeated many of the accusations of the drug payoffs last year, during the trial of Gen. Manual Antonio Noriega of Panama. A few weeks ago, a lawyer who is a friend and business partner of Sir Lynden, Nigel Bowe, who had been indicted in the United States in 1985 on charges he accepted drug payoffs, surrendered to the American authorities in Miami, where he is scheduled to go on trial soon.
For many voters, though, the decline of the economy in the last five years was the decisive factor in the election. Tourism is by far the largest source of employment and revenue in this nation of 255,000 people spread over 700 islands just off Florida, and the Bahamas has found it difficult to compete with other vacation destinations in the Caribbean and North America, even with cut-rate air fares and hotel packages.
 
U.S. Officials Pleased
 State Department officials in Washington, who refused to be identified, said they looked forward to working with Mr. Ingraham. A senior official of Drug Enforcement Administration said that the drug shipments through the Bahamas had been trailing off in recent years, and that the Free National Movement had made clear their opposition to drug trafficking.
"We see no huge changes in our position or joint operations," the senior official said. "We do not operate in the Bahamas with the blessing and approval of just one party. We have an apolitical subject whose suppression is something the Bahamians of all tendencies agree is to their benefit."
Sir Lynden was first elected Prime Minister in 1967, ending a tradition of white minority rule that had been in place for centuries. He devoted his first term of office to securing independence from Britain, which was formally granted in 1973, and used the prestige gained from that accomplishment to win five more elections.
But many first-time voters apparently thought of Sir Lynden not as the father of his country but as a politician of dubious reputation who was unable to find them jobs. Strategists from the Free National Movement said that Sir Lynden had fared worst among young voters and that he had committed a fundamental error by scheduling the vote during the summer, when college students traditionally return from studies overseas.

HEADLINE: New York City Begins Another Search for a Film Chief

BYLINE: By MELINDA HENNEBERGER

 BODY:
Under pressure from an ailing film industry, New York City officials said yesterday that they are starting from scratch in the four-month search for a film commissioner who can woo Hollywood back to New York.
 The choice of a new head for the relatively low-budget office became the subject of intense controversy after local film makers protested that four finalists chosen in June by a nine-person search committee simply were not up to the job. Film and television production is an important business in New York City, where a seven-month strike that ended in May 1991 cost the city half its normal number of production days. This year, the number has continued to decline, slipping 5 percent further. 
Barry F. Sullivan, deputy mayor for finance and economic development, said yesterday that he had agreed to throw out the committee's conclusions and begin again.
 
'Major Source of Revenue'
 "I want to get this right rather than wrong," he said. "It's a major source of revenue." The initial search was too unfocused, he said, adding that it is time to bring in professionals.
 The city hopes to find someone with an intimate knowledge of the business and the kind of Los Angeles ties that will keep New York ahead of the pack when locations are chosen for new projects. Once in New York, film crews need help with permits, access to locations and a host of logistical details. So, the director must also be able to cut negotiate the city bureaucracy, snipping red tape and keeping both artists and officials happy.
 Last evening, a group of 12 local producers, directors and movie union representatives met to craft a job description for the $78,000-a-year position, which was vacated last April. As early as today, Mr. Sullivan said, he would begin turning over a stack of unsolicited resumes to Russell Reynolds Associates, where the head of the executive search agency has volunteered to conduct the search at no cost to the city.
 The job is now filled by an acting director, Nina Streich. But several City Council members say the delay in permanently filling the vacancy is costing the city money. Next Tuesday, the City Council's Intergroup Relations Committee will hold a hearing on why the position has not yet been filled.
 Alan S. Gordon, Eastern executive secretary of the Directors Guild of America, said he will testify at the hearing, urging city officials to "prevent the death of New York City's film production industry."
 Mr. Sullivan said he expects the city to hire a new commissioner by the end of the year. The job is a combination of marketing the city to film producers increasingly leery of New York's high cost and strong unions, and of helping ease the process of film making -- arranging for access, blocking streets and the like.
 Some in the movie business said yesterday that they were enthusiastic about the city's new approach to filling the position.
 "It's the right thing to do to get professionals involved, and the people who've been most affected by the loss of work in the city," said Terry Casaletta, an official of the Director's Guild. Critics in the film business had complained that the original finalists for the job were chosen as friends of those on the search committee rather than as industry insiders capable of lunch as art. The sorry state of the economy only heightened their anxiety.
 Jaynne Keyes, who left the commissioner's post in April -- and headed the original search committee -- defended the process and said any of the four candidates was completely qualified to become director of the Mayor's Office of Film, Theatre and Broadcasting.
 
'Everything Is Incestuous'
 "There weren't any friendships that entered into it," said Ms. Keyes, who is now an agent at William Morris. "We had 50 resumes and each of us took 8 or 10 home with us. Although it is hard in New York, where everything is incestuous."
 Ms. Keyes said the process actually went awry because others in the industry wanted their own friends hired for the job. "Where it messed up was there were people out there that had their own people they wanted, and they started going to the press."
 Two of the four finalists dropped out "when the press hit the fan," she said.
 The remaining candidates were Lori Rosenfield, a former development executive at Fox, who declined to comment on the renewed search, and Caitlin Buchman, a former agent and film consultant who runs Film Strategies. Ms. Buchman could not be reached for comment yesterday. Mr. Sullivan said neither would be excluded from consideration in the new search.
 But meanwhile, Ms. Keyes said, "I worry that nobody's out there selling the city."

CORRECTION-DATE: August 21, 1992, Friday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Aug. 21 about New York City's search for a film com missioner referred incorrectly to a labor dispute in New York last year between the major motion picture studios and film craft union mem bers. The studios boycotted New York for seven months during a con tract dispute over compensation; there was no strike by cinematogra phers and stagehands. An accord was reached last summer. A reader pointed out the error in a letter dated Aug. 31; this correction was delayed by an editing lapse.
