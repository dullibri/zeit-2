HEADLINE: Bucking the Industry

BYLINE: By DUFF WILSON

 BODY:
INDIANAPOLIS -- John C. Lechleiter walks a mile to work every morning to think about the day ahead. He walks home in the evening, he says, ''to try to forget about it.''
These are challenging times for Eli Lilly, the company he leads. It is losing patent protection in the next seven years on drugs that accounted for 74 percent of its sales in 2009, a decline considered to be the worst patent cliff facing major companies in the industry.
And it also had been hit by recent legal, regulatory and research disappointments, including the surprise announcement in August that a promising experimental drug treatment for Alzheimer's was being dropped because it hurt patients' cognitive functions more than it helped.
As a result of the compound issues confronting the company, analysts and others have been pressuring Lilly to undergo major transformations similar to those of its rivals Pfizer and Merck, which made giant purchases of other companies in efforts to diversify and spur growth. 
For Lilly and Dr. Lechleiter, the company's fortunes are not all that is at stake. Its economic health is closely interwoven with its hometown roots here, where it also works with about 3,000 Indiana businesses.
Dr. Lechleiter, a chemist who joined Lilly 31 years ago and was named chief executive in 2008, remains confident of the company's strategy. He asserts that it can retool with in-house research and cost-cutting, rather than resorting to mergers or big acquisitions.
In a wide-ranging interview Tuesday, Dr. Lechleiter held to the company's promise that revenue would not dip below $20 billion even in the expected low-tide year of 2014. He said efforts to trim $1 billion in costs and 5,500 employees by the end of 2011 were on track.
And he pointed to the potential for new drugs and pending decisions by the Food and Drug Administration that might expand the markets for existing Lilly drugs.
''We'll see our way through the storm,'' he said. ''At a time when others say Lilly has to do a deal or Lilly has to go outside itself to solve its problems, we're resolutely focused on what we have to do inside the company to make the innovative medicines that are at the core of value creation for Lilly and patients. That's what we do.''
Long a powerhouse for psychiatric drugs like Prozac, Zyprexa and Cymbalta, Lilly is looking to new drug opportunities in treating cancer and Alzheimer's, two diseases that Mr. Lechleiter said will become more pressing as Americans live longer.
Some analysts do not share his optimism, and point to a lack of promising products in the company's short-term outlook. For example, Lilly has introduced only one product in the last five years, the blood thinner Effient, to sluggish early sales. It has virtually no new products to market until 2013, when it hopes to start rolling out two a year.
The patent losses are daunting: Its schizophrenia drug Zyprexa, whose $4.92 billion in sales last year represented 23 percent of the company's total, goes off patent a year from now. Cymbalta, with $3.07 billion in sales, loses patent protection in 2013. In addition, Lilly lost legal challenges this year to Gemzar, a cancer drug that sold $1.36 billion, and Strattera, a treatment for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder that sold $609 million.
J. P. Morgan last week predicted Lilly would face ''a prolonged period of depressed earnings'' with sales dipping to $18.6 billion in 2015 from a peak of $23 billion in 2010.
C . Anthony Butler of Barclays Capital called for Lilly to make some drastic changes, predicting that its revenue could drop to $18.8 billion in 2015. ''I'm not sure what would drive the going-back-up part,'' he said in an interview.
He also cited the company's longtime relationship to Indianapolis as an impediment to taking measures like slashing costs to preserve its margins and dividends. ''I worry that they can't do that because they're too ingrained in the fabric of the community,'' Mr. Butler said.
Indeed, since its founding here in 1876, Lilly has become the city's largest private employer. Mayor Greg Ballard's father worked there for 33 years; the former mayor, Bart Peterson, works there now; and Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels spent eight years on the Lilly campus.
Indianapolis, a city of about 800,000, is undergoing a tax-supported, $3.3 billion downtown building boom as it gears up to host the 2012 Super Bowl. On Monday, the city, company and a developer announced plans to develop one corner of a sprawling Lilly parking lot into a $150 million hotel, apartment, retail and restaurant complex.
''A recruiting magnet,'' Dr. Lechleiter said as he walked through the lot, pulling a small wheeled suitcase filled with paperwork, on the way to work.
He walks, he said, for exercise and time to reflect. Dr. Lechleiter said he has accepted a ride only once, in a snowstorm, in the four years since he and his wife moved closer to work, living in a penthouse in a downtown luxury hotel.
As he passed through the lobby and hallways, he greeted a dozen employees by their first names before settling in his small corner office.
With a salary of $15.9 million, he has asked the board to freeze his pay ''in light of the business challenges the company currently faces,'' according to Lilly's annual report. Derica W. Rice, the company's chief financial officer, said Lilly has cut 2,100 jobs in the last year.
On the research front, Lilly is bucking a trend among a few competitors, which have decided to shift significant resources away from in-house development.
Just last week, Dr. Andrew Baum, a Morgan Stanley analyst, suggested at a forum in New York the industry giants would be better off abandoning research and buying others'. Licensing, he calculated, would yield three times the returns with less risk.
Mr. Baum said he expected the large European pharmaceutical companies to cut their research spending by about 40 percent in the next two years after a decade of dismal returns.
Lilly does not intend to take that path. Jan M. Lundberg, hired from AstraZeneca in January to lead Lilly Research Laboratories, said, ''We don't change our research based on quarterly earnings. It's a long-term theme.''
Mr. Butler said Lilly has the industry's highest ratio of research to revenue -- 19.8 percent of $21.8 billion sales last year, or $4.3 billion, compared with 15.6 percent at Pfizer, which reported $7.8 billion research spending and $50 billion revenue. Biotechnology products account for about 40 percent of the 70 molecules in Lilly's pipeline.
In a medium-size deal, its biggest purchase ever, Lilly bought ImClone Systems for $6.5 billion in 2008. On Tuesday, in New York, Lilly announced that about 140 cancer researchers from ImClone were starting to work in a new life sciences complex near Bellevue Hospital and NYU Langone Medical Center.
But its best prospects in the next few years are modifications of existing product lines. Its most promising new product is Bydureon, a long-acting form of the diabetes drug Byetta, according to Seamus Fernandez of the health care investment bank Leerink Swann. Bydureon, developed with Amylin Pharmaceuticals and Alkermes, is injected once a week instead of twice a day. Mr. Butler said sales estimates range from $1 billion to $6 billion. The F.D.A. target decision date is Oct. 22.
Lilly also hopes to expand Cymbalta, approved to treat major depression, anxiety and fibromyalgia, into chronic pain. That is under review by the F.D.A.
''We're hopefully at the final stages of negotiating that new indication for Cymbalta in the area of chronic pain,'' Dr. Lechleiter said. And Lilly plans to apply next quarter for approval of the impotence drug Cialis to treat enlarged prostate, he added.
Lilly has been through this doubt and uncertainty before. A decade ago, it lost the patent on Prozac two years earlier than expected. Within four years, it had nine new drugs on the market.
''We're trying to be realistic,'' Dr. Lechleiter said, ''while maintaining a sense of optimism.''

HEADLINE: A.I.G. and U.S. Agree on Exit Plan, but Numbers Are Uncertain

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
As the government wraps up its Troubled Asset Relief Program, the company that received the most from the fund, the American International Group, is offering an exit plan with no clear sense of whether the taxpayers will end up with a gain or a loss.
A.I.G.'s exit agreement, announced Thursday, includes a number of steps that must be taken by early 2011, when the Federal Reserve Bank of New York will officially sever its ties to the company and the Treasury Department will expand its stake to 92.1 percent, then convert all of its preferred shares to common. 
For many months if not years afterward, the Treasury will retain an A.I.G. exposure as it slowly sells off its stake on the public markets. A rapid sell-off would spoil the taxpayers' recovery by driving down the share price.
The exit plan does leave open the possibility that the taxpayers will ultimately be made whole for the assistance they extended to A.I.G., by far the most offered to any nongovernmental company during the financial crisis of 2008. But taxpayers could end up in the red if A.I.G.'s stock price falls before the Treasury can finish selling its shares. Market-moving events, like big jury awards or hurricane losses, are at the heart of the insurance business.
Treasury officials said that as long as A.I.G.'s stock remains above $28.75, they will consider the taxpayers to be in the black on the company's bailout. The stock closed Thursday at $39.10.
James Millstein, chief restructuring officer at the Treasury, said the agency arrived at that number by dividing the total number of shares it would have under the exit plan, about 1.6 billion, by the amount of Treasury dollars that A.I.G. used during its emergency, $47.5 billion.
The company and its government rescuers have been working intently in recent weeks to complete an exit plan before the Treasury's relief program expires this weekend. Much remains to be done before the plan can be executed, probably in early February.
For instance, A.I.G. must still complete the sale of one of its big overseas life insurance businesses to MetLife. The sale was announced in March but needs regulatory approvals and is expected to close in November. It is expected to yield $6.8 billion in cash and $8.7 billion in MetLife stock, which will be used to pay down some of the company's remaining $20 billion debt to the Fed.
Still more money for the Fed will come from an initial public stock offering of another big foreign life insurance business on the Hong Kong exchange. The offering, planned more than a year ago, was delayed for several months while A.I.G. tried unsuccessfully to sell the unit to a British company. The company now says the Hong Kong offering will go forward this year.
The Treasury will also help A.I.G. redeem most of the Fed's unusual $26 billion preferred stake in the company. A.I.G. will use $22 billion remaining in a $30 billion emergency package that the Treasury made available in early 2009.
In exchange, the Treasury will get the Fed's preferred stake, bringing its ownership of A.I.G. to 92.1 percent.
The company said it would come up with the additional $4 billion for the Fed with ''proceeds from future asset monetizations,'' including sales of two smaller Japanese insurance units that were also announced Thursday morning.
Once the Fed has been fully repaid, the Treasury will convert its preferred shares to common stock, diluting existing shareholders yet again. To cushion that blow, the company said it would issue up to 75 million warrants for those nongovernment shareholders, allowing them to buy more common stock for $45 a share in the future.
Treasury officials said they hoped these terms would end the current uncertainty over whether investors in A.I.G. might once again by diluted by the federal government, and how severely. That, they said, could stabilize the company's stock and attract the institutional investors that have stayed away from A.I.G. during its restructuring.
To demonstrate that A.I.G. was ready to stand on its own, they said it would issue relatively small amounts of debt and equity in the next few months. The purpose would be to show auditors and rating agencies that A.I.G. could once again tap the capital markets if it needed to, which it has been unable to do since its crisis began. The company will also require a revolving credit facility from a private lender.
But officials said the many short-term liabilities that crowded A.I.G.'s balance sheet two years ago -- and contributed to its cascading disaster -- had all been refinanced over the past two years, and would not return.
The A.I.G. chief executive, Robert H. Benmosche, said in a statement that the plan would let A.I.G. ''remain on track to emerge with one of the largest, most diversified property and casualty companies in the world.''

HEADLINE: Second-Quarter Growth Is Revised Higher, to 1.7%

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- The latest revision on second-quarter growth, at a pace of 1.7 percent, was slightly higher than the estimate a month ago. 
The Commerce Department said on Thursday that the economy grew at an annual rate of 1.7 percent in the quarter, revised from 1.6 percent.
Still, that is a sharp slowdown from a 3.7 percent rate in the first quarter and does not change the big picture: the economy has been losing momentum since the end of last year.
Many economists say they think the economy grew at around the same anemic pace, or slightly worse, during the July-to-September quarter. Little improvement is expected in the final quarter of 2010, which is why unemployment -- now at 9.6 percent -- is expected to stay high, or even rise, in the coming months.
Americans are not spending at a robust enough pace to bulk up companies' sales and make them confident enough to increase hiring. Consumers and businesses, battered by the worst recession since the 1930s, are clinging to their cautious ways.
Consumers, in particular, are paring down debt, are not spending as much as they normally do during an economic recovery and are saving more. Their spending accounts for roughly 70 percent of economic activity, so their frugal behavior explains why the economy is stuck in a slow-growth rut.
In the second quarter, Americans saved 5.9 percent of their disposable income, the most in a year. Before the recession, they saved 2.1 percent.
The sharp dropoff in gross domestic product in the second quarter mainly reflected fallout from a bigger trade deficit. A surge in imported goods swamped growth in exports to other countries. The bigger trade gap that resulted shaved 3.5 percentage points from second-quarter growth, the most since 1947.
In another report released Thursday, applications for jobless benefits dropped last week for the third time in four weeks, a sign that employers are cutting fewer jobs.
Initial claims for unemployment aid fell by 16,000 to a seasonally adjusted 453,000, the Labor Department said. Wall Street analysts had expected a smaller drop.
The decline means jobless claims have returned to the same level they were two weeks ago. Initial claims have fluctuated around 450,000 for most of this year.
The four-week average of claims, a less volatile measure, dropped for the fifth consecutive week, to 458,000, the lowest level in two months.
Applications for unemployment benefits, while volatile, provide a real-time snapshot of the job market. The weekly claims figures are considered a measure of the pace of layoffs and an indication of companies' willingness to hire.
Initial claims have fallen sharply since June 2009, the month the recession ended. They topped 600,000 at the end of that month. But most of that decline took place last year.
The number of people continuing to receive jobless benefits fell by 83,000 to just below 4.5 million, the department said. But that doesn't include several million people who are receiving unemployment aid under extended programs approved by Congress during the recession.
The extended benefit rolls dropped by about 300,000 to 4.9 million in the week ending Sept. 11, the latest data available. All told, about 8.8 million people received unemployment aid that week.

HEADLINE: A Warhol Soup Can Comes to Market

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
Even when the economy is struggling and buyers are reluctant to spend money, there are always a handful of collectors willing to splurge for a good, early Warhol painting. So when Barney Ebsworth, a Seattle collector, was assessing his holdings, trying to decide what to sell to finance a church designed by the Japanese architect Tadao Ando that he is building, it was Warhol rather than de Kooning or Calder or Pollock that he chose to auction.
''The Warhol will probably make the most money,'' said Mr. Ebsworth, who made his fortune in the cruise ship and travel business. ''Until now I never sold anything, never thought about it.'' 
On Nov. 10 Christie's will be auctioning ''Big Campbell's Soup Can With Can Opener (Vegetable),'' a 1962 painting of the artist's signature image, this one with a can opener in the top corner. Experts at Christie's are estimating it will sell for $30 million to $50 million.
''Warhol did three series of soup cans; the last of these, which this painting comes from, is often called the Still Life Series,'' said Laura Paulson, a deputy chairwoman at Christie's. ''Some were pierced with a can opener, others flayed, their labels torn or crushed.''
Since it left the Factory, this work has been in only three collections. The year it was painted, the New York collectors Burton and Emily Tremaine bought it directly from Warhol. And that summer it was included in an exhibition at the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art in Hartford, which became the first American museum to show a Warhol painting. In the late 1970s the couple sold it to Ted Ashley, then the chairman of Warner Brothers, and his wife, Page. In 1986, Christie's held a sale of the Ashley collection in New York, where it was bought by James Mayer, a London dealer, for $264,000. Mr. Mayer sold it to Mr. Ebsworth shortly after that.
It may come down to soup versus soda. This fall's sales feature another Warhol from 1962. ''Coca-Cola [4] [Large Coca-Cola],'' a classic image of the soda bottle, is being auctioned at Sotheby's on behalf of the collector Elizabeth Rea the night before the soup can comes on the block. The bottle is estimated at $20 million to $25 million.
GOSSART DISCOVERIES
In the process of researching ''Man, Myth and Sensual Pleasures: Jan Gossart's Renaissance,'' which opens on Wednesday at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Maryan Ainsworth, the Met curator who organized the exhibition, spent years traveling to obscure museums, examining every painting associated with the artist, even those that weren't necessarily attributed to him.
Her investigation led to many works that scholars had thought were painted by members of Gossart's workshop rather than the master himself. And because they were considered unimportant, they had been relegated to warehouses and museum basements decades ago. Two such paintings attributed to his followers -- ''Portrait of a Man'' in the Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten in Antwerp and ''Christ on the Cold Stone'' from the Szepmuveszeti Muzeum in Budapest -- have turned out to be the real deal.
Even though the works were covered in dirt, their varnish severely discolored, Ms. Ainsworth said she had studied so many paintings by Gossart that she had a hunch these were his as well. ''Even through the muck you could see the handling and execution of the figures,'' she said. One indication, Ms. Ainsworth added, was that ''Gossart was able to render figures so they were sculptural because he considered them fully in the round.''
Since neither the Antwerp nor the Budapest museum was able to clean its painting in time for the exhibition, she brought the works to the conservation laboratory at the Met, where conservators removed decades of dirt and varnish and then studied the paintings using infrared reflectography, X-rays and pigment analysis.
In the case of ''Portrait of a Man,'' it was determined that the coat of arms of Franck van Borselan, Count of Ostrevant, a nobleman who died some seven years before the artist was born, clearly seen in the panel's right side, was in fact a later addition, painted years after the rest of the portrait. ''In discussions with the conservators in Antwerp,'' Ms. Ainsworth said, ''it was decided to paint over the coat of arms so that it is no longer visible, thus visually eliminating a false addition to the painting.''
Now the show, which is on view through Jan. 17, will include 50 of the 63 known paintings by Gossart, whom scholars believe was an important pivotal figure between van Eyck and Rubens.
REPRESENTING JUDD
The foundation started by the Minimalist sculptor Donald Judd is now being represented by David Zwirner, the Chelsea dealer. Mr. Zwirner, who announced the latest addition to his stable this week, said he was organizing a Judd exhibition at his gallery in May. ''I am also planning to strategically place works in public collections,'' he said.
Since Judd's death in 1994, the foundation has owned and maintained his home and studio at 101 Spring Street in SoHo, which is being restored -- a project that is expected to be completed in 2013 and will allow the public to see permanently installed work by Judd and his contemporaries. The foundation also oversees the 15-building campus where he lived and worked in Marfa, Tex.
This won't be the first time the foundation has parted with some of its holdings. In May 2006 Christie's sold 26 Judd works on behalf of the foundation for a total of $24.4 million to create an endowment to support its permanent installations in New York and Texas.
NEW JOB AT NEW MUSEUM
Massimiliano Gioni, who has been director of special exhibitions at the New Museum for the last four years, has been named its associate director and director of exhibitions.
Lisa Phillips, director of the New Museum, said she created the new job to spearhead the more ambitious programs at the institution. ''Massimiliano has both a local and a global perspective,'' she said. ''Both are becoming increasingly important as the museum evolves.''

HEADLINE: Making Math as Easy as 1, Pause, 2, Pause ...

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU

 BODY:
FRANKLIN LAKES, N.J. -- By the time they get to kindergarten, children in this well-to-do suburb already know their numbers, so their teachers worried that a new math program was too easy when it covered just 1 and 2 -- for a whole week.
''Talk about the number 1 for 45 minutes?'' said Chris Covello, who teaches 16 students ages 5 and 6. ''I was like, I don't know. But then I found you really could. Before, we had a lot of ground to cover, and now it's more open-ended and gets kids thinking.''
The slower pace is a cornerstone of the district's new approach to teaching math, which is based on the national math system of Singapore and aims to emulate that country's success by promoting a deeper understanding of numbers and math concepts. Students in Singapore have repeatedly ranked at or near the top on international math exams since the mid-1990s. 
Franklin Lakes, about 30 miles northwest of Manhattan, is one of dozens of districts, from Scarsdale, N.Y., to Lexington, Ky., that in recent years have adopted Singapore math, as it is called, amid growing concerns that too many American students lack the higher-order math skills called for in a global economy.
For decades, efforts to improve math skills have driven schools to embrace one math program after another, abandoning a program when it does not work and moving on to something purportedly better. In the 1960s there was the ''new math,'' whose focus on abstract theories spurred a back-to-basics movement, emphasizing rote learning and drills. After that came ''reform math,'' whose focus on problem solving and conceptual understanding has been derided by critics as the ''new new math.''
Singapore math may well be a fad, too, but supporters say it seems to address one of the difficulties in teaching math: all children learn differently. In contrast to the most common math programs in the United States, Singapore math devotes more time to fewer topics, to ensure that children master the material through detailed instruction, questions, problem solving, and visual and hands-on aids like blocks, cards and bar charts. Ideally, they do not move on until they have thoroughly learned a topic.
Principals and teachers say that slowing down the learning process gives students a solid math foundation upon which to build increasingly complex skills, and makes it less likely that they will forget and have to be retaught the same thing in later years.
And with Singapore math, the pace can accelerate by fourth and fifth grades, putting children as much as a year ahead of students in other math programs as they grasp complex problems more quickly.
''Our old program, Everyday Math, did not do that,'' said Danielle Santoro, assistant principal of Public School 132 in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, which introduced Singapore math last year for all 700 students in kindergarten through fifth grade. ''One day it could be money, the next day it could be time, and you would not get back to those concepts until a week later.''
Singapore math's added appeal is that it has largely skirted the math wars of recent decades over whether to teach traditional math or reform math. Indeed, Singapore math has often been described by educators and parents as a more balanced approach between the two, melding old-fashioned algorithms with visual representations and critical thinking.
In Franklin Lakes, teachers are learning the new math system as they pass the knowledge on to their students. One morning last week, Ms. Covello and six other kindergarten teachers worked with a consultant on how to reinforce the number 8 for students. First came a catchy tune about eight oranges; then they counted off one by one while throwing up their arms in a wave.
Singapore math was developed by the country's Ministry of Education nearly 30 years ago, and the textbooks have been imported for more than a decade. The earliest adopters in the United States were home-school parents and a small number of schools that had heard about it through word of mouth.
Today it can be found in neighborhood schools like P.S. 132, which serves mostly poor students, as well as elite schools, including Hunter College Elementary School, a public school for gifted children in Manhattan, and the Sidwell Friends School in Washington, a private school attended by President Obama's daughters.
SingaporeMath.com, a company that has distributed the ''Primary Mathematics'' books in the United States since 1998, reports that it now has sales to more than 1,500 schools, about twice as many as in 2008. And Houghton Mifflin Harcourt's Math in Focus, the United States edition of a popular Singapore math series, is now used in 120 school districts and 60 charter schools and private schools, the publisher says.
Some recent research suggests that students who are taught Singapore math score higher on standardized math tests, and in anecdotal reports, teachers say it helps even young children to develop confidence in their math abilities. But school officials caution that Singapore math is not easy or cheap to successfully adopt.
In some districts, there has also been skepticism from school board members and parents about importing a foreign math program. The books look different from standard-issue textbooks, with fewer pages and brightly colored pictures and diagrams, and early versions contained references to curry puffs and the Asian fruit rambutan.
The books and materials initially cost an average of $40 to $52 per student, comparable to other math programs in the United States. As with other math programs, workbooks might be replaced from year to year. But training teachers can be expensive.
''All along, people have said it's too hard, too demanding for teachers,'' said Jeffery Thomas, a history teacher who founded SingaporeMath.comwith his wife, Dawn, after using the books to tutor their daughter at home in the suburbs of Portland, Ore.
Mr. Thomas said that about a dozen schools had started and dropped Singapore math, in some cases because teachers themselves lacked a strong math background and adequate training in the program.
When the Scarsdale district switched to Singapore math at its elementary schools in 2008, it expanded the number of math coaches to three from one to help the 110 classroom teachers learn the material. The district spent $121,000 on the ''Primary Mathematics'' books and $24,632 for teachers' materials.
Bill Jackson, one of Scarsdale's new math coaches, scribbled notes the other day as he watched a fourth-grade math class. For nearly an hour, the students pored over a single number: 82,566 (the seats in New Meadowlands Stadium, where the Giants and Jets play football). They built it with chips on a laminated mat, diagramed it on a smart board and, finally, solved written questions.
Mr. Jackson said that students moved through a three-step learning process: concrete, pictorial, abstract. American math programs, he said, typically skip the middle step and lose students when making the jump from concrete (chips) to abstract (questions).
Mr. Jackson began experimenting with Singapore math while teaching at School 2 in Paterson, N.J., in 2000. Test scores were mixed, and the school replaced it four years later. But Mr. Jackson continued to use it when he could. ''I learned more math from Singapore math than I ever did in high school or college,'' he said.
Here in Franklin Lakes, students in a second-grade class at High Mountain Road School rolled dice last week to build two- and three-digit numbers. Then they lined up together, each holding a different number, and shuffled back and forth to order their numbers from largest to smallest, then smallest to largest.
One student in the class, Lindsey Polevoy, said she liked math better this year. ''I don't like being rushed,'' she said. ''Sometimes I get really nervous and my fingers sweat and I give the wrong answer.''

HEADLINE: Magazine Association Renames Itself

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
THE trade association for the consumer magazine industry is joining other organizations in media and marketing in rebranding itself to better reflect the realities of competing for consumer eyeballs and advertising dollars in the 21st century.
The Magazine Publishers of America is being renamed MPA -- the Association of Magazine Media (dash and all). The dispatching of ''publishers'' from the name is meant to signal how readers can engage with magazines beyond the printed page through nontraditional means like Web sites, mobile devices, tablets, events, social media, books, retail presences and even branded merchandise.
The change is to be described on Monday at a presentation during a general session of the 2010 American Magazine Conference. A logo redesign, by Pentagram, will also be introduced. 
The conference, which begins in Chicago on Sunday and continues through Tuesday, is co-sponsored by the MPA -- there it is, the new name -- and the American Society of Magazine Editors.
The rebranding will also be expressed through efforts like video clips, called Magazine Media Minutes, featuring disparate publications like Food & Wine, Glamour, Men's Health, Natural Home, People, Popular Mechanics and Runner's World. The videos will be available, starting at noon on Friday, on a channel on YouTube that can be reached through the MPA Web site (magazine.org/mmm).
The name change is at least the second for the association, which was founded in 1919; it was known until 1987 as the Magazine Publishers Association.
(The 1987 renaming took place a week before the Black Monday stock market crash of Oct. 19, so investors who are magazine readers -- and vice versa -- might want to re-examine their portfolios in coming days.)
The coincidence does serve to remind that the rebranding is coming as magazine publishers are confronting challenges caused by the economic cycle as well as technology. Magazine circulations and ad pages have been significantly affected by the recession as well as the rise of digital media.
According to PricewaterhouseCoopers, magazine ad spending, which reached $14.4 billion in 2007, fell to $13.3 billion in 2008 and $10.5 billion last year. The declines are expected to continue, PricewaterhouseCoopers estimated, to $9.8 billion this year and $9.5 billion in 2011. That cumulative decline from 2007 to 2011 would be 34 percent.
The year 2007 was ''a tremendous year for magazines and a banner year for most magazine companies,'' said Jack Griffin, who recently became chief executive at the Time Inc. unit of Time Warner, publisher of magazines like Fortune and Time, after serving as president for the national media group of the Meredith Corporation, publisher of magazines like Better Homes and Gardens and Family Circle.
From mid-2008 through late 2009, publishers were ''just trying to manage a crisis, and we all suffered in that period,'' said Mr. Griffin, who is to become chairman of the MPA at the conference. Now, it is time to ''define the future,'' he added, and take a position that ''in a sea of commoditized content, magazine media have enormous value.''
Kantar Media, a unit of WPP that tracks ad spending, has reported better results for magazine media so far this year, with ad revenue up 5.7 percent in the second quarter and 1.6 percent in the first half compared with the same periods a year ago. (Kantar data include business-to-business magazines, which do not belong to MPA.)
The rebranding is intended as part of ''a new mission statement, a new set of priorities'' for the association, said Nina B. Link, president and chief executive of the MPA.
''It's an acknowledgment of things we've been doing aggressively in the digital space,'' she added, ''and really a look to the future.''
At the same time, ''we're not abandoning print,'' Ms. Link said, but rather ''expanding as consumers want to receive content across multiple platforms.''
The word ''magazine'' remains, she added, ''because there is something unique about magazines -- the immersive experience, the curated content and the sense of a community of interests.''
The association reorganized its executive ranks in August, bringing in new blood like Andrew Jung, a former Kellogg executive, who became executive vice president and chief marketing officer, and Christopher Kevorkian, who filled a new post, executive vice president for digital.
The MPA plans to continue its participation in a campaign that began in March and carries the theme ''Magazines, the power of print.'' The campaign, created by Y&R New York -- part of the Young & Rubicam Brands unit of WPP -- also involves major MPA members like Conde Nast Publications, Hearst Magazines, and Wenner Media.
The campaign has drawn mixed notices. In a review on Tuesday on Slate.com, Jack Shafer lumped it with a similar campaign for the Newspaper Association of America and said they both ''make me think of the old guy in the office who can't stop telling his younger co-workers -- and his younger boss -- that he's still a player and that he could prove it if only they'd just give him a chance. One more chance.''
Mr. Griffin said negative reactions are ''to be expected'' because ''people love to take shots.''
''We're making a declarative series of statements that magazine advertising in print and digital formats is highly engaging and highly effective,'' he added. ''Let people take their shots; I don't really care.''
Among the other associations that have recently changed their names are the American Association of Advertising Agencies, now the Four A's, and the Television Bureau of Advertising, now TVB.
''I can't speak for those other associations,'' Mr. Griffin said, but the trend suggests that ''organizations of all stripes are being affirmative about their relevance in a period of great change and complexity.''

HEADLINE: Cautious Positions May Be Overdone

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER SWANN and RICHARD BEALES

 BODY:
The annual investment updates from America's great university endowments add to evidence that investors have fallen out of love with public equities. After a decade of zero returns, this is understandable. But with stocks cheap and bonds stretched, investors may rue this underweight position.
David Swensen, chief investment officer at Yale, already famous for his wariness of listed equities, is not the only one who has been trimming stocks. Harvard has scaled back its allocation. It's down to 33 percent this year, from 46 percent in 2000. And the universities are in good company. Morgan Stanley reports a migration out of equities over the last decade by insurers, pensions and mutual funds. 
This shift looks overdone. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is now trading at just 16 times trailing operating earnings, or about 15 percent below its average over the last two decades, according to Standard and Poor's. This looks particularly appealing when companies in the index hold a record $850 billion of cash that could be used for dividends, buybacks or acquisitions. Analysts also believe earnings next year will finally surpass the 2006 peak.
Emerging market shares -- the only portion of its equity holdings where Harvard's endowment, run by Jane Mendillo, has been increasing its holdings -- look to be a better value still. Earnings estimates have been revised up much faster than for developed peers, yet at 12.6 times 2010 forecast earnings, the MSCI emerging index is trading at a hefty discount.
Equally revealing, bonds look especially frothy. Fixed income markets have seen greater inflows than equities did during the tech bubble of 2000, according to Morgan Stanley. With 10-year Treasury notes yielding just 2.5 percent, further buying only makes sense for those expecting deep deflation -- a menace that policy makers have so far been able to hold at bay. Indeed, investors can get an almost identical dividend yield from holding stocks like Microsoft. This is a classic sign that shares are cheap.
Stocks may have been a disappointment over the last decade. But barring a bout of deflation, there are good reasons to expect they will regain some of their luster in coming years. Even the Ivy League gets it wrong from time to time.
In A.I.G.'s View
The American International Group is throwing off its shackles. But taxpayers will be locked in for a while yet. The company's deal with the government over its $100 billion of bailout funds makes the insurer's finances simpler and healthier.
That's potentially good for shareholders. But initially, the plan largely just rearranges the government's interests. It is hard to see how it gets taxpayers cash back any sooner, while increasing their risk.
Robert Benmosche, the A.I.G. chief, understandably likes the deal. It will remove the New York Federal Reserve as a senior secured creditor and swap the $49 billion scarlet letter of government bailout preferred shares for common stock. That should allow him to normalize a borrowing relationship with lenders right away and give him more flexibility. As for dealing with the government, the Treasury will take on the remaining New York Fed interests, leaving only one master for A.I.G. to deal with.
Mr. Benmosche is right that the stigma of being one of the remaining recipients of Troubled Asset Relief Program aid as the program winds down wouldn't be good for credibility. But A.I.G.'s cheerful notion that the plan ''provides for full repayment'' of taxpayers is premature.
Some $20 billion of New York Fed loans will be repaid, but the remaining Treasury interest will be ratcheted down the capital structure. Whether its 92.1 percent stake in A.I.G. ends up being worth enough to repay taxpayers is up to financial markets.
To be fair, the Treasury would be in the money based on today's stock price. And Mr. Benmosche, having improved A.I.G.'s performance, wants to increase its value further. Meanwhile, the government is making money on its sale of Citigroup shares, a precedent that hasn't gone unnoticed. But selling a less than 30 percent stake in the bank, initially worth some $25 billion, is taking the government longer than originally anticipated. Mr. Benmosche's suggestion that offloading a far larger stake in A.I.G. may take 18 months sounds optimistic.
Normalizing A.I.G.'s financial situation is a step forward. And the government could make money on its equity stake. However, as investment advisers warn, stock prices can go down as well as up. Mr. Benmosche and his colleagues can breathe easier as soon as the plan gets locked in; taxpayers will have to wait. CHRISTOPHER SWANN and RICHARD BEALES

HEADLINE: Document Flaws Lead to Turmoil On Foreclosures

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD

 BODY:
The foreclosure machinery that has forced millions of Americans out of their homes is beginning to seize up as some lenders and their lawyers are accused of cutting corners in their pursuit of rapid home repossessions.
Evictions are expected to slow sharply, housing analysts said, as state and national law enforcement officials shine a light on questionable foreclosure methods revealed by two of the country's biggest home lenders in the last two weeks.
Even lenders with no known problems are expected to approach defaulting homeowners more cautiously and look more aggressively for resolutions short of outright eviction. 
Despite the turmoil, some economists said the breakdown could ultimately lay the groundwork for a real estate recovery.
Stricken neighborhoods across the country, for example, could benefit. One big factor undermining home sales is fear of a large number of foreclosed homes coming to the market. If the foreclosures are delayed or never happen, housing prices might find a floor.
''Maybe this is like shock therapy,'' said the economist Karl E. Case. ''Maybe this will actually get the lenders to the table and encourage them to work out deals that are to the benefit of everybody.''
While such a happy ending is possible, the near term is more likely to produce paralysis and confusion.
As more defaulting homeowners become aware of the lenders' problems, they are expected to hire lawyers and challenge the proceedings against them. And if completed foreclosures were not properly done, families who bought the troubled homes could be vulnerable to claims by the former owners.
Apparently alarmed about such a possibility, one of the major title insurance companies, Old Republic National Title, has sent a bulletin to agents saying that ''until further notice'' it would not insure title to properties foreclosed upon by GMAC Mortgage, the country's fourth-largest home lender and one of the two big lenders at the center of the current controversy.
GMAC declined to comment, and Old Republic representatives did not return calls.
GMAC has acknowledged legal missteps in processing mortgages, and JPMorgan Chase has acknowledged the possibility of missteps, and both have suspended all foreclosures in the 23 states where they need a court's approval. That's 56,000 in the case of Chase alone; GMAC declined to provide a number.
Attorneys general in half a dozen states are demanding action or opening investigations. The Treasury Department said Thursday it was asking regulators to look into ''these troubling developments.''
''We're seeing a fundamental breakdown in the system, because no one cared that much about getting things right,'' said Representative Alan Grayson, a Democrat of Florida, who unsuccessfully asked the Florida Supreme Court to halt all foreclosures in that state.
Wall Street was examining the impact the disclosures could have on the lenders. Moody's Investors Service has placed the servicer ratings of GMAC and Chase on review for possible downgrade.
The federal government has been the majority owner of GMAC since supplying $17 billion to prevent the lender's failure during the financial crisis.
Other lenders said Thursday that their foreclosure filings, including the crucial affidavits, had been properly done.
A Citigroup spokesman said the lender required ''annual training for our foreclosure employees on the proper execution of affidavits, including having personal knowledge of the information in the affidavit.''
A Wells Fargo spokeswoman said ''the affidavits we sign are accurate.'' A spokesman for Bank of America, Rick Simon, said, ''We do not have anything to tell you at this time.''
GMAC and Chase are in trouble because, overwhelmed with foreclosures, they tried to process them as quickly and cheaply as possible, defense lawyers say. The companies say they are reviewing their procedures to take care of any violations.
The missteps stemmed from the affidavits the lenders file as they seek a quick or summary judgment in thousands of foreclosure cases. The affidavits state certain facts about the case, including the amount owed, which the signer indicates he has personal knowledge of. Without the affidavit, the lender would have to prove the facts at trial.
In depositions taken by lawyers for homeowners, executives at GMAC and Chase said they or their teams signed 10,000 or more affidavits and related documents a month. That did not give them time to review the cases.
Defense lawyers say the disclosures are symptomatic of the carelessness, if not outright fraud, that lenders have been exhibiting for years in their rush to file cases. Many necessary documents have disappeared, with defense lawyers saying the lenders often do not even have standing to foreclose.
In a number of pending cases in Florida, defense lawyers there said, GMAC has already withdrawn affidavits. The lawyers said they would try to have the cases thrown out for possible fraud, although they acknowledged that might be difficult.
GMAC said it would refile the affidavits. Chase said it had not withdrawn any affidavits.
''The way the plaintiffs' lawyers have handled this has corrupted our legal system,'' said Thomas Cox, a Maine lawyer whose deposition of a GMAC executive in June helped prompt the current disclosures. ''They tried to manufacture foreclosures the way you'd manufacture cars, on an assembly line. It can't be done that way.''
Mr. Cox is representing pro bono a rural woman who is in foreclosure on a $82,000 mortgage. The plaintiff in the case is Fannie Mae, the mortgage holding company that failed during the financial crisis and is now under government conservatorship. GMAC serviced the loan for Fannie Mae.
This week, the judge in the case set aside his summary judgment in favor of Fannie when he read Mr. Cox's deposition of a GMAC executive, Jeffrey Stephan, who said he never reviewed the file he had signed. The case will now go to trial.
''I don't think they are going to give up easily,'' said Mr. Cox.
As the foreclosure crisis has deepened, the length of time borrowers spend waiting for the end has lengthened.
In January 2009 the time between the owner's first missed payment and eviction was 319 days, according to LPS Applied Analytics. By August it was 478 days.
Since spring, the data firm says, the lenders have been trying to clear their backlog. They have stepped up the rate at which they put defaulting owners into the formal foreclosure process. In August, they started 283,000 foreclosures, up from 220,000 in April.
Now, as the lenders are pressed to examine more closely their filings, those foreclosure starts are likely to fall, prolonging the owner's time in limbo. Many borrowers use this period, when they are living in their home but not paying for it, to try and get their financial house back in order.

HEADLINE: U.N. Says Global Employment Needs 5 Years to Rebound

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR

 BODY:
UNITED NATIONS -- It will take five more years before employment around the world rebounds to the point it was before the financial crisis, two years longer than previously predicted, the International Labor Organization said in its annual jobs report on Thursday.
To get back to the level of employment in 2007, the global economy needs to create nearly 23 million jobs, including more than 14 million in developed countries, the report said. 
''The root causes of the crisis have not been properly tackled,'' said Raymond Torres, an economist and the lead author of the report.
Now that the effects of public stimulus packages around the globe are fading, fiscal policies are not sufficiently focused on job growth, which helps explain the likely delay in improving employment, the report said.
Without such changes, there will probably be an increase in social unrest, especially in countries where unemployment remains high. About 25 countries have already experienced strife linked to the economic crisis, according to the report.
''We don't need the poll data to see more social unrest,'' Mr. Torres said. ''You can see the strikes here in Europe, while in China and other Asian countries you can see social discontent.''
Some countries have encouraging signs of jobs recovery, particularly in Asia and Latin America, but in the United States the duration of unemployment has lengthened. One reason the American unemployment rate dropped to 9.6 percent in August from 10.1 percent in the previous October is that 1.2 million people unable to find jobs stopped looking for work, the report said, so they are no longer counted.
To increase employment, governments need to focus on measures like training, raise the spending power of those with jobs in emerging economies through wage increases and enact far-reaching financial reform, according to the labor organization, a United Nations agency.
Economists generally endorsed the findings of the report, but they noted that if any of the recommendations were simple to achieve, they would have been put in place long ago.
Training for new skills does not automatically translate into new jobs, as seen in the fact that vocational training schools and community colleges in the United States are booming, argued Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group, an advisory organization.
The fundamental problem, Mr. Baumohl said, ''is that job creation during the recovery is going to be a lot slower than in previous cycles.'' Austerity measures in Europe, for example, will mean that public and private payroll cuts there will be deep and long.
Raising wages in countries like Brazil and India to help stimulate demand can cut both ways, economists noted, because it can also discourage employers from adding workers.
In terms of wider financial reform, Mr. Torres argued that re-establishing the walls separating commercial banks and investment banks would help revitalize manufacturing and other businesses that create jobs because commercial banks tend to focus on such industries.
Some economists thought that solution might border on the simplistic, though they said unfreezing the credit market for established businesses was essential for the health of the recovery.
The labor organization acknowledged that conditions varied from country to country, but it tried to boil down trends according to economic categories. In the 35 most advanced economies, job growth will remain stagnant for the rest of this year. Low- to middle-income countries, by contrast, were the least affected by the crisis, and the jobs they did lose have been largely replaced.
But restoring jobs to pre-crisis levels is not sufficient to keep up with demand, Mr. Torres said. Forty-five million jobs need to be created annually around the world to keep pace with new workers entering the market, he said, the bulk of them in the developing world.

HEADLINE: A Candidate Tugs Unabashedly on the Heartstrings

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE

 BODY:
MIAMI -- Marco Rubio's latest television ad features soaring music and tributes in Spanish to what he describes in speeches as the ''go-getter'' ethos that defines his family and the United States.
''My parents came to this country and worked very hard and sacrificed a lot so that I could live the American dream,'' he says in the ad now appearing across Florida. ''Unfortunately that dream is threatened by the actions of some politicians in Washington.'' 
The message and tone are similar to the first ad Mr. Rubio released in his campaign for the United States Senate. Together they highlight an element of the Rubio appeal in this election campaign: his emphasis on striving, and on the past.
Mr. Rubio may have risen to prominence with a pledge of fiscal responsibility, which helped secure his conservative base, but in a state where unemployment shows no sign of dropping, and the real estate market remains grim, he now seems to be surging in part because his campaign tugs the heartstrings.
Two new polls released this week showed him with a widening double-digit lead over Gov. Charlie Crist, who is now running as an independent, and over Kendrick B. Meek, the Democrat. A Quinnipiac poll released Thursday found that Mr. Rubio was benefiting from ''strong voter anger at the federal government.''
But by repeatedly telling crowds that he wants to preserve what has made the United States exceptional, he has come to resemble an emotional alchemist: he soaks up voters' anger and returns it to them as nostalgia and longing.
It is not uncommon for older voters in particular to be brought to tears by his stories of growing up as the son of hardworking Cuban immigrants. Jeb Bush, Florida's former Republican governor and one of the state's most beloved leaders, even described Rubio's disposition as ''Reaganesque.'' In an interview with MSNBC on Thursday, Mr. Bush said Mr. Rubio was offering what ''the Republican Party needs to have, which is a hopeful, optimistic message based on our principles.''
It is a style, incidentally, that bears the marks of a more recent upstart.
''It's much like Obama,'' said Ron Book, a Republican lobbyist and strategist. Their messages are very different, he added, but both men are young (Mr. Rubio is 39), strong speakers with biographies that highlight hard work and success.
''At the end of the day,'' Mr. Book said, ''the public is looking for young leaders who they can look to, who inspire them, who they think can solve the ills we're facing today.''
Mr. Rubio's opponents -- who have been in the trenches, battling for Democrats and independents with more negative ads -- describe his approach as a milquetoast throwback.
''Marco Rubio does not have a patent or exclusivity rights on the American Dream!'' said Adam Sharon, a spokesman for Mr. Meek, in an e-mail. ''Also, Kendrick is focused on strengthening the middle class in Florida, whereas Crist and Rubio promote tax breaks for the wealthy.''
In an interview, Mr. Crist said Mr. Rubio's focus on the American dream ''doesn't necessarily match the facts or the positions that he would be taking to Washington.''
He said Mr. Rubio's stance on illegal immigration -- favoring Arizona-style enforcement, and opposing the Dream Act, which would open a path to legal status for many illegal-immigrant students -- suggested that Mr. Rubio's words would not match his actions.
''It's almost a masking of policy with a stylistic approach,'' Mr. Crist said.
Another detail that has surprised Mr. Rubio's critics is the degree to which he has sidestepped criticism of his own financial management. Early accusations that he misused Republican Party credit cards -- spending money on trips and personal grooming during and after his time as speaker of the Florida House -- appears to have done his image only minimal damage.
Many voters do not seem to be bothered, polls suggest, by the contrast between the big salary he has earned as a lawyer over the years ($1.2 million in total from 2004 to 2008) and his personal debts, which deflated his net worth to less than $10,000 at the end of 2008.
Now that Mr. Rubio has a clear lead, these issues may be more likely to come up. The three candidates debate for the second time next Wednesday in Orlando.
But Alex Burgos, a spokesman for the Rubio campaign, said most Florida voters could probably relate to debts tied to houses and education.
Correction: October 6, 2010, Wednesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Friday about the campaign strategy of Marco Rubio, the Republican Senate candidate in Florida, misstated his earnings as a lawyer. He earned $1.2 million from 2004 to 2008; he did not earn $1.2 million in a single year.

HEADLINE: PAKISTANI DEATHS IN U.S. AIRSTRIKE STRAIN RELATIONS

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ and HELENE COOPER; Jane Perlez reported from Islamabad, Pakistan, and Helene Cooper from Washington. Ismail Khan contributed reporting from Peshawar, Pakistan; Eric Schmitt from Washington; and Alissa J. Rubin from Kabul, Afghanistan.

 BODY:
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- American officials pressed their Pakistani counterparts on Thursday to reopen a vital supply route for American and NATO forces in Afghanistan, as relations deteriorated after the fourth strike by coalition helicopters in a week killed three members of Pakistan's border force.
Pakistan angrily closed the crossing to protest the strikes on its side of the border, leaving American officials to use meetings and phone calls to try to soothe relations and get the route reopened. Both sides indicated that they might be able to resolve the dispute with a joint investigation.
But the border closing, and the exceptional series of strikes by piloted aircraft, as opposed to drones, signaled a general increase in tensions between Pakistan and the United States, already uncomfortable allies that are pursuing competing interests in the Afghan war.
The C.I.A. carried out a record number of drone attacks inside Pakistan last month, and new reports surfaced this week of unlawful executions by the Pakistani Army in areas where it has opened operations against Taliban forces threatening the government. 
The Pakistani offensives have not extended to North Waziristan, the prime stronghold of the insurgents who infiltrate Afghanistan, a growing source of frustration for American officials who face a deadline this year to show progress in the Afghan war.
''We are clearly in the phase of our relationship where we're trying to tell them we're being diddled,'' said Teresita C. Schaffer, director of the South Asia program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
But, she added: ''We have been trying for a couple of years to decrease our logistical dependence on Pakistan, and have only managed to get it to 80 percent from 90 percent. So, no, we clearly don't have anyplace else to go.''
The border closing was a clear demonstration of the leverage Pakistan holds over the American war effort. It coincided with a previously scheduled visit by the C.I.A. director, Leon E. Panetta, who met Thursday with the Pakistani military chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, part of a stream of American officials who have come to alternately cajole and coerce Pakistani cooperation.
On Friday, unidentified assailants in Pakistan attacked and set fire to tankers carrying supplies for NATO troops in Afghanistan, officials told Reuters, apparently in retaliation for the incursions into Pakistani territory. No one was wounded, an official said.
After the border closing on Thursday, Senator John Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, spoke with Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani, trying to calm the tensions. That conversation followed a telephone call several days ago between Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and General Kayani, about the previous strikes.
The border closing signaled the limits of Pakistan's tolerance for intrusions on its sovereignty and for the pressure it was willing to absorb from American officials on any range of issues, despite receiving nearly $2 billion a year in military aid from Washington.
The Pakistani government indicated Thursday that the cross-border strikes were more than it could bear without protest. ''We will have to see whether we are allies or enemies,'' said the Pakistani interior minister, Rehman Malik.
At the same time, Pakistani officials tried to contain the damage from a video that came to the attention of American officials in recent days showing the execution of six young men, bound and blindfolded, by Pakistani Army soldiers.
Responding to questions from American officials, Pakistani officials acknowledged Thursday that the video had not been faked, as they had first contended, an American official said, and that they had identified the soldiers and would take appropriate measures.
It is in both the American and the Pakistani interests to keep the relationship going, the official said. The Pakistanis, facing economic collapse after the devastating floods of the summer, need American military aid -- some $10 billion since 2001 -- which could be cut off from units committing atrocities, the official said.
American commanders are eager to continue C.I.A. drone attacks in Pakistan's tribal areas that have focused on militants from the Taliban and Al Qaeda who cross the border to attack NATO and American troops. The Pakistani government has agreed to the drone campaign, but could always suspend its permission or shrink the area in which the strikes are allowed.
The country is also the prime supply route for the Afghan war, a fact Pakistani and American officials are both keenly aware of. The vast majority of nonlethal supplies -- water, food, vehicles -- for the coalition forces in landlocked Afghanistan must travel the length of Pakistan, from the southern port of Karachi to the Afghan border.
Along that route, trucks and fuel tankers have at times been hijacked and attacked by Taliban forces. Pakistani authorities have closed the border crossings only occasionally, however, usually citing security concerns.
But they have rarely appeared to hold up supplies in retaliation for NATO or American actions. In 2008, the Pakistanis closed the border crossing for several days after American aircraft bombed a Pakistani paramilitary post in Mohmand, another tribal area. Eleven Pakistanis were killed in the attack.
American commanders in Afghanistan, long fearful that Pakistan could choke off the supply route more permanently, have been seeking alternate paths through Central Asia, but with little success.
On Thursday, Pakistani officials gave them a glimpse of how much harder they could make the Afghan war. Trucks and oil tankers bound for coalition forces sat idle at the border post of Torkham, just north of Peshawar, with no word on when the post, one of two major land crossings to Afghanistan, would reopen, a Pakistani security official said.
But American officials noted that Pakistan had shut only one of several supply routes to Afghanistan, a sign that the Pakistani government wanted to minimize the episode's fallout.
''We have many different capabilities, routes, ways to resupply, so there's no immediate impact,'' Col. Dave Lapan told reporters in Washington. The blocked route, the Khyber Pass, connects the frontier city of Peshawar to Jalalabad, in eastern Afghanistan.
Colonel Lapan said American military officials were also looking into whether all procedures had been followed properly in the cross-border incidents. The Pakistani government took no similar action and made no such public protest after the earlier coalition airstrikes, even though they killed an estimated 55 people inside Pakistan.
Those strikes, on Sept. 24 and Sept. 25, took place on the border separating Khost Province in Afghanistan from North Waziristan. Coalition helicopters fired into Pakistan three times, with one helicopter briefly breaching Pakistani airspace, according to Maj. Sunset Belinsky, a NATO spokeswoman.
In the airstrike on Thursday, a NATO helicopter attacked a border post at Mandati Kandaw, a town close to Parachinar, in the Kurram tribal area, the Pakistani security official said. Three soldiers of Pakistan's Frontier Corps were killed and three were wounded, he said.
Another border post, at Kharlachi, also in Kurram, was struck a few hours later, the official added. The two posts are about 15 miles apart and border Paktia Province, in Afghanistan.

HEADLINE: Paladino and Columnist: A Couple of Teddy Bears

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN, MICHAEL BARBARO, ELIZABETH A. HARRIS

 BODY:
The fiery confrontation between the Republican candidate for governor, Carl P. Paladino, and the New York Post columnist Fredric U. Dicker transfixed YouTube viewers on Thursday, with the video of the altercation being watched more than 20,000 times.
But the most creative response to the near brawl came from the editors at The Atlantic, who created their own video, transforming the angry candidate and the veteran scribe into animated teddy bears with computer-generated voices.
The video should be rated PG, at least, thanks to its foul language and blunt threats of violence. A bit of the drama is lost, since no one other than Mr. Paladino or Mr. Dicker is portrayed -- no hulking bodyguards, no angry press secretary promising to keep Mr. Dicker off the Christmas list, no journalists hovering in the background. 
Instead, it is mano a mano -- or rather, oso a oso.
Still, the incongruity of the sweet-seeming bears sayings things like ''goons'' and ''Who the hell are you?'' is oddly irresistible.
The bears have become a pop culture phenomenon, thanks to their appearance in a foul-mouthed video, posted this summer by Tiny Watch Productions, highlighting a fight between a Best Buy employee and a customer obsessed with getting an iPhone 4 and not an HTC Evo.DAVID W. CHEN
Habla Espanol?
Linda E. McMahon has so blanketed the airwaves that her opponent for United States senator from Connecticut, Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, has already produced a television commercial complaining about being bombarded by her commercials.
Well, now he may have to do one in Spanish, too.
This week, in the latest example of what a campaign budget projected at $50 million can buy, Ms. McMahon, the former chief executive of World Wrestling Entertainment, rolled out her first Spanish-language ad as part of an effort to woo Hispanic voters. The ad builds upon a radio ad in Spanish earlier in the campaign called ''Alguien Diferente,'' or ''Someone Different.''
The new ad, which is running on Univision in the New York metropolitan area, features a small-business woman who is Hispanic praising Ms. McMahon because ''it's important to change.'' The ad, which is called ''Algo Diferente,'' or ''Something Different,'' features scenes of Ms. McMahon meeting with Hispanic groups, and talking to students, mothers and others.
''I believe she can help many communities by creating more jobs and helping the schools,'' the woman in the ad says.
It is unusual for Connecticut candidates to produce ads in Spanish, said Gary L. Rose, chairman of the department of government and politics at Sacred Heart University. But considering Ms. McMahon's focus on jobs and the economy, her outreach to Hispanics ''makes perfect sense and is very strategic,'' Mr. Rose added.
Ms. McMahon, who majored in French in college, acquits herself linguistically, however. She ends the commercial by speaking in Spanish and saying that she approved the message -- in an accent that even teachers of Spanish might applaud.
She pales, however, in comparison to Representative Jim Himes, a Democrat who lived and worked in South America for years, and often speaks Spanish to Hispanic groups in Bridgeport, Stamford and Norwalk.
But her accent is better than that of another businessman-turned-politician who has made many ads in Spanish, and routinely ends his press conferences in Spanish: Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.DAVID W. CHEN
High Anxiety, Part 1
The e-mails have an almost panicked tone. ''I'm sure you've been reading about the latest polls,'' the candidate wrote to potential donors on Thursday. ''What a roller coaster.''
Another fund-raising pitch, from a prominent supporter, was even blunter. The ''race is tightening,'' the message said.
''We can't take one single vote for granted.''
The surprise: the anxious-sounding candidate is Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, who was supposed to coast this fall, propelled by a vast campaign war chest and unobstructed by a little-known Republican opponent.
But that Republican, Joseph J. DioGuardi, a perennial office seeker best known for his daughter's star turn as an ''American Idol'' judge, is quickly gaining ground, recent polls have suggested, making the race much more competitive than many political analysts had expected.
His strength has jolted the senator's backers, who argued -- perhaps prematurely -- that she had dispatched her most menacing rival: Harold E. Ford Jr., the former Tennessee congressman who decided against challenging her in the Democratic primary.
Ms. Gillibrand has taken to the airwaves with a drumbeat of commercials promoting her record.
And in her e-mail to supporters on Thursday, she pleaded for last-minute contributions.
''I am really counting on you,'' she wrote. ''We have to raise $20,482 in the next 14 hours to meet our budget deadline.''
Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist, weighed in with his own e-mail this week seeking donations for her.
''We're fighting a wave of fury and vitriol from the radical fringe,'' he warned. ''The Republican base is fired up and raring to go.'' MICHAEL BARBARO
High Anxiety, Part 2
The political donations, tax breaks, personal life and fiery temper of Carl P. Paladino have been plumbed by his opponents and by journalists as he campaigns for governor. But one foible has yet to be examined: Mr. Paladino's nail biting.
''It's a terrible habit,'' he said, without casting a glance at his fingers as he made his way through Midtown Manhattan on a recent afternoon. Mr. Paladino's digits bear the tell-tale shortness of nail that can be achieved only with a gnaw.
Asked if he had ever tried to stop, he laughed.
''My mother used to put that no-bite on me,'' he said, describing what is essentially a foul-tasting nail polish.
''It was a terrible taste, but I got used to it. After a while, I liked it.''
Is he trying to stop now?
''I quit smoking in 2005,'' he said, explaining that he had indulged in the habit for decades. ''That's enough.'' ELIZABETH A. HARRIS

HEADLINE: Recession Drove Many To Medicaid Last Year

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

 BODY:
Joblessness and the accompanying loss of health benefits drove an additional 3.7 million people into the Medicaid program last year, the largest single-year increase since the early days of the government insurance plan, according to an annual survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation.
Enrollment in the program, which provides comprehensive coverage to the low-income uninsured, grew by 8.2 percent from December 2008 to December 2009, the second-largest rate of increase in the 10 years that Kaiser has conducted the survey. There were 48.5 million people on Medicaid at the end of 2009, or about one of every six Americans. 
Every state showed enrollment growth, with nine above 15 percent and Nevada and Wisconsin above 20 percent.
Those kinds of increases exact a heavy toll on state budgets, as states share the cost of the Medicaid program with the federal government. The foundation, an independent nonprofit group that conducts research on health policy, found that spending on Medicaid grew 8.8 percent in 2009, the largest increase since 2002.
''We do have horrific pressures on the Medicaid program,'' said Carol A. Herrmann-Steckel, Alabama's Medicaid commissioner.
Last year's spending growth was well above the 6.3 percent increase projected by states at the start of their fiscal years, explaining why virtually every state's program ran a deficit. And it provides a cautionary note for states that have projected a slowed rate of spending growth -- 7.4 percent -- for the current fiscal year.
The only hopeful news found by the survey was that the growth in enrollment slowed considerably in the second half of 2009. Yet, two-thirds of the Medicaid officials surveyed said they thought this year's appropriations might not be enough to cover continuing enrollment growth.
States have been buffered from the harshest recessionary effects of the Medicaid explosion by a series of Congressional appropriations that have temporarily increased the federal share of spending. The stimulus package included $87 billion in Medicaid relief for states, and Congress last month extended the assistance, at a reduced level, through June.
At that point, absent further legislation, the state and federal shares will revert to their historical ratios. If the economy does not recover enough to reverse the enrollment growth, states fear they could be left with an unmanageable burden on their already inadequate revenues. Unlike the federal government, states must balance their budgets.
Without the assistance from Washington, said Vernon K. Smith, a principal with Health Management Associates, which conducted the survey for Kaiser, ''we would have seen cuts on a scale that we've never seen before.''
Adding to the anxiety in state capitals is an expected surge in Medicaid enrollment due to a vast expansion of eligibility for the program under the new health care law. Starting in 2014, the expansion will make the program available to able-bodied adults with incomes up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level (currently $14,404 for a single adult and $29,326 for a family of four). Today, Medicaid, which was enacted in 1965, primarily serves children, pregnant women and the aged and disabled.
The government expects the Medicaid expansion to account for about half of the 32 million uninsured people who are projected to gain coverage because of the new law.
Despite the enhanced federal aid for Medicaid last year, virtually every state made cuts to benefit levels or provider payments in order to balance budgets. As a condition of receiving stimulus money, states were prohibited from lowering eligibility thresholds, which they are allowed to set within federal parameters.
Instead, 39 states cut or froze payments to providers, including 20 states that reduced rates for doctors. That can have the effect of discouraging physicians from accepting Medicaid patients. Twenty states eliminated or restricted benefits like dentistry, imaging services and certain medical equipment. Further cuts are anticipated this year in many states.
States are running out of options for cuts that produce real savings, Mr. Smith said, and are increasingly turning to efficiencies like quality improvements, managed care and computerization.
Enrollment in Medicaid declined as recently as 2006 but began a rapid ascent the next year as the economic downturn began and the unemployment rate started to double.
There is often a lag between the start of a recession and its worst effects on safety net programs. Last year's increases in enrollment and the rate of growth in enrollment were nearly double that of 2008, the survey found. Over three years, Medicaid enrollment has grown by 6.2 million.

HEADLINE: Wall Street Slips at End Of an Upbeat Quarter

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
Shares fell Thursday on Wall Street, but the broader market ended the third quarter with its strongest three-month performance in a year.
Shares started higher on Thursday, helped by reports on weekly unemployment claims, economic growth and regional manufacturing output that exceeded expectations. But as the day wore on, the major indexes slipped, taking some of the edge off a September rally and raising questions about whether the surge could be maintained.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 47.23 points, or 0.4 percent, at 10,788.05. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 3.53 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,141.20, while the Nasdaq composite index dropped 7.94 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,368.62. 
The broader market, using the S.& P. as a gauge, has risen nearly 9 percent this month, its best September performance since 1939. The index has risen 10.72 percent in the three months from June 30, its best quarter since the third period of 2009. The Dow gained 10 percent in the quarter and the Nasdaq rose 12.29 percent.
Tom di Galoma, head of United States rates trading at Guggenheim Securities, attributed the rally to the Federal Reserve. ''The start of the bull market in the last quarter,'' Mr. di Galoma said, came after the Fed's announcement in August that it would try to bolster the economy by buying long-term Treasuries and the subsequent talk of quantitative easing.
Analysts said the rally occurred despite the relative absence of improved economic data, meaning investors had probably adjusted their expectations. In addition, trading volume in the quarter was down 23 percent compared with the year-earlier period as uncertainty kept many investors on the sidelines.
''The market moved up on good news but did not move down on bad news,'' said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst for Standard & Poor's. ''There is still an enormous amount of uncertainty about where to put your money.''
Most of the data in the quarter reinforced the notion that the economy was growing, though very slowly, calming concerns about the potential for a double-dip recession.
The broadest measure of the nation's economic activity, gross domestic product, for example, grew in the second quarter at an annual pace of 1.7 percent, down from 3.7 percent in the first. While government data in the first two months of the quarter showed that businesses added more jobs than originally estimated, the unemployment rate remained just below 10 percent.
And the housing industry continued to struggle, feeling the fallout from the expired home buyer tax credit. Sales tumbled 27 percent in July, their second-weakest level since 1997, though they started to stabilize in August.
For most of the quarter, the Fed was a factor in the markets. Its announcement in early August that it would buy long-term Treasury debt with proceeds from its mortgage-related bond portfolio reassured traders, at least for a while. Last week, the Fed said that it was worried that the sluggish recovery could be undermined by very low rates of inflation.
The Fed's policy-making arm then deferred a decision on whether to begin a new push to speed the recovery by additional purchases of financial assets, which would increase the money supply. Stock prices responded by initially rising before falling back in the absence of bolder steps.
Jeffrey Nichols, the senior economic adviser to Rosland Capital, said rising expectations of more creation of money by the Fed helped gold prices shatter the psychologically important level of $1,300 an ounce.
''I think the latest news suggesting that they might buy a range of securities without any time frame was taken as being sort of an open-ended possibility of much greater monetary easing, which is positive for gold,'' Mr. Nichols said. ''There are enough investors who are worried about inflation, and expectations are rising because of Fed policy.''
Since the Fed's Aug. 10 decision to buy government debt, ''more investors took a greater interest in gold,'' said Mr. Nichols, who is also the managing director of American Precious Metals Advisors.
In general, Treasury rates have fallen steadily through the quarter. The price of the 10-year Treasury note fell 2/32, to 101, on Thursday, while the yield rose to 2.51 percent from 2.50 percent late Wednesday.
In the currency market, the dollar finished the third quarter lower against a range of currencies, including the yen.
Japan intervened in international currency markets in September for the first time since 2004, buying dollars and selling yen and weakening its currency in a bid to protect its export-led economy.
''It has been a miserable quarter for the U.S. dollar,'' Marc Chandler, the global head of currency strategy for Brown Brothers Harriman, said.
Even so, the dollar was still higher against the euro and the British pound than it was at the beginning of the year.
''In some ways, the big picture for the third quarter was very unusual,'' Mr. Chandler said, ''in the sense that the stock market rallied, bonds rallied and gold rallied.''

HEADLINE: INTO THE MIX: Chef a Late Entry in Senate Race

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
One more cook is jumping into the stew that is the South Carolina Senate race.
Nathalie Dupree, a prominent Charleston chef and cookbook author, is announcing her write-in candidacy Thursday in an 11th-hour challenge to Senator Jim DeMint, the Republican incumbent, and Alvin Greene, the unemployed Democratic nominee. 
The last United States senator to be elected through a write-in campaign was Strom Thurmond, also from South Carolina, in 1954. Ms. Dupree hopes to follow in his footsteps.She may be known chiefly for her shrimp and grits, but Ms. Dupree, 70, hopes to change the subject to Mr. DeMint who, she said in a telephone interview, is devoting his time and money to insurgent Republicans in other states rather than helping people in his own poor state. And that, she said, has prompted her to run.
She is expected to announce her candidacy in Columbia and Charleston.
She said in the interview that she was particularly irked at Mr. DeMint's opposition to getting federal money to dredge the Charleston harbor, which she said the city needed to compete economically with other ports.
''I'm going to make it clear that Jim DeMint doesn't care for the people of South Carolina as much as he does for his own ego,'' she said.
The DeMint campaign has yet to respond to her comments.
Ms. Dupree said that when she decided last week to get into the race, her husband -- Jack Bass, an historian and author -- told her that she could make a ''credible showing,'' but asked how she would feel if she came in last.
''I said that I would have said what needed to be said,'' she said. ''We have had so many backward politicians,'' she added, pointing to Mark Sanford, the governor, and Mr. DeMint. Referring to the state's other Republican senator, she added: ''Anybody who can't work with Lindsey Graham to accomplish something doesn't have many political skills.''
As for the Democratic nominee, Alvin Greene, Ms. Dupree said: ''He hasn't said a word about Jim DeMint, and he's really not running a campaign.''
Mr. DeMint is way ahead of Mr. Greene in the polls, and it is not clear at this point whether Ms. Dupree's late entry will make any difference to voters, but she said it matters to her.
''I can run because I have nothing to lose, and I can state the truth to the people of South Carolina, who know me,'' she said. ''They've known me for 20 some years on TV. I've been in their homes.''
She is assembling a campaign team and said she expected to spend $60,000 to $100,000, including for advertising. She is in the market right now for a goose, though they are out of season, because she wants one for a new commercial.
''I want to cook his goose,'' Ms. Dupree said of Mr. DeMint. ''And it's time to bring home the bacon.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: TARP Cost Will Be Less Than Once Expected

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Even as voters rage and candidates put up ads against government bailouts, the reviled mother of them all -- the $700 billion lifeline to banks, insurance and auto companies -- will expire after Sunday at a fraction of that cost, and could conceivably earn taxpayers a profit.
A final accounting of the government's full range of interventions in the economy, including the bailouts of the mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, is years off and will most likely remain controversial and potentially costly.
But the once-unthinkable possibility that the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program could end up costing far less, or even nothing, became more likely on Thursday with the news that the government had negotiated a plan with the American International Group to begin repaying taxpayers. 
The rescue of the troubled insurer included $70 billion from the bailout program that was enacted two years ago, at the height of the global financial crisis late in the Bush administration, initially to prop up big banks.
At the White House on Thursday, the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, briefed President Obama about A.I.G. and about the broader outlook for the expiring rescue program, putting the projected losses at less than $50 billion, at most. Yet neither the White House nor Congressional Democrats are likely to boast much in the month remaining before midterm elections. For most voters, TARP remains a four-letter word.
Brian A. Bethune, the chief financial economist in the United States for IHS/Global Insight, while critical of parts, called the program over all ''a tremendous success. Now obviously, they can't go out on the campaign trail and say that, because certainly, for a lot of voters, it's just not going to resonate.''
The ''bank bailout'' was the first big issue, before the Obama administration's roughly $800 billion stimulus plan and its health insurance overhaul, to stoke the rise of the Tea Party movement. After supporting TARP, several Republicans have lost elections largely because of their votes. For many Americans, TARP is more than a vote; it is a symbol of big government at its worst, intervening in private markets with taxpayers' billions to save Wall Street plutocrats while average Americans struggle through the recession those financiers spawned.
Fewer than three in 10 Americans say they believe the program was necessary ''to prevent the financial industry from failing and drastically hurting the U.S. economy,'' according to a poll in July for Bloomberg News.
''This is the best federal program of any real size to be despised by the public like this,'' said Douglas J. Elliott, a former investment banker now associated with the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank.
''It was probably the only effective method available to us to keep from having a financial meltdown much worse than we actually had. Had that happened, unemployment would be substantially higher than it is now, the deficit would have gone up even more than it has,'' Mr. Elliott added. ''But it really cuts against the grain for a public that is so angry at banks to think that something that so plainly helped the banks could also be good for the public.''
After Sunday the Treasury can no longer commit money to new initiatives or recycle repayments to other purposes.
The Treasury never tapped the full $700 billion. It committed $470 billion and has disbursed $387 billion, mostly to hundreds of banks and later to A.I.G., the car industry -- Chrysler, General Motors, the G.M. financing company and suppliers -- and to what is, so far, a failed effort to help homeowners avoid foreclosures.
When Mr. Obama took office, the financial system remained so weak that his first budget indicated the Treasury might need another $750 billion for TARP. The administration soon dropped that idea as Mr. Geithner overhauled the rescue program and the banking system stabilized. Still, by mid-2009, the administration projected that TARP could lose $341 billion, a figure that reflected new commitments to A.I.G. and the auto industry.
The Congressional Budget Office, which had a slightly higher loss estimate initially, in August reduced that to $66 billion.
Now Treasury reckons that taxpayers will lose less than $50 billion at worst, but at best could break even or even make money. Its best-case assumptions, however, assume that A.I.G. and the auto companies will remain profitable and that Treasury will get a good price as it sells its corporate shares in coming years.
''We'd have to be very lucky to have both A.I.G. and the auto companies pay us back in full,'' Mr. Elliott said.
Also, the best result for taxpayers could mean bad results for squeezed homeowners. Treasury has been ready to use up to $50 billion to help modify mortgages for people facing foreclosure, but its initiatives have been such a failure that little has been spent.
Whatever the final losses from housing, auto companies, A.I.G. or smaller banks, those will be offset by taxpayers' profits from the big banks that have been the focus of their ire since 2008.
They have repaid their loans and Treasury has collected about $25 billion more from dividends and proceeds from the sale of warrants held as collateral, officials say. Many smaller banks hold on to their loans, however, reflecting their weakness and the desire of some others to keep the money given its advantageous terms. Scores are behind on dividend payments to the Treasury.
By any measure, TARP's final tally will be less than expected amid the crisis. But the program remains a big loser politically.
On Wednesday, four days before its expiration, House Republicans nonetheless unsuccessfully forced a vote on legislation to end TARP. ''We would be much better served if private institutions would either fail or be successful on their own,'' said Representative Erik Paulsen of Minnesota, in an interview.
Among those who voted for the program in 2008, several Republicans have lost nominating contests for re-election or for another office, and others are on the defensive in fall races.
Senator Robert F. Bennett of Utah was ''Bailout Bob'' to Republicans who refused to re-nominate him for a fourth term.
''For those who were screaming at me -- and screaming was the operative word -- 'You've just saddled our children and grandchildren with $700 billion,' I said, 'No, I haven't,'' Mr. Bennett said in an interview.
''My career is over,'' he added. ''But I do hope that we can get the word out that TARP, number one, did save the world from a financial meltdown and, number two, did so in a manner that, I believe, won't cost the taxpayer anything. And even if it did not all get paid back, it was still the thing to do.''

HEADLINE: Interior Department Toughens Rules for Offshore Oil Operations

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Interior Department tightened its rules on offshore oil and gas operations on Thursday but left in place the moratorium on deepwater drilling that has left oil executives frustrated and Gulf Coast officials fuming.
The new rules -- governing well casing and cementing, blowout preventers, safety certification, emergency response and worker training -- provide offshore drillers with clarity on the terms under which drilling will resume when the current freeze ends.
The main conditions had already been telegraphed by the department in a safety report issued in May and in two notices to offshore operators handed down in June in response to the blowout of a BP well in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20. 
That accident, which resulted in the worst offshore oil spill in American history, killed 11 rig workers and spewed nearly five million barrels of oil into the gulf.
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar presented the new rules in a speech Thursday morning, calling them a fundamental change that will guide all future leasing and development decisions in the gulf, the Arctic and elsewhere.
''We are raising the bar for safety, oversight and environmental protection at every stage of the drilling process,'' he said in the speech, at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars here.
The rules take effect immediately under emergency rule-making powers.
In an interview, Mr. Salazar said he expected oil companies to complain, but to quickly comply.
''We'll hear from industry that the regulations are too onerous, but the fact is, it's a new day,'' he said. ''There is the pre-April 20 framework of regulation and the post-April 20 framework, and the oil and gas industry better get used to it, because that's the way it's going to be.''
The secretary pointedly refused to say when or under what conditions he would lift the drilling suspension, which has caused economic hardship along the Gulf Coast and political headaches for the Obama administration.
''We will lift it at our own time and when we're ready, and not based on political pressure from anyone,'' Mr. Salazar said.
The moratorium on deepwater drilling, imposed in late April, is scheduled to end on Nov. 30, but officials have signaled that it will probably be eased before then.
Senator Mary Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana and a strong ally of the oil industry, is blocking the confirmation of Jack Lew as the new White House budget director until the moratorium is lifted or substantially eased.
Michael R. Bromwich, director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement, the Interior Department office that now polices offshore drilling, was to deliver a report to Mr. Salazar shortly providing a blueprint for safely resuming drilling.
Mr. Salazar said he would review the report before deciding when that might happen.
On Thursday, the White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, said the new regulations and the completion of the Bromwich report ''likely'' meant that the drilling pause would end before Nov. 30.
Mr. Bromwich indicated this week that even after the moratorium was lifted, it could be weeks or even months before his agency granted permits allowing the 33 idled deepwater rigs in the gulf to start up again. Permits would be issued only after companies provided new spill response plans that detailed certification of the performance of critical equipment, like blowout preventers.
Oil industry executives expressed resignation about the new rules, saying they could be met, at some cost.
Marvin E. Odum, the president of Shell Oil, said in an interview that his company had weathered the moratorium so far by renegotiating contracts on its seven idle deepwater rigs in the gulf, allowing it to keep most of its skilled workers on the payroll.
''The piece I'm more concerned about is that when the moratorium does get lifted, you won't be able to get back to work until the permit system starts to flow again,'' Mr. Odum said. ''Will it be weeks, months? That's the big question.''
Environmental advocates generally praised the new rules.
Jacqueline Savitz, a senior scientist at Oceana, a nonprofit environmental group, said that the new regulations alone would not prevent another spill.
''The BP disaster occurred because standards were not met and monitoring and inspections were too lax,'' she said. ''While stricter standards might help, adding them ignores the fact that there is simply no guarantee they will be followed.''
She urged Mr. Salazar to continue the freeze on deepwater drilling and extend it to shallow-water wells.

HEADLINE: Rifts Show at Hearing On For-Profit Colleges

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
Senator John McCain did not spend long on Thursday at a committee hearing in Washington about for-profit colleges.
Mr. McCain, Republican of Arizona, read briefly from a lobbyist's opinion piece supporting the colleges, then accused the committee chairman, Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, of going on ''ad nauseam'' about the abuses at for-profits. He added that he hoped the committee would have a different agenda come January -- and then walked out.
It was the latest sign that for-profit colleges have become a polarizing force in Washington. On Wednesday, hundreds of students from for-profit colleges rallied at the Capitol, many wearing T-shirts proclaiming, ''My education. My job. My choice.'' 
And the industry has taken out advertisements in many publications, and produced a stream of reports and op-ed articles extolling the colleges' benefits.
But Senator Harkin's panel, the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, is doggedly amassing a small mountain of data to support its case that the colleges are helping themselves, at the students' expense. At the hearing, he released a report, based on his committee's document request to 30 for-profit colleges, showing that many students leave with large debts, and no diplomas.
About 95 percent of students take out loans to enroll at for-profit colleges, the report said, compared with only 16 percent at community colleges. And more than half the students who started at the for-profit schools in the 2008-2009 year had withdrawn by this August.
In a conference call Thursday, Harris Miller, the president of the Association of Private Sector Colleges and Universities, took issue with those findings, saying that they do not agree with other data on for-profit colleges' outcomes.
Mr. Miller said for-profit colleges do better than other institutions in helping nontraditional students, and that taxpayers spend far less on students at for-profit colleges than on those at public colleges that get large government subsidies.
The for-profit colleges produce large profits, Senator Harkin's study found -- with 16 of the schools making $2.7 billion last year. One school had a 37 percent profit margin, and another had a 33 percent margin.
With for-profit colleges getting 85 percent of their revenues from federal student aid, and taxpayers providing the schools $24 billion a year through grants and loans to students, those profits come from taxpayers.
''The system has a problem,'' Mr. Harkin said. ''The system invites abuse.''
Mr. Harkin said he would hold another hearing in December, then introduce legislation.
The current battleground for the for-profit colleges is the Education Department's proposed ''gainful employment'' rule, which would cut off federal student aid to programs whose graduates have high debt loads, and are failing to get jobs that will allow them to repay those debts.
The department received more than 90,000 comments on the proposed rule, the most ever on an education issue. On Sept. 24 the federal education secretary, Arne Duncan, said he would delay issuing the final version of the rule to study the comments.
For-profit colleges argue that the rule would harm the most vulnerable students by cutting their education choices. But consumer and education groups counter that the rule would help weed out programs that prey on students for their financial aid.
Students at for-profit colleges, about 10 percent of the nation's college students, account for about 43 percent of those who defaulted this year on loans they began paying off in 2008.
Mr. Harkin argued against for-profits -- citing high tuition and student debt, and deceptive recruiting -- in an op-ed article last month in The Washington Post, which owns Kaplan, one of the largest for-profit colleges.
Then Margaret Spellings, George W. Bush's education secretary from 2005 to 2009, wrote an op-ed article in The Post, arguing that, particularly in tough economic times, the administration should not do anything limiting access to educational options.
Lanny Davis, a Clinton administration special counsel who is now an adviser to a group of privately owned for-profit colleges, wrote on The Huffington Post that the government crackdown on for-profit colleges had an elitist, racist feel and seemed to reflect a distaste for profits.
Mr. McCain read briefly from Mr. Davis' posting at the hearing Thursday before walking out.
Also at the hearing, a career adviser at Education Management Corporation, a large for-profit company, testified that she had been shown by a colleague how to manufacture fake e-mails from graduates and to falsify earnings data.
The adviser, Kathleen Bittel, said she reported those practices to her supervisor, but instead of disciplinary action, the colleague won the company's ''North Star'' award. She also testified that part of her job was persuading graduates that their jobs used their training. That meant persuading a graduate who took on $100,000 in student debt for a bachelor's degree in game art and design, that he had a job in his field, when he was earning $8.90 an hour in the video game department at Toys ''R'' Us.
The company said it had investigated her claims and seen no evidence of any manipulation.

HEADLINE: At Hearing, a Dispute Over Banking Provision in Reform Law

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The unity of regulators who have to put the Dodd-Frank financial reform law into effect was put to the test at a Congressional hearing Thursday as squabbling emerged over a provision affecting lenders.
The disagreement involved a measure requiring lenders to keep at least 5 percent of the credit risk when they bundle and sell debt.
Before the housing market collapsed in 2007, many mortgage originators made reckless loans, in part because they were able to quickly sell them to other investors to lay off the risk. The new law required regulators to change that. 
So on Monday, the board of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation voted 4 to 1 to approve a rule that makes ''risk retention'' by banks a condition for any bank that wants protection under new accounting rules if the bank were to fail.
In principle, the rule was consistent with the new law, but because other agencies needed to adopt their own, similar regulations to conform to the law, the timing of the vote rankled other regulators and some lawmakers.
''I know you sort of jumped out in advance of everybody in that regard, and I'm just wondering if you've had any input from the other agencies,'' Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, asked the F.D.I.C. chairwoman, Sheila C. Bair, at the hearing.
Ms. Bair replied that the F.D.I.C. had no choice but to act because it faced a deadline relating to new accounting standards. ''If we didn't do something we would have disrupted the securitization market,'' she said.
But John Walsh, acting head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, who sits on the F.D.I.C. board and was the lone opposition vote, testified that the deadline could have been extended, and that ''we didn't see any great downside'' to doing so.
Mr. Corker wryly observed, ''I sense a slightly less playing-well-together than appeared.''
The F.D.I.C. vote irritated the Treasury Department, whose leader, Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, has occasionally clashed with Ms. Bair. In addition, the American Securitization Forum, which represents 350 companies involved in the packaging and sale of loans, said the F.D.I.C. had ''acted ahead of other regulators in an uncoordinated manner.''
The issue is hardly the most urgent one requiring regulatory coordination, but members of the Senate Banking Committee made it clear Thursday that they were concerned that the process be harmonious.
One of the crucial questions in the months ahead is whether the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission can overcome an entrenched rivalry and jointly develop rules governing over-the-counter derivatives.
''Mark my words here this morning: there will be another crisis, as certain as we're sitting here,'' said the committee's chairman, Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and one of the leading authors of the act. ''Greed and recklessness will rear their heads again.''
Mr. Dodd said that ''we have provided regulators with the tools they need to see it coming and to put a stop to it in time,'' but cautioned, ''Whether they will actually do so largely depends upon the foundation laid by those of you who are before us today.''
Among its many provisions, the law created a body of regulators, the Financial Stability Oversight Council, led by the Treasury secretary, which will meet for the first time on Friday. Over the long run, the council, which is supposed to watch out for future risks to the financial system, will test the ability of regulators to work together.
The initial meeting -- to be streamed live on the Treasury Department's Web site -- will touch upon two big areas that will require regulators to cooperate.
The council will begin a discussion of which criteria to use in determining whether a nonbank financial company is ''systemically important'' and therefore needs to be supervised by the Federal Reserve. The council will also start a process for hashing out details of the Volcker Rule, a much-debated provision of the law that is intended to restrict banks from making certain kinds of speculative investments if they are not on behalf of their clients.
Neal S. Wolin, deputy Treasury secretary, testified that the council was required under the law to commission four studies: two relating to the Volcker Rule, one concerning the risk-retention issue that the F.D.I.C. had already acted upon; and a final one concerning ''the overall economic effect'' of the Dodd-Frank law.
But Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the top Republican on the Banking Committee, who opposed the law, criticized the whole enterprise.
''By delegating the major policy decisions -- and therefore, most of the real work -- to the regulators, the Dodd-Frank legislation undermines the effectiveness of our regulators by asking them to do too much,'' Mr. Shelby said.

HEADLINE: A Message for China

 BODY:
China and President Obama have a lot to think about after the House voted, overwhelmingly, on Wednesday to give the Obama administration expanded authority to impose tariffs on nearly all Chinese imports.
Protectionist impulses run far too strong on Capitol Hill, especially in an election year. But China's aggressive undervaluation of its currency is providing a hugely unfair boost to its exports -- hurting some American exports, but doing a lot more damage to others and hindering the recovery around the world.
If the House vote grabs Beijing's attention, that would be a good thing. We are skeptical that punitive tariffs are the answer. They wouldn't provide all that much redress to American companies because at this point, except for steel and a few other products, most of the things Americans buy from China: TVs, refrigerators, toys -- are no longer made here. 
As for whether tariffs would change Beijing's thinking, we fear there is at least an equal chance that China will lash back. A trade war would be disastrous for bilateral relations, complicating efforts to contain nuclear programs in Iran and North Korea, and disastrous for the world economy.
A more effective strategy would be to muster the support of the many other countries whose manufacturing industries have been mauled. China needs to hear and see that its currency policy is a global problem that is undermining the global influence it so clearly desires.
So far, Beijing has used its clout as a major foreign investor and the world's biggest importer of raw materials to mollify or intimidate its potential critics. The Obama administration needs to be at least as determined in its efforts to persuade others to finally speak up.
A lot of that can and should be done with behind-the-scenes diplomacy. There is also an important public part to be played. One of the best venues to get the message across -- to Beijing and other world capitals -- is at the World Trade Organization. China, which relies so heavily on exports, keeps an especially close watch there.
Last month, Washington filed two W.T.O. cases against China for duties it slapped on American steel and its discrimination against American suppliers of electronic payment services. It would be unlikely to win a case on China's currency manipulation (which the World Trade Organization does not define as illegal). A broad challenge against China's illegal trade practices, including providing subsidized energy and cheap credit to its exporters, could help embolden others to put forth their own complaints.
This strategy also carries the risk of retaliation. But the United States can't be paralyzed, and moving with others should lessen that threat. A few other countries are already speaking out. Japan has begun criticizing China's currency policies. Brazil's finance minister complained earlier this week about the ''international currency war'' set off by the manipulation of China's currency, the renminbi.
As the vote in the House loomed, Beijing defiantly slapped steep tariffs on poultry from the United States. On the day of the vote, Foreign Ministry officials warned of potentially dire consequences to bilateral trade relations, and China's central bank let the renminbi fall a little. Still, over the last three weeks, the bank allowed the currency to rise about 1.5 percent against the dollar, roughly three times as much as it appreciated in the previous three months.
Hours before the House vote, China's central bank issued a statement pledging to ''increase currency flexibility,'' and ''gradually improve the exchange rate setting mechanism.'' Beijing has made these promises before. Which is why the United States and other countries need to push harder, together.

HEADLINE: Residents Worry About Post-Daley Budgets and Public Services

BYLINE: By MICK DUMKE

 BODY:
As Mayor Richard M. Daley prepares to leave office, some of his most loyal supporters are upset about the financial troubles he will leave behind and worried that the city services they have come to expect are in rapid decline.
''People are saying, 'Where does our money go?' '' said Tom Allen, alderman of the 38th Ward on the Northwest Side, where residents are predominantly white and middle class. ''If things are going along smoothly and there's money flowing and everybody's life is in order, nobody pays attention to what they're doing downtown with our money. But when things go bad, people start wondering.''
Mr. Daley took office when Chicago was deeply divided by race, and he has stressed that he is a mayor for all of Chicago. Still, his political base has always been in the mostly white neighborhoods. When Mr. Daley was elected to his sixth term in 2007, he received 71 percent of the votes citywide, but he won 84 percent in the city's 17 majority-white wards. While these wards accounted for just 39 percent of all the votes cast for mayor, they provided Mr. Daley with almost half of his vote total. 
Though the white population in the city is decreasing, voter turnout in these wards tends to be the highest in the city. The increasing frustration with diminishing city services in those areas presents an enormous challenge: the next mayor will have to win over residents of the North, Northwest and Southwest sides without neglecting struggling black and Latino communities, where many residents believe the mayor paid them scant attention.
It all has to be done without the new mayor overpromising: The city faces an estimated $655 million budget deficit for 2011, and Mr. Daley has said services may have to be cut further.
''Somebody's going to have to come up with some ideas about pulling us out of the hole we're in,'' said Alderman Bernard Stone, who has represented the 50th Ward on the far North Side since 1973. ''There has to at least be some promise of better days ahead, because people are not happy.''
Mr. Daley still has plenty of supporters in the white wards, including Christine Olsinski, a Polish-language interpreter who lives in the Jefferson Park neighborhood. Ms. Olsinski said she was disappointed that the mayor wasn't running for re-election.
''He did a terrific job -- the best he could,'' she said.
But she said she is troubled by the loss of thousands of jobs in the city. On Monday, Ms. Olsinski was shopping at Krakus Polish Deli, a bustling business on a block of North Milwaukee Avenue where several storefronts have been vacant for years.
While many business leaders will not criticize Mr. Daley directly, they say that whoever leads the city next will have to do more to spur economic development and help employers.
Brian Nadig, publisher of Nadig Newspapers, a chain of community papers on the Northwest Side, said most area business leaders are not yet thinking about who they are going to support in the municipal elections. ''Most business owners are worried about keeping their doors open for the next month,'' he said.
Mr. Nadig, who is also the president of the Jefferson Park Chamber of Commerce, said budget deficits have forced the city to cut back on staff who worked on economic development, including those who recruited new businesses and pressured the absentee landlords of troubled properties to improve or sell them. The number of vacant buildings has soared over the last several years, he said.
''As a chamber, we don't want the city to issue citations to a business,'' Mr. Nadig said, ''but if a landlord has had an empty storefront for 20 years without advertising it's for rent, we can't tolerate that.''
As property and sales-tax revenues plunged in the last few years, city officials created other income streams to balance the budget, including new or increased regulations and fees for business signage, building permits and operating licenses. In 2009, for example, the city imposed a tax on garbage dumpsters.
Mr. Nadig and other business leaders said those measures have heaped additional burdens on already struggling small businesses.
''What we're looking for is a better partnership with the city,'' said David Wians, president of the Gladstone Park Chamber of Commerce. ''A lot of businesses are leaving the city because it's so expensive here.''
Mr. Wians said the mayor's deal to privatize the parking meter system has also hurt businesses, because some shoppers are not willing to pay more to park. Hourly rates range from $1.25 in the neighborhoods to $4.25 at some spots downtown.
Mr. Wians said the meters have made ''a huge impact on businesses'' in Edgebrook, a neighborhood on the northern edge of the city where he is a board member of the local chamber of commerce. ''It used to be that you couldn't find a parking space there,'' he said, ''but now nobody wants to pay, so people just go up to Niles to shop.''
Tony Priola, a retired police officer, grew frustrated one afternoon earlier this week as he slid a credit card into a parking pay box on Devon Avenue in Edgebrook. ''We've run out of the parking meter money already, and now they're talking about selling off Midway Airport?'' he said. ''What's going to be left for our kids?''
Mr. Priola said he was even more distressed by the prospect that potential mayoral candidates might not have any better ideas for balancing the budget. ''I don't want to hear from those guys who promise things like, 'I'm not going to spend any money,' '' he said. ''I want to hear some serious ideas -- ideas that I can understand.''
Alderman Stone said his constituents are angry that while they are still paying their taxes, the city's budget problems have forced a slowdown in services. ''There are a lot of things people have gotten used to that we can't do properly now because we don't have the money, and nobody likes it, including me,'' he said.
Public safety has also become a top concern, even in neighborhoods with relatively low crime rates. City payroll records show that police ranks are hundreds of officers thinner than two years ago, because of budget cuts.
About 70 people attended a community policing meeting Monday night at a Park District fieldhouse in the West Lawn neighborhood, a Southwest Side community of brick bungalows and expansive parks. Residents talked with police and community organizers about a number of public-safety issues, including a recent shooting.
Edie Cavanaugh, a 33-year resident of the neighborhood, asked why police had not responded to her repeated phone calls for help in recent weeks. She said her neighbors had been throwing all-night parties with disc jockeys and light shows. In addition to making it impossible to sleep, she said, the partiers sent a message that the neighborhood was out of control.
The one time police showed up, they quickly left without doing anything, Ms. Cavanaugh said. She worried that crime would worsen.
A police sergeant promised to look into the matter, but Ms. Cavanaugh remained exasperated. After the meeting she said several of her neighbors were planning to move out of the community or had already done so. ''We need more police patrolling the streets,'' she said.
Ms. Cavanaugh blamed the mayor and the City Council for not paying enough attention to neighborhoods like hers. ''They all need to go,'' she said.
After the Dynasty: This is the first article in a series that will look at Chicago's future without Mayor Richard M. Daley.

Movies
Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.
'Ahead of Time' (No rating, 1:13, in English and Hebrew) The career of Ruth Gruber -- reporter, photographer, civil servant, memoirist, humanitarian and riveting raconteur, now 99 -- is remarkable, and not only for a woman of her generation. This documentary covers the striking breadth of its early years (the '30s and '40s), enlivened by her lucid memory and sensible, compassionate bearing. (Andy Webster)20100930
'Alpha and Omega' (PG, 1:28) This animated film about talking wolves in the Canadian Rockies that learn lessons about cooperation and love occasionally has a touch of old-fashioned grandeur in its western vistas, but otherwise it's funny-animal and noble-beast business as usual. (Mike Hale)20100930 
'The American' (R, 1:45) George Clooney is a shadowy assassin-type who settles down in an Italian village, where trouble follows him and he falls for a local prostitute played by Violante Placido. It all looks good -- Mr. Clooney, Ms. Placido, Italy -- and the director, Anton Corbijn, manages a quiet, oblique tone. But in the end the movie is not much more than an anthology of beautiful shots and world-weary attitudes. The Henry James novel by the same name is much better. (A. O. Scott)20100930
- 'Animal Kingdom' (R, 1:52) The relative absence of gun battles and car chases in ''Animal Kingdom,'' a powerfully acted Australian answer to ''Goodfellas,'' helps it sustain a mood of deepening dread. It goes out of its way to deglamorize the criminal life and portray its family of crooks as warped psychotic thugs in a losing enterprise. (Stephen Holden)20100930
'Buried' (R, 1:35) This horror movie with delusions of moral grandeur portrays the ordeal of a nonmilitary truck driver in Iraq (Ryan Reynolds) who is buried alive and held for ransom. Though sloppy and overwrought, it pricks your deepest terrors of claustrophobic confinement. (Holden)20100930
'Catfish' (PG-13, 1:26) A sloppy, shallow, ethically compromised documentary and also a fascinating document of life, love and self-creation in the age of Facebook. (Scott)20100930
'Devil' (PG-13, 1:20) This serviceable burst of high-end hokum traps five strangers in an elevator in a Philadelphia office tower, all harboring sins in dire need of atonement. Classing up a flimsy, religion-themed plot (by M. Night Shyamalan) with the kind of limber cinematography only someone like Tak Fujimoto can deliver, the director John Erick Dowdle remains cool when the lights fail and the blood begins to flow. (Jeannette Catsoulis)20100930
'Easy A' (PG-13, 1:33) Whatever else it accomplishes, the sassy high school comedy ''Easy A'' commands attention for the irresistible presence of Emma Stone, playing a good girl who pretends to be bad. (Holden)20100930
'Eat Pray Love' (PG-13, 2:13) Post-divorce spiritual globe-trotting, starring Julia Roberts, from Elizabeth Gilbert's best-selling memoir. Nothing to change your life, but honest and satisfying all the same. (Scott)20100930
- 'Enter the Void' (No rating, 2:17, in French) This is your brain. This is your brain on a Gaspar Noe movie. (Manohla Dargis)20100930
'Genius Within: The Inner Life of Glenn Gould' (No rating, 1:46) This thorough biography of the Canadian pianist acknowledges his eccentricities and examines some previously unknown details of his personal life, but spends most of its energy making the case that he was an artist whose importance went far beyond his innovative interpretations of Bach and other composers. (Scott)20100930
- 'Get Low' (PG-13, 1:42) Robert Duvall plays a Tennessee hermit who arranges his own funeral while he is still alive. Bill Murray is the undertaker who agrees to organize the service, and Sissy Spacek is an old flame of the not quite deceased. The story, based on a real-life anecdote of Depression-era Appalachia, veers into some corny and overfamiliar territory, but the telling is easy and assured, and the cast is hard to beat. (Scott)20100930
'The Girl Who Played With Fire' (No rating, 2:09, in Swedish) Lisbeth Salander returns, framed for murder and embroiled in an investigation that leads in the direction of her monstrous father. This Swedish-language adaptation of the second novel in Stieg Larsson's best-selling trilogy is better than its predecessor, but apart from Noomi Rapace's ferocious performance as Lisbeth, it doesn't rise about the level of not-bad television. (Scott)20100930
'Heartbreaker' (No rating, 1:44, in French) This slapstick-infused French imitation of a Hollywood romantic comedy is saved by Romain Duris's frisky portrayal of an ethical gigolo who is hired to break up mismatched couples, without sleeping with the women. (Holden)20100930
- 'Howl' (No rating, 1:30) Not your standard biopic. Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman's film uses the documentary record, some rather literal-minded animation (by Eric Drooker) and the talents of James Franco to recreate the time, place and impact of Allen Ginsberg's ''Howl.'' A rare and genuine work of literary criticism on film, this movie has the power to return you to a great poem with fresh eyes and ears. (Scott)20100930
- 'I Am Love' (No rating, 2:00, in Italian) A visually lush melodrama from Luca Guadagnino about the young matriarch (Tilda Swinton) of a wealthy Milanese family whose passions and suffering fuel this art-house gloss on the women's picture. (Dargis)20100930
'I'm Still Here' (R, 1:48) The actor Joaquin Phoenix puts himself front and center in this gloss on the mutually parasitic worlds of celebritydom and the entertainment media. His brother-in-law, the actor Casey Affleck, plays the director. (Dargis)20100930
'Inception' (PG-13, 2:32) This elegantly action-filled brainteaser from Christopher Nolan (''The Dark Knight,'' ''Memento'') stars Leonardo DiCaprio as a spy for hire who burrows into the dreams of his targets and nearly gets lost in his own subconscious, where a mysterious woman played by Marion Cotillard is waiting for him. The film is entertaining enough but not quite up to its grandest ambitions, and it works best as a heist movie with a few extra twists and visual surprises. (Scott)20100930
'Jack Goes Boating' (R, 1:31) Philip Seymour Hoffman directs and stars in this mopey, minor-key story, adapted from Robert Glaudini's play, about a shy, sad fellow looking for love. Amy Ryan is the woman he falls for, but Daphne Rubin-Vega and John Ortiz as Jack's best friends (a volatile married couple) give the film its heart and authenticity. (Scott)20100930
- 'The Kids Are All Right' (R, 1:45) American family life in all its imperfections, perfectly captured by the director Lisa Cholodenko and a flawless, peerless cast led by Julianne Moore and Annette Bening as a lesbian couple with two teenage children and a couple of decades worth of unspoken tensions and frustration. These pop to the surface when Mark Ruffalo shows up, playing the children's biological but heretofore invisible father. What follows is brilliantly funny without exaggeration, and heartbreaking without a hint of melodramatic manipulation. (Scott)20100930
- 'Kings of Pastry' (No rating, 1:24, in English and French) The veteran documentarians Chris Hegedus and D. A. Pennebaker tag along with several contenders for membership in the Meilleurs Ouvriers de France, an exclusive fraternity of pastry chefs. The film builds in interest and intrigue as it goes along, helped immeasurably by the choice of the astonishingly good-natured chef Jacquy Pfeiffer as their chief protagonist. The competition involves nerve-racking suspense and bittersweet resolution -- you'll be surprised by how devastating the collapse of a chocolate tower can be. (Hale)20100930
- 'Last Train Home' (No rating, 1:27, in Mandarin language and Sichuan dialect) Lixin Fan's wrenching and compassionate documentary examines a complex and overwhelming social phenomenon -- the role of migrant laborers in China's fast-changing economy -- from the standpoint of a family that is tested and fractured by globalization. (Scott)20100930
- 'Leaves of Grass' (R, 1:44) Edward Norton plays polar-opposite twins in this feisty, pot-filled tale from Tim Blake Nelson. One twin is a marijuana grower in Oklahoma; the other escaped those Oklahoma roots for the Ivy League. The Ivy Leaguer is drawn back home for what he thinks is his brother's funeral, and all heck breaks loose in a fusion of the funny and the violent. (Neil Genzlinger)20100930
'Legend of the Guardians: the Owls of Ga'Hoole' (PG, 1:30) Or (after Harry Potter's postal pet) ''Hedwig of the Rings.'' Zack Snyder, director of ''300,'' aims for younger males with this animated all-avian opus based on Kathryn Lasky's books. And it's a hoot, full of winged warriors in helmets and metal claws, swooping vengefully in slow-motion conflagration. Each feather, sunset and 3-D perspective is rendered impeccably, and the voice talent, much of it Australian, is top-notch. But a trite setup (and some retrograde female characterizations) keep it from soaring. (Webster)20100930
'Machete' (R, 1:45) The pace is swift, the tone playful, and the screenplay peppered with one-liners in the splatter comedy that takes on the immigration debate. Whether mowed down by gunfire or dispatched by sheaves of blades, the bodies pile up in split-second blasts of carnage. (Holden)20100930
'Mao's Last Dancer' (PG, 1:57) In Bruce Beresford's film, based on the true story of a Chinese dancer who was allowed to come to Houston to study in the early 1980s and subsequently defected, ballet and modern Chinese history are window dressing for what's essentially a deluxe old-fashioned tear-jerker. (Hale)20100930
- 'Mesrine: Killer Instinct' (Part 1) and 'Mesrine: Public Enemy No. 1' (Part 2) (R, 1:53 and 2:14, in French) ''Mesrine'' may not be a tragic gangster epic in the tradition of the ''The Godfather'' movies; it is too flighty and episodic. But it has a monumental lead performance by Vincent Cassel. He fuses the cobralike menace of the young Robert Mitchum with the whipsaw, shape-shifting volatility of classic Robert De Niro. (Holden)20100930
'Never Let Me Go' (R, 1:43) Mark Romanek directs this pretty, emotionally arid adaptation of the Kazuo Ishiguro novel, with Carey Mulligan, Andrew Garfield and Keira Knightley as three young people raised to become organ donators. (Dargis)20100930
'Resident Evil: Afterlife' (R, 1:30) More moribund than its thronging undead, this witless fourth installment in the video-game-derived saga of a comely zombie hunter (Milla Jovovich) spends most of its running time in a Los Angeles prison surrounded by hordes of pustular flesh-eaters. Assisted by helpful freeze-frames to allow us to admire the extra dimension, a small band of survivors fights off the infected and finally heads for the sewers. The script follows. (Catsoulis)20100930
- 'The Social Network' (PG-13, 2:00) David Fincher, working from Aaron Sorkin's script, directs a fleet, weirdly funny, exhilarating, alarming, fictionalized look at the boot-up, log-on, plug-in generation and the man (Jesse Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg) behind the social-media phenomenon Facebook. Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake co-star. (Dargis)20100930
'Takers' (PG-13, 1:47) A movie about guys who take stuff that is every bit as imaginative as its title. The clothes are nice, though, and there are some decent action sequences and performances (notably from Matt Dillon and Tip Harris, better known as the rapper T. I.). (Scott)20100930
'Tibet in Song' (No rating, 1:26, in English and Tibetan) In this stirring, dismaying documentary, Ngawang Choephel, a Tibetan musicologist, does more than just tell his own remarkable story of being imprisoned by the Chinese while he was trying to record Tibetan folk songs. He recaps Tibet's long struggle, paints a stark picture of China's efforts to erase Tibetan culture and introduces us to some courageous souls who have resisted the encroachments. (Genzlinger)20100930
'The Town' (R, 2:05) Ben Affleck directs and stars in this not-bad Boston crime thriller, with decent action, good performances -- notably Jon Hamm, Jeremy Renner and Blake Lively -- and some fine, if somewhat fetishized, local color. (Scott)20100930
- 'Waiting for ''Superman'' ' (PG, 1:42) Davis Guggenheim's powerful, alarming documentary about America's failing public schools is a call to arms to modify a system that he portrays as held hostage by teachers' unions. The potential saviors are reformers like Geoffrey Canada, founder of the Harlem Children's Zone. (Holden)20100930
'Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps' (PG-13, 2:13) Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) returns in Oliver Stone's unwieldy and entertaining attempt at a moral anatomy of the financial debacle of 2008. If Mr. Stone misses the chance to turn that event into great drama, he nonetheless turns it into a sweeping, racing and intermittently pithy show. Shia LeBeouf is Gekko's would-be son-in-law; Carey Mulligan is the rogue financier's estranged daughter; and Josh Brolin is a suave titan of the Street who very nearly out-Gekkos Gekko. (Scott)20100930
'Winter's Bone' (R, 1:40) Debra Granik's flinty Ozark noir follows a teenage girl's search for her missing father, an expert methamphetamine cooker who has fallen afoul of his own outlaw kin. Jennifer Lawrence's lead performance is flawless and helps to lift this film above at least some of the usual independent-movie assumptions about rural poverty in America. (Scott)20100930
'You Again' (PG, 1:40) There is not a laugh to be found in the rancid, misogynistic comedy about high-school mean girls and their victims. (Holden)20100930
'You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger' (R, 1:38) Sexual longing and metaphysical emptiness with an all-start cast in London, written and directed by -- no points for guessing right! -- Woody Allen. (Scott)20100930

HEADLINE: Candidate In Oakland Bucks Tide On Measure

BYLINE: By ZUSHA ELINSON. 
zelinson@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
Greg Harland, a retired businessman, acknowledged he was nervous before last week's debate for Oakland mayoral hopefuls.
That is because Mr. Harland -- a first-time candidate and a long shot who has raised almost no money -- was about to take an unpopular stance on marijuana in Oakland. 
He is against it.
''It's the third rail of Oakland politics, and I'm standing on it,'' Mr. Harland said after the debate. ''But the core of my campaign is trying to bring jobs here, and if I'm trying to encourage employers to come to Oakland, do they want to come to the cannabis capital of the country?''
As California considers a proposition to legalize marijuana for recreational use, Oakland has staked a good part of its economic future on the ability to use the drug to generate business and taxes that would benefit the strapped city.
At last week's debate, the other eight mayoral candidates -- who clashed all night over issues like police layoffs, the budget deficit and education -- all pledged their support to Measure V, a local ballot measure that would raise taxes on the city's thriving medical marijuana dispensaries and levy a 10-percent tax on marijuana sales if the drug becomes legal.
In a city that has been dubbed the Silicon Valley of cannabis, the leading mayoral candidates -- Don Perata, Jean Quan and Rebecca Kaplan --have all also endorsed Proposition 19, the statewide legalization measure.
''The powers-that-be have wholeheartedly embraced cannabis as something that can bring benefit to the whole city in terms of revenue, jobs and safety,'' said Stephen DeAngelo, executive director of Harborside Health Center in Oakland, which boasts 58,000 members, making it the largest medical marijuana dispensary in the world.
A Field poll released last week showed 49 percent of likely voters statewide support Proposition 19, with 42 percent opposed. The margin of sampling error was four percentage points.
But while opposing marijuana might be political suicide in Oakland, politicians seeking statewide office still appear reluctant to embrace the cause. Even Jerry Brown, the former mayor of Oakland, and Mayor Gavin Newsom of San Francisco, both Democrats, oppose Proposition 19.
Ruth Bernstein, a pollster with EMC Research in Oakland, said candidates like Mr. Newsom were trying to win votes in regions like the Central Valley, where Proposition 19 is polling lower. Fifty-nine percent of Central Valley voters opposed Proposition 19, while 30 percent supported it, according to the Field poll. In the Bay Area, those percentages were reversed.
Back in Oakland, Mr. Harland said he recognized that he had taken perhaps the most unpopular position he could take. Mr. Harland said he was not against adults' making their own choices, adding that once he even inhaled.
''I smoked pot way back about 1970 like all young kids,'' he said.
These days, he said, the ''only thing I have is the occasional glass of wine.''

HEADLINE: City Hall Opens Its Doors to Dance

BYLINE: By CHLOE VELTMAN. 
cveltman@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
Since being rebuilt in 1915, San Francisco City Hall has been the site of many dramatic scenes.
The Beaux-Arts building with its colossal, gold-embellished dome rising 307.5 feet -- the fifth-largest dome in the world -- has been the site of the assassinations of Mayor George Moscone and Harvey Milk, a city supervisor; the fire hosing of students protesting the House Un-American Activities Committee; the wedding of Joe DiMaggio and Marilyn Monroe, and the ongoing battle to legalize same-sex marriage.
Movie directors have also taken advantage of the building's majesty; the edifice has served as a backdrop for scenes in ''Raiders of the Lost Ark,'' ''Dirty Harry'' and many other notable movies. 
But despite the inherent theatricality of the building, public performing arts events inside its walls have been rare.
''It was a place where city business got done in rabbit warrens of back offices,'' said Kary Schulman, director of Grants for the Arts, the city's main cultural grant-giving body. ''Performing arts groups didn't look at it as a possible venue.''
But following the success in February of Erika Chong Shuch's dance theater work about gay marriage (''Love Everywhere''), City Hall and San Francisco Grants for the Arts have joined forces with Dancers' Group and World Arts West to create a new program of free, monthly lunchtime dance performances in City Hall. The Rotunda Dance Series kicks off Friday.
The series begins at noon with a 25-minute dance installation by Zaccho Dance Theater entitled ''Sailing Away.'' An excerpt from a larger site-specific work about the mass exodus of blacks from San Francisco in the 1850s, ''Sailing Away'' will be performed in full at different locations along Market Street from Oct. 7 to 10.
Over the next nine months, performances by the AXIS Dance Company, the Halau 'o Keikiali'i hula ensemble and other local groups will also grace City Hall. Organizers hope the program will introduce new audiences to dance, and help expand City Hall's relationship with the public.
''The art happenings will hopefully make people think of City Hall as being more than a place you go to deal with taxes or yell at a supervisor,'' said Wayne Hazzard, the executive director of Dancers' Group.
Presenting art at City Hall comes with challenges. Producers have to deal with limitations on the availability of the space for performance and rehearsal, rules against tampering with the architecture to install lights and sets and poor acoustics.
''So many technical things were tough,'' Ms. Shuch said about mounting ''Love Everywhere.'' ''We never ran through the piece until the actual show.''
Yet the physical beauty of City Hall makes it a lovely stage. And the pivotal role it has played over the years in the history of San Francisco creates a powerful resonance for artists interested in conveying political or social messages through their work.
''Sailing Away'' could make a particularly strong impact when presented within the confines of the city's seat of power.
''These were prominent figures in San Francisco history, but many of them have been forgotten,'' Joanna Haigood, the artistic director of Zaccho Dance Theater, said of the black figureheads portrayed in ''Sailing Away.'' ''Bringing these characters to City Hall provides a wonderful opportunity for audiences to view them within the political context of the city.''
Officials have not shied from presenting politically charged work. For example, the San Francisco Art Commission has held photography exhibitions on women in the global economy and oil companies dumping waste in South Africa in its downstairs gallery. And Matt Gonzalez, who presented monthly art shows at his City Hall office throughout his tenure as a city supervisor from 2001 to 2004, once allowed the graffiti artist Barry McGee to paint ''smash the state'' on his office walls.
''We meet no resistance whatsoever for mounting exhibitions that highlight issues that are important to the building,'' said Meg Shiffler, the director of the San Francisco Arts Commission Gallery.
But Ms. Shiffler said the programming at City Hall was still evolving. ''Someday I'd like to see Christo wrapping the dome and Diamanda Galas singing from the balcony,'' she said. ''The sky's the limit when you work for the city, but you have to move slowly and carefully to gain support to build the public programs you want.''

HEADLINE: Where Manual Labor Is the Price of Academic Excellence

BYLINE: By SCOTT JAMES. 
Scott James is an Emmy-winning television journalist and novelist who lives in San Francisco. sjames@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
Scott James is a columnist for The Bay Citizen.
For parents at Miraloma Elementary School in San Francisco, the quest for academic achievement means getting their hands dirty.
On a cold, foggy Wednesday morning recently, seven parents huddled around an outdoor table scrubbing stalks of organic celery for snack time. They had just finished cleaning and portioning a mound of Gala apples. Inside, three vacuum cleaners stood sentry in the hallway, at the ready for parents to tidy classroom carpets.
''You need to pick up where the state falls off,'' said Rossana Rossetto, the mother of a first grader. 
Welcome to the New Math of education: chores equal scores.
Parents are involved in nearly every level of school operations at Miraloma -- from academics to the grunt work of food preparation, gardening and cleaning.
The results could have parents in other schools grabbing mops and heading to classrooms: In a few years, Miraloma has gone from being one of the poorest performing and least desirable schools in the city to being one of the highest scoring on academic tests and the most coveted.
In 2005, Miraloma scored 651 out of 1000 on California's Academic Performance Index. Results released last week show a score of 865, among the city's best.
''There were 450 parent requests for 37 open kindergarten spots this year,'' said Ron Machado, the school's principal.
On a recent visit to one of the school's kindergarten classes, a half-dozen parents were assisting children alongside a teacher and one teacher's aide. Most parental involvement entailed learning, but the manual chores are indicative of how far families will go to help a school succeed.
The extra hands have also been important during the recession when public schools must cope with budget issues. Miraloma, with 362 students from kindergarten to fifth grade, employs two custodians and two kitchen workers for maintenance and meals. To get beyond those basics, parents work in the school's educational garden (complete with two chickens), prepare and provide organic snacks, and even do landscaping.
Ellie Rossiter, executive director of Parents for Public Schools, a nonprofit group that advocates for families in the school system, witnessed Miraloma's transition firsthand. ''Seven years ago when my child enrolled there, no one thought it was a good school,'' she said.
Ms. Rossiter and a dozen other parents credited the turnaround to the school's most recent principals, including Mr. Machado, a charming and creative former teacher who took charge five years ago. He once inspired students by promising to shave his hair into a Mohawk if test scores improved -- a photo of him with that resplendent pink hairdo is on the school's Web site.
''He makes it his job to make the family part of the school,'' Ms. Rossiter said.
Miraloma is just one example in San Francisco's public schools where parental involvement is having an impact. Standing at the celery-scrubbing table, parents easily rattled off the names of 10 other schools with high parental participation and correspondingly high test scores.
GreatSchools.org, a nonprofit organization that independently monitors school quality, recently ranked San Francisco as having the best public schools in California and No. 8 nationwide for cities with populations of 300,000 or more.
It is a ranking that defies conventional wisdom here. It is not unusual for San Francisco residents to bemoan the public schools -- a reputation that experts say has developed due to the city's complex system that requires parents to apply for schools, rather than to have their children attend whichever school is closest. Fears of ending up in a poor-performing school have unfairly tainted the whole system, experts say.
Matthew Hardy of the United Educators of San Francisco, the teachers' union, said that the belief that the public school system is a failure was ''one of those truths that isn't true.''
What is true, however, is that not all parents can donate their days. The schools that tend to have the most parental participation also have more middle-class families. Miraloma's success has come at a price: fewer children from working-class homes.
Still, there is a feeling that any school can improve if the parents get involved.
Monica McGee has had children at Miraloma for nearly a decade and remembers what failure looked like.
''Eight years ago there was no parental participation,'' Ms. McGee said. ''It was like a ghost town.''
Now, with grades soaring, pass the celery brush.

HEADLINE: San Francisco District Attorney Is Tireless in State Campaign

BYLINE: By GERRY SHIH. 
gshih@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- The lively gospel singing had barely died down at the First African Methodist Episcopal Church on Sunday when the 800-strong congregation welcomed to the pulpit Kamala D. Harris.
The room was warmed up, and so was Ms. Harris, the San Francisco district attorney, who had rushed to the church after addressing another congregation, of 2,000 people, just 20 minutes earlier.
As Ms. Harris, the Democratic nominee for state attorney general, entered the final stretch of what has become an uphill battle against Steve Cooley, a Republican who is the district attorney in Los Angeles, her strategists have sent her crisscrossing Southern California every weekend, feverishly courting black voters with a powerful personal story about her upbringing in the civil rights movement.
''The election is in 37 days,'' Ms. Harris told the congregation, her voice rising. ''You know, there was a time when folks said we couldn't vote, and others who said we won't, and we've got to prove them wrong.'' 
Party officials hope she can not only keep the attorney general's office in Democratic hands, but also drive enthusiasm and voter turnout that will help Jerry Brown and Gavin Newsom become governor and lieutenant governor, respectively.
''She's one of the most exciting parts of the ticket,'' said Eric Bauman, the vice chairman of the state Democratic Party and the chairman of the party in Los Angeles County.
Mr. Bauman called Ms. Harris's background -- she is the daughter of a black economist and an Indian biologist -- ''a blessing from God.''
''This is a county where the majority are people of color, and as they get our mail with her picture on it, they'll realize they can elect a woman of color to attorney general, something we've never done,'' Mr. Bauman said. ''I have every intention of taking full advantage of it.''
Ms. Harris, 45, has been considered a rising star in the Democratic Party ever since she became district attorney in 2002 with the backing of Willie L. Brown Jr., the former San Francisco mayor and longtime speaker of the Assembly.
In 2008 she laid the groundwork for a statewide race by being co-chairwoman of Barack Obama's California campaign and fund-raising extensively on his behalf in Southern California. After his victory, Ms. Harris began appearing on national television, with journalists like Gwen Ifill and Matt Lauer referring to her as the ''female Obama.''
To her supporters, running for California attorney general, an office that has never been occupied by a woman, was a logical next step. And it is lost on no one in political circles that since 1971, every attorney general of California has run for governor.
To Republicans, she seemed an obvious rising threat.
''When you looked at Kamala Harris, you would say, 'This is Barack Obama,' '' said Bill Whalen, the former speechwriter for Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican. ''This could potentially be the first woman governor of California -- and the first African-American governor.''
And yet, in the polls, Ms. Harris is trailing Mr. Cooley, a moderate Republican with bipartisan support here in California's most populous county.
Unlike Mr. Cooley, Ms. Harris opposes the death penalty, and she infuriated law enforcement groups when she declined to seek the death penalty for David Hill, who gunned down a San Francisco police officer in 2004.
Ms. Harris has also been hobbled in the past year by two scandals in San Francisco. One involved the theft of drug samples by a crime lab technician, which led to the dismissal of hundreds of drug cases and the shutdown of the lab. The second involved the failure of prosecutors to disclose the misconduct records of police officers who testified in court, as required by law.
Ms. Harris said in an interview that she accepted responsibility for the lab scandal as ''the chief elected law enforcement official'' in the city, but added, ''My opponent characterizes it as the D.A.'s crime lab when it is in fact the police department's crime lab.''
She also said she had put into effect a ''model'' policy on disclosure to defense attorneys of police officers' backgrounds.
Ms. Harris talked of being ''smart on crime.'' She promoted programs she has started that combat white-collar crime and complex mortgage fraud, environmental offenses and, above all, student truancy in San Francisco, which she said led to violent crime later in life.
Her plan to file criminal charges against parents who have chronically truant children has drawn criticism in San Francisco, with some groups arguing that it unfairly singles out working-class, minority parents. But before black audiences on the campaign trail, her emphasis on the value of education consistently draws approving murmurs, and she is able to cast aside criticisms of the truancy program as typical of liberal San Francisco.
While she wades deep into Cooley territory every weekend, her campaign has been sharply criticizing Mr. Cooley over the air, accusing him of accepting thousands of dollars of gifts during his tenure as Los Angeles district attorney. The Harris campaign has also sought to tar him with the public-official pay scandal in the city of Bell, which was exposed by The Los Angeles Times and has since led to multiple indictments.
Mr. Cooley dismissed the criticisms, saying it ''shows her level of desperation.''
His campaign manager, Kevin Spillane, added that Ms. Harris would be doomed once the Cooley campaign hit back with ads highlighting her failures in San Francisco.
Scandals aside, Ms. Harris's struggles also underscore a perennial Achilles heel for candidates from San Francisco seeking statewide office: Their opponents often portray the city's officials as extreme liberals unfit to govern the entire state.
But Ms. Harris, whose public presence in San Francisco is that of a coolly aloof criminal-justice wonk, is proving adept at recasting herself for California's widely diverse constituencies.
At the pulpit, the normally flinty prosecutor drops her final r's and g's. Her voice rises and falls; her cadence gains rhythm.
She has crafted a narrative of a career rooted in civil rights and justice. Her parents, she frequently tells her audiences, met as active members of the civil rights movement at the University of California, Berkeley, in the 1960s.
''Among my heroes in my education were the architects of the civil rights movement, and they were, of course, the lawyers,'' Ms. Harris said. ''They were Thurgood Marshall, and Charles Hamilton Houston and Constance Baker Motley, who used the skill of this great profession to translate the passion of the streets to the courtrooms of our country.''
And at every stop, she trumpets her affinity for her alma mater, Howard University, which is always a crowd-pleaser.
Her weekly stumping has taken her from the cavernous evangelical megachurches to the most storied black pulpits. It has also taken her to the edge of the desert, where the N.A.A.C.P. of San Bernardino hosted a town-hall-style meeting for her on a recent Saturday.
After Ms. Harris was whisked back to Los Angeles for yet another fund-raiser, Waudieur Rucker-Hughes remained behind in the emptying room, picking through a fruit salad while digesting Ms. Harris's talk.
''She grew up in civil rights. I didn't know that about her,'' Ms. Rucker-Hughes said. ''I'm going to get up in church tomorrow and talk about her. I'm going to spread the word.''

HEADLINE: New Models and Light Trucks Help September Sales for Automakers

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC and NICK BUNKLEY

 BODY:
DETROIT -- Automakers reported solid if unspectacular sales in September, as manufacturers with the freshest products drew the most attention from American consumers.
Overall sales for September increased 28.5 percent from a year ago, when sales tumbled in the aftermath of the cash-for-clunkers rebate program. Last month's increase slightly exceeded expectations and raised hopes that the industry would continue its long, slow comeback from 2009, when sales hit their lowest levels in 25 years.
Pickups and other light trucks outsold smaller and more fuel-efficient passenger cars for the first time since February 2009. Truck sales rose 41 percent; car sales were up 18 percent. 
The Ford Motor Company once again posted strong results with a 46 percent increase. Ford, which has replaced many of its most popular products with newer models, said its market share improved for the 23rd month in the last 24. The company's gain has been tied closely to those new models, including the recently introduced Ford Fiesta subcompact car.
''Ford has a solid lead on Toyota and should regain the No. 2 spot for annual sales, which it hasn't held since 2007,'' said Ivan Drury, an analyst for the auto research Web site Edmunds.com.
Toyota, which has struggled because of quality concerns and safety recalls, rebounded in September with a 17 percent gain over the same period a year ago.
General Motors, the nation's biggest automaker, said that its sales climbed 11.5 percent in the month, but that the four brands it still operates -- Chevrolet, Buick, Cadillac and GMC -- had a 22 percent increase.
G.M. has closed three brands and sold off a fourth since it emerged last year from its government-sponsored bankruptcy. The company is gaining some traction in the marketplace from its newest products, including the Buick Regal sedan, which has been on the market for a couple of months. Other new models are just getting released -- last month, G.M. sold 516 Chevrolet Cruzes, a model just starting to come off the production line in Ohio.
G.M. also reported strong sales of its full-size pickups, an indication that the construction-related businesses were healthier and beginning to spend again. For the month, sales of the Chevrolet Silverado increased 66 percent and the GMC Sierra rose 52 percent.
''We view our performance in September as further evidence that our plan for the U.S. market is well balanced, and it continues to pay dividends in what is a very challenging economy and a competitive market,'' said Don Johnson, G.M.'s vice president for United States sales operations.
The biggest surprise in last month's figures came from Chrysler, which has struggled since its government bailout and bankruptcy reorganization.
Sales of Chrysler's sport utility vehicles benefited from stable gas prices. Its newest product, the redesigned Jeep Grand Cherokee, helped push an overall increase of 61 percent in September. Chrysler outsold Honda by more than 2,000 vehicles, jumping into fourth place for the month, behind Toyota.
''New product is even more important now than any other time,'' said Jesse Toprak, vice president for industry trends and insights for TrueCar.com, which tracks vehicle sales and prices. ''Most consumers have been in a holding pattern, waiting for a reason to buy a car. A new car that is dramatically improved over the version that consumers already own may be a reason for them to go to dealerships today.''
But showrooms remain considerably less crowded than before the recession, as unemployment and shaky consumer confidence deter car shopping. ''Consumers are still sending us a very clear message that they will continue to be cautious with their spending,'' Mr. Johnson of G.M. said.
The industry's seasonally adjusted annualized selling rate, a closely watched measure of demand, was 11.76 million in September, the highest level this year. The rate was 9.38 million a year ago.
Mr. Toprak said he expected the selling rate in the fourth quarter to be at least as high as September's, possibly even reaching 12 million.
But relatively slow sales in the first half of the year mean total sales for the industry in 2010 are expected to be around 11.5 million. That compares with 10.4 million in 2009 and more than 17 million in 2005. The popularity of new models should bode well for the Detroit automakers and for import brands like Hyundai, all of which plan to make numerous introductions in the months ahead.
Ken Czubay, Ford's vice president for United States marketing, sales and service, said the Fiesta had largely taken business away from rivals rather than from other Ford models.
''Many of the customers have never shopped at a Ford dealership before,'' Mr. Czubay said.

HEADLINE: Lone Sale of $4.1 Billion in Contracts Led to 'Flash Crash' in May

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY

 BODY:
It was a stock market mystery that had everyone guessing for months: just what caused that harrowing flash crash last May?
On Friday, after months of investigation and speculation, federal authorities finally provided the answer: it all began with the click of a computer mouse in Kansas.
In a long-awaited report on one of wildest days in Wall Street's history, regulators said that the automated sale of a large block of futures by a mutual fund -- not named in the report, but identified by officials as Waddell & Reed Financial, of Overland Park, Kan. -- touched off a chain reaction of events on May 6. The Dow Jones industrial average plunged more than 600 points in a matter of minutes that day and then recovered in a blink.
The finger-pointing and speculation that followed -- Were high-speed traders behind it? A rogue computer program? Financial terrorists? -- captivated Wall Street. But in the report released on Friday, the authorities said they found no evidence of market manipulation. Instead, the temporary crash resulted from a confluence of forces after a single fund company tried to hedge its stock market investment position legitimately, albeit in an aggressive and abrupt manner. 
The mutual fund started a program at about 2:32 p.m. on May 6 to sell $4.1 billion of futures contracts, using a computer sell algorithm that over the next 20 minutes dumped 75,000 contracts onto the market, even automatically accelerating its selling as prices plunged.
The regulators hope the report lifts the uncertainty that has hung over the nation's exchanges -- and investors' minds -- since the crash. Certainly, officials at the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission seemed confident they had established the causes of the crash and answered any final doubts, and the findings were welcomed by some in the markets.
But it also left lingering questions among many who felt it did not explain why the crash took place on that particular day in May, or provide any assurance that this could not occur again.
''Extreme volatility of the kind we experienced on May 6 could happen again,'' said Representative Paul E. Kanjorski, Democrat of Pennsylvania, in a statement.
The regulators had already identified in a previous report the single large sale of futures contracts as having played an important role in the May 6 plunge. But in the new findings published Friday, the regulators emphasized the central role this large sale played on a day when markets were already under pressure because of the debt crisis in Greece.
''This report identifies what happened and reaffirms the importance of a number of the actions we have taken since that day,'' Mary L. Schapiro, the S.E.C. chairman, and Gary Gensler, the chairman of the C.F.T.C., said in a statement.
''We now must consider what other investor-focused measures are needed to ensure that our markets are fair, efficient and resilient, now and for years to come,'' they said.
The report set out the sequence of events that began with the sale by Waddell & Reed of 75,000 E-Mini Standard & Poor's 500 futures contracts, using computer sell algorithms. Normally, a sale of this size would take place over as many as five hours, but the large sale was executed in 20 minutes, the regulators said.
The algorithm was programmed to execute the trade ''without regard to price or time,'' the report said, which meant that it continued to sell even as prices dropped sharply.
The algorithm is one used widely across markets. It was provided to the firm by Barclays Capital, but it was up to Waddell & Reed to set the parameters dictating the way it sold the futures contracts.
There was no explanation from officials why the firm chose to sell so many contracts all at once, except to speculate that it was already late in the trading day when it made the sale. Neither would officials explicitly say whether or not the firm was under investigation, but they pointed out that the firm had made similar trades in the past.
In response to Friday's report, Waddell & Reed put out a statement it had already issued in May. It said it had sold the contracts because it was worried about the European crisis spreading to United States.
After the firm started to sell, the report found, many of the contracts were bought by high-frequency traders, computerized traders who buy and sell at high speed and account for a big part of trading in today's markets.
As they detected that they had amassed excessive ''long'' positions, they began to sell aggressively, which caused the mutual fund's algorithm in turn to accelerate its selling.
Startlingly, as the computers of the high-frequency traders traded contracts back and forth, a ''hot potato'' effect was created, the report said, as contracts changed hands 27,000 times in 14 seconds, but with eventually only 200 actually being bought or sold.
The selling pressure was then transferred from the futures markets to the stock market by arbitrageurs who started to buy the cheap futures contracts but sell cash shares on markets like the New York Stock Exchange.
Automatic computerized traders on the stock market shut down as they detected the sharp rise in buying and selling. Altogether, this led to the abrupt drop in prices of individual stocks and other financial instruments like exchange-traded funds, and caused shares of some prominent companies like Procter & Gamble and Accenture to trade down as low as a penny or as high as $100,000.
The rout continued until an automatic stabilizer on the futures exchange cut in and paused trading for five seconds, after which the markets recovered.
The report's findings will be put to a joint S.E.C.-C.F.T.C .advisory committee, which will determine if any new policies are needed.
Following the preliminary report in May, the S.E.C. announced it was instituting circuit breakers on all the stocks in the S.& P. 500-stock index, in an effort to prevent another crash.
It has since expanded the circuit breakers -- which halt trading in a stock for five minutes if the price moves by 10 percent or more in a five-minute period -- to a broader range of stocks.
In addition, Ms. Schapiro has said she wants to look at the use of stub quotes and also possibly limits on the speed of high-frequency trading, but some analysts said they still had questions.
''They didn't explain why it never happened before and if it is unlikely to happen in the future,'' said Adam Sussman, director of research at the Tabb Group. ''In that, it is disappointing.''

HEADLINE: Good Job Offer, but What About the House?

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
GIVEN the high unemployment rate, a job offer would seem a sign of great fortune. But it's not that simple if the offer means relocating.
While choosing between the prospect of exciting new work and uprooting a family has long been part of the calculus of a job change, the current economic slump is complicating the process.
Specifically, the problem is the house, that once great sign of American success. It is not easy to sell these days and worth a lot less than it used to be.
The difficulty in selling a home has prompted many people to second-guess a move -- and the job offer that precipitated it. Is the job really worth it? What if the job goes away in a year? What happens then? 
Jim Carpenter, managing partner at J. Carpenter & Company, a recruiting firm based in Darien, Conn., said he recently had a candidate who would not move to another city for a job even though he was unemployed and had limited prospects where he was.
He said he had another candidate in the mid-Atlantic states who was hesitant about taking a job in New England. ''It's hard for the husband to look his wife and children in the eye and say, 'We're making this move but our house is going to be 30 percent smaller,' '' said Mr. Carpenter, who has done high-level searches for Unilever, Digitas and Black & Decker.
With unemployment still high, many Americans would love to have the luxury of a job offer. Still, for people whose careers are still chugging along, the home can be a problem.
So how do you address it? What options do you have in a bad housing market? The options vary from not great to pretty astonishing given the economy.
STAYING PUT There are risks to moving but there are obviously financial risks to staying put, even if your current job is a good one. For one, that job could go away.
John Archer, managing director of Catalyst Advisors, which specializes in recruiting for health care companies, said the dislocations of the last three years have left many people opposed to employment elsewhere.
Their house, in a sense, is a good excuse to stay put. Beyond the costs of selling it in a bad market, there are the challenges of uprooting their family.
Yet Mr. Archer said ambitious executives are just as game as ever to make a move. ''If you look at the macro discussion, the American economy is slowing down,'' he said. ''If someone is blocked in their current role, they could be looking several years out to a promotion. So looking at a new opportunity could be a motivator.''
And that may mean taking a loss on the house but being happy to have a new opportunity.
RENTING Still, the insecurity in the housing and job markets has been a boon to people who want to rent before committing to a new area (or selling in an old one).
Kimberly Smith, chief executive of Avenue West Corporate Housing and CorporateHousingByOwner.com, said she recently worked with an executive at Kaiser Permanente who was asked to relocate from the East Coast to San Francisco. Even though it was a promotion, the executive was wary of selling his home and just as uneasy about buying something in his new city. So he rented in both places.
This is becoming more common, she said. In a recent study of the corporate rental industry conducted by her firm, only 56 percent of respondents considered themselves long-term investors. The remaining 44 percent are what Ms. Smith calls ''accidental landlords,'' pressed into the role by the realities of the housing market.
That was the case with Anna and Noah Crossley. In 2007, she bought a condominium in Nashville, and two years later the two got married. Then, Mr. Crossley, a classically trained trombonist, received a fellowship that required them to move to Kansas City, Kan.
When they went to sell their condo, though, they found out that they literally could not: the developer of the project had never gotten proper Federal Housing Association approval, which meant that the buyer would have to come up with the entire price in cash because no bank would make a loan. They also failed to find a traditional renter. So, in the end, they listed it fully furnished on CorporateHousingByOwner .com.
Since June 2009, Ms. Crossley said there had been only one month in which the condo was not rented. ''We clear our mortgage and utilities, so it's wash,'' she said. ''But we rent here and it would be very tight if we had to pay that mortgage as well.''
Some of the people renting out their homes are out-of-work executives who are now living someplace less expensive. It is a difficult option, but it has been a way for some to keep their home from dragging them under while they search for a new job.
This is what Stuart Cave, who lost his job in technology sales a year ago, has done. ''I hadn't factored in a perfect storm of real estate and rental prices falling and being unemployed for a substantial amount of time,'' said Mr. Cave, who owns a condo in Hoboken, N.J., with views of New York. ''I did this as an interim step so I don't have to blow through a whole lot more of my savings.''
For most of these people, renting out their homes is a short-term solution. Ms. Smith, whose Web site charges $279 for a one-year listing, said the Kaiser executive decided he liked San Francisco and bought a home, moving his furniture out with him. He is still renting out his home on the East Coast, but that was more a reflection of the soft housing market than fears about his new job.
NEGOTIATING The reality is companies that really want someone are still putting together perk-filled relocation packages. And for certain executives, those perks have actually become sweeter, which may seem counterintuitive given the high unemployment rate.
But for many companies, this is a good business decision.
''If you're moving a guy who's making $300,000 a year and has a $600,000 house, you can't say, 'You've got to sit on that,' '' Mr. Carpenter said. ''It's an enormous distraction to the guy and his family that he can't sell his house and buy a new one.''
So if you are one of those lucky people, what can you expect? Well, if your $2 million house is down $600,000 in value, no company is going to cover that loss, but, recruiters said, you may be able to get your new employer to chip in $100,000.
For an even more fortunate few, companies may still buy your house. This practice is rare, given how many companies did this during the boom and got stuck holding houses that have plummeted in value. But Mr. Carpenter said he had seen companies use third-party relocation companies to buy the homes of senior executives.
The era of gaming the appraisal market has come to an end, though. Mr. Archer said there was a time when a company would ask you for three estimates and pay the lowest one. But executives got to pick the appraisers, and many of the values were inflated. ''All of that has dissipated,'' Mr. Archer said.
There is a third option that is somewhere in between. Companies are willing to help executives cover the rent on an apartment in a new city, with the expectation that they will commute there during the week. This is certainly not ideal, but it is a job.

HEADLINE: The Campaign Disconnect

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
One in five American kids was living in poverty in 2009. Across the country, once solidly middle-class families are lining up at food pantries and soup kitchens for groceries or a hot meal. In New York City, a startling indicator of the continuing economic stress is the rise in the number of homes that don't have kitchens.
Election Day is approaching, but neither party cares to focus on the nightmare facing millions of Americans who have been laid low by unemployment, home foreclosures, personal bankruptcies, and jobs that offer only part-time work, lousy pay and absolutely no benefits. 
In an era of extreme economic inequality (which is another way of saying economic unfairness), Wall Street can be on a roll and corporate profits can streak toward the moon at the same time that ordinary American families are stuck in depressionlike conditions with precious little hope of relief.
The Democrats are trying to put the best possible face on this terrible economic reality, imploring voters to give them a little credit for preventing matters from becoming much worse. No matter how valid, that's a tough case to make to families whose properties are being plastered with foreclosure notices. Or to the breadwinners whose 99 weeks of unemployment insurance have been exhausted without anything in the way of a decent job materializing. Or the former middle managers now working for peanuts at Home Depot or Wal-Mart.
But at least the Democrats are still rooted in the real world. The Republicans, when they aren't behaving as though they've lost their minds completely (see O'Donnell, Angle, Paladino, et al.), are peddling a fantasy that has already damaged the country profoundly. The party's ludicrous ''Pledge to America'' promises to reduce federal budget deficits while, among other things, making all of the Bush-era tax cuts permanent and jacking up already insanely high defense costs.
The pledge is as dangerous as it is transparent. Economists have calculated that the tax cuts alone will cost nearly $4 trillion over the next decade.
These are the very same G.O.P. operatives who have spent years frantically looting the U.S. Treasury on behalf of their corporate masters, and they can't wait to get another crack at it. As John Boehner, one of the ring leaders, put it: ''We are not going to be any different than what we've been.''
What is especially weird is that while they are pushing plans guaranteed to increase budget deficits, the G.O.P. is united in opposition to investments in the economy that would put Americans back to work, revitalize sagging industries and eventually provide the taxes that are crucial to actually getting a handle on deficits.
Weirder still is that even Democrats who should know better are buying into this self-defeating austerity posture. More than 300 economists, including Robert Reich, the former labor secretary, have signed onto a public statement urging policy makers not to undercut any real chance at a recovery by focusing prematurely on deficit reduction. What are needed instead are prudent, sensible investments, especially in infrastructure, research and development, and green energy initiatives.
The statement, released by the liberal Institute for America's Future, noted that President Obama's National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform would like to reduce the federal deficit to 3 percent of the gross domestic product by 2015. That's not realistic. It's not going to happen.
More important is the following point made by the institute in its statement:
''At the end of World War II, the U.S. was burdened with debt that totaled over 120 percent of G.D.P. But we made the investments vital to a new economy -- the G.I. Bill, housing subsidies, the interstate highway system, the conversion of military plants, and the Marshall plan. We ran annual deficits over most of the next three decades and the debt grew in absolute size, but the economy and the broad middle class grew faster. By 1980, the debt had been reduced to barely 30 percent of G.D.P.''
There is no doubt that the country, starved for revenues and still at war, will have to increase some taxes. Unnecessary spending should be attacked. But the nation is still in the throes of an economic crisis. Poverty is growing and the middle class is shrinking, and more than 20 million Americans are out of work or underemployed.
We can pretend that all of this is not happening and that there won't be grave consequences as a result. We can cling to the Ronald Reagan-George W. Bush fairy tale that handing over ever more riches to those who are already rich and powerful is the way to revitalize the American dream.
Or we can take our cue from the best moments in American history, when the nation rolled up its sleeves and placed the interests of ordinary people at the top of its agenda.

HEADLINE: VW Intends to Be No. 1 by 2018, Doing to Toyota What Toyota Did to G.M.

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY and JACK EWING

 BODY:
PARIS -- No sooner had Volkswagen used the Paris Motor Show to flaunt its control over sports carmaker Porsche at a press event this week than Ferdinand Piech, the VW chairman, was already musing about the next high-end brand on his wish list: Alfa-Romeo.
The Fiat chief executive, Sergio Marchionne, immediately spurned the advance, saying that the Italian maker of stylish sedans and compacts, a Fiat subsidiary, was not for sale. But Mr. Piech's public offer for Alfa-Romeo was just the latest proof that top managers of Volkswagen, based in Wolfsburg, Germany, are serious when they say they want to be the world's largest automaker.
It was only two years ago that Toyota Motor stole the title of world's biggest from General Motors, which had held it since overtaking Ford in 1931. Volkswagen, which is now No.2 or No.3 depending on how you count it and G.M.'s respective joint ventures and stakeholdings, is determined to overtake Toyota much more quickly -- by 2018. 
Volkswagen is much stronger than Toyota in emerging markets, particularly China, where it is the largest foreign automaker and which has far surpassed Germany as the company's largest market. That has paid off for the German company this year as many mature markets stagnate or shrink after the end of government cash-for-clunkers measures.
To be sure, the talk of being No.1 is partly showmanship on the part of Mr. Piech and his longtime protege, Martin Winterkorn, Volkswagen's chief executive. In Paris, Volkswagen lived up to its reputation for especially bombastic auto show events, introducing its new Passat and other new models at an event that resembled a television variety show, including dancers and a turbocharged soundtrack.
The plan to overthrow Toyota also helps give VW's 377,000 employees a common goal.
''The target of becoming No.1 has had a tremendous motivational effect on the whole organization,'' said Christoph Sturmer, a director at IHS Automotive in Frankfurt, a market research firm.
But there is also a rationale behind the emphasis on size and volume. Volkswagen already makes almost two-thirds of its car models on just three platforms, or collections of key components like transmissions, electronics or axle assemblies, according to IHS. That allows VW to hold down the cost of components and also get maximum mileage out of the work that went into designing them.
''The biggest in the ring is also more likely, from a theoretical point of view, to have the biggest growth rate,'' Mr. Sturmer said.
To achieve the goal, Volkswagen must overcome some weaknesses, notably in the United States, where it sells fewer cars than even in Brazil. And there is also a risk that too much emphasis on volume could come at the expense of profit. Toyota managers have said that earning a good margin is more important to them than the bragging rights of being No.1.
Volkswagen, long the largest carmaker in Europe, is not exactly a David to Toyota's Goliath. In fact, the German company is having a stellar 2010, compared with a year Toyota might want to forget. While Mr. Winterkorn acknowledged that economic conditions remained uncertain, from Volkswagen's point of view, he declared in Paris, ''I have no hesitation in saying: The signs for the automobile industry are once again looking good.''
Mr. Winterkorn, who ranked VW third, behind G.M., said the German company was ''on the path toward becoming number one in the automobile industry.'' VW's 2010 sales through August were 4.7 million vehicles, up 13.4 percent from the period last year. In the first half of 2010 VW nearly tripled its net profit to 1.8 billion, or $2.5 billion.
Toyota, in contrast, has not had a year to brag about, with the recall of about 11 million vehicles worldwide since November, about 8 million of them in connection with complaints about sudden acceleration. Its sales rose 37 percent through August, to 5.7 million cars.
In another sign of Volkswagen's ambition: Mr. Piech joked in Paris that ''13 is my lucky number,'' a reference to the number of brands he thinks the company should own.
Considering that the company stable will only reach 10 brands when Porsche is fully absorbed next year, Mr. Piech's statement suggests he has his sights on three more. Last year at the Frankfurt Motor Show he told journalists that ''12 is a good number.''
The company's lineup includes midrange VW, Skoda, and Seat brand cars, which are ubiquitous in Europe, but also Scania trucks and Audi, which has overtaken BMW in the market for premium cars in Europe.
Volkswagen also boasts the superluxury brands Lamborghini, Bentley and Bugatti, which sell for hundreds of thousands of euros or in some cases more than 1 million.
The company is in the process of acquiring Porsche, with which Volkswagen has long cooperated. Mr. Piech's grandfather, Ferdinand Porsche, designed the iconic Beetle. The Paris Motor Show was the public debut of Matthias Muller, a VW lifer who officially became chief executive of Porsche on Friday.
Mr. Piech, who is known as a hands-on supervisory board chairman, and Mr. Winterkorn face little pressure from outside stockholders as they try to pass Toyota. Less than 10 percent of VW voting shares are traded publicly. The rest belong to the Porsche family, of which Mr. Piech is a member; the German state of Lower Saxony, whose prime concern is preserving jobs; and Qatar Holding, the sovereign wealth fund of the Emirate of Qatar.
Analysts give Volkswagen high grades for the way it has been able to share development costs and parts among its brands, while maintaining separate identities. The most successful example is probably Audi, whose cars use many of the same parts as lower-priced Volkswagen-brand cars but sell for thousands more.
Audi is Volkswagen's most profitable unit, accounting for 1.33 billion of the total of 2.84 billion in profit that the company earned in the first half.
''Strategy 2018,'' as VW styles its plan for market dominance, calls for the company to be the world's top employer and to rank first in customer satisfaction by that year. It also targets annual sales of more than 10 million vehicles and a pretax profit margin above 8 percent.
But VW also has weaknesses. Its Bentley unit, which competes with BMW's Rolls-Royce unit, lost money in the first half, as did the Seat unit based in Spain, which produces lower-priced cars.
In particular, Volkswagen is a secondary player in the United States, where it sold about 175,000 vehicles in the first half of 2010, less than a fifth as many as in China. Volkswagen is making a major push into the United States, though, building a factory in Chattanooga, Tennessee, which beginning next year will produce a new model designed for the American market. The company says its goal is to increase VW and Audi sales in the United States to 800,000 a year by 2018.
''VW is becoming a very strong contender globally,'' said Finbarr O'Neill, president of the U.S. market research firm J.D. Power. ''When they grow the business in North America they're going to be a formidable competitor for everyone.''
Volkswagen unit sales in the United States increased 29 percent in the first half, but analysts point out that the company still has a long way to go to catch up with the major automakers. Toyota sold more than two million cars there in the fiscal year ended March 31.
Still, Toyota could be vulnerable. The dollar -- the currency in which most of Toyota's revenue is booked -- has fallen about 10 percent against the yen this year, putting pressure on its profit when it repatriates foreign earnings.
Moreover, last year VW took a 19.9 percent capital stake in Suzuki Motor, which has more than a 50 percent share of the Indian market. If Suzuki fully joins the VW empire in the next few years, VW would then become the biggest automaker. Its sales combined with Suzuki's already outnumber Toyota's.
Jack Ewing reported from Frankfurt. Hiroko Tabuchi contributed reporting from Tokyo.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: 3rd Lender Will Freeze Foreclosures In the Courts

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD

 BODY:
Bank of America, the country's largest mortgage lender by assets, said on Friday that it was reviewing documents in all foreclosure cases now in court to evaluate if there were errors.
It is the third major lender in the last two weeks to freeze foreclosures in the 23 states where the process is controlled by courts.
But Bank of America went further than the first two lenders, GMAC Mortgage and JPMorgan Chase, which have said they will amend paperwork only in cases they think were improperly done. So far, that has amounted to only a handful of cases. 
Bank of America, in an e-mailed statement, said it would ''amend all affidavits in foreclosure cases that have not yet gone to judgment.''
That could mean tens of thousands of foreclosure cases would be in limbo for months or, if the consumers in default hire lawyers, years.
Spokesmen for the bank said that they were uncertain how many cases the lender currently had in court. They provided no timeline or explanation for the freeze, saying only that the bank planned to eventually resubmit all the cases.
The moratorium is likely to further fuel the uproar over the foreclosure tactics of the big lenders, which continued to have political ramifications on Friday.
Before Bank of America's announcement, Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut attorney general, asked judges in his state to put a halt to all foreclosures for 60 days. Connecticut is one of the 23 states where foreclosure is a judicial matter. Others include Illinois, Florida, New Jersey and New York.
Mr. Blumenthal, who is running for senator in Connecticut, said the freeze ''should stop a foreclosure steamroller based on defective documents and enable effective remedies.''
California's attorney general, Jerry Brown, said that Chase should stop any foreclosures in the state until it proved that it was following the law. Mr. Brown, who is a candidate for governor, earlier made the same demand of GMAC.
In California, lenders generally pursue foreclosures outside of the court system, so they are presumably still proceeding with evictions. Chase declined to say whether it would comply with Mr. Brown's comments.
Chase said this week that it had frozen 56,000 foreclosure cases. GMAC, which is largely owned by the Treasury after receiving $17 billion in federal bailout money to prevent its collapse, has repeatedly declined to say how many cases it is halting.
The nation's two other major lenders, Citi and Wells Fargo, have issued statements maintaining they have no problems with their cases.
The problem for all the lenders that have announced moratoriums stems directly from their attempt to deal with an unprecedented number of foreclosures.
According to LPS Applied Analytics, a mortgage data firm, 2 million households are in foreclosure. Another 2.37 million households are seriously delinquent and waiting for their lender to take action.
Sometimes these loans are still owned by the lender but often, the banks are merely the loan servicer acting on behalf of the owner. Many of the loans are owned by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage holding companies now controlled by the Treasury. In other cases the loans have been sold to private investment pools.
Confronted with so many cases, the lenders tried to process them on a wholesale basis, with the goal of avoiding the expense of a full trial and instead getting summary judgments.
The tool for doing this was the so-called robo-signers, in which midlevel bank executives would sign thousands of affidavits a month attesting that they had personal knowledge that the facts of the case were as presented. The affidavits were prepared by lawyers who were paid a flat fee, which also placed a premium on volume.
When defense lawyers started deposing these robo-signers, they acknowledged that they could not possibly have knowledge of all the cases. The banks say this is a technicality and they will refile the proper affidavits. The defense lawyers say the practice calls the cases, and indeed the entire process, into question.
Thomas Lawler, a housing economist, said the current mess was predictable and probably inevitable. Lenders made their money by making loans and then simply and efficiently servicing them by collecting the checks every month. They were never prepared to deal with the labor-intensive problems of delinquency and foreclosure.
''However, the foreclosure crisis is now almost three years old, and not having staffed up sufficiently to deal with the problems with inadequate staffing borders on criminal,'' Mr. Lawler said. ''I mean, jeepers, look at the unemployment rate; how hard would it have been to hire more folks?''
Mark Stopa, a Florida lawyer who represents defaulting homeowners, said the magnitude of the current troubles depends on how title insurance companies react. If those firms begin to shy away from insuring foreclosed properties because they think those properties are vulnerable to claims, he said, the entire housing market could suffer.
''Judges have to force banks to do foreclosures correctly,'' Mr. Stopa said. But he noted that would require a significant increase in staff. ''I'll believe it when I see it,'' he said.
Stocks of the major title insurance companies dropped on Friday amid concern that their business would suffer as a result of the foreclosure freezes. Fidelity National Financial fell more than 4 percent, while First American Financial dropped 3 percent.
One firm, Old Republic National Title, said this week it would not issue policies on GMAC foreclosures until further notice.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Way Ahead of Paladino in Cash, for Now

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

 BODY:
Andrew M. Cuomo will enter the final month of the race for governor of New York with $19 million on hand, according to figures his campaign released on Friday night, far more than the $209,406 his Republican opponent, Carl P. Paladino, reported having. 
That advantage is not as meaningful as it might seem, given Mr. Paladino's personal wealth and his promise to spend as much as $10 million of his own money on the campaign.
Without a significant investment of his own or a major influx of cash from contributors, Mr. Paladino would find himself severely outgunned as he seeks to overtake Mr. Cuomo, the state's attorney general.
Mr. Cuomo, who faced no Democratic primary opponent, said he had taken in $3.4 million since July, the last time his campaign was required to file a fund-raising report, and had spent $7.2 million.
Mr. Cuomo's campaign declined to release the full campaign filing on Friday night, and it was not immediately available from the State Board of Elections, leaving it unclear how Mr. Cuomo had spent the money or what debts were on his campaign balance sheet.
But according to figures from the Campaign Media Analysis Group, which tracks advertising spending, Mr. Cuomo's campaign had spent about $2.8 million on advertising in the last two weeks, while the state Democratic Party had spent close to half a million dollars on its own.
About $1.2 million of Mr. Cuomo's spending was devoted to a statewide television advertisement attacking Mr. Paladino, a Buffalo businessman who made millions in real estate, for his donations to Albany politicians and for what it called his failure to create jobs after winning tax breaks intended to promote economic development.
Mr. Paladino, who won the Republican primary against Rick A. Lazio, a former congressman from Long Island, raised $274,368 in the last week. The total included small contributions from dozens of individuals in upstate New York and donations from construction and real estate companies.
In the race for attorney general, the Democratic nominee, State Senator Eric T. Schneiderman, who won a five-way primary on Sept. 14, reported raising $312,351 in the last week and had about $1 million on hand. His Republican opponent, Daniel M. Donovan Jr., the Staten Island district attorney, who faced no primary opposition and has the backing of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, has raised $413,791 since July, when he last filed a campaign report. He had $444,621 on hand.
Mr. Bloomberg will host a fund-raiser for Mr. Donovan this month featuring Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey.
''Sometimes numbers speak louder than words,'' said James Freedland, a spokesman for Mr. Schneiderman. ''These numbers barely register a whisper.''
Virginia Lam, a spokeswoman for Mr. Donovan, said: ''This campaign started on Sept. 15, and despite Team Schneiderman's victory lap, our fund-raising in the past two weeks has been nearly even.''
In the race for state comptroller, the Democratic incumbent, Thomas P. DiNapoli, has raised $364,607 since July, has spent $752,486 and is entering the final month of the campaign with $1.4 million in the bank.
His Republican opponent, Harry Wilson, raised $1,209,231 -- including a $500,000 loan to himself -- and spent $1.3 million, and he is entering the final month with $2.6 million on hand.

HEADLINE: Comic-Con Extends Its San Diego Residency

BYLINE: By DAVE ITZKOFF

 BODY:
Moviegoers seeking early looks at Hollywood's latest action and science-fiction franchise films or just a place to dress as their favorite member of the X-Men can continue to look forward to gathering in San Diego each summer. Comic-Con International, the collectibles convention that has grown into an annual must-attend event for the makers and consumers of fantasy entertainment and pop culture, said on Friday that it would remain in San Diego through 2015, The San Diego Union Tribune reported. 
The convention, which drew 300 attendees when it started in 1970 and now attracts more than 130,000 people to the city and $163 million to the local economy each year, was set to have its contract with the San Diego Convention Center expire in 2012. Tourism officials in Anaheim and Los Angeles had been trying to steer the convention to their cities, amid concerns that it had outgrown the San Diego Convention Center and that local hotels were inflating their rates during their event. The Union Tribune said 64 San Diego hotels in the vicinity of the convention center had committed to discounted rates through 2015, and convention organizers were persuaded to remain in the city without the use of adamantium claws or optic blasts.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Remarks by Fed Officials Give Wall Street a Lift

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
Shares on Wall Street rose on Friday as Federal Reserve officials continued to suggest that they would undertake further monetary easing.
The major indexes began the fourth quarter on a positive note after economic reports showed that personal income, consumer sentiment and manufacturing were generally in line with forecasts.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 41.63 points, or 0.39 percent, at 10,829.68. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 5.04 points, or 0.44 percent, at 1,146.24 and the Nasdaq was 2.13 points, or 0.09 percent, higher at 2,370.75. 
All three indexes were generally flat for the week.
United and Continental closed their merger on Friday. Shares of the newly combined company, United Continental Holdings, rose 25 cents, or 1.07 percent, to $23.66.
In the bond market, the price of the 10-year Treasury note was unchanged at 101, and the yield was unchanged at 2.51 percent.
After the major indexes ended the third quarter on Thursday with increases, investors are now focusing on the next corporate earnings season in hopes that it will inspire future rallies.
Peter Cardillo, chief market economist for Avalon Partners, said the Fed was adding to the impetus for the possibility of further monetary easing.
On Friday, two Fed officials added their voices to the recent remarks suggesting such measures were in store for the economy.
The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Charles L. Evans, said during a speech in Rome that more monetary easing might be ''desirable.''
And the New York Federal Reserve president, William C. Dudley, said in a speech that bank officials had the tools that could provide additional stimulus ''at costs that do not appear to be prohibitive.''
''Thus, I conclude that further action is likely to be warranted,'' Mr. Dudley said, ''unless the economic outlook evolves in a way that makes me more confident that we will see better outcomes for both employment and inflation before too long.''
He also noted that, in light of the Fed's dual mandate of creating the highest level of employment while consistent with price stability, ''the current situation is wholly unsatisfactory.''
Economists interpreted his remarks to mean that there was the strong possibility that further measures would be announced after the Federal Open Market Committee's meeting in November.
Government reports showed personal income was up 0.5 percent in August, an improvement over the previous two months, and spending rose 0.4 percent.
''I think that the economic data is stronger than expected, and the personal income numbers provided a starting point'' for the market, said Alan Gayle, a senior investment strategist at RidgeWorth Capital Management. ''But the fact that the market is being backstopped by the prospect of additional Fed support I think is making investors more confident of stepping in,'' he said.
Also on the economic front, the Institute for Supply Management reported that its survey of manufacturing fellto 54.4 percent in September, from 56.3 percent. in August. The latest reading was slightly lower than the 54.5 that economists polled by Reuters had forecast. Any reading above 50 on the index indicates that the sector is expanding, and shares of Boeing, General Electric and 3M rose on the news.
In addition, the Commerce Department reported that spending on construction rose slightly, or 0.4 percent, in August, though the rise was mainly a result of government projects. The slight rise came after a decline of 1.4 percent for July.
Joshua Shapiro, the chief United States economist with MFR, said that the new orders index in the manufacturing report declined, indicating weak final demand growth. Energy, materials and financials were all up more than 1 percent at the close, with manufacturers up. Boeing ended up 29 cents at $66.83, and General Electric rose 11 cents to $16.36.
Technology shares were down less than 1 percent, the only sector in the broader market to show a decline.
Meanwhile, the University of Michigan consumer sentiment index for September was revised slightly higher, to 68.2 points, from an earlier estimate of 66.6.

HEADLINE: Recession May Be Over, but Consumer Pessimism Is Still Plumbing New Depths

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and economics on his blog at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
AMERICANS became more pessimistic about their chances for higher incomes during the Great Recession than at any time in the past 45 years. That pessimism has eased, but still remains high. 
The consumer confidence index fell in September, according to preliminary figures released this week by the Conference Board. That decline was largely because of lower expectations.
The expectations index is based on three questions about what consumers expect to happen over the next six months -- whether business conditions will improve, whether there will be more or fewer jobs, and whether they expect their own incomes to rise or fall. In September, for the first time since July 2009, there were more negative than positive responses to all those questions.
In previous recessions, there has been widespread pessimism about the overall economy. But this recession was the first since the survey began in 1967 when more people expected their own incomes to fall.
Before this recession, no survey ever showed as few as 15 percent of Americans optimistic about their own prospects. But since October 2008, when the financial crisis intensified after the failure of Lehman Brothers, the figure has been below 15 percent. Similarly, the proportion of pessimists had never been as high as 15 percent before the financial crisis, but it has been above that figure for the last two years.
At the height of the financial crisis, in March 2009, less than 8 percent of Americans expected their incomes to improve, while about 24 percent anticipated a decline. The figures released this week showed about 10 percent were optimistic about their incomes, while about 16 percent still expected a fall.
The pessimism in 2009 came as unemployment rose above 10 percent in October, a figure it is still near. But the rate had been higher in 1982, when there was less pessimism. In part, that may reflect the fact that many people who kept their jobs in the recent recession were forced to accept pay cuts, something that had not happened in earlier downturns.
The rise in pessimism has also come as major asset categories have performed poorly. The median sales price of existing homes is lower now than it was five years ago. Before this recession, home prices always rose at a rate of at least 2.5 percent a year over five-year periods, according to data the National Association of Realtors began collecting in 1968.
And despite rising 8.8 percent in September, the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks remains below where it was five years earlier. There was a similar prolonged period of weak stock prices in the 1970s, but stocks were far less important then to most Americans.
Stocks are more important now because more people see their retirement depending on their own investments. That change came as fewer companies offered defined-benefit pension plans and more people had 401(k) defined contribution plans, which were often invested in stock mutual funds. By early 2000 -- as the stock market was peaking -- 43 percent of household financial assets were in stocks, triple the proportion in the mid-1980s.
The Federal Reserve estimates that Americans had $43.8 trillion in financial assets at the end of June, 15 percent below the figure for September 2007, shortly before the recession began.

HEADLINE: Sarkozy To Propose New Bond With Russia

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER and KATRIN BENNHOLD

 BODY:
PARIS -- President Nicolas Sarkozy of France plans to propose a new security and economic relationship between Europe and Russia when he meets with President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany this month in Deauville, senior French officials said Friday.
The idea is to have a single zone of security and economic cooperation, the officials said, that will pull Russia closer to Europe but apart from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The alliance itself is holding a key meeting in November intended to approve a new strategic doctrine, and American officials are unhappy with the idea of France and Germany talking to Russia -- without the United States present -- about security in advance of the talks. 
''Since when, I wonder, is European security no longer an issue of American concern, but something for Europe and Russia to resolve?'' asked a senior American official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ''After being at the center of European security for 70 years, it's strange to hear that it is no longer a matter of U.S. concern.''
Still, NATO's relevance is in question as it struggles to hold together in the fight against the Taliban in Afghanistan, and Russia seems to many to be a natural part of Europe and an important, if difficult, ally on issues like Iran and global terrorism.
France is taking over the presidency of the Group of 20 in November, which will also be a topic at the meetings in Deauville Oct. 18-19. Mr. Sarkozy is planning a series of initiatives to turn the group from a body concerned primarily with crisis management to one focused more on long-term coordination among major economic powers.
To that end, he has been consulting with Chinese officials for more than a year about the thorny issue of exchange rates and his ambitious idea for a new global monetary system, including a new institution to better coordinate movements in major currencies.
The idea of a new European ''security architecture'' has been raised by Mr. Medvedev as something more appropriate for the post-cold-war world than the Atlantic alliance and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
American officials have been skeptical, saying that they will agree to nothing that would dilute the alliance or the organization, but instead seek to pull Russia into closer cooperation with NATO.
But Mr. Sarkozy has argued in the past that Russia is now a partner of the West, not a threat to it, and must be treated as such. For those reasons he has defended the sale to Russia of French Mistral ships, which can carry tanks and helicopters, despite concerns from Georgia and the Baltic nations that Russia could use them to expand its zone of influence.
The Mistral is only one part of a much broader charm offensive with Russia by France, intended to win more business from its oil- and gas-rich neighbor to the east.
The two countries are currently engaged in a ''France-Russia year,'' a giant mutual marketing exercise comprising 400 cultural events and a flurry of high-level political visits.
Mr. Sarkozy is known for raising large ideas that do not always come to fruition, with a recent example being the Union for the Mediterranean, a project for cooperation among countries rimming the Mediterranean.
He is facing severe political problems at home, with low approval ratings, lingering scandals and a series of protests over his plans to raise the minimum retirement age. He is looking to the presidency of the Group of 20 and that of the smaller Group of 8 beginning in January to raise his international profile and improve his standing at home as a world leader ahead of the 2012 presidential election.
As the head of the Group of 20, Mr. Sarkozy intends to ask individual heads of state to run a series of working seminars on critical issues, leading to a summit meeting at the end of his one-year term. Two of these issues are how to provide more stability both to exchange rates and to commodity prices.
The seminars would be held in different countries. Mr. Sarkozy has often spoken of the need for a new Bretton Woods, the 1944 conference that set up a system of fixed exchange rates.
He speaks now of coordination, not fixed rates, and of bringing China more fully into the international system, with responsibilities to match its new stature.

HEADLINE: Not Quite Truth-in-Mortgages

BYLINE: By RON LIEBER

 BODY:
One of the most important lessons of the mortgage collapse is that potential borrowers need clear explanations of exactly what kind of commitment they are making.
So in the last couple of years, there has been a recurring national conversation around proper disclosures, underwriting standards and fiscal prudence. All have nodded their heads solemnly and pledged to do better.
And where has this gotten us? Consider a postcard that arrived in mailboxes in September, announcing itself with a brash, declarative statement: the best mortgage on the block.
That sounds very 2005, but this is not some fly-by-night operation peddling the loan. It's ING Direct USA, the people who popularized the online savings account and have since moved into checking, investment accounts and mortgages. 
The ING Direct loan is called a 5/1 Orange Mortgage, and as of early September, it came with a 3.25 percent interest rate for the first five years and a projected interest rate of 3.375 percent for the 25 years after that.
Yes, you read that right, under 3.5 percent for the next 30 years.
But that is not right, in any number of ways. First of all, by not using the words ''adjustable rate mortgage'' or similar terms to describe the loan, ING Direct violated a simple Federal Reserve disclosure rule that was revised in 2008.
And that ''projected'' interest rate suggesting that today's record low rates will continue for a generation? It is utter nonsense. But ING Direct seems to have had no choice but to use the numbers that it did, because of another relatively new Federal Reserve rule.
It all sort of makes you wonder: have we accomplished anything over the last several years?
ING Direct is one of the great (and one of the few) success stories in consumer financial services in the United States over the last decade. Since it opened in the United States in 2000, the company -- a unit of the Dutch financial services giant ING -- has worked with more than seven million customers, and people have more than $90 billion parked there. It is the 17th-largest bank in the country by deposits.
The company grew its savings account business through savvy marketing, but it turns out to be much more complicated to explain mortgages in a handful of snappy sentences. The postcard, for example, notes that the interest rate may increase after the fixed period has ended. But in 2008, the Federal Reserve updated Regulation Z, part of which covers mortgage advertisements, in an effort to ensure clear wording from lenders so that customers would never mistake a variable rate loan for a fixed one.
The rule sets the following requirement for any entities using the word ''fixed'' when describing in marketing materials the first period of what is ultimately an adjustable-rate mortgage: The pitch must specifically describe that loan as an ''ARM,'' an ''adjustable-rate mortgage'' or a ''variable-rate mortgage.'' Moreover, lenders or others must use one of these terms before the first mention of a fixed-rate period in any advertisement, just so there is no confusion.
ING Direct did not do this. ''We acknowledge that the particular mailer you received lacked the specific words 'Adjustable Rate,' '' the company said in a statement, a copy of which I've posted on our Bucks blog. ''Although it did say 'rate is subject to adjustment' and 'interest rate may increase.' The intent was to provide sufficient compelling information to prompt a customer to call for additional details.''
The company also promised to be more careful in the future, saying that it ''will make certain that future mortgage mailers demonstrate transparency that is representative of ING Direct and that our customers have come to expect.''
Here's the particular problem ING Direct faces in describing its loans. These terms -- ARMs and adjustable- or variable-rate loans -- are now dirty words among risk-averse consumers, especially those who know the trouble that such loans caused in recent years.
Still, ING Direct's competitors hold their noses and use the terms in their own mortgage mailings.
Why? Perhaps in part it's because they also offer fixed-rate mortgages. ING Direct does not offer standard fixed-rate mortgages, so any customer scared off by its mortgages would need to go elsewhere for a loan, possibly another ING unit.
So is that the reason ING Direct seems to bend over backward to avoid using the dirty words?
''I don't share that premise whatsoever,'' said Bill Higgins, ING Direct's chief lending officer, who added that the bank's own salespeople often suggest to customers that they would be better off with a different type of mortgage.
Meanwhile, the bank's loans appear to have held up pretty well so far. Only 2.88 percent of loans originated in 2007 or earlier are more than 90 days past due at the moment, far below the national average.
But then there's the matter of the ''projected interest rate.'' Regulation Z requires companies to make a projection and insists that they use current figures to do so. Why use today's numbers? Well, nobody knows what the rates will be in five or seven years when the interest rate resets on loans like those offered by ING Direct. This rule was changed after some lenders offered teaser rates -- say, 1 percent for only a month or so. The Fed's idea was to give borrowers a sense of the rate they might face.
Now, however, any bank that follows the letter of the law without any further explanation ends up leaving the impression that today's rock-bottom rates will last forever. They almost certainly will rise once the economy improves.
So why not just say that rates are likely to go up? When I asked about this, Mr. Higgins repeatedly pointed to other banks that used similar information about the projected rates as ING Direct but offered disclosures that were much less prominent. He added that customers had not complained about the issues I'm raising here. So noted.
Then again, ING Direct holds itself to a much higher standard than old-fashioned banks. The president and chairman of ING Direct USA, Arkadi Kuhlmann, stated this plainly in the book he co-wrote, ''The Orange Code,'' which came out last year.
''Telling the truth is not easy,'' he wrote. ''The best way, of course, is to say the truth easily and quickly when the first opportunity arises.''
ING Direct had that opportunity with this postcard. And Regulation Z or no, the likely truth is that the rates on its loan will not be 3.375 percent for the 25 years after the fixed-rate period expires. So why not explain just how high the interest rate could rise and what the highest and lowest monthly payments could be on a typical loan?
''I'm not sure what that would add to the advertisement,'' Mr. Higgins said.
Here's what it would add: The loan rate, according to the company, could rise as high as 9.250 percent. So a starting payment of $1,023 on a $235,000 loan could rise by 73 percent, to $1,773. That information does not take up a whole lot of room, even on a postcard.
Given that this sort of explanation would probably reduce the mortgage applications ING Direct receives, it's no wonder that the bank is not eager to be on the cutting edge of disclosure.
Also, starting early next year, banks will be required to include some of this extra information in disclosure statements that applicants for loans receive later in the process. And ING Direct does let people know on its Web site how high the rate for this loan could go, though it does not do the math that would allow them to realize that their payments could rise so high.
Elizabeth Warren, the Harvard legal scholar, has already made it clear that mortgage disclosures are a priority for the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that President Obama has asked her to set up. On the day Mr. Obama announced her new role, Mr. Kuhlmann wrote a blog post saying that the appointment was ''a step in the right direction for consumers.''
Perhaps the two of them can begin a joint campaign to make adjustable-rate mortgage lenders present the worst case in every single ad.

PERSON: Joseph Sobran 

HEADLINE: Joseph Sobran, 64, Writer Whom Buckley Mentored

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:
Joseph Sobran, a hard-hitting conservative writer and moralist whose outspoken antipathy to Israel and what he saw as the undue influence of a Jewish lobby on American foreign policy led to his removal as a senior editor of National Review in 1993, died on Thursday in Fairfax, Va. He was 64 and lived in Burke, Va.
The cause was kidney failure resulting from diabetes, his daughter Christina Sobran said. 
Mr. Sobran (pronounced SO-brun), one of the conservative whiz kids whom William F. Buckley draft-picked for National Review straight out of college, made his mark with witty, thoughtful essays on moral and social questions. He was an unapologetic paleoconservative, opposed to military intervention abroad, big government at home and moral permissiveness everywhere.
As a conservative Roman Catholic, he made a particular target of the Supreme Court's decisions legalizing abortion and protecting pornography as free speech. Unlike many of his colleagues, he took little interest in electoral politics or the machinery of government. At the same time, he nourished a libertarian streak that gradually took over, eventually pushing him to declare himself an anarchist.
''I much preferred a literary, contemplative conservatism to the activist sort that was preoccupied with immediate political issues,'' he wrote in a 2002 essay explaining his conversion to anarchism. ''During the Reagan years, which I expected to find exciting, I found myself bored to death with supply-side economics, enterprise zones, 'privatizing' welfare programs and similar principle-dodging gimmickry.''
In the mid-1980s he ran into trouble with Mr. Buckley for the first time after writing several columns critical of American policy in the Middle East.
Matters came to a head in 1993. Mr. Sobran, unhappy with National Review's support for the 1991 Persian Gulf war, and with Mr. Buckley's criticism of his writing on Jews and the Middle East, attacked Mr. Buckley in his ''Washington Watch'' column in The Wanderer, a traditionalist Roman Catholic weekly.
When informed by National Review's editor in chief, John O'Sullivan, that the column amounted to a letter of resignation, Mr. Sobran was fired.
Mr. Buckley, angry that Mr. Sobran had included conversations from a private dinner that the two had had, and stung by the depiction of him as kowtowing to Manhattan's social elite, wrote in a letter to The Wanderer that the column ''gives evidence of an incapacitation moral and perhaps medical, which news is both bad, and sad,'' adding that Mr. Sobran's criticisms were ''a breath-catching libel.'' The two men later reconciled.
Mr. Sobran's isolationist views on American foreign policy and Israel became increasingly extreme. He took a skeptical line on the Holocaust and said the Sept. 11 terror attacks were a result of American foreign policy in the Middle East, which he believed that a Jewish lobby directed. Not surprisingly, he spent much of his time defending himself against charges of anti-Semitism.
''Nobody has ever accused me of the slightest personal indecency to a Jew,'' he said in a speech delivered at a 2002 conference of the Institute for Historical Review. ''My chief offense, it appears, has been to insist that the state of Israel has been a costly and treacherous 'ally' to the United States. As of last Sept. 11, I should think that is undeniable. But I have yet to receive a single apology for having been correct.''
Michael Joseph Sobran Jr. was born on Feb. 23, 1946, in Ypsilanti, Mich. He studied English and American literature at Eastern Michigan University, where he earned a bachelor's degree in 1969, and went on to do graduate work on Shakespeare, a lifelong preoccupation.
In 1997 the Free Press published ''Alias Shakespeare: Solving the Greatest Literary Mystery of All Time,'' an argument in support of the theory that Shakespeare's plays were written by Edward de Vere, the Earl of Oxford.
While at Eastern Michigan, he sent letters to several professors who objected to an impending visit by Mr. Buckley, rebutting their criticisms point by point. Mr. Buckley later saw the letters and in 1972 offered Mr. Sobran a job writing for National Review.
Mr. Sobran also wrote a syndicated column for The Los Angeles Times and Universal Press Syndicate, and regularly appeared on the CBS radio series ''Spectrum.'' He contributed to The Wanderer, The Human Life Review, The American Spectator and other publications. In 1994 he founded Sobran's: The Real News of the Month, a newsletter that ceased publication in 2007.
Mr. Sobran addressed social issues in his columns, especially questions pertaining to abortion, the family and marriage. Many of his essays were collected in ''Single Issues: Essays on the Crucial Social Questions.''
He wrote often on the Constitution as well, and as he underwent a slow conversion to anarchism beginning in the late 1980s, he arrived at the conclusion, based on his reading of the 10th Amendment, that virtually every act of the federal government since the Civil War was illegal.
His two marriages ended in divorce. In addition to his daughter Christina, of Waterville, Me., he is survived by another daughter, Vanessa Williams of Virginia Beach, Va.; two sons, Kent, of Toledo, Ohio, and Michael, of Alexandria, Va.; a brother, Greg, of Ann Arbor, Mich.; 10 grandchildren; one great-grandchild; and several half-siblings: Thomas Sobran and Eric Sobran, both of Hingham, Mass.; Paige Sobran of Weymouth, Mass.; Evan Sobran of Duxbury, Mass.; Gray Sobran and Peter Sobran, both of Madison, Conn.; Gerald Fox of Chandler, Ariz.; Robert Fox of Ypsilanti, Mich.; and Patrick Fox of Casa Grande, Ariz.
Correction: October 5, 2010, Tuesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An obituary on Saturday about Joseph Sobran, the conservative writer, misstated the manner of his departure from National Review. He was fired after criticizing the magazine's founder, William F. Buckley Jr., in a column for another publication; he did not step down. It also misstated the distributor of his syndicated column and the publisher of his book ''Single Issues: Essays on the Crucial Social Questions.'' The column was distributed by Universal Press Syndicate, not United Press International, and the book was published by Human Life Press, not Griffin Communications.

HEADLINE: ACCORD PAVES WAY FOR IRAQI PREMIER TO BE RE-ELECTED

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS; Reporting was contributed by Helene Cooper from Washington, Yasir Ghazi and Zaid Thaker from Baghdad, and Namo Abdulla from Erbil, Iraq.

 BODY:
BAGHDAD -- Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki of Iraq appeared almost assured of a second term in office on Friday after securing the support of an anti-American Shiite Islamic movement whose return to political power could profoundly complicate relations with the United States.
The deal came as a breakthrough after nearly seven months of bare-knuckle back-room bargaining that followed the country's election on March 7. 
It came with political costs, uncertainty and risks, splintering a broad Shiite alliance and threatening to raise tensions with Sunnis who largely supported a secular Shiite leader, Ayad Allawi.
As a result, it could still take weeks or longer for Mr. Maliki to secure re-election and form a new government, even as public frustration and extremist violence continue to mount. But Mr. Maliki spoke late Friday night with certainty that the long contest of wills was finally over.
''We are confident that with the cooperation and efforts of honorable and faithful Iraqis, we will, God willing, be able to overcome the difficulties, challenges and problems and complete the construction of the institutions of state of a free, democratic Iraq,'' Mr. Maliki said in televised remarks.
He owes his new support to the extraordinary political resurrection of Moktada al-Sadr, the self-exiled cleric whose fighters once battled in the streets of Baghdad, Basra and other cities with Iraqi and American troops. Until days ago he fiercely opposed Mr. Maliki's re-election.
Mr. Maliki's success reflected his tenacity -- tinged with authoritarianism -- to retain power, despite widespread opposition to his leadership. It also showed his willingness to disregard -- for political expediency -- American concerns about the return of Mr. Sadr's followers to the center of political power.
A dour, uncharismatic leader, Mr. Maliki has persisted in arguing that only he can prevent a descent into the sectarian carnage that consumed Iraq when he took office in 2006, even if that means allying with a movement blamed for much of the violence.
While Obama administration officials insisted over months of quiet diplomacy that they preferred no candidate, only a broadly inclusive government, they made it clear that they did not favor a government that included the Sadrists, who are closely allied with Iran and oppose the presence of American troops.
This week, a senior American military commander in Baghdad blamed Shiite extremist groups, including one affiliated with Mr. Sadr, for a spike in rocket attacks on the capital's Green Zone.
In Washington, officials were noticeably cool to news of the agreement between Mr. Maliki and Mr. Sadr, in no small part because it signaled an ascendant Iranian influence in Iraq.
''An Iraqi government that owes its existence to the Sadrists and lacks strong support from Allawi would necessarily be one that leans in Tehran's direction, something Washington can little afford at the moment,'' Daniel P. Serwer, a vice president at the United States Institute of Peace, said in an e-mail.
Mr. Maliki, who is 60, now has the backing of at least 148 lawmakers in the new 325-member Parliament to form a government, just short of a majority. The Kurds, with 57 seats among several parties, indicated Friday that they, too, would support his re-election, though only with concessions on territorial, economic and political issues.
''Now he has a great possibility to become prime minister again,'' said a prominent Kurdish lawmaker, Mahmoud Othman.
That would give Mr. Maliki a solid majority, though he must still cobble together a governing coalition among various parties jockeying for control of important positions and ministries, especially those overseeing oil and the security forces.
''What happened now is the best for Iraqis,'' said a leader of Mr. Maliki's party, Ali al-Adeeb.
He called for a swift session of Parliament to elect Mr. Maliki and pledged to continue talks to include other factions, especially Mr. Allawi's, which includes almost all of the newly elected Sunni lawmakers. Mr. Maliki echoed that in his statement.
Mr. Allawi's bloc vowed to oppose the nomination, but despite winning slightly more seats than Mr. Maliki did, 91 to 89, he and his supporters did not appear to have enough votes to do so.
It was not immediately clear when the new Parliament, known as the Council of Representatives, would meet again. It has convened only once, for 18 minutes, despite constitutional deadlines that have passed unheeded.
By law, the members must first elect a president, who then authorizes the leading bloc to form a government coalition.
Mr. Maliki's nomination underscored the ever-shifting alliances of power here. The Sadrists at first backed Adel Abdul Mahdi, one of two vice presidents who is a leader of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq, which was part of a broader Shiite alliance that joined Mr. Maliki's bloc after the election, only to disagree on who should be prime minister.
That party's leaders boycotted the nominating session on Friday and met later with Mr. Allawi. A party member, Ali Shubar, said it would oppose Mr. Maliki because ''we won't vote for another failed government.'' The outcome of the struggle over the next prime minister showed the ebbing of the power of a party that once dominated Shiite politics after Saddam Hussein's toppling.
The Sadrists proved to be more effective and disciplined campaigners, with strong grass-roots support among Iraq's Shiites. Having embraced politics, they are now poised to wield influence they have not had since they withdrew from the previous government in 2006.
The Sadrist leaders present on Friday did not explain their drastic and sudden swing toward Mr. Maliki. But in a statement two days ago, issued from Iran, where he is studying theology, Mr. Sadr sounded the pragmatic note of a seasoned politician.
He cited a saying of his father, Ayatollah Muhammad Sadiq al-Sadr, a revered Shiite leader who was killed in 1999 under Mr. Hussein's regime.
''Politics has no heart,'' Mr. Sadr said, in response to a letter from a follower. ''Be informed, politics is giving and taking.''
One of the main issues facing Iraq in the coming year is what, if any, American military presence will continue after a deadline in December 2011 for withdrawing the remaining 50,000 American troops here.
Diplomats and military commanders here have already signaled an interest in maintaining a close security relationship with Iraq as it rebuilds its armed services and solidifies its fragile democratic institutions.
While many Iraqi political and military leaders have expressed support for that, the Sadrists remain opposed to what they call ''a foreign occupation.''

HEADLINE: Movement of the Moment Looks to Long-Ago Texts

BYLINE: By KATE ZERNIKE

 BODY:
The Tea Party is a thoroughly modern movement, organizing on Twitter and Facebook to become the most dynamic force of the midterm elections.
But when it comes to ideology, it has reached back to dusty bookshelves for long-dormant ideas.
It has resurrected once-obscure texts by dead writers -- in some cases elevating them to best-seller status -- to form a kind of Tea Party canon. Recommended by Tea Party icons like Ron Paul and Glenn Beck, the texts are being quoted everywhere from protest signs to Republican Party platforms.
Pamphlets in the Tea Party bid for a Second American Revolution, the works include Frederic Bastiat's ''The Law,'' published in 1850, which proclaimed that taxing people to pay for schools or roads was government-sanctioned theft, and Friedrich Hayek's ''Road to Serfdom'' (1944), which argued that a government that intervened in the economy would inevitably intervene in every aspect of its citizens' lives. 
The relative newcomer is ''The 5000 Year Leap,'' self-published in 1981 by an anti-communist crusader shunned by his fellow Mormons for his more controversial positions, including a hearty defense of the John Birch Society. It asserts that the Founding Fathers had not intended separation of church and state, and would have considered taxes to provide for the welfare of others ''a sin.''
If their arguments can be out there (like getting rid of the 17th Amendment, which established the direct election of senators by popular vote) or out of date (Bastiat warned that if government taxed wine and tobacco, ''beggars and vagabonds will demand the right to vote''), the works have provided intellectual ballast for a segment of the electorate angry or frustrated about the economy and the growing reach of government.
They have convinced their readers that economists, the Founding Fathers, and indeed, God, are on their side when they accuse President Obama and the Democrats of being ''socialists.'' And they have established a counternarrative to what Tea Party supporters denounce as the ''progressive'' interpretation of economics and history in mainstream texts.
All told, the canon argues for a vision of the country where government's role is to protect private property -- against taxes as much as against thieves. Where religion plays a bigger role in public life. Where any public safety net is unconstitutional. And where the way back to prosperity is for markets to be left free from regulation.
As the Tea Party has exerted increasing force over American politics, the influence of the books has shown up in many ways.
Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, alluded to ''The Road to Serfdom'' in introducing his economic ''Roadmap for America's Future,'' which many other Republicans have embraced. Ron Johnson, who entered politics through a Tea Party meeting and is now the Republican nominee for Senate in Wisconsin, asserted that the $20 billion escrow fund that the Obama administration forced BP to set up to pay damages from the Gulf of Mexico oil spill circumvented ''the rule of law,'' Hayek's term for the unwritten code that prohibits the government from interfering with the pursuit of ''personal ends and desires.''
Justin Amash, the 30-year-old Republican state legislator running for the House seat once held by Gerald Ford in Michigan, frequently posts links to essays by Hayek and Bastiat on his Facebook page, his chief vehicle for communicating with voters. ''There is no single economist or philosopher I admire more than F. A. Hayek,'' he wrote in May. ''I have his portrait on the wall of my legislative office and the Justin Amash for Congress office.''
In Maine, Tea Party activists jammed the state Republican convention last spring to reject the party platform, replacing it with one that urged ''a return to the principles of Austrian economics,'' as espoused by Hayek, and the belief that ''freedom of religion does not mean freedom from religion.'' The new platform also embraced the idea that ''it is immoral to steal the property earned by one individual and give it to another who has no claim or right to its benefits'' -- a line ripped from Bastiat's jeremiad against taxation and welfare.
The Tea Party canon includes other works, some of them unlikely. Organizers have promoted ''Rules for Radicals,'' by Saul D. Alinsky, as a primer on community organizing tactics, and ''The Starfish and the Spider: The Unstoppable Power of Leaderless Organizations,'' by Ori Brafman and Rod A. Beckstrom, an argument for the strength of movements built around ideas rather than leaders.
But the ideological works tend to draw heavily on the classics of Austrian economics (Hayek, Bastiat and Ludwig von Mises) and on works arguing for a new perspective on the Constitution and the Founding Fathers. (''The 5000 Year Leap,'' ''The Real George Washington'' and ''The Real Thomas Jefferson.'')
Doug Bramley, a postal worker and Tea Party activist in Maine, picked up ''The Road to Serfdom'' after Mr. Beck mentioned it on air in June. (Next up for Mr. Bramley, another classic of libertarian thought: ''I've got to read 'Atlas Shrugged,' '' he said.) He found Hayek ''dense reading,'' but he loved ''The 5000 Year Leap.''
''You don't read it,'' Mr. Bramley said, ''you study it.''
Across the country, many Tea Party groups are doing just that, often taking a chapter to discuss at each meeting.
The book was published in 1981 by W. Cleon Skousen, a former Salt Lake City police chief who had a best seller in ''The Naked Communist'' in the 1960s, and died in 2006 at the age of 92. ''The 5000 Year Leap'' hit the top of the Amazon rankings in 2009 after Mr. Beck put it on his list for the 9/12 groups, his brand of Tea Party.
It spins the Constitution in a way most legal scholars would not recognize -- even those who embrace an ''originalist'' interpretation.
It argues that the Founding Fathers were guided by 28 ''principles of liberty,'' above all, a belief that government should be based on ''Natural Law,'' or ''a code of right reason from the Creator himself.'' The founders, Skousen wrote, believed in the equal protection of rights, but not the equal distribution of things -- an argument that many Tea Party activists now make against the health care overhaul passed in March.
''One of the worst sins of government, according to the Founders, was the exercise of coercive taxing powers to take property from one group and give it to another,'' he wrote.
''Leap'' argues that when Jefferson spoke of a ''wall of separation between church and state,'' he was referring only to the federal government, and was in fact ''anxious'' for the state governments to promote religion. In Skousen's interpretation, public schools should be used for religious study, and should encourage Bible reading.
It is from this book that many Tea Party supporters and candidates have argued for repeal of the 17th Amendment. Prior to the amendment, state legislators elected United States senators. ''Since that time,'' Skousen wrote, ''there has been no veto power which the states could exercise against the Congress in those cases where a federal statute was deemed in violation of states' rights.''
Neither Hayek nor Bastiat were writing with the United States in mind. But their arguments, too, have become fodder for a movement that believes that government intervention is the wrong solution to the country's economic woes -- and is, in fact, the problem, resulting in runaway national debt.
Hayek, who won the Nobel Prize in economic sciences in 1974, argued that when a government begins any kind of central economic planning, it must decide which needs are more and less important, and therefore ends up controlling every aspect of its citizens lives.
Bastiat called taxation ''legal plunder,'' allowing the government to take something from one person and use it for the benefit of someone else, ''doing what the citizen himself cannot do without committing a crime.'' In his view, protective tariffs, subsidies, progressive taxation, public schools, a minimum wage, and public assistance programs were of a piece. ''All of these plans as a whole,'' he wrote, ''constitute socialism.''
The works are more suited to protest than to policy making, as Bastiat himself recognized. ''If you wish to be strong, begin by rooting out every particle of socialism that may have crept into your legislation,'' he urged. ''This will be no light task.''

HEADLINE: In Comments, Fed Officials Signal New Economic Push

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN; Christine Hauser contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Momentum within the Federal Reserve this week continued to build toward resuming purchases of huge amounts of government debt to help the flagging economic recovery.
The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the most powerful of the 12 Fed regional presidents, made a significant argument for the strategy Friday, joining similar expressions of cautious support this week by his counterparts in Boston and Chicago. Their statements helped solidify a belief on Wall Street that the central bank was likely to resume large-scale purchases of Treasury securities after the Nov. 2 elections.
The Fed has kept short-term interest rates, its main policy tool, near zero since December 2008. The theory behind the new debt-buying strategy is that the central bank can free up credit by creating money to buy long-term assets and therefore make the cost of long-run borrowing, already low, even cheaper.
Gridlock over fiscal policy in Washington has most likely added pressure on the Fed to use monetary policy to support the economy, though Fed officials have not publicly said that. What the officials are saying, in increasing unison, is that inflation is undesirably low, well below the implicit target of about 2 percent, and that unemployment, at 9.6 percent, is far too high. 
''Viewed through the lens of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate -- the pursuit of the highest level of employment consistent with price stability -- the current situation is wholly unsatisfactory,'' the New York Fed president, William C. Dudley, said in a speech in Midtown Manhattan. He suggested that the Fed should act unless economic conditions noticeably improve soon.
His perspective is believed to be in line with that of Janet L. Yellen, who was confirmed Wednesday as the Fed's vice chairwoman. Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, is increasingly viewed as sympathetic to that thinking but he has not disclosed his stance.
Other Fed officials backed Mr. Dudley's view. On Friday, Charles L. Evans, president of the Chicago Fed, said in Rome that it ''would be desirable'' for the Fed to provide additional monetary stimulus. ''We still have a long road ahead before we catch up to the level of activity we would have achieved in the absence of the crisis, or any other shock,'' he said.
And on Wednesday in New York, Eric S. Rosengren, president of the Boston Fed, sounded a similar note. ''While the economy is growing, it is currently growing too slowly to significantly reduce the unemployment rate or stem disinflationary pressures created by the high degree of slack in the economy,'' he warned.
The Fed bought $1.7 trillion in long-term securities -- a mixture of mortgage-linked bonds and Treasury securities -- from January 2009 to March 2010 to put downward pressure on long-term rates. But the slowdown in economic growth in recent months has caused the Fed to contemplate a second dose of monetary medicine.
Critics, notably a small but vocal minority of inflation hawks among the Fed's leaders, believe that the medicine could have dangerous future side effects. But the consensus seems to be coalescing around the position of the doves -- a group Mr. Dudley has apparently joined -- that the persistently high unemployment rate is unacceptable, particularly at a time when inflation is so low.
Mr. Dudley discounted a much-discussed alternative to quantitative easing: using the Fed's public communications to make it clear it intended to keep the benchmark short-term rate -- the federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another overnight -- at nearly zero for even longer than the markets already expect.
That approach could help lower inflation expectations, which play a crucial role in determining future price movements. But those expectations are already very low, and Mr. Dudley said the approach might merely create uncertainty about future inflation instead of lowering expectations further.
Instead, Mr. Dudley spoke favorably about quantitative easing, citing calculations suggesting that ''$500 billion worth of purchases would provide about as much stimulus as a reduction in the federal funds rate of between half a point and three-quarters of a point.'' That effect would be dependent on how long the markets expected the Fed to hold onto the assets, he added.
Lower long-term rates would support home prices and household net worth, ideally making housing more affordable, permit more homeowners to refinance their mortgages, and reduce the cost of borrowing for businesses, Mr. Dudley said.
Mr. Dudley did outline two potential drawbacks to quantitative easing.
One is that expanding the Fed's exceptionally large balance sheet even further could unsettle inflation expectations -- a concern Mr. Dudley said could be allayed with a demonstration by the Fed that it had the tools and willingness to return to normal monetary policy when the time came. The other objection is that additional asset purchases would expose the Fed to fluctuations in short-term rates. When those rates eventually rise, the Fed will have less money to turn over to the Treasury each year.
Mr. Dudley made it clear that he did not consider either concern insurmountable. ''My assessment is that both the current levels of unemployment and inflation and the time frame over which they are likely to return to levels consistent with our mandate are unacceptable,'' he said, adding, that ''the longer this situation prevails'' the greater the risk that a new shock could unmoor the economy further and push it ''closer to outright deflation.''
But skeptics have been equally outspoken.
On Friday, Richard W. Fisher, president of the Dallas Fed, said a new round of debt-buying ''could flood the engine of the economy with gas that might later ignite inflation.''
Charles I. Plosser of the Philadelphia Fed said Wednesday in a speech in Vineland, N.J., that ''it is difficult, in my view, to see how additional asset purchases by the Fed, even if they move interest rates on long-term bonds down by 10 or 20 basis points, will have much impact on the near-term outlook for employment.'' (A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.)
Mr. Plosser warned that additional action could hurt the Fed's credibility and create the impression that the Fed was trying to ''monetize'' the deficit by printing money. Mr. Dudley on Friday called that fear ''fundamentally mistaken,'' saying the Fed would be creating money only to help get the recovery back on track, not to relieve the country's fiscal strains.
Even as some Fed officials staked their ground, others appeared to be on the fence. Narayana R. Kocherlakota of the Minneapolis Fed said on Wednesday in London that a new round of quantitative easing would be less powerful than the last one because the financial markets had stabilized, but he did not rule out the approach.

GRAPHIC: PHOTOS GRAPHIC: Camps Within the Fed: The Federal Reserve's board of governors and 12 regional bank presidents are collectively leaning toward a decision in November to begin a major new round of government debt purchases to stimulate the flagging economic recovery. The central bank's officials are divided on the wisdom of the move, but some of the most hawkish on inflation do not have a vote on the matter this year.

HEADLINE: Atlanta Hats? Seattle Socks? Macy's Goes Local

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
ATLANTA -- Long before it was renamed Macy's, the department store of choice here was Rich's. Opening just after the Civil War, it drew generations of Atlantans with its coconut cake and the Pink Pig, a Christmastime children's train.
Now, after years of ownership by New York-based Macy's, the old Rich's stores are feeling a bit more like Atlanta again. The generic display near an entrance at the Cumberland Mall store, for example, has been replaced with a rack of white satin suits -- yes, even in October.
''We have a lot of mega-churches here in Atlanta, and for first Sunday, the mothers of the church wear white all year long,'' said Terry McDonald, a human resources manager for Macy's Cumberland and surrounding stores, referring to a church service held once every month.
After decades of acquiring, consolidating and centralizing, the department store chain is rediscovering -- and financially exploiting -- its multiple local roots, advancing a trend that is quickly being adopted by other retailers like Saks Fifth Avenue and Best Buy. 
It is a lesson many companies overlooked in the last 30 years as they rolled smaller stores into huge national brands, and headquarters mandated what the outlets in Biloxi or Boise should sell.
But years of economic turmoil for the retail industry have helped refresh memories. While many national retailers continue to see sales declines in a sour economy, Macy's says its first full year of ''going local'' has helped increase sales significantly and ''lifted the entire Macy's performance,'' according to its chairman and chief executive, Terry J. Lundgren.
Macy's is on track to add $1 billion in sales in 2010 from stores open more than a year, he said. The retailer had $23.5 billion in sales in 2009.
''We have research information, and we think about household income and population size, but I think it's much more accurate to have people living in the marketplace tell you, 'This is who's shopping in my store,' '' Mr. Lundgren said.
The trend leaves some shoppers cold -- Macy's makeover of stores here has not stopped the longing for the real Rich's among many Atlantans -- but retail analysts say stores of all types are increasingly experimenting with local assortments to spur sales wherever they can.
''In prior years, with the recession, it became all about cost-cutting no matter what,'' said Esteban Bowles, a retail consultant with A. T. Kearney. ''Now companies are seeing the light and looking for the rebound.''
Macy's tested its new local approach in a handful of stores in 2008, introducing it in all 810 stores last year. In essence, Macy's requires sales clerks and store managers to examine the local population almost like anthropologists -- studying, for example, what churchgoing black women here in Atlanta shop for compared with the shopping habits of Microsoft wives, as employees call one segment of shoppers in the store in Bellevue, Wash.
At the same time, the retailer doubled its staff overseeing store assortments and decreased the stores that staff members dealt with. It required the people responsible for merchandise assortment to visit stores daily, added log books at each register where sales clerks entered suggestions from shoppers, and introduced a review process so the staff visiting stores could make recommendations to buyers.
There are items that would fit in an olden-days department store. The old Marshall Field's store in Chicago sells Frango chocolates, boxed as they were in the past. In the Northwest, at Bon Marche, Frangos come wrapped in cellophane and are packaged in an octagonal box, the traditional presentation in Seattle. In Minnesota this year, stores began carrying krumkake irons, a Scandinavian baking tool.
But localization is not just about turning back the clock. When many of the regional chains were at their height, shoppers tended to be middle-class white women. Now, they often are not.
In Bellevue, Wash., for example, fewer than 4 percent of residents were Asian in 1980, when the Macy's store there was a Bon Marche. The most recent Census Bureau survey showed the Asian population in Bellevue was 23.2 percent, attributable in part to the tech explosion in the area.
So the Bellevue Macy's has added more extra small and small sizes -- including size 0s in women's clothing and 36 in men's suits. And it got rid of its big and tall section. It also changed the jewelry selection to appeal to the tastes of Indian customers -- more gold and precious gems and less silver -- and doubled its sock department because of the many Microsoft visitors who travel and apparently forget their socks.
''You need to be able to target the pockets of consumers that exist in different shapes and forms in each of the communities,'' said Mr. Bowles, the retail consultant. At the Macy's in the Cumberland Mall here, localization has taken an entirely different look.
Cumberland is in the top tenth of all Macy's stores for hat sales, and in the men's department there are hats in virtually every section, from wool fedoras to Polo baseball caps. In the last year or so, the store has doubled both the space and the sales of men's hats.
''The fedora's real popular, too, because you see Ne-Yo in it,'' said Leigh Ott, the Macy's Cumberland store manager, referring to the rhythm and blues singer. ''Our African-American customers, they like the fashion, they like what's new.''
The Cumberland store also tripled the square footage of the big and tall department and has added curvy signs throughout the store to alert women shoppers to different fits. It also carries a special brand of jeans, PZI, that is for curvier women.
One popular men's brand just in the Macy's Cumberland store is Akoo, designed by the Atlanta rapper T. I. One Akoo lime green shirt is available only in sizes XL to 4XL.
''This customer isn't just big, he's also tall,'' said Leia Bangs, district vice president for the Macy's stores in western Atlanta.
In shoes, the Atlanta store displays tables of low-heeled black leather pumps, because Delta Air Lines, a major Atlanta employer, requires its flight attendants to wear heels of 0.5 to 3 inches.
And in the home department, the store has stocked up on a baking dish with a warmer stand and 34-quart stock pots (''for your Sunday church functions,'' Ms. McDonald explained).
Peter Sachse, chief marketing officer of Macy's, has seen the changes from both sides; he had been the president of Bon Marche in the Northwest before it was acquired by Macy's. He said what makes this attempt at localization -- known within the company as My Macy's -- different from running a local department store has been the systematic collection of information.
''We never had the organizational structure in the field that was feeding back to us constantly,'' Mr. Sachse said. ''Did you know the colors of the local high school are maroon and gold, and I need maroon and gold clothes because that's what they wear to the football games on Saturday?''
Still, for some shoppers, Macy's will always be that New York store -- a mind-set that even the most aggressive and targeted retailing might never overcome.
''I don't know what it was about the Bon -- it just seemed to have a more personal touch,'' said Maureen Haley, 54, of Kenmore, Wash.

HEADLINE: Still Stuck In Denial On Wall St.

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
There are some things Anthony Scaramucci would like you to know about him, right up front.
He would like you to know that he did not grow up with a silver spoon in his mouth. That he went to public school and Tufts University. That when he was interviewed for a job at Goldman Sachs, he wore a polyester suit. (''I didn't know any better.'') That he failed the bar exam after graduating from Harvard Law School. That he was eventually fired by Goldman Sachs (but was rehired by a different division). That despite these setbacks, he founded a firm -- a fund of funds called SkyBridge Capital -- that now employs 43 people, and has $7.4 billion under management. And that he's not one of those retrograde Wall Street types who thinks all taxes are evil.
''I'm pro-gay marriage,'' he said. ''Pro-choice. Against the death penalty. I have no problem if the government raises my taxes.'' 
And one other thing. Anthony Scaramucci wants you to know that he really, really wishes he had phrased that question he asked President Obama a few weeks ago a little differently. ''I wish I hadn't used the word pinata,'' he told me earlier this week. ''I was trying to throw him a softball.''
Did you see that exchange between Mr. Scaramucci and Mr. Obama? Jon Stewart feasted on it. It took place a week ago Monday, during the president's town hall meeting in Washington. After a little jocular back and forth -- Mr. Scaramucci was at Harvard Law at the same time as Mr. Obama, and joked about having once fouled the president on the basketball court -- he got to the point.
''I represent the Wall Street community,'' he began, wearing a suit that was decidedly not polyester. ''We have felt like a pinata. Maybe you don't feel like you're beating us with a stick but we certainly feel like we've been whacked with a stick.'' After going on a bit about job growth and the ''connection between Wall Street and Main Street,'' he returned to his theme. ''When are we going to stop whacking Wall Street like a pinata?''
In fact, Mr. Scaramucci had served up a softball question -- just not the kind he had intended. The rap on Mr. Obama from most Wall Street executives these days is that he is antibusiness. Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive of the Blackstone Group, compared Mr. Obama's approach to Wall Street as akin to Hitler invading Poland in 1939. (Mr. Schwarzman quickly apologized when the remark was made public.) The hedge fund manager Daniel Loeb turned his latest quarterly letter to his investors into an anti-Obama screed.
As Mr. Scaramucci later explained it, though, he wasn't trying to pile on. He supports Mr. Obama and wants him to succeed, he said. Rather, he was trying to tee up a question that, he hoped, would give the president a chance to begin to heal Wall Street's hurt. ''I thought I was giving him an opportunity to say he is pro-business,'' Mr. Scaramucci said.
Instead, Mr. Obama used Mr. Scaramucci's question to whack him like, well, a pinata. In the span of just a few minutes, Mr. Obama mentioned billion-dollar hedge fund compensation, Mr. Schwarzman's Hitler remark, the absurdity of a fund manager's secretary paying a higher tax rate than his or her boss, and the fact that ''most people on Main Street feel like they've been beat up on.'' He was interrupted several times by applause. ''He came at me with a baseball bat,'' complained Mr. Scaramucci.
When I went to see Mr. Scaramucci a few days later, my purpose was to get him to explain to me why it is that Wall Street feels so beleaguered. I'd been having a difficult time understanding it. Yes, the ''fat cat'' rhetoric can't be much fun to listen to, but is it really any worse than the political rhetoric used against health insurance executives, or the big oil companies or the teachers' unions? Hardly. In 1936, Franklin D. Roosevelt said of the financial industry executives, ''They are unanimous in their hate for me -- and I welcome their hatred.'' Mr. Obama hasn't said anything approaching that level of venom.
Nor have his deeds been as punitive as Roosevelt's were. The big banks aren't being broken up, the way they were in the 1930s. Bankers aren't being hauled off to jail. No serious effort has been made to rein in executive compensation -- or even to claw back millions of dollars in bonuses that were based on what turned out to be illusory profits. Most of the financial practices and products that brought us to the brink remain legal under the new Dodd-Frank legislation -- though they will, finally, be regulated. All things considered, Wall Street has gotten off pretty easy.
Not surprisingly, Mr. Scaramucci didn't see it that way. To his way of thinking, all of Wall Street was being blamed for the actions of a few bad apples. ''You have 500 to 1,000 rogues on Wall Street,'' he said. ''They were the ones who did counterproductive things to the society. There were 25 guys at A.I.G. who blew up the whole company. It was a very small number. They were the devil on Wall Street. My assistant works on Wall Street. She's not the devil. I just met with 50 brokers. They're not the devil. When the president says 'all these fat cats,' he is hurting all of Wall Street.''
What about his old firm, Goldman Sachs? I asked. Didn't they do things they shouldn't have? ''They probably did,'' he replied, but then quickly reverted to his previous theory. ''There are probably some bad people at Goldman,'' he said. ''But it would be very bad if the government took out Goldman Sachs. Goldman is the American dream factory. They can move people from the lower middle class to the ultra rich in one generation.'' Therefore, he believed, Goldman should be praised, not scorned.
And so it went. Greed, Mr. Scaramucci conceded, had infected Wall Street during the years leading up to the crisis -- but he wouldn't acknowledge what seems patently obvious to most people: that those who gravitate to Wall Street are far less motivated by a desire to, say, supply capital to struggling start-ups than to get really rich. (He's even written a high-minded book about all the good one can do on Wall Street, titled ''Goodbye Gordon Gekko.'')
Wall Street had become such an important part of the economy, he insisted, that when the president went after it, he was hurting the entire country. ''The president could have said that there are a lot of good people on Wall Street,'' he said.
What was most striking to me was Mr. Scaramucci's utter refusal to accept the notion that something truly systemic had infected the financial industry during the bubble years. It was as if all the bad things that had happened -- the predatory practices of the subprime lenders, the corruption of the ratings agencies, the laundering of risky mortgages into triple-A securities that were then foisted on unsuspecting investors and all the rest of it --were anomalies that had taken place in some little corner of Wall Street, while everyone else on the Street was busy financing companies and doing other good things. Although Mr. Scaramucci seemed to me to be an intelligent and well-meaning man -- with a stream-of-consciousness speaking style that made for an engaging hour -- he also seemed to me to be in denial. Just like the rest of Wall Street.
A few hours after I spoke to Mr. Scaramucci, I went to see a screening of a new documentary about the financial crisis, ''Inside Job.'' (It opens next week.) Written and directed by Charles Ferguson, beautifully shot and jazzily edited, it is a film whose premise could not be more different from Mr. Scaramucci's. Bad apples? Mr. Ferguson is firmly convinced that all of Wall Street was rotten to its core. ''An out-of-control industry,'' he calls it in the film.
Mr. Ferguson's rhetoric gets a little overheated for my taste; at several points in the film he bizarrely stops to dwell on the supposed penchant of Wall Street traders for consorting with prostitutes. But what he does brilliantly is paint a compelling picture of systemic abuse.
Here is Wall Street actively encouraging subprime lenders to lower their already low standards -- and then buying those loans knowing they are likely to default, but not caring. Here are traders up and down Wall Street making millions in bonuses selling products that are, in Mr. Ferguson's words, ''ticking time bombs.'' Here is Moody's, one of the three big credit ratings agency, quadrupling its profits in seven years by handing out triple-A ratings like candy. Here are the regulators, ignoring impassioned entreaties to investigate fraudulent lending practices and excessive leverage. These were not anomalies. This was standard operating procedure in the years before the crisis. ''It was a great big global Ponzi scheme,'' Martin Wolf, The Financial Times columnist, tells Mr. Ferguson.
Mr. Ferguson is merciless in evaluating the Obama administration's response to Wall Street's abuses. He thinks the government has done far too little to punish Wall Street and rein in its excesses. And though I think this is another place where his rhetorical excesses get the best of him, there is little doubt that his view is going to make his film very popular this fall. He is preaching to the converted.
The main thing I thought as I left the theater, though, was that I hoped Mr. Scaramucci would take the time to see it. He won't like it, of course, but maybe it's the thing he needs to rouse him from his state of denial. Maybe it can help all of Wall Street understand why the American people have no sympathy for its supposed plight.
At a minimum, Mr. Scaramucci will finally understand why Wall Street is going to remain a pinata for a very long time.

HEADLINE: After 17 Years, Russia Resolves U.S. Objections for Entry Into W.T.O.

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- Russia's finance minister said Friday that his country had resolved outstanding trade disagreements with the United States that had been holding up Russian membership in the World Trade Organization. Russia has sought entry to the W.T.O. since soon after the breakup of the Soviet Union.
An agreement would wrap up 17 years of negotiations on issues ranging from frozen chicken to intellectual property, and move Russia, now the largest country outside the W.T.O., a big step closer to joining. 
While American backing would not ensure Russia's entry, Washington's opposition would make it impossible. ''Today, I can say that with the U.S. we have settled all issues related to Russia's accession to the W.T.O.,'' Russia's finance minister, Aleksei L. Kudrin, said in comments carried by Russian news agencies from a conference in Yalta, in Ukraine.
Mr. Kudrin said a formal bid to join the trade body would be ready in two to four months. Russia could join from six months to a year after that, he said.
Later Friday, after President Dmitri A. Medvedev and President Obama talked by phone, the Russian presidential press service confirmed that substantial progress had been made, but stopped short of saying a final deal had been reached.
The White House issued a statement Friday acknowledging ''the substantial progress that Russia and the United States have made in completing negotiations.'' It said that President Obama ''pledged to support Russia's efforts to complete remaining steps in multilateral negotiations so that Russia could join the W.T.O. as soon as possible.''
The administration's apparent willingness to help usher Russia into the W.T.O. would be another touchstone in a wider give-and-take on matters of world import between Russia and the United States, under an administration policy known as the reset.
President Medvedev, for example, recently compromised on longstanding Russian policy toward Iran, putting on indefinite hold a major antiaircraft missile sale to that country that the United States had opposed.
But membership in the W.T.O. is still not certain for Russia, which has had thorny trade relations with several countries. There have repeatedly been false starts in Russia's membership bid over the years.
The Russians have been bargaining for entry longer than any country ever, including China, which was admitted in 2001.
Under the rules of the W.T.O., which sets standards for customs and tariffs policies, Russia must now turn its attention to smaller trading partners like Georgia. It is already in the W.T.O., has veto power, and has been subjected to a de facto Russian embargo on wine, produce and mineral water for years.
Several Russian trade disputes with the United States festered, too. Russia's accession was eased by new regulations adopted here on intellectual property rights, including protections for patented pharmaceuticals.
For the deal to close, Washington and Moscow also had to settle disputes on trade rules for Russian state companies, agricultural subsidies and inspection procedures for frozen chicken parts, a major headache for negotiators and an emotional issue here.
The United States began bulk exports of chicken to Russia as food aid in the early 1990s; the frozen thighs became known as ''Bush legs,'' after the first President Bush.
Russia, which for a time became the largest importer of American chicken, has since periodically blocked that trade, ostensibly for health reasons. In the meantime, the Russians have built a robust local poultry industry.
If Russia joins the W.T.O., the United States will be compelled to repeal a cold war-era trade restriction that was intended to encourage the Soviet Union to allow Jewish emigration. Though emigration controls fell away with the collapse of Communism, the United States had kept the law on the books as leverage over disputes like the chicken fight. But that law would violate W.T.O. rules if Russia were a member.
American diplomats have said they will seek to repeal this rule, the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, and grant Russia permanent favored trade status that would become effective upon Russia's entry in the W.T.O. But many in Washington say that Congressional repeal is not assured.

HEADLINE: Back to the Past

 BODY:
President Obama's call for sweeping changes in the space program got mugged by lobbyists and pork-minded legislators. An authorization bill for NASA -- the National Aeronautics and Space Administration -- that cleared Congress will leave the agency mired in past technologies. 
Mr. Obama shocked Congress and the space industry when he announced plans to abandon the Bush administration's goal of landing astronauts on the Moon by 2020 and terminate development of the rockets and crew capsules needed to get there. Instead, he proposed to rely on commercial companies to carry astronauts and cargo to the International Space Station orbit and called on NASA to develop ''game-changing'' technologies to make travel to more distant destinations -- asteroids and eventually Mars -- cheaper and faster.
That made good sense to us as a way to focus NASA on truly venturesome projects while leaving more mundane chores to private companies.
The bill, which the president is expected to sign and NASA claims to be grateful for, cancels most of the expensive Constellation program that was developing rockets and capsules to establish a base on the Moon. But it orders NASA to develop and fly a new heavy-lift rocket by the end of 2016. The only way to make that deadline (and follow detailed instructions in a Senate report) is by using technologies from existing programs, hardly ''game-changing.''
There is money for research on future space technologies but far less than the president sought. The bill also authorizes an extra shuttle flight beyond those already planned but fails to say where the $500 million to pay for the flight will come from, increasing the risk other NASA programs will be cannibalized.
A primary goal of those who drafted the legislation was to provide money and save jobs at existing NASA centers and their contractors. At a time of high unemployment, it's hard to argue with that impulse. But the result will be to postpone -- possibly for decades -- the development of the new technologies that could revolutionize long-distance space travel.

HEADLINE: Joblessness, in Theory and in Practice

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''Structure of Excuses'' (column, Sept. 27), Paul Krugman is certainly correct in pointing out that there is no evidence whatsoever that high unemployment is a result of companies' inability to find qualified workers.
However, he is wrong to say that ''all the facts suggest that high unemployment in America is the result of inadequate demand -- full stop.'' This ignores the fact that United States demand far exceeds United States production, and the jobs, wages and tax revenues production creates. Indeed, just since 2000, demand has exceeded production by $6 trillion, with net foreign-made imports (and borrowing) making up the difference. 
The Commerce Department points out that the worsening trade deficit in the second quarter of 2010 (the excess of demand over production) slashed the rate of economic growth by two-thirds -- from a strong, job-creating 5 percent rate down to just 1.6 percent.
The awful global economic realities for America are now the third rail of serious policy discussion, and that is a key to the Tea Party and other dangerous nonsense.
Charles W. McMillion Washington, Sept. 28, 2010
The writer is president and chief economist of MBG Information Services.
To the Editor:
Paul Krugman explains that structural unemployment isn't a real problem -- it's an excuse from the right to ignore a deficiency in demand.
The doomsayers of the 1930s who feared that employment was structural were proved wrong, he says, by the employment that arose from stimulus to the defense industry.
That situation is in no way analogous to the current one. Our economy is now heavily geared toward the service sector. The jobs most easily created by government stimulus, like those in defense or construction, are no longer suited to a majority of the members of the work force.
This means that stimulus would likely lead to a skills mismatch. Demand deficiency is a problem, but it is not the only one.
Ross Masood London, Sept. 27, 2010
To the Editor:
There clearly are a wealth of jobs that many Americans snub but that others are all too happy to take on. That is why we are grappling with enormous immigration problems.
If it is not reasonably profitable for American employers to make these jobs reasonably attractive to Americans, then each side needs to meet halfway to make things work, putting aside very short-term considerations that seem to be driving both American employers and potential employees.
Terry Weitzen Highland Park, N.J., Sept. 28, 2010
Helping in Chicago
To the Editor:
''For the Unemployed Over 50, Fears of Never Working Again'' (''The New Poor'' series, front page, Sept. 20) highlighted a problem that much of the nation is facing. But in Chicago, we have carried out a program to help put these people back to work.
After realizing last year that there were virtually no public programs serving the large number of unemployed Chicagoans who previously held middle-income jobs, we created Chicago Career Tech.
We worked with more than 100 corporate, higher education and nonprofit partners to build a six-month program that prepares unemployed, middle-income Chicagoans for technology-based careers by providing classroom and hands-on training in an array of in-demand technology fields. Participants earn a stipend and receive unemployment benefits, while gaining vital career and professional development skills.
Members of C.C.T.'s first class of 150 participants began training in May. They come from all across Chicago and from all walks of life. Approximately one-third of them are over age 50. They are educated and highly talented. And in response to demand, C.C.T.'s second class will expand to accommodate 325 participants in October.
Our goal is to retrain 2,100 professionals over the next three years, allowing them to once again become confident contributors to their families and to Chicago's economy.
Richard M. Daley Mayor Chicago, Sept. 29, 2010

HEADLINE: Closer Look at Rift Between Humanists Reveals Deeper Divisions

BYLINE: By MARK OPPENHEIMER. 
E-mail: mark.oppenheimer@nytimes.com

 BODY:
AMHERST, N.Y. -- You can tell something about a man by what he names his dog. At Paul Kurtz's house, I was greeted in his driveway by a pug puppy named John Dewey. The dog's predecessors, I learned, included Voltaire and Bentham.
Mr. Kurtz, an 84-year-old who names his dogs for free thinkers throughout history, is the exiled founder of the Center for Inquiry, which is devoted to promoting humanism and criticizing religion. He founded the center's two affiliates: the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, which investigates claims of the paranormal, like U.F.O. sightings and mental telepathy, and the Council for Secular Humanism, which promotes ethics and values without God. 
And he started two magazines and a publishing house, Prometheus Books.
There are more famous opponents of supernaturalism, but none is an institution-builder like Mr. Kurtz, a retired philosophy professor. The Center for Inquiry, which assumed its name in 1991, until recently shared a budget of more than $6 million with its affiliates, and it supports campus groups, a West Coast office and branches in many American cities and in countries like England, Peru and Poland.
Which makes Mr. Kurtz's fall Lear-like.
We are meeting in his home, not at the center, minutes away in this Buffalo suburb. In 2008, looking to spend less time running the center, he supported his board's decision to hire Ronald A. Lindsay, a corporate lawyer from Washington, as chief executive. He soon regretted the decision. Mr. Lindsay ''became very authoritarian and dictatorial,'' Mr. Kurtz told me.
In June 2009, at odds with Mr. Lindsay, Mr. Kurtz was voted out as the center's chairman. In May, he resigned from the board altogether.
According to Mr. Kurtz, there were two areas of conflict. First, he says, Mr. Lindsay changed the work culture. Whereas Mr. Kurtz had managed ''in the spirit of a think tank,'' Mr. Lindsay brought his legal background to bear.
''I am used to the academic life, where we don't impose rules on employees,'' Mr. Kurtz said, sitting in his living room. But Mr. Lindsay, he said, ''set up a command system, said these are the rules and laws, and anyone who deviates from that will be investigated.''
Employees were interrogated for minor infractions, Mr. Kurtz said, and several were let go. ''That is like Stalinism or the Inquisition,'' Mr. Kurtz said.
By phone and by e-mail, Mr. Lindsay said that the ''investigations'' were due-process inquiries into complaints, and that he had not fired anyone for questioning his authority. He said that four employees were laid off for economic reasons, one resigned, and one freelance employee did not have his contract renewed. Only the center's spokesman, Nathan Bupp, who left last week, may have been fired; Mr. Lindsay, in an e-mail, would only say, ''This was not a layoff.''
More generally, he said that Mr. Kurtz, after 30 years of leadership, simply found it too difficult to cede responsibility; in particular, Mr. Lindsay mentioned fund-raising, saying that Mr. Kurtz was reluctant to introduce him to donors he had known for years.
But Mr. Kurtz's second complaint goes beyond internecine power struggles. He said that Mr. Lindsay was turning the center away from Mr. Kurtz's humanist philosophy and toward negative, angry atheism.
According to Mr. Kurtz, skeptics must do more than just deride religion. ''If religion is being weakened, what replaces it in secular society?'' he asked. ''Most of my colleagues are concerned with critiquing the concept of God. That is important, but equally important is, where do you turn?''
In books like ''What Is Secular Humanism?'' Mr. Kurtz has argued for a universal but nonreligious ethics, one he now calls ''planetary humanism.'' Its first principle is that ''every person on the planet should be considered equal in dignity and value.'' In his books, he explains how this principle can be derived from nature and from what we know of the human species.
And he contrasted his affirmative vision with recent projects under Mr. Lindsay, like International Blasphemy Day. (The 2010 version, held Thursday, was renamed International Blasphemy Rights Day.) Mr. Kurtz was also a vocal critic of a contest for cartoons about religion that included some entries that could be considered deeply offensive.
''Angry atheism does not work,'' Mr. Kurtz said. ''It has to be friendly, cooperative relations with people of other points of view.'' To that end, he and several former employees of the center are starting a new organization, the Institute for Science and Human Values.
Does Mr. Lindsay really have a different vision for the Center for Inquiry? Is it hard-line atheism versus a more positive humanism? Mr. Lindsay and the employees who remain dispute Mr. Kurtz's portrayal of them as angry atheists. In a blog post, Mr. Lindsay defended the day of blasphemy as a reminder that the right to blaspheme is curtailed in much of the world and so ''remains a live issue for anyone concerned about human rights.'' And he countered that magazines run by Mr. Kurtz had long published cartoons critical of religion.
The center's donations have fallen since Mr. Kurtz's departure, which prompted warring blog posts between his defenders and Mr. Lindsay's. Matters have not improved: on Wednesday, when Mr. Kurtz stopped by the center, where he still keeps an office, he found the locks had been changed. Mr. Lindsay told me that Mr. Kurtz did not need the new key because he ''has no connection with us.''
Next: In Los Angeles, taking stock of atheism's future.

HEADLINE: Construction Spending Rises on Jump in Government Building

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Economic reports released Friday offered the latest data points for an economy that was sputtering along.
The Commerce Department reported that construction spending rose in August as a big jump in government building projects offset further weakness in the private sector. 
And the latest survey by the Institute for Supply Managementshowed that manufacturing dropped to 54.4 percent in September from 56.3 percent in August. Economists surveyed by Reuters was for a reading of 54.5. Still, any number above 50 indicates an expansion.
Strong growth in the industrial sector has helped lift the country out of the recession. Last month's report was better than expected and was a factor in Wall Street's September rally.
In addition Friday, consumer spending and income rose as did consumer sentiment. The survey of consumer sentiment by the Thomson Reuters and the University of Michigan fell to 68.2 from 68.9 in August. Economists had expected a reading of 67.
The gains in construction spending in August came in government projects, the Commerce Department said. The weakness in construction activity has been a major drag on the overall economy
Overall, construction spending edged up 0.4 percent in August after 1.4 percent drop in July. While spending on government projects rose 2.5 percent, spending on private construction projects dropped to the lowest level in 12 years.
Consumer spending rose by a moderate amount in August while incomes increased by the largest amount in eight months, a gain that was propelled by the resumption of extended unemployment benefits.
The Commerce Department said Friday that spending increased 0.4 percent in August, matching the July increase. The two increases followed June's flat reading on consumer spending.
Incomes were up 0.5 percent, better than a 0.2 percent rise in July and a flat reading in June.
More spending and increased income is helping to sustain the economy, which is growing at a slow rate.
Consumer spending accounts for 70 percent of total economic activity in the United States and until it returns to a stronger pace, the rebound from the recession will be held back. But spending is not likely to see a big gain until income growth accelerates.
The August rise in incomes would have been much lower -- just 0.2 percent -- without the extended unemployment benefits. The program had temporarily lapsed in July after Republicans blocked an extension. That lowered incomes in the July report by about $17 billion at an annual rate.
The jobless benefits program resumed in August and that lifted incomes in the August report by approximately $21 billion.
The two consecutive months of 0.4 percent gains in spending bolstered confidence that the country is not slipping back into a recession, fears that had been fueled by flat readings on spending in both April and June.
With incomes up slightly more than spending, the personal savings rate edged up to 5.8 percent of after-tax incomes in August. It was 5.7 percent in July. Both are much higher than the 2.1 percent average for the savings rate in 2007, before the recession began.
A crucial gauge of inflation tied to consumer spending showed prices rose a slight 0.2 percent in August. Excluding food and energy, prices were up 0.1 percent. This price gauge is up 1.4 percent excluding food and energy over the past year, indicating that the weak economy has essentially banished inflation as a threat at the moment.

HEADLINE: Third Party Rising

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
A friend in the U.S. military sent me an e-mail last week with a quote from the historian Lewis Mumford's book, ''The Condition of Man,'' about the development of civilization. Mumford was describing Rome's decline: ''Everyone aimed at security: no one accepted responsibility. What was plainly lacking, long before the barbarian invasions had done their work, long before economic dislocations became serious, was an inner go. Rome's life was now an imitation of life: a mere holding on. Security was the watchword -- as if life knew any other stability than through constant change, or any form of security except through a constant willingness to take risks.''
It was one of those history passages that echo so loudly in the present that it sends a shiver down my spine -- way, way too close for comfort. 
I've just spent a week in Silicon Valley, talking with technologists from Apple, Twitter, LinkedIn, Intel, Cisco and SRI and can definitively report that this region has not lost its ''inner go.'' But in talks here and elsewhere I continue to be astounded by the level of disgust with Washington, D.C., and our two-party system -- so much so that I am ready to hazard a prediction: Barring a transformation of the Democratic and Republican Parties, there is going to be a serious third party candidate in 2012, with a serious political movement behind him or her -- one definitely big enough to impact the election's outcome.
There is a revolution brewing in the country, and it is not just on the right wing but in the radical center. I know of at least two serious groups, one on the East Coast and one on the West Coast, developing ''third parties'' to challenge our stagnating two-party duopoly that has been presiding over our nation's steady incremental decline.
President Obama has not been a do-nothing failure. He has some real accomplishments. He passed a health care expansion, a financial regulation expansion, stabilized the economy, started a national education reform initiative and has conducted a smart and tough war on Al Qaeda.
But there is another angle on the last two years: a president who won a sweeping political mandate, propelled by an energized youth movement and with control of both the House and the Senate -- about as much power as any president could ever hope to muster in peacetime -- was only able to pass an expansion of health care that is a suboptimal amalgam of tortured compromises that no one is certain will work or that we can afford (and doesn't deal with the cost or quality problems), a limited stimulus that has not relieved unemployment or fixed our infrastructure, and a financial regulation bill that still needs to be interpreted by regulators because no one could agree on crucial provisions. Plus, Obama had to abandon an energy-climate bill altogether, and if the G.O.P. takes back the House, we may not have an energy bill until 2013.
Obama probably did the best he could do, and that's the point. The best our current two parties can produce today -- in the wake of the worst existential crisis in our economy and environment in a century -- is suboptimal, even when one party had a huge majority. Suboptimal is O.K. for ordinary times, but these are not ordinary times. We need to stop waiting for Superman and start building a superconsensus to do the superhard stuff we must do now. Pretty good is not even close to good enough today.
''We basically have two bankrupt parties bankrupting the country,'' said the Stanford University political scientist Larry Diamond. Indeed, our two-party system is ossified; it lacks integrity and creativity and any sense of courage or high-aspiration in confronting our problems. We simply will not be able to do the things we need to do as a country to move forward ''with all the vested interests that have accrued around these two parties,'' added Diamond. ''They cannot think about the overall public good and the longer term anymore because both parties are trapped in short-term, zero-sum calculations,'' where each one's gains are seen as the other's losses.
We have to rip open this two-party duopoly and have it challenged by a serious third party that will talk about education reform, without worrying about offending unions; financial reform, without worrying about losing donations from Wall Street; corporate tax reductions to stimulate jobs, without worrying about offending the far left; energy and climate reform, without worrying about offending the far right and coal-state Democrats; and proper health care reform, without worrying about offending insurers and drug companies.
''If competition is good for our economy,'' asks Diamond, ''why isn't it good for our politics?''
We need a third party on the stage of the next presidential debate to look Americans in the eye and say: ''These two parties are lying to you. They can't tell you the truth because they are each trapped in decades of special interests. I am not going to tell you what you want to hear. I am going to tell you what you need to hear if we want to be the world's leaders, not the new Romans.''

HEADLINE: At the Y, 'They Take Care of Each Other'

BYLINE: By ISOLDE RAFTERY

 BODY:
VALERIE BERGER was nearly 60 but had never had her own place. She split her time between her mother's house and her boyfriend's apartment, both in Park Slope, Brooklyn. Then her boyfriend died of a surgery-related infection at age 70, a few years after her mother did. Unable to afford much else, Ms. Berger moved in April 2009 into the Y.W.C.A. in Brooklyn, where she pays $625 a month -- including utilities -- for her 8-foot-by-12-foot room (a phone, with voicemail, costs $15 extra).
Ms. Berger is among more than 200 women who call the Y.W.C.A. home. Founded in 1888, the Y moved in 1927 to an 11-story building on Third Avenue in Boerum Hill, where the top five floors have provided generations of women a place to pause at a rough time in life; some have stayed, it seems, forever. 
Women of all stripes have walked these echoing hallways: Alvin Ailey dancers, electrical engineers, former prisoners, retired teachers and an actress on the HBO series ''The Wire.'' About a dozen of the current residents have been here since the 1950s or '60s, including one woman who came to the Y directly after aging out of foster care.
''They take care of each other,'' said Martha Kamber, the executive director of the Y.W.C.A. since 2006. ''The younger women take care of the older women. They created this themselves.''
The year before Ms. Kamber took over the organization, which was struggling financially, developers offered the Y.W.C.A. $25 million for the building. The board of directors refused; where would the residents go? But that left Ms. Kamber to raise $8 million in less than a year or risk losing the building. She went further, presiding over a $26 million, four-year renovation, tearing out the gym and replacing it with 84 studio apartments for poor or abused women. She also asked lawyers renting office space to leave, replacing them with nonprofit groups, and upgraded the heating system, replaced the windows and installed energy-saving showerheads to make the place more environmentally friendly.
As for Ms. Berger, she has taken advantage of free exercise classes and has made new friends. In her room, on the 11th floor, she arranged on her single bed four throw pillows -- encased in bright fabrics and emblazoned with curlicue stitching -- that had been in storage .''These are the ones I first got,'' she said, pointing out the green and turquoise pillows. ''The ones I couldn't use because I had no place.''

HEADLINE: Refinancing Into Shorter Loans

BYLINE: By LYNNLEY BROWNING

 BODY:
GRIM headlines about the housing market can make that final mortgage payment seem like a distant dream. But a growing number of homeowners are refinancing into shorter-term mortgages designed to make the dream become a reality sooner.
Mortgages that last 15 years, rather than the gold standard of 30 years, have grown popular in recent months -- a counterpoint to the foreclosures, ''underwater'' nightmares and aversion to debt.
With interest rates at or near their lowest levels in decades, ''we are seeing a lot more interest in refinancing into short-term mortgages,'' said Melissa L. Cohn, the chief executive of the Manhattan Mortgage Company. ''It's people who are established in their residences and are not going to be moving and are comfortable in their income stream.'' 
Tom Kelly, a spokesman for JPMorgan Chase, said his bank saw similar activity, adding that customers were ''shortening their mortgage while often barely increasing their payments.''
With a shorter-term mortgage, more of your payments go toward the principal, so you cut interest costs significantly, typically by tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars. While 15-year loans are the most popular shorter-term product, use of 10- and 20-year loans has also spiked.
By erasing your mortgage debt faster, you remove a major financial stressor by the time retirement or children's college tuition rolls around. And you build up equity in your house quickly, instead of hoping the market will later rise and do that for you.
''It's the higher-end people doing it, like somebody who makes $250,000 a year or more,'' said Roberto Lupi, the chief executive of the Residential Home Funding Corporation, a mortgage broker in Parsippany, N.J. ''It's older, secure types, people who want to go into retirement with a clean slate.''
The downside, of course, is that you are locked into higher monthly payments. So if job insecurity or a cash crunch is looming, it may not be a good idea. Some homeowners think it's prudent to keep the flexibility of a 30-year mortgage, but build up equity by making extra payments.
Still, over the first seven months of this year, one in four homeowners chose to refinance into a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage over the 30-year alternative, according to Corelogic, a financial data company based in Santa Ana, Calif. That was a big increase from 2007, when fewer than 1 in 10 did. Over the same period, 1 in 20 bought a house with a 15-year loan, versus 1 in 28 in 2007.
The rates on 15-year loans typically hover around half a percentage point lower than those on 30-year loans. In previous years, when rates were several percentage points higher, that seemingly small gap translated into relatively higher monthly payments for a 15-year loan.
For example, if you took out a 30-year loan on a $400,000 house in August 2004, when rates averaged 5.87 percent, according to Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored enterprise, you pay just over $2,364 a month in principal and interest. A 15-year fixed-rate loan, at an average 5.26 percent, would have cost over $3,217 -- a difference of $853.
Closing costs are about the same as for a 30-year loan -- this year, an average $3,741 on a $200,000 loan, according to Bankrate.com, a financial data firm.
BUT if you refinanced that 2004 30-year loan in August, you would feel less pain from the difference. Assuming your house is still worth $400,000, you would need to refinance only $364,870. A 15-year fixed-rate loan in August, at the average 3.91 percent, would cost $2,682. In other words, you would now pay a gentler $535 more a month - a savings of $318 on the 2004 scenario.
''I actually do a lot of 15-years where the monthly payment is only $250 or $300 higher than what people were paying on their 30-years,'' said Christopher Aniskovich, the founder of the Security Financial Mortgage Corporation, a broker in Branford, Conn.

HEADLINE: The Survival Of the Safest

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. SHILLER. 
Robert J. Shiller is professor of economics and finance at Yale and co-founder and chief economist of MacroMarkets LLC.

 BODY:
CORPORATE managers struggling to preserve their companies and protect their core employees have inadvertently contributed to a vicious cycle of rising unemployment and plummeting national morale. If we are to break out of this downward spiral, we first need to understand the problem, then deal with it on a huge scale.
It's no surprise that business confidence has been shaken over the last few years. Executives are unwilling to take on new risks, and people in all walks of life are nervous about trusting in one another. In a broad sense, damage to morale -- which John Maynard Keynes called ''animal spirits'' -- surely ranks as one of the most important reasons for the American economy's persistent weakness. 
Yet professional managers throughout the business world see it as their job to keep work-force morale high. But, paradoxically, the actions they take for their own workplaces often make the overall crisis more severe.
A remarkable book by Truman Bewley, titled ''Why Wages Don't Fall During a Recession'' (Harvard, 1999), provides insights into the current situation, even though it focuses on the recession of 1990-91 and the long ''jobless recovery'' that followed it.
The title derives from a puzzle that has troubled economists for more than a century: Why doesn't the labor market ''clear''? If demand falls in markets for other productive factors -- say, wheat as an ingredient in the baking of bread -- the price usually drops until the excess supply is mostly gone. What is unusual about the market for labor is that excess supply, which shows up as unemployment, can be prominent and persistent.
Why? In short, the difference is morale. Factors of production like wheat or trucks or pumps don't have morale issues. Human beings do.
How these issues affect the labor market is a major focus of the research of Professor Bewley, who is a colleague of mine at Yale. He has developed an idiosyncratic approach, interviewing hundreds of corporate managers at length about the driving forces for their actions. The managers consistently told him that they are concerned about the emotional state of their core employees. They said that their companies' continued success depends on the positive feelings and loyalty of these workers -- and lamented the hard choices that would need to be made in a severe downturn.
Keeping all employees relatively idle while reducing their pay or cutting their working hours will hurt everyone. Managers say they usually consider it better to protect the crucial workers -- and to engage in sudden mass layoffs of others. The idea is to clear out the less essential people at once, ushering them out the door quickly so their complaining doesn't spoil the atmosphere. Then managers can make sure that remaining employees receive their full wages and can pay their household bills.
''Losing a job is close to a death in the family,'' one manager said. But in a tough economy, when managers view the very survival of their enterprise as in jeopardy, they steel themselves against sentimentality, believing that layoffs are needed to keep the business going with their most loyal and effective people.
UNEMPLOYMENT, in this context, is like battlefield triage, leaving some severely injured soldiers to die so that medics can keep as many as possible in fighting condition. But, of course, such a harsh practice may not contribute to the best morale among those chosen to survive.
Unfortunately, managers often lay off more people than necessary, to ensure that they don't have to repeat the ordeal anytime soon. The remaining workers must work harder, taking on some of the work of their missing colleagues, and productivity rises. (The economy today shows both increasing productivity and increasing corporate profits.)
Those relegated to unemployment can't directly ''poison the atmosphere'' in their former workplaces. But they remain friends and neighbors of the employed, and their anger and distress, repeated in thousands of communities, contribute to a poisoning of the atmosphere of the entire nation.
Moreover, managers interviewed by Professor Bewley in the 1990s said that employees who hold onto jobs often suffer ''survivors' guilt.'' They are genuinely pained, experiencing empathy with the less fortunate. In this troubled state, they don't think about taking extravagant vacations, or buying new houses or fancy new cars. And this frugality detracts from demand that might produce jobs for others.
Similar thinking underlies the relatively low level of business expenditures today on buildings, equipment and software. Lower-level managers won't ask for scarce resources for such things, because those items look like luxuries to fellow employees, who worry that there won't be enough in the company budget for them to keep their jobs.
One top manager told Professor Bewley that he had to compensate for the reticence of lower-level managers, who won't ask for anything. ''I tell them to put in a few dreams for equipment they would like, because if they don't try, they'll never get what they want,'' this manager said.
Of course, while that reticence may preserve jobs in one's own company, it works against job growth elsewhere. A result is a loss of vigor in the aggregate economy, and the sapping of the very kind of creativity that might spur a recovery.
Professor Bewley shared with me a passage from an interview in July with a manager of a large manufacturing company. ''There is more uncertainty, and everybody is afraid,'' this manager told him. ''Do your job. Keep employed. Don't come up with a new idea.'' In his own company, the manager said, ''Everybody is doing the same thing.''
Sometimes the private sector needs help from the government, and this is one of those times. We need to break the cycle of protracted unemployment and sagging morale through big government programs to create millions of jobs.

HEADLINE: Israeli Soul Food

BYLINE: By EMILY DeNITTO

 BODY:
Westchester's food scene has grown more diverse and interesting in recent years, and there is no need to travel to the city for most culinary fixes. But one exception has remained for much of the county: Middle Eastern street food. 
Now a river town has come to the rescue with the terrific Taiim Falafel Shack, a sunny, pleasant little spot offering delicious Israeli soul food for takeout (or eat-in -- there are three small tables and a counter with seating for 15 or so). Opened in July by Kerri Jew and Zamir Iosepovici, an Israeli who is an owner of a Middle Eastern restaurant in Highland Park, N.J., Taiim, which means ''delicious'' in Hebrew, is serving up falafels, shawarmas, baba ghanouj and more.
All the items are made fresh in-house, including the lemony tahini, simple salad dressings and crispy baklava. The chickpeas for the falafels are soaked overnight, not canned, and many of the hard-to-find ingredients are purchased from Arab markets in Paterson, N.J.
Ms. Jew and Mr. Iosepovici live in Hastings, and they were frustrated by the lack of healthy, kid-friendly takeout options. ''We'll deconstruct sandwiches for kids, or hold back on spices if it helps parents,'' Ms. Jew said. ''We want to make it easier for working families to eat well.''
The prices are helpful in these tough economic times too: Sandwiches are $5 to $8; platters, $10 to $14; and sides, $4 to $10. You can order a Turkish coffee ($2.50) or imported Israeli juices ($1.75) in addition to the usual Snapples and sodas to complete the authentic Middle Eastern experience. B'te'avon!
Taiim Falafel Shack, 598 Warburton Avenue, Hastings-on-Hudson. (914) 478-0006; taiimfalafelshack.com. Open Monday, 4 to 8:30 p.m.; Tuesday through Saturday, 11:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.

HEADLINE: Liberal Groups Rally in Washington

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Tens of thousands of union members, environmentalists and peace activists rallied at the Lincoln Memorial on Saturday, seeking to carry on the message of jobs and justice that the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. trumpeted at a rally at the same site 47 years ago.
More than 300 groups organized Saturday's march to build momentum for progressive causes like increased job-creation programs and to mobilize liberal voters to flock to the polls next month. 
The rally's sponsors, including the N.A.A.C.P., the A.F.L.-C.I.O., the Sierra Club and the National Council of La Raza, said they also hoped to demonstrate that they, not the Tea Party, represented the nation's majority.
Organizers called the march ''One Nation Working Together,'' saying they hoped it would be an answer and antidote to what they called the divisiveness of the Tea Party.
''We believe that by working together we can build abundance to lift up everyone,'' said Bob King, president of the United Auto Workers. ''We can't do that through divisiveness. We believe that we have to rebuild a social movement in America.''
The rally was held on a cloudless day, with American flags atop the Lincoln Memorial's stairs and a sea of yellow, red, blue and purple T-shirts stretching out below, worn by members of various civil rights, peace and union groups.
Demonstrators flew in from Los Angeles and Denver, took buses from Oklahoma and Tennessee, and carpooled from New York and Massachusetts.
They shouted ''Yes, we can!'' and carried signs saying ''We March for Hope Not Hate,'' and ''N.A.A.C.P. Says Tell the Senate More (Good) Jobs Now.''
''I think we're all here because we want our voices heard in Washington,'' said Beverly Webber, a recently retired accounting specialist for Alaska Airlines who flew in from Seattle. ''I want less defense spending and more spending on infrastructure and green jobs.''
Jerry Richards, a worker at a Chrysler plant, was carrying a sign saying ''Good Jobs Now,'' after having grabbed a seat on a caravan of nine buses that left Warren, Mich., at 9 p.m. Friday.
''Our forefathers fought against the English, and if you're not fighting for something, you're just sitting on your couch,'' Mr. Richards said. Standing alongside a close friend who has been unemployed for two years, he said his top issue was job creation.
Noting that they began planning their rally in April, organizers said they were not responding to a march organized by Glenn Beck, which drew enormous crowds to the front of the Lincoln Memorial on Aug. 28. But they acknowledged that their hope was to draw an even larger crowd to Saturday's event.
Significant areas of the National Mall that had been filled during Mr. Beck's rally were empty. In a broadcast on Thursday, Mr. Beck criticized the liberals' march, saying his supporters paid their own way to drive to Washington, while labor unions chartered hundreds of buses to ferry demonstrators to Saturday's rally.
Mr. Beck's rally resembled a religious revival, but Saturday's event was overwhelmingly a political and policy pep rally, although it largely avoided partisan language.
The march's organizers were heavily emphasizing on Saturday that they were seeking to energize voters to elect candidates they believed would do more to reduce unemployment and raise taxes on the richest Americans.
''Coming out of here, we've got to go home and ask our friends to vote and we've got to ask our neighbors to vote,'' Benjamin T. Jealous, president of the N.A.A.C.P., told the crowd.
Earlier in the day he said ''10-2-10,'' the shorthand for the Saturday march, ''is very much connected to 11-2-10,'' which is Election Day. ''We've come too far to turn back now,'' he said. ''We have to build momentum to create prosperity. Right now, a lot of Tea Party folks are pushing for tax cuts for the top 1 percent. We have to focus on jobs for the other 99 percent.''
On Thursday Mr. Beck warned that the march included Marxist, Communist and revolutionary groups. Among the organizations endorsing the march were the Communist Party USA, the United Church of Christ, Jewish Funds for Justice, the National Urban League, the National Baptist Convention, People for the American Way and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force.
''This is a big tent,'' Mr. Jealous said. ''Anyone who wants to stand up to create jobs and defend the jobs of teachers, police officers, nurses, firefighters -- I say come on and join us.''
He said the rally's sponsors welcomed groups that endorsed their goals, including a higher minimum wage, immigration reform, improved public education and an end to the wave of foreclosures. But he said that did not mean that the organizers agreed with all the policies of every group that endorsed the rally.
Sponsors said the rally was not vying with the ''Rally to Restore Sanity'' that Jon Stewart, the host of ''The Daily Show,'' has scheduled for Oct. 30 in Washington.
The Rev. Leah Daughtry, coordinator of Saturday's march, said the rallies shared many goals. ''We want to help make sure there is an energized and educated electorate,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Count On Sequels To TARP

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
THE government is pulling a sheet over TARP, the Troubled Asset Relief Program created during the panic of 2008 to bail out the nation's financial institutions. With the program's expiration on Sunday, we can expect to hear lots of claims from the folks at the Treasury that it was a great success.
Such assertions would be no surprise from a political class justifiably concerned about possible taxpayer unhappiness, the continuing economic turmoil and the midterm elections. But if we have learned anything during this crisis, it is that the proclamations emanating from the Washington spin machine must be taken with an extra-hefty grain of salt. 
Consider the claims made last summer that the Dodd-Frank financial reform act reduces the threats that large, interconnected banks pose to taxpayers and the economy when the banks are deemed too big to fail. Indeed, as regulators hammer out the rules governing derivatives transactions, it's evident that the law has created a new set of institutions that will almost certainly be deemed too important to fail if they ever get into trouble. And that means there won't really be an effective way to keep those firms from taking big, profitable, short-term risks that are dumped on the taxpayers when the bets fail.
Our roster of bailout candidates includes the clearinghouses, created under Dodd-Frank, that are meant to increase the oversight of derivatives trading. Because most derivatives transactions are expected to go through these clearinghouses, they will be ''systemically important'' under the law. As such, Dodd-Frank specifically provides that ''in unusual or exigent circumstances,'' the Federal Reserve may provide such entities with a financial backstop, including borrowing privileges.
Remember this: Financial backstop is just another term for a taxpayer bailout. And the major banks and brokerage firms are the members of the clearinghouses, so a backstop would essentially be for them.
According to the Bank for International Settlements, the entire derivatives market had a gross credit exposure of $3.5 trillion at the end of 2009. Obviously, even a small fraction of that amount could represent a sizable call on the taxpayers if a clearinghouse hit the skids.
So much for eradicating too-big-to-fail.
That's not to say there aren't upsides to clearinghouses. First and foremost, they will improve transparency in this huge market, requiring participants to disclose how much they have at stake financially. Regulators didn't have such reports in the recent crisis and were severely hampered by the fact that derivatives trading existed largely in a black box.
In times of trouble, clearinghouses also allow hobbled firms to unwind and quickly reassign their positions to other, healthier players. Another good thing.
But clearinghouses sometimes collapse, as Craig Pirrong, professor of finance at the University of Houston, points out.
''Clearinghouses are intimately connected with the financial system and overall banking system, so the idea that clearinghouses reduce the interconnectedness of the financial system is incorrect,'' he said. ''They are big, interconnected and they can fail when we have big market shocks.''
In the Gold Panic of 1869, which caused New York markets to seize up, the clearinghouse for the gold exchange failed. And in the 1987 stock market crash, members of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the Chicago Board of Trade and the Options Clearing Corporation received emergency infusions, Mr. Pirrong said.
''It's a dilemma,'' he added. ''On the one hand, it is very important that clearinghouses have the ability to get liquidity support in the time of a crisis. But if a clearinghouse is convinced that Ben is at my back, they might not be as prudent or cautious as they might otherwise be'' -- referring to Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chief.
Walker F. Todd, a lawyer and economic consultant in Chagrin Falls, Ohio, was assistant general counsel and research officer at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland from 1985 to 1994. He's also an expert on the widening financial safety net -- a net that offers taxpayer backstops for the institutions that got us into this mess and will most likely, alas, get us into the next one.
He says he is disturbed by the explicit backing of derivatives clearinghouses provided in Dodd-Frank. ''There is no reason whatsoever for exposing taxpayers and ordinary citizens to paying for the gaming losses incurred through over-the-counter derivatives,'' Mr. Todd said.
But with the backstop now firmly in place for clearinghouses, the Fed will be able to pay off derivatives players directly, rather than indirectly as it did in the disastrous rescue of the American International Group.
Given the multiple bailouts of 2008, it is to be expected that the line of institutions clamoring to join the cannot-fail party will grow longer. That's the definition of moral hazard -- if you rescue one group, others are sure to want the same treatment and behave in a way that ensures they'll get it. The losses that taxpayers may endure in the next debacle, meanwhile, mount higher.
''THE crisis is about loss redistribution,'' said Edward J. Kane, professor of finance at Boston College and an authority on regulatory failures. ''In a crisis, these institutions have much more power with the government than taxpayers do and they will make it seem in the interests of responsible officials to rescue them, whether that's Congress, the Treasury or the Federal Reserve. But the notion that you can always throw these losses on the taxpayer in the long run is very, very dangerous. There will come a time when the taxpayers will come close to revolt.''

HEADLINE: Claims to BP Fund Attract Scrutiny

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
Kenneth R. Feinberg spent part of his summer barnstorming towns near the Gulf of Mexico, urging people who felt they had suffered financial hardship because of the oil spill to apply for a share of the $20 billion BP fund he was overseeing. The point of the fund was to pay claims rather than litigate them in court.
''It's my opinion you are crazy if you don't participate,'' Mr. Feinberg told a crowd at one stop in Louisiana.
And participate they did. Mr. Feinberg has seen applications that could bring a tear to the eye. 
Others are likelier to raise eyebrows.
Take the businessman who explained that his part of the $20 billion fund should be ... $20 billion. His income last year? Fifty thousand dollars.
A restaurant worker asked for $5.9 million in emergency payments, even though his earnings before the spill were just $18,000.
And then there are the 4,000 claims, using a one-page form letter, that flooded in from Plaquemines Parish a couple of weeks ago, some hand delivered to local claims offices.
They asked for grocery money, from $150 a month to hundreds of dollars, to make up for the fish they would have pulled from the gulf waters had there been no spill. Few offered any substantiation for the claim, though one person brought a dead fish.
In all, about 31,000 claims have little or no documentation, and the people who filed them have been asked to provide more information. And 1,000 more are ''very, very suspicious,'' Mr. Feinberg said, and are being held for further examination.
''They're not just sitting there,'' he said. ''We can't pay them without more documentation -- minimal documentation, but enough to process the claim.''
Suspicious claims are perhaps inevitable whenever a big fund is set up after a natural disaster.
The National Center for Disaster Fraud, formed in Baton Rouge after Hurricane Katrina, has prosecuted more than 1,300 cases arising from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma and has begun to take in tips about the oil spill as well.
''When these disasters strike, sadly, some small group of people will act with criminal intent,'' said Lanny A. Breuer, the head of the criminal division at the Department of Justice. Jim Letten, the United States attorney in New Orleans and executive director of the fraud center, said the center had already received ''a little over 300'' calls to the tip line about spill fraud.
''Individuals who simply make honest mistakes in the application process do not have to fear criminal investigation or prosecution,'' Mr. Letten said. But investigators ''will actively pursue'' anyone who commits intentional fraud, he added.
The fund has paid out on thousands of claims it has decided are legitimate. So far, 45,298 checks worth $824 million have been sent since Mr. Feinberg took over on Aug. 23.
Some plaintiffs' lawyers are rankled by complaints about claims because they lack documentation. Stephen J. Herman, a New Orleans lawyer, called it ''kind of ironic'' to have Mr. Feinberg complaining about lack of documentation when he all but discouraged people from using lawyers to pursue their claims.
''If you'd had lawyers helping people fill out their claims forms, you'd probably have better documentation,'' he said.
The Feinberg team has handed nearly 100 of the most suspicious claims to private investigators for further inquiry, and has begun the process of sending those that seem the most likely to be fraudulent to the Department of Justice.
Those familiar with the internal workings of the process provided details of some of the more questionable claims on the condition that those submitting the claims not be identified.
Some boat owners have submitted pay stubs for far more deckhands than they would seem to need to operate their boats (the investigators do look into the size of the fishing boats).
There was the restaurant worker who declared that his income had dropped after the spill, but it turned out the restaurant had closed before the spill. There is the shrimper whose documents showed his earnings in the year before the spill had been $90,000, but whose claim hit $2,066,000.
The team is also taking a close look at a person who appears to have developed a side business filling out reimbursement forms that appear to be consistently inflated.
Others appear to be trying to defraud victims. A law firm in New Orleans alerted Mr. Feinberg to reports of their clients getting letters from people claiming to work with Mr. Feinberg, using fake stationery and requesting wire transfer information that can be used for electronic theft.
''The American people have to understand that this underground economy down there is real,'' Mr. Feinberg said. ''It's a real problem for us.''
Still, he added, some of what he sees -- in particular, the one-page grocery requests -- should not be thought of as serious fraud, but amount to ''just trying to game the system.''
''I don't want to chill people from applying,'' he said.
Billy Nungesser, the Plaquemines Parish president, called the grocery claims ''totally bogus,'' and suggested that the idea of submitting them was ''being circulated by some of the councilmen running for re-election.''
That kind of talk angers Don Beshel, a Plaquemines councilman and the signer of several hundred of the forms, which he insisted he worked out according to the rules of the fund.
''It's not up to me or anybody else who signed it to say the claim is valid or invalid or anything,'' he said. ''You can't validate me giving somebody fish to put in the freezer.''
John Barthelmy Jr., the principal of Phoenix High School in Plaquemines Parish, said he was surprised to find his name and various versions of the school's letterhead on a number of the submissions for groceries.
He acknowledged that he signed some of the forms, but said he assumed that the idea that they could be submitted came from within the fund itself and not from the people of the parish. ''We're not that creative in the gangster area, to come up with that on our own,'' he said.
Preventing fraud and ironing out the remaining kinks in the process will be increasingly important as the fund moves from the first stage of emergency claims to the second, more complicated process of negotiating final settlements with people over their total losses from the spill.
That will be a process of long negotiation with a deadline three years away so that some of the long-term effects can at least be glimpsed and better predicted.
To Mr. Feinberg, the fundamental problem with paying the wrong people -- it is not his money, after all -- is protecting the victims.
Give in to fraud, and ''the credibility of the program would collapse, the elected officials would scream, the American people would scream,'' he said. ''It would become a grab bag.''
''The money would go away,'' Mr. Feinberg said. ''The legitimate victims would suffer more as a result.''

HEADLINE: At Risk From The Womb

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
Some people think we're shaped primarily by genes. Others believe that the environment we grow up in is most important. But now evidence is mounting that a third factor is also critical: our uterine environment before we're even born.
Researchers are finding indications that obesity, diabetes and mental illness among adults are all related in part to what happened in the womb decades earlier. 
One of the first careful studies in this field found that birth weight (a proxy for nutrition in the womb) helped predict whether an adult would suffer from heart disease half a century later. Scrawny babies were much more likely to suffer heart problems in middle age.
That study, published in 1989, provoked skepticism at first. But now an array of research confirms that the fetal period is a crucial stage of development that affects physiology decades later.
Perhaps the most striking finding is that a stressful uterine environment may be a mechanism that allows poverty to replicate itself generation after generation. Pregnant women in low-income areas tend to be more exposed to anxiety, depression, chemicals and toxins from car exhaust to pesticides, and they're more likely to drink or smoke and less likely to take vitamin supplements, eat healthy food and get meticulous pre-natal care.
The result is children who start life at a disadvantage -- for kids facing stresses before birth appear to have lower educational attainment, lower incomes and worse health throughout their lives. If that's true, then even early childhood education may be a bit late as a way to break the cycles of poverty.
''Given the odds stacked against poor women and their fetuses, the most effective antipoverty program might be one that starts before birth,'' writes Annie Murphy Paul in a terrific and important new book called ''Origins: How the Nine Months Before Birth Shape the Rest of Our Lives.''
Another groundbreaking and provocative book this year makes the same case: ''More than Genes,'' by Dan Agin, a neuroscientist at the University of Chicago. Both offer a new window into the unexpected forces that shape us.
One study in this field, by a Columbia University economist, Douglas Almond, looked at children who were born after the great flu pandemic of 1918. The pandemic lasted only about five months and infected about a third of pregnant women in America, so Mr. Almond compared those who had been exposed to it while inside their mothers with others born just before or after.
Ms. Paul quotes Mr. Almond as concluding, ''People who were in utero during the pandemic did worse, on average, on just about every socioeconomic outcome recorded.'' They were 15 percent less likely to graduate from high school, 15 percent more likely to be poor, and 20 percent more likely to have heart disease in old age.
Stress in mothers seems to have particularly strong effects on their offspring, perhaps through release of cortisol, a hormone released when a person is anxious. Studies show that children who were in utero during the Arab-Israeli Six-Day War of 1967 were more likely to have schizophrenia diagnosed as adults. And The Journal of the American Medical Association reported that Chinese born during the terrible famine from 1959 to 1961 were twice as likely to develop schizophrenia as those born at other times.
As for obesity, Ms. Paul describes several British scientists who fed pregnant rats junk food: doughnuts, marshmallows, potato chips and chocolate chip muffins. The offspring of those rats turned out to have a sweet tooth as well: they were more likely to choose junk food when it was offered and ended up 25 percent fatter than rats whose mothers were fed regular rodent chow.
This field of ''fetal origins'' is still in its infancy, but one implication is that we should be much more careful about exposing pregnant women to toxins, and much quicker to regulate chemicals that are now widely used even though they've never even been tested for safety. Professor Agin is particularly eloquent about the potential perils of lead, dioxins, PCBs, radiation and pesticides.
One study looked at Swedish children who were fetuses during the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident. The radiation exposure was very slight and did not seem to affect their physical health. But their cognitive abilities, especially in math, seemed affected, and they were one-third more likely to fail middle school.
The uncertainty in this field is enormous, but we have learned that a uterus is not a diving bell that insulates its occupant from the world's perils. Chemicals like thalidomide and DES proved tragic for those exposed to them while in their mothers' wombs. And it's now high time to take a closer look at unregulated chemicals that envelop us -- and may be shaping our progeny for decades to come.

HEADLINE: On the Foreclosure Front

 BODY:
The housing mess got a lot messier last week as JPMorgan Chase halted 56,000 foreclosures amid doubts that it had correctly followed laws on the foreclosure process. The announcement came soon after GMAC Mortgage suspended an undisclosed number of foreclosures to gain time to review its legal procedures. There may be more suspensions to come. 
It is hard to be shocked. During the bubble, banks and other lenders ignored loan standards and stuffed the mortgage pipeline with toxic loans and related securities. Since the bubble burst, efforts to rework bad loans have been slowed by the lenders' resistance, and by their incompetence.
Now we learn that foreclosures, the end of the mortgage pipeline, have also been handled with a disregard for rules and standards. There is a pattern here -- one that lawmakers and policy makers must change.
At issue now are affidavits that a foreclosing lender must file in many states' courts. The person signing the affidavits attests to having knowledge of important facts, like the lender's legal standing to foreclose and the amount owed. But in a rush to process hundreds of thousands of foreclosures, it turns out that the signers at Chase and GMAC processed 10,000 or more documents a month -- ''robo-signing'' in industry parlance -- without personal knowledge of the facts.
The improprieties raise the prospect that some families may have lost their homes in a less-than-legal process, and that some buyers of foreclosed homes may not have clear title to their properties.
To the extent the suspensions ensure a process that is legal and fair, they are to the good. But delays feed uncertainty, and that could be bad for the economy. Will they result in fewer foreclosures, helping to prop up prices? Or will they create a backlog of foreclosed homes that will push prices down when they come to market?
The best outcome would be for lenders to work harder to avoid foreclosures altogether. Congress and the administration need to give borrowers more tools to fight for modifications of their mortgages that will allow more Americans to stay in their homes.
The Obama antiforeclosure effort, for instance, requires lenders to do an analysis to see whether it is more prudent to foreclose on a troubled loan or to modify it. Lawyers for borrowers say that it is often unclear why a modification is denied. Congress should pass a law giving homeowners the right to challenge any foreclosure if the lender cannot show it has done a proper analysis.
The Dodd-Frank financial reform law could also help. One provision authorizes -- but does not require -- more government spending to provide legal services for struggling homeowners. That should be a priority.
What sort of loan modifications are available matters a lot. Reductions in principal are generally regarded as the best way to both deliver relief to homeowners and avoid redefault. The administration has altered its programs somewhat to emphasize principal reductions. It must press lenders to follow through.
The central weakness in the administration's antiforeclosure efforts is that participation by lenders has been voluntary -- with little or no consequences if loans are not adequately reworked. The robo-signing scandal is yet another reminder that it is folly to rely on banks that got us into this mess to get us out.

HEADLINE: Welcome To Smallville

BYLINE: By SAM LUBELL

 BODY:
Lately the American Dream has been looking a lot smaller. Wallets, of course, have shrunk, and so have cars. Now houses, the very symbol of that dream, are shrinking too.
A survey by the American Institute of Architects reveals that 57 percent of architecture firms reported a decrease in the square footage of their residential projects in 2010 compared with 13 percent back in 2005, when size was still a virtue and a McMansion was considered a good investment. And according to the National Association of Homebuilders, the average house size dropped last year to 2,438 square feet, down more than 100 square feet from 2007.
''We went through a sort of baroque period, with an obsession for moreness,'' said Alan Koch, a principal at Taalman Koch Architecture in Los Angeles. ''I think the hysteria of 'more is better' is really cooling off.''
Replacing this moreness is the cult of small. Books like ''Tiny Houses'' (Rizzoli, 2009), the new edition of ''Little House on a Small Planet'' (Lyons Press, 2009) and ''Small Eco Houses: Living Green in Style'' (Universe, 2010) celebrate the beauty of smallness; in magazines, the microhouse has become a standard typology. 
Koch and his partner, Linda Taalman, in particular have made a cottage industry out of smallness. Their firm is currently working on more than 10 of its prefabricated itHouses around California (average living space size: about 1,000 square feet). The houses are built using recycled materials and feature solar panels, but their most earth-friendly aspect is the footprint, which sets limits on construction materials and energy use. (Koch and Taalman's own itHouse, near Joshua Tree, cost about $265,000 to build.) And according to Koch, the intimate scale helps to bring owners closer to nature -- if not to one another -- and forces them to pare down to the essentials.
''It gives you a chance to make a new start,'' said Koch, who also sees a new focus on the quality rather than the size of spaces. Another of his projects, for the artist Uta Barth in the Mar Vista neighborhood of Los Angeles, started out as an addition to Barth's 1,200-square-foot house but was trimmed down to just a renovation. ''We kept paring it back, saying, 'Why do we need that? Does this really need to be there?' We thought, Instead of spending money on square footage, why don't we just spend money on a nicer floor?''
Dirk Denison, a Chicago architect who specializes in large luxury houses, recently worked on the renovation of a 2,200-square-foot-house in Carmel, Calif. The owners, Kathy and Gary Bang, had downsized from four houses -- including a 5,000-square-foot dwelling near Asheville, N.C., with a 1,100-square-foot guesthouse -- to just one, which Denison reimagined with a large central courtyard and spaces that flow into one another. Now every room is used on a regular basis (rarely the case with their previous houses). ''It's very freeing to live with a lot less stuff,'' said Kathy, who still can't seem to believe that she owns only one set of flatware.
In cities where real estate is scarce, ''less is more'' is the only way to go. In the California cities of Manhattan Beach and Hermosa Beach, for example, ultrasmall lots pose a challenge to even the most creative architects. Houses of between 1,600 and 1,800 feet by architects like Dean Nota, Make Architects, LeanArch and XTen Architecture all feature multi-use living spaces on the top floors, large windows and wide balconies to maximize views, direct sunlight and the illusion of space.
Indeed, Duo Dickinson, a Connecticut architect who has written several books on small houses and designs them as well, said the best small houses share the same basic ingredients: interconnecting axes and vistas, high ceilings, a connection between inside and out, and density of storage. A case in point: the 1,300-square-foot renovation and addition by the San Francisco firm Apparatus in that city's Glen Park neighborhood, on a corner lot that is only 13.5 feet wide. In order to make the best use of the space, the architects left the interior roof exposed and created rooms that serve multiple functions: the kitchen and dining room double as hallways, and the master bathroom also serves as a laundry room.
The Portland, Ore., architects Brian White and Michel Weenick of Architecture W recently built a 1,500-square-foot house in Nagoya, Japan, where multi-use rooms are the cultural norm. The kitchen functions as a dining room, and the living room is designed with sliding doors that can close off a guest bedroom with a Murphy bed. There is also a 650-square-foot apartment below for the in-laws.
Stuart Hills, the principal architect at Apparatus, sees his clients going smaller not just to save money but also to save face. ''In the '90s all my clients were driving Land Rovers, and now they all have Priuses,'' he said. ''They don't want to be at the carpool line at their school with what's perceived as a gas guzzler. It's the same with houses.'' But size, of course, is relative. Two thousand square feet seems modest until you compare it to Path Architecture's prototype for an off-the-grid prefab house called the Roho, which at about 200 square feet is smaller than your average garage. A glass wall and double-height ceiling make the living space feel larger than it is.
A new development outside of Austin, Tex., called Agave has enlisted several local architecture firms to create what is billed as ''the largest collection of modern designed homes in the nation.'' (So far 130 houses have been built; plans call for 460 more.) Here, the average house size is about 1,600 square feet; the smallest is around 1,200. Open-plan designs put a premium on public spaces, and bedrooms are often smaller because ''people really tend to just sleep in bedrooms,'' said the project coordinator Chris Czichos, echoing the wisdom of Frank Lloyd Wright, whose Usonian houses allotted minimal space to bedrooms and bathrooms. Rick and Cindy Black, who have 12 houses in Agave, set a precedent back in 2005 with the design of their own 1,100-square-foot home, a series of lofty cubes near the University of Texas. The house, Rick said, ''generated some buzz because it was pretty exceptional in Texas at the time.'' Still, he sees the return to smaller living spaces as nothing new: ''In the '50s, four people lived in a 1,000-square-foot home pretty often. Standards have changed. We've got more stuff now.''
Correction: October 17, 2010, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Oct. 3 about the decrease in the square footage of residential projects misstated the surname of an architect who said that his clients are going smaller for economic and ecological reasons. He is Stuart Hills, not Hill.

HEADLINE: Only the Players Change In the Eagles' Eternal Drama

BYLINE: By MIKE TANIER. 
Mike Tanier is a contributing editor at FootballOutsiders. com. His picks do not reflect the betting line. All times are Eastern.

 BODY:
Redskins at Eagles
Sunday, 4:15 p.m.
Line: Eagles by 6 1/2
Eagles quarterbacks don't have careers, they have passion plays: operatic sagas gushing with outsize emotions and epic melodrama. Thirty years ago, Ron Jaworski left life and limb on the old Veterans Stadium AstroTurf, enduring 363 sacks and the merciless booing of his own fans. Randall Cunningham replaced Jaworski, and the breathtaking-but-immature scrambler provided jaw-dropping highlights before succumbing to injuries and his own hype. Donovan McNabb combined the best attributes of his predecessors: Jaworski's professionalism, Cunningham's athleticism. Eagles fans never forgave him for it.
McNabb returns to Philadelphia this week to face Michael Vick, who is now at the dizzying top of that roller coaster that McNabb knows will soon plunge into a sulfuric chasm of despair. Vick is the sports world's redemption story of the day, riding a two-game hot streak against awful defenses and magically erasing six years that have included arrests, allegations, inaccurate passes and indifferent work habits. Fans will cheer when Vick leaves the tunnel. They'll make a noise similar to the sound of the dinosaurs going extinct when McNabb steps onto the field. Kevin Kolb will clap politely and awkwardly the whole time. Pick: Eagles
Ravens at Steelers 
Sunday, 1 p.m.
Line: Steelers by 1 1/2
Imagine the possibilities if America had Charlie Batch mania. Pennsylvania department stores wouldn't be able to keep Batch items in stock: Batch jerseys, Batch cereal, Batch Halloween costumes for toddlers, Batch autographed clipboards. In the wake of his three-touchdown effort against the Buccaneers, there would even be plans for a Batch 'n' Bieber album, to be produced by Moby.
If only it were true. Most people have kept Batch's workmanlike efforts in perspective, including Batch himself. ''For me, the one thing I didn't want to do was to come out here and be that weak link,'' Batch told the Sports Network. As usual, the Steelers have few weak links, which is why they can go 3-0 with one quarterback the Lions got rid of nine years ago and another (Dennis Dixon, recovering from surgery) who needed a Web site to remind scouts of his existence.
Ravens running back Ray Rice is questionable with a bruised knee. If he's unavailable, the veteran Willis McGahee will start. It's like going from a Maserati to the leaf collection vehicle. Pick: Steelers
Panthers at Saints
Sunday, 1 p.m.
Line: Saints by 13 1/2
It's one thing not to be able to pass, run, kick or tackle. But snap? The Panthers botched two center-quarterback exchanges last week, and Jimmy Clausen fumbled a third time when he couldn't properly hand the ball off. He even tried wearing a glove on his nonthrowing hand, but it didn't help. Salad tongs and oven mitts are forbidden by N.F.L. rules.
The Saints signed the 46-year-old kicker John Carney to ''help'' Garrett Hartley, who missed a 19-yard overtime chip shot in the loss to the Falcons. Carney was 7 of 11 beyond 30 yards and missed two extra points last season. Maybe the Saints should go back to their old strategy of blowing out opponents so the kicker doesn't matter. Pick: Saints
Bears at Giants
Sunday, 8:20 p.m.
Line: Giants by 3 1/2
The Bears have recorded only two sacks on defense while allowing eight sacks on offense. Their running backs average only 2.8 yards per rush, though that is not such a big deal when you only run the ball to give receivers a breather (13 of the team's 68 rushes are actually Jay Cutler scrambles or kneels). In short, the Bears have all of the same problems as the Giants, only worse.
Of course, the Bears are undefeated, thanks to the arcane rules that nullified a Calvin Johnson touchdown in Week 1 and the Packers' penalty-yardage stimulus package on Monday night. The Bears have their merits (great run defense, big-play-oriented passing game), but we're still in the bouncing-ball stage of the season, where a little good fortune can go a long way. Pick: Giants
Jets at Bills
Sunday, 1 p.m.
Line: Jets by 5 1/2
The Jets have joined the Chargers and the Cowboys as one of the league's shrillest teams. Win or lose, they are always blaring in your eardrums like stereo leaf blowers, strutting after every small accomplishment, fretting over every self-inflicted setback.
Granted, the coach is to blame for much of the excess. Rex Ryan said that his pride was hurt by the Dolphins' offense and that his reputation as an anything-goes anti-disciplinarian (heaven knows what you have to do to get benched for an entire half) ''embarrasses me a little bit.'' Ryan conceded that he considered signing Trent Edwards for a week just to learn secrets about the Bills' offense, as if Edwards really knows any secrets about the Bills' offense. Next week, Ryan should just bring a chalkboard and an iron gauntlet to his news conferences and start screeching. It will have the same overall effect. Pick: Jets
Bengals at Browns
Sunday, 1 p.m.
Line: Bengals by 3 1/2
The Bengals' offensive hero this season has been kicker Mike Nugent. He leads the team in scoring with 29 points, has been perfect on field goals, made two field goals of more than 50 yards, provided all of the scoring in the win over the Ravens in Week 2, and has kicked five touchbacks to help his mistake-prone coverage units. In keeping with team policy, Nugent will now perform an interpretive clog dance after every field goal and star in a reality show. Pick: Bengals
Lions at Packers
Sunday, 1 p.m.
Line: Packers by 14 1/2
The Packers can be counted on for one game per year in which they strain the laws of yellow flag aerodynamics. Monday night's hit parade included a roughing-the-passer penalty to both cause and negate an interception, a pass interference call to wave off another interception, and a holding penalty by Mark Tauscher to nullify a touchdown. Tauscher also committed back-to-back false starts at the Packers' 1-yard line, qualifying him for the Luke Petitgout Award for snap count miscalculation, while setting up a Bears punt return touchdown. If the Packers didn't beat themselves once in a while, who would? Pick: Packers
Broncos at Titans
Sunday, 1 p.m.
Line: Titans by 6 1/2
Kyle Orton is having a quietly excellent season. He has thrown for 1,078 yards in three games while spreading the ball among 11 receivers, many of whom were other teams' castoffs. Unfortunately, the Broncos' defense has recorded only two sacks, their running backs average only 2.5 yards per carry, and the team approaches the end zone as if it were surrounded by an electrified fence. The Titans learned to stop worrying and love Vince Young's arm last week, but Young has grown tired of the back-and-forth media attention he earns. ''Every time it is always something about Vince,'' he said in Wednesday's news conference. ''It's Vince, Vince, Vince, Vince, Vince.'' Actually, Young simply misheard: it's ''Vick, Vick, Vick, Vick, Vick.'' Pick: Broncos
Seahawks at Rams
Sunday, 1 p.m.
Line: Seahawks by 1
The Rams last won two straight games in 2008. After beating the Redskins that year, they trounced the Tony Romo-less Cowboys, 34-14, on the strength of three touchdowns by Steven Jackson. Jackson is questionable for Sunday. The Rams followed those two wins with a 17-game losing streak. You can't make this stuff up. Pick: Seahawks
Colts at Jaguars
Sunday, 4:05 p.m.
Line: Colts by 8
Things that have gone right for the Jaguars this year: 1) Josh Scobee has made all of his field goals. 2) Defensive linemen Tyson Alualu and Terrance Knighton have applied a little pressure. 3) The new backup quarterbacks Trent Edwards and Keith Null reached Jacksonville without getting on the wrong flight. 4) Opponents have incurred 179 yards in penalties, which could be important in the unlikely event of a Jaguars-Packers Super Bowl. 5) After they faced Michael Vick and Peyton Manning in back-to-back games, at least people are watching them. Pick: Colts
Texans at Raiders
Sunday, 4:05 p.m.
Line: Texans by 3
Last week's Texans bandwagon jumping may have been premature, but despite a bad performance against the Cowboys, they are a solid team with one major weakness: pass defense. Opposing quarterbacks have completed 72.8 percent of their passes and have thrown for 1,143 yards and 6 touchdowns without an interception. In fairness, none of those quarterbacks was Bruce Gradkowski. Pick: Texans
Cardinals at Chargers
Sunday, 4:15 p.m.
Line: Chargers by 8
At least the Chargers are creative about their slow starts. In past years, defensive lapses, injuries and an ineffective running game were the culprits. This year, holdouts, bad weather and an inability to cover kickoffs are to blame. The holdout situation is solving itself, with left tackle Marcus McNeill returning to the fold, and the Chargers are taking drastic steps to improve coverage units that made Dexter McCluster and Leon Washington look like Gale Sayers impersonators in recent weeks. The team signed the career special-teamer Quinton Teal, and they plan to use defensive starters like Quentin Jammer as kick gunners. As long as they don't ask Philip Rivers to bust the wedge, it's a foolproof plan. Pick: Chargers
49ers at Falcons
Sunday, 1 p.m.
Line: Falcons by 7
Mike Johnson replaces Jimmy Raye as the Niners' offensive coordinator. His tasks: rebuild Alex Smith into a quality quarterback while avoiding the ire of Mike Singletary. When he's finished, he can tackle easier jobs like fixing the global economy, slaying the Nemean Lion and genetically engineering a nutritious vegetable that tastes just like tiramisu. Pick: Falcons
Patriots at Dolphins
Monday, 8:30 p.m.
Line: Patriots by 1
This week, Gloria Estefan escapes from her airtight luxury suite/panic room to catch a touchdown pass from Chad Henne, who is just thrilled to be allowed to throw a forward pass to anyone. At home, Bill Parcells wonders who activated the owners' suite security protocols and why the trap door to the alligator pit didn't spring. Patriots fans gush over the new running back Danny Woodhead, a Doug Flutie surrogate, causing a Randy Moss mood swing so strong it affects weather patterns. Everybody comes out a winner, but more precisely, the Patriots come out winners. Pick: Patriots

HEADLINE: A Code for Chaos

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
IN June, a Belarus-based computer security firm identified a new computer malware program, Stuxnet, which was repeatedly crashing the computers of one of its clients. Then, last month, a German security researcher suggested that the program's real target might be the Iranian nuclear program -- and that clues in the coding suggested that Israel was the creator. Since then, there has been growing alarm about the worm, as its target and sophistication have become more apparent. The code has appeared in many countries, notably China, India, Indonesia and Iran. It appears designed to attack a certain type of Siemens industrial control computer, used widely to manage oil pipelines, electrical power grids and many kinds of nuclear plants. The question is: Just how dangerous has this worm and cyberwarfare become?
How widespread is cyberwarfare? 
A 2007 F.B.I. report asserted that 108 countries had at least some offensive cyberwarfare capabilities. And there has been widespread speculation that a secret cyberwar ''arms race'' is under way as a number of countries build sophisticated software and hardware attack capabilities. Most recent wars and military engagements, like Russia's quarrel with Estonia in 2007 or with Georgia in 2008, have been accompanied by a ''cyberwar'' engagement, in which government and financial Web sites have been targeted.
What was the earliest case of cyberwarfare?
In his book ''At the Abyss,'' Thomas C. Reed, a former secretary of the Air Force, described a software program known as a Trojan horse, in which industrial control software was covertly added by the United States to equipment being shipped to the Soviet Union from Canada. When the equipment was installed in a trans-Siberian gas pipeline in June 1982, it suddenly went haywire, touching off a huge explosion and fire, according to Mr. Reed.
Another episode in January 1990, the collapse of AT&T's long-distance network, also raised suspicions of sabotage.
But security experts have been concerned about potential cyberattacks since the 1970s, during the early days of the Arpanet, an experimental, military-financed research network that was the predecessor to the Internet. There was great concern about a network connection -- a now old-fashioned 9600 baud modem -- that had been installed by scientific researchers linking Moscow and the United States, via a mathematics research center in Vienna. When national security officials discovered the link, financing to the center was canceled.
How is Stuxnet different?
Stuxnet is the first widely analyzed malware program that is intended to jump from Windows-based computers to a specialized system used for controlling industrial equipment, like electric power grids, manufacturing plants, gas pipelines, dams and power plants. Previously, most high-profile cyberattacks have focused on Web sites and corporate or military networks.
At least, that's true when it comes to proven cyberattacks. But there has also been speculation about episodes that could have been caused by sabotage. For example, The Los Angeles Times reported in 2001 that intrusions into the network that controlled the electrical grid were traced to someone in Guangdong Province, China. Later reports of other electric grid attacks have often included allegations that the break-ins were orchestrated by the Chinese, although no proof has been produced.
In the case of Stuxnet, what are arguments for and against Israel's involvement?
Ralph Langner, a German security researcher, was the first to point out that it appeared that the Stuxnet program had been tailored to attack a nuclear facility or a uranium enrichment plant. And several hints in the code suggest Israeli authorship, including a possible allusion to the Book of Esther, which describes Jewish retaliation against a Persian threat, and a number -- 19790509 -- that appears to refer to the date of the execution of an Iranian Jew by a firing squad in Tehran.
But many military and intelligence analysts, including several with direct knowledge of Israeli intelligence operations, have said it is unlikely that either an Israeli or United States operation would leave such blatant clues. That leaves the possibility that someone wanted to plant evidence pointing incorrectly to Israeli involvement. Most computer security specialists say the authorship of the program may never be discovered.
What kind of attack do computer security experts fear most?
There has been widespread fear about attacks that jam or damage large financial networks, the electric power grid, power plants, transportation systems or any of the modern infrastructure underlying industrial economies.
In many cases, the first step in securing these systems has been to insure that they are entirely separated from the Internet. However, even if they are separated from the Internet, in many cases they use internal networks based on the Internet protocol, as well as common computing equipment, like Microsoft and Intel-based computers. That means they remain potentially vulnerable to a ''sneakernet'' attack, in which a malicious program is physically carried into an isolated network either accidentally or by an intruder.
Can this kind of attack be done by a lone hacker?
In the case of Stuxnet, computer security specialists generally agree that it was not the work of one person but rather a team of sophisticated programmers. Many who have examined the malicious code have stated that it would have required an organization with substantial financial resources to develop, test and then release such a program. Certainly nations with cyberwar capabilities are potential suspects, but they are not the only possible creators. China, Israel and the Palestinians are all known to have irregular cyberarmies of motivated hackers with significant skills.

HEADLINE: Time For a Place In the Country?

BYLINE: By HILARY STOUT

 BODY:
PERHAPS more than any place on earth, New York is a city of real estate fantasists. Imaginations soar with visions of an extra bedroom or even an extra closet, a terrace with a view, a kitchen large enough to entertain in, or the magnificent ways one might fix up that town house down the street.
Over the past couple of years, as the real estate market and the economy both sank, the abiding fantasy of some New Yorkers has been that the market will slip low enough to afford them a weekend house in the country.
A little shingled retreat near a lake. Or a chalet with tall windows and views of mountains. An herb garden. Adirondack chairs and a sloping lawn. A place to grill! Perhaps a swimming pool with a stone patio shaded by a grove of trees ... 
Back to reality. Prices have fallen significantly, but given the lingering uncertainty in the economy, is now a smart time to buy a second home?
A look at some of the second-home markets near New York suggests that it might be a very promising moment. From Columbia County to the Jersey Shore, many properties are selling for significantly below their asking prices (which were already a good 20 percent lower than during the market's peak) and sellers are accepting low offers -- in some cases, very low.
Mortgages on second homes have always been more difficult to get than for primary residences, and lenders today are more stringent than ever. But for buyers who qualify, rates are so low that financing a second-home purchase may never be cheaper.
The big question, of course, is this: Will property values fall further, making a purchase now premature, or are prices -- and interest rates -- about to start turning up?
Brokers report that closings and showings are picking up -- two signs of market health. ''People have started to pull the trigger and make offers,'' said Bill Sidoriak, the principal broker at Fleming Realty, which covers Ulster County, N.Y., and towns like Woodstock and Saugerties. Many buyers, he said, have never before owned a second home.
According to the New York State Association of Realtors, the number of resales of single-family homes (which includes primary residences as well as second homes) in Columbia County was up 36.3 percent the first half of this year compared with the first half of 2009, and prices edged up 4.1 percent during that period.
In Ulster County, the total number of sales grew 43.2 percent and prices grew 6.6 percent. In Suffolk County, on Long Island, which includes the Hamptons and the less pricey North Fork, the number of sales jumped 46.5 percent, but prices were down 0.8 percent.
''It seems like all of a sudden, in the last month and a half, people have been coming out of the woodwork and calling,'' said Mary Beaton Stapleton, an associate broker at Halstead Property in the Hudson Valley. But, like some other brokers, she believes that properties continue to be overvalued. ''I think the market still has a little bit of room to drop here,'' she said, ''whereas in New York City, I think it has bottomed out and now is starting to go up.''
A case in point: At Copake Lake in Columbia County, a new four-bedroom two-bath house with 4,421 square feet of space, cathedral ceilings, two stone fireplaces and a deck on three acres went on the market in April at $1.175 million. One month later, the seller dropped the asking price to $988,000. Just two weeks ago, he slashed it to $828,000. Ms. Stapleton said she advised him that the most recent reduction should have been to $795,000.
In Rifton, a hamlet in Ulster County, an 1825 two-bedroom farmhouse with five fireplaces on seven acres is listed at $299,000. The property, which has a detached studio, would easily have sold for $450,000 during the boom, Mr. Sidoriak said.
In Litchfield County, Conn., a former fishing cottage on Silver Lake in the town of Sharon languished on the market for four years.
The asking price in 2007 was $560,000. By this June it had dropped to $375,000. But there was little interest. A buyer from New York came along at the end of the summer and made an offer of $300,000. No dice. She then came up to $312,000. The seller took the deal.
Daniel Chen and Todd Kelly found they could negotiate on matters other than price. Mr. Chen, a graphic designer, and Mr. Kelly, an artist, who rent an apartment in Brooklyn, closed a couple of weeks ago on an 1890s farmhouse in Accord, an Ulster County hamlet less than two and a half hours from the city.
The property, which had been part of a farm, was listed at $389,000 when they saw it. Instead of haggling on price, the couple persuaded the seller to increase the package by five more acres, encompassing a pond and raising the total acreage to 19.27 from about 14. In return Mr. Chen and Mr. Kelly paid a slightly higher price, $399,000. But it was still comfortably below the limit they had set for themselves, $450,000.
The farmhouse has four bedrooms and a bathroom and a half. But what the couple really love are the seven outbuildings, including a chicken coop, two barns and a corn crib that Mr. Kelly plans to convert into a painting studio.
''I've always wanted a place in the country,'' said Mr. Chen, who grew up in an apartment in Queens. He had saved up enough money to consider buying a condo in Brooklyn, but prices there still seemed prohibitive, well over $500,000 for a one-bedroom, so he set his sights on a weekend place instead. ''The market obviously had a lot to do with it,'' he said.
Brokers in markets considered less fashionable than, say, the Hamptons or Litchfield County report that they have noticed an increase in interest among people who a few years ago might have aspired to a more glamorous locale.
''I think during the boom years people were thinking big -- more land, a place near the shore,'' said Robert Morini, the brokerage manager of the Houlihan Lawrence offices in Brewster and Millbrook, N.Y. ''Now people are scaling down, saying I just want someplace to run to.''
As a result, he said, his firm has experienced a notable pickup in business among weekend buyers in places like Putnam County, N.Y., which includes the town of Cold Spring and the village of Kent and is about an hour and a half north of Manhattan.
''We are back to doing weekend business, which is great,'' Mr. Morini said. ''We are not talking million-dollar-plus homes here. We're talking $300,000 to $600,000, or $700,000.''
One property, he noted, a three-bedroom house on three acres of pastureland in Southern Dutchess County, was listed at $749,000 two years ago and has been ''chasing the market down.'' The price today: $419,000.
''It's an incredible deal for someone,'' said Mr. Morini, who has clients considering making an offer.
On the North Fork of Long Island, sales have been picking up, though prices are still down, said Kathleen Rosenbaum, the principal broker at Lloyd's Realty in Greenpoint. ''I think waterfronts are great values now,'' she said. ''At one time you couldn't touch one for under $1 million. Now there are some for under a mil.''
She cited a new listing in Greenport: a three-bedroom two-bath house with 1,300 square feet of space and a one-car garage on a half-acre lot with about 100 feet of ''deep water,'' meaning you could dock a boat as large as 50 feet. The sellers are asking $849,000. The house, the dock and the bulkhead need extensive renovations, Ms. Rosenbaum said, but the price would have been unheard of a few years ago.
On the Jersey Shore, Paul Vail, who recently opened his own real estate firm after 10 years of working for others, says opportunities for buyers abound.
''Too much inventory has been sitting around for way too long,'' he said. ''It's pretty glutted. But for buyers it's the perfect storm.''
For instance, he said, there are bargains to be had in Asbury Park, an oceanfront community that is marketing itself as more affordable than the Hamptons or Fire Island. Recently he closed a deal there on a 100-year-old home for $569,000. It sold at the asking price after only 41 days on the market, he said, because it was fully renovated. ''That's what moves these days. There is so much on the market, the second-home buyer absolutely wants something they're not going to have to put money into.''
North Beach Asbury Park, a luxury condo complex on the ocean, was conceived and built during the boom years. But by the time it opened, the market was starting to fade, so the developers decided to turn the unsold apartments into rental units. Now, Mr. Vail said, they are putting some back on the market; two-bedroom units with ocean views in a complex that includes a pool and other amenities are listed at $429,000 to $499,000.
Of course, country real estate has microclimates, and just as Asbury Park is not Amagansett, one part of Connecticut may vary from another. Carolyn Klemm, the founder of Klemm Real Estate in Litchfield County, specializes in properties of $500,000 to $10 million. She thinks bargains may already be history. ''There are people out there who don't realize they've missed the bottom of the market,'' said Ms. Klemm, adding that she closed deals on ''$15 million worth of houses'' one week last month.
She recounted a showing recently of a beautiful ''quintessential Connecticut home'' on 12 acres with a long driveway, a swimming pool and views. It was on the market for $2.75 million. Her clients declared that the sellers would never get more than $2.3 million. Almost immediately after they left, somebody bid just under $2.5 million.
The other day, Ms. Klemm said, the owner accepted an offer; she would not disclose what it was.
But Robin Leech, the owner of Robinson Leech Real Estate in Lakeville in northern Litchfield County, says properties are not selling all that fast. In his opinion Litchfield County asking prices are still high -- in some cases as much as 30 percent above market value.
Sellers, feeling the worst is over, are asking more than they can reasonably expect to get, he said. And buyers go in assuming they can chop 10 or 20 percent off the asking price.
''Little by little,'' he said, ''the cream of each category -- lakefront, village houses, country farms -- is being picked off slowly, but there is not a steady surge of activity.''
Most brokers agree it's all about pricing. ''Things can take two weeks to sell if they're priced right, or can take a very long time,'' said Nancy Horowitz-Felcetto, a broker and manager of Halstead's Hudson Valley office.
In Germantown, she said, a four-bedroom Arts and Crafts-style house on 22 acres with old stone walls, a stream and a big weeping willow did nothing for seven months at $695,000. About two months ago the asking price dropped to $595,000. Immediately, Ms. Horowitz-Felcetto had four showings and a reshowing.
Several parties have expressed interest, but there are no offers yet.
Correction: October 10, 2010, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The cover article last Sunday, about the market for second homes around the region, misidentified the town on the North Fork of Long Island where a three-bedroom house with a dock and bulkhead is for sale. It is Greenport, not Greenpoint.

HEADLINE: The Wealth of an Intellect

BYLINE: By NANCY F. KOEHN

 BODY:
MEASURED by fame and lasting influence, there is no other book on economics that comes close to ''The Wealth of Nations'' by Adam Smith. Many aspects of this book, first published in 1776, have become cornerstones of neoclassical economics: the organizing power of self-interest, the ''invisible hand'' of free markets and the crucial role of the division of labor are just three examples.
Smith's ideas have exercised enormous impact on policy-making -- not to mention politics and punditry -- particularly in Britain and the United States, where laissez-faire capitalism set down deep, tangled roots. Small wonder that Smith is known as the founder of modern economics. 
Against this backdrop, it comes as something of a surprise to discover ''Adam Smith: An Enlightened Life'' by Nicholas Phillipson (Yale, $32.50). Mr. Phillipson, an honorary fellow in history at the University of Edinburgh, has written an unabashedly intellectual biography in which Smith's economics thinking is only part -- at times, a smallish part -- of a larger, inherently philosophical story.
According to Mr. Phillipson, Smith was, first and foremost, concerned with developing ''a genuine Science of Man'' -- an effort that began when Smith was a student at Glasgow University. There he studied the classics, jurisprudence, logic and metaphysics; he also met the philosopher Frances Hutcheson and the mathematician Robert Simson. These experiences helped Smith cultivate a respect for placing philosophy on a scientific basis and a compelling interest in thinking systematically.
He spent most of his adult life honing these interests. He worked, Mr. Phillipson recounts, mostly in scholarly settings: as a student and faculty member and as a tutor to the Duke of Buccleuch, the young Scottish noble with whom he traveled as part of his young charge's Grand Tour. He also served as a commissioner of customs in Edinburgh. All of these experiences, Mr. Phillipson makes clear in graceful prose, were grist for Smith's intellectual mill.
The two fruits of this effort were ''The Theory of Moral Sentiments,'' published in 1759, and ''The Wealth of Nations.'' In the earlier book, Smith set out to understand the motivations of human behavior and the development of moral principles within individuals. At the heart of Smith's analysis lies the concept of sympathy (what we know today as empathy), which he saw as the bedrock of all forms of human communication, including commercial exchange. It is sympathy, he writes, that ultimately accounts for ''that great purpose of human life which we call bettering our condition.''
Smith built on this philosophical groundwork in ''The Wealth of Nations.'' Here, in a book of half a million words, he married man's ineluctable drive for improvement with the concept of self-interest to set forth the primary driver of all economic activity: ''It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest.''
More than 230 years later, Smith's concept of the self-interest-seeking individual acting in a competitive environment remains at center stage in mainstream economics.
There are other important contributions in ''The Wealth of Nations,'' including equilibrium theory, opportunity cost, national income and the circular flow of economic activity. Mr. Phillipson, however, devotes little attention to these ideas, concentrating instead on Smith's attack on 18th-century British commercial policy -- government actions intended to manage imperial commerce for the mother country's prosperity -- and his consequent embrace of free trade. Smith regarded restraints on imports and other trade restrictions as a function of ''the wretched spirit of monopoly'' that had afflicted economic activity throughout history.
The policy implications were clear. Free-flowing trade was the road to national prosperity and international concord. The best evidence for Smith's argument, Mr. Phillipson demonstrates, was the rapid progress of the American colonies, where cheap land and the absence of high taxes and other restraints had helped create a thriving society and a robust domestic market. (It is one of the rich ironies of history that Smith's commercial paradigm tore itself away from Britain, its biggest trading partner, in the same year his magnum opus was published.)
The final chapters of Mr. Phillipson's account reconstruct Smith's later years and his efforts to revise both his books. Although Smith had hoped to publish another book, extending his ''Science of Man'' to the liberal sciences and elegant arts, the project outran him. He died on July 1, 1790, after a long illness, lamenting that he had not accomplished more.
''An Enlightened Life'' follows the evolution of Smith's thinking closely and all it owed to the other intellectuals in his orbit, especially David Hume. But Mr. Phillipson's biography tells us almost nothing about Smith the human being. Discussion of Smith's likes and dislikes, his loves (he adored his mother and lived with her for much of his life) and even his appearance is largely absent from this book.
Mr. Phillipson's initial qualifier -- that Smith left a scanty historical record -- does not quite explain the book's overriding focus on its subject as a factory of philosophical ideas. One longs for a sense of Smith's harsh, stammering voice that worked so well in the lecture halls. Or a whiff of his legendary absent-mindedness. (He once put bread and butter into boiling water and complained about how bad the tea was.)
Still, ''An Enlightened Life'' delivers on its original promise: to trace the intellectual development of Smith's mind through the making of his own, essentially philosophical, texts. For all that subsequent generations, no less our own, have taken from Smith's economic contributions, it is indeed enlightening to understand the broader sweep of his vision.

HEADLINE: Stage Is Set (Again) For a Blue-Chip Revival

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a senior editor at Money magazine. E-mail: fund@nytimes.com

 BODY:
EVER since big blue-chip domestic stocks fell out of favor in early 2000, many market strategists have regularly been predicting their imminent return to glory.
In 2003, after the tech bubble burst and market valuations started to fall back to earth, large-capitalization stocks were supposed to catch a second wind. They didn't.
Amid the global financial panic of 2008, investors were supposed to regain their appetite for blue chips because, in uncertain times, these industry-dominating companies could offer steadier growth. Yet, that year, large-cap stocks fell even harder than small-company stocks. And to add insult to injury, small stocks went on to outpace large ones in 2009 and so far this year. 
Today, some market watchers are armed with a kitchen sink full of arguments that the stage is set for a blue-chip revival.
Not only are the large caps cheaper than small caps by historical standards, but some of these big companies, like Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft, are trading at price-to-earnings ratios of nine or less, based on projected earnings. Large stocks also have greater exposure to foreign markets, including emerging markets like China.
''I actually think large-cap stocks have more growth potential because they can go outside the United States,'' said Thomas H. Forester, manager of the Forester Value fund, who has been bullish about this group since 2008.
Large stocks are also sitting on a mountain of cash. ''At some point, these companies will start using that money to raise dividends, buy back their stock, or start buying each other,'' said Robert E. Turner, chief investment officer at Turner Investment Partners, a money management firm in Berwyn, Pa. He says that cash has been especially important since the disruptions of the financial crisis.
All of these trends could benefit large-cap stocks, which have had a miserable decade. While small caps were up nearly 4 percent, annualized, from 2000 to the end of 2009, and mid-caps rose more than 6 percent, annualized, the large-cap Standard & Poor's 500 lost about 1 percent.
But before investors get too worked up about a pending blue-chip boom, it's important to note that it could take months, if not years, before large stocks stage a real comeback.
FOR starters, the bull market that began in March 2009 is only 18 months old. Historically, shares of small-but-nimble companies have outpaced the blue chips through the first two years of a rally, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at S.& P. In fact, in the second years of bull markets since 1950, the S.& P. 600 index of small stocks has gained 22 percent, on average, versus 18 percent for the S.& P. 500 index of blue-chip shares.
So ''there's absolutely no reason why small caps can't keep outperforming large caps,'' Mr. Stovall said.
James B. Stack, editor of the InvesTech Market Analyst, a newsletter based in Whitefish, Mont., noted that the so-called Nifty Fifty era -- when the market's biggest growth stocks dominated -- came to an end in the 1973-74 bear market. After that, small stocks trounced blue chips until the early 1980s.
That's not the only example of a slow recovery. After the 1929 crash, it wasn't until 1945 that large stocks made it back to even. And blue-chip stock prices appreciated at a relatively modest rate in succeeding years: 4.6 percent, annualized, from 1945 to 1953.
Finally, there's this: Large stocks continue to be the darlings of professional investors. A recent survey of money managers by Russell Investments found that two-thirds described themselves as bullish on large growth stocks, versus only around half who are similarly optimistic about small-cap shares.
That may not be a good sign. ''If the consensus says small caps will underperform large caps, you know there's a good chance they won't,'' Mr. Stovall said.
At the very least, says Robert Sharps, who manages assets for T. Rowe Price institutional clients, even if blue chips don't return to their late-1990s glory anytime soon, it's still ''highly probable that returns in the next decade will be markedly better than the last one.''

HEADLINE: Watching Its Weight But Hugging the Curves

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE ULRICH

 BODY:
JENNY CRAIG, Richard Simmons, Oprah in her doughnut-denying prime -- none can match Lotus Cars in a Biggest Loser contest.
The English automaker made its reputation with slenderized sporting cars, from Formula One racers to street machines. Unprompted, car aficionados can recite the engineering ethos of the company's founder, Colin Chapman: ''Simplify, then add lightness.''
Lotus's mantra is one of the industry's burdens. Automakers would love to slash 1,000 pounds from every model to meet fuel mileage rules. But any crash diet is stymied by crash standards that stuff cars with safety features, protecting people but adding pounds.
Then, demanding consumers fatten up the cars further by asking for weighty indulgences like seats that heat, cool, massage and play DVDs on rear-facing screens. 
As for performance cars, all else being equal, a lighter car handles better than a heavy one. That's why the Lotus Elise convertible and Exige hardtop -- which, at less than 2,000 pounds apiece, are among the most feathery automobiles on the road -- are more fun than a 5,200-pound Bentley Continental GT, even if the Bentley can embarrass them in a stoplight drag race.
But the basic $50,000 Elise -- so good that Lotus let Tesla replace the gas engine with lithium batteries and proclaim that the $110,000 Roadster had revolutionized the automobile -- is suddenly 15 years old.
With its undiluted character, the Elise can be simultaneously loved and hated for its go-kart vibe, naked interior and zero tolerance for dessert-loving Americans.
Realizing that many drivers -- don't forget passengers -- have no patience for such uncompromising sports cars, Lotus offered the Evora for the 2010 model year. As for being distinctive, can you name another midengine car with four seats?
Compared with its siblings, the Evora is 22 inches longer, 5 wider and 4 taller; it is only 4.7 inches shorter than a Porsche 911.
The added size lifts the Evora's weight to 3,047 pounds. Yet that's 250 pounds less than a comparable 911 or Corvette, and 800 less than the burly Nissan GT-R.
How's that possible? For starters, the Evora's three-piece aluminum chassis weighs just 440 pounds, no more than a pair of well-fed occupants. If you grabbed the Lotus at both ends and wrung it out, it would take nearly 20,000 pound-feet of force to make the chassis twist by one degree. Lotus insists that the car's structure is 50 percent stiffer than the Ferrari F430's.
The result is a high-character British charmer that starts just under $75,000 (about $85,000 well-equipped), but looks and handles like a six-figure supercar.
The Evora certainly has style and exclusivity. There's a nearly Ferrariesque flair to its undulating profile, narrow cockpit and ridiculously saucy hips.
Lotus plans to build just 2,000 Evoras a year, with about 700 bound for the United States. Pull into any valet line -- as I did for an event at a New York area hotel -- and the attendants are likely to park the Evora front and center amid the Bentleys and Lamborghinis.
Given the wide door sills, entering or exiting still involves stretching, but it's nothing like the contortionist act required with the Elise.
Inside the Evora, Lotus has made a real effort to create a luxurious ambience, with a leather-wrapped dash and door panels, tremendous Recaro seats and even a tilting-and-telescoping magnesium steering wheel.
The effort isn't fully convincing: round metal control buttons, including one for the glovebox, are cryptically labeled, and their backlit labels wash out in sunlight. The Alpine audio system sounds fine, but it's shoehorned into the dash like a discount special and its tiny buttons and touch screen are awkward. Parked behind that navigation screen, however, is a nifty touch: a hand-held GPS unit that pops out for portable use.
During my test, a hunk of sound-muffling carpet came unglued and wound itself around the clutch pedal. I had to pull the carpet off the firewall to go safely on my way. Later, when a passenger pulled his interior door handle, its trim popped loose.
Ah, the Evora truly is a British sports car!
The driver's footwell is also too narrow to allow a dead pedal that you could brace your left foot against. But all told, the Evora is well-packaged, given its size and midengine layout.
As with the Porsche 911, the back seat is for toddler emergencies; more usefully, it provides space for a pair of suitcases or other cargo. The rear trunk adds another six cubic feet of storage, making the Evora a genuine traveling companion.
But don't think that Lotus has gone all soft. The Evora is still a purist's delight, as I learned at the Monticello Motor Club, a road course northwest of New York City.
Like the Elise, the Evora borrows a Toyota engine, this one a 3.5-liter, 276-horsepower V-6 that has been spared a life sentence in a Camry or Sienna. Lotus adds its own clutch, flywheel and exhaust system, and it tweaks the engine controls for more linear response.
The Lotus isn't slow, with a 4.8-second dash from a standstill to 60 miles per hour and a top speed of 162 m.p.h. But the engine, while smooth, remains unremarkable for a car in this class, whether in horsepower, torque (at a peak of 258 pound-feet) or stirring sound. When a Nissan 370Z at half the price can mount 56 more horses from its V-6, that's an issue.
The modest power and slim physique contribute to an economy rating of 18 miles per gallon in town and 27 on the highway. Cruising at 65 m.p.h. I got a Miatalike 30 m.p.g.
The Lotus's other sore thumb is a rubbery, long-throw shifter for the 6-speed manual gearbox. Considering Lotus's engineering wizardry, I'd expect at least the precision of a Honda manual. An optional 6-speed paddle-shifted automatic will be available next spring.
Yet as with the Elise and its 4-cylinder Toyota engine, it's to Lotus's credit that the Evora remains one of the most soul-stirring sports cars.
Lotus claims the Evora can top 1.2 g's of cornering force. That beats every car in the price class, from the Corvette Z06 and Porsche 911 to the Nissan GT-R. And without moving to the Amalfi coast, I couldn't find a public curve where I could sanely challenge the Evora's capabilities.
Though the Evora provides power steering -- unlike the Elise -- the feel is uncanny, with none of the woolen layers of electronic interference that mar some performance cars. There is a stability control system with a competition mode to sharpen the throttle response and raise the tachometer's red line past 7,000 r.p.m.
At Monticello, I was joined by a pair of dedicated Lotus owners: Ari Straus, the track's chief operating officer; and David Nagler, the former president of Lotus Ltd., which calls itself the nation's largest Lotus club.
Flanked by their teensy, old-school Lotuses, the men weren't entirely welcoming to this plush new sibling. ''It's too big, too heavy,'' Mr. Straus said, ticking off his preconceptions. ''It's not supposed to have a back seat.''
Pouring rain at Monticello seemed another wet blanket. And then the Evora shook it off, hitting the track with dazzling balance and control. With a wheelbase 11 inches longer than the Elise's, the Evora proved less twitchy near its limits, and its fatter tires and supple suspension helped it lay down more power coming out of turns.
After riding shotgun, Mr. Straus -- a Grand Am racer on his home turf -- took the wheel, ripping off laps with a casual grace that belied the pelting rain. Both he and Mr. Nagler left the track paying their ultimate compliment: the Evora is a true Lotus, they agreed.
Yet one point sparked universal agreement: Some buyers will want more urgency. Last week at the Paris auto show, Lotus introduced the supercharged Evora S that goes on sale in the spring. That 350-horsepower version will have a better power-to-weight ratio than the Porsche 911S, a level that sounds just about perfect.
(Lotus created a buzz in Paris by introducing five concept models, including a radically redesigned Elise and a reborn Esprit supercar -- with a midmounted, 620-horsepower V-8 -- expected to go on sale in 2013 for about $175,000. )
My test drive of the Evora began, like Mr. Straus's and Mr. Nagler's, with modest expectations. But by the time a car-loving, cigar-chewing truck driver named Joe came to retrieve the car, I was surprisingly sad to see it go. As I drove the Lotus onto the flatbed, two children stopped cold on my Brooklyn sidewalk to stare at this life-size Matchbox toy.
''Daddy?'' one asked his father, his concern matching my own, ''where are they taking that pretty car?''
I wanted to tell him: To sports-car heaven, son. A place where Lotuses run free and never shed their carpets.
INSIDE TRACK: Light makes right.

HEADLINE: Sniffing .300, Hitters Hunker Down on Last Chances

BYLINE: By ALAN SCHWARZ. 
E-mail: keepingscore@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Before his last plate appearance of the 2007 season, with the postseason looming and his catcher's body disintegrating like a '72 Impala, Victor Martinez came to the plate and noticed the scoreboard taunting him.
.299.
He had gone 2 for 3 that day and figured he had clawed his batting average up to .300. But Martinez was still at .299465, which is about the closest one can dance with .300 without sharing its dress.
''The only way I was going to walk,'' Martinez recalled with a laugh recently, ''was a pitch in the dirt or over my head.'' 
Normally a selective hitter, Martinez rapped a 2-1 fastball through the infield and finished the season at .301. In doing so, he contributed not only to the back of his baseball card, but also to a study of behavior that goes well beyond baseball.
Two economists at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, while investigating how round numbers influence goals, examined the behavior of major league hitters from 1975 to 2008 who entered what became their final plate appearance of the season with a batting average of .299 or .300 (in at least 200 at-bats).
They found that the 127 hitters at .299 or .300 batted a whopping .463 in that final at-bat, demonstrating a motivation to succeed well beyond normal (and in what was usually an otherwise meaningless game).
Most deliciously, not one of the 61 hitters who entered at .299 drew a walk -- which would have fired those ugly 9s into permanence because batting average considers bases on balls neither hit nor at-bat.
Martinez said that ''.299 doesn't look as good as that 3 in front.''
Now, hitting .300 carries less prestige than it once did. Offensive metrics more founded in science have turned batting averages of .300 (prince), .350 (king) and .200 (court jester) into ranks within an increasingly irrelevant royal family.
Yet even today's hitters will clearly try much harder when a .300 average is at stake, said Devin Pope, who co-wrote the study with Wharton's Uri Simonsohn. (The paper has been accepted for publication by the journal Psychological Science.) What they found could intrigue behavioral economists from academia to Las Vegas, as well as add a little spice to this weekend's final regular-season games.
Pope and Simonsohn found that the percentage of hitters who end a season at various averages from .280 to .320 -- those hitting .294, .295, .302 and so on -- decreases, as expected, in a relatively smooth fashion. The percentage plummets at .299 and skyrockets at .300, before settling into its normal, steady decline.
''Usually when you look at sports, the opponent is motivated, too -- like in the World Series, pitchers are trying just as hard,'' said Pope, who recently took a position at the University of Chicago. ''What you have here is asymmetric motivation, and it results in a wild divergence from what would otherwise be expected.''
As part of their round-number study, Pope and Simonsohn also examined the behavior of high school students taking the SAT. They found that those who received scores ending with 90 were significantly more likely to retake the test than if their score ended in 00, clearly striving for the ladder's next rung. (Imagine if the students could take their scores to salary arbitration.)
The round-number phenomenon demonstrated itself on several major league fields this weekend. Neil Walker, at .300 entering Saturday, fell to .298. But Placido Polanco (.299), Starlin Castro (.300), Adrian Gonzalez (.298) and Vladimir Guerrero (.301) improved their averages on Saturday. Guerrero is a notoriously free swinger, so watch for him to go after pitches somewhere in the first-base mezzanine.
''We don't think of numbers in a continuous fashion -- we react to round numbers differently,'' Pope said. ''There's a ton of literature on pricing, where $2.99 seems much cheaper than something priced at $3. We think this is a similar psychology -- for the same reason stores price at $2.99, hitters want to hit that target of .300.''
At Yankee Stadium a week ago, in the Boston Red Sox clubhouse a few lockers down from Martinez, David Ortiz laughed at baseball players' aversion to 9s. (Strange, given the sport's skeletal use of 3s and 9s.) Five years ago, in a meaningless 162nd game against the Yankees, Ortiz entered batting .299 for the season; he struck out in the first inning to drop to .298 and walked in the third, knowing he still had a few more chances to swing for .300.
One inning later, Ortiz singled to reach .300. He batted one more time in the sixth -- he walked, refusing to swing at anything that might result in an out -- and was, because of the statistical awareness of Manager Terry Francona, replaced on the bases to make sure that .300 season average would last forever.
''In baseball, that one point, that one number, makes a huge difference,'' Ortiz said. ''We were talking the other day, the guys were saying that this was the first year since 2007 that I get 100 R.B.I.
''They forget that I got 99 last year. I'm like, what happened to those 99? They don't count?''

THE SHADOW MARKET
How a Group of Wealthy Nations and Powerful Investors Secretly Dominate the World
By Eric J. Weiner
304 pp. Scribner. $26
In the early 1990s, when Sony was still digesting Columbia Pictures and Japan was seen as an economic threat to the United States, I was urged by my father to learn to bow and wear a kimono, because we were all going to be working for Japanese companies one day. The cultural artifact of the moment was Michael Crichton's borderline racist novel ''Rising Sun,'' which became a film starring Sean Connery and warned of Japanese corporate imperialism and the menace it posed to our way of life.
The business writer Eric J. Weiner offers a different sort of road map for a strangely parallel time in his dense and disturbing new book, ''The Shadow Market: How a Group of Wealthy Nations and Powerful Investors Secretly Dominate the World.'' 
The word ''secretly'' in the subtitle is misleading: most of the examples Weiner gives aren't secret at all; consumers of the news will be aware that America is in debt to China, which owns around $846 billion in United States Treasury securities, and that hedge funds and private equity firms have become important actors on the global economic stage. While the United States limps along with high unemployment and a toxic housing market, countries like China and oil-rich states in the Middle East find themselves in newly powerful positions, with boatloads of money to spend. Increasingly, they are choosing to spend it in America, where they see opportunity for lucrative returns and increased political leverage through their investments.
The ''shadow market'' Weiner refers to -- not to be confused with the ''shadow banking system,'' which was largely blamed for the collapse of our economy -- is ''the invisible and ever-shifting global nexus where money mixes with geopolitical power,'' a vague and ominous allusion to sovereign wealth funds, hedge funds and private equity funds. Weiner argues that these huge pools of unregulated capital have come to dominate the world financial system, largely without our noticing it, and that as a result the United States has lost much of its economic influence. While he discusses the investment arms of the governments of Qatar, Singapore, Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia, the book could have been subtitled ''How China Cooked America in Soy Sauce and Ate It for Dinner,'' since China is Weiner's most intimidating example. According to his worldview, our friendly adversary in the Far East has the United States in a headlock, and we should all be stockpiling potato seeds and scrambling to learn Mandarin.
Did you know, for example, that China has invested billions in the Blackstone Group and other private equity firms and hedge funds? That it has invested billions more to gain access to natural resources in Iran and Australia and all over Africa? And that when President Obama and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner visited China, each was basically scolded like a schoolboy and sent on his way? We are in hock to the Chinese, and ''as a result of these transformations,'' Weiner writes, ''China is increasingly able to set the terms for the dialogue between the two countries.''
It would be easy to quibble with some of the points Weiner makes, like his suggestion that the current shadow market is different from previous, Western-dominated ones because ''even when you look at America's imperial incursions, they were typically based on advancing the cause of commerce and trade,'' as opposed to advancing political goals. (Victims of the American-financed civil war in Guatemala, to name just one such incursion, might argue that they are one and the same.) But Weiner succeeds in making the case that something fundamental has changed in the world with the rise of Eastern and Middle Eastern economies, and that is worth paying attention to.
The trouble is the delivery. A sober book like ''The Shadow Market'' is never going to read like a Crichton potboiler, but it veers too far in the other direction, often sounding like a report for the Council on Foreign Relations. There is too much survey and not enough analysis. Weiner gears his advice mainly toward investors, whom he urges to buy commodities and ''make a point of traveling to China or India or Brazil to see the changes for themselves.'' The lesson is that America has been self-absorbed and complacent, having grown fat and happy during years of bloated credit and illusory wealth. Yeah, we're Rome, we get it. Now what?

HEADLINE: For Nevada Casinos, Threats in California

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

 BODY:
LINCOLN, Calif. -- The Thunder Valley casino, outside Sacramento, has all the trappings of a modern gambling resort: endless rows of slot machines, a high-end spa offering gold-leaf facials and the type of performers -- Tony Bennett, Peter Cetera -- for whom casinos were seemingly invented.
But ask Ken Lawson why he brought his father, George, here on a recent afternoon, and his answer has nothing to do with shows, slots or service. 
''It's just a shorter drive,'' said Mr. Lawson, who lives in Rio Linda, a nearby suburb.
Like many, Mr. Lawson favors California convenience over old-school Nevada glitz. A decade after California voters expanded gambling on tribal lands, Indian casinos here have slowly been squeezing their competition across the border by building increasingly elaborate -- and exceedingly accessible -- gambling centers along the major freeways leading from the Bay Area and the Central Valley over the Sierra Nevada.
The result has been a prolonged slump for many of Northern Nevada's gambling towns. In Reno, ''the biggest little city in the world,'' gambling revenue has declined in 30 of the last 37 months, according to Michael Lawton, a research analyst with the Nevada Gaming Control Board. And while the recession has certainly taken its toll on gambling nationwide, experts say the problems have more to do with proximity than pocketbooks.
''Less people are coming over the hill,'' said Frank Streshley, chief of the tax and license division of the Gaming Control Board.
In Reno, total gambling revenue is off 25 percent since the spring of 2007, according to David G. Schwartz, the director of the Center for Gaming Research at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, while other nearby towns on Lake Tahoe have seen declines of more than 40 percent.
Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr., president and chief executive of the American Gaming Association, the casino industry lobbying group, said the effect on Reno and nearby cities is particularly profound when snow shuts off the mountain passes.
''I've been under a car many times putting chains on,'' said Mr. Fahrenkopf, who grew up in Reno. ''I can't think of another market anywhere in the United States that's been hit as hard as Northern Nevada by the spread of Native American gaming.''
Congress set up the statutory basis for the regulation of Indian gambling in 1988, and in 2000, California voters passed a ballot initiative that allowed slots and house-backed card games like blackjack on Indian land. (Before that, only so-called Class II games -- primarily bingo and poker -- were permitted.)
Since then, the state has become the single-largest Indian gambling market in the country, with estimated revenues of $7.3 billion in 2008, according to Alan P. Meister, an analyst with Nathan Associates, an economic consulting firm. And at least some of that growth has to do with convenience.
And while early tribal operations may have been little more than small, bland card rooms, recent renovations are enhancing properties throughout Northern California. Over the last two years, several tribes have added hotels and event centers and have expanded floor space.
More than such amenities, though, what California casinos seem to be banking on is location. Thunder Valley is owned by the United Auburn Indian Community, which is made up of Miwok and Maidu Indians. It expanded to 200,000 square feet of gambling space over the summer, adding a steakhouse, a 300-room hotel and a cabana-ringed pool. The casino sits in the middle of a patch of browning farmland, flanked by a few lonely ranch houses and a nearby landfill, but is also just minutes off Interstate 80, a well-traveled corridor between the Bay Area and Reno.
To the south of Thunder Valley is the hulking Red Hawk casino, opened by the Shingle Springs Band of Miwok Indians just outside Sacramento in December 2008. The opening caused traffic jams along Highway 50, a main east-west route to South Lake Tahoe from which the casino has its own exit.
Meanwhile in Reno, several casinos are out of business or have been closed for extended periods in the city's downtown, where low-rent motels sit near a new minor-league ballpark and the National Bowling Center.
With fewer Californians at the tables, many Reno casinos are now focusing on local players, using loyalty cards, inexpensive entertainment and direct mail and e-mail offers. And while the Reno downtown district still has clusters of casinos -- something the California tribes, almost all single-casino operations, do not offer -- the most successful casinos in Reno offer more basic suburban amenities.
''Good parking, well-lit floors, good security and easy access have become more attractive for local clientele,'' said William Eadington, director of the Institute for the Study of Gambling and Commercial Gaming at University of Nevada at Reno.
Reno tourism officials, meanwhile, began a marketing campaign last year called ''Reno Tahoe, USA -- Far From Expected,'' which emphasized activities like world-record motorcycle jumps, an exhibit featuring Elvis Presley's Cadillac and the world's largest sporting goods store. And a radio ad in the Bay Area, featuring a talking bighorn sheep, boasts of the region's ''trails, beaches, fairways, rivers,'' but makes no mention of casinos.

HEADLINE: Make Him an Offer That He'll Accept

BYLINE: By SARAH KERSHAW. 
E-mail: bigdeal@nytimes.com

 BODY:
HE was a pioneer nonpareil in that virtual wasteland once known as the Lower West Side, long before real estate brokers had the opportunity to market it as the ''Gold Coast of TriBeCa.'' 
Now, after 50 years in the neighborhood, Mardig Kachian, a sculptor, is leaving for Brooklyn.
It was in 1960 that Mr. Kachian, now 73, moved into 179 West Street, where he rented three floors for a total of $75 a month. He became a tenacious holdout in the neighborhood, as all around him buildings were being condemned and demolished for an urban renewal project. He fought the city for years to stave off the demolition of the raggedy four-story West Street property, built in 1845. It stood until 2003.
Along the way, he bought a warehouse at 7-9 Harrison Street, and created 24 lofts. He moved into his Harrison Street building, between Hudson and Greenwich Streets, in 2000, saying that after so many years on West Street, ''I wanted to leave the building. It was free-standing, and when it was windy, it was shaking and I had my heart in mouth.''
A few weeks ago, Mr. Kachian put the Harrison Street building on the market -- with no listing price.
The listing broker, Nick Petkoff, of Massey and Knakal Realty Services, is marketing the building, which has about 33,500 square feet of space, 24 units on six floors, a retail floor and a cellar. The listing says the building could be redeveloped; or converted into a town house; or converted into an apartment building with six full-floor units, or 12 smaller units, and retail space.
Mr. Kachian has bought a studio in Gowanus, Brooklyn. He said he decided to leave the neighborhood so that he could devote his time to his artwork.
He said that he would let the market decide what the TriBeCa building was worth.
''I refuse to put a price on it,'' he said. ''Let's see what happens. I don't want to put any karma on it or wistful hopes on it.''

HEADLINE: Mingle, Meet, and Maybe Move In

BYLINE: By JED LIPINSKI

 BODY:
WHAT if your apartment roommate moved out abruptly with no forwarding address, leaving you to pay his half of that month's rent? Frantic mass e-mails and Facebook posts have yielded no replacements, and you are tired of dealing with spammers and strangers on Craigslist.
With next month's rent looming, what do you do? 
One option is Roommates Wanted NYC, a new service that lets potential roommates meet in a group setting, usually a bar or club, avoiding time-consuming phone calls and open houses. Founded by Dene Farrell, a developmental biologist, and Jeff Orlick, a graphic artist and food blogger, the service was created as a response to what the two men consider the inefficiency of sites like Craigslist and Backpages, where it can be hard to weed out scams.
''We represent a backlash against the Web,'' said Mr. Farrell, who is 27. ''We're trying to shift the momentum from the chaos and anonymity of Craigslist to looking someone in the face and getting a feel for the relationship right away.''
The Roommates Wanted meet-ups last for two hours and take place on the second and third Sundays of each month at bars in Astoria, Queens; Williamsburg and Prospect Heights in Brooklyn; and the East Village. They typically draw 15 to 50 people, most in their mid-20s to mid-30s, who pay a suggested donation of $5.
Upon entering, participants affix name tags (red if they have a room, green if they're looking for one). Then they mingle, chat and exchange contact information if they get along -- sort of like speed-dating for roommates. The two founders say they are open to expanding the service to other cities but are focusing on New York right now.
The main problem so far has been that not enough people offering rooms show up, said Mr. Orlick, 28. ''They have a place, so they're not as desperate.'' In response, he has started e-mailing people with rooms for rent on Craigslist, suggesting they tell interested parties to meet them at Roommates Wanted.
On a recent Sunday evening , at a meet-up at Break Bar and Billiards in Astoria, a 34-year-old waitress who had received an e-mail from Mr. Orlick was surveying the prospects. ''I'm really picky,'' she said, clutching photos of her vacant 180-square-foot bedroom. ''I want a girl or a gay guy. I'm also allergic to cats, and a bunch of people here have cats.'' She gave her name only as Jules; Roommates Wanted does not require attendees to provide last names, phone numbers or addresses.
But at least she had a roof over her head. Among the 20 or so roommate-hunters was Laura Weiss, 46, an out-of-work hairdresser recently evicted from her Chinatown apartment.
''Every time I put an ad on Craigslist I get freaks,'' Ms. Weiss said, attributing the pattern to her $400-a-month budget. ''And most people don't want pets.'' Her two cats were sleeping in a ventilated suitcase nearby.
At most events, the founders said, people without rooms will team up to search for an apartment together. James Boo, 27, a coordinator for an online education company, found a $2,675 three-bedroom in Park Slope with a publicist and a New York University graduate student he met at an event in April. ''Cleanliness was something we all actually wanted as a goal,'' Mr. Boo said by telephone, adding that they had since become good friends.
Seated on a couch at Break, Natalie Nachimson, 23, whose name tag featured crude drawings of a cat and a piano (meaning she had both), was discussing desired locations with Karyn Singer, 31, a filmmaker from Los Angeles.
''I have a lot of furniture, and I'd like to live near the R train in Woodside if possible,'' Ms. Nachimson said.
''I'm just looking for an area where I won't get stabbed,'' Ms. Singer replied, laughing.
Abel Horwitz, a 25-year-old movie producer, was sitting alone. He observed that the crowd was mostly female. ''I'm here to find a guy roommate,'' he said firmly, adding that living with a woman presented too many complexities.
In general, the crowds at Roommates Wanted tend to be evenly split between the sexes. But the type of crowd, Mr. Orlick said, varies by neighborhood. ''In Williamsburg, people are more carefree, campy, transient.''
After the Astoria event, another took place at the Alligator Lounge in Williamsburg, where discounted drinks and free pizza were on offer. Blake Martz, a junior at the University of California, San Diego, who was taking a semester off, had arrived in town only three days before. ''I'm looking for work at the moment,'' Mr. Martz said.
One woman, 23, who had an open room in her $1,600 two-bedroom down the block, was put off by Mr. Martz's precarious situation. ''A lot of people I've met here don't want to sign a lease,'' she said, ''or they're unemployed.''
Her last roommate was unemployed and turned out to be ''psychotic,'' the woman said. ''She tried to steal my dog.'' And yet, she added, the two of them had met several times -- once for drinks -- before she moved in. ''She seemed totally normal.''
''The moral of the story,'' she continued, ''is that you don't know what will happen until you actually live with somebody.''

HEADLINE: 2nd California Debate Is Tense From Start

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

 BODY:
FRESNO, Calif. -- With accusations about an illegal Mexican housekeeper dogging her campaign, the Republican candidate for governor of California, Meg Whitman, angrily blamed her Democratic challenger, Jerry Brown, for her political problems on Saturday, adding a dose of emotion to a tight race.
Ms. Whitman's remarks came in the opening moments of a second debate between the candidates, held exactly a month before Election Day. Asked about her former housekeeper, Ms. Whitman, the billionaire former chief executive of eBay, turned to Mr. Brown and said he ''should be ashamed'' of ''sacrificing Nicky Diaz on the altar of your political ambitions.'' 
The jab was a reference to Nicandra Diaz Santillan, a Mexican national who accused Ms. Whitman on Wednesday of employing Ms. Diaz Santillan despite knowing that she was not a legal resident. Ms. Whitman has said that she did not know about the status of Ms. Diaz Santillan, who worked for her for nine years, and that she fired her last year after finding out about it.
Ms. Whitman did not immediately offer any evidence to support her claims that Mr. Brown's campaign was behind accusations from the housekeeper. Mr. Brown called those claims ''incredible'' and said they showed a lack of accountability in his opponent's character.
''Don't run for governor if you can't stand up on your own two feet and say, 'Hey, I made a mistake,' '' Mr. Brown said.
The issue flared again when Ms. Whitman reiterated her position that she thought employers should be held accountable for hiring illegal workers.
''Ms. Whitman obviously didn't crack down on herself,'' Mr. Brown retorted, adding that his opponent ''was talking out of both sides of her mouth.''
Ms. Whitman later responded, ''I did hold myself accountable: It's just a lie to say that I didn't.''
The issue of accountability seemed to sting Ms. Whitman, who brought the issue up several times. At one point, Ms. Whitman turned to Mr. Brown, the state attorney general, and said that she had acted properly in firing Ms. Diaz Santillan.
''What would you have me do?'' she said. ''Would you have me call the attorney general's office?'' She then accused his campaign of circulating rumors about her housekeeper, and said he ''was joined at the hip with Gloria Allred,'' the celebrity lawyer who is representing Ms. Diaz Santillan.
The debate was held at California State University, Fresno, in the state's Central Valley, an area rich in farms and Latino voters. And indeed, the debate seemed particularly crucial for Ms. Whitman, who has been struggling to attract and to reassure Latino voters, a growing population with political clout.
Her first words in the debate were: ''The Latino vote is incredibly important to this election. I cannot win the governor's race without the Latino vote.'' She added that she had a ''significant team of Latinos working'' on her campaign.
Asked about his outreach efforts, Mr. Brown cited his past terms as governor, a post he held from 1975 to 1983, noting that he had worked with Cesar Chavez, the celebrated labor organizer, and appointed the first Latino to the State Supreme Court. He then seemingly made a veiled reference to Ms. Diaz Santillan.
''I'm going to treat everybody, whether they are documented or not, as God's child,'' he said.
Saturday's event was billed as the state's first Spanish-language debate for governor -- it was sponsored by Univision, the Spanish-language television network -- though neither candidate is fluent in Spanish. As in the first debate on Tuesday, Mr. Brown was more energetic, though Ms. Whitman, a first-time candidate who rarely strays from her talking points, was more animated on Saturday, offering a firm response when asked whether she supported allowing illegal immigrants to enroll in state colleges.
''I don't think it's fair to people who are here in California legally,'' she said. And in an area where illegal immigrants are common, Ms. Whitman maintained a hard line on those living in the country illegally.
''Illegal immigration is just that: it is illegal,'' she said.
Some of Ms. Whitman's positions -- including condemning so-called sanctuary cities, where the local authorities refuse to assist federal immigration enforcement -- are not likely to be popular with some Latino voters. A recent Field Poll showed Mr. Brown with a slight lead among Latinos, with the race deadlocked at 41 percent.
Beyond immigration, the debate also touched on water issues, a constant concern in the heavily irrigated Central Valley, and unemployment, which is at more than 12 percent statewide.
But the most dramatic moments surrounded Ms. Whitman and her relationship with Ms. Diaz Santillan. Ms. Whitman called the issue ''a very sad situation'' and suggested that Ms. Diaz Santillan was being manipulated for political gain.
''After Nov. 2,'' she said, referring to Election Day, ''nobody is going to be watching out for Nicky.''
A final question offered the only light note in an otherwise tense showdown. When each candidate was asked what qualities in the other might make a good governor, Mr. Brown smiled.
''Wow,'' he said, pausing as the audience laughed. ''This is going to be tough for both of us.''

HEADLINE: Struggling Woods Sends Shivers Rippling Through a Sport's Universe

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON and RICHARD SANDOMIR; Larry Dorman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
In 1993, the basketball world gasped when Michael Jordan retired so he could try his hand at baseball. Suddenly, the sport that he elevated to new heights had to find a new icon and marketing engine. The replacement, it turned out, was Jordan himself, who returned to the N.B.A. two years later.
The golf world faces a similar test now. Tiger Woods, perhaps the greatest golfer ever, was sidelined earlier this year by his highly publicized marital problems, and when he returned in April, failed to win a tournament, withdrew from one event and failed to make the cut at another. 
His absence and lackluster return has affected the golf world in many ways, some quantifiable and others opaque. Most noticeably, television ratings and attendance have fallen, especially at tournaments where Woods did not play. Consumers also think less of him, though whether that has caused the decline in golf equipment sales and rounds of golf played is uncertain.
The weak economy and sour housing market, particularly in Florida and Arizona, undoubtedly played a major role, too, in the decline in enthusiasm and spending this year on golf tournaments and playing of the sport. Woods could also give his tattered image -- and perhaps golf over all -- a lift if he performs well at the Ryder Cup this weekend in Wales.
Still, tournament directors, television executives, retailers and others in the industry say that golf is not the same without Woods, and that it could take a few more years for the game to regain the luster it had when Woods was at his best.
''Everybody knows that if you're fortunate enough to have him play in your event, and in particular if he wins, you benefit from that,'' said Scott Wellington, the director of the Arnold Palmer Invitational in Orlando, Fla. ''There's no question that he affects the gate at tournaments as well as tournament ratings.''
Wellington speaks from experience. Woods won the tournament (in late March) in 2008 and 2009, but without him this year, attendance was about even with last year on Thursday and Friday and slipped a bit on Saturday. Rain dampened the crowd on Sunday, then halted play; even if the weather were perfect, attendance would probably have sagged because of Woods's absence, Wellington said. Monday's final round was lightly attended.
Though complete attendance figures were unavailable, crowds were thinner at events that Woods typically attends but missed this year, including the Farmers Insurance Open in San Diego, the W.G.C.-Accenture Match Play Championship in Tucson and the W.G.C.-CA Championship in Doral, Fla.
Cheering at Woods's galleries was also more subdued and heckling not uncommon, perhaps not surprising given his fall from grace with fans and the general public.
Woods's positive Q-Score, an index that measures the popularity of celebrities, was 28 last summer, second among athletes after Jordan, who retired from basketball in 2003. But after Woods's marital problems surfaced in November, his positive Q-Score fell to 16 and his negative Q-Score rose to 50, where it remains. Woods is now the second-most-disliked athlete behind Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Michael Vick, who spent time in jail for operating a dogfighting ring.
''It will take a long time to regain the public likeability and trust and respect,'' Henry Schafer, the executive vice president at Marketing Evaluations/The Q Scores Company, said of Woods. ''Time eventually helps, but winning is a key ingredient.''
The public's distaste for Woods, who was divorced in August, has turned off some people to golf, at least for now. A survey conducted by the National Golf Foundation in July showed that 31 percent of 500 active golfers polled said they were not as interested in golf on television when Woods was not playing or was not in contention.
Ratings for the final rounds of golf tournaments -- often the most watched -- bear this out. About 10 percent fewer viewers watched tournaments on CBS and NBC this year when Woods played compared with last year. Only 2.25 million viewers watched tournaments that Woods skipped this year, less than half as many who watched tournaments that he played in. Notably, Woods did not qualify for the last of the four tournaments in the FedEx Cup playoffs.
Although television ratings are a clear barometer of fan interest in the sport and in Woods, the weaker numbers this year do not necessarily spell doom for the networks. That is because about two-thirds of the ads during tournaments are paid for by sponsors associated with the PGA Tour.
Those ads are not guaranteed, either, which means that the networks do not have to give the sponsors free commercial time if ratings fall below promised levels. Tim Finchem, the commissioner of the tour, said that he was encouraged that even with the world's top player -- Woods -- missing four months of the season, television ratings for all rounds fell just 2 percent this year. He added that the P.G.A. was still looking for sponsors for only three or four tournaments.
''The economy is the problem, not Tiger,'' Finchem said at the Tour Championship last month. ''I'll say this for maybe the 50th time: we have 47 tournaments; Tiger plays in 16.''
He did not deny, though, that having Woods return to top form would clearly help the tour. ''We want him playing, we want him playing well, and given his intensity, we assume that'll be the case,'' Finchem said.
Not only are television ratings down, but spending on clubs, bags, apparel and greens fees have also declined in 2010, victims of the recession and the overbuilding of golf courses. Still, Woods is not being blamed for the poor sales.
''There's too much of a headwind from personal finances and the overall economy and negative consumer sentiment,'' said Joseph Beditz, the president of the National Golf Foundation. ''I'd be shocked if people said, 'Oh yeah, Tiger's not on TV, forget that new driver, honey.' ''

HEADLINE: The Very Useful Idiocy of Christine O'Donnell

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
ALL it took was some 30,000 Republican primary voters in a tiny state to turn Christine O'Donnell into the brightest all-American media meteor since Balloon Boy. For embattled liberals, not to mention the axis of Comedy Central, ''Saturday Night Live'' and Bill Maher, she's been pure comic gold for weeks: a bottomless trove of baldfaced lies, radical views and sheer wackiness. True, other American politicians have dismissed evolution as a myth. Some may even have denied joining a coven. But history will always remember her for taking a fearless stand against masturbation, the one national pastime with more fans than baseball.
Yet those laughing now may not have the last laugh in November. O'Donnell's timely ascent in the election season's final lap may well prove a godsend for the G.O.P. 
At first some Republicans had trouble figuring this out. On primary eve, a spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee badmouthed O'Donnell's ''disturbing pattern of dishonest behavior.'' On election night, Karl Rove belittled her ''nutty'' pronouncements and ''checkered background'' on Fox News. But by the morning after, bygones were bygones. The senatorial committee's chairman, John Cornyn, rewarded O'Donnell's ''dishonest behavior'' with an enthusiastic endorsement and a big check. A sweaty Rove reversed himself so fast you'd think he'd been forced to stay up all night listening to Glenn Beck's greatest hits at top volume in a Roger Ailes re-education camp.
Rove's flip-flop was no doubt hastened by his own cohort's assaults on both his ideological purity and masculinity. The blogger Michelle Malkin labeled him an ''effete sore loser,'' and Sarah Palin publicly instructed him to ''buck up.'' But surely the larger motive for his retreat was the dawning recognition of just how valuable O'Donnell is to the G.O.P.'s national aspirations in November -- even should she ultimately lose her own race in blue Delaware. Whatever her other talents, she's more than willing to play the role of useful idiot for her party. She gives populist cover to the billionaires and corporate interests that have been steadily annexing the Tea Party movement and busily plotting to cash in their chips if the G.O.P. prevails.
While O'Donnell's resume has proved largely fictional, one crucial biographical plotline is true: She has had trouble finding a job, holding on to a home and paying her taxes. In this, at least, she is like many Americans in the Great Recession, including the angry claque that found its voice in the Tea Party. For a G.O.P. that is even more in thrall to big money than the Democrats, she couldn't be a more perfect decoy.
By latching on to O'Donnell's growing presence, the Rove-Boehner-McConnell establishment can claim it represents struggling middle-class Tea Partiers rather than Wall Street potentates and corporate titans. O'Donnell's value is the same as that other useful idiot, Michael Steele, who remains at the Republican National Committee only because he can wave the banner of ''diversity'' over a virtually all-white party that alternately demonizes African-Americans, Latinos, gays and Muslims.
O'Donnell is particularly needed now because most of the other Republican Tea Party standard-bearers lack genuine antigovernment or proletarian cred. Joe Miller and Ken Buck, the Senate candidates in Alaska and Colorado, actually are graduates of eliteuniversities like those O'Donnell lied about attending. Rick Scott, the populist running for governor in Florida, was chief executive of a health care corporation that scooped up so many Medicare and Medicaid payments it had to settle charges for defrauding taxpayers. Rand Paul, the scion of a congressman, is an ophthalmologist whose calls for spending restraint don't extend to his own Medicare income. Carl Paladino, the truculent man of the people in New York, grew his fortune as a developer with government handouts and favors. His California bookend, Carly Fiorina, received a golden parachute worth as much as $42 million from Hewlett-Packard, where she liquidated some 20,000 jobs.
The O'Donnell template, by sharp contrast, is Palin. It was Palin's endorsement that put O'Donnell on the map, and it's Palin's script that O'Donnell is assiduously following. The once obscure governor of Alaska was also tripped up by lies and gaffes when she emerged on the national stage, starting with her misrepresentation of her supposed opposition to ''the bridge to nowhere.'' But she quickly wove the attacks into a brilliant cloak of martyrdom that positioned her as a fierce small-town opponent of the coasts' pointy-head elites. O'Donnell, like Palin, knows that attacks by those elites, including conservative grandees, only backfire and enhance her image as a feisty defender of the aggrieved and resentful Joe Plumbers in ''real America.''
The more O'Donnell is vilified, the bigger the star she becomes, and the more she can reinforce the Tea Party's preferred narrative as ''a spontaneous and quite anarchic movement'' (in the recent words of the pundit Charles Krauthammer) populated only by everyday folk upset by big government and the deficit. This airbrushed take has had a surprisingly long life even in some of the nonpartisan press. In a typical example just three weeks ago, the influential publication National Journal delivered a breathless report on how the Tea Party functions as a ''headless'' movement where ''no one gives orders.'' To prove the point, a head of the headless Tea Party Patriots vouched that ''75 percent of the group's funding comes from small donations, $20 or less.''
In fact, local chapters of Tea Party Patriots routinely received early training and support from FreedomWorks, the moneyed libertarian outfit run by the former Republican House majority leader and corporate lobbyist Dick Armey. FreedomWorks is itself a spinoff from Citizens for a Sound Economy, a pseudo-grassroots group whose links to the billionaire Koch brothers were traced by Jane Mayer in her blockbuster August expose in The New Yorker. Last week the same Tea Party Patriots leader who bragged to the National Journal about all those small donations announced a $1 million gift from a man she would identify only as an entrepreneur. The donor's hidden identity speaks even louder than the size of the check. As long as we don't know who he is, we won't know what orders he's giving either.
Such deep-pocketed mystery benefactors -- not O'Donnell, whose reported income for this year and last is $5,800 -- are the real indicators of what's going on under the broad Tea Party rubric. Big money rains down on the ''bottom up'' Tea Party insurgency through phantom front organizations (Americans for Prosperity, Americans for Job Security) that exploit legal loopholes to keep their sugar daddies' names secret. Reporters at The Times and The Washington Post, among others, have lately made real strides in explaining how the game works. But we still don't know the identities of most of those anonymous donors.
From what we do know, it's clear that some Tea Party groups and candidates like Sharron Angle, Paul and O'Donnell are being financed directly or indirectly not just by the Kochs (who share the No. 5 spot on the new Forbes 400) but by a remarkable coterie of fellow billionaires, led by oil barons like Robert Rowling (Forbes No. 69) and Trevor Rees-Jones (No. 110). Even their largess may be dwarfed by Rupert Murdoch (No. 38) and his News Corporation, whose known cash contributions ($2 million to Republican and Republican-tilting campaign groups) are dwarfed by the avalanche of free promotion they provide Tea Party causes and personalities daily at Fox and The Wall Street Journal.
However much these corporate contributors may share the Tea Party minions' antipathy toward President Obama, their economic interests hardly overlap. The rank and file Tea Partiers say they oppose government spending and deficits. The billionaires have no problem with federal spending as long as the pork is corporate pork. They, like most Republican leaders in 2008, supported the Bush administration's Wall Street bailout. They also don't mind deficits as long as they get their outsize cut of the red ink -- $3.8 trillion worth if all the Bush tax cuts are made permanent.
But while these billionaires' selfish interests are in conflict with the Tea Party's agenda, they are in complete sync with the G.O.P.'s Washington leadership. The Republicans' new ''Pledge to America'' promises the $3.8 trillion addition to the deficit and says nothing about serious budget cuts or governmental reforms that might remotely offset it. Surfing the Beltway talk shows last Sunday, you couldn't find one without a G.O.P. politician adamantly refusing to specify a single program he might cut at, say, the Department of Education (Pell grants?) or the National Institutes of Health (cancer research?). And that's just the small change. Everyone knows that tax cuts for the G.O.P.'s wealthiest patrons must come out of Social Security and Medicare payments for everybody else.
They are acing it, these guys. Election Day is now only a month away. The demoralized Democrats are held hostage by the unemployment numbers. And along comes this marvelous gift out of nowhere, Christine O'Donnell, Tea Party everywoman, who just may be the final ingredient needed to camouflage a billionaires' coup as a populist surge. By the time her fans discover that any post-election cuts in government spending will be billed to them, and not the Tea Party's shadowy backers, she'll surely be settling her own debts with fat paychecks from ''Fox & Friends.''

HEADLINE: Being Glenn Beck

BYLINE: By MARK LEIBOVICH. 
Mark Leibovich is a reporter in the Washington bureau of The Times. He last wrote for the magazine about Mike Allen of Politico.

 BODY:
Glenn Beck was sprawled out on his office couch a couple of weeks ago, taking -- as self-helpers like to say -- an inventory. ''I think what the country is going through right now is, in a way, what I went through with my alcoholism,'' he told me. ''You can either live or die. You have a choice.'' Beck, who is 46, was in the Midtown Manhattan offices of his production company, Mercury Radio Arts, which is named for Mercury Theater, the company created by Orson Welles. He had just finished his three-hour syndicated radio show and was a few hours away from his television show. It was a Wednesday afternoon in the middle of September, and Beck had just returned from a week's vacation in the Grand Tetons followed by a quick hop to Anchorage, where he and Sarah Palin appeared at an event on Sept. 11. 
Beck has a square, boyish face, an alternately plagued and twinkle-eyed demeanor that conjures (when Beck is wearing glasses) the comedian Drew Carey. He is 6-foot-2, which is slightly jarring when you first meet him, because he is all head and doughiness on television; I never thought of Beck as big or small, just as someone who was suddenly ubiquitous and who talked a lot and said some really astonishing things, to a point where it made you wonder -- constantly -- whether he was being serious.
At some point in the past few months, Beck ceased being just the guy who cries a lot on Fox News or a ''rodeo clown'' (as he has described himself) or simply a voice of the ultraconservative opposition to President Obama. In record time, Beck has traveled the loop of curiosity to ratings bonanza to self-parody to sage. It is remarkable to think he has been on Fox News only since January 2009.
In person, Beck is sheepish and approachable, betraying none of the grandiosity or bluster you might expect from a man who predicted ''the next Great Awakening'' to a few hundred thousand people in late August at the Lincoln Memorial or who declared last year that the president has a ''deep-seated hatred for white people or the white culture.'' He wore a blue dress shirt tucked into jeans and brown loafers, which he kicked off as soon as he sat down. He showed little interest in the results from primary elections held the day before -- upsets in Delaware and New York for Tea Party candidates whose followers often invoke Beck and Palin as spiritual leaders and even promote them as a prospective presidential ticket in 2012.
''Not involved with the Tea Party,'' Beck told me, shrugging. While many identify Beck with a political insurgency -- as Rush Limbaugh was identified with the Republican sweep of 1994 -- to believe that the nation suffers from ''a political problem'' comically understates things, in his view. ''I stand with the Tea Party as long as they stand for certain principles and values,'' Beck told me. He is a principles-and-values guy.
Beck talks like someone who is accustomed to thinking out loud and inflicting his revelations in real time. He speaks in the language of therapy, in which he has been steeped through years of 12-step programs and the Mormon-affiliated addiction-treatment center he and his wife run in the New York, New Jersey and Connecticut region. As he lay on his office couch, he recalled a very low moment. It was back in the mid-1990s. He was newly divorced, lying on the olive green shag carpet of a two-bedroom apartment in Hamden, Conn., that smelled like soup. It had a tiny kitchen, and his young children slept in a bed together when they visited on weekends. ''It was the kind of place where loser guys who just got divorced wind up,'' Beck said. ''You'd see a new guy come in, you'd say hello and he'd walk in alone, and you'd be like, 'Yeah, I understand, brother.' ''
Beck understands, brother. Communists in the White House are bent on ''fundamentally transforming'' the country; progressives speak of putting ''the common good'' before the individual, which ''is exactly the kind of talk that led to the death camps in Germany,'' as he said on his show in May. Or, as he said in July of last year, ''Everything that is getting pushed through Congress, including this health care bill,'' is ''driven by President Obama's thinking on . . . reparations'' and his desire to ''settle old racial scores.'' It sounds harsh, maybe, but this is the rhetoric of crisis and desperation, and so much of the population is too blind drunk to recognize the reality -- which is that the country is lying on an olive green shag carpet on the brink of ending it all. ''Some have to destroy their family and their job and their house and their income,'' Beck told me. ''Some don't get it, and they die.''
Some do get it, and they revere Glenn Beck.
WHILE THE RIGHT has traditionally responded to its aggrieved sense of alienation with anger, Beck is not particularly angry. He seems sorrowful; his prevailing message is umbrage born of self-taught wisdom. He is more agonized than mad. He is post-angry.
Beck rarely speaks with the squinty-eyed certainty or smugness of Rush Limbaugh or his fellow Fox News hosts Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity. He often changes his mind or nakedly contradicts himself. ''When you listen and watch me, it's where I am in my thinking in the moment,'' Beck told me. ''I'm trying to figure it out as I go.'' He will sometimes stop midsentence and recognize that something he is about to say could be misunderstood and could cause him trouble. Then, more often than not, he will say it anyway.
In the middle of his analogy to me about his own personal crash and the country's need to heal itself, Beck looked at his publicist with a flash of alarm about how I might construe what he was saying. ''He is going to write a story that I believe the whole country is alcoholics,'' he said. And then he went on to essentially compare his ''Restoring Honor'' pageant at the Lincoln Memorial to a large-scale A.A. meeting. ''When I bottomed out, I couldn't put it back together myself,'' Beck told me. ''I could do all the hard work. I could do the 12 steps. But I needed like-minded people around me.''
He needed support, just as responsible Americans need it now to reinforce the principles and values that the founders instilled and that, he says, have since decayed. ''You need people to be able to reach out and connect and say, 'Let me help hold you when you're stumbling, and you hold me when I'm stumbling, because what we're going through now is a storm of confusion.' '' Fans approach Beck and give him hugs. Do people feel they can hug Limbaugh?
There is something feminine about Beck -- the soft features, the crying on the air, the reflexive vulnerability. It sets him apart from the standard, testosterone-addled rant artists of cable and talk radio. Women tune into Beck's radio show more heavily than they do to other conservative commentators, says Chris Balfe, the president and chief operating officer of Mercury, which employs more than 40 people. And Beck's television show is on at 5 p.m. Eastern, traditionally a slot with more women viewers. (On a typical day, Beck's show is recorded on more DVRs than any other cable-news program.) But Beck also appeals to a more traditionally female sensibility. ''He works through things in real time,'' Balfe told me. ''Maybe he'll come back tomorrow and say, 'You know what, I've given this some thought, and here's what I'm thinking now.' '' Or maybe he'll come back sooner. Within a few sentences of proposing Obama's ''deep-seated hatred for white people,'' he added this caveat: ''I'm not saying that he doesn't like white people.''
Beck's staff and loyalists love to compare Beck with Oprah Winfrey. Balfe was the first to say it to me, adding the requisite faux apology. As Winfrey does, Beck talks a great deal about himself and subscribes to the pop-recovery ethic. ''Part of Oprah's appeal is that people see her as a real person,'' says Joel Cheatwood, the Fox executive who initially brought Beck to CNN's Headline News and then to Fox. ''She has struggled with her weight; she is open about it. Glenn is not a pretty boy. He comes off as a regular guy who has also been open about his struggles.'' (Beck dabbled in Pilates recently, he disclosed on radio.)
The presumed Oprah parallel is corporate as well as stylistic. Beck, like Winfrey, has a knack for making best sellers of books he mentions on the air. He publishes a magazine, sells more than a million dollars in merchandise and speaks of an array of possible multimedia ventures. Beck's magazine, Fusion, is so named because it is a ''fusion of entertainment and enlightenment.'' Beck himself is a study in fusions. He blends TV-ready empathy with push-the-edge conservative talk, as well as self-doubt with the self-absorbed grandeur of a man whose hard-won recovery grants him the power to speak from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.
Beck is constantly admitting his weaknesses and failures, which he wields as both a crutch and a shield. ''Maybe Glenn's transparency is what keeps him out of trouble,'' says Robert Beath, Beck's drama teacher at Sehome High School in Bellingham, Wash. Beath, who was fond of Beck as a teenager, said Beck appears to now think that his revelations grant him license. ''When he says, 'I am not perfect,' he seems to escape accountability for his various points of view. Yet he expects others to be accountable for their point of view without seeming to allow them the 'I am not perfect' exception.''
That's where the Winfrey comparison falls apart. You could never imagine her joking about poisoning the speaker of the house or talking about choking the life out of a filmmaker or fantasizing about beating a congressman ''to death with a shovel'' (as Beck did for Nancy Pelosi, Michael Moore and Charles Rangel, respectively). Beck is divisive.
''He has a spiritual connection to us; you can hear his heart speaking,'' Susan Trevethan, a psychiatric nurse from Milford, Conn., told me at the ''Restoring Honor'' rally. ''I believe he has been divinely guided to be here in this place,'' she said. ''He is doing the research. He is teaching us.''
Or if you prefer: ''Even the leather-winged shouting heads at Fox News look like intellectual giants next to this bleating, benighted Cassandra,'' wrote The Buffalo Beast, in naming Beck one of the 50 most loathsome people in America in 2006. (No. 24 then, but in January he made it to No. 1.) ''It's like someone found a manic, doom-prophesying hobo in a sandwich board, shaved him, shot him full of Zoloft and gave him a show.''
O.K., the dude's polarizing. Got it.
The Mercury Radio Arts headquarters are a museum to Beck's quirks, aspirations, successes and self. Poster-size color photos of Beck, taken by his personal photographer, George Lange, dominate the lobby. One features Beck wrapped up head to toe in yellow police tape; another has him dressed and made up like a rodeo clown. The offices evoke the self-image of a multimedia entrepreneur and would-be titan: portraits of Orson Welles, Ronald Reagan and Walt Disney hang on the walls. Balfe, the chief executive, keeps a massive red-and-blue ''Capitalism'' poster above his desk -- hand-painted by Beck.
Next door to Balfe's office is Beck's, which is spacious, sun-filled and arrayed with family photos, books and a yellowed copy of The Boston Post with the headline ''Woodrow Wilson Is Dead.'' His computer flashes with alternating screen savers of his second wife, Tania, and his four children -- two from each marriage -- along with photos of landmarks like Pike Place Market in Seattle, near where Beck grew up.
Beck can be difficult to get to. He is acutely conscious of his personal safety. He feels targeted. Security guards trail him on the street. He wears bulletproof vests at public events. He wanted to build a six-foot barrier around his estate in New Canaan, Conn., running him afoul of local zoning ordinances. The barrier would not stop those who would do him harm, Beck's lawyer told New Canaan's zoning commission, but it would slow them down. ''It will stop anything people send into the property, whether photographs or bullets,'' the lawyer said, according to The New Canaan Advertiser.
Beck says he trusts very few people. He gives few interviews. I first spoke to him by phone, a few days after the rally in Washington. He sounded thrilled -- on the phone, as he did on the air that week -- with how everything went on Aug. 28. But he never seems far from the precipice of something. It is all precarious.
''I said to someone the other day,'' Beck told me, ''I am as close today to a complete and total collapse as I was on the first day of recovery.'' He calls himself a ''recovering dirtbag.'' There were many days, he said, when he would avoid the bathroom mirror so he would not have to face himself. He was in therapy with ''Dr. Jack Daniels.'' He smoked marijuana every day for about 15 years. He fired an underling for bringing him the wrong pen. And, according to a Salon.com report, he once called the wife of a radio rival to ridicule her -- on the air -- about her recent miscarriage.
''You get to a place where you disgust yourself,'' Beck told me. ''Where you realize what a weak, pathetic and despicable person you have become.''
Beck grew up in Mount Vernon, Wash., about 50 miles north of Seattle. He was an unfocused student with discrete passions and talents who could have benefited from a more stable home environment -- and a prescription for Ritalin. His love affair with radio began, he says, when his mother gave him an album set of radio classics that included Welles's ''War of the Worlds.'' He was 8 and spent much of his free time honing his radio voice into a tape recorder.
Bill and Mary Beck, Glenn's parents, owned a bakery in Mount Vernon that eventually closed. The couple divorced when Glenn was 13, and Mary Beck, who battled alcoholism, drowned a few years later along with a male companion on a boating expedition in 1979 on a bay near Tacoma. Beck deemed her death a suicide (though local newspapers and government records called it an accident, according to Salon.com's Alexander Zaitchik). Beck was 15 then, and he says the episode sank him into decades of misery, chemical dependence and misanthropic behavior that played out on and off the air at a procession of FM stations across the country -- morning-D.J. jobs in markets like Provo, Utah; Phoenix; Corpus Christi, Tex.; and New Haven, where he hit bottom.
I asked Beck if he could pinpoint the moment he decided to change his life. ''Here's something I haven't told anyone before,'' Beck said. ''When my mother was at her worst, she was dating a guy who was abusive. He was a big Navy guy too.'' It was right at the end of her life. Glenn got between his mother and the man during an ugly fight. ''I just came in and stood between them and said, 'Get out of our house.' '' The man left, but he came back a few days later and begged forgiveness. ''When I sobered up, I remember looking back to that point,'' Beck told me. ''Something I learned still kind of plays a role.'' He went on to say: ''One of the phrases I use is: You need to be who you were born to be, not the people we have allowed ourselves to become. Don't let life and the world shape us. That's not who we are.''
I asked Beck how he knew that his mother's death was a suicide. The man who drowned with her was that same abusive boyfriend, he said. Either the two of them jumped overboard at the same time, or Mary fell in and the Navy man jumped in to save her -- and that was unlikely. Why? Beck said he been out on a boat with the boyfriend before, and the man preached to him never to jump in and save somebody who is drowning. It only endangers the would-be rescuer. Throw in a life preserver instead. Plus, the Navy man's clothes were found neatly folded, along with his wallet and watch.
AT JUST 21, Beck took a job as a morning-drive impresario in Louisville. His show, ''Captain Beck and the A-Team,'' included the usual antics of the genre: juvenile jokes, pranks, impersonations, sound effects and fat jokes about a news reader for a rival station -- anything to fill the four hours.
By most accounts, Beck succeeded; but by his own, he was miserable. ''There was a bridge abutment in Louisville, Ky., that had my name on it,'' Beck wrote in his 2003 book, ''Real America: Messages From the Heart and Heartland.'' ''Every day I prayed for the strength to be able to drive my car at 70 m.p.h. into that bridge abutment.'' He says he contemplated only violent suicides (''like the bridge abutment thing and putting a gun in my mouth while listening to Nirvana''). He attributes his inability to off himself to cowardice and stupidity -- qualities that also suited him to his tour of Morning Zoo America. ''I hated people,'' Beck wrote, waxing pop-psychological, ''because I hated myself.''
By the mid-'90s, Beck had been married, divorced, pony tailed and seemingly at a dead end. He joined Alcoholics Anonymous, reluctantly attending his first meetings in a church basement in Cheshire, Conn. The olive-green-carpet episode was formative but not a singular turning point. ''It was more a point of recognition,'' Beck told me. ''Are you going to stand or are you going to grow up? Are you going to succeed or fail, live or die? What is it going to be? There weren't any angels or the sky opening up.'' He embarked on a period of ''searching'' and self-education. The process was largely haphazard. He tells of walking into a bookstore and loading up on books by a hodgepodge that included Alan Dershowitz, Pope John Paul II, Carl Sagan, Nietzsche, Billy Graham and Adolf Hitler. ''The library of a serial killer,'' he called it. He even enrolled at Yale, with a written recommendation from an alum who was a listener at the time, Senator Joe Lieberman. He took one class, early Christology, but says he ''spent more time trying to find a parking space'' than in class and quickly dropped out.
Beck met Tania in 1998. She walked into the New Haven radio station where he was working to pick up a Sony Walkman she won in a contest. They began dating. He wanted to marry, and she agreed, but only on the condition that they find a religion together. They shopped around, attended services and eventually settled on Mormonism -- inspired in part by Beck's best friend and radio sidekick, Pat Gray, who himself is Mormon. Beck, who was brought up Roman Catholic, has called his faith ''the most important thing'' in his life.
By the late 1990s, Beck had come to despise the FM zoo format. He was becoming more spiritual, more engaged in news and current affairs and more opinionated on the air about his political views (generally conservative then, though not as much as now -- he favored abortion rights at the time). He was a connoisseur of talk radio and yearned to break into the genre.
Beck moved to Tampa, Fla., in late 1999 -- leaving his two daughters back in Connecticut -- to host his first talk-radio show, an afternoon slot on WFLA. ''I may have made the biggest mistake of my life in taking this job,'' Beck recalls saying during his first segment on the air. ''Because I've just made a pact that I was going to leave my children in Connecticut and move to Florida, and it's killing me. I may have traded my children for this job.''
Beck's radio show was heavily political but not exclusively. It was more stream of consciousness -- veering in unforeseen directions, as reflected in the first segment. ''I found it to be a very 'Seinfeld'-like radio program,'' says Kraig Kitchin, the former president of Premiere Radio Networks, who signed Beck to a national-syndication deal. ''There was one main plot streaming through the program and two or three subplots.''
Joel Cheatwood, then the executive director of program development for CNN and Headline News, heard Beck's radio show in late 2004, when Beck was on the air in Philadelphia, and said he believed that the host could translate to television. Cheatwood, a controversial innovator of television news, pioneered the flashy ''if it bleeds, it leads'' local-news formats. He persuaded Beck to join Headline News in 2006. As with his first stint in Tampa, Beck had early doubts. ''Glenn had been on the air for about three weeks,'' recalled Cheatwood, who has one of the most thrillingly sculptured waves of slicked-back hair I have ever seen. ''He came into my office and said something like, 'This is kind of a disaster,' and he was right.'' Beck struggled to adapt his radio persona to the regimented bites of television. ''It was all over the board,'' Cheatwood says of the early Headline News show.
Beck compares his free-associative radio orientation to the real-time oversharing ethic of today's culture. ''My life is what I think our children are going though with Facebook,'' he told me. ''They're putting things up there, because they're living their life, and everybody's doing it.'' Eventually Beck learned to harness his talent to the demands of television, at least somewhat. His best-known episode at Headline News was a November 2006 interview with Keith Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota, who had just become the first Muslim elected to the House. ''I have to tell you, I have been nervous about this interview with you,'' Beck told Ellison to break the ice. ''Because what I feel like saying is, 'Sir, prove to me that you are not working with our enemies.' And I know you're not. I'm not accusing you of being an enemy, but that's the way I feel, and I think a lot of Americans will feel that way.'' Groups complained, Beck expressed regret for ''a poorly worded question'' and Jon Stewart played the clip on ''The Daily Show.'' ''Finally,'' Stewart said, ''a guy who says what people who aren't thinking are thinking.''
BECK WAS LURED to Fox News by the prospect of more viewers and a recruiting pitch by Cheatwood -- who had since moved there -- and the network's president, Roger Ailes. He began his Fox News show the day before Barack Obama's inauguration.
People watch Beck in remarkable numbers, at least by the standards of his time slot on cable news -- he averages more than two million viewers, whether the topic is a founding father, an obscure president or a little-known White House administrator.
''If you were in an imaginary meeting for a TV show,'' Bill Shine, Fox News's programming director, says, ''and someone said: 'I have an idea. Let's spend a month talking about the founding fathers and get a bunch of pictures of Benjamin Franklin and hang them up,' you'd be like, 'What?' But it works.'' Beck fashions himself a kind of self-teaching populist for the Internet age. His characteristic chalkboard lends his show an air of retro-professorial authority, despite the fact that Beck did not attend college and says that before Sept. 11, 2001, ''I didn't know my butt from my elbow.'' He recommends books. He recently started ''Glenn Beck University,'' a special collection of ''classes'' on GlennBeck.com to go with Beck's daily tutorials. Pat Gray said Beck was ''America's history professor.''
''Beck offers a story about the American past for people who are feeling right now very angry and alienated,'' says David Frum, a former speechwriter for President George W. Bush and editor of the conservative Web site Frum Forum. ''It is different enough from the usual story in that he makes them feel like they've got access to secret knowledge.''
Beck's Fox News show intersperses history with weeping laments, melodramatic calls to faith and vehement attacks on ''progressives.'' He also mixes in campy stage props and laughs straight from the Morning Zoo playbook. One moment, he is giving an impassioned plea for the would-be builder of Park51 to build elsewhere; the next moment, he is discussing possible names for a hypothetical Islam-friendly gay bar next door (''Turban Cowboy,'' ''You Mecca Me Hot'').
''I find it riveting to watch,'' says Anita Dunn, the former White House communications director whom Beck railed against prodigiously on the air last year after she named Mother Teresa and Mao Zedong as her ''favorite political philosophers'' (she says she was joking about Mao) in a commencement address. ''There is that edge where you are always thinking, Is he going to totally lose it on camera?'' Dunn told me.
The ethos of Beck's program is extreme doom and pessimism. In a lead-in to Beck's show, Shepard Smith referred to his fellow host's studio as ''the Fear Chamber.'' This is another departure from the Limbaugh formula. ''Rush is basically of a quite optimistic creed,'' Frum says. ''It's the Reagan creed: America's best days are still to come. If we maintain the free-enterprise system, we're all going to be richer and more united and stronger. With Beck, there is no optimism.''
On Fox News in early September, Beck stood in a mock doorway painted gold. When the country's economic system reaches ''the point of insanity,'' he said, it is wise to invest in gold. ''Gold prices are climbing,'' Beck said, a point buttressed throughout the hour by advertisements from gold dealers. On the other side of the golden doorway is where things get really scary, he said. Who knows what dark, apocalyptic things are there? ''Is it bullets?'' Beck wondered. ''Is it whiskey? Is it cigarettes?''
Beck often speaks of -- and is teased about -- his ''bunker,'' where he will retreat after the social fabric rends and the economic system collapses. Some of his most devoted advertisers include companies that could thrive in a period of total collapse -- makers of emergency power generators, for instance, or ''survival seeds'' (allowing citizens to grow their own food).
I asked Beck if he actually had a bunker. No, he said, there is no bunker. He does keep a great deal of food in reserve, although he says that predates his fear that the world would melt down. Food storage is a tenet of his Mormon faith, he said. It is for when tough times come.
''Am I actively engaged in survival training?'' he told me. ''No. Should I be? Maybe.''
BECK PERFORMS MORE than 20 live stage shows a year as part of what has become a growing multimedia and merchandising empire that, according to Forbes, earned $35 million between June 2009 and June 2010. At the end of July, I paid $147 for a ticket to see him and Bill O'Reilly perform together at a theater in the round in Westbury, N.Y., on Long Island -- part of Beck and O'Reilly's ''Bold and Fresh'' tour. The theater drew an orderly suburban procession of khaki-wearing, Camry-driving Caucasians who say they want their country back. The woman next to me complained that her large oil can of Heineken and a pretzel cost $16. Air Supply played there a few days earlier.
Beck and O'Reilly each spoke solo for about 40 minutes, followed by a conversational duet by the two Fox News hosts. The sets mingled stand-up comedy with political rants and, in Beck's case, a history sermon. It included a call for America to return to the spirit of ''divine providence'' that the founders intended -- before it was perverted by Manifest Destiny in the mid-19th century. ''We've lost our way since Andrew Jackson,'' said Beck, who wore an unlaced pair of black Chuck Taylor sneakers. ''Manifest Destiny is 'Get out of my way, I'm on a mission from God.' That's where we went wrong. We must humble ourselves.''
Later, Beck and O'Reilly did a riff about Chelsea Clinton's wedding, which was being held that night.
''What are the odds of Hillary Clinton inviting me to her daughter's wedding?'' O'Reilly asked Beck.
''What are the odds we have a Communist revolutionary in the White House?'' Beck replied, to loud applause.
A recurring theme of the evening was Beck and O'Reilly talking about how despised they are by venomous critics bent on silencing them. Both wear this ''constant abuse'' as a badge of honor and defiance, although, unlike O'Reilly, Beck will betray vulnerability, even woundedness. ''They want to destroy you, get you off the air,'' O'Reilly told Beck. ''And I want to know if that bothers you?''
''It bothers me when I walk down the street with my children,'' Beck said, ''and my college-age daughter is holding my hand, and someone says something horribly vicious. And my daughter hears them, cries and says to me, 'Dad, all I wish is that people will remember that you are a dad occasionally as well.' '' (This was several weeks after Beck apologized for doing an extended imitation of then-11-year-old Malia Obama on his radio show. ''Daddy,'' Beck said, mimicking the president's daughter, ''why do you hate black people so much?'')
Beck seemed to draw more fans than O'Reilly, despite O'Reilly's home-field advantage on his native Long Island. ''He is a modern-day prophet doing God's work,'' a man named Lee Hein told me. He resides in Hawaii, where he wakes at 3 a.m. to hear a live stream of Beck's radio show on the Internet. Hein, a plumbing contractor, recently purchased three copies of Beck's novel ''The Overton Window,'' five copies of his book ''Glenn Beck's Common Sense'' and three copies of ''Arguing With Idiots.'' He likes to give the books out to educate his friends.
Several people at Beck's events described themselves as ''students of history'' or ''historians.'' When I asked one if he was affiliated with a school or college, he said: ''Yes. Glenn Beck University.''
WHEN BECK MEETS his fans, he does so with the gusto of a public figure engaging his constituents. People he meets often give him presents and notes. He signs autographs, poses for photos. He has perfected the Everyman shtick that presidential candidates spend years trying to master in places like Iowa. No doubt, someone loyal to Beck will read that and say, 'No, no, it's not a shtick.' Like many famous performers, Beck is described by friends and supplicants as someone who is authentic and real, that what you see is what you get. (It's usually their public-relations person who says this.)
On the Thursday night before his Saturday bar mitzvah at the Lincoln Memorial, Beck walked around the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in anticipation of a ''Divine Destiny'' event he would host the next night. ''Divine Destiny'' featured music, speeches and testimonials from a procession of prominent spiritual teachers -- priests, pastors, rabbis, Chuck Norris.
Free tickets to ''Divine Destiny'' were triple hot, like the concert passes Beck used to give away to the 23rd caller on the Morning Zoo. People lined up outside in hopes of getting tickets. Beck came out to say hello. Tania Beck handed out pizza. Beck wore a blue baseball cap, pink shirt and thick-rimmed glasses. He looked like a square dad checking in on the kids at a sleepover. ''Do you smell the pizza?'' he asked. People greeted him with shrieks, whoops and gasps.
''Are you the first in line?'' Beck asked a man with a crew cut and wispy beard from Fayetteville, Ark.
''Yes, sir,'' the man said.
Beck had a special prize for the man. ''I haven't given this to anybody,'' Beck said. It was a Badge of Merit, an award Beck modeled on the Purple Heart-like token that George Washington bestowed for meritorious conduct (for, say, valor in a war or the commitment required to score free tickets).
Beck hugged his way through the line. People were moved, some tearful. ''It's such an honor,'' a woman said softly, hugging him. ''God bless you, man,'' a guy in a Dallas Cowboys shirt said. ''Thank you for giving us a voice,'' another woman added.
''We hate Woodrow Wilson,'' another woman called out. This is like a secret handshake among Beck followers, who have heard his diatribes about the evils of our 28th president, a father of the Progressive Era. ''I hate him,'' Beck affirmed for the Woodrow Wilson-hating women at the Kennedy Center. ''I hate that guy.''
A mother asked him to pose for a photo with her and her autistic child who, the mother says, watches Beck every day. Like Palin, Beck has a special-needs child -- a daughter, Mary, who has cerebral palsy -- and he often hears from parents who have dealt with similar circumstances.
Beck then stopped and addressed a section of the line. ''Do you guys know what's going on here tonight?'' Beck asked them.
''Magic,'' answered a woman in an orange T-shirt. ''Miracles.''
''There are 2,400 seats,'' Beck explained. ''Most of them will be pastors and priests and rabbis. And it's the beginning.''
He started to cry.
''It's the beginning of the. . . .'' He choked up, making it hard to make out his words.
''It's going to be neat,'' he finally mustered.
Beck seems able to cry on cue. He says he is a softie who is prone to crying during television commercials. He is an emotional person, Balfe says, which speaks to his sincerity and the reason that people are so quick to identify with him.
As Beck worked the Kennedy Center, his every move was captured by a videographer who was with him during his trip to Washington. I watched the intimate event from my desktop -- it was linked on GlennBeck.com and available to premium ''insider extreme'' subscribers ($9.95 a month). It was one of the many times I found myself wondering whether this was real, part of the show or some fusion of both.
ON THE AIR and in person, Beck often goes on long stretches that are warm, conciliatory and even plaintive. He says he yearns for the cohesion in the country after Sept. 11, 2001, and will speak in paragraphs that could fit into Barack Obama's plea for national unity in his speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention. ''There's a lot we can disagree on, but our values and principles can unite us,'' Beck said from the Lincoln Memorial.
But ''standing together'' can be a tough sell from someone who is so willing to pick at some of the nation's most tender scabs. Beck's statement that the president's legislative agenda is driven by Obama's desire for ''reparations'' and his ''desire to settle old racial scores'' is hardly a uniting message. While public figures tend to eventually learn (some the hard way) that Nazi, Hitler and Holocaust comparisons inevitably offend a lot of people, Beck seems not to care. In a forthcoming book about Beck, ''Tears of a Clown,'' the Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank writes that in the first 14 months of Beck's Fox News show, Beck and his guests mentioned fascism 172 times, Nazis 134 times, Hitler 115 times, the Holocaust 58 times and Joseph Goebbels 8 times.
In his quest to root out progressives, Beck compared himself to Israeli Nazi-hunters. ''To the day I die I am going to be a progressive-hunter,'' he vowed on his radio show earlier this year. ''I'm going to find these people that have done this to our country and expose them. I don't care if they're in nursing homes.''
''Raising questions'' is Beck's favorite rhetorical method. Last year during the health care debate, Beck compared Obama's economic agenda to Nazi Germany -- specifically he paralleled the White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel's statement that ''you never want a serious crisis to go to waste'' with how Hitler used the world economic crisis as a pivot point. Photos of Hitler, Stalin and Lenin then appeared on screen. ''Is this where we're headed?'' Beck asked. He allowed that ''I am not predicting that we go down that road.''
President Obama is not a Muslim, Beck has said, correctly. But Beck can't help wondering aloud on his show: ''He needlessly throws his hat into the ring to defend the ground-zero mosque. He hosts Ramadan dinners, which a president can do. But then you just add all of this stuff up -- his wife goes against the advice of the advisers, jets to Spain for vacation. What does she do there? She hits up the Alhambra palace mosque. Fine, it's a tourist attraction. But is there anything more to this? Are they sending messages? I don't know. I don't know.''
Beck and his friends emphasize that he is driven by principles, not politics. He has been critical of Republicans as well as of Democrats, of George W. Bush as well as of Obama. He says that American citizens who are terrorist suspects should be read their Miranda rights, and he opposes a Constitutional amendment that would ban flag-burning. His friends object to any hint that Beck has merely fashioned his worldview according to a marketplace that rewards shock, chutzpah and discord. ''If you know Glenn at all, you know he believes every word of what he says,'' Chris Balfe says. ''And he believes it down to the core of who he is.''
Beck is also a showman at his core and a workaholic. His insomniac mind spins with ideas for segments and revenue streams (which he will duly e-mail to his staff at 3 in the morning). He sleeps little: three, maybe five hours a night if he is lucky, Beck told me. His Mormonism forbids coffee, but he consumes a lot of Diet Coke and chocolate.
He begins his day with a 7:30 meeting with about six or seven writers, researchers and producers split between the television and radio teams. Beck, who runs the meeting, throws out ideas for the show, and the staff will discuss them. ''When he walks in, he has about 60 percent of what he wants to talk about mapped out in his brain,'' says Steve Burguiere, a Beck radio sidekick who goes by the name Stu. That, Burguiere says, will form the basic kernel of what he will talk about on the air. I asked Burguiere if Beck worked from a script, which made him chuckle. ''If we could only get him to work from a script,'' he said.
BECK IS A STRENUOUS cross-promoter. He spoke constantly on the air about his Washington rally before and after the event. He invites viewers and listeners to visit his Web site and, better yet, the Glenn Beck Store (''Restoring Honor'' photograph books can be preordered for $35) and become an ''insider extreme'' member for premium video and audio links. He recently started a new Web site, the Blaze, which he also mentions on his television and radio shows.
The cross-promotion can be a sore spot at Fox News, particularly for its president, Roger Ailes, who has complained about Beck's hawking his non-Fox ventures too much on his Fox show. Ailes has communicated this to Beck himself and through intermediaries. It goes to a larger tension between Fox News and Beck in what has been a mutually beneficial relationship. Ailes, a former Republican media guru, runs his top-rated cable-news network like a sharp-edged campaign, speaking with a single voice and -- ideally -- for the benefit solely of Fox News's bottom line.
To some degree, all of Fox News's top opinion personalities have side ventures -- speeches, books, radio -- that can invite static from the network. In April, for instance, Fox News bosses vetoed a planned appearance by Hannity at a fund-raiser for a Tea Party group in Cincinnati. But more than any other person at Fox News, Beck operates as a stand-alone entity. He is the only major personality at the network whose office is not at Fox News headquarters in the News Corp building (Mercury is a few blocks down Sixth Avenue). He employs his own publicist, Matthew Hiltzik, a communications consultant who is the son of Beck's agent, George Hiltzik. Beck receives a $2.5 million salary from Fox News, which bumps to $2.7 million next year, the last of the contract. It is a small fraction of Beck's revenues, the bulk of which he brings in from his radio and print deals.
''There is always going to be the person within the organization who may take issue with or doesn't like the way the network is programming certain things,'' says Cheatwood, the Fox News executive who oversees Beck's show. ''I allow for that anywhere. But in terms of the relationship between Fox and Glenn, it's extremely solid.''
Ailes, who declined to comment for this article, has generally been supportive of Beck. But he has also been vocal around the network about how Beck does not fully appreciate the degree to which Fox News has made him the sensation he has become in recent months. In the days following Beck's Lincoln Memorial rally, which by Beck's estimate drew a half-million people, Ailes told associates that if Beck were still at Headline News, there would have been 30 people on the Mall. Fox News devoted less news coverage to the rally than CNN and MSNBC did, which Beck has pointed out himself on the air.
Off-the-record sniping shoots in both directions. You can view some of this as positioning for what could be a contentious contract negotiation. But the friction is evident in many areas. When I mentioned Beck's name to several Fox reporters, personalities and staff members, it reliably elicited either a sigh or an eye roll. Several Fox News journalists have complained that Beck's antics are embarrassing Fox, that his inflammatory rhetoric makes it difficult for the network to present itself as a legitimate news outlet. Fearful that Beck was becoming the perceived face of Fox News, some network insiders leaked their dissatisfaction in March to The Washington Post's media critic, Howard Kurtz, a highly unusual breach at a place where complaints of internal strains rarely go public.
While Beck's personal ventures and exposure have soared this year, his television ratings have declined sharply -- perhaps another factor in the network's impatience. His show now averages two million viewers, down from a high of 2.8 million in 2009, according to the Nielsen Ratings. And as of Sept. 21, 296 advertisers have asked that their commercials not be shown on Beck's show (up from 26 in August 2009). Fox also has a difficult time selling ads on ''The O'Reilly Factor'' and ''Fox and Friends'' when Beck appears on those shows as a guest. Beck's show is known in the TV sales world as ''empty calories,'' meaning he draws great ratings but is toxic for ad sales. If nothing else, I sensed that people around Fox News have grown weary after months of ''It's all about Glenn.'' I was sitting with Bill Shine, the director of programming, on the Wednesday after the ''Restoring Honor'' event, which was held on a Saturday and still drawing analysis in the news media four days later. At the end of a half-hour interview in which Shine spoke well of Beck, a look of slight irritation flashed his face. He shook his head slightly. ''The president of the United States ends the war in Iraq,'' Shine said, which Obama did the night before in a speech from the Oval Office, ''and on Wednesday we're still talking about Glenn Beck.''
NO ONE SEEMS to quite know what to make of Beck these days. On ''Fox News Sunday'' the day after the ''Restoring Honor'' gathering, Chris Wallace asked him, ''What are you?''
Beck appears conflicted over whether he wants to be the face of Honor Restored or the voice of a Great American Freakout or whether some fusion of the two is possible. He told me that he has enjoyed himself more since Aug. 28, an event that included no references to contemporary politics. It is not clear if this new tenor is a trend or phase or whether Beck is in the midst of a fundamental transformation. ''I'm a work in progress, man,'' he told me. ''I don't know how to make this transition.'' It has become a nagging preoccupation. ''I wrote Sarah Palin a letter last night about 2 in the morning,'' Beck said on his radio show in September. ''And I said: 'Sarah, I don't know if I'm doing more harm or more good. I don't know anymore.' ''
Beck has made a determination in recent months, Cheatwood told me. ''I think what he's realizing is you have to be careful not to just be part of the noise. You have to transcend the noise.'' In the weeks after the ''Restoring Honor'' rally, Beck's Fox News show took a decidedly spiritual, historic and even high-minded tone. But near the end of September, Beck returned to a more accustomed noise level. He railed against the ''clear and present danger'' of progressive ideology and attacked the Obama administration more savagely than he had in some time, singling out Cass Sunstein, the White House's regulatory czar, as ''the most dangerous man in America.''
On Sept. 11, I traveled to Anchorage to watch Beck and Palin perform together at a downtown civic center. A woman outside carried a sign calling Beck and Palin ''the dream team,'' while another dismissed them as ''lipstick and dipstick.''
The crowd was loud and even festive, despite the somber anniversary. Palin spoke first and then introduced Beck. The pair stage-chatted for about 20 minutes before Palin turned over the stage to Beck. He spoke -- with chalkboards -- for more than an hour. Sitting in the row behind me was a truck driver named Jerry Cole, who was from Fairbanks and wore an ''I (heart) Woodrow Wilson'' T-shirt with a slash through the heart. ''He was the start of the Progressive Era,'' Cole said of the long-dead president. ''He believed that college intellectuals should decide how the world should be run.''
Beck's Anchorage show started late -- around 9 p.m. -- and Beck was still speaking as 11 o'clock approached. He kept going, and going, and delivered a stem-winding ending about how George Washington became terrified at the end of his life about doing something that would dishonor himself and his country. I looked around the crowd of about 4,000, and it seemed no one had left. The room was perfectly silent after two hours plus -- late on a Saturday night -- to hear a self-described ''recovering dirtbag'' with not a single college credit to his name teach them history.
Sitting in his Mercury Radio Arts office three days later, Beck told me that he, too, noticed the silence and was astounded. ''If someone had told me, 'Hey, why don't you tell some history stories at the end, and there will be dead silence,' I'd have said, 'No way.' '' Beck has great distrust of success, especially his own. Friends say he is terrified of something going wrong, someone in his audience ''doing something stupid'' (presumably code for violence). There is a certain boyish disbelief in Beck as he engages in his real-time assessment, often on the air. ''I told my wife, 'I can't believe I actually have reporters following me to Alaska,' '' he said. (Note: reporter's wife said the same thing.)
Beck told me that he recently threw away all of his old tapes from his Morning Zoo years, so his kids could not hear them. He has no idea what his role is in the political firmament. The notion seems to bore him. His most animated attacks on Obama in the days after the ''Restoring Honor'' rally were over his take on the president's religious convictions, which Beck called ''a perversion of the Gospel of Jesus Christ as most Christians know it.''
He is fragile, on the edge. There is no template for him or for where he is headed. ''I have not prepared my whole life to be here,'' Beck told me from his plush couch, his face turning bright pink. ''I prepared my whole life to be in a back alley.'' I expected him to cry, but he did not.

HEADLINE: House Majority Still Uncertain, Republicans Say

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and CARL HULSE; Amanda Cox contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Republicans carry substantial advantages as they move into the final month of the fall campaign, but the resilience of vulnerable Democrats is complicating Republican efforts to lock down enough seats to capture the House and take control of the unsettled electoral battleground.
By now, Republicans had hoped to put away a first layer of Democrats and set their sights on a second tier of incumbents. But the fight for control of Congress is more fluid than it seemed at Labor Day, with Democrats mounting strong resistance in some parts of the country as they try to hold off a potential Republican wave in November.
The chances of a Republican takeover in the House remain far greater than in the Senate, according to a race-by-race analysis by The New York Times. But enough contests remain in flux that both parties head into the final four weeks of the campaign with the ability to change the dynamic before Election Day.
Races typically tighten in the final month as voters on both sides become more engaged, and the political climate is no more favorable for Democrats than it has been all year, with no substantial signs of improvement in the economy or the outlook for unemployment. 
Yet even as spending from outside groups is threatening to swamp many Democratic candidates, Republican strategists estimated that only half of the 39 seats they need to win control of the House were definitively in hand.
Many Democratic incumbents remain vulnerable, but their positions have stabilized in the last month as they have begun running negative advertisements to raise questions about their Republican challengers and shift the focus of voters away from contentious national issues like health care, bailouts and President Obama's performance.
For Republicans to take control of the Senate, the margin of error remains small. The party needs to win 10 of 12 of the most competitive contests, which include seats in Democratic-leaning California, Connecticut, Illinois and Washington.
Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the House Republican leader and the likely speaker if his party wins a majority, signaled that he wanted to step up the intensity. Before lawmakers left town to campaign last week, Mr. Boehner contributed $1 million from his fund-raising vehicles and pressed his colleagues into giving the party $3 million from their own campaigns to help pay for television commercials and make sure Republicans do not come up short because of a lack of resources.
''We have a lot of work to do,'' Mr. Boehner said in an interview.
Democrats pointed to positive signs in recent weeks, including that Senator Barbara Boxer, a third-term Democrat, appears to be running ahead of her Republican challenger, Carly Fiorina, in California. Mrs. Boxer's seat is among those Republicans have been working to capture.
In South Dakota, Representative Stephanie Herseth Sandlin, a Democrat viewed as being in deep trouble in her red state, has been running ahead in polls in what remains a competitive race.
''Our candidates are remaining viable long after the Republicans have counted them out,'' said Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. ''Voters are taking a very close look at the Republican challengers.''
But the field remains unusually unstable at this stage of the campaign, with early voting already under way in seven states and people in 17 more states eligible to begin casting ballots in the next two weeks.
Republicans pointed to signs of opportunity in House and Senate races. The National Republican Senatorial Committee plans to make a new investment of $2.2 million in the race for the West Virginia Senate seat that had been held for generations by Senator Robert C. Byrd, a Democrat who died this year. Gov. Joe Manchin III, a Democrat, had seemed to be in a strong position, but the race has suddenly become competitive.
Representative Gene Taylor, a conservative Mississippi Democrat who often breaks with his party and usually coasts to re-election, finds himself in a close race. In Illinois, Representative Phil Hare, a Democrat, is trying to hold off an energized challenger, while another Democrat, Representative Bruce Braley, is under attack in his eastern Iowa district. A conservative group based in Des Moines pledged last week to write a check for $800,000 to run television advertisements against Mr. Braley.
The Midwest, with its job losses and stagnant economy, is looming as particularly difficult terrain for Democrats, who have multiple tough races in Illinois, Michigan and Ohio.
But in other races across the country, Democratic candidates in some of the most difficult contests said that they were holding their own and that they were seeing a growing interest in the campaign among Democratic voters. While they say they have no illusions about the political environment, particularly as many remain below 50 percent in their own polling, they say they can still defy expectations and win with a strong voter turnout effort.
''Anyone who has written my campaign off is in for a surprise come election night,'' said Representative Earl Pomeroy, a Democratic incumbent battling for re-election in North Dakota.
Mr. Pomeroy has been rated one of the most vulnerable Democrats, given the Republican and conservative tilt of his state. But polls show him essentially tied with his Republican challenger, Rick Berg, who has been the subject of a series of tough attack ads from Mr. Pomeroy.
In Wisconsin, Senator Russ Feingold conceded that he was locked in a tough battle against a Republican newcomer, Ron Johnson. But Mr. Feingold scoffed at analysts who have all but placed him in the Democratic loss column in his bid for a fourth term.
''We think this is essentially tied, and we think we have a lot of horses to pull this out,'' Mr. Feingold said in an interview. ''This is going to be a very interesting month.''
He and other Democrats suggested that recent victories by Tea Party-backed Senate candidates like Christine O'Donnell in Delaware and Joe Miller in Alaska had caught the attention of some Democratic and independent voters, raising the prospect of a new crop of arch conservatives in Congress.
Senator John Cornyn of Texas, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said Democrats were delusional if they believed an upswing was under way.
''I'm sure they are looking for any glimmer of hope or opportunity,'' Mr. Cornyn said in an interview. ''I think things are pretty much locked in. The trajectory is pretty much fixed, and I don't think things are going to change much.''
Besides California, Democrats pointed to Delaware, Missouri and Washington as states where the party's prospects for holding the Senate seemed to be improving, though Missouri in particular is a difficult target. And in Illinois, Representative Mark Steven Kirk, the Republican candidate for the Senate seat once held by Mr. Obama, remained unable to separate himself from the Democrat, Alexi Giannoulias.
The size of the battleground, with as many as 15 competitive races in the Senate and more than 50 in the House, presented opportunities and challenges for both parties as they decided where to place their television advertising and other investments in the final stretch. But with outside Republican groups outspending Democrats by as much as 8 to 1, the vast landscape and the unexpected staying power of some vulnerable candidates presented particular obstacles for Democrats.
''While I enjoy the benefit of a larger playing field, it also brings tremendous challenges,'' said Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.

HEADLINE: Program Is to Foster Job Skills

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
As part of efforts to address record-high levels of long-term unemployment, President Obama plans to announce a new national public-private partnership on Monday to help retrain workers for jobs that are in demand. 
The national program is a response to frustrations from both workers and employers who complain that public retraining programs frequently do not provide students with employable skills. This new initiative is intended to help better align community college curriculums with the demands of local companies.
''The goal is to encourage community colleges and other training providers to work in close partnership with employers, to design a curriculum where they want to hire the people coming out of these programs right away,'' said Austan Goolsbee, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers.
Some similar employer-community college partnerships already exist around the country, generally in one-off programs. The new White House initiative, Skills for America's Future, will try to foster more of these programs, and to certify a list of best practices for public-private retraining partnerships.
The program will be run by the Aspen Institute, a not-for-profit, private research organization based in Washington, but will be accompanied by a new government task force with representatives from the Department of Labor, the Department of Commerce and other agencies.
So far five major private employers -- Gap Inc., Accenture, United Technologies, P.G.& E. and McDonald's -- have been named as partners, in part to build on existing training programs they already run.
''There's a number of studies and a number of discussions about the skills gap and how that's related to unemployment,'' said Penny Pritzker, a Chicago business executive and Obama fund-raiser who sits on the President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board. Her family foundation, the Pritzker Traubert Family Foundation, is providing $250,000 to the Aspen Institute to start the program.
''We're trying to bring together the government, the private sector, labor and community colleges and students to really address what is one of the structural problems facing this country right now,'' she said.
As yet there are no plans to request government money to support these efforts, White House officials said. Ms. Pritzker said she was working with other foundations to shore up financing.
The commitments from private partners are primarily in the form of providing guidance and scholarships to community colleges, not in donating funds directly to the new national program. P.G.& E., for example, says it plans to provide $1.5 million in in-kind support for each of the next three years to community colleges, including equipment donations and student field visits, according to Tamar Sarkissian, a P.G.& E. spokeswoman.
Mr. Obama is to unveil the new program in a meeting of the President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board on Monday, to be followed by a White House Summit on Community Colleges on Tuesday hosted by Jill Biden, the vice president's wife.
The Aspen Institute will announce an executive director for its new program on Oct. 25, according to Maureen Conway, executive director of the institute's economic opportunities program.

HEADLINE: A Protest March or an Invasion?

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ

 BODY:
POLITICIANS and journalists feared and mocked them. The police boosted their ranks by 200 to control them. Their leaders were hustled off to jail, on a charge that, 116 years later, seems not only anti-American but preposterous: unlawfully stepping on the grass outside the United States Capitol.
Such was life in 1894, at the first march on Washington. 
Jacob S. Coxey, an eccentric quarry owner from Massillon, Ohio, with a populist streak, led a scruffy band of down-and-out men and working-class radicals on a monthlong march from his hometown to the nation's capital during the economic depression of the 1890s. Coxey wanted Congress to put people to work building roads and public works projects with federally subsidized bonds. He called the march a ''petition in boots.'' The press dubbed them ''Coxey's Army,'' stirring fears of an invasion.
The notion that ordinary Americans could attempt to influence their government by simply showing up en masse was shocking to many in 1894. A federal law at the time prohibited speeches and the carrying of banners on Capitol grounds. Joseph R. Hawley, a Republican senator from Connecticut, warned his colleagues as Coxey's Army approached.
''It is quite possible to manage this business gently and firmly, and have it pass away,'' Hawley said, ''and it is quite possible to so manage it that it may become a habit to make pilgrimages annually to Congress, and endeavor to dominate Congress by the physical presence of the people.''
Every year, as the senator predicted, tens of thousands of people endeavor to dominate Congress by their sheer presence, marching and rallying for a multitude of causes. So far this year, the National Park Service has issued 647 permits for demonstrations in and around the National Mall, including one scheduled for this weekend. On Oct. 30, even the Comedy Central stars Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert are planning to host liberal rallies to make fun of conservative rallies. (The march as farce -- Mr. Colbert's is called the ''March to Keep Fear Alive'' -- is a rarity in Washington.)
Marching in 2010 and marching in 1894 are, of course, two different experiences.
On May 1, 1894, Coxey and somewhere between 500 and 1,000 marchers rambled along Pennsylvania Avenue toward the Capitol. Thousands lined the streets to watch. These days, the only people who watch for any length of time are reporters and cops.
And yet, Coxey's march foreshadowed many of the same logistical and tactical issues that today's protest organizers face. Even Coxey's message points to those of modern marches. One of the platforms of the rally in Washington on Saturday, which was sponsored by liberal groups, called for increased infrastructure spending to create jobs.
Newspapers covered virtually every step of Coxey's journey from Ohio to Washington. Mr. Coxey and his aides stressed their Christian roots, while reporters described them as tramps and cranks. Politicians and the press seemed to have one primary concern: How many will march? Organizers today continue to be frustrated that their larger message gets lost amid the focus on crowd size, and Coxey was perhaps the first march leader to use a wildly optimistic number -- he predicted 10,000 to 500,000 demonstrators -- to generate publicity.
There had been parades and small demonstrations in Washington before 1894, but Coxey's march was the first national protest pilgrimage to the capital, historians said, and it provided an early template for the many marches to come.
''It put it in people's heads that this was something that you might do,'' said Lucy G. Barber, author of ''Marching on Washington: The Forging of an American Political Tradition,'' ''that you might take your cause directly to Washington as an organization of the people, rather than as a lobbying group or as a delegation.''
Coxey made it up five steps of the Capitol before the police removed him as he tried in vain to read his prepared remarks. He spent 20 days in jail. Congress never acted on his proposals. On the 50th anniversary of his march, May 1, 1944, Coxey returned to the Capitol at the age of 90. Finally, he was allowed to give his speech.

HEADLINE: Mark Zuckerberg's Most Valuable Friend

BYLINE: By MIGUEL HELFT

 BODY:
PALO ALTO, Calif.
EVERY Monday a bit before 10 a.m., Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer, dashes off a quick e-mail to her boss, Mark Zuckerberg. ''We have a routine,'' Ms. Sandberg says. ''I e-mail, 'Coming in?' He replies, 'On my way.' ''
A few minutes later, Mr. Zuckerberg, Facebook's co-founder and chief executive, walks into the company's headquarters here, says a few hellos and heads to a conference room where he and Ms. Sandberg huddle for an hour. The two executives end the week the same way, with a closed-door meeting on Friday afternoon. They discuss products, strategy, deals, personnel -- and each other.
''We agreed that we would give each other feedback every Friday,'' Ms. Sandberg says. ''We are constantly flagging things. Nothing ever builds up.'' At a recent meeting, for instance, they ironed out a disagreement between them over the details of Mr. Zuckerberg's pledge to give $100 million to schools in Newark. 
If all of that sounds a bit touchy-feely, well, it is. Ms. Sandberg, a well-regarded Internet executive, is known for her interpersonal skills as much as for her sharp intellect. And her regular meetings with the famously introverted Mr. Zuckerberg have helped to keep one of Silicon Valley's most unusual business partnerships working wonders for Facebook.
Indeed, for a variety of reasons, Ms. Sandberg may well have become Mr. Zuckerberg's most valuable friend.
Since Ms. Sandberg joined the company more than two years ago, Facebook has successfully navigated one of the more perilous stages in a start-up's life: a period of hypergrowth. Facebook's work force has expanded sixfold, to nearly 1,800, and its global audience has multiplied by more than seven, to half a billion. Revenue, once little more than an afterthought, is expected to balloon to around $1.6 billion this year, according to estimates from Wedbush Securities. (Facebook, a private company, doesn't disclose its revenue.)
Part of the reason for that sales growth is Ms. Sandberg's close ties to many of the world's largest advertisers, relationships she first developed as a senior executive at Google. Ms. Sandberg also brought stability to Facebook, which had suffered from a long period of turmoil and the departure of several executives and early employees, including the company's other co-founders.
''One of the reasons the company is doing so well is because the two of them get along so well,'' says Mike Schroepfer, vice president for engineering.
Ms. Sandberg has focused on building the business, expanding internationally, cultivating relationships with large advertisers and putting her polish on things like communications and public policy. That has freed Mr. Zuckerberg to focus on what he likes best: the Facebook Web site and its platform.
Donald Graham, the chairman of the Washington Post Company, who once tried to hire Ms. Sandberg, says that in the last two years a lot of questions about Facebook's viability have been put to rest.
''The combination of Mark and Sheryl is the primary reason,'' says Mr. Graham, who is also a member of Facebook's board.
These days, Ms. Sandberg is also juggling another duty: mounting a defense of Mr. Zuckerberg at a time when a new movie, ''The Social Network,'' portrays him as an aloof and conniving student who may have stolen the idea for Facebook from others. Ms. Sandberg will have none of that.
''He is shy and introverted and he often does not seem very warm to people who don't know him, but he is warm,'' Ms. Sandberg says of Mr. Zuckerberg, her voice rising with empathy. ''He really cares about the people who work here.''
She can be just as protective of Mr. Zuckerberg in private.
At a technology conference this summer, for instance, Mr. Zuckerberg flopped during an onstage interview. He gave rambling answers to questions about Facebook's privacy policies, became visibly nervous and started sweating profusely. After the interview, Ms. Sandberg encouraged him not to beat himself up over it, but to focus on parts of the interview that went well so he could do better next time, according to people briefed on their interaction who didn't want to be identified because they were not authorized to discuss the matter.
''She really wants him to succeed,'' says one of these people.
For all her achievements, there's one area where Ms. Sandberg's influence has yet to work its magic: privacy concerns. While Ms. Sandberg is not ultimately responsible for the features on the Facebook site -- that's Mr. Zuckerberg's job -- she is deeply involved in the planning that revolves around them. She readily acknowledges that Facebook has made mistakes.
''It is completely fair to say that we have had our challenges around privacy,'' she says.
Ms. Sandberg says that Facebook built powerful privacy controls, but that they became too complicated for the average user. Facebook recently simplified those settings. ''Mark took the step to apologize,'' about the privacy problems, she notes.
But some critics say the privacy issue goes beyond how easily users understand Facebook's settings. For example, they note, Facebook collects increasing amounts of personal information from users to help marketers fine-tune their messages.
''I fear that Ms. Sandberg is failing to provide the adult supervision that Facebook requires,'' says Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, an advocacy group based in Washington. ''Facebook's direction regarding its use of its member data, and the viral and largely stealth marketing practices it endorses, is very disturbing.''
A spokesman for Facebook said the site lets users control what information they want to share and with whom, and makes it clear how the information may be used in its advertising products. Facebook never sells that information to third parties, the spokesman said.
MARK ZUCKERBERG and Sheryl Sandberg may well be Silicon Valley's oddest couple.
Mr. Zuckerberg, a 26-year-old engineer and product visionary, is socially awkward and reserved. At 41, Ms. Sandberg is the opposite: polished, personable, chatty and at ease in the limelight.
The differences don't end there. Mr. Zuckerberg dropped out of Harvard after his sophomore year to focus on building Facebook, and has never worked anywhere else. Ms. Sandberg, who has a Harvard M.B.A., is a veteran of Google, where she had a central role in building the largest, most successful advertising business on the Internet.
By the time she left Google, her unit had grown from a handful of people to about 4,000 employees, or about one-quarter of Google's total, and it accounted for more than half of the company's revenue. She also helped to establish Google's philanthropic arm and ran operations for a collection of unrelated projects, like Google's book-scanning operations.
Eric Schmidt, Google's chief executive, says he considers Ms. Sandberg to be a ''superstar.'' But there is growing tension between the two companies, in part because Ms. Sandberg has recruited a string of former Google executives and employees. About 200 ex-Googlers are now working at Facebook.
Before coming to Silicon Valley in 2001, Ms. Sandberg earned a degree in economics and then her M.B.A. from Harvard, did stints at the World Bank and at McKinsey & Company, and then worked as chief of staff for Lawrence H. Summers when he was Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration.
Despite their obvious differences -- or maybe because of them -- Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg have grown close. ''A lot of people choose to hire people who look exactly like them,'' Mr. Zuckerberg says. ''Here we just value balance a lot more. It takes work to build those relationships, but if it does work, you end up with a much better system.''
Mr. Zuckerberg met Ms. Sandberg at a Christmas party in 2007, and they immediately took a liking to each other. What followed was an intense, six-week business courtship, during which the two dined together multiple times a week. Because both of them are Silicon Valley celebrities, they typically ate at Ms. Sandberg's house so they could keep their talks confidential.
''We were very methodical and thoughtful about the relationship,'' says Ms. Sandberg.
For his part, Mr. Zuckerberg, ever the tech geek, describes their interactions as ''high-bandwidth.''
''We can talk for 30 seconds and have more meaning be exchanged than in a lot of meetings that I have for an hour,'' he says. Ms. Sandberg might give him a quick update on, say, the development of Facebook's offices in Ireland or India.
''I make sure that I understand the basic things that we are doing,'' says Mr. Zuckerberg. But, he adds, he trusts that anything Ms. Sandberg handles will run smoothly. ''The dynamic on the management team,'' he says, ''has improved a huge amount since she joined.''
Outside the company, Ms. Sandberg spends much of her time with advertisers. Last week, for example, she crisscrossed Manhattan, where she gave a keynote speech at an Advertising Week conference and met in private with various large advertisers.
Ms. Sandberg also oversees the seemingly arcane operational details that can help a company run smoothly -- especially a company that is growing rapidly.
She recently sat down with Pedram Keyani, an engineer whose team builds the tools that handle complaints and requests from Facebook's users. Mr. Keyani said Ms. Sandberg met with his small group to understand the challenges it faced, and later reorganized it to run more smoothly.
''She operates at every level,'' Mr. Keyani says. ''She's good at strategy and dives deep and understands how teams work together.''
THE embrace of Ms. Sandberg by Mr. Zuckerberg and Facebook's 20-something rank-and-file was not preordained. When she was hired, a frat-house atmosphere permeated the company, according to many early employees, and technology blogs speculated that she had been brought in to clean up the place.
To this day, Ms. Sandberg looks a bit out of place at Facebook. She sits in a cluster of desks that includes Mr. Zuckerberg's as well as those of other engineering and product executives. Their penchant for jeans, T-shirts and hoodies is in sharp contrast to her taste for elegant clothing. Her own staff, which handles most of Facebook's business functions, works in another building a few blocks away.
Her efforts to win over the Facebook troops began on her first day. She went desk to desk to introduce herself, cracking jokes and asking questions. It had the desired effect.
''She's legit,'' says Christopher Cox, a confidant of Mr. Zuckerberg and the company's vice president for product. ''She's not like a robot M.B.A. The people who get rejected here are the people who come here and say all these M.B.A. words like 'synergy.' ''
Ms. Sandberg earned a reputation for mentoring many younger employees -- especially women, encouraging many of them not to shy away from important roles simply because they were planning to start families. Ms. Sandberg can speak to that topic from experience: she is married to Dave Goldberg, the chief executive of SurveyMonkey, a maker of software for online surveys, and the couple have two young children.
Whenever anyone on her side of the company is promoted, she sends a congratulatory note.
People who have known Ms. Sandberg a long time say they are not surprised by her success. As a Harvard undergraduate, she sat near the back of an economics class taught by Mr. Summers. He says he didn't pay much attention to her until she turned in the best midterm examination in her class -- and then the best final.
Mr. Summers became her thesis adviser and later hired her to work with him at the World Bank and at the Treasury Department. Although she was still in her 20s, she played pivotal roles, like helping ramp up aid efforts to Africa by opening Treasury's door to Bono of U2.
''I had never heard of him and said to Sheryl that I only meet with people who have a first name and last name,'' Mr. Summers recalls. At Ms. Sandberg's urging, he finally agreed. Debt relief in Africa ''wouldn't have happened if she hadn't insisted I meet Bono and persevered on this issue,'' says Mr. Summers.
MS. SANDBERG'S connection with Mr. Zuckerberg runs especially deep. The two often socialize, and Mr. Zuckerberg, who was captain of his high school fencing team, has taught Ms. Sandberg's 5-year-old son a few fencing moves.
When Mr. Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan, his longtime girlfriend, started thinking about philanthropy, they turned to Ms. Sandberg. She immediately tapped her vast network of contacts and organized meetings with the likes of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York and Michelle A. Rhee, the schools chief in Washington, D.C.
Ms. Sandberg ''helped me navigate the politics of it and to figure out where I could have the most leverage,'' Mr. Zuckerberg says. ''That she was the person that Priscilla and I turned to is a strong symbol of our relationship.''

HEADLINE: Mr. Bloomberg, Mr. Murdoch, Mr. Colbert

 BODY:
It is too late to make a difference this year, but Congress, or at least one subcommittee, finally heard a thoughtful discussion about immigration. Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York and Rupert Murdoch, head of the News Corporation -- both billionaires -- told the immigration subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee that rational and well-regulated immigration is an economic necessity. 
Mr. Bloomberg told how New York City, rich in foreign-born, job-creating entrepreneurs, was riding out the bad economy far better than other parts of the country. He warned that America's refusal to fix its broken immigration system is a form of ''national suicide.''
Mr. Murdoch lamented that the world's best and brightest earn advanced degrees here and then go home, stymied by red tape and arbitrary visa quotas. He argued that giving illegal immigrants a path to citizenship would bring them ''out of a shadow economy and add to our tax base,'' and said ''it is nonsense to talk of expelling 11 or 12 million people.''
When Representative Maxine Waters asked where, on Mr. Murdoch's Fox News, it was possible to hear arguments like his, Mr. Murdoch said she could find them in The Wall Street Journal. That is a start.
A few days earlier, the same panel heard from the TV satirist Stephen Colbert, who told of his difficult day picking crops with migrant farm workers. His appearance, mostly played in character as a conservative blowhard, was a comedy routine wrapped around a heartfelt truth: that farm workers do a difficult and dangerous job that most Americans will not stoop to do.
We are not sure all committee members got it. We believe a lot more Americans would, if their elected leaders talked as bluntly and as persuasively as Mayor Bloomberg and Mr. Murdoch -- and with as much heart as Mr. Colbert.

HEADLINE: New Labour Leader Heads Back to Britain's Center

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS

 BODY:
LONDON -- Out of power for barely five months, Britain's Labour Party set an ambitious goal as it concluded its annual conference last week: fulfilling the pledge of Ed Miliband, the party's new, 40-year-old leader, an intellectual leftist strongly favored by Britain's powerful labor unions, to make the governing coalition of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats led by Prime Minister David Cameron ''a one-term government.''
On its face, the goal of an early Labour return to 10 Downing Street may not be an impossible reach, despite the deep popular disaffection for the party after 13 years in power and its crashing defeat in the May election. The Cameron government has committed itself, and Britain, to a huge gamble: that it can cut public spending brutally, at an average of 25 percent for most departments, and that the cuts will not only save an economy that remains at threat from one of the highest levels of government debt in Europe but also generate new economic momentum before the next election, most likely in May 2015. 
But there is another possibility, one Labour is betting on as its route back to power. In this version the cuts, the largest in Britain in a generation, will stifle Britain's stumbling climb out of recession, currently yielding an anemic growth rate not far above 1 percent. On this, Labour politicians like to quote President Obama. Reluctant to undertake budget cuts of his own before the American recovery gains pace, he has warned Britain and other European nations embarked on ambitious deficit-reduction plans that they risk plunging themselves, and much of the developed world, back into a double-dip recession.
But before Labour can hope to benefit from economic turmoil in Britain, the new leader will have to recast his own profile, as he emerged from the leadership battle, and convince Britain's voters that he is more than a callow ''old-style North London lefty,'' as he was described in a commentary in the right-wing Daily Mail.
Mr. Miliband was tagged ''Red Ed'' by Britain's right-wing tabloids after a leadership campaign that was nakedly pitched for labor union support, including harsh criticism of the Cameron budget cuts. That stand yielded him victory when union votes gave him the smallest of margins to squeeze past his older brother, David Miliband, the former foreign minister and longtime front-runner for the position. David Miliband quickly bowed out of frontline politics, saying he wanted to end the ''soap opera'' the fraternal rivalry had become.
During the Labour conference, the older Miliband, who is 45, was joined in the defection to the parliamentary backbenches by other heavy-hitters from the reformist ''New Labour'' movement that carried the party to three successive election victories after 1997 under Tony Blair. They included Alistair Darling, Jack Straw and Bob Ainsworth, three of Labour's highest-ranking ministers in the troubled government of Gordon Brown, who resigned as Labour's leader after the May defeat. Also gone, with them, was much of the party's experience, leaving some critics to portray the ''new'' party of 2010 as sorely lacking in political heft.
After his victory, Mr. Miliband seemed at haste to reposition himself toward the center ground where British elections are won. On the economy, he seemed to rebuke left-wingers who acclaimed his victory as having ''buried'' New Labour, made a pariah of Mr. Blair and set the party back on a path to its traditionalist, class-warfare, union-bound roots.
One of these, Neil Kinnock, whose term as Labour's leader ended after two defeats by the Conservatives, in 1987 and 1992, said that with Mr. Miliband's defeat of his brother, ''We've got our party back.'' Another Brown-era cabinet member, Hazel Blears, described the New Labour years as ''wicked and malicious.''
Not so, Mr. Miliband seemed to be saying, as he outlined approaches to budget cuts and strikes much closer to Mr. Cameron's position -- and his brother David's -- than anything he said in the leadership race. ''There will be cuts and there would have been if we had been in government,'' he said.
As for the unions, which have been threatening strikes on a scale Britain has not seen since Margaret Thatcher came to power more than 30 years ago, he had a warning, drawn from Labour's wilderness years before 1997. ''We need to win the public to our cause, and what we must avoid at all costs is alienating them and adding to the book of historic union failures,'' he said. ''That is why I have no truck, and you should have no truck, with overblown rhetoric about waves of irresponsible strikes.''
But Mr. Miliband appears keen to reap whatever profit he can from the coming storm for the coalition government, which will detail its austerity program in Parliament on Oct. 20. Without suggesting how Labour would have made the budget cuts, he described the government's plans as irresponsible and unfair, bearing hardest on those with ''middle and low incomes.'' And he invoked Labour's glory years after 1945, when Clement Attlee's government, although saddled with Britain's wartime debt, began building Britain's welfare state. ''That generation cut the deficit, but they had a bigger vision: for a new economy and a good society,'' Mr. Miliband said.
The admonition echoed the grumblings increasingly being heard from disaffected Liberal Democrats, junior partners in the Cameron government, many of whom would have preferred a coalition with Labour after the May election. Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister and Liberal Democrats' leader, is already facing a nascent party revolt over the cuts, even before they have begun to inflict widespread pain across the country. Whether he can keep his followers in line for the full five years the coalition has said it plans to govern is a big question, but no bigger, in its way, than the task facing Mr. Miliband.
An unscripted moment at the Labour conference underscored how difficult it might be to unite the party's reformist and traditionalist wings. After Ed Miliband repudiated Mr. Blair's decision to take Britain to war in Iraq, David Miliband, who voted for the war in Parliament and stood by it as foreign minister, sat stony-faced. Beside him, Labour's deputy leader, Harriet Harman, once a New Labour stalwart, applauded vigorously. Television cameras picked up their exchange.
''Why are you clapping? You voted for it,'' Mr. Miliband said, meaning the war.
''I am clapping because, as you know, I'm supporting him,'' Ms. Harman replied, referring to the new leader.

HEADLINE: Growing Anti-Immigrant Sentiments in an Unlikely State

BYLINE: By A. G. SULZBERGER

 BODY:
CRETE, Neb. -- Nebraska may appear to be an unlikely setting for swelling anti-immigrant sentiment.
This agricultural hub is far removed from any border. It has long been more preoccupied with bolstering its population than keeping people out. And immigrants, legal and otherwise, have been fixtures for years in the fields and meatpacking plants here, helping this state put meat and vegetables on dinner tables around the country.
But even as the state enjoys relative economic health -- unemployment, at 4.6 percent, is the third lowest in the nation -- illegal immigration has taken a more central and more divisive place in the politics of communities like this one, visibly transformed by an influx of immigrant newcomers. 
That shift in political dialogue has been propelled here by Gov. Dave Heineman -- even before it was a national issue. Four years ago, Mr. Heineman, a Republican, made his unyielding opposition to illegal immigration a central part of his underdog campaign for governor.
Now, as a popular incumbent heavily favored to win, he recently announced that one of the first acts of his second term would be to press for a law that would make it easier for local police officials to arrest illegal immigrants, which he said would be closely modeled on the controversial law adopted in Arizona that is now being challenged by the Obama administration in court.
''I'm very adamant about this -- the federal government has failed to solve the immigration issue,'' Mr. Heineman said in a recent interview in his offices in Lincoln, where the shelves are stocked with college football paraphernalia and the ceilings and walls are adorned with murals celebrating cultures from around the world. ''Next January I believe in every state in America there will be an Arizona-type law introduced.''
In an election cycle defined by concerns over jobs and mortgages, government spending and debt, the issue of illegal immigration has become a common talking point on the campaign trail.
Candidates running for office in a dozen states have pledged to introduce legislation similar to the Arizona law, according to a count by the Immigration Reform Law Institute, which supports the passage of such laws. But while some of those efforts are given slim chances of passing, such a law is favored by a large majority of Nebraskans.
This summer, Fremont, where Mr. Heineman got his start on the City Council, barred businesses from hiring illegal immigrants and landlords from renting to them -- a contentious battle that unnerved Hispanic residents across the state.
Residents here say that Crete, a city of 6,000 that is dominated by the meatpacking plant looming over downtown, does not share the conflicts that have affected other communities with growing Hispanic populations. Still, there is a palpable unease when talking about immigration.
''We're just getting too many Hispanic people in town,'' said Gerry Boller, 78, who works at the counter at New Beginnings Thrift Store on Main Avenue. ''It seems like they come in and take over.''
At Super Latina, a grocery store next door, Jose Banos, the 36-year-old owner, said that when he moved here from El Salvador 15 years ago, there were no stores that catered to the Hispanic community. Now his is one of many.
But immigrants are worried by the situation in Fremont and the talk of replicating the Arizona laws, and some are talking about leaving.
''Arizona needs the law more than we do because on the border, problems with immigrants come with other problems, like guns and drugs,'' Mr. Banos said. ''Here in Nebraska, it's a whole different story. Immigrants in Nebraska are coming for work.''
Just over a decade ago the state's two most prominent Republican elected officials -- Chuck Hagel, then a senator, and Mike Johanns, a governor who is now in the Senate -- banded together to successfully pressure federal authorities not to create a program aimed at cracking down on the hiring of illegal immigrants in the state's meatpacking plants.
Since that time the number of foreign-born residents -- the majority of whom are Hispanic -- has increased drastically, more than 40 percent since 2000, according to census estimates. The number of illegal immigrants grew more than 50 percent in that time to 45,000, according to estimates by the Pew Hispanic Center, a nonpartisan research group in Washington.
But even if concern about these new arrivals simmered across the state, it did not become a central part of the political dialogue until 2005, when Mr. Heineman was elevated from lieutenant governor to the top post after Mr. Johanns resigned to be United States agriculture secretary.
Mr. Heineman's tenure was expected to be short. The next year, in the Republican primary, he faced the University of Nebraska's much-beloved football coach turned congressman, Tom Osborne. But Mr. Heineman proved a more deft campaigner and lavished attention on the issue of illegal immigration.
''It was the defining issue of his campaign,'' said David J. Kramer, a lawyer and former state Republican chairman who also ran for office that year. ''It was the issue that made the difference between him winning and losing.''
As governor, Mr. Heineman has emphasized that the state welcomes immigrants, as long as they are legal. He has battled repeatedly, though so far unsuccessfully, to rescind in-state college tuition rates for children who grew up in the state but are in the country illegally.
He put in effect a system to perform mandatory checks of those applying for government benefits to ensure that they are not illegal immigrants. And, more recently, he upset some of his anti-abortion supporters by ending a program that provided prenatal care for pregnant women who are in the country illegally.
But while Mr. Heineman's previous efforts addressed circumstances that affected dozens if not hundreds of illegal immigrants, an Arizona-style law would be far more sweeping.
Mike Meister, a Democrat who is running against Mr. Heineman, has strongly opposed the proposal, which he said was ''clearly unconstitutional'' and would waste money by forcing the state to fight an inevitable lawsuit. Mr. Meister, a lawyer who is trailing badly in the polls, accused Mr. Heineman of using the proposal as a wedge issue.
''He is pandering to the least common denominator,'' Mr. Meister said. ''Our fear of difference.''

To get to the owner's seats at the Texas Rangers' stadium, a retro redbrick bandbox that looks utterly out of place on the suburban plains of Dallas, you have to pass through a small room beneath the stands that George W. Bush, who participated in the design and construction of the stadium in the early 1990s, envisioned as a bunker for his father, then president of the United States. But the younger Bush divested himself of his interest in the Rangers before the Ballpark at Arlington was completed, and the concrete bunker now serves as a V.I.P. lounge.
When I met one of the team's new owners, Nolan Ryan, there midway through a home game against the Minnesota Twins one night in August, he was munching on melon and refilling a cup of iced tea. Ryan led me to his box behind the Rangers' on-deck circle and introduced me to his wife, Ruth, who has known Ryan since he was a Little League pitcher in Alvin, Tex. 
During his major-league career, Ryan kept himself lean and taut. At 63, he has relaxed into the more generously proportioned body of an ex-athlete, with an ample gut, a broad chest and massive, rounded shoulders. Earlier in the day, when I spoke with Ryan in his office, he was wearing a dress shirt and tie; he tugged roughly and repeatedly at his collar, vainly trying to give his thick neck a little extra room to breathe.
He seemed much more comfortable now, settling into his seat in a red Rangers polo shirt. As a pitcher, Ryan was not known for his economy -- he holds the major-league record for walks in addition to strikeouts -- but as a baseball analyst, he doesn't waste words. He spoke in a low voice with a Texas twang, dispassionately labeling pitches and their locations as a taxonomist would (''cutter, middle-in'').
Ryan purchased the Rangers this past summer, putting an end to one of the more feckless ownership stints in the history of the game. As a business story, the tale of the franchise under Tom Hicks, who bought the Rangers from Bush and his partners in 1998, is a familiar one: billionaire private-equity manager with no sense of his own limitations moves aggressively into an industry that he knows nothing about, leverages his new company to the hilt and goes belly up. As a sports story, the Rangers under Tom Hicks were a case study in everything that traditionalists will tell you is wrong with Major League Baseball. For most of his 12-year tenure, the franchise more or less gave up on cultivating its own talent, instead paying exorbitant salaries to free agents, many of whom (Alex Rodriguez, Rafael Palmeiro and Ken Caminiti, among them) would later be exposed as steroid users. They played ugly, mediocre baseball, protracted offensive battles that ended with football-like scores. ''We came in here every night thinking we were going to outslug our opponents,'' Ryan said. ''We'd be up 12-7, and when we walked out of here after a four-hour game, we were beat 15-12.''
Ryan has presided over the team's baseball operations for the last three years. Thanks in large part to his guidance, the club is headed to the postseason for the first time in more than a decade, hoping to end its ignominious reign as the only existing major-league team never to have won a playoff series.
The Rangers now play a starkly different kind of baseball, one oriented around the old-fashioned virtues of pitching and defense. The game Ryan and I watched was a pitchers' duel, punctuated by some memorable plays in the field, including a courageous one-out throw to the plate by the Rangers' rookie first baseman, Mitch Moreland, who gave up the easy out at first base to prevent what would have been the Twins' go-ahead run in the top of the seventh inning.
The Rangers pulled ahead by one run in the bottom half of the inning, and in the ninth brought in their 22-year-old closer, Neftali Feliz, to preserve the lead. The scouting report on Feliz -- overpowering fastball but dubious control of his off-speed pitches -- invites comparisons to a young Ryan. Feliz made it interesting -- ''that's him learning his trade,'' Ryan said of one pitch that was pounded to the warning track -- but eventually closed things out. The Rangers won, 4-3.
If the game served as a reminder of how far the lowly franchise has come, the sparse crowd of 20,000 was an indicator of how far Ryan and his ownership group have to go in order to turn their new asset into a good investment. This is not the first time that Ryan has tried to rescue the team. When he joined the Rangers as a 42-year-old free agent for the 1989 season, they were coming off a second-to-last-place finish. Ryan breathed some new life into the franchise but never managed to lead them to the playoffs. What he is seeking to do now as an owner of the team will be considerably more difficult: he wants to transform the Rangers into a baseball anomaly -- a profitable, consistently competitive club in a medium-size market.
Not only will the Rangers be competing with much richer teams; they'll be competing with an inhospitable climate. In the summer, it's routinely 100 degrees and oppressively humid in Arlington, a serious deterrent to anyone contemplating an evening at the ballpark. While the fall may bring cooler temperatures, it also brings the start of football season. The Rangers play in the shadow of the Dallas Cowboys, who sell out $27.50 tours of their new behemoth of a stadium -- when there's no game going on -- and have a virtual monopoly over local corporate sponsorship dollars.
When I asked Ryan about the Cowboys, ''America's Team,'' the crusty baseball lifer shifted, briefly and incongruously, from his native tongue to one he's still struggling to master, the language of the boardroom. ''Those guys next door dominate the market,'' he said. ''We'll never be the Cowboys -- we understand that. But there's room for a lot of growth here. There's an awful lot of upside.''
TOM HICKS WAS one of the richest men in Texas when he acquired the Rangers. A leveraged-buyout specialist who made his fortune turning around struggling companies, he had grand, costly ambitions for the team that included converting 75-plus acres of land surrounding the stadium into a sprawling mixed-use development called Glorypark. Hicks famously signed Alex Rodriguez in 2000 to a 10-year, $252 million deal -- at least $50 million more than the next highest bidder -- and offered lavish contracts to many less notable free agents, skirting Major League Baseball's debt-load rules by borrowing cash not for the Rangers but for their parent company, Hicks Sports Group.
Rodriguez couldn't carry the team himself, and most of his supporting cast disappointed. The Rangers struggled; revenues dwindled. Hicks, a habitual consolidator and would-be sports mogul, had already merged the operations of the Rangers and his hockey team, the Dallas Stars, which further alienated fans. ''You had people calling up for tickets, and they may be talking to somebody from Canada who never played baseball, doesn't know a thing about baseball and probably doesn't care much about baseball,'' Ryan said.
By 2004, Hicks was so desperate to shed expenses that he agreed to continue paying one-third of Rodriguez's annual salary for another six years if the Yankees would take him off his hands. Four years later, Hicks announced that he couldn't secure financing for Glorypark and was shelving the project.
It was around this time, shortly before the 2008 season, that Hicks hired Ryan as president. In his retirement, Ryan, a churchgoing model of physical fitness, had moved seamlessly from pitcher to pitchman, for everything from Advil to the National Rifle Association to Whataburger (not to mention his own company, Nolan Ryan's All-Natural Beef). Most people around baseball assumed that his new job with the Rangers would involve more of the same: basically adding some badly needed luster to the team's ailing brand. Instead Ryan immersed himself in the team's baseball operations, trying to figure out what went wrong and how he could fix it.
Baseball clubs, like all institutions, develop cultures that are reflected in the types of people they employ. In Texas, hitters -- preferably power hitters -- have always been the priority. ''When I got here as a free agent in 1989, that's already how it was,'' Ryan told me. ''We already had Juan Gonzalez, Sammy Sosa and Ruben Sierra. And what do we do? Go out and trade for Rafael Palmeiro and Julio Franco.'' The team's stadium, which opened in 1994, was designed to favor hitters, with easily reachable fences and an office building in centerfield to block potentially problematic headwinds.
Between the enervating summer heat and the E.R.A.-inflating ballpark, Texas became a team of last resort for free-agent pitchers. For those who were already part of the organization, regular thrashings were assumed. Ryan sought to change this by finding and developing more talented pitchers, and also by addressing what he considered the root cause of the problem: the cycle of low expectations, insufficient confidence and poor performance. ''People came into our organization thinking you couldn't pitch here, and that's just wrong,'' he said. ''We had to get them in the right frame of mind and believing in themselves.''
Days before the opening of the 2009 season, Hicks stopped paying interest on the Rangers' $525 million in debt and put the team on the market. (Hicks has made a similar hash of another of his sports investments, Liverpool, England's most decorated soccer team.) By this point, Ryan was already starting to feel a sense of ownership over the franchise. After sitting in on numerous presentations to potential buyers during the early months of the 2009 season, he decided to lead his own group to purchase the team.
AS IMPROBABLE AS the notion of an ex-ballplayer buying a major-league team may sound, it's important to keep in mind how much Nolan Ryan, whose likeness seems to stare down at you from every corner of the Arlington ballpark, means to the Texas Rangers. The 12-foot-tall bronze statue of him in the centerfield plaza may say as much about the franchise's history of futility as it does about Ryan -- after all, he played just 5 of his 27 seasons with the Rangers and took the ball only every fourth or fifth day at that -- but it's almost impossible to exaggerate Ryan's celebrity in Texas. He was born and raised there, and between his three cattle ranches, his stance on the Second Amendment and his reputation for gritty toughness and quiet rectitude, he embodies many of the state's favorite ideals. He has his own highway, the Nolan Ryan Expressway, and if you spend even a little time in Texas you're likely to meet a disproportionate number of boys named either Nolan or Ryan. So enamored was Bush of his team's former ace that he took a detour in 1999 from his presidential campaign to attend Ryan's induction into the Hall of Fame.
Ryan partnered with Chuck Greenberg, a sports lawyer in Pittsburgh who owns a pair of class-A baseball franchises. They rounded up 18 mostly local investors, including two prominent energy titans, Bob Simpson and Ray Davis, and named their new company the Rangers Baseball Express, a play on Ryan's nickname, the Ryan Express (itself a play on ''Von Ryan's Express,'' a World War II movie starring Frank Sinatra that came out around the time of Ryan's big-league debut in 1966).
Their purchase of the franchise dragged on for months and was nearly derailed by angry creditors, who balked at the initial agreement last fall, arguing that Hicks and Major League Baseball were conspiring to sell the Rangers to their hometown hero at a hometown discount. In May 2010, after months of legal wrangling, Ryan and Greenberg's group tried to push the deal through in the form of a prepackaged bankruptcy plan, but a judge ordered a competitive auction. A new group led by the billionaire Mark Cuban, who owns the Dallas Mavericks, entered the bidding. ''Once Cuban came in,'' Ryan said, ''I didn't think we'd get it done.''
The purchase price ultimately rose beyond what Cuban felt the franchise was worth, and the Rangers Baseball Express won out. Its $593 million bid for the team was accepted on Aug. 4. As fate would have it, this was the anniversary of the most iconic moment in the franchise's history, which took place in the otherwise-unremarkable season of 1993. Not surprisingly, Nolan Ryan was at its center: then 46 and in the final season of his long career, he drilled Robin Ventura of the Chicago White Sox with a pitch. Ventura, who was 20 years his junior, charged the mound. Ryan put him in a headlock and proceeded to punch away at his head and face.
WHEN I MET Greenberg in his office at the ballpark one afternoon in late August, he navigated his way through a thicket of congratulatory gift baskets and Champagne bottles and fished out a large framed photograph. It was a picture of Ryan and Ventura during their famous fight, a photo that can be found just about any place that sells baseball memorabilia. (For a little extra money, you can get one autographed by Ryan.) Only it had been slightly doctored: the back of the uniform of the player Ryan was pummeling didn't read ''Ventura.'' It read ''Cuban.''
Greenberg told me that he first met Ryan in the spring of 2009, when another potential buyer brought him to Texas to look at the Rangers. In certain respects, he is the perfect partner for Ryan. In 1999, he engineered Mario Lemieux's purchase of the Pittsburgh Penguins, a deal unmistakably similar to Ryan's acquisition of the Rangers. (Former star saves bankrupt team.) Moreover, as a minor-league owner, Greenberg knew something about marketing irrelevant franchises.
Greenberg, all cheerful confidence and exuberant restlessness, gave me his well-honed stump speech on the Rangers' untapped potential: ''It's the perfect alignment of the stars. A team that's up and coming on the field whose fan base is not exactly spoiled by an overabundance of postseason success in a large and dynamic community that loves its sports but had been turned off by so many things about this franchise.''
Market size, the preferred method for evaluating the economic prospects of sports franchises, is a mushy metric, contingent on too many variables, like where you draw your geographic boundaries, the strength of the local economy and the competition for fan and sponsorship dollars. The Rangers seem to fall somewhere between a large-market team whose financial model depends on big TV contracts, reliable ticket sales and lucrative sponsorship deals, and a small-market one that relies on the league's mandatory revenue-sharing to supplement the income provided by its more modest fan base.
Greenberg is trying to approach the Rangers with a small-town, minor-league touch, while at the same time inflating the franchise's ambitions to those of a big-market team. As Ryan sits in the owner's box, a security guard keeping autograph seekers at bay, Greenberg, who is 49, roams the ballpark, introducing himself to fans and posing for pictures -- the owner as mascot.
Putting a retractable roof over the stadium, another of Hicks's unrealistic ambitions, would cost about $300 million, a prohibitively high price for new owners who already paid more than they intended for the club. In the absence of air-conditioning, Greenberg has cut prices and introduced ''blue-light specials'' during certain innings, trading profit margins for goodwill. ''I hope they're buying full-priced sodas or beers to wash them down,'' he told me at the ballpark one night, after seeing fans swarm to the concession stands for $1 hot dogs.
Greenberg's model is Arte Moreno, the owner of one of the Rangers' division rivals, the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. Moreno bought the Angels from the Walt Disney Company in 2003 and built them into one of baseball's most valuable franchises. He, too, mingled with fans and slashed prices, but his real stroke of genius was rebranding the team as the Los Angeles Angels -- under Disney, they were the Anaheim Angels -- and expanding their marketing reach from the narrow confines of Orange County to Los Angeles.
There are some critical differences between the Angels and the Rangers, though. The Angels play in a recently renovated stadium and a baseball-friendly climate in the country's second-largest media market. What's more, they won the World Series in 2002 and have pretty much dominated their division ever since. That is, until the Rangers' rise this year.
EVEN WHEN THE Rangers have gotten off to a strong start, they have typically wilted during the second half of the season. But a few weeks ago, they swept three games from the defending World Series champions, the New York Yankees, erasing any doubts about how formidable an opponent they could be in the playoffs.
How did baseball's bankrupt team become one of its best? The Rangers' success this year can be traced back to a rebuilding born of economic necessity in 2007, one year before Ryan's arrival in Texas. The team had just finished another year under .500. Hicks was no longer able -- or willing, anyway -- to spend profligately on the free-agent market, and the minor-league system was pretty much devoid of worthy prospects. ''We began to realize that we really need a long-term sustainable plan here,'' Jon Daniels, the team's 32-year-old G.M., told me in Texas. ''It's just not realistic for us year in and year out to compete with New York, Boston, Chicago, L.A., etc., on the free-agent market.''
The Cornell-educated Daniels, who gave up Little League for fantasy baseball before starting high school, was named general manager of the Rangers in 2006, supplanting the Red Sox's Theo Epstein as the youngest G.M. in the history of the game. He is largely responsible for restocking the organization's depleted farm system and shifting its focus from buying to developing talent. Midway through the 2007 season, Daniels dealt Mark Teixeira to the Atlanta Braves for a handful of prospects. At the time, plenty of fans were furious about losing the team's star, but two of the players the Rangers acquired -- Feliz and Elvis Andrus -- are part of the nucleus of this year's team. Before the 2007 season, the Rangers' minor-league system was near the bottom of Baseball America's annual rankings. Before the 2010 season, it was near the top.
The effects of the Rangers' rebuilding started to become apparent last year, when they competed for a playoff spot into September. With their owner in default, though, they had limited means to improve during the off-season. Major League Baseball had to approve the team's budget, and operating expenses were covered by loans from a central fund that all major-league teams are required to pay into. ''We were just in survival mode,'' Ryan said.
Rather than trying to sign a high-priced free agent to plug a hole in their starting rotation, the Rangers offered a two-year, $5 million contract to Colby Lewis, who spent the previous two seasons pitching for the Hiroshima Carp after being released by the Kansas City Royals. Lewis has revived his career in Texas, becoming the rare pitcher to successfully transition from Japan to the United States.
Redemption is a theme that runs throughout the 2010 Texas Rangers. During spring training, the team's manager, Ron Washington, nearly lost his job after Sports Illustrated reported that he tested positive for cocaine. The engine of their offense is 29-year-old Josh Hamilton, another once highly regarded prospect who struggled for years with a crack addiction and was out of baseball almost entirely from 2004 to 2006.
The Rangers may never be the Cowboys, but they have already transformed themselves into what you might call a modern version of America's Team, a franchise fresh from bankruptcy, led on the field by a former big-league washout, two reformed drug abusers -- and a mercenary ace, Cliff Lee, who joined the Rangers, his fourth team in two years, in July. The Lee acquisition was a symbolic gesture, an effort to energize Rangers fans in the face of the uncertainty surrounding the team's bankruptcy proceedings. But it was also a practical move meant to improve the team's chances for postseason success. ''We're trying to do something we've never done before -- win,'' Daniels says.
The way it works -- notionally, anyway -- is that most owners promote and support their teams and defer to their general manager, manager and coaches, the paid experts, on matters of sport. It seems fair to say that Ryan, like the Cowboys' owner Jerry Jones, is going to be uncharacteristically active in his team's baseball affairs, especially when it comes to acquiring and developing pitchers.
In our conversations, Ryan lamented the fate of the modern pitcher, who has had to contend not only with performance-enhanced hitters but with certain changes to the rules of the game. During his playing days, Ryan relied heavily on intimidation; he is particularly annoyed by the empowering of umpires to eject pitchers from games for throwing at batters. ''You take an aggressiveness out of the pitchers and put it into the hitters,'' he told me in his office, where a pair of large oil paintings of cowboys on the Texas frontier hang above his desk.
Initially drafted in 1965 by the Mets, Ryan won his only World Series ring with New York but still couldn't wait to leave. After a stint with the Angels, he became a free agent in 1979 and promptly returned home to Texas, pitching nine years in Houston before finishing out his career with the Rangers.
Ryan retired as one of the greatest pitchers ever, but the subsequent ascendance of statistical analysis in baseball has not been especially kind to his legend: the growing appreciation for walks as an offensive weapon has knocked him down more than a few pegs in the pitching pantheon. What remains remarkable about Ryan, though, is not simply his longevity -- even in his 40s, his fastball approached 100 miles an hour -- but his durability. At age 42, he once threw 166 pitches in a single game.
Ryan was never known as a student of the art of pitching. He was a power pitcher, blessed with an absurdly strong, seemingly indestructible arm. But he now has firmly held convictions about how to handle pitchers, and they stand in direct opposition to baseball's prevailing orthodoxy -- what he calls ''the babying'' of modern-day pitchers. ''Pitch counts drive me nuts,'' Ryan said. ''You gonna put Steve Carlton or Tom Seaver or Bob Gibson on a pitch limit?''
Ryan is now trying to fashion the Rangers' pitcher corps in his own image, pushing them to increase their workloads and stay on the mound deeper into games. There is hard science to suggest that pitchers increase their risk of injury after throwing a certain number of pitches -- the common benchmark is 100 -- but Ryan argues that other factors should be considered, like the fluidity of a pitcher's mechanics on a given day, which can significantly alter how much stress he's putting on his arm.
Above all, Ryan is convinced that pitchers can be built to last longer, even in the Texas heat. To strengthen his arm, Ryan used to throw 45 minutes of batting practice a day in spring training; even after pitching a no-hitter, he could be found on an exercise bike in the Rangers clubhouse. Since his return to Texas, Ryan has overseen the introduction of a similarly rigorous training program for pitchers: extra wind sprints, more long tossing (playing catch at a distance of as much as 300 feet) and plenty of live batting practice. ''You have to get them in shape and get them to know they're in shape,'' he said. ''Then they start believing they can throw more pitches.''
For now, Ryan's approach seems to be working. Not long before I got to Texas, the Rangers played a day game against the Red Sox. Despite the 102-degree heat, the Rangers starter, C. J. Wilson, managed to stay on the mound until the eighth inning, throwing a total of 113 pitches. The Rangers won, 7-3.
When I talked to Wilson beside his locker in the Rangers' clubhouse one afternoon, he told me that he'd been training for his home starts by jogging in a sweatshirt whenever the team was playing in a city where the temperature was below 90. A 29-year-old left-hander from Southern California, Wilson signed with the Rangers in 2001 -- ''back when the identity of the team was big basher dudes with huge contracts,'' he said -- and failed miserably when he made his debut as a starter in the big leagues in 2005. He was soon demoted to the bullpen. Before the 2009 season, Wilson sought out Ryan to ask how he could get another shot at starting. Ryan told him that he needed to be more efficient with his pitches, learn to use both sides of the plate and wean himself from his dependence on his fastball. The two spoke frequently over the course of the year as Wilson dedicated himself to following Ryan's directions. Last spring, he was rewarded with a spot in the Rangers' 2010 rotation. He has since become one of the best pitchers in the American League.
THE RANGERS HAVE a lot riding on this postseason. Their sales staff's ability to move more season-ticket and luxury-suite packages for 2011, the key to raising ballpark revenues, will depend in large part on whether the team can end its long history of letting down its fans.
Looking a bit further ahead, the Rangers will pose an interesting test for Major League Baseball's class system. Ryan doesn't aspire to follow the Florida Marlins, contending for a pennant every five years or so before losing the young talent they've cultivated to better-capitalized teams. He envisions the Rangers as the St. Louis Cardinals, a reliably good team in a midsize market with an ardent, loyal fan base.
The 2010 Rangers are young, talented and vastly underpaid. In the coming years, a number of the team's best players will be costly to retain, and the Rangers' financial flexibility is likely to be limited. Ryan told me that the team's modest $68 million payroll will be going up, but it's hard to know how much given that the new owners are obligated to pay about $200 million in debt, nearly half of which is deferred compensation to players like Rodriguez who have long since left the team. What's more, the Rangers had to plunder their minor-league system to get Lee -- who will himself almost certainly be pitching somewhere else next season.
As misguided as Hicks's stewardship of the team may have been, as a businessman he understood that professional sports are a form of theater. Jerry Jones, the Cowboys' owner, recognizes this, too. He has maintained his franchise's dominance of the local sports market by signing stars and building the modern colossus -- in the middle of a recession, no less -- that looms so menacingly over the Rangers old-fashioned bandbox.
Ryan is hoping that being consistently competitive, a high bar for a franchise of the Rangers' limited means and uninspiring past, will be enough. ''My goal as an organization is to come out every spring with a realistic shot at winning our division, and if people believe that, then they're going to be supportive of you,'' Ryan said. ''But, you know, if you do like some organizations -- the Cubs are really stinking up the place, and so is Houston and Pittsburgh -- well, that's a hard sell.''

To the Editor:
''Can We Build in a Brighter Shade of Green?'' (Sept. 26) offered a very realistic discussion of the issues of green home construction. We encountered some of these challenges in 2007-9, as we built our 1,900-square-foot, passive solar home on a remote site in Montana. We were able to use American manufacturers for all of our materials, including our 190 square feet of triple glazed, coated, south-facing windows with the right solar heat gain properties. 
If we are to have more truly energy-efficient houses, we need more architects, builders and others to embrace the principles and techniques. And it takes determined owners, like those in the article, to drive a project through a seemingly more complicated and higher-cost path to completion.
Bill and Julie Madden
Gig Harbor, Wash., Sept. 27
To the Editor:
As a building contractor in New England, I was suitably impressed by your description of the latest in green home-building technology. But then I got to the price tag of the home that was featured in the article: perhaps more than $550,000 for a 2,000-square-foot house.
I live in a 160-year-old, drafty wood-frame house that costs roughly $1,000 to heat each winter. Not counting inflation, I will be spending $50,000 over the next 50 years to stay warm, assuming that I live that long.
But as for paying more than a half-million dollars today for that kind of savings, how many Americans can afford to be so green?
And, when it comes to energy, what is the carbon footprint to manufacture all the components of this green house and transport them to the site? Jay Harris

Among the cases examined by Ms. Ellerbee, center above, are those of Carl Walker Hoover, who hanged himself at age 11 after becoming the target of gay slurs, and Jon Carmichael, who hanged himself at 13 after being picked on because of his short stature. Other participants include Emma, a 17-year-old from South Hadley, Mass., where, in 2010, Phoebe Prince, a 15-year-old transfer student from Ireland, committed suicide after being relentlessly taunted about her sexual history. And then there is Maria, 13, who was suspended for harassing a classmate and has since been part of an anti-bullying program in Atlanta. The program helps girls ''feel better about themselves,'' Maria says. ''I think it helped me a lot.'' She sighs. ''I wish I hadn't bullied that girl.''

HEADLINE: Jordana Horn, Jon Gordon

BYLINE: By ROSALIE R. RADOMSKY

 BODY:
Jordana Horn and Jon Andrew Gordon are to be married Sunday morning at Congregation B'nai Jeshurun in New York. Rabbi Michael S. Friedman is to perform the ceremony, with Rabbi Azriel C. Fellner taking part.
The bride, 37, will continue to use her name professionally. She is the New York correspondent for The Jerusalem Post. She graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, and received a diploma in world politics from the London School of Economics. She also earned a law degree at the University of Pennsylvania.
She is a daughter of Susan Horn and Dr. Matthew Horn of Short Hills, N.J. 
The bridegroom, 49, is a partner in Palladian Capital Partners in New York, an investment firm, where he focuses on private companies. He graduated magna cum laude from Harvard, from which he also received an M.B.A.
He is a son of Dr. Sidney L. Gordon of Great Neck, N.Y., and the late Gilda H. Gordon.
The bride's previous marriage ended in divorce, as did the bridegroom's.
The couple were introduced through JDate in November 2009, when Ms. Horn, a freelance journalist at the time and mother of two young boys, asked Mr. Gordon if he would join her for a screening on the Upper West Side that was part of the Other Israel Film Festival.
Ms. Horn, who had been out on dozens of dates with men she had met on the site, had spotted his photo. She thought that he was cute and that his profile showed a great flair for grammar and language.
So she exchanged e-mails with him, not disclosing her true intent: she had been working on a proposal for an editor at The Forward. She wanted to become the dating columnist for the Jewish weekly, and planned to write an article about her date with Mr. Gordon as part of her pitch.
Mr. Gordon, who had gone out with 20 to 30 women he had met on the site over a couple of years, was clueless about being Ms. Horn's first subject. He had already fallen for her sense of humor from her profile, especially the part he recalled in which she described herself as ''everything that you ever dreamed of -- if what you dreamed of was a short curvy Jewess with a razor wit.''
He said, ''I knew I had to meet her,'' and the fact that her profile indicated that she was the mother of two small children did not bother him in the least. He hadn't dated anyone with children before, and was intrigued. So he took Ms. Horn up on her offer as long as she agreed to join him for dinner first, which she agreed to.
At that dinner, at an Upper West Side restaurant, they said that time seemed to speed by.
''He looked at his watch and said we should get going,'' recalled Ms. Horn, who told him, ''I'm having a great time, forget the movie.''
''I did a quick mental calculation,'' she said. ''I would rather meet someone truly terrific than have a column about dating misadventures.''
So she replaced the prospect of doing a dating column with the possibility of romance, and was not disappointed. (She later revealed her initial plan, and he professed to have been flattered that she gave up the idea of a column for him.)
By February 2010, Ms. Horn knew they were getting serious, and decided to put their romance into perspective.
''Everything existed in this love-happy bubble,'' she said, and she was most concerned about meeting ''someone not only right for me, but for my two boys.''
So, in all seriousness she reminded him that her children were her priorities.
''I know you're into me,'' she said, ''but I come with baggage.''
With his comeback -- ''Well, now that I've met them, I can say they are the Louis Vuitton of baggage'' -- she realized she had truly met her match. ROSALIE R. RADOMSKY

HEADLINE: House Music, Bred in Chicago, Comes Out

BYLINE: By IDALMY CARRERA

 BODY:
Chicago, which is widely considered the birthplace of house music 30 years ago, is again exerting its influence, as the semi-underground genre enjoys its coming-out party.
House, with its pulsating, percussion-laden beat, was born in the late 1970s as a way to refashion unpopular disco tracks into music with a fresh appeal. Frankie Knuckles, a pioneering D.J. at the former Warehouse nightclub in the South Loop, and other D.J.'s, beefed up percussion and bass, and sped up the tempo to make it danceable. Elements of gospel, blues and soul were added to give the music more meaning.
''There's a traditional Chicago sound,'' said Willy Joy, a D.J. and producer. ''Chicago house and ghetto house was 'hood music, and still is.'' 
But, he added, the genre has evolved.
''It's a little harder-edged, and it's been modernized,'' he said. ''It's the same way you could say R&B from the '70s doesn't sound like R&B from today. It's still R&B, but due to a million different things, the sound evolves.''
For three decades, house and other electronic genres lived primarily in the late-night culture of Warehouse and similar out-of-the-way nightclubs, attracting a postdisco audience that skewed heavily gay. But for the first time, the music has moved more into the mainstream. Pop bands like The Black Eyed Peas have adopted elements of house. And house artists at big music festivals like Chicago's annual Lollapalooza and the North Coast Music Festival last month are drawing big, diverse crowds dancing -- known as jacking -- in unison.
''Dance culture started to evolve from this petri dish that was the club, and the people that were playing other people's music were also writing their own music, and some of these D.J.'s were slipping in their own tracks, and that's how the dance culture has evolved -- where now the attention is really on the D.J.,'' said Perry Farrell, creator of the Lollapalooza festival, which more than doubled its budget for its dance area in Grant Park over the summer.
Industry observers say house's recent crossover appeal may partly be a result of the sour economy.
''With the recent economic downturn, people are just trying to have fun again,'' said Erik Bradley, music director at pop-music radio station WBBM-FM 96.3. ''I think that's really what it's about. They're looking for uplifting and positive instead of negative and down.''
No matter the reason, the Chicago house sound has caught the ears of mainstream pop artists, who are sampling house tracks within their own music. The Black Eyed Peas' most recent album, ''The E.N.D.,'' borrows heavily from house and other electronic influences, helping give the group its most successful album commercially.
''Boom Boom Pow,'' the first single released, sampled a house track, ''Be,'' and sat at No. 1 on the United States Billboard Hot 100 chart for 12 weeks. The group's ''I Gotta Feeling,'' produced by David Guetta, a French house D.J., also claimed the top spot on the chart.
''A lot of other artists have picked up some of the flavor of dance music and incorporated some of the best that it has to offer into their music. It's both helped them and helped us because it's making the sound become more popular,'' said Charles Matlock, a D.J. and professor at Columbia College Chicago, who in consultation with Mr. Knuckles is writing the curriculum for ''History of House Music,'' a course he will teach at the college next fall.
Organizers said the inaugural North Coast Music Festival, held in Union Park in September, drew more than 45,000 fans to a three-day bill that included jam bands and hip-hop acts, staples of summer festivals, but which was noticeably stacked with D.J.'s and other electronic acts.
Of 62 performers, 38 put on D.J. sets. Among them was Curtis Jones, a Chicago native and house artist who performed as Green Velvet, but recorded his first hit ''Coffee Pot (It's Time for the Percolator),'' as Cajmere in 1992. Mr. Jones said he was ''pleasantly surprised'' by the turnout during his performance at the festival.
In another sign that house has gained momentum, Mr. Farrell is planning for more growth at Lollapalooza.
''Every year we grow it; every year we invest more money into it, more time,'' Mr. Farrell said. ''The names that we bring in get bigger and bigger, and the scene itself grows.''
Mr. Matlock said, ''It used to be that if you wanted to listen to house and you wanted to dance, you had to go to clubs.''
Now, he said, the pendulum is swinging in the other direction.

HEADLINE: Booming Car Sales in China May Bypass Diesels

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY

 BODY:
PARIS
China's fast-developing auto market may skip diesel cars altogether and move directly to gasoline-electric hybrid vehicles, BMW's head of sales and marketing said Friday in an interview at the Paris Motor Show. 
Because Beijing limits sales of diesel fuel to trucks, Chinese consumers, unlike Europeans, have never gotten used to the idea that diesel is more economical than gasoline, said Ian Robertson, who is also a member of the German company's management board.
The proximity of the market to leading East Asian hybrid makers also suggests such an evolution, he said.
BMW has made a goal of being the top luxury carmaker in China. Its sales there are running ahead of schedule, and the company, which had already raised its 2010 forecast from 100,000 vehicles to 120,000 vehicles, is certain to surpass even the higher estimate, Mr. Robertson said.
BMW, based in Munich, sold more than 90,000 cars there last year.
''China is already our third-largest market, displacing the U.K.,'' he said. Growth in Britain will be up ''about 22 percent'' this year, he added, while sales in China had been up as much as 100 percent in some months.
BMW's brands also include Mini and Rolls-Royce.
Germany is the company's largest market, he said, having overtaken the American market during the financial crisis, but added ''it's nip-and-tuck with the United States.''
BMW is hoping the new version of its X3 luxury crossover, which it rolled out at the auto show, will again make the United States its top market. The company invested $750 million in its Spartanburg, S.C., facility to produce the vehicle.
Mr. Robertson noted that despite the weakness of volume automakers in mature markets, the global luxury sector was holding up well. ''It's not just cars,'' he said, ''it's true for handbags and hotels, too.''
BMW's overall sales are up 12.5 percent for the year through August, to 920,000 vehicles, he said.
While the German market fell by roughly a quarter during that time, much of that decline resulted from the end of government ''cash for clunker'' programs, which simply drew demand forward, he said. But as those programs were meant to help consumers move to smaller cars, they did not help the premium market to begin with, and it wasn't adversely affected by the expiration of the incentives, he said.
''Our European sales are basically flat,'' he said.
BMW later Friday announced a recall of 350,800 BMW and Rolls-Royce cars worldwide to fix a problem with the power brakes. The company also this week announced a ''major order'' from Saab to provide the automaker with 4-cylinder gasoline engines.

HEADLINE: Tax Cuts and Incentives

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''What the Rich Don't Need'' (Economic View, Sept. 26), Richard H. Thaler marshals familiar arguments against extending a tax cut for upper-income Americans. But the column doesn't address a key issue. 
The weakness of the current economic recovery can be attributed in part to the administration's handling of bank capitalization issues and its manifest hostility to business -- particularly in the financial and health care industries. As a result, the recovery has been suppressed by uncertainty and fear about the future. Huge amounts of money in banks, on corporate books and in the hands of investors are not being applied, so there can be no robust recovery.
If the administration succeeds in its objectives, the factors generating stagnation will be reinforced. But if tax cuts are extended across the board for several years, all Americans are likely to be better off as perceptions and incentives improve for those who control the formation and application of capital in our economy.

HEADLINE: College Advice I Wish I'd Received

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Ditch Your Laptop, Dump Your Boyfriend'' (Op-Ed, Sept. 26):
Four years ago I was a freshman in college, and I lapped up this sort of advice: Branch out, do everything and anything, go all out.
But within my first month of college, I had pulled my fifth all-nighter and had a scratched cornea from keeping my contacts in too long. I was coxing for the crew team and writing editorials for the newspaper. I stayed up with my dorm mates in the laundry room discussing J. S. Mill and what so-and-so did last night when he was drunk. But I was burnt out. 
So here's some more cautious advice that I wish someone had told me four years ago: Don't spread yourself too thin, but find one or two activities that you truly love and stick with them. Make new friends, but don't let go of those best friends from high school because friends, old and new, are all precious.
Study hard and study what you love because our economy today needs bright minds. And finally, sleep when you need to, because a scratched cornea is no fun.
Sarah Lee Busan, South Korea, Sept. 27, 2010
The writer, a 2010 graduate of Williams College, is in South Korea on a Fulbright.
To the Editor:
None of the writers contributing to the Op-Ed collection offering advice to college freshmen mentioned the difficulty involved when paid work is necessary during college. I advise that you segment your large assignments so you don't find yourself in the precarious position of having to stay up all night to complete them, and in turn fall behind in other areas.
Incorporate exercise into your daily routine, and if possible take one day off a week from school and work. The quality of your schoolwork and paid work will benefit from taking good care of yourself.
On a final note, if the pressure to stay solvent becomes overwhelming, remember that learning is a lifelong process. There are artificial time lines created in academia, and there is no such thing as permanent failure. After my freshman year I had a 1.5 grade point average, and by the time I graduated (eight years later) I was hovering around a 3.0. Just as in the tabloids, academia loves a good comeback story.
Melanie Carlson Athens, Ga., Sept. 28, 2010
The writer is a master of social work student at the University of Georgia.
To the Editor:
While I appreciate the lighthearted tone of the contributors to ''Ditch Your Laptop, Dump Your Boyfriend,'' I felt that one serious piece of advice to freshmen was missing: to consider whether they should be in college in the first place.
In five years as an adjunct instructor and a graduate student, I have seen a lot of students who came to college for the wrong reasons. Some were pressured by parents, others by high school guidance counselors, and some come just because it seems to be what everyone else is doing. The reality is that college is not for everyone, and many freshmen who start this year will not graduate.
Students, and those who are part of their support system, should be aware of and carefully consider the alternatives that are out there. Community colleges offer affordable tuition and often smaller class sizes for those who need more instructor attention. Vocational and technical programs prepare students for a variety of careers where a B.A. or a B.S. is not needed.
A ''gap year'' program can help students narrow their interests and make extra money, helping them to get through degree programs faster and with less debt if they ultimately decide college is for them.
In a world where tuition continues to rise and graduates face a high debt load and a poor economy, too few are aware of the alternatives available to them. Additionally, for those first-years who do decide to go the noble path of the four-year degree, there is one more piece of advice I would add: Buy a style guide, and learn how to use it. Your teaching assistant will thank you.
Alexis Leanna Henshaw Tucson, Sept. 26, 2010
The writer is a Ph.D. candidate in political science at the University of Arizona.
To the Editor:
I was reading the advice to ''ditch your laptop'' while sitting in my media studies lecture. In a class where we learn about the meanings and effects of media, I was consuming media that told me to stop reading it and pay attention.
The levels of irony here are too complex for me to decipher, but regardless, the purpose was served. I logged off and redirected my attention toward my professor. The Times lost a reader, at least for an hour, but my teacher gained a listener.

HEADLINE: Las Vegas Faces Its Deepest Slide Since the 1940s

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

 BODY:
LAS VEGAS -- There are many cities across the country that are beginning to see the first glimpses of the end of the recession.
This is not one of them.
The nation's gambling capital is staggering under a confluence of economic forces that has sent Las Vegas into what officials describe as its deepest economic rut since casinos first began rising in the desert here in the 1940s.
Even as city leaders remain hopeful that gambling revenues will rebound with the nation's economy, experts project that it will not be enough to make up for an even deeper realignment that has taken place in the course of this recession: the collapse of the construction industry, which was the other economic pillar of the city and the state.
Unemployment in Nevada is now 14.4 percent, the highest in the nation and a stark contrast to the 3.8 percent unemployment rate here just 10 years ago; in Las Vegas, it is 14.7 percent. 
August was the 44th consecutive month in which Nevada led the nation in housing foreclosures.
The Plaza Hotel and Casino, which is downtown, recently announced that it was laying off 400 workers and closing its hotel and parts of its casino for eventual renovation, the latest high-profile hit to a city that has seen a steady parade of them.
''It's been in bad shape before, but not this bad,'' said David G. Schwartz, director of the Center for Gaming Research at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. ''If you look at the gaming revenues, they have declined and continue to decline over the past three years. ''
''Sept. 11 set off a two-year slowdown,'' Mr. Schwartz said. ''But nothing of this magnitude.''
Mayor Oscar B. Goodman said in a recent interview that he was ''very bullish on our future,'' offering as evidence the packed airplanes he encountered both ways on a recent trip east to appear on ''The Colbert Report.''
But, he added: ''Our daily room rate average is not what it was. Our hotel room rates are bargains now. People aren't spending on gambling as they have in the past. Ordinarily Las Vegas was the last to go into a recession and the first to come out. This one is different. As soon as they feel secure in their financial position, then Las Vegas will come back stronger than ever.''
The drop in the city's gambling revenues, at first glance, tracks historical trends: Americans cut back on recreational travel and gambling during a recession. There are some signs that gambling revenues, which are down to 2004 levels, have at least stabilized. After months of precipitous decline, revenues increased 3 percent in the first quarter of 2010, but then dropped 5 percent in the second quarter, according to the Center for Gaming Research.
''I think we are bumping along the bottom,'' said Stephen P. A. Brown, the director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, which has been tracking the downturn. ''Expectations are that once the U.S. economy turns around, the gaming industry will begin to improve.''
What is worrisome now is the nature of this economic downturn, when many people saw the value of their retirement funds or homes collapse. Economists say people are less likely to gamble as freely as they have in the past, particularly baby boomers, who may now be rattled about their retirement years. In one sign of this, while there were more people coming to Las Vegas in recent months, gambling receipts have remained stagnant.
''The big players, the ones who gamble the big money, I'm not sure they have it anymore,'' Mr. Goodman said.
Gambling by Nevadans -- itself a steady and critical stream of revenue -- has also fallen off as a result of high unemployment, and analysts see no obvious way to turn that around anytime soon.
''Although gaming dropped with this economy, don't automatically assume that when the economy comes back people will start gaming at the same level,'' said Keith Foley, a senior vice president at Moody's Investors Service who tracks the industry. ''We put this in the grand scheme of things. This is a highly discretionary form of spending. People lost their savings.''
And in the midst of all of this, standing as a prime symbol of Las Vegas's taste for extravagant risk -- or perhaps of a fateful misreading of a changing landscape -- is a huge new ''urban community'' called CityCenter, which opened next to the Bellagio on the Strip.
Built by MGM Resorts and the government of Dubai, CityCenter is the largest privately financed construction project in United States history. It is an $8.5 billion labyrinth of hotels, casinos, retail malls, meeting rooms, auditoriums and spas spread across 76 acres with 16 million square feet of floor space. Steel and glass, a crush of buildings often rising at discordant angles, it is an arresting display of a new style of architecture and urban planning that has not been seen in Las Vegas before.
CityCenter was conceived before the economic downturn and did not open until last December, an unfortunate turn of timing that dropped 5,000 new hotel rooms into the city when some of the older properties had been struggling to bring people in. Another 2,500 rooms are due to be added when another new hotel and casino on the Strip, the Cosmopolitan, opens in mid-December. (A recent check online found rooms being offered for as little as $38 a night at the Sahara Hotel and Casino.)
At the same time, officials here are watching another potentially disruptive storm on the horizon: legislation in Congress that would legalize Internet gambling. Mr. Brown said he was hopeful that online gambling would not draw people away from Las Vegas because ''Internet gambling appeals more to addicted gamblers than people who are seeking a casino experience.''
But Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Senate majority leader who is in the middle of a bruising re-election fight, said he would oppose such a move because it would hurt the state's tourism industry and cost jobs.
And Billy Vassiliadis, the chief executive of the advertising agency that represents the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, said, ''People are looking at mall visits and online shopping and saying, 'Yeah, that could be a problem.' ''
''Am I worried?'' Mr. Vassiliadis continued. ''Hey, listen, I wish we could go all the way back to before Atlantic City opened. By my nature, I like monopolies as long as they are my clients.''
The potential challenge from the Internet is a reminder of just how much the playing field has changed for Las Vegas over the past generation: with states sponsoring weekly lotteries and legalized gambling permitted in many cities and Indian reservations.
In what may be no better sign of this city's concern, Mr. Vassiliadis said officials were thinking of tweaking its iconic advertising slogan ''What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas'' to better appeal to a country that may not be in a big-spending, ''let's party'' state of mind.
The downturn in gambling is just one big part of the economic malaise. Nevada is paying a price for an exuberant and often speculative run of commercial and residential construction that has left the market glutted. As a result, the confidence that the return of tourists alone would spur the city to rebound automatically after this recession -- the way it did after, say, the recessions of 1982 and 1991 -- is absent.
''There was a time 25 years ago that if tourism rebounded, the state rebounded,'' Mr. Vassiliadis said. ''That isn't the case anymore. The other side of the economy here is going to be harder. There needs to be some real, thoughtful, deliberate effort to rebuild an economy here. It isn't going to happen by itself.''

CORRECTION-DATE: October 10, 2010

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about the economic travails of Las Vegas because of the recession misstated the year that an earlier recession ended. Economic data showed that the recession ended in March 1991, not 1992 (though it was still a major issue in the 1992 presidential race.)

 BODY:
THE NEWS President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia ousted Moscow's longtime mayor, who had tried in recent weeks to cast Mr. Medvedev as a weakling unfit to run the Kremlin. 
BEHIND THE NEWS Mr. Medvedev's decision to sack Yuri M. Luzhkov seemed intended to show that he was an assertive leader and viable candidate for president in 2012. (Vladimir V. Putin, the former president and current prime minister, has refused to say whether he will run for his old job.) An alternative view held that Mr. Medvedev had taken too long to dismiss Mr. Luzhkov.
THE NEWS Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff, resigned to run for mayor of Chicago, his hometown.
BEHIND THE NEWS Mr. Emanuel has been an outsized presence in the White House since President Obama's first days. But he made no secret of his ambition to be mayor of Chicago; now he has his shot, as Richard M. Daley, the ''mayor for life,'' prepares to retire. Mr. Emanuel will be replaced by Pete Rouse, a senior adviser who has been at the president's side since Mr. Obama arrived in Washington nearly six years ago as a senator.
THE NEWS The final scene of the Metropolitan Opera's new production of ''Das Rheingold'' fizzled on opening night when the bridge to Valhalla failed to appear for the exit by the gods, including Bryn Terfel as Wotan.
BEHIND THE NEWS The mechanical glitch blemished an otherwise successful debut for the production, the first installment of a new ''Ring'' cycle, directed by Robert Lepage with James Levine conducting. ''We try new things. Sometimes not everything works as well as we would like,'' said Peter Gelb, the Met's general manager.
THE NEWS The heads of the New York Philharmonic and Washington National Opera announced that they would step down from their posts.
BEHIND THE NEWSZarin Mehta will depart the Philharmonic at the end of the 2011-12 season, after 12 years. And Placido Domingo, the busy tenor, conductor and opera impresario, will leave his job as general director of the Washington National Opera in June after 15 seasons. Both depart as the recession has put enormous pressure on those institutions and forced them to rethink their roles in American society.
THE NEWS Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki of Iraq appeared almost assured of a second term after winning the support of an anti-American Shiite Islamic movement led by Moktada al-Sadr.
BEHIND THE NEWS Mr. Maliki's renomination to the post he has held since 2006 was a breakthrough after nearly seven months of back-room bargaining that has followed the country's elections on March 7. But the return to political influence of Mr. Sadr's followers, who once battled American troops, would be a setback for the United States.

HEADLINE: Ethnic Wins In Bosnia May Cause Deeper Splits

BYLINE: By DAN BILEFSKY; Joanna Kakissis contributed reporting from Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina.

 BODY:
PRAGUE -- Fifteen years after the ethnic war in Bosnia ended, an outspoken nationalist Bosnian Serb leader was expected to triumph in elections there on Sunday, reinforcing ethnic divisions and threatening to rip apart the fragile country, according to political leaders and analysts.
The United States-brokered 1995 Dayton accord, which divided the country of Bosnia and Herzegovina into two entities -- a Muslim-Croat Federation and a Serbian Republic -- ended a war in which more than 100,000 people were killed, a majority of them Muslims. But the byzantine political system that emerged has magnified ethnic enmities. 
With Bosnia's economy struggling and its prospects for European Union and NATO membership appearing increasingly remote, the country is in need of national unity. But analysts say that collective economic hardship has failed to unite voters across the ethnic divide in parliamentary and presidential elections. They say the vote threatened to entrench the political deadlock that has impeded progress toward greater integration with Europe.
Sead Numanovic, editor of Dnevni Avaz, a Bosnian newspaper, said stasis and separatism were eroding the resolve of even moderate Bosnians. ''We face the threat of secession; our economy is in recession; poverty is everywhere; corruption is rampant,'' he said. ''Bosnians are feeling humiliated as our country's very existence is in question.''
Underlining the challenge to the country's future, analysts said, is the growing popularity of Milorad Dodik, the Bosnian Serb prime minister, a strong-willed former basketball player who has repeatedly called for the Serbian Republic to secede. He appears likely to be elected president of the Serbian Republic.
Mr. Dodik has argued that Bosnia's breakup is all but inevitable. He recently told Reuters that he was convinced that the Serbian Republic ''will become independent within the next four years.'' .
He said, ''It is our political right to decide on our status.''
His intransigence has been echoed by his longtime political rival Haris Silajdzic, the Muslim who is hoping to retain his spot on Bosnia's three-seat presidency, held by a Muslim, a Croat and a Serb. He has argued that the Serbian Republic's very existence has legitimized genocide.
But in a sign that moderation could prevail among Bosnian Muslims, the Central Election Commission said late Sunday that early returns from nearly 74 percent of polling stations showed Bakir Izetbegovic leading the race for the presidency's Muslim seat. He campaigned for dialogue among Bosnia's ethnic groups and is viewed as far more conciliatory than Mr. Silajdzic.
Zeljko Komsic, from the multiethnic Social Democrats, looked poised to win the Croat slot of the presidency.
It is a sign of how simmering tensions remain, however, that rival ethnic groups are still arguing over the facts surrounding the massacre of more than 8,000 Muslim men and boys at Srebrenica during the Bosnian war in 1995, for which wartime Bosnian Serb leaders have been indicted on genocide charges at the war crimes tribunal in The Hague.
In April, Mr. Dodik questioned the official number of Muslims killed at Srebrenica, citing research showing that several hundred listed as missing or dead were still alive. Bosnian Muslims objected that he was seeking to rewrite history.
Analysts say that Bosnian leaders from all sides will need to confront the country's economic challenges. Bosnia's economy shrank by 3.4 percent last year, according to the International Monetary Fund, which extended a rescue package worth about $1.6 billion to Bosnia in 2009. Unemployment was about 43 percent in July.
Beyond the economic challenges, some observers say that the world is turning its back on Bosnia. Its security is guaranteed by 2,000 European Union peacekeepers. But Western diplomats say European countries have been clamoring for at least a partial withdrawal. They say the United States, distracted by wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, no longer considers Bosnia a priority.
Anita Kapo, a 22-year-old design student voting Sunday, said Bosnia was so paralyzed by nationalism that voting seemed futile. Her family escaped to Germany during the war. ''I keep trying and trying and trying to be positive about Bosnia,'' she said. ''But nothing ever changes.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: This Is a Big Year For Small Advisers

BYLINE: By JEFFREY GOLDFARB and ROBERT CYRAN

 BODY:
Independent merger advisers should relish their moment in the sun. The busiest among them have grabbed a record share of the American market this year.
Big banking supermarkets suffered distractions and defections as midsize deals and independent advice have become all the rage. That has helped send business to the crop of firms, including start-up boutiques, that are small enough to fail. The phenomenon may, however, be short-lived.
A decade ago, the 16 nonsupermarket institutions in the top 25 mergers and acquisition advisory firms had only about 6 percent of the business, according to data from Thomson Reuters. By 2008, their share had crept up to 10 percent. 
This year, the group, which includes established advisory companies like Greenhill & Company and newcomers like Moelis & Company, have taken in 20 percent of the business.
Nine of the top 10 deals involving a takeover of an American company have included at least one of these focused advisory firms. They say it's all about independence from the big institutions that suffered losses in the recent crisis and subsequent government scrutiny.
The crisis has helped boutiques and their ilk in other ways, too. One-stop shops have been restrained from opening their balance sheets, which used to be a competitive advantage.
Big fee-generating buyouts dried up, providing more opportunities for smaller firms to compete for business. And senior bankers from big firms have either hung out their own shingles or landed at boutiques, bringing customers with them.
These trends won't last, though. There will continue to be room for differentiated and specialized advice, like the kind dispensed in Silicon Valley by Frank Quattrone's Qatalyst Partners or by Byron Trott, the former Goldman banker focused on family companies, who struck out on his own and advised Alberto Culver on its sale to Unilever last week.
But when the economy picks up again, deals will grow in size and big banks will again use their checkbooks to win deals. Many bankers now at small firms will find that their relationships with clients' chief executives had at least as much to do with their former deep-pocketed employers as it did with their own charm. Independent advisers should gorge while they can.
Salesforce Soaring
Salesforce.com's stock valuation is reaching the clouds. The company, which provides customer services software, straddles the technology industry's new holy trinity: social networking, cloud computing and mobile services. But just as buzzwords can be overwrought, so can company valuations. Salesforce could be a case in point.
Software that helps companies find and keep customers may sound rather dull, but Salesforce's Internet-based subscription service has several advantages. Customers can, for example, share servers so they don't each have to buy and maintain machines. The model also potentially makes it possible for users to reach the service anywhere while on the go.
Salesforce's numbers have been on a tear. Revenue increased about 30 percent a year during the last two years. And the company's newest product, Chatter -- an application that's a bit like a cross between Twitter and Facebook for businesses -- promises further growth.
That needs to happen. Use the company's preferred tweaks to its earnings, and it is valued at 95 times estimated earnings for this year. But add back standard expenses like option grants, and the price-to-earnings ratio increases to 255 times. Salesforce may be a great business, but that's a huge valuation. The broader stock market trades at around 14 times estimated earnings for 2010.
Suppose Salesforce can expand faster than the average company for 10 years before falling in line. Even so, to justify today's valuation premium to the broader market, its earnings would have to grow 34 percentage points a year faster than the average company's during that decade. That's a tall order.
True, selling software online generates lots of cash. That's why at 40 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a proxy for operating cash flow, Salesforce's valuation looks slightly less lofty than on an earnings basis. But that's still almost five times the Ebitda multiple attached to Apple.
Perhaps the simplest signal that the stock might be overpriced is the actions of its founder and chief executive, Marc Benioff. In September, on average, he unloaded more than $1 million of stock every trading day in preplanned sales. He still has a boatload of stock, and it would take more than four years to sell it at this rate. But with Salesforce shares trading in the stratosphere, it's a shadow investors should keep their eyes on.

HEADLINE: Health Care's Lost Weekend

BYLINE: By PETER ORSZAG. 
Peter Orszag, the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget from 2009 to 2010 and a distinguished visiting fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, is a contributing columnist for The Times.

 BODY:
Doctors, like most people, don't love to work weekends, and they probably don't enjoy being evaluated against their peers. But their industry can no longer afford to protect them from the inevitable. Imagine a drugstore open only five days a week, or a television network that didn't measure its ratings. Improving the quality of health care and reducing its cost will require that doctors make many changes -- but working weekends and consenting to quality management are two clear ones.
That's why an effort at New York University Langone Medical Center to institute both of these changes is so important. If it succeeds, it will help point the way to the health care system of the future. 
First, weekends. It's never good to be hospitalized, but you really don't want to be hospitalized on a weekend. There are fewer doctors around, and people admitted on Saturdays and Sundays fare relatively poorly.
One study in 2007 found, for example, that for every 1,000 patients suffering heart attacks who were admitted to a hospital on a weekend, there were 9 to 10 more deaths than in a comparable group of patients admitted on a weekday. The weekend patients were less likely to quickly receive the invasive procedures they needed -- like coronary artery bypass grafts or cardiac catheterization.
It's not just a safety issue but, for less life-threatening medical problems, also a matter of convenience. Wouldn't it be nice to be able to schedule your elective surgery on a Saturday if you wanted? Most hospitals don't offer that option.
And then there are the economics of a $750 billion-a-year industry letting its capacity sit idle a quarter or more of the time. If hospitals were in constant use, costs would fall as expensive assets like operating rooms and imaging equipment were used more fully. And if the workflow at existing hospitals was spread more evenly over the entire week, patients could more often enjoy the privacy of single-bed rooms.
N.Y.U.'s first step toward seven-day service has been to keep certain functions going all weekend, like radiology study interpretation, magnetic resonance imaging and elective cardiac surgery. The cancer center also now provides some treatments on weekends. And some procedures, like elective Caesarean sections, are offered on Saturdays. So far, the doctors involved are on board.
A second innovation is quality assessment and management. As the saying goes, if you can't measure it, you can't manage it -- or improve it. That's why the federal government is now making key investments to encourage hospitals, clinics and doctors to adopt health information technology and report statistics on quality of care.
Robert Grossman, the dean and chief executive of N.Y.U. Langone, has gathered data from around the medical center into a ''management dashboard.'' This allows him to monitor not only financial information like operating margins and cash balances but also detailed quality data on individual doctors like 30-day hospital readmission rates and the number of infections associated with invasive procedures.
The patterns he has been able to discern this way have been eye-opening. The dashboard data revealed, for instance, that on any given day a disproportionately small number of eligible patients were discharged before noon, so that many people were kept in the hospital longer than necessary. Further analysis revealed a key reason: several routine procedures that some patients need before leaving, like the insertion of central catheters, were not performed in the morning. The medical center has since begun to offer the procedures earlier, and the percentage of discharges before noon has increased significantly.
So far, so good. But will these initiatives become a permanent part of the culture? And if the strategies do survive, how much difference can they make in the cost and quality of care?
N.Y.U. has historically not stacked up that well in cost comparisons with other hospitals. The Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care, which tracks data on regional variations in Medicare costs, suggested that from 2001 to 2005 a Medicare beneficiary's care at N.Y.U. during the final two years of his life cost taxpayers more than $100,000 -- roughly twice the cost at America's most efficient hospitals.
The Dartmouth data also indicate that the N.Y.U. patients received no clear benefit for the higher cost. They saw, on average, more than 14 different doctors, compared with fewer than 10 for patients at the most efficient hospitals. But the extra visits did not seem to produce better outcomes. In fact, seeing more doctors may have caused harm, as patients ran the risk of side effects and complications from additional tests, treatments and medicines.
N.Y.U. will know that its innovations in weekend operations and doctor assessment are working if, in time, they help improve the cost-effectiveness of care. If they do, it's important that any practices found effective be adopted widely. Better ways of spreading such innovations will be the focus of my next column. In health care, experimentation is the mother of improvement.

HEADLINE: A Quest For Medical E-Records

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
There is no silver bullet for reforming America's health care system, but medical experts have long agreed that digital patient records and electronic prescribing can help improve care and curb costs.
It seems straightforward. Just combine technology skills with investment money, and then develop innovative products. But to date, the push for a digital revolution in doctors' offices has brought mostly frustration for the many companies big and small that are trying to conquer the field.
Just ask the Doerr brothers -- John Doerr, the well-known venture capitalist who was an early backer of Google and Amazon, and Dr. Tom Doerr, a physician and software designer.
Dr. Doerr founded a software company in 1999, beginning with an electronic prescribing product and later adding electronic health records. His brother is the largest investor. After more than a decade, the venture has fewer than 500 doctors using its software. 
The experience, Mr. Doerr said, has been ''a long, slow march.'' And Dr. Doerr conceded, ''It's been a lot harder getting to a business that is self-sustaining than I had imagined.''
But the Obama administration's economic stimulus package contained an ambitious program to encourage the market for electronic health records, with billions in incentive payments to buy and use digital patient records -- and eventually penalties for the failure to do so.
The Doerrs' software company is only one of many hoping to cash in on the national mandate for digital medical records. The companies range from giants like General Electric to specialists like Athenahealth that cater to small physician practices.
They, like the Doerrs, are betting that the law will help create a turning point for the economics of digital health records, opening the door to rapid adoption by doctors and a thriving business at last.
The brothers are also betting that Internet technology and Apple's iPad can make electronic records far easier to use and less expensive. Last week, they introduced a new product, Nimble, to allow doctors to manage patient information by connecting their iPads to data centers managed by the Doerrs' software company, ClearPractice.
The Doerrs' aging start-up is unusual in that it has evolved to extend its reach in health care beyond technology. The lessons it has learned along the way are a microcosm of the challenge of applying technology to health care.
To attack the problem of wayward financial incentives, the Doerrs bought a Medicare Advantage health maintenance organization, Essence Healthcare, in 2007, and shifted it toward paying doctors for helping make patients healthier. It now covers 50,000 people in six states.
They also built up a medical analytics software company, which tracks procedures and patient results for payers, enabling them to manage outcomes instead of just costs. The software also mines data to help hospitals and doctors make more informed decisions about treatments.
Their target market is doctors in small practices, with 10 physicians or less -- where digital records are used least. More than 70 percent of the nation's doctors are in such small practices.
The Doerrs' three companies are part of the Essence Group, based in suburban St. Louis, not far from where brothers grew up. Dr. Doerr, 53, is co-founder and head of clinical strategy of Essence, and Mr. Doerr, 59, is the largest shareholder.
Though a small private company, Essence has attracted the attention of some experts. Intrigued, Dr. Denis A. Cortese, former chief executive of Mayo Clinic and a professor at Arizona State University, joined the Essence board two months ago. It is trying to bring to small physician practices, he said, the kind of health care championed at Mayo.
''These guys may or may not be successful, but they've got the right ideas,'' Dr. Cortese said.
The goal, Dr. Doerr explained, is to deliver the better care and lower costs achieved by some large health care groups without being one. Essence, he said, is trying to combine technology tools, cooperative relationships between doctors and insurers, and financial incentives to create the ''virtual equivalent'' of an integrated system.
The goal also, of course, is to make money. Essence, though, does not have the look of a big winner anytime soon. It has 330 employees and yearly revenue of about $450 million. But the vast majority of the revenue comes from the Medicare insurer, which is like a regulated utility with modest profits.
If the Doerrs' venture is going to become a money-spinner someday, it will come from software, a business that can grow rapidly and profitably, if successful. For its new offering, ClearPractice worked closely with Apple to develop the Nimble, a service tailored for the iPad.
Using Nimble, doctors do not need other computers in their offices, since most of the software and patient information resides on remote computers in data centers managed by ClearPractice. A doctor's iPad connects to the patient data and software wirelessly, over the Internet, as if in a computer ''cloud,'' as this fast-growing model of computing is known.
Doctors pay a subscription fee of up to $499 a month if they choose all the ClearPractice offerings -- electronic prescribing, electronic health records and billing software.
''With the right software that is cloud-based, the iPad is going to be transformational in health care,'' Mr. Doerr said.
The right technology, medical experts say, can potentially overcome two major hurdles to the adoption of electronic health records by doctors: cost and complexity. Those obstacles are most pronounced in the market of doctors in small practices that the Doerrs are pursuing.
About one in five doctors now uses digital health records. But the percentage is far lower in small practices, while in larger, integrated health groups -- Kaiser Permanente, Mayo Clinic and others -- all use digital records.
The larger groups are big enough to afford the investment in electronic records, training and technical support. But they also use the electronic patient data as a tool to better manage patients with chronic conditions like diabetes and heart diseases, so they are healthier and less apt to require costly hospital care.
The groups use that performance-improvement data to market themselves to insurers and employers, and many are insurers themselves. So they have considerable economic incentive to use electronic records.
Yet such larger groups provide less than 15 percent of health care in America. For the rest, the dominant economic model is fee for service. The incentive is for more of everything -- more visits, more tests, more pills, more surgeries. The sicker the patient, the more lucrative.
For Mr. Doerr, his private health care venture has been an education. ''Our health care system,'' he said, ''is an absolutely dysfunctional circle where none of the participants -- patients, payers or providers -- are linked together in any kind of rational economic system.''
Until recently, doctors in small practices had no incentive to invest in electronic health records. They would bear the costs, but savings would go to insurers.
But with the federal stimulus package, the economic barrier will be lowered. The government plans to spend $19 billion in incentive payments -- up to $44,000 per doctor, and gave practices five years to adopt electronic records before penalties begin.
As an investment, Essence is a world apart from the classic Silicon Valley venture-capital mentality of finding the Next Big Thing. Mr. Doerr, who joined Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers three decades ago, has done that as successfully as anyone.
''Health care is a complex system, where the improvements and effects are felt over time,'' said Esther Dyson, an analyst, investor and friend of Mr. Doerr's. ''So in that sense, this is very different from conventional venture capital investments. It's not going to take off quickly.''
Still, at the headquarters in Maryland Heights, Mo., Mr. Doerr's team is thinking big. The chief executive of the Essence Group is Frank Ingari, who has known Mr. Doerr for 20 years, and headed a computer networking company that Kleiner had backed and helped take public.
Mr. Ingari, who is working Silicon Valley-style 80-hour weeks, speaks of health care technology as a ''tremendous opportunity'' both as a business and as a benefit to society. ''This is a missionary endeavor,'' he said.

HEADLINE: BATS; Rays Finish Season With a Title and a Win

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
With the American League East championship already in hand, the Tampa Bay Rays outlasted the Kansas City Royals, 3-2, in 12 innings Sunday to head into the playoffs on a winning note. 
Manager Joe Maddon's team learned it had clinched the division title in the ninth inning when the Yankees lost at Boston, 8-4. The Yankees and Tampa Bay began the day tied, with both teams already assured of playoff spots.
To win the division, the Yankees needed to finish ahead of the Rays, who held the tie breaker after winning the season series.
Tampa Bay will start the playoffs at home Wednesday against the Texas Rangers, the A.L. West champion.
A WIN IN TORRE'S FINAL GAME Matt Kemp homered and the Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Arizona Diamondbacks, 3-1, in their season finale, sending Joe Torre into retirement with a victory.
Torre has a 2,326-1,997 regular-season record. He went 259-227 in three years with the Dodgers.
BREWERS' MANAGER: I'M FIRED Brewers Manager Ken Macha is out of a job.
''They're not going to pick up my option,'' Macha told The Associated Press.
Milwaukee finished the season 77-85 with a 3-2 loss to the Cincinnati Reds, their second consecutive losing season.
BATTING TITLES DECIDED The Rangers lost to the Los Angeles Angels, 6-2, in their regular-season finale, but outfielder Josh Hamilton, who missed almost a month with broken ribs, won the A.L. batting title with a .359 average. ... In the National League, Colorado Rockies outfielder Carlos Gonzalez won the title with a .336 average. He missed the final two games of the season with a sore right hand. The Rockies ended the season with a 6-1 loss to the St. Louis Cardinals.
ATTENDANCE FALLS AGAIN Major League Baseball's average attendance dropped for the third straight season, falling 1 percent this year.
The 30 teams combined to draw 73.06 million fans, an average of 30,067, Stats LLC said.
Last year, in the midst of a global economic downturn, the teams drew 74.42 million, an average of 30,350. The average was a 6.7 percent drop from 2008's 32,527, when the total was 78.59 million.

HEADLINE: When Home Has No Place To Park

BYLINE: By IAN LOVETT

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- Every day, Diane Butler and her husband park their two hand-painted R.V.'s in a lot at the edge of Venice Beach here, alongside dozens of other rickety, rusted campers from the 1970s and '80s. During the day, she sells her artwork on the boardwalk. When the parking lot closes at sunset, she and the other R.V.-dwellers drive a quarter-mile inland to find somewhere on the street to park for the night.
Their nomadic existence might be ending, though. The Venice section of Los Angeles has become the latest California community to enact strict new regulations limiting street parking and banning R.V.'s from beach lots -- regulations that could soon force Ms. Butler, 58, to leave the community where she has lived for four decades. 
''They're making it hard for people in vehicles to remain in Venice,'' she said.
Southern California, with its forgiving weather, has long been a popular destination for those living in vehicles and other homeless people. And for decades, people living in R.V.'s, vans and cars have settled in Venice, the beachfront Los Angeles community once known as the ''Slum by the Sea'' and famous for its offbeat, artistic culture.
Yet even as the economic downturn has forced more people out of their homes and into their cars, vehicle-dwellers are facing fewer options, with more communities trying to push them out.
As nearby neighborhoods and municipalities passed laws restricting overnight parking in recent years, Venice became the center of vehicle dwelling in the region. More than 250 vehicles now serve as shelter on Venice streets, according to the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority.
''The only place between Santa Barbara and San Diego where campers can park seven blocks from the beach is this little piece of land,'' said City Councilman Bill Rosendahl, whose district includes Venice. ''Over the years, it's only gotten worse, as every other community along the coast has adopted restrictions.''
In the past, bohemian Venice was tolerant of vehicle-dwellers, but, increasingly, the proliferation of R.V.'s in this gentrifying neighborhood has prompted efforts to remove them.
''The status quo is unacceptable,'' said Mark Ryavec, president of the Venice Stakeholders Association, a group of residents devoted to removing R.V.'s from the area. ''It's time to give us some relief from R.V.'s parking on our doorsteps.''
A bitter debate has raged between residents who want to get rid of R.V.'s and those who want to combat the problems of homelessness in the community by offering safe places to park and access to public bathrooms. Last year, residents voted to establish overnight parking restrictions, but the California Coastal Commission twice vetoed the plan.
However, a recent incident involving an R.V. owner's arrest on charges of dumping sewage into the street has accelerated efforts to remove vehicle-dwellers. Starting this week, oversize vehicles will be banned from the beach parking lots; an ordinance banning them from parking on the street overnight could take effect within a month.
While Mr. Rosendahl supported parking restrictions, he has also secured $750,000 from the city to pay for a pilot program to house R.V.-dwellers. Modeled after efforts in Santa Barbara and Eugene, Ore., the Vehicles to Homes program will offer overnight parking for vehicle-dwellers who agree to meet certain conditions, with the goal of moving participants into permanent housing.
''For people who want help, we'll support them,'' Mr. Rosendahl said. ''The others can take their wheels and go up the coast or somewhere else, God bless them. It's not our responsibility to be the only spot where near-homelessness is dealt with in the state of California.''
While some have expressed interest in the program, many said they did not want to subject themselves to curfews and oversight or had no means or desire to return to renting. Mr. Ryavec believes few will participate.
''I will not debate that some people are mentally ill, indigent or drugged out,'' Mr. Ryavec said. ''But my stance is that the bulk of these people are making a lifestyle choice.''
Still, according to Gary L. Blasi, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, and an activist on homeless issues, most people choose to live in vehicles only when the alternative is sleeping in a shelter or on the street.
''The idea of carefree vagabonds is statistically false,'' Professor Blasi said. ''More often, these are people who lived in apartments in Venice before they lived in R.V.'s. The reason for losing housing is usually the loss of a job or some health care crisis.''
Even if all the vehicle-dwellers in Venice wanted to participate, the pilot program will accommodate only a small fraction of them. In Southern California, though, there may not be anywhere else R.V.'s can legally park. According to Neil Donovan, executive director of the National Coalition for the Homeless, ordinances banning R.V.'s have spread from metropolitan areas into the suburbs as vehicle-dwellers venture farther afield in search of somewhere to sleep.
''Communities are now forming a patchwork of ordinances, which virtually prohibits a geographic cure to the situation,'' Mr. Donovan said. ''If you're in a community and they tell you to leave, you can't just go to the next community, because they establish similar ordinances, especially in California.''
Mr. Donovan said vehicle-dwellers often end up on the street after their vehicles are towed or become inoperable. When his organization surveyed tent camps in California, they found that many residents had come from R.V.'s.
Vehicle-dwellers in Venice are now considering their options, but few expressed any intention of leaving.
''They can keep throwing more laws at us, but we're not just going to go away,'' said Mario Manti-Gualtiero, who lost his job as an audio engineer and now lives in an R.V. ''We can't just evaporate.''

HEADLINE: Wiping On,With Squeegee and a Smile

BYLINE: By COREY KILGANNON

 BODY:
Spotting a squeegee man used to elicit a grumble and a lot of useless waving-off gesticulation by the driver. Now a sighting of this rare species sparks a little charge, the way any New York City rarity -- a faux Checker cab or a seltzer man -- might.
There is the reflex to pull out cellphones and snap a picture of this emblem of a more unruly city in the 1980s, one that, save for sporadic sightings, all but disappeared after police crackdowns. 
One such sighting could be had, one recent afternoon, on West 111th Street and Frederick Douglass Boulevard. A man wearing a green shirt and baggy, rolled-up jeans, was working away on the windshields of cars stopped at the red light on West 111th Street. He said his name was David Morales, 39, of East Harlem, and he immediately qualified his prowess as a glass-cleaner -- ''I'm the best there is'' -- while continuing to approach cars wielding only the head of a squeegee -- no stick attached.
''This way, you can tuck it under your arm, in case the police come -- you can hide it,'' he explained. Of course, the easily concealed tool had a limited reach, so limited that Mr. Morales really addressed only half of each windshield, before asking the driver for a contribution.
''I don't see it as panhandling,'' he said. ''It's a service for a service -- better than shaking a cup.''
''Anyone can clean a windshield,'' he allowed. ''The trick is, you have to know how to talk to them. It's all in your personality. If it's a guy, you make them laugh. If it's a female, you have to say something like, 'Hey, you got a beautiful smile.' ''
Do not suggest to Mr. Morales that his chosen profession has drifted into the realm of New York City nostalgia. He has no interest in being depicted in some ''I Love N.Y.'' snow globe sold in Times Square. This has been his primary source of income since age 12 when he first cut his teeth working on dirty windshields of cars coming off the Queensboro Bridge, he said.
''When I was a kid, I'd quit once I got $20 or $30 in my pocket,'' he said. ''We'd make that and go back uptown.''
He spends his summers setting up and running carnivals in the suburbs. The rest of the year, he wipes. It yields about $100 a day, on average: a steady figure over the past decade, unchanged by boom or recession. In fact, he scoffed at the idea that his presence could be looked upon as a barometer of the economy or crime levels.
''It's just guys trying to make a living,'' Mr. Morales said. ''People talk about a recession, but people aren't digging into their retirements or their investments when they give change.''
''There's never been a recession for us,'' he said. ''It just got harder because the cops cracked down.''
Squeegee crackdowns were perhaps most severe under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who portrayed these men as a scourge of the city. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, upon succeeding Mr. Giuliani in 2002, also promised a squeegee-free city.
To that end, Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly established a Quality of Life Unit in 2002, with detectives who photograph violators like squeegee men, to better monitor problem spots and notify precinct commanders, said Paul W. Browne, the department's chief spokesman.
One problem with squeegee men is that they tend to delay traffic, Mr. Browne said. They can be cited for disorderly conduct.
Mr. Morales said he agreed with crackdowns in the case of aggressive squeegee men who menace drivers and leave windshields dirtier than they found them. He said he uses charm, not intimidation, but added that some drivers are alarmists and cower needlessly in the driver's seat.
''You get people who still think this is bad old New York,'' he said. ''Times have changed. No one's getting carjacked, no one's getting robbed in broad daylight in traffic.''
The best tippers are people driving into Manhattan, geared up for an evening out, he said. His best tip was a $100 bill from a man who owned a strip club and was eager to impress his date.
The worst days are rainy ones. ''The windshields are already washed, and no one's opening their windows,'' he said. And the best are post-snowstorm periods when windshields are caked with road salt. On very hot days, windows tend to be closed because of air-conditioning, but people do want water. So he buys bottles of water in bulk and sells them for a dollar apiece.
One can find work any place where drivers have to wait at a light and where police coverage is scant, he said, adding that the best spots are the arteries around Yankee Stadium on game day. When the Yankees are not playing, one can do well plying the service roads and on- and off-ramps along the Major Deegan Expressway.
''You got 145th, 155th Streets, the 138th Street Bridge,'' he said. ''They're all good spots.''
They tend to be working people, streetwise people not afraid to roll down their windows, Mr. Morales explained.
As he spoke, a police car pulled up, and an officer hopped out. ''You know you're not supposed to be here,'' he told Mr. Morales. Mr. Morales adopted an apologetic tone and said he would be on his way. The officer inspected his identification and, after a few minutes, let him off with a warning.
Mr. Morales flashed a smile and pulled out a wad of pink paper from his pocket -- summonses from previous offenses, he said. He gets cited every few weeks and usually wipes them clean with a day of community service.
''Cost of doing business,'' he said. He dropped his squeegee into his water bucket and headed uptown.

HEADLINE: In Nomura's Aggressive Push Into the U.S., Lehman Is Omnipresent

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY; Susanne Craig and Peter Lattman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The discreet sign by the door does not say Lehman Brothers. But step inside: a bit of Lehman lives on here in Manhattan.
Two years after Lehman's collapse, hundreds of former Lehman employees are working together again at the Wall Street headquarters of Nomura, the Japanese brokerage giant.
The Lehmanization of this tradition-bound Japanese bank is startling. The head of investment banking came from Lehman. So did the chief risk officer, who held a similar post at Lehman. The top global economist, the co-heads of fixed income, senior salesmen, traders -- the list goes on. 
The arrivals are part of one of the most aggressive -- and potentially most risky -- expansions under way on Wall Street. Nomura, a heavyweight in Japan, is a perennial also-ran in the United States. But in the wake of the financial collapse, its executives sense an opening.
Rivals scoff at the idea that Nomura can break into the big leagues here. Nomura tried in the 1980s, and again in the 1990s and 2000s.
''The Japanese banks have always wanted to come here for the prestige,'' said Edward Lincoln, director of the Center for Japan-U.S. Business and Economic Studies at New York University. ''This is the place you have got to be, but they have never made much headway.''
And yet at a time when giants of American finance have begun to cut back again, Nomura is hiring. Today it employs 1,900 people inside the World Financial Center in Lower Manhattan and its eight other offices in the United States and Canada. That is up from 650 two years ago.
Nomura bought Lehman's international operations in September 2008, swelling its global work force by more than 8,000 in Europe and Asia.
In the United States, Lehman's investment banking and capital markets operations, and 10,000 Lehman workers, were swallowed by Barclays, the British bank. Not all stayed on there, however. After the merger, Barclays laid off 3,000 employees, many from Lehman, who scattered across Wall Street.
Since then, Nomura has become something of a Wall Street melting pot: everyone, it seems, came from someplace else.
But for the people in the Lehman diaspora who have coalesced here, the new Nomura feels like a homecoming.
''Coming here meant reuniting with many of my former colleagues from Lehman,'' said Michael P. Guarnieri, who spent 12 years at Lehman before joining Nomura last year as global head of bond research.
Still, skeptics like Mr. Lincoln see a culture clash coming. They wonder if Nomura will be willing -- or able -- to offer the big paydays that many American bankers have come to expect.
Naoki Matsuba, the president and chief executive of Nomura's American operations, is confident that this time his bank will succeed. ''This is a once in a lifetime opportunity,'' he said.
Mr. Matsuba represents the will of Nomura's ambitious president and chief executive back in Tokyo, Kenichi Watanabe. Mr. Matsuba said that in the wake of the financial collapse, companies and investors would think twice about their bankers.
''We believe that the landscape will change in a tough market,'' he said.
From Mr. Matsuba's glass-fronted end-office on the sixth floor, you can see bankers from all over Wall Street -- from Bear Stearns, Bank of America, Deutsche Bank, Barclays, Citibank, Goldman Sachs.
Lehman was a strong bond house, and many of the former Lehman people at Nomura are on the fixed income side, whereas the new staff on the equities side of the firm come more from all over Wall Street.
A former Bank of America executive, Ciaran O'Kelly, a wiry Irishman, is running Nomura's expanded equities operations. David Steck, from Deutsche Bank, heads foreign exchange.
Yet of the roughly 1,000 new workers, about 250 arrived from Lehman Brothers. Among them are people like Jeffrey Michaels and Charles Spero, the joint heads of Nomura's fixed income division, where the head count has risen to 360 people, from 60.
''We have the advantage of growing while many other banks are shrinking,'' Mr. Michaels said.
''It is a good position to be in.''
Some of the new employees are refugees from the shake-up since the financial crisis and seem glad to still have a job. They acknowledge that taking business from the established Wall Street firms is going to be hard.
Others, however, are stars poached from rivals.
Nomura is making much of its recent hiring of one of Wall Street's best brokerage analysts, from UBS, as well as a widely respected media industry analyst, from Sanford C. Bernstein.
It is also beefing up its investment banking business, run by the former Lehman banker Glenn H. Schiffman. The staff count in investment banking has rocketed to about 100, from 12 at the start of the year.
Last month, Nomura hired five new members in its natural resources investment banking team, in addition to four investment bankers on its media team, including three with backgrounds at Lehman.
The chatter on Wall Street is that, despite the Japanese reluctance to pay big salaries, scores of new hires are being lured by hefty amounts, including some on generous two-year guaranteed contracts. Nomura executives deny they are paying above the market rate.
In February Nomura raised $3 billion on international debt markets, its first United States public bond sale, to back its push in the United States and globally. In another sign of its ambition, after giving up its license in November 2007, last year it once again became a primary dealer in the Treasury bond market.
It still has a long way to go: Nomura ranks 17th in United States-marketed bond underwriting so far this year, compared with 25th in 2009, according to Dealogic.
It is even further down the league tables, at 35th, in mergers and acquisition advice.
But it is taking some strides forward: its newly assembled fixed income analysts team was ranked seventh for 2010 in a closely watched Institutional Investor survey, the first time Nomura has even been ranked.
And so, for the moment, this Japanese bank has a bit of Wall Street swagger.
''As a new entrant and a challenger in the U.S. marketplace, competitors are not always aware of Nomura,'' Mr. O'Kelly said. ''This will change.''

HEADLINE: Easy Borrowing By Corporations Spurs Few Jobs

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY

 BODY:
As many households and small businesses are being turned away by bank loan officers, large corporations are borrowing vast sums of money for next to nothing -- simply because they can.
Companies like Microsoft are raising billions of dollars by issuing bonds at ultra-low interest rates, but few of them are actually spending the money on new factories, equipment or jobs. Instead, they are stockpiling the cash until the economy improves.
The development presents something of a chicken-and-egg situation: Corporations keep saving, waiting for the economy to perk up -- but the economy is unlikely to perk up if corporations keep saving.
This situation underscores the limits of Washington policy makers' power to stimulate the economy. The Federal Reserve has held official interest rates near zero for almost two years, which allows corporations to sell bonds with only slightly higher returns -- even below 1 percent. But most companies are not doing what the easy monetary policy was intended to get them to do: invest and create jobs. 
The Fed's low rates have in fact hurt many Americans, especially retirees whose incomes from savings have fallen substantially. Big companies like Johnson & Johnson, PepsiCo and I.B.M. seem to have been among the major beneficiaries.
''They are benefiting themselves by borrowing and keeping this cash, but it is not benefiting the economy yet,'' said Dana Saporta, an economist at Credit Suisse in New York.
American corporations have been saving more money since the financial collapse of 2008. But a recent rush of blue-chip bond offerings -- including a $4.75 billion deal last month by Microsoft, one of the richest companies in the world -- has put even more money in their coffers.
Corporations now sit atop a combined $1.6 trillion of cash, a figure equal to slightly more than 6 percent of their total assets. In the first quarter of this year it was 6.2 percent of assets, the highest level since 1964, when it was 6.4 percent.
When will they start spending that money -- in particular, by hiring?
That is part of what has become the great question of this long, jobless recovery: When will corporate America start to feel confident enough to put its cash to work, building factories and putting some of the nation's 14.9 million unemployed to work?
Businesses are holding on to their protective cash cushions, worried perhaps that the economy could slip back into recession or at least grow too lethargically to make an investment worthwhile.
The nation's corporations will be strong, well capitalized and ready to act aggressively when executives finally decide it is time to expand their businesses.
After running up sharply every quarter since mid-2008, the ratio of cash holdings to assets by corporations fell slightly for the first time in the second quarter of this year.
Although investment in factories and plants still languishes, companies have spent some money on investment in new equipment and software. That spending grew at an annualized rate of more than 20 percent in the first two quarters of this year.
But economists say that such investment is still below its peak before the financial crisis.
In addition, many of the new machines and computers may be replacing older machines companies put off retiring in the recession. Businesses are playing catch-up, and little expansion is occurring.
''They may actually be using this new investment to be more efficient and cut jobs,'' said Michael Gapen, an economist at Barclays Capital. ''The mix of signals right now is still telling corporations to sit tight and wait.''
Mr. Gapen said those signals included the direction of the housing market, the outcome of midterm election, the effects on the economy as the fiscal stimulus wears off and any changes in tax policy.
They are deciding, ''Why don't we just wait until the first quarter of next year?'' he said.
The cheap money may be having yet another effect unintended by policy makers eager to cut the nation's 9.6 percent unemployment rate. Several of the corporations borrowing billions on bond markets are using the money to put their own financial house in order rather than to create jobs.
Microsoft said it was using some of its money to buy back shares, other companies are locking in longer-term borrowing, and some of the new borrowing is financing an increase in mergers and acquisitions.
All of this may enrich the corporations' shareholders and cut company costs in the long run, but it does not necessarily lead to more jobs and it does not represent the big investments in growth that could fuel a sharp economic recovery for everyone.
''They are still holding on to more cash in the same way that Noah built the ark,'' said David Rosenberg, chief economist at Gluskin Sheff & Associates in Toronto. ''It is very telling.''
In the case of Microsoft's bond offering, one factor might have been avoiding a big tax bill, said Richard J. Lane, who analyzes Microsoft for Moody's. If Microsoft had needed cash, it could have pulled some from its operations abroad, but ''borrowing new money on the debt markets is now cheaper than bringing its own money back from overseas,'' Mr. Lane said.
Microsoft's offering was only its second; its first was last year. The second offering included three-year debt at an interest rate of 0.875, among the lowest on record for that type of borrowing.
According to the financial data provider Dealogic, United States companies have borrowed $488 billion on the American high-yield and investment grade bond markets so far this year, 7 percent more than businesses borrowed during all of 2009, and on track to at least match the $589 billion borrowed in the boom year in 2007, which was the highest on record.
Smaller companies continue to have trouble borrowing, and most of the new financing is limited to bigger corporations.
Their borrowing spree is in contrast to America's households, which continue to cut their debt and consumption. Perhaps unsure of the recovery, like the corporations hoarding cash, Americans are saving far more than they have in years, and some economists fear that consumers' frugality will further hobble growth.
One of the biggest corporations to borrow recently, the DuPont Company, said it was using the cheaper money to lock in borrowing over a longer period.
''The current low interest rate environment provides DuPont a great opportunity to refinance our long-term debt at lower rates,'' it said in a statement.
Conditions have become so good that some companies are borrowing money they will not have to repay until the next century. In August, the railroad Norfolk Southern Corporation borrowed $250 million in 100-year bonds at an annual rate of 5.95 percent.
Robin Chapman, a spokesman, said, ''Opportunistic borrowing is a good way to characterize this.'' He said that the company was seeing a ''slow and steady pickup'' in rail traffic but that any hiring the company was doing was to replace workers lost through attrition.
Other companies are borrowing to finance acquisitions. PepsiCo borrowed recently to help pay for the takeover of two bottling plants. Hertz borrowed $300 million for its bid to buy a rival car rental company, Dollar Thrifty.
Economists say it is rational for companies to seize the opportunity to borrow at low interest rates and to buy back shares. But Guy LeBas, a fixed income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Chicago, said, ''It is not particularly beneficial for economic conditions.''

HEADLINE: Cuomo's Campaign Manager, For Good or Ill, Is in the Mirror

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

 BODY:
Andrew M. Cuomo was driving his staff crazy.
After months of being coy about his plans to run for governor, Mr. Cuomo, New York's attorney general, was finally ready to make it official. But for weeks, in countless meetings and phone calls with his advisers, he plotted and replotted. No detail escaped his deliberation.
Would he anger New York City voters by having the kickoff upstate or alienate suburbanites by holding it in Manhattan? If he stood in front of the Statehouse in Albany, would he look like a conquering hero -- or a sleazy insider?
Would releasing his 224-page platform -- finally finished after the near-endless rewrites he had demanded -- before the announcement distract from the actual event, or would it be ignored in the shuffle if he released it afterward? Should he send out a press release or post a video on his Web site? And if he only posted a video, would the news media cover it? 
''He argued the up- and downside of every single aspect of everything, over and over and over again,'' said one person involved in the discussions.
Much has changed since Mr. Cuomo made his announcement in downtown Manhattan on an afternoon in May, most notably the emergence of the Buffalo businessman Carl P. Paladino as an energetic opponent in the race.
But one thing remains the same: Mr. Cuomo, who got his start in politics managing his father's campaigns, cannot seem to stop managing his own.
That has given the well-financed and heavily favored Cuomo candidacy a herky-jerky quality: Like Mr. Cuomo, it is cautious, endlessly deliberative and intensely secretive, though flaring with bursts of sudden action and genuine passion.
Those involved with Mr. Cuomo's campaign say the candidate weighs in on decisions large and small, including when to announce major policy initiatives and whether to respond to a press inquiry, leading to what some of them call ''paralysis by analysis.''
''He wants to be on top, in charge, and he feels like he knows how to do everything as well as anybody else and probably better,'' said Norman Adler, a political consultant who, though not advising Mr. Cuomo this year, has known him since they worked together on Mr. Cuomo's father's 1982 campaign for governor. ''His approach is 'I'll make all the decisions.' ''
If Mr. Cuomo is sometimes consumed by campaign strategy, his aides and advisers say, it is in no small part because he has a first-rate political mind. His brain is so wired for strategy, they say, that he can spin out almost endless situations -- move upon move upon countermove -- of how a course of action might unfold.
But because he has not fully entrusted anyone else with managing the operation, the campaign has at times become trapped by the candidate's overthinking, most noticeably in the critical days after Mr. Paladino's upset victory in the Republican primary.
During a meeting of his team at his campaign headquarters in Lower Manhattan the day after the election, Mr. Cuomo, over a speakerphone, told his aides it was not the time for aggressive moves. All that was needed to nip Mr. Paladino's surge in the bud, the candidate concluded, was to ensure that the news media, women's groups and civil rights activists knew about the racist and pornographic e-mails Mr. Paladino had admitted forwarding to friends, said several people briefed later on the meeting and the strategy that emerged from it.
But in the days that followed, Mr. Paladino shrugged off the e-mails with jokes about his political incorrectness, basked in his newfound celebrity and began taking swings at his Democratic opponent -- while Mr. Cuomo faced growing criticism from editorial pages and fellow Democrats, who wondered why he was not responding forcefully.
''There is a very ubercautious approach,'' said one Cuomo aide, who like nearly everyone interviewed for this article spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of being frozen out by Mr. Cuomo. ''When you're that tight and that cautious, it can boomerang.''
Mr. Cuomo absorbed the criticism and, aides said, decided to fight back but to avoid the kind of personal attacks and name-calling that Mr. Paladino had aimed at him. At Mr. Cuomo's direction, aides scheduled a major policy speech last week on jobs and unemployment, hoping to turn the debate toward substantive issues. And in recent days, it is Mr. Paladino who has been on the defensive, after a confrontation with a New York Post reporter and unsubstantiated accusations he made about Mr. Cuomo's personal life.
Yet problems remain. Mr. Cuomo consults widely with friends and aides but often defers major decisions. Some senior aides do not feel empowered to make decisions on their own because they are worried the candidate will second-guess them, creating bottlenecks on matters as basic as whether to do a news conference or where to hold an endorsement meeting.
Other aides, while acknowledging that Mr. Cuomo is deeply involved in the campaign, insisted that he delegated effectively when it mattered and handed over to deputies at least two important responsibilities: creating and placing campaign advertisements and building a turnout operation, the latter a task he had closely supervised on past campaigns. They also said he was better at listening to his staff members than many elected officials were.
The campaign's slow initial response to Mr. Paladino, they said, was mostly because of the sheer difficulty of figuring out how to respond to the Republican's unusually caustic campaign style and to his surprisingly friendly reception from the news media.
And those who have been around the Cuomo family for years said the attorney general was far more pragmatic and action-oriented than his father, former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, whose reputation for indecisiveness earned him the nickname ''Hamlet on the Hudson.''
''Andrew has always preferred flatter organizational structures,'' said Benjamin Lawsky, the campaign's general counsel.
The structure of Mr. Cuomo's campaign, Mr. Lawsky said, mirrored those he established at the housing nonprofit he ran in the 1980s; at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, where he was secretary; and in the attorney general's office.
''He tends to have four or five senior deputies who oversee the organization, who all report back directly to him,'' Mr. Lawsky said. ''It's a management style that's worked for him in the past, and it's working for him now.''
Mr. Lawsky and other aides said they believed that Mr. Cuomo's campaign had settled into the right rhythm in recent days, counterattacking Mr. Paladino without resorting to coarse campaigning. And Mr. Cuomo's fund-raising and standing in the polls remain strong.
Yet even now, Mr. Cuomo can seem halting. On Wednesday, when asked by a reporter whether his attacks on Mr. Paladino's Tea Party supporters should be taken as a broader indictment of the Tea Party movement, Mr. Cuomo lapsed into lawyerly parsing.
''What I think I said was, Mr. Paladino's brand of Tea Party is an extreme group,'' he said. ''You have a number of Tea Parties. As a matter of fact, you have other Tea Party candidates for governor in the state of New York, at least one. Mr. Paladino has a Tea Party, too. And my position is, Mr. Paladino's Tea Party has an extremist platform that is out of touch with the people of the state of New York.''
Mr. Cuomo made those comments at an endorsement rally with the abortion rights group NARAL Pro-Choice New York. But that rally -- a political layup for a Democratic candidate with Mr. Cuomo's record on reproductive rights -- took months to set up, people involved in the preparations said. The event was not locked down until the day before, leaving the organizers racing at the last minute to muster a large crowd. In the end, Mr. Cuomo stood before a few dozen people, many of them interns and staff members from the group.
Indeed, Mr. Cuomo's travel schedule and public appearances are often planned at the last minute, leaving little time for aides to prepare him for questions.That has led to some embarrassing flubs, like one last week in which Mr. Cuomo, accepting the endorsement of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, seemed flummoxed when asked by a reporter whether he had ever voted for Mr. Bloomberg.
Mr. Cuomo said he had, a puzzling admission given that Mr. Bloomberg's opponent last year, William C. Thompson, the former city comptroller, was now co-chairman of the Cuomo campaign. But later that day, a spokesman said Mr. Cuomo had misspoken; he did not live in the city during the 2009 campaign and had supported the mayor's Democratic opponent in the previous election.
Though the campaign in August trumpeted the hiring of a deputy campaign manager, Patrick Jenkins, no such announcement has been made for the post of campaign manager. That role has been informally played by Joseph Percoco, a former special counsel in the attorney general's office who is prized by Mr. Cuomo for his loyalty, discretion and skills as a political fixer.
Yet Mr. Percoco appears to function less as a chief executive than as an extension of Mr. Cuomo's will. Other than Mr. Cuomo, no single person on the campaign appears to be in charge of coordinating messaging, scheduling and policy development.
''If you had a campaign manager who was in charge of all these things, you'd fire him,'' said a Cuomo adviser who spoke anonymously to preserve access to the campaign while bluntly assessing its shortcomings.
Mr. Cuomo, of course, cannot be fired. And perhaps he cannot be changed. A New York Times article from 1982, when Mr. Cuomo, then 24, managed his father's winning campaign for governor, describes an operation not unlike Mr. Cuomo's own campaign today.
The reporter observed that the younger Mr. Cuomo had ''an intuitive skill at motivating people and developing strategies,'' but added that neither father nor son ''quite succeeds in giving the frenetic campaign headquarters in Manhattan's garment district a semblance of orderliness. There are never enough telephone lines, for example, and the candidate's daily schedules often seem subject to whimsy.''

HEADLINE: Day of a Strike Dawns For Detroit Musicians

BYLINE: By DANIEL J. WAKIN

 BODY:
The Detroit Symphony Orchestra has weathered decades of strikes, deficits, criticism over its racial makeup, mediocre concert homes, cuts in state aid and canceled tours.
It has always bounced back, rescuing and restoring its beautiful old concert hall, enjoying moments of critical acclaim and recording fame, and becoming a leader in efforts to bring blacks into the symphony world (although it still has only three black players).
Now it faces another hurdle, one that its members and managers say could alter its course for good. The players, who were scheduled to begin rehearsals on Monday morning for the new season, have declared their intention to strike over extensive cuts in pay and benefits and extensive changes in how they perform their jobs.
As so often happens in orchestra labor strife, one side raises alarms about quality and the other about survivability. The musicians argue that the kind of cuts sought by management would scare away top new talents and even current members, eroding the orchestra's finely wrought musical level. 
''The bottom line for us is, we want the artistic quality of the orchestra to stay the same or get better,'' said Haden McKay, an orchestra cellist and the players' spokesman. ''The cuts are so deep, it's really going to damage the quality of the orchestra long term.''
Management contends that the issue of quality will be moot if the orchestra dies, and that Detroit simply cannot afford an orchestra of the kind that now exists. ''The contract has to reflect what's sustainable in the city you're living in,'' said Anne Parsons, the orchestra's president and chief executive.
''You can't have excellence if you don't have viability,'' Ms. Parsons added. ''Who would want to come to an orchestra that's on the edge of financial disaster?'' she said of prospective members.
Acrimony has escalated in recent weeks. The musicians denounced the cancellation of their life insurance and instrument insurance policies once the strike was declared even though players said they were willing to pay the premiums themselves. ''The only word I can use is punitive,'' Mr. McKay said.
Ms. Parsons responded: ''We are following the letter of the law completely. If you walk off the job, you walk off the job.''
Further, orchestra lawyers told the musicians not to use the institution's name in staging concerts on their own or to make it appear that money raised for the musicians was in fact going to the orchestra itself. The Web site they have established to make their case is detroitsymphonymusicians.org.
Several players marched at the front of the Labor Day parade in Detroit.
The Detroit Symphony's music director, Leonard Slatkin, has stayed out of the labor dispute. He is still scheduled to open the season on Friday, with a program of William Schuman's ''American Festival'' Overture, Bruch's Violin Concerto No. 1 (with Sarah Chang as soloist) and Berlioz's ''Symphonie Fantastique.''
The musicians' contract expired on Aug. 29. A mediator met with both sides on Sept. 24, but no progress resulted.
So the players called the strike, which would be the orchestra's fifth since 1969, and management immediately imposed its offered contract terms: a reduction in the number of guaranteed paid weeks in the season that would lead to a 33 percent cut in guaranteed base salaries in the first year followed by slight rises in the next two years. New players would start at 42 percent less than the current guaranteed base, $104,650. The offer also involves cutbacks in pension and health benefits.
The players had offered a 22 percent reduction in the first year, with raises bringing them in the third year to within 8 percent of where they are now. Many orchestra players' associations have agreed to salary givebacks in recent years, but none at that level.
Yet few cities have suffered like Detroit. And that argument has helped generate support for management's side. The Detroit News, in an editorial on Thursday, pointed out that household incomes in Michigan have dropped 21.3 percent over the last decade and that 16.2 percent of the population now lives below the poverty level.
The players, it argued, should make the same sacrifices Michigan's other workers have had to make and should not risk the orchestra's future with a strike.
''Union-protected jobs with six-figure salaries are scarce in today's Michigan,'' the newspaper said. ''The musicians should hang on to theirs with both hands, and pray along with the rest of us for a future that returns our state to prosperity.''
But management's plan is ''not a pathway to survival,'' said Bruce Ridge, the chairman of the International Conference of Symphony and Opera Musicians. ''It's the beginning of the end.''
''The Detroit Symphony is an incredibly positive force in the middle of a city that needs positive forces,'' Mr. Ridge added.
Another issue that has infuriated the players is a proposal that they be required to take part in activities beyond rehearsing and performing onstage for symphonic concerts. That could mean playing chamber music, coaching student ensembles, teaching in schools, even giving talks. Ms. Parsons said the changes were part of figuring out a ''sustainable business model'' for the orchestra.
Orchestra musicians often take on such duties, but usually for extra pay or on a voluntary basis. Administrators said that the players would not be assigned duties beyond what they normally do or in ways that would hurt the orchestra's quality. Much of the coaching and teaching would take place in the orchestra's extensive education programs.
''They want us basically to be their servants and be sent out if it's musically related,'' Mr. McKay, the players' representative, said. ''The people at this level in the profession want to do what they are trained to do.'' The musicians say that they would be willing to discuss such job changes in the future but not in the context of a major pay cut.
There is little doubt that the orchestra is in serious financial trouble and is hemorrhaging money. Management blames the recession and rising labor costs. Declines in ticket sales and donations have also taken a toll, as they have in orchestras around the country.
The Detroit Symphony is projecting a $6.5 million operating deficit from the last season and a $3.6 million shortfall from the one before. Add pension obligations and rising interest payments on debt taken on to refurbish what is now called the Max M. Fisher Music Center, and the symphony will be $9 million in the hole for the 2009-10 season, it said. Banks will no longer lend it money, it added, and it is raiding its endowment to pay for operations.
Its unrestricted endowment funds will go to a projected $23 million this season from $47 million two seasons ago, the orchestra said.
Even with the pay cuts just imposed, Ms. Parsons said, the operating deficit for the 2010-11 season would be $1.4 million. ''We're still in the hole,'' she added, ''and we still have to work hard to get out of this hole.''
Detroit's economic problems have been an acute factor in the orchestra's problems. Big-city orchestras always suffer when companies decline or move away, and the Detroit Symphony is a grave example. Consider the bailouts of General Motors and Chrysler needed to keep afloat companies that in the past each gave in the six figures annually.
''Their giving went pretty close to zero the past fiscal year,'' Ms. Parsons said. ''We've got board members whose pensions have disappeared.''
Correction: October 5, 2010, Tuesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Monday about a strike by the musicians of the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, using information from an orchestra official, misstated the number of black players in the symphony, which faced criticism over its racial makeup and then became a leader in trying to bring blacks into the symphony world. There are three, not two.

HEADLINE: Who's In?

 BODY:
As the global economic balance shifts, the United States and other of the post-World War II powers say they're ready to make room. The Group of 8 rich countries ceded to the Group of 20, where the interests of Germany and France must vie with those of India. Despite that, the maneuvering before this week's meetings of the International Monetary Fund suggest that the big players may not be as ready as they claim. 
The I.M.F. is not as significant as it was 50 years ago, when it policed a system of fixed exchange rates. It still has a major role to play, with hundreds of billions to prop up countries that run into financial trouble. Developing countries -- which have long resented the fund's demands that they open up their markets -- are eager to have more of a say in its deliberations.
Last year, leaders of the G-20 agreed to shift at least 5 percent of the fund's quota share (akin to shares in the fund's capital) from overrepresented countries, like Canada or Belgium, to underrepresented ones, like Turkey or Brazil. Brazil, Russia, India and China are pushing for a 7 percent shift. European Union countries -- they account for a fifth of the world economy yet have more than a third of the fund's quota share, and name 9 of its 24 directors -- have been especially reluctant to cede. The United States has been willing to give up some of its roughly 17 percent stake, but has balked at proposals that would cut it to 15 percent and deprive it of its veto (decisions need 85 percent of the vote to pass).
This process has also set off fierce haggling -- all around -- about how clout should be defined. Should G.D.P. be measured at market exchange rates, which make rich countries like Japan look bigger, or using ''purchasing power parity,'' which favors countries like China where things are cheaper? Should it include population, as India demanded?
Since the end of the cold war, even the old Western allies have lost some of their shared sense of purpose. That, in part, explains why Belgium isn't eager to let France represent its interests at the table. There is more than self-interest at play. The new powers clamoring for a place don't necessarily share the institution's values -- especially the I.M.F.'s passion for free capital markets.
That is not an argument to keep the newcomers out. Bringing them into the room is the best chance of persuading them to assume the full responsibilities of their new power, and of building a new global consensus.

HEADLINE: More Countries Adopt the Tactics of China in Fight Over Currency Policies

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and MICHAEL WINES; David E. Sanger reported from Washington, and Michael Wines from Beijing. Alexei Barrionuevo contributed reporting from Sao Paulo, Brazil, Steven Erlanger from Paris, and Martin Fackler from Tokyo.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- As the Obama administration escalates its battle with Chinese leaders over the artificially low value of China's currency, a growing number of countries are retreating from some free-market rules that have guided international trade in recent decades and have started playing by Chinese rules.
Japan and Brazil have taken measures recently to devalue their currencies, or at least prevent them from appreciating further against the Chinese currency, the renminbi. The House of Representatives last week overwhelmingly passed the first legislation to allow the United States to slap huge tariffs on Chinese goods unless China allows the renminbi to appreciate, another mechanism for making Chinese goods more expensive here and American exports more competitive in China.
In Europe, policy makers have begun to fret that, despite the debt crisis that sent investors fleeing just a few months ago, the euro has now risen sharply again against the dollar, potentially weakening exports by making European goods more expensive. Those exports have been one of Europe's few sources of growth, and President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, who will take over leadership of the Group of 20 biggest economies, said over the weekend that he was pushing for a new system of coordinating global currencies as wealthy nations did in the 1970s, before a free market orthodoxy took hold. 
It is unclear if the result will be a ''currency war,'' as Brazil's finance minister recently warned, or if these are just warning shots, fired to force Beijing's leadership to make good on years of promises that it would allow the value of its currency to appreciate.
But that question is so in the air that Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner felt compelled last week to try to dampen the fear. ''We're not going to have a trade war,'' he said at a forum sponsored by The Atlantic. ''We're not going to have currency wars.'' He acknowledged that the only way to break the cycle was for a country ''to decide it is in its own interest to allow its currency to appreciate in response to market forces,'' and he said he believed that a ''substantial fraction of the Chinese leadership'' now understands the need to allow the currency to rise in value.
But it is unclear how far the Chinese are willing to go, since a more expensive currency means more expensive exports and a possible loss of jobs. ''It's a tradeoff for the Chinese leadership,'' said one senior United States official who has talked at length to China's top officials. ''They are under pressure from governors and mayors who fear unemployment in China's manufacturing territory, exactly what we are struggling with.''
But the fact remains that the rest of the world is beginning to mimic the technique China has perfected: manipulating currencies for national advantage, while resisting political pressure from trading partners.
Some economists argue that the standoff over China's currency could herald a new era of protectionism reminiscent of the 1920s and '30s, which they say they fear could undermine trade and make a weak recovery even weaker. But others argue that it was the free-market consensus of the 1980s and '90s that weakened American competitiveness and was exploited by rising powers like China, calling for a more assertive policy to protect jobs, increase exports and keep industry at home.
''Everyone's playing beggar-thy-neighbor games, willingly or unwillingly,'' Michael Pettis, a Peking University professor and economist at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said in an interview. ''This is very similar to what happened in the '30s, when the collapse in Europe's ability to finance itself also meant a collapse in its trade deficit, and the world rushed around trying to find a new equilibrium in which every country tried to grab a larger share of the dwindling global demand.''
Of course, many countries have manipulated their currencies before -- the United States reached a political accord with Japan in the Reagan administration to do exactly that, in an effort to reduce a yawning trade deficit. And for decades, despite global rules prohibiting the practice, countries have sought to help their industries by providing subsidies to companies, as Europe did for years with Airbus, its competitor to Boeing.
But many around the world fear getting trampled as the United States and the Chinese battle each other. Japan intervened in the currency markets recently for the first time in six years, after accusing China of driving the yen up to a 15-year high, in part by buying Japanese debt. But it was a short-term move, many Japanese experts fear. ''Japan is in a sense losing out in this competitive devaluation war'' through inaction, said Kazuo Ueda, a professor of finance at the University of Tokyo, and a former member of the policy board of Japan's central bank.
Brazil took similar action and vowed last week to take whatever action it needs to prevent its currency from appreciating. Its finance minister, Guido Mantega, said in an interview that the actions by developed countries, including the United States, to keep interest rates at record lows, one way of devaluing a currency, was a ''strategy from the past'' that was threatening the economy of Brazil and other ''dynamic'' emerging markets.
''This is a kind of desperate action taken by countries to try to activate their economies,'' Mr. Mantega said. ''Since they have not been able to activate their own internal markets, the way out becomes exports. So developed countries work on devaluing their currency in order to become competitive in the few dynamic markets in the world.'' Most Western governments, and many economists, place the blame for currency frictions on China, which has refused to let the renminbi trade at anywhere near its real value. Moreover, China has subsidized its exports with artificially low interest rates that shift money from consumers' bank deposits into cheap loans to businesses.
These tactics are nothing new, especially among the emerging economies of Asia. But experts say the sheer size of the Chinese economy means that its currency policies have global effects.
Not surprisingly, the Chinese see the problem differently. The Chinese press is filled with articles arguing that Americans do not appreciate China's efforts on their behalf. While other nations' currencies devalued against the dollar in the 2008 financial crisis, some economists note, the renminbi did not. And while Chinese exports may be artificially cheap, the effect has been to give American shoppers bargains at the expense of Chinese consumers.
''Nobody thinks about that,'' Shen Minggao, the chief China economist for Citibank, said in a telephone interview from Hong Kong. ''Should China think about the welfare of Chinese consumers, not U.S. consumers?''
China could solve much of the problem by shifting to an economy driven by domestic consumption instead of profits from exports. And in principle, Chinese experts agree.
But China's progress toward that goal has been glacial. Since June, when the government said it would move the renminbi closer to its real value, the currency has gained about 1 percent. Most experts say the real value is 15 percent to 20 percent higher.
A variety of economic and political factors limit China's flexibility, said Li Daokui, who directs Tsinghua University's Center for China in the World Economy. Dr. Li sits on the government's Monetary Policy Committee, which advises China's central bank, and stressed he was not speaking for the government. If China lets its renminbi gain value too quickly, he said, that could make exports too expensive and collapse an entire sector of the economy. That would spike unemployment and risk social unrest, which Chinese leaders are committed to avoiding.
Dr. Li said that a ''mild appreciation'' of the renminbi was needed, but that ordinary Chinese need to be prepared for even that small step. Otherwise, he said, ''it's counterproductive, because many people believe there's a conspiracy to keep the Chinese economy from growing.''

HEADLINE: First Monday

 BODY:
The Supreme Court enjoys all but free rein in selecting which cases to review. From the end of one term in the summer until the start of the next, on the first Monday in October, the work of the court is to sift through thousands of petitions from parties that lost in one of the federal appeals courts or highest state courts and are eager for the justices to reverse their fate.
The kinds of petitioners favored say a lot about the court's interests and biases. The Warren court, eager to champion individual rights, chose a large number of petitions from downtrodden people. The Rehnquist court, looking for opportunities to vindicate states' rights, favored petitions from the states. 
The Roberts court has championed corporations. The cases it has chosen for review this term suggest it will continue that trend. Of the 51 it has so far decided to hear, over 40 percent have a corporation on one side. The most far-reaching example of the Roberts court's pro-business bias was Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission. By a 5-to-4 vote, the conservative justices overturned a century of precedent to give corporations, along with labor unions, an unlimited right to spend money in politics.
Equally striking is that the court reached far beyond what the parties had argued, to make a sweeping change in constitutional law. It could have upheld the right of the conservative nonprofit group to show an anti-Hillary Clinton movie on a video-on-demand service during the primary season -- without opening the door to a new era of political corruption.
The cases scheduled for argument in the next few months may appear modest. But if there is one lesson from the Citizens United ruling, it is that nothing -- for this court -- is inevitably modest. There are two areas of business law particularly worth watching: ''pre-emption'' and protection of employees from retaliation.
In four cases, the court will address an obscure but significant debate on federal pre-emption of state law. The pro-pre-emption view is often pro-business, because it interferes with state efforts to protect citizens against corporate misconduct. Pre-emption can also protect against state interference with the national economy.
In AT&T Mobility v. Concepcion, the cellphone provider claims that California contract law has been used to frustrate the Federal Arbitration Act. If the company wins, it will likely force unhappy customers to rely on an arbitrator to resolve their differences with the company. If the respondents win, they will likely be able to bring AT&T Mobility to court -- to answer accusations of fraud for promising ''free'' phones, then charging for the tax on their retail value. That would be good for consumers.
In two cases, the court will address the extent to which whistle-blowing employees are shielded by federal statute. In Thompson v. North American Stainless, the company fired Eric Thompson when it learned that his co-worker and then-fiancee had filed a charge of sex discrimination against the company. She was protected from reprisal. The court is asked to say whether anyone closely associated (a fiance, spouse, or family member) is also protected.
Not all of the arguments the court will hear deal with corporate interests. This Wednesday, in Snyder v. Phelps -- a particularly important First Amendment case -- the justices will hear argument about one of the anti-gay protests staged by members of a Kansas Baptist church at funerals of American soldiers. They must decide whether this repugnant form of demonstration is protected by the Constitution, as seems right.
Next month, the court will consider another First Amendment issue: whether free speech is infringed by a California law restricting the sale or rental of violent video games to minors. It will also hear argument in a case involving the amendment's establishment clause and whether an Arizona program providing tax credits to people who donate money to schools improperly favors religious organizations.
Each case forms a universe of distinct issues and interests, but, as Citizens United reminds us, an individual ruling can reshape our democracy. This term feels especially momentous because it is the first for Justice Elena Kagan and only the second for Justice Sonia Sotomayor. While the court's 5-to-4 balance hasn't changed, we can hope that their pledges of judicial modesty will influence the court's performance.

HEADLINE: An Award, Criticism and Perils for Comcast

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

 BODY:
Criticizing Fox News is a year-round sport for many hosts on MSNBC, the cable news channel, and especially for Keith Olbermann, whose verbal spitballs at the Fox host Bill O'Reilly have occasionally put his parent company, NBC Universal, on edge.
Pending government approval, MSNBC will soon have a new parent company, Comcast, and that may prove to be awkward for Mr. Olbermann and other TV critics of Fox. As a distributor of cable programming, Comcast is in business with Fox and its parent company, the News Corporation.
The business interests of Comcast and the News Corporation were brought to light in a lawsuit by Barry Nolan, a Comcast employee whose protest of Mr. O'Reilly cost him a $200,000-a-year job two years ago. Mr. Nolan later protested his firing, and last month, he lost the case.
In an extensive review of Mr. Nolan's case for the Columbia Journalism Review in August, the writer Terry Ann Knopf asserted that Mr. Nolan's firing reflected the ''corrosive influence of over-concentrated corporate power.'' 
Dan Kennedy, an assistant professor of journalism at Northeastern University who wrote about the firing for The Boston Phoenix newspaper in 2008, said Mr. Nolan ''learned a lesson in how seriously media corporations take their relationships with other media corporations.''
Citing the impending merger of Comcast and NBC -- it is awaiting regulatory approval -- Mr. Kennedy said, ''Keith Olbermann may prove to be Barry Nolan writ large.''
Last year, NBC Universal and the News Corporation tried to tamp down the televised combat between Mr. Olbermann and Mr. O'Reilly, with limited success. Even NBC's parent, General Electric, waded into the fray.
But the sparring was also good for business, at least for Mr. Olbermann, who was taking on a more popular competitor and gaining attention by doing so.
Mr. Nolan did not appear to be seeking attention when he took on Mr. O'Reilly. In 2008, he was the host of a talk show for a Comcast regional channel, called CN8 at the time. He became incensed when the New England chapter of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, of which he was a member, decided to give an award to Mr. O'Reilly, a conservative and controversial prime-time host on Fox.
To Mr. Nolan, Mr. O'Reilly was a bully who played loose with the facts, unfit for an award. So he spoke up, not on Comcast's airwaves, but in a series of e-mail messages from his Comcast account, petitioning the academy's board members and complaining about the award in a newspaper interview.
Comcast later said in a legal filing that Mr. Nolan's protest ''jeopardized and harmed the business and economic interests'' of the company because Comcast and Fox were ''actively engaged in contract renewal negotiations at the time of Nolan's protest.''
The News Corporation is one of the biggest suppliers of content to Comcast, with contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
Days before the awards show, which was to be televised by CN8, Mr. Nolan's boss, Eileen Dolente, counseled him not to create ''a scene'' or involve Comcast in his protest. Mr. Nolan says he did not; he simply handed out pamphlets that quoted Mr. O'Reilly's broadcasts (and a harassment lawsuit leveled at Mr. O'Reilly in 2004), and stood up and walked away from his seat at Comcast's table when the award was presented.
In Comcast's view, Mr. Nolan blatantly defied an order by his boss. On May 12, two days after the awards event, he was suspended for two weeks without pay.
Documents that were unearthed in the lawsuit revealed how prickly Mr. O'Reilly can be when attacked. On the day Mr. Nolan was suspended, Mr. O'Reilly sent a complaint about him straight to the chief executive of Comcast, Brian L. Roberts. On corporate letterhead, Mr. O'Reilly wrote that he and Fox News, FNC for short, considered Comcast to be an ''excellent business partner,'' and for that reason, ''it was puzzling'' to see Mr. Nolan ''use Comcast corporate assets to attack me and FNC.''
''All of us here hope this situation will subside and that is why I am bringing it to your attention,'' Mr. O'Reilly added.
There is no proof that Mr. Nolan's suspension -- or his firing later that month -- occurred because of Mr. O'Reilly's complaint. But for Mr. Nolan, it is easy to connect the dots.
Asked what he thought happened, Mr. Nolan said, ''O'Reilly threw a little fit and wrote a letter to Brian Roberts, and inferred in lawyerly language that this would have an effect on our business relationship. And Brian Roberts, in what I think is a kind of gutless caving to a man like O'Reilly, says, 'Fire the guy.'''
Presented with that version of events, Comcast said in a statement, ''Barry Nolan was terminated by CN8 for the reasons he was told -- insubordination.''
In a lawsuit, Mr. Nolan accused Comcast of interfering with his free speech rights. Comcast called that claim baseless, and on Sept. 21, a district court judge struck down the suit, finding that Mr. Nolan's employment agreement allowed Comcast to terminate him ''for any reason, or no reason at all.'' Mr. Nolan said on Sunday that he intended to appeal.
Mr. Nolan said he feared Comcast's takeover of NBC Universal because of what it might mean for Mr. Olbermann and other critics of Fox. He said, ''Under Comcast, is this the way the news division is going to be run?''
David L. Cohen, an executive vice president for Comcast, said, ''We have been quite clear about our irrevocable intent to preserve the journalistic independence of NBC News, even making a written commitment on the same day we announced the transaction to that effect.''
In May, Mr. Roberts was asked in an onstage interview at a cable conference about the news division and said, ''The single most awesome asset that comes from this deal is NBC News.''
In any case, Mr. Olbermann said in an e-mail message on Sunday that there was no comparison between him and Mr. Nolan. ''I've run into O'Reilly many times in public -- at Yankee Stadium as recently as a month ago -- and never have instigated, and never would dream of instigating, something like that,'' he wrote. ''For that matter, I don't think Bill would, either.''

HEADLINE: China Speaks Out On a Stable Euro

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
ATHENS (Reuters) -- China pledged on Sunday to support a stable euro and not reduce its holdings of European government bonds. 
China, trying to deflect criticism of its currency policy ahead of a European-Chinese summit meeting this week, emphasized its willingness to cooperate with the European Union.
''I have made clear that China supports a stable euro,'' Premier Wen Jiabao said during a visit to Greece at the start of a one-week European tour. ''We will not reduce the holdings of European bonds in our foreign exchange portfolio,'' he added.
Beijing is at loggerheads with the United States over the valuation of the renminbi, and Mr. Wen is likely to face similar complaints during his tour of European countries this week.
On Saturday, he offered to buy an unspecified amount of Greek government bonds when Athens resumes issuing, and on Sunday he said he was glad Greece was starting to emerge from the shadows of its debt crisis.
Policy moves by China to free the renminbi from a dollar peg will help the Chinese currency rise, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, head of the International Monetary Fund, said Saturday.

HEADLINE: It's Time for Democrats to Attack, Pelosi Says

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
If Washington normally blends the business of government with electoral politics, this week signifies a turn toward an unalloyed electoral brawl.
Democratic Congressional leaders have sent members home without resolving their greatest outstanding disagreement with Republicans, over the Bush tax cuts due to expire at year's end. After months on the defensive as Republicans surged in the polls, Speaker Nancy Pelosi calls it time for Democrats to attack.
''You have to understand what fighters our members are,'' Ms. Pelosi told a group of columnists late last week. Indeed, she ascribed the Democrats' political travails to their refusal to ''play patty-cake'' with powerful economic interests as they pursued a health care overhaul, new regulations for the financial industry and energy legislation capping carbon emissions. 
''Now our challenge is to tattoo the practices of big insurance, big oil, big banks and the rest'' onto Republican opponents, Ms. Pelosi said. ''And our members feel very good about doing that.''
Republicans face a different challenge as their House and Senate candidates enter the homestretch. In stump appearances, direct mail, television advertisements and debates, they aim to keep voters focused on the sources of discontent that have brightened their chances of regaining power all year.
Those include rising government spending, high budget deficits and, most important, the 9.6 percent unemployment rate. Republicans will get new ammunition from an employment report to be released on Friday, in which forecasters expect the unemployment rate may tick up, even if the economy adds private-sector jobs for the ninth consecutive month.
Because underlying trends have worked so strongly in their favor, the Republicans' goal is to play the political equivalent of no-turnover football. That's evident in the decision to duck budget-cutting specifics in their ''Pledge to America'' campaign manifesto, and in Republican leaders' concentration on low-profile fund-raising.
Republicans concede that many races across the country are tightening as Democratic voters, heretofore unenthusiastic, begin rallying behind their candidates. But they insist that that modest trend will be overwhelmed as Republican campaign committees, reinforced by amply-financed outside groups, amass enough cash to match their Democratic counterparts and grind down majority party incumbents.
''Once we even up on money, as we will in October, I think G.O.P. momentum will re-assert itself,'' said Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, a veteran Republican strategist.
By contrast, Democrats enter the final month of campaigning needing to force the action. President Obama, with his agenda at risk, will try to help this week in two ways.
One is by projecting a national message of action to build America's economic future. The president will hold events in Washington on Monday and Tuesday focused on strengthening work-force-training partnerships between community colleges and private industry.
The other is by rousing core Democratic partisans, especially members of minorities and young people, who are not expected to turn out on Election Day in anywhere near the strength they demonstrated in 2008. On Thursday, Mr. Obama will appear alongside Gov. Martin O'Malley, who is seeking re-election in Maryland. On Sunday, Mr. Obama will hold the second of his large-scale campaign rallies in Philadelphia.
Like the president, Ms. Pelosi aims to alarm Democratic voters with the prospect that Republicans would spend the next two years trying to undo the achievements of the last two years.
''If we don't win, they will try to unravel this,'' she said. ''Members don't have to go out and defend the entire - every chapter and verse of the health care bill. But they have to tell people what is at stake in terms of the reforms that people understand.''
Unlike the president, Ms. Pelosi has not tried to turn Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the House minority leader, into the face of the Republican opposition. She referred to that strategy as a ''freelance'' maneuver by the White House that she had not initiated.
Yet she insisted that she didn't mind efforts to take aim at her; Republicans may be raising campaign funds through their ''fire Pelosi'' appeals, but ''so am I,'' she said. Nor, with her speakership on the line, does she object to Democrats in conservative districts appealing to their constituents by criticizing her.
''I say go for it,'' Ms. Pelosi said. She would counsel those vulnerable Democrats, ''Just win your election.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Fear and Favor

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
A note to Tea Party activists: This is not the movie you think it is. You probably imagine that you're starring in ''The Birth of a Nation,'' but you're actually just extras in a remake of ''Citizen Kane.''
True, there have been some changes in the plot. In the original, Kane tried to buy high political office for himself. In the new version, he just puts politicians on his payroll. 
I mean that literally. As Politico recently pointed out, every major contender for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination who isn't currently holding office and isn't named Mitt Romney is now a paid contributor to Fox News. Now, media moguls have often promoted the careers and campaigns of politicians they believe will serve their interests. But directly cutting checks to political favorites takes it to a whole new level of blatancy.
Arguably, this shouldn't be surprising. Modern American conservatism is, in large part, a movement shaped by billionaires and their bank accounts, and assured paychecks for the ideologically loyal are an important part of the system. Scientists willing to deny the existence of man-made climate change, economists willing to declare that tax cuts for the rich are essential to growth, strategic thinkers willing to provide rationales for wars of choice, lawyers willing to provide defenses of torture, all can count on support from a network of organizations that may seem independent on the surface but are largely financed by a handful of ultrawealthy families.
And these organizations have long provided havens for conservative political figures not currently in office. Thus when Senator Rick Santorum was defeated in 2006, he got a new job as head of the America's Enemies program at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a think tank that has received funding from the usual sources: the Koch brothers, the Coors family, and so on.
Now Mr. Santorum is one of those paid Fox contributors contemplating a presidential run. What's the difference?
Well, for one thing, Fox News seems to have decided that it no longer needs to maintain even the pretense of being nonpartisan.
Nobody who was paying attention has ever doubted that Fox is, in reality, a part of the Republican political machine; but the network -- with its Orwellian slogan, ''fair and balanced'' -- has always denied the obvious. Officially, it still does. But by hiring those G.O.P. candidates, while at the same time making million-dollar contributions to the Republican Governors Association and the rabidly anti-Obama United States Chamber of Commerce, Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, which owns Fox, is signaling that it no longer feels the need to make any effort to keep up appearances.
Something else has changed, too: increasingly, Fox News has gone from merely supporting Republican candidates to anointing them. Christine O'Donnell, the upset winner of the G.O.P. Senate primary in Delaware, is often described as the Tea Party candidate, but given the publicity the network gave her, she could equally well be described as the Fox News candidate. Anyway, there's not much difference: the Tea Party movement owes much of its rise to enthusiastic Fox coverage.
As the Republican political analyst David Frum put it, ''Republicans originally thought that Fox worked for us, and now we are discovering we work for Fox'' -- literally, in the case of all those non-Mitt-Romney presidential hopefuls. It was days later, by the way, that Mr. Frum was fired by the American Enterprise Institute. Conservatives criticize Fox at their peril.
So the Ministry of Propaganda has, in effect, seized control of the Politburo. What are the implications?
Perhaps the most important thing to realize is that when billionaires put their might behind ''grass roots'' right-wing action, it's not just about ideology: it's also about business. What the Koch brothers have bought with their huge political outlays is, above all, freedom to pollute. What Mr. Murdoch is acquiring with his expanded political role is the kind of influence that lets his media empire make its own rules.
Thus in Britain, a reporter at one of Mr. Murdoch's papers, News of the World, was caught hacking into the voice mail of prominent citizens, including members of the royal family. But Scotland Yard showed little interest in getting to the bottom of the story. Now the editor who ran the paper when the hacking was taking place is chief of communications for the Conservative government -- and that government is talking about slashing the budget of the BBC, which competes with the News Corporation.
So think of those paychecks to Sarah Palin and others as smart investments. After all, if you're a media mogul, it's always good to have friends in high places. And the most reliable friends are the ones who know they owe it all to you.

HEADLINE: Rising Health Premiums

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''About Your Premiums'' (editorial, Sept. 25):
The rise in premiums for individual health insurance policies is actually an argument for the health care reform that Congress passed this year. As you note, the recession has led many now-healthy individuals to drop coverage, leaving the burden on those who have the foresight to maintain insurance or need it to pay their medical expenses.
That is exactly why the reform includes a requirement that almost all Americans must have coverage: to spread the risks, and the costs, across the population.

HEADLINE: Public Libraries: Endangered or Saved?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Outsourcing Fairly Healthy Public Libraries, Town Hears a Roar'' (front page, Sept. 27):
The American Library Association opposes shifting policy making and management oversight of library services from the public to the private sector, not because of its impact on job security, but rather because communities may lose access to trained information professionals -- librarians.
I disagree with the statements by Frank Pezzanite, the chief executive of Library Systems & Services, the private company that runs 14 library systems operating 63 locations. Implying that library staffs are just waiting around to cash in on retirement, when in fact there are thousands of librarians serving 1.5 billion visitors a year with dedication, assumes that people will fall for the ''demonization'' of the public sector. 
Libraries and their employees, who are often paid salaries far below the demands placed on them and the education required for their positions, serve as a lifeline for millions of Americans.
From free access to books and online resources to library business centers that help support entrepreneurship and retraining, libraries with top-notch staff are needed now more than ever in our increasingly competitive global economy.
Publicly funded libraries should remain directly accountable to the publics they serve.
Roberta Stevens Pres., American Library Association Chicago, Sept. 27, 2010
To the Editor:
It's refreshing to see you focus on challenges facing America's libraries. But the article portrays Library Systems & Services as ambivalent or hostile toward library staff. I want to clarify L.S.S.I.'s viewpoint.
L.S.S.I. is a company of library advocates. We respect the contributions of dedicated librarians and library staff who are often unsung heroes, fostering a love for reading and promoting literacy. L.S.S.I. values our staff members; they are responsible for the success of the libraries we operate.
L.S.S.I. brings efficiencies and innovations to libraries, including increased and more responsive services in communities that want local control of library operations and a better return on taxpayers' dollars. Our documented results include creative library programming, customer-centered service, re-energized library staff and greater accountability.
Patrons and library staff will tell you the sky didn't fall when L.S.S.I. came to town; it brightened.
Our vision is to ensure that public libraries remain free, vibrant centerpieces of their communities.
Frank A. Pezzanite President and Chief Executive Library Systems & Services Germantown, Md., Sept. 29, 2010
To the Editor:
Yesterday, while I was working on the reference desk in a suburban public library, a middle-aged man came for assistance. He was going back to college, and he needed peer-reviewed articles on the management of electronic medical records.
He was not sure how to begin, so I showed him the various databases we provide, taught him how to do a subject search for his material, and then gave him the format in which to cite his articles.
If people think that a library volunteer can do that, they are very much mistaken.
I am a professional librarian with 35 years of experience in public and academic libraries.
There are many dedicated librarians like me, professionals who enjoy assisting and teaching the public where to find the knowledge they seek. We bond with, and are vested in, our communities, colleges, patrons, students; many people ask for us by name to assist them.
To disrespect and disregard the work that we do, as the management of an outsourcing company seems to, is a sad commentary on how deeply the ''bottom line'' mind-set has taken hold in our country.
Margaret M. Churley River Edge, N.J., Sept. 27, 2010
To the Editor:
As an elected city and county library board member for a number of years, I find that the rapid changes in needs of libraries in keeping up with the times, combined with what can be seen as a rapid decrease in financing, is direly affecting our plans and dreams.
Our goal is to increase the number of patrons by inviting them in and having the offerings they are looking for. And so much more.
If a private company, steeped in libraries, is able to provide a light at the end of the tunnel, I see no reason not to look into it. Our financial ruts are only getting deeper.

HEADLINE: New Fuel for Local Papers: Ads for Medical Marijuana

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
COLORADO SPRINGS -- When it hit the streets here last week, the latest issue of ReLeaf, a pullout supplement to The Colorado Springs Independent devoted to medical marijuana, landed with a satisfying thud.
Forty-eight pages in all, it was stuffed with advertisements for businesses with names like Mile High Mike's, Happy Buddah and the Healthy Connections (which enticed potential customers with promises of ''naughty nurses'' to tend to patients' needs).
A full-page ad in ReLeaf costs about $1,100, making the publication a cash cow for The Independent, which has used its bounty from medical marijuana ads this year to hire one new reporter and promote three staff members to full time.
The paper has also added a column called CannaBiz that follows news from across the country; its author is the new marijuana beat writer. 
What would happen in the many communities now allowing medical marijuana had been a subject of much hand-wringing. But few predicted this: that it would be a boon for local newspapers looking for ways to cope with the effects of the recession and the flight of advertising -- especially classified listings -- to Web sites like Craigslist.
But in states like Colorado, California and Montana where use of the drug for health purposes is legal, newspapers -- particularly alternative weeklies -- have rushed to woo marijuana providers. Many of these enterprises are flush with cash and eager to get the word out about their fledgling businesses.
''Medical marijuana has been a revenue blessing over and above what we anticipated,'' said John Weiss, the founder and publisher of The Independent, a free weekly. ''This wasn't in our marketing plan a year ago, and now it is about 10 percent of our paper's revenue.''
It is hard to measure what share of the overall market they account for, but ads for medical marijuana providers and the businesses that have sprouted up to service them -- tax lawyers, real estate agents, security specialists -- have bulked up papers in large metropolitan news markets like Los Angeles, San Francisco and Denver.
''This is certainly one of the fastest growing industries we've ever seen come in,'' said Scott Tobias, president and chief operating officer of Village Voice Media, which publishes alternative weeklies across the country.
Alternative weeklies are not the only publications raking in medical marijuana lucre. Dailies like The Denver Post and The Bozeman Daily Chronicle in Montana are taking advantage of the boom and making no apologies.
''My point of view is, for the moment at least, it's legal,'' said Stephanie Pressly, publisher of The Daily Chronicle, adding that the paper generates about $7,500 a month in advertising from medical marijuana businesses. ''The joke around here is that it's a budding business.''
Newspaper publishers saw an opening for medical marijuana advertising after the Obama administration said last fall that it would not prosecute users and suppliers of the drug as long as they complied with state laws. Though many states have made legal allowances for medical marijuana for nearly a decade (the total now is 14 and the District of Columbia), that decision freed more people to market and sell it as a medical product.
Advertising demand for the drug grew so quickly in Village Voice Media's Western markets that the company started publishing supplements late last year. It gave them cheeky names like ''Chronic-le'' in Denver and ''The Rolling Paper'' in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Orange County. The tag line in Denver displayed underneath a smiling, sauntering, sandal-wearing cartoon joint reads, ''Your Guide to Medical Marijuana. Enjoy.''
In Colorado, where people have likened the explosion of medical marijuana to the state's 19th-century gold rush, the market for ads and information about the drug has been especially strong. The summer 2010 issue of The Chronic-le, at 48 shiny pages, included features like ''Toke of the Town,'' a summary of the latest marijuana-related news, and a roster of the nearly 250 stores in the Denver area that sell marijuana.
Mr. Tobias said that in Denver money from advertising for marijuana-related businesses has totaled 15 percent of the weekly Westword's revenue this year and nearly 40 percent of its classified advertising revenue. A small, eighth-page display ad on one of the paper's glossy inside pages can cost $550.
As other advertisers pulled back, spending by marijuana-related businesses has filled the gaps, Mr. Tobias said. ''There were less jobs, so there was less employment advertising. The rentals and real estate market collapsed to some degree, so there were less ads for those,'' he said. Medical marijuana, he added, ''is a welcome revenue stream.'' In the California papers, marijuana revenue is smaller, but it still provides a boost. It totals 8 percent of The OC Weekly's revenue; at The SF Weekly it is 5 percent.
But the drug is more than just a profit center for Westword. It has become a journalistic staple for the paper. Westword's editor, Patricia Calhoun, has attended public hearings on marijuana laws and live-blogged about them herself. Articles about marijuana on the paper's Web site remain one of its biggest draws.
''I said the industry is growing faster than the coverage is,'' Ms. Calhoun recalled. ''So we really ramped it up.''
Last year Westword hired a part-time marijuana critic who goes by the pseudonym William Breathes. The paper insists on keeping his identity a secret.
Mr. Breathes, 29, a graduate student who was a reporter for a daily paper in the Denver area before being laid off, proudly claims to be a living, breathing (and smoking) example of the economic benefits of medical marijuana.
''It's created journalism jobs -- well, at least one,'' Mr. Breathes said. His work, published in Westword's ''Mile Highs and Lows'' column, now includes more than just smoking marijuana, which he said he uses medically for chronic stomach problems. He also reports on services, like a video chat forum for marijuana smokers who want company when they light up, and he blogs about marijuana-related news.
The explosive growth of the medical marijuana business has some worried about the ultimate buzz kill: that the bubble is about to burst.
In Colorado Springs, where liberal marijuana policy has run head on into the city's active community of social conservatives, voters will decide next month on a ballot initiative that would ban medical marijuana sellers in unincorporated areas of El Paso County. In Montana the Legislature is expected to take up proposals to more strictly regulate medical marijuana use, including limiting the amount of the drug a patient can buy each month.
At The Missoula Independent, where medical marijuana advertising now makes up about 10 percent of the paper's revenue, there is concern that the spigot may soon tighten.
Matt Gibson, The Independent's president, said marijuana businesses have helped carry the paper through a rough recession. ''It's been stressful for us for several years,'' he said. ''There's no question that they've been good for our business. And we're worried about 2011, if the state revises the statute, which it appears is all but certain.''
Indeed, in the latest issue of ReLeaf, many of the ads have a fire-sale quality to them. One medical marijuana provider offers five free joints to new customers, another promises buyers a free pipe packed with marijuana and a free week of yoga, making the headline on an article a few pages later all the more foreboding: ''Tightening regulations, crowded market make for dicey days.''

HEADLINE: Shift at the Top of Twitter As a Founder Steps Aside

BYLINE: By CLAIRE CAIN MILLER

 BODY:
Evan Williams, the co-founder and chief executive of Twitter, is stepping down to lead product strategy at the company, Twitter announced on Monday. Dick Costolo, the chief operating officer, will succeed Mr. Williams.
The company, which announced the change in a blog post, is navigating a period of rapid growth and beginning to build an advertising business.
In the two years that Mr. Williams has been chief executive, Twitter has grown to 300 employees from 20; the service's registered users have ballooned to 160 million from three million; and the company has started to generate revenue. 
The news was unexpected. Though technology blogs had raised the question of whether Mr. Costolo would eventually become chief executive since he was hired a year ago, Mr. Williams had always insisted that he wanted the job. But on Monday, he and Mr. Costolo both said the decision was Mr. Williams's choice and that he wanted to get back to his roots, working on the product. The moves were effective immediately.
Mr. Williams said in an interview that he realized he wanted to focus on product strategy while he was working on Twitter's new Web site, introduced during the last month. ''I was reminded that maybe that's where my passion and skills lie,'' he said, ''and I couldn't focus on that as much as I'd like.''
Fred Wilson, a partner at Union Square Ventures who is on Twitter's board, said, ''It's a very smart and gutsy move for Ev to do so.'' He added that Mr. Costolo was ''more of a manager, more of an executive, more of a businessman'' than Mr. Williams.
Though the titles are new, Mr. Williams and Mr. Costolo had already divided many of their responsibilities along those lines. Mr. Costolo has been focusing on business development, like deals with Google and Microsoft, and revenue, including overseeing the introduction of Promoted Tweets and other forms of Twitter ads.
Twitter's new Web site was Mr. Williams's brainchild, and he spent much of the last few months working with Twitter engineers on the fine details of building it.
Mr. Costolo is a three-time chief executive, most recently at FeedBurner, which he helped to found and sold to Google. He will take over the day-to-day duties of running and expanding the company and continue to be the public face of its financial side. He made the company presentation to advertising executives at the Interactive Advertising Bureau's conference in New York last week, alongside executives from Facebook and Google.
Mr. Williams's new role will be a homecoming. He was chief product officer of Twitter before replacing Jack Dorsey, another Twitter founder, as chief executive at the end of 2008. Twitter was founded in 2006 by Mr. Williams, Mr. Dorsey and Biz Stone, and started as a project inside Odeo, Mr. Williams's last company.
Mr. Williams and Mr. Costolo have been friends for years, and Mr. Costolo was an early investor in Twitter. When he moved to the Bay Area last year, he wrote a Twitter post explaining to his mortgage broker that he was unemployed. Mr. Williams replied with a private Twitter post asking Mr. Costolo if he wanted to be interim chief executive while Mr. Williams went on paternity leave.
''I don't know if you're joking,'' Mr. Williams recalls the response from Mr. Costolo, who was once an improvisational comedian. ''If so, good one. If not, let's talk.''

HEADLINE: Cities in Debt Turn to States, Adding Strain

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
Harrisburg, the capital of Pennsylvania, dodged financial disaster last month by getting money from the state to make a payment to its bondholders.
It did so even though the state warned that the money had to be used for city workers' pensions.
Now Harrisburg is calling on the state again. On Friday, the city said it could not meet its next payroll without money from the state's distressed cities program.
Across the country, a growing number of towns, cities and other local governments are seeking refuge in similar havens that many states provide as alternatives to federal bankruptcy court. Pennsylvania will have 20 cities and smaller communities in its distressed-cities program if Harrisburg receives approval. Michigan has 37 in its program; New Jersey has seven; Illinois, Rhode Island and California each have at least one. This is on top of troubled housing, power and hospital authorities.
The increasingly common pleas for state assistance -- after two relatively quiet decades -- reflect the yawning local budget deficits that have appeared in the last two years. 
As tax revenue has fallen, the cost of providing labor-intensive government services, like teaching and policing, has proved hard to reduce.
The programs, which vary by state, generally allow troubled communities to tap emergency credit lines while restructuring their finances with some form of state oversight.
Many places may indeed bridge shortfalls and make necessary changes in services.
But some public finance experts worry that the states, mired in their own financial problems, will not force communities to attack their problems head-on and solve them. If states let towns keep borrowing, without acknowledging the magnitude of the towns' existing debts -- like the pensions they owe retired public workers -- they might never solve their problems and just keep drawing on the states. They could end up like miniature versions of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, stuck in conservatorships under government oversight with no clear way out.
''It's like throwing you a life preserver but never pulling you into the boat,'' said Daniel Miller, a certified public accountant and the city controller in Harrisburg. He says he believes that the city might be better off in federal bankruptcy court.
Worse yet, the municipal requests for state assistance could spell problems for already beleaguered state finances. One head of a municipal bond trading desk at a major Wall Street firm said he worried more about problems bubbling up from the local level than he did about the possibility of a sudden state collapse.
If the downturn is prolonged and deep, and local governments fail to act aggressively, he said, dozens of small communities could be pushed into the arms of a state, weighing it down so much that it, too, would need a bailout. Something like that happened in Arkansas during the Great Depression, causing the only default by a state on general-obligation bonds in United States history.
Harrisburg's problems have been building for years. The mayor wants assistance from the state, while a majority of the City Council wants to explore federal bankruptcy. Because of the disagreement, the city has not raised taxes enough or cut services enough to address its budget gap. Meanwhile, the city is being sued for failing to honor its guarantee of bonds issued by an incinerator authority.
Using the pension money to pay bondholders last month has increased the city's total debt burden, by the state's calculation. The city's audited financial statements are a year late, and the most recent one gives four-year-old pension data, showing a surplus before the recession and the financial crisis took its toll.
Critics see little incentive for the city to take really difficult steps, like confronting public employees' unions or taxing the nonprofit groups that own more than half of Harrisburg's real estate but pay no property taxes.
Mr. Miller, the city controller, worries that the city will merely sell assets like parking garages and parks to generate cash for the short term without tackling its bigger structural problems.
When New York City had its financial crisis in the mid-1970s, it grabbed several life preservers that soon proved inadequate, before the state came up with tough measures that forced the city to make painful cutbacks -- and, eventually, helped it to turn the corner.
New York City's ability to restructure outside bankruptcy suggests that state assistance programs could be made to work and may provide a better option than a federal bankruptcy filing, said James E. Spiotto, an expert on municipal bankruptcy law with the firm Chapman & Cutler in Chicago.
In California, Orange County was unable to get out from under all its debts in a federal bankruptcy, and Vallejo is still struggling to emerge from bankruptcy court after two years.
A state-supervised program, on the other hand, could reassure the bond markets that a town is not trying to repudiate its debts.
''What it is doing is providing a supervising adult, where the municipality has to report to someone,'' Mr. Spiotto said. ''It means you have to address the issue and fix it, not put a Band-Aid over it.''
Until now, the municipal bond markets have paid little attention to smaller cities. Scranton, Pa., and East St. Louis, Ill., may continue to lumber along for years on state assistance, without harming their states' abilities to borrow.
Many more towns could join them before bond investors get cold feet. Harvey, Ill., though not in a state conservatorship yet, may be headed there; its credit was recently downgraded to junk status, as was the rating of Central Falls, R.I., in May when it sought a court-appointed receiver. Toledo, Ohio, openly discusses a state receivership, as does Detroit.
But as more localities seek state assistance, the markets are starting to wake up.
The situation is particularly acute in Pennsylvania, where the flailing of a state capital has drawn considerable attention. Late last year, Reading joined the state's distressed program. Ways to exit the program have often been elusive. Eleven municipalities have been in the state's program for more than a decade. They were joined there five years ago by Pittsburgh.
Public finance experts say Pennsylvania's ''home rule'' form of government, where tiny boroughs and townships have full municipal powers, make the problem knottier. If one local government takes the bitter medicine and raises taxes, residents can dodge the increase by moving a few blocks away.
The state undertook some financial reform in the 1980s, when a number of municipal pension funds failed. It began requiring all towns to make minimum pension contributions, and to make sure, it promised to send them the money each year.
Officials in Harrisburg said they saw no harm in using this year's state pension money to pay their bondholders because they thought the municipal pension funds had a surplus.
But they see a surplus only because they are looking at a five-year-old number, said Bernard S. Kozlowski, deputy director of the state Public Employee Retirement Commission, which administers the state pension law. He said the state would eventually come after Harrisburg, demanding the missing money with interest. But not for at least two more years, he added, because of the lags built into the state system.

HEADLINE: Mining Trash for Rare Earths

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI; Keith Bradsher contributed reporting from Hong Kong.

 BODY:
KOSAKA, Japan -- Two decades after global competition drove the mines in this corner of Japan to extinction, Kosaka is again abuzz with talk of new riches.
The treasures are not copper or coal. They are rare-earth elements and other minerals that are crucial to many Japanese technologies and have so far come almost exclusively from China, the global leader in rare earth mining.
Recent problems with Chinese supplies of rare earths have sent Japanese traders and companies in search of alternative sources, creating opportunities for Kosaka.
This town's hopes for a mining comeback lie not underground, but in what Japan refers to as urban mining -- recycling the valuable metals and minerals from the country's huge stockpiles of used electronics like cellphones and computers. 
''We've literally discovered gold in cellphones,'' said Tetsuzo Fuyushiba, a former land minister and now opposition party member, who visited here recently to survey Kosaka's recycling plant.
Kosaka's pursuits have become especially important for Japan in recent weeks. Two weeks ago, amid a diplomatic spat with Tokyo, China started to block exports of all rare earths to Japan.
The shipping ban was still in effect on Monday evening in Japan, an industry official said, though a trickle of shipments seemed to be seeping out as a result of uneven enforcement of the ban by customs officers at various ports. China has allowed exports of Chinese-made rare earth magnets and other rare earth products to Japan, but not semi-processed rare earth ores that would enable Japanese companies to make products.
The cutoff has caused hand-wringing at Japanese manufacturers, from giants like Toyota to tiny electronics makers, because the raw materials are crucial to products as diverse as hybrid electric cars, wind turbines and computer display screens.
Late last week, Japan's trade minister, Akihiro Ohata, said he would ask the government to include a ''rare earth strategy'' in its supplementary budget for this year.
In Kosaka, Dowa Holdings, the company that mined here for over a century, has built a recycling plant whose 200-foot-tall furnace renders old electronics parts into a molten stew from which valuable metals and other minerals can be extracted. The salvaged parts come from around Japan and overseas, including the United States.
Besides gold, Dowa's subsidiary, Kosaka Smelting and Refining, has so far successfully reclaimed rare metals like indium, used in liquid-crystal display screens, and antimony, used in silicon wafers for semiconductors.
The company is trying to develop ways to reclaim the harder-to-mine minerals included among the rare earths -- like neodymium, a vital element in industrial batteries used in electric motors, and dysprosium, used in laser materials.
Although Japan is poor in natural resources, the National Institute for Materials Science, a government-affiliated research group, says that used electronics in Japan hold an estimated 300,000 tons of rare earths. Though that amount is tiny compared to reserves in China, which mines 93 percent of the world's rare earth minerals, tapping these urban mines could help reduce Japan's dependence on its neighbor, analysts say.
The global rare earth market is small by mining standards -- just $1.5 billion last year, although its value is rising as prices have surged in response to Chinese restrictions on exports.
Concern over China's hoarding of rare earths has also been spreading to the United States. Although China has not specifically blocked shipments to any place but Japan, it had already tightened its overall export quotas of the minerals, announcing in July that it would reduce them by 72 percent for the rest of the year.
Last Wednesday in Washington, the House of Representatives approved a bill authorizing research to address the supply of rare earths, saying the minerals were critical to energy, military and manufacturing technologies.
Japanese companies generally avoid discussing their mineral holdings. But experts say that some manufacturers have been stockpiling rare earths, building inventories ranging from a few months' to a year's worth. Last Friday, Mr. Ohata, the trade minister, said the government was considering starting a stockpile of rare earths as a buffer against trade interruptions.
Heightened interest in alternative sources has also been an impetus to plans to reopen or establish new rare earth mines in a handful of countries around the world, including South Africa, Australia and Canada, along with the United States, where Molycorp intends to expand a mine in Mountain Pass, Calif. The Japanese trading company Sojitz is negotiating the rights to a rare earth mine in Vietnam, while the industrial conglomerate Sumitomo plans to work with Kazakhstan's government to recover rare earth elements from uranium ore residues.
Japan is also pushing for new manufacturing processes that do not require rare earths. Last week, the government-affiliated New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization, or N.E.D.O., announced that it had developed a motor for hybrid vehicles that used cheap and readily available ferrite magnets, instead of the rare earth magnets typically required.
Hitachi Metals, meanwhile, is working on a magnet that minimizes the use of rare earths by employing copper alloys.
''Japanese companies have become painfully aware of the risks of relying so greatly on China for strategic metals,'' said Akio Shibata, chief representative at the Marubeni Research Institute in Tokyo.
He said Japanese industry might benefit from researching alternatives to rare earths and developing recycling methods, noting how the oil shocks of the 1970s helped eventually make Japan a leader in fuel-efficiency technologies.
Various players have tried to recycle rare earths and metals in Japan. Last year, Hitachi began to experiment to extract rare earths from magnets in old computer hard drives, though the company said the project was not expected to go into operation until 2013.
But it is Dowa, the company that has mined in Kosaka since 1884, that has emerged as the field's early leader. And it could not come a moment too soon for this town of 6,000, which is littered with the remnants of its old ore mines: tunnels overgrown with weeds, old railroad tracks, and an abandoned bathhouse where miners once sponged off the grime from their long days underground.
The mines operated up to 1990, until a surging yen and international competition drove operations out of business. Now, portions of the old red-brick ore processing factories serve as part of Dowa's recycling plant, which started fully operating two years ago.
''It is important for Japan to actively tap its urban mines,'' said Kohmei Harada, a managing director at the National Institute of Materials Science, and an enthusiastic supporter of recycling efforts like the one in Kosaka. Apart from rare metals and earths, Mr. Harada estimates that about 6,800 tons of gold, or the equivalent of about 16 percent of the total reserves in the world's gold mines, lie in used electronics in Japan.
''Japan's economy has grown by gathering resources from around the world, and those resources are still with us, in one form or another,'' he said.
But this form of recycling is an expensive and technically difficult process that is still being perfected.
At Dowa's plant, computer chips and other vital parts from electronics are hacked into two-centimeter squares. This feedstock then must be smelted in a furnace that reaches 1,400 degrees Celsius before various minerals can be extracted. The factory processes 300 tons of materials a day, and each ton yields only about 150 grams of rare metals.
Though Dowa does not disclose the finances of its Kosaka recycling operations, the company says that after a year of operating at a low capacity, the factory now turns a profit. Over all, net income at Dowa Holdings, which deals in industrial metals and electronic materials, almost tripled in the quarter ending June 30, to 6.52 billion yen, or $78.2 million, as global industrial production rebounded.
As Dowa has turned its attention to rare earths, a priority is developing ways to render neodymium, which is used in powerful magnets. Its extraction has proved costly. Neodymium is found only in tiny quantities in parts used in the speakers of cellphones, for example, making it a challenge to collect meaningful amounts, said Utaro Sekiya, the manager of Dowa's recycling plant.
Finding enough electronics parts to recycle has also grown more difficult for Dowa, which procures used gadgets from around the world. A growing number of countries, including the United States, are recognizing the value of holding onto old electronics. And China already bans the export of used computer motherboards and other discarded electronics parts.
''It's about time Japan started paying more attention to recycling rare earths,'' Mr. Sekiya said. ''If we can become a leader in this field,'' he said, ''perhaps China will be the one coming to us to buy our technology.''

HEADLINE: Taking Revenge on 'Borat,' Amorous Donkey and All

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
ALMATY, Kazakhstan -- Sitting before some editing banks on the second floor of a nightclub here, a Kazakh director named Erkin Rakishev described the weighty task ahead: defending the honor of all Kazakhs by wreaking revenge on the odious movie ''Borat.''
Even now, four years after the film left the multiplexes, people here still bristle at Sacha Baron Cohen's portrayal of a buffoonish television reporter from Kazakhstan named Borat Sagdiyev, who has various misadventures in the United States and at home. The film was -- and still is -- considered an affront to the Kazakh national character. (Even its full name -- ''Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan'' -- was unflattering.) 
''I want to show modern Kazakhstan, as it is in reality,'' Mr. Rakishev said. ''After the original film, everyone around the world started mocking the Kazakh people. We were made to look crazy, wild, barbarous. It was not the truth.''
Mr. Rakishev was certainly right. Kazakhstan, a vast former Soviet republic in Central Asia with a vibrant economy driven by oil and other natural resources, bears almost no resemblance to the place caricatured in Mr. Baron Cohen's film.
So, would Mr. Rakishev's retort be a documentary that extolled prosperous Kazakh cities like Almaty, the commercial capital, with its megamalls, coffee bars and boutiques selling the latest Parisian labels? Would it be a polemic that denounced Western imperialism for using cinema to undermine emerging nations like Kazakhstan?
Not exactly. Coming soon to theaters near you (all right, mostly Kazakh ones): ''My Brother, Borat,'' a film that seeks to portray today's Kazakhstan with some curious narrative devices. Like an amorous donkey. Which somehow has its way with Borat's loopy brother. Who then gets pregnant. And the two get married.
Remind us again how this is supposed to improve the image of Kazakhstan?
''It's a black comedy,'' Mr. Rakishev said. ''If we do a comedy for the Kazakh people, in the West, they may not understand it. In Kazakhstan, they understand a donkey.''
He screened footage that he had already shot. A half-naked man with a flamboyant mustache raced through the streets, arms flailing. A demented grandmother pummeled some cringing adversaries. Many awkward cross-cultural encounters.
It all seemed a bit familiar. Was the film a Kazakh riposte to ''Borat'' -- or a homage?
''Yes, we want to show modern Kazakhstan, but if we do it in a boring way, no one is going to be interested in it,'' Mr. Rakishev said.
In the plot, an American named John enjoys the original movie and decides that he must visit Kazakhstan itself to see this bizarre land with his own eyes. But when he arrives, he discovers that Kazakhstan is (surprise!) a wonderful country.
John is puzzled and seeks some help tracking down Borat himself from Borat's brother, Bilo, who is mentioned in the original film. Bilo now happens to be in a psychiatric hospital in Kazakhstan, along with patients who think that they are George W. Bush and Osama bin Laden.
Bilo escapes from the hospital with John, is bitten by a rabid dog, turns feral, gets beaten up by the grandmother and has his encounter with the donkey. The protagonists scheme to buy the Statue of Liberty and move it to Kazakhstan. And so on.
Mr. Rakishev did not explain exactly how all this was intended to reflect positively on his homeland. But it was evident that he was pleased with the script -- so much so that while recounting various scenes, he burst into teary-eyed laughter and the interview had to be halted temporarily.
He would not, however, give away all the twists. For example, John also gets pregnant. By whom? ''I am not telling you!'' Mr. Rakishev declared before his words were lost in high-pitched giggles.
The film is being shot in Russian -- which, along with Kazakh, is one of the nation's two main languages. Classically trained actors from Almaty's top dramatic theater have the roles of John and Bilo.
Roman Khikalov, who plays John, acknowledged that the film had some lowbrow moments, but he maintained that it did provide a glimpse of Kazakhstan itself.
''It's very visual,'' Mr. Khikalov said. ''We show the modern city, the mountains, the beauty of the country.''
Mr. Rakishev said he started working on the film after ''Borat'' was released in 2006, but abandoned it because of a lack of financing. He said he was able to resume production only recently.
He also said he would not mind distributing the film in the United States, though there was the matter of possible copyright violation.
''If they want to sue me, fine,'' he said. ''But they will have no right to. Who gave them the right to humiliate our nation? I am ready to stick up for my nation before any judge.''
Whether Mr. Baron Cohen would take offense -- or head to the courts -- could not be ascertained. A spokesman for the actor said he would not comment.
While the Kazakh government was highly annoyed by the original ''Borat'' and effectively banned it from the theaters, Mr. Rakishev said officials were not supporting his venture, financially or otherwise. He said they seemed to prefer to never again have to hear the word ''Borat.''
Even so, Mr. Rakishev was plowing ahead. He said the end of ''My Brother, Borat'' would reveal to the world what everyone should have known about the original film: that it was shot in Romania, and that Mr. Baron Cohen was not Kazakh, but British.
Still, it was hard to shake the sense that Mr. Rakishev admired Mr. Baron Cohen's talents. But when pressed, he would not say anything positive about the ''Borat'' movie.
Mr. Khikalov was not as reluctant.
''The truth,'' he said, ''is that I laughed a lot.''

HEADLINE: Removing Blocks To City Bailouts

BYLINE: By MARTIN HUTCHINSON and JEFFREY GOLDFARB

 BODY:
President Gerald Ford refused to help New York in 1975, a rejection immortalized in the headline ''drop dead.''
Historically, the federal government hasn't bailed out states and cities facing default. But the European Union's rescue of Greece and the exceptional depth of the recent recession just might change that. Two possible structures for bailouts are budget-avoiding federal guarantees and regulation-bending Federal Reserve bond purchases. Either way, politics may make rescues hard to resist.
Any such action would create huge controversy over constitutional principles of state sovereignty and responsibility. It would also create a potentially hazardous precedent. But that doesn't make it impossible. 
Sure, major direct transfers of cash to states or municipalities, beyond those in the 2009 stimulus package, would worsen federal finances and are thus unlikely. But federal guarantees of local debts would not immediately increase federal budget shortfalls. In fact, limited guarantees for nonfederal infrastructure projects were considered as part of last year's stimulus. A narrowly defined guarantee program that extended to all states, but mostly helped a few, might avoid the political problems of directly bailing out just one state.
An alternative mechanism could be an extension of the Fed's asset purchases to include state and municipal bonds. Currently the central bank does not have the power to do this for maturities longer than six months.
But an approving Congress could remove that hurdle at a stroke, at least temporarily. That would distance the problem further from the federal budget, burying the risk in the Fed's balance sheet -- though of course it would amount to another form of money printing, as is the case with the Fed's existing programs to buy Treasuries and mortgage bonds.
In the end, whether decades of history are overturned may depend on the breadth of state and local financial problems. A guarantee or Fed purchase program to tackle a widespread danger of default could garner political support. Conversely, if default appeared confined to one large entity like California -- as was the case with New York in 1975 -- the politics would probably prevent any rescue. If troubled state and municipal governments are hoping that they and their bond investors will get federal help, there is probably safety in numbers.
TPG Goes Hollywood
TPG's investment in a $5 billion buyout of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 2004 turned out to be a turkey. The film studio's owners are now on the verge of getting wiped out. But that isn't stopping TPG from testing the shark-filled waters of Hollywood again.
The private equity firm said it would buy a 35 percent stake in Creative Artists Agency, the talent firm best known for representing stars like George Clooney and Julia Roberts.
At least TPG seems to be wading in to a depressed market. Studios have struggled to rustle up financing for movies, meaning fewer of them get made, actors earn less and, consequently, fees tumble for agents. Digital distribution is causing an uproar.
The upheaval has spread across the industry. William Morris and Endeavor, C.A.A.'s rivals, cobbled together a messy merger last year. That predictably prompted some valuable employees to flee. TPG seems to have tried to prevent a similar exodus at C.A.A. by locking in senior agents for five years while allowing them to cash out part of their stakes in the firm.
The upshot is that for its noncontrolling stake in C.A.A., TPG is paying about $165 million and arranging for $200 million of debt, giving the agency a valuation of around $700 million. It is also pledging cash for a jointly financed $500 million pot for future deals.
C.A.A. needed the new capital to expand. It wisely diversified into the sports business a few years ago and now represents more than 650 athletes, including the Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter. The announcement from C.A.A. and TPG didn't even mention its Hollywood clients. But the sports arm, however promising, is expensive because of upfront payouts.
TPG may be able to help in other areas, too. International expansion and the agency's fledgling investment banking arm will help further diversify the agency. Still, it's difficult to see a clear path to a profitable exit for TPG in a sector where people matter more than financial engineering.
What is more, no matter how hard TPG may try to separate C.A.A. from the film and TV industries, they remain a cornerstone of the agency's business. And outsiders who swim with the sector's sharks all too often get eaten.

HEADLINE: Crash Brings Traffic to Halt on Busy Texas Waterway

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY

 BODY:
HOUSTON -- Oil tankers and cargo ships were lining up in the waters outside the Houston Ship Channel on Monday, as crews with a floating crane worked furiously to repair a damaged 300-foot-tall electrical tower that was blocking entry to one of the country's largest ports, the Coast Guard said. 
At 6 a.m. Sunday, a tug boat pushing three barges loaded with scrap metal went off course and crashed into the base of the metal tower, which sits on an island in the center of the channel near where it empties into Galveston Bay, Petty Officer Richard Brahm said.
The first barge cut through part of the tower's base. The tower listed wildly to one side and ended up resting on the barge, its high-voltage lines sagging dangerously close to the water. The channel was effectively cut off to traffic.
CenterPoint Energy, which owns the power lines, brought in a giant crane on another barge Monday. Crews of workmen were trying to hoist the wrecked tower up with the floating crane, known as Big John. The job may not be completed until late Tuesday, the company said.
Thirty to 40 vessels use the channel daily to reach dozens of terminals at refineries, railheads and shipping companies that line the 25-mile-long waterway. The Coast Guard estimates that the channel handles about $322 million a day in freight. By late Monday afternoon, 19 ships were anchored outside the port, waiting for it to open, and at least 12 ships were trapped at piers.
Still, it will be at least three days before the accident begins to take a economic toll, port officials said. Most of the refineries have at least a three-day supply of gasoline and distillates, because it is not uncommon for the channel to be closed for 48 hours due to bad weather or heavy fog. Pilots in the bay are well drilled on shepherding a backlog of ships into port once the closings are over.
''Right now, we don't expect anything to be lost,'' said Patrick Seeba, a project manager with the Greater Houston Port Bureau, a trade group. ''It's like sitting in traffic on the way to the grocery and you decide to turn around and go back tomorrow. You are still going to go to the grocery store.''
Large refineries owned by Valero Energy, Royal Dutch Shell, Pasadena Refining System and other companies could be affected by a long delay.
Mr. Seeba said the ships affected so far were carrying bulk loads, like grain, cement and steel, as well as oil. Much of the traffic in shipping containers was unhindered, since the biggest facilities for unloading containers are on Galveston Bay.
The cause of the accident is under investigation, Petty Officer Brahm said. The captain of the tug boat, the Safety Quest, has been interviewed and tested for drugs and alcohol.

HEADLINE: Criticism Flies After State Eases Ban on Art Sales

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
When the New York State Board of Regents met last month to consider making permanent a set of temporary regulations that bar the sale of artwork by museums to cover expenses, approval was widely considered a fait accompli.
The Regents staff members supported such a move, and public officials and museum professionals concerned about such sales, known as deaccessioning, had anticipated that permanent protections would now be on the books.
Instead the Regents voted on Sept. 14 to let the regulations expire, which they will on Friday.
The board said it needed more time to address the conflicting viewpoints of many museums, large and small. But the turnaround and the resulting reduction in oversight have drawn sharp rebukes from museum executives, legislators and even one of the Regents, who have characterized the board's behavior as abrupt and secretive. 
''I'm flabbergasted,'' said Matthew Titone, a Democratic assemblyman who represents Staten Island. ''They've jeopardized the public's trust. I don't think there's any viable explanation.''
In a letter dated Sept. 21 that was sent to Merryl H. Tisch, the chancellor of the Board of Regents, the Museum Association of New York, which represents some 360 cultural groups and individuals in the state, said it was stunned by the decision.
In an interview Dr. Tisch acknowledged that the process could have been better handled. But she said making the regulations permanent would have been precipitous, as so many major cultural organizations were opposed.
''This was our attempt to go back to ground zero and see if we can configure a solution that works across a broad spectrum of disparate types of institutions,'' she said. ''There is no consensus about where to go here.''
Several larger institutions, like the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, wrote directly to Dr. Tisch in the days before the vote. ''If made permanent,'' Glenn Lowry, the director of MoMA wrote on Sept. 9, ''this rule would remove from Regents-governed institutions the curatorial discretion that has made them among the most respected in the world.''
The debate around deaccessioning has been building since 2008, when Fort Ticonderoga proposed selling some of its artifacts to plug a shortfall, an idea it later abandoned. In response the Regents, who oversee museums in the state because most of them are chartered as educational institutions, adopted a set of emergency regulations barring the sale of artwork to cover costs.
A year later, Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester Democrat, drafted state legislation with the help of the Regents and the Museum Association to make such sales illegal. But the bill died in the face of opposition from larger institutions like the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
Such museums say they are sufficiently self-regulated and do not want government dictating their collection policies. But many small organizations who have been buffeted by the economic downturn worry about pressure from their boards to sell artworks to pay the bills. These organizations crave official boundaries to protect their collections.
''Whatever concerns the larger institutions had seemed to have a very substantial impact,'' said Michael Botwinick, director of the Hudson River Museum in Yonkers, who serves on the board of the Museum Association and said he felt ''blindsided'' by the Regents' decision. ''Their concerns certainly seemed to prevail.''
Several members of Dr. Tisch's extended family have been associated as donors or trustees with some of the major museums that objected to the regulations. There are Tisch Galleries at the Metropolitan Museum, for example, named for her father-in-law, Laurence, and his brother, Preston. And Dr. Tisch and her husband, James S. Tisch, the chief executive of the Loews Corporation, have given through their foundation to MoMA and the Whitney, as well as to smaller cultural organizations.
But Dr. Tisch, who told the board prior to its vote that she opposed making the regulations permanent, said her family's associations played no role in her decision. ''One thing about a large family, everyone really has their own interests,'' she said. ''If you're asking whether anyone in my family lobbied me on behalf of any of these institutions, the answer to that is, I promise you, no.''
As to whether the vote represented the triumph of powerful Manhattan interests over smaller upstate institutions that favored the regulations, Dr. Tisch said, ''That's not who I am, not how I think about things.''
''When the cultural institutions were telling me we were hurting their ability to curate their collections, that's not an irrelevant concern,'' she said. ''Why would I ignore that?''
The day before the full vote the Regents' five-member Committee on Cultural Education voted 3 to 0 with two abstentions ''to postpone indefinitely'' any deaccessioning policy, a recommendation that was forwarded to the full board. One member who abstained, James C. Dawson, an outspoken advocate of deaccessioning regulation, said that as the former chairman of the committee, he was surprised by the decision. He had believed sentiments on the panel ran the other way, he said.
After the full board's vote the Regents announced plans for an advisory group to explore how best to address the issue. On Friday Dr. Tisch met with Mr. Brodsky and other officials, after which the Regents issued a statement that said they remain committed to working further on a permanent regulation.
''I believe the product we end up with is going to be appropriate, transparent and negotiated with people at the table who will be impacted by what we do,'' Dr. Tisch said in an interview, ''and that to me is the best way to create public policy.''
In the absence of the regulations the Regents policy will revert back to a set of guidelines on the books since 1971 and amended in 1998 to address collections management, including deaccessioning. While the guidelines prohibit the use of proceeds from art sales for operating expenses, they also require that such sales be consistent with an institution's ''corporate purposes and mission statement.''
This leaves open the possibility, critics said, that museums could amend their mission statements to suit their deaccessioning interests or argue that selling artworks fit within their ''corporate purposes.''
There is no sense that any institution plans to sell off works when the regulations expire, but several officials said the danger is real. ''The Regents have now given a blueprint for avoidance of a bedrock principle of museum operation,'' Mr. Brodsky wrote in a Sept. 20 letter to Dr. Tisch. ''The monetization of collections is now legal. The public trust doctrine has been eroded. New York has lost its position as a leading protector of the public interest in the museum world.''
On Monday, though, Mr. Brodsky characterized the meeting Friday with Dr. Tisch as promising. ''I was very encouraged,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Candidates for Comptroller Spar Over Ties to Wall Street

BYLINE: By SAM DOLNICK

 BODY:
Thomas P. DiNapoli, the New York State comptroller, spent much of his first debate with the Republican challenger, Harry Wilson, denouncing Mr. Wilson as ''a wizard of Wall Street'' who could not be trusted to manage the public pension fund or end the corruption that has plagued the office.
Mr. Wilson, a former hedge fund manager who has never before run for office, struck back by attacking Mr. DiNapoli, a veteran legislator, as a ''creature of Albany'' unqualified to function as the state's chief financial officer. 
''I have a relatively novel idea that the comptroller should actually have actual investment experience,'' Mr. Wilson said.
Mr. Wilson, who veered between prosecutorial and stilted, appeared nervous through much of the debate. He rushed through several answers, swallowed between sentences, and at times resorted to rehearsed talking points.
Mr. DiNapoli was aggressive from the start, derisively referring to Mr. Wilson's Wall Street career in nearly every answer.
''You were a part of that great wizardry on Wall Street that hurt people,'' he said. ''Those are not the values we want to see in the comptroller's office.''
At times, Mr. Wilson seemed younger than his 38 years, especially when he responded to another of Mr. DiNapoli's comments that he ''comes from a very different world'' that did not share ''middle-class values.''
''Why don't you talk to my parents?'' Mr. Wilson said. ''I didn't grow up on Wall Street. I grew up in Johnstown, N.Y.''
Although the race has failed to capture the public's attention, the first debate featured a lively back-and-forth that touched on ''Mad Men,'' the Mets and the ''poking'' feature on Facebook. (Mr. DiNapoli ''infrequently'' pokes people, while Mr. Wilson said he had never poked anyone.)
The comptroller's main responsibilities include overseeing the state's $124.8 billion pension fund, and auditing the spending of government agencies.
After more than two decades representing Nassau County in the Assembly, Mr. DiNapoli was tapped in 2007 by fellow legislators to succeed Alan G. Hevesi as comptroller after he resigned amid a corruption scandal.
Mr. Wilson sought to discredit his opponent for being ''appointed'' to the office by asking him how many voters selected him to be comptroller.
''A lot,'' Mr. DiNapoli retorted, ''and they'll be voting for me on Nov. 2.''
Although much of the debate centered on accounting practices and tax loopholes, the candidates displayed passion at times, most notably when they addressed each other directly.
Mr. Wilson asked his opponent why voters should elect him when he ''had not a single ounce of financial experience'' and was ''deemed unqualified by a governor of your own party,'' a reference to then-Gov. Eliot Spitzer's initial reaction to Mr. DiNapoli's selection.
Mr. DiNapoli, his expression tightening, responded, ''When people even in your own party, especially governors, criticize you, it shows as comptroller you're doing the job.''
''I wear that as a badge of honor,'' he added.
Mr. Wilson worked at Goldman Sachs, Blackstone and Silver Point Capital, a high-profile hedge fund, before beginning his first political campaign. He has sought to use his financial experience to his advantage, but he spent much of the night fending off Mr. DiNapoli's barbs about his ''cronies on Wall Street'' and Silver Point's investment in the subprime mortgage sector.
''Mr. DiNapoli spends all his time talking about how I and my friends wrecked the economy,'' Mr. Wilson said. ''I had no idea how powerful I was. He's just trying to basically hurt me through guilt by association.''
During the financial crisis, Mr. Wilson was the only Republican to join President Obama's automotive industry task force, playing a leading role in restructuring General Motors. He sought to draw a parallel between G.M. and New York's economy, saying, ''I think that's what New York State needs: a turn around led by a professional, not a politician.''
Mr. DiNapoli has been leading in most polls, though one showed that most voters had not formed an opinion about either man.
Mr. Wilson had the financial advantage going into the final month. His campaign had $2.6 million on hand, compared with $1.4 million for Mr. DiNapoli, according to disclosure reports filed last week. Since January, Mr. Wilson has lent his campaign at least $2.75 million, but he has declined to say how much of his own money he would spend in all.
The debate on Monday, which was co-sponsored by NY1 and Citizens Union and held at Pace University, was the only one scheduled so far, but the Wilson campaign has pressed for more.
To prepare for the debate, Mr. Wilson's campaign brought a lectern to his home in Scarsdale, but his four young daughters monopolized it all weekend with speeches of their own, aides said.
Mr. DiNapoli cast a consultant from AKPD Message and Media, a well-known firm, to play Mr. Wilson during rehearsals.
For his closing argument, Mr. DiNapoli looked square at the camera and seemed to relish the put-downs, saying that Mr. Wilson ''one of the Don Juans of Wall Street, did very, very well.''
''Now,'' Mr. DiNapoli said, ''he preaches like he's St. Francis of Assisi in how he's going to save the state.''

HEADLINE: STEM Education Has Little to Do With Flowers

BYLINE: By NATALIE ANGIER

 BODY:
If you want to talk about bolstering science and math education in this country, I'll gladly break out my virtual pompoms and go rah. Who wouldn't? Our nation's economy, global allure and future tense all depend on the strength of its scientific spine.
But mention the odious and increasingly pervasive term ''STEM education,'' and instead of cheerleading gear, I reach for my ... pistil. In my disgruntlement, I am not alone.
For readers who heretofore have been spared exposure to this little concatenation of capital letters, or who have, quite understandably, misconstrued its meaning, STEM stands for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics, supposedly the major food groups of a comprehensive science education. 
Aficionados pronounce STEM exactly as you'd imagine -- like the plant part, like the cell type, like what you do to a tide and I wish I could do to this trend, but it's probably too late. Go to any convention, Congressional hearing or science foundation bagel chat on the ever ominous theme of ''Science in the Classroom, and why can't our students be more like Singapore's when they take international tests anyway?'' and you'll hear little about how to teach trigonometry or afford all those Popsicle sticks needed for the eighth-grade bridge-building competition, but you'll be pelted by references to STEM.
A new report from the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology offers many worthy ideas for improving science education, like creating a ''master corps'' of the nation's finest science teachers who would in turn train others; but the STEM word keeps thudding up its pages like so many gristle nubs in a turkey burger. It's greasy-peasy: collapse down education, and you've got a buzz phrase to rival phys ed.
As even those who use the term admit, it is deeply, serio-comically flawed. For starters, it is opaque and confusing. ''Everybody who knows what it means knows what it means, and everybody else doesn't,'' said Eric Lander, co-chairman of the president's advisory council and head of the Broad Institute of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University. When he first heard the term, he figured it was a too-cute reference to botany. ''I thought, stem education? What about flower education?'' he said.
These days, given the public's fixation on embryonic stem cells -- progenitor cells that give rise to all the different tissues of the body -- the potential for confusion is even worse. ''People hear about STEM education, and they think some harm has come to an embryo in the process,'' Dr. Lander said.
The term also sounds didactic and jargony, which is why Sally Ride, the former astronaut who now travels the country promoting the glories of science education to girls and other interested parties, said she consciously avoids it.
''With my NASA heritage, I'm perfectly capable of speaking entirely in acronyms, including the verbs,'' she said. ''But this is not very helpful when talking to the public.''
Dr. Ride's instincts are well grounded. According to survey results released last month by the nonprofit group Entertainment Industries Council, when some 5,000 participants were asked whether they understood the term ''STEM education,'' 86 percent said no. ''They said it made them think of stem cells, branches, leaves and broccoli stems,'' said Brian Dyak, the group's president. ''I have no clue on that last one.'' Clearly, he added, ''we have a branding issue here.''
But is it a brand worth pitching? Some critics argue that the term is unnecessary and potentially self-defeating. What's wrong with a simple science education, or if need be, science and math education? What's with all the discipline call-outs that demanded the invention of an acronym?
''A program officer from a foundation recently asked me, 'Is the work you're doing STEM education or science education?' '' said Elizabeth Stage, the director of the Lawrence Hall of Science at the University of California, Berkeley. ''I drew him a Venn diagram, showing him what's central about science and how that overlaps with technology, engineering and math.''
Dr. Stage, a mathematician by training, thinks it's a ''false distinction'' to ''silo out'' the different disciplines, and would much prefer to focus on what the fields have in common, like problem-solving, arguing from evidence and reconciling conflicting views. ''That's what we should have in the bulls'-eye of our target,'' she said.
The decision to include engineering and technology in the education ''messaging'' dates roughly to the 1990s, when the National Science Foundation and other government agencies began trying to draw up national standards for science education, specifying what students in kindergarten through 12th grade should know by the end of every school year.
''I remember it being made explicit that science encompassed more than straight-up science, and you started hearing requests to include mention of math, technology and engineering,'' Dr. Stage said.
Pragmatism and economics are also part of the equation. As government has turned ever more avidly to industry to help pay for expensive improvements in the science classroom, the need to emphasize the link between a well-rounded science education and tomorrow's techie work force has grown accordingly. ''A lot of corporations are now talking to each other about what they're doing in STEM education,'' said Dr. Stage, and those corporations include engineering and computer heavyweights like Exxon Mobil, Intel and Hewlett-Packard.
Dr. Lander argues that that there is a basic rightness to the itemizing spirit behind STEM. ''Science is discovering the laws of the natural world, and mathematics isn't that, it's logical, deductive truth, and its experiments don't have error bars,'' he said. ''And when you get to technology and engineering, it's the constructed world, and that's different than the discovered one.'' He'd like a better term than the current one, but said he's tried ''all four factorial permutations'' of the letters, and the alternatives are either unpronounceable or already claimed by a baseball team. Dr. Ride points out that an earlier version of the official acronym was, in fact, SMET, ''and thankfully we've moved away from that,'' she said.
Yet others don't frame the word ''science'' so narrowly, as the province of the given rather than of the forged. Science has always encompassed the applied and the basic, and the impulses to explore and to invent have always been linked. Galileo built a telescope and then trained it on the sky. Advances in technology illuminate realms beyond our born senses, and those insights in turn yield better scientific toys. Engineers use math and physics and the scientific mind-set in everything they design; and those who don't, please let us know, so we can fly someone else's airplane and not cross your bridge when we come to it. Whatever happened to the need for interdisciplinary thinking? Why promote a brand that codifies atomization?
Besides, acronyms encourage rampant me-tooism. Mr. Dyak said that some have lobbied for the addition of medicine to the scholastic program, complete with a second M. ''It's called STEM squared,'' he said. Even the arts are hankering for an orthographic position, he added.
STEAM education: great books, labs and motherboards, and free rug cleaning, too.

HEADLINE: Military Orders Less Dependence On Fossil Fuels

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
With insurgents increasingly attacking the American fuel supply convoys that lumber across the Khyber Pass into Afghanistan, the military is pushing aggressively to develop, test and deploy renewable energy to decrease its need to transport fossil fuels.
Last week, a Marine company from California arrived in the rugged outback of Helmand Province bearing novel equipment: portable solar panels that fold up into boxes; energy-conserving lights; solar tent shields that provide shade and electricity; solar chargers for computers and communications equipment.
The 150 Marines of Company I, Third Battalion, Fifth Marines, will be the first to take renewable technology into a battle zone, where the new equipment will replace diesel and kerosene-based fuels that would ordinarily generate power to run their encampment. 
Even as Congress has struggled unsuccessfully to pass an energy bill and many states have put renewable energy on hold because of the recession, the military this year has pushed rapidly forward. After a decade of waging wars in remote corners of the globe where fuel is not readily available, senior commanders have come to see overdependence on fossil fuel as a big liability, and renewable technologies -- which have become more reliable and less expensive over the past few years -- as providing a potential answer. These new types of renewable energy now account for only a small percentage of the power used by the armed forces, but military leaders plan to rapidly expand their use over the next decade.
In Iraq and Afghanistan, the huge truck convoys that haul fuel to bases have been sitting ducks for enemy fighters -- in the latest attack, oil tankers carrying fuel for NATO troops in Afghanistan were set on fire in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, early Monday. In Iraq and Afghanistan, one Army study found, for every 24 fuel convoys that set out, one soldier or civilian engaged in fuel transport was killed. In the past three months, six Marines have been wounded guarding fuel runs in Afghanistan.
''There are a lot of profound reasons for doing this, but for us at the core it's practical,'' said Ray Mabus, the Navy secretary and a former ambassador to Saudi Arabia, who has said he wants 50 percent of the power for the Navy and Marines to come from renewable energy sources by 2020. That figure includes energy for bases as well as fuel for cars and ships.
''Fossil fuel is the No. 1 thing we import to Afghanistan,'' Mr. Mabus said, ''and guarding that fuel is keeping the troops from doing what they were sent there to do, to fight or engage local people.''
He and other experts also said that greater reliance on renewable energy improved national security, because fossil fuels often came from unstable regions and scarce supplies were a potential source of international conflict.
Fossil fuel accounts for 30 to 80 percent of the load in convoys into Afghanistan, bringing costs as well as risk. While the military buys gas for just over $1 a gallon, getting that gallon to some forward operating bases costs $400.
''We had a couple of tenuous supply lines across Pakistan that are costing us a heck of a lot, and they're very dangerous,'' said Gen. James T. Conway, the commandant of the Marine Corps.
Col. Robert Charette Jr., director of the Marine Corps Expeditionary Energy Office, said he was ''cautiously optimistic'' that Company I's equipment would prove reliable and durable enough for military use, and that other Marine companies would be adopting renewable technology in the coming months, although there would probably always be a need to import fuel for some purposes.
While setting national energy policy requires Congressional debates, military leaders can simply order the adoption of renewable energy. And the military has the buying power to create products and markets. That, in turn, may make renewable energy more practical and affordable for everyday uses, experts say.
Last year, the Navy introduced its first hybrid vessel, a Wasp class amphibious assault ship called the U.S.S. Makin Island, which at speeds under 10 knots runs on electricity rather than on fossil fuel, a shift resulting in greater efficiency that saved 900,000 gallons of fuel on its maiden voyage from Mississippi to San Diego, compared with a conventional ship its size, the Navy said.
The Air Force will have its entire fleet certified to fly on biofuels by 2011 and has already flown test flights using a 50-50 mix of plant-based biofuel and jet fuel; the Navy took its first delivery of fuel made from algae this summer. Biofuels can in theory be produced wherever the raw materials, like plants, are available, and could ultimately be made near battlefields.
Concerns about the military's dependence on fossil fuels in far-flung battlefields began in 2006 in Iraq, where Richard Zilmer, then a major general and the top American commander in western Iraq, sent an urgent cable to Washington suggesting that renewable technology could prevent loss of life. That request catalyzed new research, but the pressure for immediate results magnified as the military shifted its focus to Afghanistan, a country with little available native fossil fuel and scarce electricity outside cities.
Fuel destined for American troops in landlocked Afghanistan is shipped to Karachi, Pakistan, where it is loaded on convoys of 50 to 70 vehicles for transport to central bases. Smaller convoys branch out to the forward lines. The Marines' new goal is to make the more peripheral sites sustain themselves with the kind of renewable technology carried by Company I, since solar electricity can be generated right on the battlefield.
There are similar tactical advantages to using renewable fuel for planes and building hybrid ships. ''Every time you cut a ship away from the need to visit an oiler -- a fuel supply ship -- you create an advantage,'' said Mr. Mabus, noting that the Navy had pioneered previous energy transformations in the United States, from sail power to coal power in the 19th century, as well as from coal to oil and oil to nuclear power in the 20th century.
The cost calculation is also favorable. The renewable technology that will power Company I costs about $50,000 to $70,000; a single diesel generator costs several thousand dollars. But when it costs hundreds of dollars to get each gallon of traditional fuel to base camps in Afghanistan, the investment is quickly defrayed.
Because the military has moved into renewable energy so rapidly, much of the technology currently being used is commercially available or has been adapted for the battlefield from readily available civilian models.
This spring, the military invited commercial manufacturers to demonstrate products that might be useful on the battlefield. A small number were selected for further testing. The goal was to see, for example, if cooling systems could handle the 120 degree temperatures often seen in current war zones or if embedded solar panels would make tents more visible to enemy radar.
This summer, renewable technologies proved capable of powering computers, residences and most equipment for more than a week at a test base in the Mojave Desert -- though not enough to operate the most sophisticated surveillance systems.
Much more is in the testing stages: one experimental cooling system uses a pipe burrowed into the cool earth eight feet underground that vents into tents; a solar fan on the tent roof evacuates the hot air and draws cool air from underground. The Marines are exploring solar-powered water purification systems and looking into the possibility of building a small-scale, truck-based biofuel plant that could transform local crops -- like illegal poppies -- into fuel.
''If the Navy comes knocking, they will build it,'' Mr. Mabus said. ''The price will come down and the infrastructure will be created.''

HEADLINE: Elections Pose Obstacle to Rail Expansion

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
Republicans running for governor in a handful of states could block, or significantly delay, one of President Obama's signature initiatives: his plan to expand the passenger rail system and to develop the nation's first bullet-train service.
In his State of the Union address this year, the president called for building high-speed rail, and backed up his words with $8 billion in stimulus money, distributed to various states, for rail projects.
But Republican candidates for governor in some of the states that won the biggest stimulus rail awards are reaching for the emergency brake.
In Wisconsin, which got more than $810 million in federal stimulus money to build a train linebetween Milwaukee and Madison, Scott Walker, the Milwaukee County executive and Republican candidate for governor, has made his opposition to the project central to his campaign. 
Mr. Walker, who worries that the state could be required to spend $7 million to $10 million a year to operate the trains once the line is built, started a Web site, NoTrain.com, and has run a television advertisement in which he calls the rail project a boondoggle. ''I'm Scott Walker,'' he says in the advertisement, ''and if I'm elected as your next governor, we'll stop this train.''
Similar concerns are threatening to stall many of the nation's biggest train projects. In Ohio, the Republican candidate for governor, John Kasich, is vowing to kill a $400 million federal stimulus project to link Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati by rail. In Florida, Rick Scott, the Republican candidate for governor, has questioned whether the state should invest in the planned rail line from Orlando to Tampa. The state got $1.25 billion in federal stimulus money for the project, but it will cost at least twice that much to complete.
And the nation's most ambitious high-speed rail project, California's $45 billion plan to link Los Angeles and San Francisco with trains that would go up to 220 miles per hour, could be delayed if Meg Whitman, a Republican, is elected governor. ''In the face of the state's current fiscal crisis, Meg doesn't believe we can afford the costs associated with new high-speed rail at this time,'' said Tucker Bounds, a campaign spokesman.
Ms. Whitman's desire to delay the project, which has already received $2.25 billion in stimulus money, drew a rebuke from the administration of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican who champions high-speed rail. ''To say 'now is not the time' shows a very narrow vision,'' said Matt David, the governor's communications director.
The state-level opposition is a reminder of the challenge of building a national transportation project in the United States: while the federal government can set priorities, the construction is up to the states.
With recent polls showing all of the anti-rail Republican candidates leading or within striking distance of their pro-rail Democratic rivals, it is possible they could be elected and try to stop the train projects.
Federal officials, meanwhile, are incredulous that candidates are threatening to spurn stimulus money that their states competed ferociously to win just a year ago.
''The bottom line is that high-speed rail is a national program that will connect the country, spur economic development and bring manufacturing jobs to the U.S.,'' Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, a former Republican congressman, said in a statement. ''It will also transform transportation in America, much like the Interstate highway system did under President Eisenhower. It's hard to imagine what would have happened to states like Ohio and Wisconsin if their leaders had decided they didn't want to be connected to the rest of the country back then.''
Several candidates said they wanted to spend the stimulus rail money on roads and bridges, but it is unlikely they would be able to do so without changing the law: the stimulus, which included $28 billion for roads and bridges, required that the $8 billion for rail projects be spent on rail projects.
Federal officials declined to speculate on what would happen if anti-rail candidates were to win. But states that turn down rail money would probably have to return it to the federal government, which could then award it to states that want it.
Building a real high-speed rail network, like the ones expanding in Europe and Asia, is costly. The Acela trains between Boston and Washington can reach 150 m.p.h., but average around half that on their curvy, busy tracks.
That corridor, the most heavily used in the country, was largely shut out of the stimulus money; last week Amtrak outlined a $117 billion proposal to make it a true high-speed line.
The Obama administration used the rail stimulus money to make down payments on the high-speed lines in Florida and California and to build conventional rail service in other states.
The administration's hope is that these rail lines will develop into networks that connect more cities, and that future investment can speed the trains. But critics question who will ride the new, not very fast trains.
The train proposed in Ohio would reach only 79 m.p.h. Estimates have suggested that some trips, with stops factored in, could average 39 m.p.h. Federal officials say the trains would be faster, but the number has stuck: in a recent debate Mr. Kasich, the Republican candidate, vowed that if he is elected governor, ''the 39 mile-an-hour high-speed passenger train is dead.''
Gov. Ted Strickland, a Democrat seeking re-election, looked flabbergasted that anyone would turn down a $400 million construction project, fully financed by the federal government, to link the state's biggest cities. ''Your position, quite frankly, really puzzles me,'' he responded at the debate.
Mr. Walker, the candidate in Wisconsin, said in an interview that he doubted many people would ride the train between Milwaukee and Madison. He said that it would be more expensive than a car trip without saving much time, and added that he worried about having to provide an annual subsidy to run the train.
In Florida, Bettina Inclan, a spokeswoman for Mr. Scott, the Republican candidate, noted that the state already paid to operate a commuter rail system and added that ''we cannot afford to be subsidizing the bullet train as well.''
All Republicans are not against trains. One prominent rail advocate, John Robert Smith, was a four-term Republican mayor of Meridian, Miss.
''Any notion that somehow rail is subsidized, and other modes of transportation aren't, is simply not factual,'' said Mr. Smith, the president Reconnecting America, a nonprofit transportation advocacy group, who noted that highways and airports were subsidized as well. ''Honestly, transportation infrastructure should not be a partisan issue. When you talk about good transportation solutions, they cross party lines.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Factory Orders Fell, but Home Sales Rose in August

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of people who signed contracts to buy homes rose in August for a second month, but remained far below last year's pace. The weak economy and fears that prices will fall are keeping many consumers away from the housing market.
The National Association of Realtors said that its seasonally adjusted index of sales agreements for previously occupied homes rose 4.3 percent to a reading of 82.3 points. That is still more than 20 percent below the pace in the same month a year earlier. 
Economists surveyed by Thomson Reuters had expected the index to rise to 81.4 points.
The index provides an early measurement of housing sales activity because there is usually a one- to two-month lag between a sales contract and a completed deal.
A reading of 100 indicates the average level of sales activity in 2001, when the index started. The reading was above that threshold from March 2003 through April 2007. It sank during the recession, only to surge above 100 a year ago when the government first offered tax incentives to spur sales. When the credits expired in April, the index sank.
''With underlying economic conditions still so weak, a robust housing recovery remains highly unlikely,'' Paul Dales, a United States economist with Capital Economics, wrote in a research note.
The sales report was driven by a nearly 7 percent jump in the South, a 6 percent increase in the West and a 2 percent rise in the Midwest. Pending sales fell nearly 3 percent in the Northeast.
High unemployment, weak job growth and tight credit have hurt the housing market, despite the lowest mortgage rates in decades. Sales picked up in the spring when the government was offering some home buyers tax credits of up to $8,000. Once the incentives expired April 30, sales plunged.
Completed sales of previously occupied homes rose in August, but at the second-slowest annual pace in more than a decade. July's pace was the slowest in 15 years.
In a second report, orders to American factories fell in August, reflecting a big drop in demand for commercial aircraft. But outside of the volatile transportation sector, orders rose for the first time since March.
The Commerce Department said that factory orders fell 0.5 percent in August, the third drop in the last four months. Orders had been up 0.4 percent in July.
The weakness came from a big decline in demand for commercial aircraft and a drop in demand for motor vehicles. However, outside of transportation, orders posted a solid 0.9 percent increase.
The strength outside of transportation reflected big gains in demand for various types of heavy machinery, like oil field drilling equipment, turbines and power generators. Demand was also up for computers and various types of electronic equipment.
Manufacturing has been a standout performer so far in an otherwise subpar economic recovery, as strong overseas demand for manufactured goods has helped offset sluggish domestic consumer spending.
Orders in the transportation sector fell 10.2 percent in July. That included a 40.2 percent drop in demand for commercial aircraft, reflecting a big falloff in orders to the Boeing Company. Commercial aircraft orders had soared 69.1 percent in July.
Orders for motor vehicles and parts dropped 3.6 percent in August as that industry continued to struggle with lackluster demand.
The 0.9 percent rise in orders excluding transportation was the first increase since a 3.8 percent jump in March. Orders excluding transportation had fallen 0.9 percent in July after declines of 0.6 percent in June. 1.2 percent in May and 0.7 percent in April.
These declines reflected a slowdown in the American economy that raised concerns that the country could be dipping back into recession. However, various stronger-than-expected readings in August have allayed the concerns about a new recession.

HEADLINE: Subway Work On 2nd Avenue Orphans Stores

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
The noise, dust, barricades and occasional explosions associated with construction of the long-awaited Second Avenue subway are driving away customers from businesses along the avenue and plunging many shops and restaurants into deep financial trouble, two dozen merchants said.
In July, the Manhattan Chamber of Commerce counted 29 shuttered storefronts between 63rd and 96th Streets -- a once-bustling stretch where the subway's first three stations and the connecting tunnel are being dug. Since then, at least two other businesses have closed. And while the anemic economy has surely taken its toll, many merchants say business has declined 25 percent to 50 percent over the last three years because of the hurdles posed by construction.
''Second Avenue has become a place that shoppers avoid,'' said Jeffrey Bernstein, the chamber's chairman. ''People don't want to come. It's difficult to maneuver.''
The disruption is far worse than many of the merchants had expected when work finally resumed on the subway tunnel on the East Side of Manhattan in 2007, after decades of stop-and-start planning and construction. 
The resulting damage to the local economy is also far worse than they had expected, store owners said. In particular, restaurants and local service stores that depend on sidewalk traffic, like dry cleaners and pet stores, have been hit hard.
''New Yorkers don't go out of their way more than a block and a half for service, so if you make it impossible, they retreat to another location,'' said Faith Hope Consolo, chairwoman of retail leasing and sales at Prudential Douglas Elliman Real Estate.
Even landmark businesses like the 74-year-old Heidelberg Restaurant and Dorrian's Red Hand, a 50-year-old bar, are suffering because construction has gobbled up entire blocks of parking.
Chris Cunningham, a manager of Schaller & Weber, the 73-year-old purveyor of bratwurst and other German specialties, said business was down 30 percent because customers who left Yorkville for the suburbs and who drove in could not double-park to pick up their bags.
The construction has taken away at least one traffic lane along several long stretches where stations are planned, and chewed off five to seven feet of sidewalk in some spots. The work will not be finished until 2017, and many merchants said they doubted they could hold out.
Many say they were misled at meetings about the damage construction would wreak.
''I think they painted a picture at these meetings, and then they delivered something else,'' said Joe Pecora, an owner of Delizia 92 pizzeria and restaurant at 92nd Street, who formed the Second Avenue Business Association two years ago because of the construction's impact.
Officials say they have honored commitments they made to minimize disruption and mitigate noise and dust. Lois Tendler, a vice president for government and community relations at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, said the agency had met regularly with merchants and had signs on its Web site and at Lexington Avenue subway stations urging people to ''Shop Second Avenue.''
Shopkeepers say they need financial help and compensation. But an effort to provide tax relief and grants was vetoed last year by Gov. David A. Paterson.
''We have been incredibly responsive to every feasible request,'' Ms. Tendler said. ''Where we part company with shop owners is that we do not have the ability to pay them for the lost income. We use public money, and we do not know of any government entity that pays for lost business.''
A Second Avenue subway from 125th Street to the Wall Street area to relieve crowding on the Lexington Avenue line has been on the city's agenda since the 1930s. A tunnel section in Harlem was dug in the 1970s, but halted during that era's fiscal crisis.
The current construction phase stretches from 100th Street to 63rd Street and Lexington, where a station connects with the existing Q line. New stations are being built at 96th, 86th and 72nd Streets. The transportation authority has postponed the completion date to 2017 from 2013, and increased cost estimates to almost $5 billion, from $3.8 billion.
A few stores -- including a hardware store and restaurant, whose sites will be used for subway entrances or ventilation -- were closed by eminent domain and the owners compensated. Since then, Mr. Pecora said, he has seen a pharmacy, liquor shop, two dry cleaners, three delis and a tool store cease business.
Two restaurants, CiaoBella at 85th Street, which closed on Wednesday, and Cinema Cafe at 70th Street, which closed at the end of July, say they shut down after losing a large chunk of sidewalk to construction barriers, which prevented them from putting up outdoor tables, a major source of earnings. Their losses were not reimbursed. Dust, noise and ugly views also deterred customers.
Khalid Ziouti, an owner of O.K. Falafel House, a 15-year-old nook at 92nd Street, said much of his trade consisted of drivers of taxis and ambulances who parked or double-parked in front, ran in and picked up a pita meal. With head-high construction barriers sealing off the traffic lane, those drivers go elsewhere, and business is down 35 percent, he said.
Peter Ahn, the owner of Ivory Cleaner near 85th Street, said earnings were down 10 percent because customers told him they were dropping clothes off on more pleasant commercial avenues. Orest Lapan, manager of the Pet Market in the 72nd Street area, said business was off 45 percent and the store was considering closing.
''A lot of people think we're already closed because they can't see us behind the barriers,'' Mr. Lapan said.
Ms. Tendler of the transportation authority said that with the weak economy, stores had been doubly hit. But merchants say that the economy slackened before construction began on their blocks, and that the harm from construction was far worse. Mr. Lapan, the manager of Pet Market, said five other Pet Market locations in the city were thriving.
Merchants assert that they often get a runaround when they complain to the city. Officials of the Bloomberg administration say an outreach team from Small Business Services has taken steps to make sure stores are accessible, extend utility payment plans and check that signs advise passers-by where obscured businesses are located.
But Giorgio Manzio, manager of the three-year-old CiaoBella, which had 25 employees, said that in the months before it closed, the restaurant was ticketed for having tables on too narrow a sidewalk -- a sidewalk narrowed by construction.
Abigail Lootens, a spokeswoman for the Department of Consumer Affairs, said permits had to be revoked for 13 outdoor cafes along the construction zone, with refunds given.
One businesswoman had to call in family for help. Young Yoo, a Korean-born widow who opened Buddha BBeeQ, a narrow Asian grill near 92nd Street, a few months before ground was broken for the subway in front of her store, has exhausted her savings and is three months behind in rent, her son, Peter, 38, said.
A year ago, she brought in Peter, who quit his job as an editor in Binghamton, N.Y., and her daughter to work without pay. He said the family was trying to keep the business alive until April, when Mrs. Yoo, 64, can qualify for Social Security.
''Instead of being a prosperous restaurateur, she'll end up being a penniless person waiting for a check,'' Mr. Yoo said. ''That's what Second Avenue did to her. It created a pauper.''

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths PATTERSON, WILLIAM J

 BODY:
PATTERSON--William J. A prominent San Francisco investor and philanthropist who led the effort to revitalize the California Academy of Sciences, died on Friday, September 24 at age 48 surrounded by his wife, Elizabeth, and their three children. The cause of death was a brain tumor. He was a devoted husband, father, son, brother and friend, who vastly touched so many with his warmth, generosity of spirit, and zest for living. 
His unwavering commitment to making a difference in the world was illuminated by his community leadership, his environmentally focused philanthropy, and the building of a highly successful investment partnership. From a young age, he displayed a natural talent for leadership and excellence. Born in Columbus, Ohio, he spent his childhood in Grand Junction, Colorado, where he developed his reverence for the outdoors that led to his becoming an avid sportsman and environmentalist. He went on to attend Harvard College, graduating magna cum laude in 1984. In his senior year at Harvard he was Co-Captain of the Varsity Lightweight Crew and President of the A.D. Club. He studied economics for one year at Australia National University in Canberra, Australia as a Rotary Foundation Scholar before attending the Stanford Graduate School of Business, graduating as an Arjay Miller Scholar in 1989. After graduating Stanford, he founded SPO Partners & Co. together with John H. Scully and William E. Oberndorf in 1991, which has become one of the nation's leading investment partnerships. At the time of his death, he served as a Managing Director of SPO Partners, Chairman of the Board of Calpine Corporation and was a director of Rosewood Hotels and Resorts. As Chair of the Board of Trustees of the California Academy of Sciences, his leadership helped complete its $500 million capital campaign to build its widely praised new home in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park and greatly expand its environmentally based education programs. He was also a former trustee and board president of the Bay Area Discovery Museum, chaired the Stanford Business School Trust, served as a member of the Advisory Council for the Woods Institute for the Environment at Stanford, and was named a Henry Crown Fellow of the Aspen Institute in 2004. He was an avid runner, collected wine, kept bees, and embraced remote travel and discovery to continually learn about the world around him. In addition to his wife of 23 years, he is survived by his children, William, Eleanor and Graham. He is also survived by his mother, Joan T. McNab of Aspen, Colorado, his father, Dr. William R. Patterson of Grand Junction, Colorado and his siblings Robin J. Blackwood of Bozeman, Montana and Thomas A. Patterson of Portola Valley, California. A memorial service will be announced at a later time. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that donations be made in Mr. Patterson's name to either the California Academy of Sciences or a charitable organization of their choice.

HEADLINE: Breaking Even On A.I.G.

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
''I really didn't know what I was walking into,'' Jim Millstein says about taking one the biggest jobs of his life: unraveling the taxpayers' bailout -- er, investment -- in the American International Group.
A longtime restructuring banker from Lazard who worked on some of the biggest bankruptcies in history, including WorldCom and Argentina, Mr. Millstein holds an unusual title at the Treasury Department: chief restructuring officer. And for the last year and a half, he has been trying to get his arms around the mother of all bailouts.
About six months into his job, after fearing that he might have stepped into an impossible task, he made a startling assertion to his team: ''We'll probably get all our money back.''
It was almost blasphemous to say aloud. The $180 billion bailout of A.I.G. has been widely accepted by both the political left and right as a fiasco that will cost us all dearly. Inside the Treasury, the ''whisper number'' of the total cost had been closer to $100 billion, surely not zero. 
So Mr. Millstein confided in only a handful of people, worried that that it was still early days and that if it leaked, he said, ''Half of the people in Washington would say we were crazy -- 'it's all smoke and mirrors' -- and the other half would say, 'Oh well, we can bank it then.' ''
Last week, his boss, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, endorsed that claim in announcing an ambitious exit plan, including converting much of the company's preferred shares into common equity and paying down loans from the Fed.
As Mr. Millstein had expected, the plan was greeted less by skepticism than by utter disbelief. The public reaction to the Treasury's announcement was predictably swift and incredulous.
''This is little more than a shell game,'' declared Barry Ritholtz, director for equity research for Fusion IQ.
Indeed, how can a company with a supposed stock market value of only $26.2 billion ever pay back more than five times that to taxpayers?
Yet stop for a minute and consider something that is almost heretical to say in the current political climate: Mr. Millstein and Treasury may be right.
Here's his math -- and please bear with me, it's actually not that complicated.
First, the $180 billion headline figure is not the right number to consider. Today, taxpayers have extended loans through the Federal Reserve and Treasury to the tune of about $130 billion, which is still a boatload of money. However, about $30 billion -- and he is rounding numbers here to make this easier -- of that total include assets that are owned in large part by the Federal Reserve through its Maiden Lane funds. Those assets, which were once considered troubled at the height of the panic in September 2008, have since increased in value and are now, as Mr. Millstein contends, ''money good.''
So now we're down to a hole of about $100 billion (or $97 billion if you want to get a bit more exact).
In the next several months, A.I.G.'s sale of its Alico unit to MetLife will be completed, generating about $6.8 billion in cash and $8.7 billion in securities. In addition, A.I.G. is planning an initial public offering of its A.I.A. unit, which should generate somewhere between $12 billion and $15 billion in cash. The cash components of those sales, he said, could generate a total of $22 billion. So at this point, we're still off by $75 billion.
Then the Fed will receive another $4.2 billion from A.I.G.'s sale of its Japan-based life insurance units, AIG StarLifeInsurance and AIG Edison Life Insurance, to Prudential Financial. Now the tally is down to $71 billion.
At this point, A.I.G is going to pay down the Fed's remaining $20 billion stake in two special-purpose vehicles, which hold the rest of Alico and A.I.A, he explained. In doing so, and this is where things get a little tricky, A.I.G. will be using money from the Treasury Department's credit facility. In some ways, the government is moving money from one hand to another.
If all of that works -- and if you're still with me -- A.I.G. will be left owing us, the taxpayers, about $49 billion.
Now, you're probably asking, how can A.I.G., or what's left of it, which is currently worth $26 billion, become a $49 billion company?
As part of the restructuring, Treasury is going to exchange its preferred shares for common shares, expanding the total number of shares of the company and diluting the current investor base. Treasury will own 1.6 billion shares, or 92 percent of the company. At A.I.G.'s share price on Monday, the government's stake would be worth about $62 billion, a $13 billion profit. That's if, of course, shareholders do not send shares tumbling because of the dilution.
Mr. Millstein is betting that investors will be bullish on the stock once they understand the government's plan to exit its investment over time.
So far, big institutional investors like Fidelity and Capital Research have shunned A.I.G. even though they own most of the other insurers.
''None of those guys are in this and they will have to be,'' he said, in part because A.I.G.'s public market capitalization will be so much bigger that it will have to be a bigger part of stock portfolios that track, or index, the insurance industry.
Finally, Mr. Millstein, son of Ira Millstein, the corporate governance guru at Weil, Gotshal & Manges, is gambling that the pure economics of A.I.G. will drive the valuation. Most insurance companies trade at eight to 12 times annual profit. If A.I.G.'s chief executive, Ben Benmosche, is to be believed, the company will make $6 billion to $8 billion in profit.
Of course, not everyone is happy about the deal-making. Some have complained that A.I.G. is pulling a fast one on the government because it will be exchanging preferred shares that pay a dividend and are secured by assets for common shares which would ultimately be worthless. But Mr. Millstein said it was impossible for the government to exit without taking some of ''the equity risk.''
Other critics have argued that the government is rushing its exit of A.I.G., selling off its most valuable businesses just to raise a buck. Maurice R. Greenberg, the company's former chief executive and still a major shareholder, has repeatedly made that complaint. But Mr. Millstein says that the government needs to exit the stock to maintain ''the value of the franchise.'' As he explained it, the government was not being viewed as ''patient capital'' in the market the way you might expect; instead, some investors and customers have been worried about investing and doing business with the company because of the uncertainty around the government's position, he said. Now, he said, the government has made its plans clear.
''We didn't come here to make a profit -- but we should because we took so much risk,'' he said.
Fingers crossed.

HEADLINE: Bailout Loss Is Estimated at $29 Billion

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY

 BODY:
The Treasury Department expects to lose $29 billion on the federal bailouts stemming from the financial crisis, with most of the losses in its housing finance program and the auto rescue.
In a report released on Tuesday, the administration said it expected a $17 billion loss from its investments in General Motors, Chrysler and the auto finance companies, as well as a $46 billion loss from housing programs like the mortgage modification program known as the Home Affordable Modification Program.
The new figures, which include profits that offset some of the losses, come just as the Obama administration tries to wind down the bailout program known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP. Last week, the government announced a plan to exit its investment in the insurer the American International Group. 
Treasury officials have declared the bailout a success, emphasizing that much of the program's money has been returned and that losses are now likely to be less than once expected. The cost, the report says, is far below the $350 billion the Congressional Budget Office once estimated.
''Because of the success of the program, TARP will likely cost a fraction of this amount,'' the report said.
Recently, the Congressional Budget Office put the cost at $66 billion. And, after the bailout, the government will still be left with its investments in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-backed housing finance companies. The report said Fannie and Freddie were expected to cause ''substantial losses,'' but it noted that they were financed using other funds, not the troubled asset funds.
The Treasury arrived at its figure by adding in profits that it expects to receive on shares of A.I.G. stock. Those shares were given to the Treasury by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the Treasury expects they will yield a $22 billion profit. Without those shares, the Treasury would have reported a $51 billion loss, rather than a $29 billion loss, the report said.
In total, the Treasury has received back about $204 billion of the bailout funds, or just over half of the money it doled out. The report segregated the money given out under the Bush administration -- $294 billion -- from the $94 billion awarded under the current administration. All of the large bank bailouts were made under the prior administration, and since then, the money was invested in small banks, automakers, housing programs and A.I.G., the report said.
The bright spot, according to the report, were the bank paybacks. Nearly 80 percent of the money given to banks has been paid back. The Treasury also received $26.8 billion from banks through interest payments on the investments as well as sales of warrants the government received in the banks.
The report did not break down the sources of the automobile losses. The government gave the most money to General Motors and is seeking to recoup some through an initial public offering. The government also gave funds to Chrysler, Chrysler Financial and Ally Bank, formerly GMAC, the auto financing arm of G.M.
The housing programs, the report said, are not expected to return money to the government. Though $45.6 billion has been committed to programs, just $500 million has been paid out, because the Treasury plans to pay out the funds over time if, for instance, modified loans become permanent. The programs include mortgage modifications as well as funds for unemployed homeowners and those whose homes are underwater, or worth less than their mortgage debt.
The last bailout awards were announced last week, as part of the A.I.G. exit plan. The Treasury plans to give A.I.G. $22 billion more. That money will help A.I.G. pay down its debt to the Federal Reserve of New York. In exchange, the Treasury is also receiving the rights to proceeds from two special purpose vehicles from the Fed. The vehicles will pay out based on profits A.I.G. receives on sales of two of its units. The Treasury is predicting no losses on those.
The Government Accountability Office also released a report on Monday about the bailout, which said that the Treasury gave funds to 66 banks that were known to be weak. The bailout program was supposedly intended for banks that were healthy enough to survive without the funds.
In response to that report, a Treasury spokesman said that small banks that received bailout funds lent more money than banks that did not.

HEADLINE: Ex-Trader In France Gets 3 Years

BYLINE: By NICOLA CLARK

 BODY:
PARIS -- When a French judge on Tuesday sentenced Jerome Kerviel, the former Societe Generale trader, to three years in prison and ordered him to repay 4.9 billion in restitution to the bank, the collective gasp from the courtroom clearly signaled that the question of who bears responsibility for banks' aggressive risk-taking in the build-up to the global financial crisis is far from resolved.
The verdict, legal experts said, has once again laid bare the deep distrust among the French public of its elites and its financial institutions -- a suspicion that has only strengthened in the years since the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis brought about the multibillion-dollar bailouts of many of the world's leading financial lights.
''It really does hold him solely responsible, which is probably the most debatable part of the decision,'' said Christopher Mesnooh, an international lawyer with Field Fisher Waterhouse in Paris. ''The message from the court is that Societe Generale -- a leading jewel of the French banking sector -- did not act irresponsibly, but was the victim of a rogue trader.'' 
Mr. Kerviel, 33, whose 50 billion, or $69 billion at current exchange rates, in rogue dealings almost brought about the French bank's demise, was convicted on all counts of breach of trust, forgery and unauthorized use of computer systems. The court sentenced him to five years, with two suspended, and barred him for life from working in financial services.
Caroline Guillaumin, a spokeswoman for Societe Generale, said the 4.9 billion damage award was a ''symbolic'' sum that the bank did not expect would be paid. ''But it is important, and we are satisfied, because it recognizes that the entirety of the bank's losses are attributed to Jerome Kerviel's actions,'' she said.
Mr. Kerviel stood impassively while the verdict was read, betraying no emotion.
His lawyer, Olivier Metzner, said he would appeal. ''This judgment is totally unreasonable,'' he said outside the court. ''It suggests that the bank is not responsible for anything, that no system of control could have prevented this.''
The court agreed that the former trader could remain free until the outcome of that appeal, which legal experts said was unlikely to be heard before late next year.
Legal analysts said they were not surprised by the prison sentence -- which was in fact shorter than the minimum four years that prosecutors had sought.
But it was the size of the awarded damages, equal to the entire amount the bank lost in unwinding his trades in early 2008, that seemed aimed at insulating French banks in general -- and particularly a bank renowned for its expertise in complex financial derivatives -- from accusations of lax oversight and U.S.-style ''casino capitalism.''
''It's a whitewash,'' Bradley D. Simon, a white-collar criminal defense attorney at Simon & Partners in New York who specializes in securities and bank fraud, said of the verdict. ''The evidence does not support absolving the bank completely,'' he said. ''This was a lot larger than Kerviel.''
Societe Generale had admitted to management failures and weaknesses in its risk control systems. An internal audit published in May 2008 described Mr. Kerviel's immediate supervisors as ''deficient'' and acknowledged that the bank had failed to follow through on at least 74 internal alerts about Mr. Kerviel's trading activities dating to mid-2006.
The French Banking Commission later fined Societe Generale 4 million.
Yet Dominique Pauthe, the presiding judge, ruled that Societe Generale's failure to detect Mr. Kerviel's dealings for more than two years did not absolve the trader of primary responsibility for the bank's huge losses.
''The lack of vigilance by the bank in monitoring the only existing limits, acting as alert signs, hardly exempted Jerome Kerviel from his duty to inform his hierarchy of the reality of his excesses or to come back within the limits imposed,'' Mr. Pauthe said, reading excerpts from the 73-page ruling. ''By his deliberate actions, he put in peril the existence of the bank that employed 140,000 people, of which he was a part, and whose future he mortgaged,'' he said.
The Societe Generale scandal was one of the first fractures in the facade of what was then broadly perceived as an aggressive but essentially self-regulating financial system, giving rise to early calls against excessive risk-taking and lavish bonuses that have grown steadily louder since.
It came not long after the first indications of the subprime mortgage crisis surfaced in the United States in August 2007 and was followed in March and September of 2008 by the demise of two flagship investment banks, Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers. In December of that year, Bernard L. Madoff's Ponzi scheme was uncovered, a fraud that set investors back more than $20 billion, according to estimates by the court-appointed trustee overseeing the case.
More recently, Fabrice Tourre, another French banker, and his employer, Goldman Sachs, were sued by the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission in April for creating and selling mortgage products that regulators contend were secretly devised to fail.
''There was a tremendous culture -- and it still has not disappeared -- among financial institutions around the world at that time to take big risks in order to make the maximum profit,'' Mr. Simon said. ''It is not unreasonable to conclude that Jerome Kerviel felt that, that it was bred into him.''
The unwinding of an estimated 50 billion in unauthorized open positions on Mr. Kerviel's trading book in late January 2008 cost Societe Generale 4.9 billion, the equivalent of about $7 billion at the time.
Mr. Kerviel acknowledged at his trial that he had falsified documents and entered fake trades to hide his activities, but he maintained that his bosses had deliberately turned a blind eye to what he was doing and had tacitly encouraged him as long as it was profitable.
Mr. Kerviel had been placing bets outside his trading limit for more than two years. The bank has said it booked 1.4 billion in profit in the fourth quarter of 2007 from his unauthorized dealings.
But when the market turned against him, eight large transactions entered into the bank's computers in mid-December exposed the bank to 50 billion in risk -- more than the market value of the bank. His last and, by far, biggest gamble was discovered Jan. 18, 2008. It was the unwinding of those trades, from Jan. 21 to Jan. 23, that led to the loss of 4.9 billion.
In the aftermath of the scandal, Mr. Kerviel spent five weeks in pretrial detention and became something of a French folk hero. Much was made of the fact that someone from such a modest background -- his mother was a hairdresser, his late father a metal-shop teacher -- could dupe so many of his bosses, many of them well-bred graduates of the best French schools.
''There was a lot of talk of him being a modern-day Robin Hood,'' said Stephane Bonifassi, a lawyer in Paris. ''It showed the distrust that the French public has of its elites. Rather than pitying the banks, they made Kerviel a hero.''
''Now Kerviel is ruined for the rest of his life,'' Mr. Bonifassi said. ''The court clearly did not accept such populist notions.''
Mr. Kerviel's conviction follows the dismissal last week of a U.S. shareholder lawsuit accusing the French bank of concealing losses linked to the trading scandal, as well as the extent of its exposure to subprime mortgages.
Citing a U.S. Supreme Court decision in June, a U.S. court in New York ruled that the investors -- including several pension funds -- could not sue in the United States for losses linked to their investments in foreign companies.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: September Rally Extends Into October

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
Stock markets continued a robust rally Wednesday in Asia, a day after the market in the United States turned in one of its best performances in months.
The gains in Asia - Japan's Nikkei index was up 1.4 percent by midday - came after a strong rise Tuesday in equities markets in the United States, where it appeared that that the rally that produced the best September performance since 1939 was being extended into October. American markets jumped after the Bank of Japan took new currency measures Tuesday to support its economy, and after a report in the United States on the services sector showed improvements in hiring that exceeded analysts' expectations.
The Dow Jones industrial average was up 193.45 points Tuesday, or 1.8 percent, to 10,944.72. It was the Dow's highest close since May 3, when it ended at 11,151.83. 
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 23.72 points, or 2.09 percent, to 1,160.75, while the Nasdaq rose 55.31 points, or 2.36 percent, to 2,399.83.
The markets have continued a rally this month that began in September, when the S.& P. rose nearly 9 percent. The index is up just over 4 percent in the year to date.
On Tuesday, most of the S.& P. sectors were up more than 2 percent.
''It is a pretty remarkable day from the get-go,'' said Peter Tuz, president at Chase Investment Counsel. ''With the, I guess you would call it, quantitative easing in Japan, it just seemed to propel U.S. stocks higher. There is global pressure to keep interest rates low and keeping interest rates low is generally a good thing for the stock market.''
Material stocks, gold and oil were strong, he noted, ''the sector set that you would think would do well with economic growth around the world.''
The markets took off Tuesday after the Bank of Japan lowered its benchmark lending rate to near zero and said that it would set up a fund of 5 trillion yen ($60 billion) to buy Japanese government bonds, commercial paper and other asset-backed securities amid concerns about weakening growth in Japan's economy.
Momentum seems to be building for the Federal Reserve to buy more government securities -- perhaps as soon as its next meeting in early November. The Fed and its chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, have signaled that the central bank may resume buying government debt to spur the recovery.
The Japanese move, the likelihood of the Fed's quantitative easing and even expectations of Bank of England action along the same lines were all helping to push stocks higher.
But the bank's efforts did little to weaken the yen, which traded at about 84 to the dollar after the announcement, but later slipped to 83.23. A stronger yen has hurt Japan's export-driven economy.
The euro strengthened against the dollar, and the United States currency slid against other major and emerging market currencies.
Shares in Tokyo rose 1.5 percent, and in London, the FTSE 100 index gained 79.79 points, or 1.44 percent.
Gold continued to rise, and the rates on 10-year Treasury notes dropped to 2.47 percent from 2.48 percent late Monday.
Shares also got a lift from a services-sector index for September, which, in the minds of traders, helped to confirm that the economy was not headed toward a double-dip recession.
The Institute for Supply Management said its service sector index rose to 53.2 last month from 51.5 in August, topping expectations of 52.
Shares of the credit card company American Express fell 77 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $38.28 after it said that it would challenge an antitrust complaint filed by the Justice Department. Shares of its two rivals, MasterCard and Visa, rose on a proposed settlement in the same case, which came after those companies agreed not to prohibit merchants from offering customers discounts or rebates for using a particular kind of card. MasterCard rose $3.26, to $225.90. Shares of Visa rose $1.75, to $74.99.

HEADLINE: Judgment Day in Two High-Profile Cases: Times Square's Would-Be Bomber Is Defiant as He Gets a Life Term

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WILSON

 BODY:
The defendant came to Federal District Court in Manhattan on Tuesday ready to ladle out several minutes of anti-American justification for his act of terrorism in Times Square. But the judge, Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum, best known of late for presiding over Martha Stewart's trial, came ready, too.
She repeatedly interrupted the defendant, Faisal Shahzad, to spar with him over his interpretation of the Koran, his invocation of a Muslim warrior in the Crusades and, above all, the relevance of any of it to the life sentence that hung over him like the dozen United States deputy marshals who guarded the prisoner in court. 
And after the judge formally sentenced Mr. Shahzad to life in prison, she left him a parting shot: ''I do hope that you will spend some of the time in prison thinking carefully about whether the Koran wants you to kill lots of people.''
The six or eight minutes or so of back and forth brought a bit of drama to the endgame of a case that, as nerve-rattling as it was at its inception, with the discovery of a potentially lethal bomb in Times Square on May 1, had drawn to a close with the sentencing on Tuesday.
The hearing was a part-sentencing and part-scolding, and the latter started before the former. Judge Cedarbaum looked at Mr. Shahzad, seated between lawyers, his beard thick and his hair long under his white skullcap, and said, ''I think you should get up.''
Mr. Shahzad, 31, rose. He seemed to have aged in the last five months from the boyish man who was arrested aboard a jet at Kennedy Airport.
He asked the judge for 5 or 10 minutes, then launched into a soliloquy that was at times rambling, at times threatening and delivered with the crinkly-eyed grin of a man who acted as if he could not be happier than where he was at that moment.
''This is but one life,'' he said. ''If I am given a thousand lives, I will sacrifice them all for the sake of Allah, fighting this cause, defending our lands, making the word of Allah supreme over any religion or system.''
He made his one and only reference to his arrest by claiming, for the first time, that his rights had been denied. Law enforcement officials have said that immediately following his arrest, on May 3, Mr. Shahzad cooperated, but he said otherwise on Tuesday.
''On the second day of my arrest, I asked for the Miranda,'' he said, referring to the required notification of his right to counsel. ''And the F.B.I. denied it to me for two weeks'' and threatened his wife and children, he said. The judge, prosecutors and defense lawyers stayed silent as Mr. Shahzad, who has mounted no substantive defense in his case and who pleaded guilty to all charges against him on June 21, continued to speak. His lawyer, Philip L. Weinstein, had no comment on the statements after the hearing.
Mr. Shahzad attacked the American military forces ''who have occupied the Muslim lands,'' and said that attacks like his attempted bombing would continue.
''Brace yourselves, because the war with Muslims has just begun,'' he said. ''Consider me only a first droplet of the flood that will follow me.''
He went on about the war and about the ''fragile economy'' that he said would soon prove unable to sustain the troops, when Judge Cedarbaum interrupted and asked, ''Do you want to comment in any way in connection with sentence?'' He said he was getting to that, his motivations, when the judge asked, ''Didn't you swear allegiance to this country when you became an American citizen?''
He smiled like a boy caught in a fib, and said as much: ''I did swear, but I did not mean it.''
''You took a false oath?''
''Yes.''
''Very well. Is there anything else you want to tell me?''
''Sure,'' he began, and went on to say, ''Blessed be'' Osama bin Laden, ''who will be known as no less than Saladin of the 21st-century crusade, and blessed be those who give him asylum.''
The judge stopped him again. ''How much do you know about Saladin, as you called him?''
He is known in the Middle East as Salahuddin al-Ayubi, but commonly known in the West as Saladin, the Muslim leader who took Jerusalem from the Crusaders in 1187. He is remembered in biographies as being a lover of peace who waged war reluctantly.
''He didn't want to kill people,'' the judge told the defendant.
''He liberated -- '' Mr. Shahzad continued.
''He was a very moderate man,'' Judge Cedarbaum said. Mr. Shahzad spoke more about the war in Iraq and said, ''If you call us terrorists, then we are proud terrorists, and we will keep on terrorizing until you leave our land and people at peace.''
He finished, and it was time for the sentencing by Judge Cedarbaum. ''Although happily, the training you sought in making bombs was unsuccessful and you were unsuccessful in your effort to kill many Americans,'' she said, the facts of the case ''require that you be incarcerated for life.''
She began going through the 10 separate sentences he faced: ''I sentence you to life in prison,'' she said.
''Allahu akbar,'' he replied. (''God is great.'')
''I understand that you welcome that,'' the judge said.
Mr. Shahzad was handcuffed and led away.
Correction: October 14, 2010, Thursday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Oct. 6 about the sentencing of the Times Square car bomber, Faisal Shahzad, referred incorrectly to the jetliner that he was on at the time of his arrest. It was still at the gate at Kennedy Airport; it had not been cleared for takeoff.

WASHINGTON -- The United States is increasingly looking to the International Monetary Fund to hold countries like China accountable for ''rebalancing'' the global economy, a Treasury Department official said Tuesday.
Exchange rates are expected to be a major topic when finance ministers gather here this weekend for the annual meetings of the I.M.F. and the World Bank.
In a briefing Tuesday, a senior Treasury official said the United States was looking to the I.M.F. to ensure that countries contribute to ''strong, sustainable and balanced growth'' -- the mantra adopted when leaders of the Group of 20 economic powers, including President Obama, gathered in Pittsburgh in September 2009 to coordinate the world's emergence from the financial crisis. 
In practical terms, the slogan means that export-oriented economies like China, Japan and Germany should stimulate domestic demand while heavily indebted countries, like the United States, should reduce their trade and budget deficits, by saving and investing more and borrowing and spending less. But while the world's biggest economies have adopted those goals in principle, achieving them in practice has proved difficult.
The unity of the G-20 countries has been repeatedly tested this year, by the European debt crisis, China's reluctance to allow its currency to appreciate in value, steep budget cuts in Britain, and Japan's recent move to devalue the yen, among other developments.
The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the Treasury, did not single out China by name but made it clear that the Obama administration was impatient over Beijing's halting progress in permitting greater exchange-rate flexibility for its currency, the renminbi, as Chinese officials promised to do in June.
''The United States has been very consistent in its position that the leading economies should be supporting exchange rates based on market fundamentals,'' the official said, adding: ''We expect that countries will continue to move toward honoring the full set of their G-20 commitments.''
The I.M.F. managing director, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, said last week that he did not see a great risk of a ''currency war'' -- with countries devaluing their currencies to make their exports cheaper -- as some countries, like Brazil, fear. Nonetheless, he is expected to make currency a priority this weekend.
In its semiannual report on global financial stability, the fund also warned Tuesday that the world financial system ''is still in a period of significant uncertainty and remains the Achilles' heel of the economic recovery.''
Jose Vinals, director of the monetary and capital markets department at the I.M.F., called for countries to tackle the high public debts through fiscal consolidation over the medium term, address lingering vulnerabilities in their banking systems and make more progress on overhauling financial regulations.
Mr. Vinals also said that countries in Latin America and Asia were experiencing ''very large amounts'' of capital inflows, a result of the attractive investment returns, growth prospects and solid balance sheets. Large influxes of capital could cause macroeconomic instability if they were not carefully monitored, he said.
Progress toward stability ''experienced a setback'' since the last such report was released in April, the new report found, a result of anxieties over heavily indebted countries like Greece and Spain.
Both countries have taken drastic measures to pare government spending. They have been joined by Britain, whose budget cuts have been so severe that Americans have expressed anxiety about the potential impact on the world economy if too many governments cut their budgets at once as they exit from stimulus programs adopted in response to the crisis.
''We have to be careful to avoid a premature, synchronized exit that could threaten the global economic recovery,'' said the Treasury official who briefed reporters on Tuesday.
The I.M.F. report also addressed other risks to global financial stability.
It drew attention to ''liquidity disruption'' -- ''the simultaneous and protracted inability of financial institutions to roll over or obtain new short-term funding across both markets and borders'' -- as a defining characteristic of the financial crisis. And it argued that the reliance on credit rating agencies to assess the risks facing sovereign countries had contributed to the instability that surrounded Europe's debt crisis this year.
But the Treasury official underscored the reality that the fund's main power is to produce research and monitor its members' practices; it does not have the tools to enforce global agreements or compliance.
''It's ultimately the responsibility of countries to act, but the fund must speak out effectively about the need for those actions,'' the Treasury official said, adding that the I.M.F. needed to be ''very clear in its communications on the extent to which countries are living up to their obligations.''
American officials also plan to use the meetings to continue a push for Europe to give up some of its seats on the I.M.F. board to allow greater representation of big emerging economies. Despite European resistance, the United States will push ahead ''because of the critical importance of strengthening the I.M.F.'s legitimacy and credibility,'' the officials said.

HEADLINE: Dim Outlook for Holiday Jobs

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD and CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
As the economy sputters, prospects are dimming for unemployed workers who were banking on a seasonal retail job to carry them through the holidays.
After a disappointing back-to-school season, many retailers say they intend to barely increase their seasonal jobs from last year, when hiring was among the lowest in the 14 years tracked by the National Retail Federation.
Some big national chains -- like Wal-Mart and Best Buy -- say they will not hire any more workers than last year. And even some of the more bullish retailers say the growth will not be significant. 
''It's a slight increase, it's not a huge increase,'' said Jim Sluzewski, a spokesman at Macy's, which expects to hire 65,000 seasonal workers.
The recruiting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, forecasts that retailers will add up to 600,000 jobs in October, November and December, compared with a net gain of 501,400 holiday jobs over the same three months in 2009.
''This is slow digging out of a deep recession,'' said John A. Challenger, the firm's chief executive.
Temporary hiring is often a way for employers to test the waters before committing to permanent hiring, which is why the big gains in the temporary help services industry in the fall of 2009 -- hiring unrelated to the holiday retail season -- brought hope last year that the job market was turning around.
But it is hard to get excited about the holiday hiring announcements this year, retail analysts said, as many companies are adding workers largely because they are entering the season with lean full-time headcounts. And in the cases of chains like Toys ''R'' Us and Borders, there is little possibility that the temporary workers will become permanent because many are being hired to work in so-called pop-up stores -- temporary stores on short leases.
''It's all a way of managing risk, given how much uncertainty there still is out there,'' said David Weil, an economics professor at the Boston University School of Management.
''These companies are buying themselves more flexibility by relying more on temporary workers than in the past. If the season doesn't develop as they'd hoped, they're not on the hook in the same way,'' he said.
It is also not clear when the seasonal hiring will happen.
Challenger Gray expects that companies may wait to hire until November or December -- once they have a feel for how much consumers are willing to spend.
In a report to be released on Wednesday, the National Retail Federation projects that holiday retail sales will increase 2.3 percent over their level in 2009.
Among the retailers adding workers, Toys ''R'' Us said it would hire 45,000 workers, compared with 35,000 last year; the 10,000 additional employees will staff 600 pop-up stores. J. C. Penney said it would hire 30,000 workers, ''a slight increase over last year,'' a spokeswoman, Darcie M. Brossart, said in an e-mail.
''We align our store staffing with expected customer traffic,'' she said.
Other retailers say they will keep holiday staffing on par with last year, including Wal-Mart and Neiman Marcus, which do not specify the planned number of hires, and Best Buy, which said its 29,000 holiday employees would be about the same as last year.
Over all, full-time work in retail is slightly down. The number of people employed in the retail sector in August fell 4.9 percent, to 14.4 million, from a year earlier, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
The jobs themselves are also less than ideal for many struggling families, given that they often lack benefits and provide unpredictable and relatively short hours.
Even before the recession began, the typical retail worker's week had shrunk to fewer than 32 hours, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Still, adding low-wage retail jobs can help give a kick to local economies.
''These jobs are typically going to people who spend 100 percent of their income just to get by,'' says Francoise Carre, research director at the Center for Social Policy at the University Massachusetts-Boston.
''So if you're looking at local income,'' she said, ''that's a good thing because it puts money in the hands of people who go out and spend it versus people who just save it.''
While retailers are just now making plans for Christmas hiring, they had to make plans for Christmas merchandise months ago, and that lag might create some inventory problems.
In the first part of the year, the economic picture looked much brighter. In March, retailers tracked by Thomson Reuters turned in the highest gain in sales in stores open at least a year, a 9.1 percent increase, since Thomson Reuters began covering those figures in 2000.
That was at about the same time that retailers had to order holiday merchandise because of the time it takes to produce and ship the inventory.
And recent traffic at the nation's ports suggests that retailers made optimistic bets. The Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles, which together handle about 40 percent of all American imports, said that in August, one of their highest-traffic months due to the arriving holiday shipments, they imported about 710,000 containers of goods. That is slightly more than the ports handled in August 2007, when the economy was roaring.
Demand for freight space, especially from retailers, has been so great that shipping lines have added vessels back into their fleets, said Richard D. Steinke, executive director for the Port of Long Beach.
''Freight rates are dropping and capacity is back,'' he said.
All that stuff coming into ports means that some retailers may have been too hopeful and ordered too much inventory back when the economy looked better.
''Some retailers may have incorrectly extrapolated into the future, and may have placed excessive merchandise bets back in the spring for this Christmas,'' said Robert F. Buchanan, a finance professor at St. Louis University's Cook School of Business who studies retailers.
''That could hurt them come this Christmas, if Christmas is as slow as I think it will be,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Global Fight Against AIDS Falters as Pledges Fail to Reach Goal of $13 Billion

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.; Neil MacFarquhar contributed reporting from the United Nations.

 BODY:
In another signal that the global battle against AIDS is falling apart for lack of money, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria failed on Tuesday to reach even its lowest ''austerity level'' fund-raising target of $13 billion -- the amount it had said it needed just to keep putting patients on treatment at current rates.
Three-year pledges from 40 countries attending a two-day conference held in Manhattan amounted to $11.7 billion. The pledges were announced at the United Nations. The fund had hoped to raise $20 billion to catch up with the growing epidemic. 
No one now on treatment will be cut off, said Dr. Michel Kazatchkine, the fund's executive director, but the targets for the next few years must be lowered.
He said that he ''deeply appreciates'' the amount raised, but that ''we need to recognize that it's not enough to meet expected demand and will lead to difficult decisions in the next three years.''
He could not, he said, estimate exactly how many deaths would result.
The fund pays for AIDS drugs for almost three million patients now, and still might be able to reach four million by 2013. It had hoped to reach five million or more.
It supports about half of the world's poor who are getting treatment. The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or Pepfar, started under the administration of President George W. Bush, pays for the other half.
An estimated 33 million people are infected worldwide, a number that grows by a million people a year after adding new infections and subtracting deaths.
Of that number, about 14 million are already so sick that, under World Health Organization guidelines, they should be on drugs. It looks increasingly likely that that number will outpace the number getting drugs.
The United States pledged $4 billion, which is a nearly 40 percent increase over its previous contribution. It is by far the most generous donor, and most countries raised their contributions by less.
France, Canada and Norway went up by 20 percent, Japan by 28 percent. Britain, Sweden and the Netherlands could not commit because of budget cycles, but were expected to be in that ballpark; Italy and Spain gave nothing. South Africa, which has the world's worst AIDS epidemic, made a token contribution of $2 million. Russia and China gave $60 million and $14 million respectively, far less than fund officials had hoped. To reach the fund's $20 billion goal, all countries would have had to roughly double their giving.
AIDS activists vented open frustration, both with the overall result and the American contribution.
''This is a modest course correction, not what we were hoping for in terms of U.S. leadership,'' said Dr. Paul Zeitz, executive director of the Global AIDS Alliance, an advocacy group that had lobbied the administration for a $6 billion contribution. ''This took the other donors off the hook. Everyone could aim low.''
By not reaching a decision earlier, he complained, the United States dithered away its leverage over other countries.
Under American law, the United States can contribute only one-third of the fund. If it had told other donors privately weeks ago that it intended a 40 percent increase, they would have been under pressure to match that, both to avoid sounding cheap, and because the United States cannot pay unless its donation is matched 2 to 1.
Dr. Eric Goosby, the global AIDS coordinator, said the intra-administration debate about how much to pledge was ''robust'' and went on right up until Tuesday morning.
''We're proud of the pledge,'' Dr. Goosby said in a telephone interview. Getting the United States, which has a one-year budget cycle, to commit to a three-year pledge was ''swimming upstream,'' especially in such a weak economy.
The battles against malaria and tuberculosis will also suffer, but the effect on AIDS is easier to measure. Malaria waxes and wanes with hot weather and local spraying. The TB epidemic echoes the AIDS epidemic because so many people have both, but TB can be cured in six months, which shrinks case counts rapidly.

HEADLINE: Voters Face Decisions on a Mix of Issues

BYLINE: By A. G. SULZBERGER

 BODY:
The nation's job woes may be the determining factor in which party controls Congress, but voters across the country will also have the chance to weigh in directly -- through ballot initiatives -- on some of the other contentious issues that have made cameo turns in the spotlight this year.
In Oklahoma, the ballot will feature a measure to ban state judges from using Islamic law, called Sharia, in court decisions, even though it has never happened. In Washington, voters will address an issue similar to one Republicans successfully kept from coming to a vote in the United States Senate: a proposed tax increase for the rich. 
Voters in three states will have the opportunity to take a largely symbolic stand against the federal health care law approved this year by declaring that individuals or business cannot be compelled to buy health insurance. And in Colorado, leaders of all political persuasions are joining to urge voters to reject three tax initiatives they say would drive the state to fiscal calamity.
In total, 155 measures are on the ballots in 36 states, a number roughly unchanged from previous years. While lacking the thematic cohesion of years past -- when states around the country simultaneously weighed in on issues like abortion, same-sex marriage or eminent domain -- this year's raft of initiatives, referendums and propositions nonetheless capture the political spirit of the season.
Perennially divisive issues are back: Colorado voters will decide whether to define human life as beginning at fertilization; Oklahoma voters will decide whether to make English the official state language; and, in perhaps the nation's most closely watched referendum, California voters will decide whether to allow the sale of marijuana for recreational use.
But most of the measures to be decided on Election Day are routine housekeeping: fiscal proposals -- like bond requests, property tax exemptions and licensing fees -- that capture the constant ideological tug of war of taxing and spending.
''What it feels like is that the state legislatures are really fixated on the routine budgetary stuff, trying to keep their ships afloat,'' said John G. Matsusaka, president of the Initiative and Referendum Institute at the University of Southern California. ''The ballot propositions seem to have become an outlet for all the other issues that the legislators don't have the time to deal with right now.''
Government spending is at the heart of the three ballot measures in Arizona, Colorado and Oklahoma -- which, along with California, have the longest and most controversial lineup of ballot measures this year -- that aim to nullify President Obama's signature health care legislation. The measures, which are similar to one overwhelmingly approved by voters in Missouri this summer and approved legislatively in five other states, would establish that individuals or business cannot be compelled to buy health insurance or pay a tax penalty. The effect, however, is uncertain, given that the requirement does not become effective until 2014 and is already the subject of lawsuits.
The proposed constitutional ban on judges' using international law in general -- and Sharia law in particular -- in Oklahoma has caused local Muslim leaders to complain that the state legislators behind the proposal were ''riding a wave'' of anti-Islamic sentiment across the nation, citing the controversy over burning Korans and protest over mosques elsewhere. ''Sharia law is not a threat to anyone, I don't care where you live,'' said Saad Mohammed, a director at the Islamic Society of Greater Oklahoma City. ''Bigotry and prejudice is driving this.''
State Representative Rex Duncan, who is chairman of the state judiciary panel and the lead sponsor of the measure, said he knew of no judge ever citing Sharia law in a ruling in Oklahoma and could point to only one case in the country where the law had been cited. (In that case, a Family Court judge in New Jersey cited a man's Islamic faith in denying a restraining order to a woman who said she had been raped by her husband. The ruling was overturned by a higher court.) But Mr. Duncan said the measure was ''a pre-emptive strike.''
Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, has called for a similar federal law, and Mr. Duncan said he had received inquiries from legislators in a dozen other states who expressed interest in adopting a similar ban.
The political rhetoric has grown particularly heated in Colorado, where Republican and Democratic politicians as well as labor and business groups have united to warn that the passage of three tax-cutting measures -- dubbed the ''ugly three'' by opponents -- would lead to such fiscal disaster that governing the state would be ''nearly impossible.'' They cite official state analysis that concluded that the budget would be cut by a quarter and the state would also be prohibited from taking on debt, preventing large capital projects.
''I've never seen a fiscal impact comparable to what would happen if all three of these were to pass,'' said Jennie D. Bowser, who studies ballot initiatives for the National Conference of State Legislatures.
The Washington initiative would create the state's first income tax, exclusively on individuals who earn more than $200,000 -- the same figure favored by President Obama, who has proposed extending tax cuts for individuals making less than that amount but allowing taxes to rise for those making more. (The tax rate would be 5 percent and increase to 9 percent for those making more than $500,000.)
The debate follows the national framing. Supporters say that the tax is needed to continue paying for services (it would be devoted to education and health care) and would affect only a tiny fraction of people while allowing taxes to be cut for everybody else. Critics say the increase would discourage business investment and prolong the recession, questioning whether politicians can be trusted with greater access to taxpayer money.
As with all state initiatives, the back and forth features a local flavor. The pro-tax effort is being led by Bill Gates Sr. and endorsed by his son, the Microsoft founder; the anti-tax effort is being supported by the current head of Microsoft, Steve Ballmer.

HEADLINE: Credit for the Recovery

BYLINE: By DANIEL GROSS. 
Daniel Gross, author of ''Dumb Money: How Our Greatest Financial Minds Bankrupted the Nation,'' is the economics editor and columnist at Yahoo! Finance.

 BODY:
EVERY time the United States suffers a recession, trendspotters hasten to identify signs of frugality, extol the rediscovery of thrift and find evidence that Americans are finally (finally!) kicking their demon debt habit. We crack open history books to locate the anti-debt impulse in pre-revolutionary America and troll through quotation collections for ammunition. I've been around long enough to go through this exercise twice -- first in the early 1990s and then in 2001 after the dot-com bust. Here we go again.
Since the comprehensive, economy-wide debt bubble of the aughts burst spectacularly in September 2008, Americans, we are told, have rediscovered their inner skinflint. Indeed, the savings rate, which fell into negative territory in 2005 at the height of the boom, bounced back strongly. Through 2009 and thus far in 2010, Americans have been setting aside 5 percent to 7 percent of disposable income as savings. Web sites like couponmom.com and Groupon have attracted millions of penny-pinching users. 
When the Federal Reserve reports figures on consumer credit, despite the dry prose, we conjure up visions of shoppers throwing their Visa cards into public bonfires. ''Household debt contracted at an annual rate of 2 1/4 percent in the second quarter, the ninth consecutive quarterly decline,'' the central bank reported last month. The outstanding balances of revolving credit accounts -- i.e. credit cards -- peaked in 2008 at a little less than $1 trillion, and have fallen for 22 straight months, to $827 billion in July 2010.
It's a great story -- if you believe it.
In fact, though, since the Lehman Brothers debacle in September 2008, the nations' total indebtedness has continued its inexorable rise, some measures of consumer debt are starting to rise again and the easy-money, no-money-down culture still prevails in crucial sectors.
Oh, and a look at the data suggests that the decline in personal debt is driven less by Americans giving up on credit cards than on credit card issuers giving up on Americans.
CardHub.com, a credit-card industry site, crunched data from rating agencies and the Federal Reserve and found that in the 18-month period from January 2009 through June 2010, American lenders simply wrote off $124.1 billion in credit card balances as uncollectable. That accounts for nearly the entire $134 billion decline in revolving credit balances outstanding in the same period. And in the second quarter of this year, company write-offs were actually nearly $10 billion greater than the amount consumers paid down.
A similar dynamic may be taking place in the much larger housing-debt market. Mortgage debt has fallen for nine straight quarters -- from $10.5 trillion in the first quarter of 2008 to $10.1 trillion in the second quarter of this year. But anyone who works in the industry knows that most of this decline can likely be ascribed to lenders writing off many of the loans they had heedlessly extended during the boom.
Meanwhile, as the economy slowly recovers, there are signs that Americans are rediscovering their free-spending ways. Total consumer credit, which includes non-revolving debt like car loans, has stabilized, and it rose in both June and July. It's back to where it was in the second quarter of 2009. Collectively, we don't seem to have run our credit cards through shredders. Mailboxes are again stuffed with credit card solicitations. Newspapers are filled with come-ons from car dealers offering zero-percent financing. The Federal Housing Authority offers mortgages on houses for as little as 3 percent down. You'd be forgiven for thinking that we've flown back in time to September 2006.
And, believe it or not, that's a good thing. The economic expansion that has been going along in fits and starts since June 2009 was initially powered by government stimulus and business investment. But for this recovery to mature, broaden and persist, the greatest economic force known to mankind -- the American consumer -- has to get back in the game.
In an economy in which consumers account for 70 percent of activity, credit is both a vital lubricant and the indispensable fuel. Money may make the world go 'round, but credit makes the gears of commerce run smoothly.
Many of our largest and most significant industries still have business models that rely on the use of debt to purchase goods and services. Unless you're a multimillionaire, it's difficult to make significant purchases -- college tuition, a Viking stove, a Toyota Prius, computers, jewelry, a house -- out of savings or cash flow from wages. The renewed willingness and confidence to spend money we don't have is vital to the continuing recovery.
John Maynard Keynes wrote of the paradox of thrift -- if everyone saves, everyone becomes poorer, because demand for goods and services will fall. Here's another paradox: Running up consumer debt may be a moral failure and a recipe for long-term damnation, but it also contains the roots of our short-term salvation.

HEADLINE: Retailers Go With Discounts for Halloween

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
FOR Halloween, what are consumers telling Madison Avenue they consider creepy and kooky, mysterious and spooky, and altogether ooky? High prices.
This Halloween is the third in a row for which marketers and retailers are playing up discounts, deals and bargains rather than goblins, ghosts and vampires. With the economy continuing to bewitch, bother and bewilder shoppers, the goal is to encourage purchases even if they take place at sale prices reminiscent of post-Halloween clearances.
For instance, a circular for the Michaels chain of craft stores promises ''monstrous savings'' and ''spooktacular buys on Halloween decor,'' including prices that are 25 to 40 percent off. 
The Ultimate Halloween catalog from the Party City retail chain offers up to 50 percent off on costumes like piglets, cyborg aliens, punk creeps and Wednesday Addams. ''Nobody has more Halloween for less,'' the cover proclaims.
Amazon.com sent e-mails to customers that also offered up to 50 percent off on Halloween costumes, along with free shipping.
And ads for Target, introducing a line of Halloween costumes by Simon Doonan of Barneys New York, tell customers they can ''look drop-dead gorgeous'' at ''a wicked va-va-value.''
The price-conscious pitches for Halloween reflect that ''everything is about price now, everything,'' said Candace Corlett, president at WSL Strategic Retail, a consultancy in New York.
''Halloween is one of those holidays we went way overboard for'' during the boom years, she added, which has turned it into ''a symbol of excess.''
''Now, we're going back to Halloweens more like the 1980s, when it was a fun holiday but not a big-spending holiday,'' Ms. Corlett said.
Fortunately for consumers, she added, ''Halloween is a holiday you can get by without spending a lot.''
The Six Flags amusement parks are taking $10 or $20 off the admission prices for their annual Fright Fest events in various markets for customers who bring cans of Coca-Cola when they buy tickets.
''Additionally, we've got a very aggressive season pass offer this year,'' Brett Petit, senior vice president for marketing at Six Flags in New York, wrote in an e-mail. For example, patrons who buy passes for 2011 now will receive free admissions for the rest of this year, including Fright Fest.
Six Flags has signed the Snickers line of candy bars sold by Mars to be the presenting sponsor of Fright Fest. That is not the only effort Mars is making to stimulate sales for Halloween.
In addition to running television commercials and print advertisements with Halloween themes for M&Ms, which Mars has done for many years, the company is also, for the first time, using Halloween themes to hawk two other candy brands, Snickers and Milky Way.
Candy sales have been increasingly lately, said Debra A. Sandler, chief consumer officer for the Mars Chocolate North America unit of Mars in Hackettstown, N.J., and ''some of it is driven by the fact we remain an economical treat, something you can do for yourself that's affordable.''
''We see there's still growth for our products,'' she added, which explains the addition of the ''Halloween-specific advertising'' for Milky Way and Snickers.
In the commercial for Milky Way, grown-up trick-or-treaters are greeted at a door by a skeptical girl. Challenged about their age, one adult explains that he had a ''growth spurt.'' An announcer ends the spot by saying, ''You're never too old for smooth Milky Way caramel,'' and the words ''Halloween's better the Milky Way'' appear on screen.
In the commercial for Snickers, a shopper in the candy aisle of a supermarket is greeted by a masked stranger.
''Hellooooooooo, Mrs. Jensen, you don't have any Snickers in your shopping cart,'' the stranger says in an odd voice, adding: ''The neighborhood kids love Snickers at Halloween. Let me help you.''
The stranger tosses so many bags of Snickers into the cart that the shopper, rattled, runs off. The stranger, it turns out, is actually two children, one atop the other, hidden under an oversize coat.
''This Halloween,'' an announcer says, ''nothing satisfies like Snickers.''
The campaigns for the three candies are by BBDO New York, part of the BBDO North America unit of BBDO Worldwide, which is owned by the Omnicom Group.
Another big marketer, General Mills, is dressing up its three so-called monster cereals -- Boo Berry, Count Chocula and Franken Berry -- in new boxes and putting them on sale at Target stores from Sept. 26 through Oct. 31 at a suggested price of $2.50 each -- well below what cereals often cost these days.
The reduced pricing is ''because we wanted to make sure everyone can get in the spook-tacular fun of the season,'' Susanne Prucha, marketing manager for the monster cereals at General Mills in Golden Valley, Minn., wrote in an e-mail.
Beginning this year, the three cereals will be sold only for a limited time leading up to Halloween, Ms. Prucha said.
''Historically, October accounted for half of all monster cereal sales throughout the year,'' she added, ''so we wanted to focus our efforts on this pre-Halloween period that is so important to the monster cereals consumer.''
In another sign of the impact of the economy on Halloween, the selling season began early in many cities, a week before Labor Day weekend.
''The idea is to make sure to find people when they feel they have a little money to spend,'' Ms. Corlett said, regardless of what the calendar says.
There is another potential benefit for sellers that peddle Halloween products so early, she added: ''If it's candy, guess what? It gets eaten before Halloween'' and has to be replenished for the holiday.

HEADLINE: A Florida Lawmaker Not Known for Subtlety, and Proud of It

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE

 BODY:
ORLANDO, Fla. -- Calling voters on behalf of Alan Grayson, the Florida congressman and Democratic firebrand, can require the finer arts of persuasion.
Even Democrats occasionally ask: Must he be so negative? Labeling Republicans ''knuckle-dragging Neanderthals'' as he did last year? And now, running a television spot that calls his Republican opponent, Daniel Webster, ''Taliban Dan'' because of his conservative Christian views on marriage and abortion?
''I tell people you have to look beyond personality,'' said Leigh Doney, 55, a volunteer at the Grayson campaign office last week. ''We're not electing a personality. We're electing a person with specific views on specific issues.''
Mr. Grayson, 52, has tried to define himself here in this swing district that includes Disney World as a freshman congressman who has delivered federal dollars, and a populist hero with the guts to punch back at Republicans. At a time when many Democratic supporters want their party to hit back, hard, he is winding up like a heavyweight. And yet, in part because of his brash approach -- which has made him a top target for Republicans -- Mr. Grayson has been struggling to control the conversation. 
His ''Taliban Dan'' advertisement, which started on Sept. 25, caused a fund-raising boom for his opponent after Factcheck.org found that Mr. Grayson had distorted Mr. Webster's comments. (Though the ad quotes Mr. Webster as saying that wives should submit to their husbands during a speech before a religious group, the unedited video showed him calling for husbands to love their wives.)
Mr. Grayson has also had his hands full battling ads from outside interests. The group Americans for Prosperity, financed in part by the billionaire Koch brothers, well-known funders of conservative causes, recently spent more than $250,000 on ads that attack him and Representative Suzanne M. Kosmas, an embattled Democrat in a neighboring district, for supporting the economic stimulus plan and ''Nancy Pelosi's liberal agenda.''
Another group, the 60-Plus Association, which bills itself as a conservative alternative to AARP, has spent more than $800,000 in the Orlando media market on ads that inaccurately describe the vote for health care overhaul by Mr. Grayson and Ms. Kosmas (among others) as a vote for $500 billion in cuts to Medicare.
''It's not me against Dan Webster,'' said Mr. Grayson, in an interview at his pink house here. ''It's me against the insurance companies.''
In fact, it would be more accurate to say it is Mr. Grayson against almost anyone with conservative zeal. Ever since he said last year that the Republican health care plan amounted to ''don't get sick, and if you do get sick, die quickly,'' he has become a unifying villain for the right. Political analysts believe he and Mr. Webster are in a tight race, with a breakaway Tea Party candidate and an independent running far behind, so the intensity continues to rise.
Last week, when the party establishment and local Tea Party activists came together at a downtown hotel for a rally featuring the political strategist Dick Morris, nothing attracted applause like the mention of a Grayson defeat.
When Mr. Morris told party leaders that ''there is no one in the United States Congress more deserving of defeat that Alan Grayson,'' shouts filled the anteroom. In the auditorium, whenever a speaker attacked Mr. Grayson, the crowd of several hundred erupted with applause.
This had little to do with Mr. Webster, 61, a lanky former state senator who despite 28 years in the legislature delivered a speech so quiet that people in the crowd shouted for him to speak up. The disgust with Mr. Grayson was already built in.
''We need to remove that pig from office,'' said Michelle Malloy, 44, as she grabbed a yard sign for Mr. Webster after the event. She said she was particularly incensed by what she described as Mr. Grayson's chauvinism, exhibited, she said, when he called a female lobbyist a ''K Street whore.''
Women, it seems, may be Mr. Grayson's greatest challenge. And in recent weeks, he has begun to zero in: He is a father of five who often mentions his family in speeches, and sometimes gets teary. His campaign office is filled mostly with signs that suggest women's support: ''Women Plus Grayson -- Progress''; ''Mama Grizzlies for Grayson.''
Even the ''Taliban Dan'' ad was an effort to win over women by suggesting that Mr. Webster would try to impose his religious views on his constituents. Mr. Webster denied this; in an interview at his campaign office, he said, ''I've never tried to impose anything on anyone.''
He said his sponsorship of a 1990 Florida billto allow ''covenant marriage,'' which limits divorce to cases of adultery, would have made such commitments optional. He added that while he is opposed to abortion, even in cases of rape or incest, such issues were being used by Mr. Grayson to distract voters.
''I try to focus on the fact that Washington is broken,'' Mr. Webster said.
Mr. Grayson may have the power to shift that focus: He has raised more than $4 million, much of it from his Web site Congressmanwithguts.com.
The Grayson campaign also has a head start in organization. Mr. Webster only recently emerged from a tough primary, and his operation is still catching up. Mr. Grayson's campaign has already spent around $200,000 on canvassing.
Independents are vital here in a district where 39 percent of the registered voters are Democrats, and just over 36 percent are Republicans. But Graysonites like Ms. Doney -- a tourism manager and first-time Grayson volunteer -- say he can pull out a victory because ''he's a nonpolitician'' who speaks his mind.
''What he says isn't couched in innuendo or subtlety,'' she said.
Mr. Grayson, it seems, will forever see that as a positive.
''My voters want to vote for me,'' he said, sitting in his home office, wearing a shirt popular with Tea Party activists, part American flag, part Constitution. ''My voters are dying to vote for me.''
Correction: October 13, 2010, Wednesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Wednesday about Representative Alan Grayson's bid for re-election in Florida misstated the size of Medicare cuts that an opposition group's advertisement said Mr. Grayson had voted for as part of the health care overhaul. Ads by the 60-Plus Association , which bills itself as a conservative alternative to AARP, say he voted for $500 billion in cuts, not $500 million. (The $500 billion figure has been criticized because that amount will not be cut from current spending, but rather will come from reductions projected through 2019.)

HEADLINE: Chinese Civilian Boats Roil Disputed Waters

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG; Jonathan Ansfield contributed reporting. Zhang Jing contributed research.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- The diplomatic discord set off by Japan's recent detention of a Chinese fishing trawler captain points to what foreign military officials say is a growing source of friction along China's borders: civilian vessels plying disputed waters -- and sometimes acting as proxies for the Chinese Navy.
The number of Chinese civilian boats operating in disputed territory and that of the run-ins they have with foreign vessels, including warships, are on the rise, American and Asian officials say.
The boats often have no obvious military connections, and none have been discovered for the trawler the Japanese detained. But foreign officials and analysts say there is evidence showing that they sometimes coordinate their activities with the Chinese Navy. China's navy is seeking to expand a maritime militia of fishing vessels and to enhance its control over civilian agencies that regulate activities in coastal waters. 
The result is an increasingly volatile situation in waters around China, especially in the contested East and South China Seas. Foreign military officials are now wary of a wide range of Chinese maritime vessels. American officials and a Pentagon report from 2009 warn of potential hostilities with Chinese civilian vessels, based in part on two separate incidents last year in which American warships had tense encounters with Chinese boats.
The Chinese Navy is determined to create a long-range global presence by modernizing its fleet. But the use of civilian boats is part of a different goal -- to better defend and more firmly assert sovereignty over China's coast, its territorial waters and the exclusive economic zones that extend 200 nautical miles off the coast. Using civilians is a crucial part of the doctrine that Chinese military officials call ''people's war.''
Dennis J. Blasko, a former military attache at the United States Embassy in Beijing, said the Chinese military articulated this in 2006 in a white paper on national defense. ''The Navy is enhancing research into the theory of naval operations and exploring the strategy and tactics of maritime people's war under modern conditions,'' the paper said.
In some cases, employing civilian forces ''may be less provocative and with less potential for escalation than employing active duty PLA forces,'' Mr. Blasko said in an e-mail.
The Chinese Navy uses civilian vessels in several ways. One is to command militias made of fishing vessels. Another is to coordinate operations with five maritime law enforcement groups that have some of the same functions as the United States Coast Guard, most notably the Fisheries Law Enforcement Command, which is charged by the Agriculture Ministry with enforcing fishing bans and operates regularly in disputed waters. Some fisheries officials now go out on boats wearing uniforms and carrying firearms, said Bernard D. Cole, a former officer in the United States Navy and a professor at the National War College.
The Chinese Navy could not be reached for comment. An official at the fisheries bureau headquarters in Beijing said that fisheries vessels ''serve the purpose of administrative law enforcement'' and that they did not work with the Chinese military.
As for relying on fishermen, military exercises off the coast of Fujian Province and comments by Chinese officials show that the Chinese Navy has been trying to ''more effectively organize China's maritime militia, based on various fishing fleets,'' Mr. Cole said. ''The maritime militia in 2010 is quite active.''
A Pentagon report last year noted that in May 2008, two Chinese warships were supplied with ammunition and fuel at a designated spot off Zhejiang Province by fishing vessels that belonged to the naval militia.
The latest China-Japan dispute has cast scrutiny on Chinese fishing vessels. On Sept. 8, Japanese authorities detained Zhan Qixiong, a fishing trawler captain, and 14 crew members after the Japanese said that the trawler had rammed two Japanese Coast Guard vessels. The Chinese and Japanese boats encountered each other around the islands known as the Diaoyu to the Chinese and Senkaku to the Japanese in the East China Sea, an area rich in fish and deposits of natural gas and oil. Both nations claim the islands as their territory, but Japan administers the area. Japanese patrol boats usually chase away Chinese vessels.
Mr. Zhan was released on Sept. 24, but Japanese newspapers have continued to speculate on Mr. Zhan's background. Some call him a Chinese naval officer.
Mr. Zhan has declined to talk to journalists. He and his employer, Wu Tianzhu, who owns 10 fishing vessels in Mr. Zhan's home county in Fujian Province, do not work with the Chinese military, said Mr. Wu's wife, who gave her name only as Ms. Chen because of the delicacy of discussing security matters. Mr. Zhan has been a fisherman all his life, she said.
The day Mr. Zhan returned to China, he said he planned to go back to the Diaoyu Islands. About three years ago, an official document circulated in Shenhu County, where Mr. Zhan lives, telling fishermen not to go to the disputed waters, said an employee at a local fishing information center who identified himself only as Mr. Chen. But there has been no such warning in recent years, he added.
''Gradually, more and more boats went to fish there, especially when the harvest was not good enough in other areas,'' he said. ''More boats went there last year and this year.''
Civilian boat traffic rose as China began making bolder claims to the East and South China Seas.
It is not just China that allows or encourages its fishermen to enter disputed territorial waters. In April 2007, four Vietnamese fishing boats were detained by China in the disputed Spratly archipelago of the South China Sea. In July 2007, a Vietnamese fishing boat sank after being rammed by a Chinese vessel. One Vietnamese fisherman died.
Last year, two American warships were involved in prominent incidents in which the Chinese Navy appeared to be working closely with civilian law enforcement vessels and fishing trawlers, Pentagon officials said.
On March 4, the Victorious, an American ship, was illuminated with a spotlight by a fisheries patrol vessel in the Yellow Sea. The next day, 12 maritime surveillance aircraft did flybys of the Victorious. Four days later, the Impeccable, an American ship surveying off the south coast of China, was ''harassed'' by five Chinese vessels -- four of them civilian ships, the Pentagon said.
In these encounters, Mr. Blasko said, ''Beijing demonstrated its will to employ military and civilian capabilities to protect what it considers its sovereignty.''
With tensions on the rise, the fisheries bureau has been eager to publicly cast itself as a protector of China's sovereign interests. In late September, as the China-Japan feud was unfolding, it invited a Chinese reporter from Global Times, a populist newspaper, aboard one of its vessels. The ship was going on a regular run to the Diaoyu Islands. The reporter, Cheng Gang, wrote of a run-in between the Chinese civilian ship and three Japanese Coast Guard ships.
The Japanese ships asked the fisheries boat to turn around. The Chinese vessel replied via transmitter: ''We are a Chinese fisheries administration boat. The Diaoyu Islands are China's indigenous territory, and we are carrying out official duties in Chinese territorial waters. We ask you to leave immediately!''

HEADLINE: Battle for Control of Pistons Nears an End

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON and JOANNE C. GERSTNER

 BODY:
Hard-luck Detroit may appear to be an unlikely place for a bidding war. Yet a surprisingly lively battle is under way for control of the Pistons, a storied N.B.A. franchise also mired in tough times.
Like many franchise sales these days, the struggle for the Pistons the past few months has turned into a stew of tangled family politics, legal wrangling, corporate defections, fears that another city will lure the team away and self-proclaimed white knights promising to keep it at home.
The fate of the franchise has also stirred up lingering tensions between the suburbs and the city, with some civic boosters claiming that the Pistons could help spur a revival of the city's downtown if the team moved there from the suburbs, where it has played since 1978. Mike Ilitch, the pizza baron who owns the Tigers and the Red Wings and wants to build a new arena in Detroit, appears to have the inside track for the team. Karen Davidson, the owner of the Pistons, has entered into exclusive negotiations with Ilitch, according to representatives of both sides. 
Other leading candidates include Tom Gores, a Michigan native and billionaire who made his money in private equity, and George Postolos, a former executive with the Houston Rockets. Any deal would have to be approved by the N.B.A.'s owners. Ilitch is expected to pay about $425 million, according to sports bankers. That would be less than the $450 million paid for the Golden State Warriors this year, but a healthy number given the diminished economic prospects for the Detroit region.
If the team is sold by the start of the season in late October, as ownership hopes, it would join a growing list of recent sales that includes the Seattle SuperSonics, the Charlotte Bobcats, the Warriors and the Nets. The Atlanta Hawks and the Memphis Grizzlies are also thought to be on the market, and the New Orleans Hornets may be sold soon, according to sports bankers.
The Pistons' attendance has slumped during the recession, as has the attendance of many teams, and because they rely so heavily on the beleaguered auto industry, the team's season-ticket, suite and sponsorship sales have suffered disproportionately. It did not help that the Pistons did not qualify for the playoffs last season for the first time since 2001.
The Pistons, though, are part of the N.B.A.'s old guard (having entered the league in 1948, when the team played in Fort Wayne, Ind.) and have been an elite team during the past two decades. They have also been well managed and play in a privately built arena with almost no debt.
The struggle for the team started after the death last year of the team's longtime owner, Bill Davidson, who left the team and its arena, the Palace of Auburn Hills; his entertainment facilities; and his glassmaking company to his second wife, Karen.
Davidson was a self-made businessman who spent lavishly on his teams and recognized decades ago that there was more money to be made in the suburbs. He moved the Pistons from Detroit to the Pontiac Silverdome, then built the Palace, which is closer to his corporate sponsors and season-ticket holders. By using his own money to build their arena, the Pistons have been more stable financially, which has helped lure more than the usual number of potential buyers.
''It's the Pistons in the greater Detroit area at the Palace; to replicate all that today would be an extraordinary undertaking,'' David Stern, the commissioner of the N.B.A., said.
Davidson attended most home games and continually improved the arena, which is considered one of the best run in the league, despite being 22 years old. His company, Palace Sports and Entertainment, runs the arena and two other profitable concert sites in suburban Detroit.
Davidson's family, though, has not shared his enthusiasm for sports. The two children from his first marriage have not been involved in the team, and Karen Davidson, who has roots in the Detroit area, prefers to sell the team rather than keep it.
Davidson sold the Tampa Bay Lightning of the N.H.L. in 2008, and Karen sold the Shock of the W.N.B.A. in 2009 after her husband's death. Both teams won championships during Davidson's tenure.
Selling the Pistons has been more of an ordeal. At least 10 key Palace employees, including Davidson's longtime chief executive and right-hand man, Tom Wilson, left to work for Ilitch several months ago. Wilson now holds a similar position with Ilitch Holdings, and one of his tasks is to develop a new downtown arena for the Red Wings and, potentially, the Pistons.
Palace Sports and Entertainment filed suit against Ilitch's company, Olympia Entertainment, on June 10, alleging that nine former employees tried to steal proprietary information about season-ticket-holder bases, advertising and other key documents. Wilson is not named in the suit.
Karen Davidson, through a spokesman, declined to be interviewed for this article. The exact division and heirs of Davidson's estate remains a mystery because his will is sealed in Oakland County Probate Court.
As the struggles between the Davidsons and Ilitches continue, the team's fans have been roiled by talk that the team could be moved to Las Vegas. Stern said the Pistons would remain in Detroit.
But even idle talk that the Pistons might leave has given Ilitch, a native Detroiter, a chance to cast himself as a savior.
''When I read in the paper there was the chance that this great sports town could lose one of its professional sports franchises, I just didn't see how we could let that happen,'' Ilitch said in August in a statement declaring his interest in buying the team. Ilitch wants to build a new downtown arena for the Red Wings to replace the aging Joe Louis Arena. Having the Pistons as an additional tenant would help the arena's profitability. Ilitch has bought property around the Fox Theater, which he also owns, for an arena, but he would presumably need help from the city, Wayne County and the state of Michigan to build it.
Dave Bing, the mayor of Detroit and a former Piston, might normally be in favor of luring the team downtown, but the city's finances are too shaky now.
While Bing was noncommittal, the Detroit City Council president, Charles Pugh, is campaigning for Ilitch to buy the Pistons and move them downtown. He has written to Stern asking his help and has requested a meeting with Karen Davidson to pitch an arena plan.
''We need to show Detroit is a place worthy of investing in,'' Pugh said. ''Having the Pistons downtown does that. We have to show that this city is not dying on the vine.''

HEADLINE: A Softer Edge For Paladino, If Only Briefly

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE and ELIZABETH A. HARRIS

 BODY:
This was the week that Carl P. Paladino was to become not a man of anger but a man of ideas, of action and, yes, of amiability.
After nearly coming to blows with a reporter last week, Mr. Paladino, the Republican nominee for governor of New York, gathered with his advisers to complete an extensive campaign platform. He posted a video assuring voters that the race for governor was ''not about divorces or affairs,'' but about jobs and economic growth. His campaign scheduled a round of interviews on national television.
''We've left that gutter politics,'' Mr. Paladino told Matt Lauer on Tuesday on the ''Today'' show. ''We're interested in talking about the issues.''
But Mr. Paladino could not stay cuddly for long. At each turn, from a ballroom packed with executives in Midtown Manhattan to the seemingly friendly environs of a Fox News Radio show, his inner junkyard dog kept slipping its leash. 
As a moderator at the Midtown event gently ventured a question about dignity in the governor's office, Mr. Paladino interrupted with a tirade about Sheldon Silver, the Democratic Assembly speaker. ''The man is a criminal,'' Mr. Paladino insisted. ''And don't try to make him look like anything else.''
That comment drew outrage even from critics of Mr. Silver, a powerful lawmaker often cast as a symbol for Albany's resistance to change. Yet Mr. Paladino also drew a surprisingly cool reception during a Monday interview with Bill O'Reilly, who warned his guest that he was in danger of ruining his reputation with voters.
Mr. Paladino replied, ''The people of the state of New York have been maligned, and I'm probably one of the few people with the intestinal fortitude to go and take on these demons in Albany and do the right thing.''
''Alright,'' Mr. O'Reilly said, raising his hand in surrender. ''Don't hit anybody, O.K.?''
The tour has demonstrated the difficulty Mr. Paladino faces in trying to become more than the sum of his irritations -- even in a year when New Yorkers share those irritations and may hunger for an unconventional candidate.
A survey released on Tuesday by the Siena Research Institute underscored those difficulties: 61 percent of respondents defined as likely to vote in November agreed with the statement that Mr. Paladino was ''a loose cannon who doesn't have the temperament to be governor.''
Strikingly, 59 percent viewed Mr. Paladino unfavorably, while only 30 percent viewed him favorably. The poll had a margin of error of four percentage points. ''While Paladino has quickly become very well known among New York voters,'' said Steven Greenberg, a Siena spokesman, ''it is not in a good way.''
That survey followed national headlines about Mr. Paladino's altercation last Wednesday with a New York Postreporter, Fredric U. Dicker, who challenged Mr. Paladino to provide evidence of accusations he had made that Andrew M. Cuomo, his Democratic opponent, had been unfaithful to his former wife. Mr. Paladino retracted the attack on Mr. Cuomo the next day, only to raise the issue again the day after that, suggesting he had evidence of misconduct on Mr. Cuomo's part but refusing to release it.
From the beginning of his campaign, Mr. Paladino has deliberately shaped himself as an unpolished avatar of New Yorkers' rage, from his promises to ''take a baseball bat'' to Albany to the slogan -- ''I'm Mad As Hell Too, Carl!'' -- emblazoned on his campaign buttons and lawn signs. Now Mr. Paladino seems to be struggling with the new him.
When Mr. Lauer asked whether Mr. Paladino believed voters wanted an ''angry candidate,'' Mr. Paladino answered the question delicately. ''I don't think it's anger,'' Mr. Paladino said. ''I think it's people that are very frustrated. And I'm just a reflection of that frustration.''
Yet barely an hour later, at the breakfast forum, Mr. Paladino was back in previous form. After answering questions gamely for half an hour -- and even pulling a few laughs from the crowd -- the candidate began to grow visibly agitated after a moderator asked him whether his thousands of dollars in campaign contributions to elected officials had helped him reap state tax breaks for his real estate ventures.
And when pressed on his accusation that Mr. Silver was a criminal, Mr. Paladino went on the attack, leaning into the microphone and raising his voice. ''Do you understand that the government, the political correctness that's been established by this ruling class in the state of New York, is going to go in this election?'' Mr. Paladino boomed.
''It's going to be gone. They tried to define me by the rules that they created. I don't play their game. All right? I won't play that definition that they want. I'll play my own. I bring my own set of rules to the game, all right?''
And while Mr. Paladino appears sincere in his desire to move the campaign back to substantive issues, his rhetoric still sometimes comes laden with a familiar bombast.
On Monday night, during a radio interview with Alan Colmes, Mr. Paladino opined that Mr. Cuomo ''should be in jail'' because Mr. Cuomo, the New York attorney general, had not yet brought criminal charges against Steven L. Rattner, a financier entangled in an investigation of the state pension fund.
Mr. Cuomo's office reached a $12 million settlement with Mr. Rattner's former firm, Quadrangle Group, in April but has said the investigation into Mr. Rattner himself is continuing.
Mr. Paladino's attacks drew a sharp response on Tuesday from Edward I. Koch, the former New York mayor who has led an election-year effort, known as New York Uprising, to get candidates for state office to pledge to push for tighter ethics rules in Albany.
Mr. Koch publicly clashed with Mr. Silver last month after dubbing the lawmaker ''the biggest enemy of reform'' in New York. But he energetically defended Mr. Silver on Tuesday, after being asked about Mr. Paladino's comments.
''I know Shelly Silver for 40 years,'' Mr. Koch said. ''I disagree with him on different aspects of government. He's not a criminal! It's an outrage.''
Mr. Silver released a statement through a spokeswoman.
''It is unfortunate that New Yorkers are being forced to endure the insulting and baseless hectoring of the Republican candidate for governor,'' he said. ''I will not get into the gutter with Mr. Paladino, nor dignify his comments with a response. Rather, I will let New Yorkers judge his fitness for public office.''
How New Yorkers judge Mr. Paladino may depend on whether he can find a happy medium between populist rage and establishmentarian elan. At the breakfast forum, Mr. Paladino was asked how he, a multimillionaire, could be so angry.
''I reflect the frustration of the people, and I will continue to reflect that,'' Mr. Paladino said.
''In my own kind and gentle way,'' he added.

HEADLINE: Health Care's Uneven Road To a New Era

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Consider what it would be like to have a health insurance plan that capped annual benefits at $2,000. For any medical care costing more than that, you would have to pay out of pocket.
Examples of care that costs more than $2,000 -- and often a lot more -- include virtually any cancer treatment, any heart surgery, a year's worth of diabetes treatment and care for many broken bones. Even a single M.R.I. exam can cost more than $2,000. A typical hospital stay runs thousands of dollars more.
So does this insurance plan sound like part of the solution for the country's health care system -- or part of the problem?
A $2,000 plan happens to be one of the main plans that McDonald's offers its employees. It became big news last week, when The Wall Street Journal reported that the company was worried the plan would run afoul of a provision in the new health care law. In response to the provision, McDonald's threatened to drop the coverage altogether, until the Obama administration signaled it would grant some exemptions. 
This episode was only the latest disruption that the health law seems to be causing. Also last week, the Principal Financial Groupsaid it was getting out of the health insurance business, while other insurers have said they might stop offering certain types of coverage. With each new disruption come loud claims -- some from insurance executives -- that the health overhaul is damaging American health care.
On the surface, these claims can sound credible. But when you dig a little deeper, you often discover the same lesson that the McDonald's case provides: the real problem was the status quo.
American families spend almost twice as much on health care -- through premiums, paycheck deductions and out-of-pocket expenses -- as families in any other country. In exchange, we receive top-notch specialty care in many areas. Yet on the whole, we do not get much better care than countries that spend far less.
We don't live as long as people in Canada, Japan, most of Western Europe or even relatively poor Jordan. Misdiagnosis is common. Medical errors occur more often than in some other countries. Unique to the developed world, millions of people have no health insurance, and millions more, like many fast-food workers, are underinsured.
In choosing their health reform plan, President Obama and the Democrats eschewed radical changes, for better or worse, and instead tried to minimize the disruptions to the current system. Sometimes, Mr. Obama went so far as to suggest there would be no disruptions, saying that people could keep their current plan if they liked it. But that's not quite right. It is not possible to change a system as huge, and as hugely flawed, as ours without some disruptions.
McDonald's offers its hourly workers two different health care plans, which are known as ''mini-med'' plans. In one, workers can pay about $730 a year for benefits of up to $2,000. In the other, they can pay about $1,660 a year for benefits of up to $10,000, The Journal reported.
In a memo to federal regulators, McDonald's executives argued that their version of health insurance ''positively impacts'' the almost 30,000 workers who are covered. And that's true. A plan with a $2,000 or $10,000 cap can cover some modest health problems and is better than being uninsured.
But should the litmus test for American health care really be better than nothing?
Mini-med plans force people to drain their savings accounts for dozens of common medical problems. They also force hospitals to let some bills go unpaid, which drives up costs for everyone else.
Senator Charles Grassley, Republican of Iowa, has previously criticizedAARP for marketing similarly limited plans to its members. ''It's not better than nothing,'' Mr. Grassley argued, ''to encourage people to buy something described as 'health security' when there's no basic protection against high medical costs.''
Dr. Aaron Carroll, an Indiana Universitypediatrics professor who studies health policy, says of mini-med plans: ''They're great if you're healthy, because you feel like you're covered. But if you ever need them, they're so skimpy, they provide very little.'' Gary Claxton of the Kaiser Family Foundation adds, ''They really just shouldn't be considered health insurance.''
The plans' skimpiness is the main reason they ran into legal jeopardy. Under the new law, most plans must spend at least 85 percent of their revenue on medical care, rather than administrative overhead. The McDonald's plans aren't generous enough to clear the hurdle.
At the same time, it's probably unrealistic to expect McDonald's to give workers decent health insurance. Many of those workers make less than $20,000 a year. A typical family insurance plan would raise their total compensation by more than half, destroying the McDonald's business model.
The workers, for their part, cannot afford to buy insurance in the so-called individual market. Plans are even more expensive in that market, because it is dominated by people who desperately need insurance -- which is to say, sick people.
This is where health reform comes in. It tried to solve the problem by creating what policy experts call a three-legged stool.
First, people will be required to buy insurance, to spread costs among the sick and the healthy. Second, insurers will be prohibited from cherry-picking only the healthiest customers, again to spread costs. Finally, the government will give subsidies to people, like McDonald's workers, who can't afford insurance on their own.
Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland all use a system along these lines to cover everyone, largely through the private sector, for less money per person than this country spends.
The recent disruptions in our health insurance market are partly a result of the fact that the stool's three legs were not built on the same timetable. Some of the insurance regulations, like the one on overhead costs, are starting to take effect. But the new markets for health insurance, known as exchanges, won't be up and running until 2014. This timetable has its problems, and the Obama administration will probably need to grant some more temporary exemptions.
In 2014, however, the choice for McDonald's workers will no longer be between a bad policy and no policy. Through the exchanges, they will be able to buy a real health insurance plan -- one that covers cancer, heart attacks, surgeries, M.R.I.'s and hospital stays. Dr. Carroll notes that many families will end up paying less than they are now paying out of pocket and will get more access to care, too.
For insurance companies, these changes won't be quite so positive. They will no longer be able to sell plans that devote 30 percent of revenue to salaries for their workers. They will not be allowed to compete over which company can come up with the most ingenious ways to say no to the sick. Their benefits and prices will become more public, thanks to the exchanges.
The health care overhaul that passed Congress is far from ideal, as I have written many times in this space. But it does represent progress.
The fact that it is beginning to disrupt the status quo -- that some insurance policies will eventually be eliminated and some inefficient insurers will have to leave the market altogether -- is all the proof we need.

HEADLINE: In Capitalism, Sun's Co-Founder Sees a Pathway to Help the Poor

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
MUMBAI, India -- Vinod Khosla, the billionaire venture capitalist and co-founder of Sun Microsystems, was already among the world's richest men when he invested a few years ago in SKS Microfinance, a lender to poor women in India.
But the roaring success of SKS's recent initial public stock offering in Mumbai has made him richer by about $117 million -- money he says he plans to plow back into other ventures that aim to fight poverty while also trying to turn a profit.
And he says he wants to challenge other rich Indians to do more to help their country's poor.
An Indian transplant to Silicon Valley, Mr. Khosla plans to start a venture capital fund to invest in companies that focus on the poor in India, Africa and elsewhere by providing services like health, energy and education. 
By backing businesses that provide education loans or distribute solar panels in villages, he says, he wants to show that commercial entities can better help people in poverty than most nonprofit charitable organizations.
''There needs to be more experiments in building sustainable businesses going after the market for the poor,'' he said in a telephone interview from his office in Menlo Park, Calif. ''It has to be done in a sustainable way. There is not enough money to be given away in the world to make the poor well off.''
Mr. Khosla's advocacy of the bootstrap powers of capitalism is part of an increasingly popular school of thought: businesses, not governments or nonprofit groups, should lead the effort to eradicate global poverty.
Some nonprofit experts say commercial social enterprises have significant limitations and pose conflicts of interest. But proponents like Mr. Khosla draw inspiration from the astounding global growth of microfinance -- the business of giving small loans to poor entrepreneurs, of which SKS Microfinance is a notable practitioner.
Advocates also find intellectual support for the idea from the work of business management professors like the late C. K. Prahalad, who have argued that large corporations can do well and do good by aiming at people at the so-called bottom of the pyramid.
Besides Mr. Khosla, entrepreneurs like Pierre Omidyar, a co-founder of eBay, and Stephen M. Case, a co-founder of America Online, have started funds with similar aims.
But Mr. Khosla, 55, who moved to the United States from India as a graduate student in 1976, has another motive, too. He wants to goad other rich Indians into giving away more of their wealth.
India's torrid growth over the last decade has helped enrich many here -- Forbes estimates that India now has 69 billionaires, up from seven in 2000 -- but only a few have set up large charities, endowments or venture capital funds.
''It surprises me that in India there is not a tradition of large-scale giving and helping to solve social problems and set a social model,'' Mr. Khosla said.
Mr. Khosla is not alone in worrying about the state of Indian philanthropy. Bill Gates, the Microsoft co-founder, who was in China last week with the billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett, said Thursday that he and Mr. Buffett might go to India as part of their campaign to get the very rich to give away half their wealth.
Charitable activities and venture capital investing have been a mainstay for some Indian business families like the Tatas and for technology entrepreneurs like Aziz Premji of Wipro, the Bangalore outsourcing firm. But many others have given very little.
A recent Bain & Company study estimated that Indians give much less as a percentage of the country's gross domestic product than Americans. Moreover, individual and corporate donations account for just 10 percent of the charitable giving in India, compared with 75 percent in the United States and 34 percent in Britain. The balance comes from the government and foreign organizations.
Rich Indians ''are more into temple building and things like that,'' said Samit Ghosh, the chief executive of Ujjivan Financial, a microlender based in Bangalore, ''rather than putting their money into real programs, which will have real impact on poverty alleviation.''
Mr. Khosla said his experience with microfinance had helped shape his views on the best way to tackle poverty. He has invested in commercial microfinance lenders and has donated to nonprofit ones, and he said that moneymaking versions had grown much faster and reached many more needy borrowers.
He said he wanted to help create a new generation of companies like SKS, which started lending as a commercial company in 2006. It now has 6.8 million customers and a loan portfolio of 43 billion rupees ($940 million).
By contrast, CashPor, a nonprofit Indian lender to which Mr. Khosla has also given money, has 417,000 borrowers and a portfolio of 2.7 billion rupees ($58 million) even though it started operations in 1996.
Besides growing faster, SKS, India's largest microfinance company, has become a stock market darling. The company floated its shares on India's stock exchanges in mid-August, and they have risen 40 percent since then.
At current prices, Mr. Khosla's 6 percent stake in SKS is worth about $120 million, about 37 times what he invested in the firm in 2006 and 2007. (Shares of SKS fell 7 percent on Monday after the company said it had fired its chief executive, Suresh Gurumani. An SKS spokesman, Atul Takle, declined to answer questions.)
Mr. Khosla said it might take at least a year to set up his new venture fund. He intends to finance it from his SKS profits and then return to the fund any profits from subsequent ventures it backs.
Mr. Khosla has already been investing in companies that he says fit his model of profitable poverty alleviation. One is MokshaYug Access, which sets up milk collection and chilling plants in India to help dairy farmers. The company says it helps farmers reduce transportation costs and get higher prices for their milk than they can with local distributors.
Philanthropy experts say commercial companies play an important role in combating poverty by creating jobs. But they say these ''social enterprises,'' as they are sometimes known, cannot be solely relied upon to address the many entrenched causes of poverty.
Moreover, as the fallout from the global financial crisis has made clear, the profit-maximizing tendencies of businesses can hurt society, said Phil Buchanan, president for the Center for Effective Philanthropy, a research organization based in Cambridge, Mass.
Nonprofits are effective because they can ''take issue with the unbridled pursuit of profit at the expense of people's lives,'' Mr. Buchanan said. ''I think some of that gets lost in all of the hype around social enterprise.''
Mr. Khosla says that he is not completely opposed to charities -- that his fund may even donate to some nonprofit entities. But he says he is generally skeptical that nongovernmental organizations can accomplish much because they tend to drift away from what their donors wanted them to do.
''I am relatively negative on most N.G.O.'s and their effectiveness,'' he said. ''I am not negative on their intentions.''

HEADLINE: The Terminator vs. Big Oil

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
Sacramento
The Terminator, a k a the Governator, is not happy. And you shouldn't be either.
What has Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California incensed is the fact that two Texas oil companies with two refineries each in California are financing a campaign to roll back California's landmark laws to slow global warming and promote clean energy innovation, because it would require the refiners to install new emission-control tools. At a time when President Obama and Congress have failed to pass a clean energy bill, California's laws are the best thing we have going to stimulate clean-tech in America. We don't want them gutted. C'mon in. This is a fight worth having.
Here are the basics: Next month Californians will vote on ''Prop 23,'' a proposal to effectively kill implementation of California's Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, known as A.B. 32. It was supported by Republicans, Democrats, businesses and environmentalists. Prop 23 proposes to suspend implementation of A.B. 32 until California achieves four consecutive quarters of unemployment below 5.5 percent. It is currently above 12 percent. (Sorry for all the numbers. Just remember: A.B. 32, good; Prop 23, bad.) 
A.B. 32 was designed to put California on a path to reducing greenhouse gases in its air to 1990 levels by 2020. This would make the state a healthier place, and a more innovative one. Since A.B. 32 was passed, investors have poured billions of dollars into making new technologies to meet these standards.
''It is very clear that the oil companies from outside the state that are trying to take out A.B. 32, and trying to take out our environmental laws, have no interest in suspending it, but just to get rid of it,'' Governor Schwarzenegger said at an energy forum we both participated in last week in Sacramento, sponsored by its energetic mayor, Kevin Johnson. ''They want to kill A.B. 32. Otherwise they wouldn't put this provision in there about the 5.5 percent unemployment rate. It's very rare that California in the last 40 years had an unemployment rate of below 5.5 percent for four consecutive quarters. They're not interested in our environment; they are only interested in greed and filling their pockets with more money.
''And they are very deceptive when they say they want to go and create more jobs in California,'' the governor added. ''Since when has [an] oil company ever been interested in jobs? Let's be honest. If they really are interested in jobs, they would want to protect A.B. 32, because actually it's green technology that is creating the most jobs right now in California, 10 times more than any other sector.''
No, this is not about jobs. As ThinkProgress.org, a progressive research center, reported: Two Texas oil companies, Valero and Tesoro, ''have led the charge against the landmark climate law, along with Koch Industries, the giant oil conglomerate owned by right-wing megafunders Charles and David Koch. Koch recently donated $1 million to the effort and has been supporting front groups involved in the campaign.''
Fortunately, Californians from across the political spectrum are trying to raise money to defeat Prop 23, but the vote could be close. George Shultz, a former secretary of state during the Reagan administration, has taken a leading role in the campaign against Prop 23. (See: www.stopdirtyenergyprop.com.)
''Prop 23 is designed to kill by indefinite postponement California's effort to clean up the environment,'' said Mr. Shultz. ''This effort is financed heavily by money from out of state. You have to conclude that the financiers are less concerned about California than they are about the fact that if we get something that is working here to clean up the air and launch a clean-tech industry, it will go national and maybe international. So the stakes are high. I hope we can win here and send a message to the whole country that it's time to put aside partisan politics and get an energy bill out of Washington.''
Dan Becker, a veteran environmental lobbyist, echoes that view: ''Now that industry and their friends in Congress have blocked progress there, the hope for action moves to the states'' and the Environmental Protection Agency. ''Unfortunately,'' he added, ''polluter lobbyists are tight on our heels. They've offered Senate amendments to block the E.P.A. from using the Clean Air Act to cut power plant pollution. Since that failed, they are trying to block California from moving forward. ... If the people of California see through the misrepresentations of the oil industry, it throws climate denialism off the tracks and opens the door for a return to a science-based approach to the climate. It would be a triumph for the National Academy of Sciences over the National Academy of Fraud.''
The real joke is thinking that if California suspends its climate laws that Mother Nature will also take a timeout. ''We can wait to solve this problem as long as we want,'' says Nate Lewis, an energy chemist at the California Institute of Technology: ''But Nature is balancing its books every day. It was a record 113 degrees in Los Angeles the other day. There are laws of politics and laws of physics. Only the latter can't be repealed.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Service Sector Expanded in September

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Service-oriented companies, the predominant job generator in the United States, grew slightly faster in September as demand from customers improved, a trade group's survey showed Tuesday. 
It was the ninth month of expansion. The sector's growth has been sluggish since early summer, however, as consumer spending growth remains weak. Companies that supply services, which include hospitals, restaurants, airlines and banks, are highly dependent on consumer spending.
The Institute for Supply Management said its service sector index rose to 53.2 last month, from 51.5 in August. Economists had expected a reading of 52.
Readings above 50 signal growth, while levels below 50 indicate that activity is shrinking. The higher the number is above 50, the faster business has picked up.
A gauge of future business, the new-orders index, grew more quickly in September than in August, suggesting that demand for services had increased. A measure of how willing employers are to fill vacant positions showed slim growth in September after a pullback in August.
The overall index shows service companies have been expanding every month this year, but not as fast as the much smaller manufacturing sector. That has put a damper on overall hiring. The service sector accounts for about 80 percent of United States employment.
In September, 11 of the industries that are tracked reported growth, while three shrank and four had the same pace of activity.

HEADLINE: Follow China, or Lead?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''Blaming China Won't Help the Economy'' (Op-Ed, Sept. 27), Anatole Kaletsky argues that we've entered a period with new rules for global capitalism, where state intervention in the economy, on the model of China's currency manipulation, is de rigueur. ''If the United States refuses to accept this,'' he warns, ''it will find its global leadership slipping away.'' 
It's hard to see this leading to any good outcomes. The example of currency intervention is instructive: China depresses the value of its currency, effectively subsidizing exports and taxing imports. If other countries respond in kind, they depress their currencies relative to China's renminbi -- and undo the effects of China's policy. There are no winners in this game.
Mr. Kaletsky also talks about government becoming ''smaller, but more effective'' in a new model of capitalism that is evolving. From an economic perspective, ''more effective'' government is not necessarily a good thing. If it is more effective in providing services, great; if it is more effective in distorting the market's allocation of capital and favoring some industries over others, not so great.
Statist economic policies are increasingly prominent, and do require an American response. They are by no means a desired outcome or an improvement to the free-market system.
Louis J. Shamie New York, Sept. 27, 2010
The writer is an analyst at an investment firm.
To the Editor:
''If America opts, for the first time in history, for nostalgia and ideology instead of pragmatism and progress, then the new model of capitalism will probably be made in China,'' concludes Anatole Kaletsky.
For the first time in its history? Nostalgia and ideology are the American way, indeed, the American Dream. Pragmatism and progress have come too, but only as a byproduct. Civil rights, women's suffrage, Prohibition, illegal drugs, deficits and taxes are just some of the public battles that were, and are, debated on ideological and not pragmatic grounds.
Even great moments of progress, like the moon landing, had an ideological driver. This is in our cultural DNA.
After all, it took a lot of nostalgia and ideology for the country's founders to see high taxes as the grounds for a democratic revolution against the world's most powerful empire.

HEADLINE: For Those Living Nearby, That Miserable Hum of Clean Energy

BYLINE: By TOM ZELLER Jr.

 BODY:
VINALHAVEN, Me. -- Like nearly all of the residents on this island in Penobscot Bay, Art Lindgren and his wife, Cheryl, celebrated the arrival of three giant wind turbines late last year. That was before they were turned on.
''In the first 10 minutes, our jaws dropped to the ground,'' Mr. Lindgren said. ''Nobody in the area could believe it. They were so loud.''
Now, the Lindgrens, along with a dozen or so neighbors living less than a mile from the $15 million wind facility here, say the industrial whoosh-and-whoop of the 123-foot blades is making life in this otherwise tranquil corner of the island unbearable.
They are among a small but growing number of families and homeowners across the country who say they have learned the hard way that wind power -- a clean alternative to electricity from fossil fuels -- is not without emissions of its own. 
Lawsuits and complaints about turbine noise, vibrations and subsequent lost property value have cropped up in Illinois, Texas, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Massachusetts, among other states.
In one case in DeKalb County, Ill., at least 38 families have sued to have 100 turbines removed from a wind farm there. A judge rejected a motion to dismiss the case in June.
Like the Lindgrens, many of the people complaining the loudest are reluctant converts to the antiwind movement.
''The quality of life that we came here for was quiet,'' Mrs. Lindgren said. ''You don't live in a place where you have to take an hour-and-15-minute ferry ride to live next to an industrial park. And that's where we are right now.''
The wind industry has long been dogged by a vocal minority bearing all manner of complaints about turbines, from routine claims that they ruin the look of pastoral landscapes to more elaborate allegations that they have direct physiological impacts like rapid heart beat, nausea and blurred vision caused by the ultra-low-frequency sound and vibrations from the machines.
For the most extreme claims, there is little independent backing.
Last year, the American Wind Energy Association, a trade group, along with its Canadian counterpart, assembled a panel of doctors and acoustical professionals to examine the potential health impacts of wind turbine noise. In a paper published in December, the panel concluded that ''there is no evidence that the audible or sub-audible sounds emitted by wind turbines have any direct adverse physiological effects.''
A separate study financed by the Energy Department concluded late last year that, in aggregate, property values were unaffected by nearby wind turbines.
Numerous studies also suggest that not everyone will be bothered by turbine noise, and that much depends on the context into which the noise is introduced. A previously quiet setting like Vinalhaven is more likely to produce irritated neighbors than, say, a mixed-use suburban setting where ambient noise is already the norm.
Of the 250 new wind farms that have come online in the United States over the last two years, about dozen or so have generated significant noise complaints, according to Jim Cummings, the founder of the Acoustic Ecology Institute, an online clearinghouse for information on sound-related environmental issues.
In the Vinalhaven case, an audio consultant hired by the Maine Department of Environmental Protection determined last month that the 4.5-megawatt facility was, at least on one evening in mid-July when Mr. Lindgren collected sound data, in excess of the state's nighttime sound limits. The developer of the project, Fox Island Wind, has contested that finding, and negotiations with state regulators are continuing.
In the moonlit woods behind a neighbor's property on a recent evening, Mr. Lindgren, a retired software engineer, clenched a small flashlight between his teeth and wrestled with a tangle of cables and audio recording equipment he uses to collect sound samples for filing complaints.
At times, the rustle of leaves was all that could be heard. But when the surface wind settled, a throbbing, vaguely jetlike sound cut through the nighttime air. ''Right there,'' Mr. Lindgren declared. ''That would probably be out of compliance.''
Maine, along with many other states, puts a general limit on nighttime noise at 45 decibels -- roughly equivalent to the sound of a humming refrigerator. A normal conversation is in the range of 50 to 60 decibels.
In almost all cases, it is not mechanical noise arising from the central gear box or nacelle of a turbine that residents react to, but rather the sound of the blades, which in modern turbines are mammoth appendages well over 100 feet long, as they slice through the air.
Turbine noise can be controlled by reducing the rotational speed of the blades. But the turbines on Vinalhaven already operate that way after 7 p.m., and George Baker, the chief executive of Fox Island Wind -- a for-profit arm of the island's electricity co-operative -- said that turning the turbines down came at an economic cost.
''The more we do that, the higher goes the price of electricity on the island,'' he said.
A common refrain among homeowners grappling with sound issues, however, is that they were not accurately informed about the noise ahead of time. ''They told us we wouldn't hear it, or that it would be masked by the sound of the wind blowing through the trees,'' said Sally Wylie, a former schoolteacher down the road from the Lindgrens. ''I feel duped.''
Similar conflicts are arising in Canada, Britain and other countries. An appeals court in Rennes, France, recently ordered an eight-turbine wind farm to shut down between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. so residents could get some sleep.
Richard R. James, an acoustic expert hired by residents of Vinalhaven to help them quantify the noise problem, said there was a simpler solution: do not put the turbines so close to where people live.
''It would seem to be time for the wind utility developers to rethink their plans for duplicating these errors and to focus on locating wind turbines in areas where there is a large buffer zone of about a mile and one-quarter between the turbines and people's homes,'' said Mr. James, the principal consultant with E-Coustic Solutions, based in Michigan.
Vinalhaven's wind farm enjoys support among most residents, from ardent supporters of all clean energy to those who simply say the turbines have reduced their power bills. Deckhands running the ferry sport turbine pins on their hats, and bumper stickers seen on the island declare ''Spin, Baby, Spin.''
''The majority of us like them,'' said Jeannie Conway, who works at the island's ferry office.
But that is cold comfort for Mrs. Lindgren and her neighbors, who say their corner of the island will never be the same.
''I remember the sound of silence so palpable, so merciless in its depths, that you could almost feel your heart stop in sympathy,'' she said. ''Now we are prisoners of sonic effluence. I grieve for the past.''

HEADLINE: At Flagging Tribune, Tales of a Bankrupt Culture

BYLINE: By DAVID CARR; Sydney Ember contributed research.

 BODY:
In January 2008, soon after the venerable Tribune Company was sold for $8.2 billion, Randy Michaels, a new top executive, ran into several other senior colleagues at the InterContinental Hotel next to the Tribune Tower in Chicago.
Mr. Michaels, a former radio executive and disc jockey, had been handpicked by Sam Zell, a billionaire who was the new controlling shareholder, to run much of the media company's vast collection of properties, including The Chicago Tribune, The Los Angeles Times, WGN America and The Chicago Cubs.
After Mr. Michaels arrived, according to two people at the bar that night, he sat down and said, ''watch this,'' and offered the waitress $100 to show him her breasts. The group sat dumbfounded.
''Here was this guy, who was responsible for all these people, getting drunk in front of senior people and saying this to a waitress who many of us knew,'' said one of the Tribune executives present, who declined to be identified because he had left the company and did not want to be quoted criticizing a former employer. ''I have never seen anything like it.'' 
Mr. Michaels, who otherwise declined to be interviewed, said through a spokesman, ''I never made the comment allegedly attributed to me in January 2008 to a waitress at the InterContinental Hotel, and anyone who said I did so is either lying or mistaken.''
It was a preview of what would become a rugged ride under the new ownership. Mr. Zell and Mr. Michaels, who was promoted to chief executive of the Tribune Company in December 2009, arrived with much fanfare, suggesting they were going to breathe innovation and reinvention into the conservative company.
By all accounts, the reinvention did not go well. At a time when the media industry has struggled, the debt-ridden Tribune Company has done even worse. Less than a year after Mr. Zell bought the company, it tipped into bankruptcy, listing $7.6 billion in assets against a debt of $13 billion, making it the largest bankruptcy in the history of the American media industry. More than 4,200 people have lost jobs since the purchase, while resources for the Tribune newspapers and television stations have been slashed.
The new management did transform the work culture, however. Based on interviews with more than 20 employees and former employees of Tribune, Mr. Michaels's and his executives' use of sexual innuendo, poisonous workplace banter and profane invective shocked and offended people throughout the company. Tribune Tower, the architectural symbol of the staid company, came to resemble a frat house, complete with poker parties, juke boxes and pervasive sex talk.
The company said Mr. Michaels had the support of the board.
''Randy is a tremendous motivator, very charismatic, but he is very nontraditional,'' said Frank Wood, a member of the Tribune board. ''He has the kind of approach that motivates many people and offends others, but we think he's done a great job.''
The company is now frozen in what seems to be an endless effort to emerge from bankruptcy. (The case entered mediation in September after negotiations failed, and a new agreement between two primary lenders was recently announced.) But even as the company foundered, the tight circle of executives, many with longtime ties to Mr. Michaels, received tens of millions of dollars in bonuses.
Behind the collapse of the Tribune deal and the bankruptcy is a classic example of financial hubris. Mr. Zell, a hard-charging real estate mogul with virtually no experience in the newspaper business, decided that a deal financed with heavy borrowing and followed with aggressive cost-cutting could succeed where the longtime Tribune executives he derided as bureaucrats had failed.
And while many media companies tried cost-cutting and new tactics in the last few years, Tribune was particularly aggressive in planning publicity stunts and in mixing advertising with editorial material. Those efforts alienated longtime employees and audiences in the communities its newspapers served.
''They threw out what Tribune had stood for, quality journalism and a real brand integrity, and in just a year, pushed it down into mud and bankruptcy,'' said Ken Doctor, a newspaper analyst with Outsell Inc., a consulting firm. ''And it's been wallowing there for the last 20 months with no end in sight.''
Mr. Zell has acknowledged that the deal has not turned out how he hoped. But noting a recent upturn in results, he said through a spokesman, ''Tribune has made significant strides in becoming a current, competitive and sustainable media company. The measure of management's performance is reflected in the increased profitability of Tribune's media properties.''
The Purchase An Innovative Deal for Little Cash
When Mr. Zell purchased the Tribune Company in December 2007, he bought into an industry desperately in need of new ideas. And Mr. Zell, a consummate deal maker, had a barrelful.
Tribune, home to some of the most important newspapers in the country -- The Baltimore Sun, The Hartford Courant and The Orlando Sentinel as well as The Chicago Tribune and The Los Angeles Times -- had been battered by big drops in advertising and circulation. According to Mr. Zell, the company was also suffering from stodgy thinking and what he called ''journalistic arrogance.''
''There's a new sheriff in town,'' he said, in speeches that were peppered with expletives, as he toured the Tribune's offices.
It was a message that some within the company initially welcomed.
''Sam Zell was sort of a rock star when he went around and toured the various properties,'' said Ann Marie Lipinski, the former editor of The Chicago Tribune who left less than a year after the takeover. ''People had been living with uncertainty for so long and they hoped something good would come from an owner with a proven track record of success in other businesses.''
Mr. Zell's first innovation was the deal itself. He used debt in combination with an employee stock ownership plan, called an ESOP, to buy the company, while contributing only $315 million of his own money. Under the plan, the company's discretionary matching contributions to the 401(k) retirement plan for nonunionized Tribune employees were diverted into an ownership stake. The structure of the deal allowed Tribune to become an S corporation, which pays no federal taxes; its shareholders are responsible for all taxes.
The $8 billion in new loans used to finance the deal left the company with $13.8 billion in debt. But Mr. Zell was convinced that by quickly selling the Chicago Cubs and other assets while improving operating margins, the company could emerge as a valuable property. It was typical Zell: a risky approach to gain control over a large, distressed asset while minimizing his own exposure, something he acknowledged in a company newsletter:
''I've said repeatedly that no matter what happens in this transaction, my lifestyle won't change,'' he wrote to his combination employees/shareholders. ''Yours, on the other hand, could change dramatically if we get this right.''
His second innovation was bringing in a new management team, largely from the radio business, that, like Mr. Zell, had little newspaper experience, which constituted more than 70 percent of the company's business.
Mr. Michaels, who was initially in charge of Tribune's broadcasting and interactive businesses as well as six newspapers, was a former shock jock who made a name for himself -- and a lot of money for Mr. Zell -- by scooping up radio stations while at the Zell-controlled Jacor Communications. Jacor was later sold to Clear Channel Communications for $4.4 billion.
In turn, Mr. Michaels remade Tribune's management, installing in major positions more than 20 former associates from the radio business -- people he knew from his time running Jacor and Clear Channel -- a practice that came to be known as ''friends and family'' at the company.
One of their first priorities was rewriting the employee handbook.
''Working at Tribune means accepting that you might hear a word that you, personally, might not use,'' the new handbook warned. ''You might experience an attitude you don't share. You might hear a joke that you don't consider funny. That is because a loose, fun, nonlinear atmosphere is important to the creative process.'' It then added, ''This should be understood, should not be a surprise and not considered harassment.''
The new permissive ethos was quickly on display. When Kim Johnson, who had worked with Mr. Michaels as an executive at Clear Channel, was hired as senior vice president of local sales on June 16, 2008, the news release said she was ''a former waitress at Knockers -- the Place for Hot Racks and Cold Brews,'' a jocular reference to a fictitious restaurant chain.
A woman who used to work at the Tribune Company in a senior position, but did not want to be identified because she now worked at another media company in Chicago, said that Mr. Michaels and Marc Chase, who was brought in to run Tribune Interactive, had a loud conversation on an open balcony above a work area about the sexual suitability of various employees.
''The conversation just wafted down on all of the people who were sitting there.'' She also said that she was present at a meeting where a female executive jovially offered to bring in her assistant to perform a sexual act on someone in a meeting who seemed to be in a bad mood.
Staff members who had concerns did not have many options, given the state of the media business in Chicago, the woman said. ''Not many people could afford to leave. The people who could leave, did. But it was not in my best interest to have my name connected to an E.E.O.C. suit,'' she said, referring to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. (Indeed, there are no current E.E.O.C. complaints against the Tribune Company.)
There have been complaints about Mr. Michaels in the past, however. In 1995, Mr. Michaels and Jacor settled a suit brought by Liz Richards, a former talk show host in Florida who filed an E.E.O.C. complaint and a civil suit, saying she had been bitten on the neck by Mr. Michaels and that he walked through the office wearing a sexual device around his neck.
''They were like 14-year-old boys -- no boundaries at all -- but with money and power,'' Ms. Richards said in an interview.
During and immediately after Mr. Michaels's tenure at Clear Channel, three lawsuits were filed contending sexual harassment at the company. One plaintiff, Karen Childress, a senior executive, said she was fired after complaining about receiving lewd e-mail from senior company executives. In her complaint, Ms. Childress also stated that women who slept with male executives at the firm were promoted. The cases were settled out of court. Clear Channel declined to comment on the lawsuits.
On Dec. 11, 2008, the Tribune board was made aware that not everyone appreciated the new cultural dynamics at the company. The board received an anonymous letter detailing a hostile work environment and a pattern of hiring based on personal relationships and suggested that the company was leaving itself open to ''potential litigation risk.''
The letter also suggested that a senior executive and a female employee had been discovered by a security guard engaged in a consensual sexual act on the 22nd-floor balcony. The board took the allegation seriously enough that it hired an independent law firm to investigate it. A company spokesman said the investigation found that the executive and the woman denied the incident and the inquiry could find no evidence that such an incident had occurred or that any harassment had taken place. But a person who worked in security at the time confirmed to The New York Times that a security guard reported seeing the incident. That person declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue.
By September 2008, the historic Tribune Tower had someone new in charge of security: John D. Phillips, a former traffic reporter who had previously worked for Mr. Michaels. In June 2009, a party for management was held in the former office of Col. Robert R. McCormick, the newspaper baron and grandson of the founder, on the 24th floor of the Tribune Tower. Smoke detectors were covered up and poker tables were brought in.
Mr. Phillips posted pictures of the party on his Facebook page, showing Mr. Michaels and Mr. Chase, along with Lee Abrams, a former radio programmer who had joined Tribune earlier that year, playing poker and drinking in the ornate office. The Chicago media writer Robert Feder first reported about the Facebook photographs.
''We are in the office of the guy who ran the company from the 1920s to 1955,'' Mr. Phillips wrote on his Facebook page. ''It's normally a shrine. We pretty much desecrated it with gambling, booze and cigars.''
A New Culture Staff Cutbacks and Promotions
While the new owner and managers went about changing the corporate tone at Tribune, they were also under pressure to service the enormous debt. In his initial tour of the company, Mr. Zell promised there would be no job cuts. But like other media companies caught in the downdraft of advertising revenue, the company was forced to cut staff and slash budgets. Elsewhere, the company introduced promotions that seemed to have been drawn from the radio playbook. At four of the company's television stations, an event called ''CA$H GRAB,'' in which a viewer was led into a bank vault and allowed to scoop up dollar bills, was inserted in the middle of the station's newscasts. At WPIX-TV in New York, the viewers were cheered on by clapping Hooters waitresses, giving the station the appearance of televised shock radio.
Mr. Abrams, who describes himself as an ''economic dunce,'' was made Tribune's chief innovation officer in March 2008. In his new role, he peppered the staff with stream-of-consciousness memos, some of which went on for 5,000 typo-ridden, idiosyncratic words that left some amused and many bewildered.
''Rock n Roll musically is behind us. NEWS & INFORMATION IS THE NEW ROCK N ROLL,'' he wrote in one memo, sent in 2008. He expressed surprise that The Los Angeles Times reporters covering the war in Iraq were actually there.
James Warren, the former managing editor and Washington bureau chief of The Chicago Tribune, said: ''They wheeled around here doing what they wished, showing a clear contempt for most everyone that was here and used power just because they had it. They used the notion of reinventing the newspapers simply as a cover for cost-cutting.'' (As a contributor to the Chicago News Cooperative, Mr. Warren writes a column that appears in the Chicago edition of The New York Times.)
In Chicago, Ms. Lipinski said, it became clear that Mr. Zell was not above using the newspaper as a tool for his other business interests. In June 2008, Mr. Zell approached her at a meeting, saying that The Chicago Tribune should be harder on Gov. Rod Blagojevich. She reminded him that the newspaper had aggressively investigated the governor and that its editorial page had already called for his resignation.
''Don't be a pussy,'' he told her. ''You can always be harder on him.''
In a news meeting later the same day, she found out that Mr. Zell was in negotiations to sell Wrigley Field to the state sports authority.
''It was hard to avoid the conclusion that he was trying to use the newspaper to put pressure on Blagojevich.''
Through a spokeswoman, Terry Holt, Mr. Zell denied he used the newspaper to business ends. ''From Day 1, Sam vowed never to interfere with the editorial content at any of Tribune's media properties, and he has always honored that commitment,'' Ms. Holt said.
In a criminal complaint, federal authorities accused Mr. Blagojevich of trying to trade public financing of the stadium for the dismissal of some members of the Tribune's editorial board. An aide to the governor charged with pursuing the matter reported back that Mr. Zell ''got the message and is very sensitive to the issue,'' according to a criminal complaint filed by the United States attorney's office for the Northern District of Illinois. (In August, Mr. Blagojevich was convicted on one of the 24 felony counts he faced, lying to F.B.I. agents about his involvement in campaign fund-raising.)
Ms. Lipinski said it was that episode and other conflicts with management that prompted her resignation in July 2008, just one month after Scott Smith, the paper's longtime publisher, left.
''I was plenty used to crisis, in many ways thrived on it,'' said Ms. Lipinski, who had joined the newspaper as an intern in 1978. ''But this nonsense was a form of intentional man-made distraction that made the work impossible. I couldn't protect my staff from what they could see plainly with their own eyes.''
Mr. Zell's various approaches didn't slow the company's decline. In the third quarter of 2008, the company posted a loss of $124 million, and the recession made it difficult to sell the Cubs. His purchase of Tribune became, as even he described it, ''the deal from hell'' and the company filed for bankruptcy on Dec. 8, 2008.
It wasn't simply the huge debt that burdened the company; the performance under new management continued to slide. While its television division has since done well in the advertising rebound -- over all, the 23 stations are on track in 2010 to pass $1 billion in revenue for the first time since 2007 -- Tribune's newspapers have continued to underperform the rest of the industry.
Advertising has been inserted into The Los Angeles Times in new and unsettling ways. In March, an ad mimicking the front page for Disney's ''Alice in Wonderland'' was wrapped around the first section and in July, a fake version of the newspaper's section for late breaking news, called LATExtra, was wrapped around the real one, promoting Universal Studios' King Kong attraction, with a lead ''story'' that read ''Universal Studios Partially Destroyed.'' In April 2009, an advertisement posing as a news article about NBC's new show ''Southland'' appeared on the front page.
In July, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, the governing body of the county of Los Angeles, sent a letter of protest, saying that the use of advertising disguised as news ''makes a mockery of the newspaper's mission.''
The ads do not seem to have helped. The Chicago Tribune's circulation continues to slide, with weekday circulation down 9.8 percent in the first half of 2010. The Los Angeles Times is in worse shape, having lost 14.7 percent of its weekday circulation in the period. (Over all, the industry lost 8.7 percent weekly circulation in the period.)
Radio, which was the core expertise of the management, has had a mixed record since the takeover. After bringing in many longtime associates of Mr. Michaels, WGN-AM, the company's well-known talk radio station in Chicago, lost market share in 2009. The station manager sent a note last month to Tribune managers, asking them to call in to one of the new hosts, because few actual listeners were. But a company spokesman said that ratings in the morning were up 20 percent for the month of August.
In an effort to shake up the station, the management jettisoned a sports talk show at night and installed someone with no radio experience, Jim Laski, an Illinois politician who had been convicted of a felony.
Steve Cochran, a longtime midday host who has said he was dismissed as he was walking out of the bathroom this summer, said the changes seemed aimed at destroying WGN.
''This was supposed to be their comfort zone, what they were good at, and they have ruined a radio station that has had an 80-year relationship with its listeners,'' he said.
''This is a collection of carnival workers who are only looking after their friends, giving jobs to their buddies. Blagojevich is on trial and you bring in a politician who has done time in jail?''
The Bankruptcy Creditors Lose, as Do Workers
More than the Tribune's creditors took a haircut: the shares that about 10,000 nonunion employees received in the ESOP deal are now worthless as a result of the bankruptcy, although at the beginning of this year, the company replaced the ESOP plan with a cash incentive contribution. But if and when the Tribune exits bankruptcy, the value of the company will be worth substantially less than when Mr. Zell bought a controlling interest. Under a proposed settlement filed recently with the court, senior lenders, including the Angelo Gordon hedge fund and Oaktree Capital Management, would receive $5.5 billion, while other lenders with less priority would receive far less. The case is in mediation.
''How can anybody say that they have done a good job?'' said Henry Weinstein, a former Los Angeles Times reporter who filed a lawsuit, still pending, that contends that the use of employee pensions to finance the deal was illegal.
''Anybody can make money when you are not servicing the debt and cutting people. Zell and the people he brought in had no idea what they were doing.''
And Mr. Zell? On Aug. 13, his lawyers suggested that if other junior creditors were paid, he should get his money back as well.
Until the bankruptcy is resolved, Mr. Zell's handpicked team will continue to run the company, but it is frozen out of any large strategic alliances or purchases. The issue of who will run the company will remain unsettled until the bankruptcy is resolved. Mr. Zell remains the chairman of the board and is no longer involved in the day-to-day operations of the company.
Despite the company's problems, the managers have been rewarded handsomely. From May 2009 to February 2010, a total of $57.3 million in bonuses were paid to the current management with the approval of the judge overseeing the bankruptcy. In 2009, the top 10 managers received $5.9 million at a time when cash flow was plummeting.
Mr. Wood, the board member, said, ''We think they earned those bonuses. They've done a fabulous job in very difficult circumstances.''
At the time, the court-appointed trustee in the bankruptcy case filed an objection, writing that while the current owners argued for ''shared sacrifice,'' they ''fail to understand what the concept means when it comes to compensating their management,'' and then added, ''now is not the time for yet another round of bonuses.''
Other proposed bonuses on the table for 2010 could bring the figure for management pay enhancements to more than $100 million, and those bonuses are heavily weighted to top management. (Earlier this week, management announced that beginning in 2011, it would begin awarding merit raises to nonunion employees of about 3 percent.)
''You have advertising wrapping around sections and being disguised as news and empty desks all around you, and then you read about these ridiculous bonuses and feathering their nests with severances, you want to scream,'' said Steve Lopez, a longtime columnist at The Los Angeles Times.
The creditors, which also include JPMorgan Chase and the Deutsche Bank Trust Company, have acquiesced to the lucrative bonuses in part because they fear that antagonizing management could further hold up the company's emergence from bankruptcy, according to two lawyers representing creditors who did not want to be quoted publicly during bankruptcy negotiations.
''No one is in charge there,'' said an adviser to one of the senior creditors, who declined to speak on the record because it was not in his business interest to be in conflict with the current board or management.
Mr. Michaels suggested in public statements that his current team was very much in charge. According to the company's monthly statements, cash flow is on the rise and the company has $1.6 billion in cash on hand, about half of it from the sale of the Cubs, which Mr. Zell eventually managed to sell. ''We are just getting started,'' he said in the announcement.
And management still is confident that the new thinking has Tribune on the right track. The company recently announced the creation of a new local news format in which there would be no on-air anchors and few live reports. The newscasts will rely on narration over a stream of clips, a Web-centric approach that has the added benefit of requiring fewer bodies to produce.
''The TV revolution is upon us -- and the new Tribune Company is leading the resistance,'' the announcement read. And judging from the job posting for ''anti-establishment producer/editors,'' the company has some very strong ideas about who those revolutionaries should be: ''Don't sell us on your solid newsroom experience. We don't care. Or your exclusive, breaking news coverage. We'll pass.''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Wednesday about the business culture at the Tribune Company after its acquisition by Sam Zell referred incorrectly to federal taxes on an S corporation, which Tribune became after the deal. S corporations pay no federal taxes because shareholders are responsible for all taxes; therefore, taxpayers do not become ''essentially silent partners in the deal.''

HEADLINE: In Tight Races, Democratic Ads Put Focus on Abortion Rights

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
DENVER -- Republicans have won points with many voters by promising a conservative overhaul of taxes and spending, but Democrats are working hard in the closing weeks of the campaign to convince voters that a conservative social agenda is waiting in the wings, too, should Republicans be elected in large numbers.
Abortion rights is the flash point, being wielded by the left in hard-fought races from New York's contest for governor, to Senate races in Florida and California, as Democratic candidates or groups try to rally their base and attract moderate Republican or independent women -- a slice of the electorate that is even more coveted than in years past. 
It used to be Democrats who feared ''wedge'' issues; they allowed Republicans to cleave off conservative Democratic voters. But this time around, Republicans want to talk about economic anxiety -- widely shared by voters, polls say -- rather than narrow social issues that might frighten off moderates.
The Democratic strategy is at least drawing the attention of voters. But it comes with a risk, too: Does selling the idea that Republican fiscal warriors are social zealots in disguise send a shiver of fear down voters' spines, or make Democrats look like they are avoiding the subject on most voters' minds?
One contentious commercial in New York shows women in a police lineup who, the voice-over says, would be turned into criminals if Carl P. Paladino, the Republican candidate for governor and abortion opponent, beats Andrew M. Cuomo, the Democrat.
In the bruising race for a Senate seat here in Colorado, one ad features a Denver obstetrician in her scrubs, saying women will lose control of their bodies if Ken Buck, the Republican nominee, wins. Another, from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, says privacy is at stake with a Buck victory over Senator Michael Bennet, a Democrat.
The Buck campaign has said the attacks are simply an attempt to change the subject.
''The No. 1 issues are jobs and the economy, and Michael Bennet can't run on that,'' said Owen Loftus, a spokesman for the Buck campaign. ''It's a desperate effort by a desperate campaign.''
Mr. Loftus said Mr. Buck believed that life begins at conception and opposed abortion even in cases of rape and incest, as the ads say, but that his focus as a senator would be the economy.
Few Democrats think abortion alone will turn this year's midterm elections for them; polls show Republicans leading in a generic ''Which party would you vote for the Congress?'' question. Here in Colorado, Democrats say the abortion issue more broadly conveys the message to moderate voters that Mr. Buck does not speak for them.
''People are growing more and more concerned about Ken Buck's policies on the whole,'' said Trevor Kincaid, a spokesman for the Bennet campaign. ''Those polices are out of touch with mainstream Colorado.''
Mr. Bennet, a former city official in Denver, was appointed last year to fill a Senate seat vacated by Ken Salazar, a Democrat who is now secretary of the interior. In trying to tie social concerns to economics, Mr. Bennet on Tuesday unveiled a new agenda to advance opportunities for women, as business owners, workers and mothers. Protecting their rights to safe, legal abortion, he said, was part of that same fight.
But whether Mr. Buck is out of touch, or exactly in touch with his supporters, he has staked out some very conservative positions. He has suggested, for example, that Social Security and health care could perhaps be better handled by the private sector. (Though he later said he opposed privatizing Social Security.)
He also endorsed a ballot measure, Amendment 62, which would confer legal rights to ''every human being from the beginning of biological development.'' That endorsement opened him up to charges that he wants to make some common forms of contraception illegal, including birth control pills, which can hinder the attachment of embryos to the uterine wall.
Mr. Buck, a county district attorney north of Denver who is backed by the Tea Party, recently withdrew his endorsement of the ''personhood'' amendment, and now takes no position. His spokesman, Mr. Loftus, said at least three times in a telephone interview that Mr. Buck did not want to ban birth control pills.
But the new fight over abortion and the voting clout of women also says a lot about Colorado itself -- and its contradictions.
It was among the first states in the nation, in 1967, to loosen restrictions on abortion. Then, in 1984, it became the first state to ban the use of state money for abortions in a referendum.
Women have achieved some power in politics here, but never the top jobs. Colorado currently has the highest percentage of women in its legislature in the nation -- 38 percent -- but has never had a woman serve as governor or United States senator.
New York Times/CBS News national polls also say that the political divide between men and women -- more men than women gravitating toward Republican candidates, a pattern dating back to Ronald Reagan's election as president in 1980 -- is bigger than average heading into November. And between Mr. Bennet and Mr. Buck, that gender gap is immense. A CNN poll released in late September said that men were 15 percentage points more likely than women to support Mr. Buck, while women were 16 percentage points more likely than men to prefer Mr. Bennet.
''This isn't a gap, it's a canyon,'' said Susan Carroll, a senior scholar at the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University, who said the average gender difference in presidential races was about seven or eight percentage points.
But whether the new ad barrage is about women, or abortion, or something else entirely, it has caught the attention of Stacy Gholz, a student who was walking through downtown Denver on a recent morning.
Ms. Gholz, 23, is the kind of voter who could decide the race. She described herself as unaffiliated and undecided, a Catholic, but a believer in abortion rights, brought up as a Republican but married to a Democrat. She voted for George W. Bush in 2004 and Barack Obama in 2008.
''I don't think he has the right to tell a female what she can and cannot do with her body,'' she said, referring to Mr. Buck. ''But I'm still working it out,'' she added, regarding her vote.

HEADLINE: Excruciatingly Helpful

BYLINE: By AUSTIN CONSIDINE

 BODY:
A FORMER dancer of 14 years, Anna Zahn is in touch with her body. To gain more flexibility, and to counteract some of the strain from dancing, she has tried a number of remedies: Reiki, acupuncture, yoga.
But she still felt tight, her body tense. So she started getting Rolfed -- a kind of deep-tissue bodywork that can be so intense that some jokingly liken it to masochism.
''It's not going to massage and lighting aromatherapy candles,'' said Ms. Zahn, a 20-year-old student at New York University, who gets a Rolfing treatment every week or so. ''It's tough to go to these sessions. It's painful, very painful, emotionally and physically. But you feel such a relief when you leave that it's just the most amazing feeling.'' 
Others are feeling it, too. Popular in the 1970s, Rolfing once evoked hairy-chested, New Age types seeking alternative therapies -- perhaps most famously spoofed in the 1977 football movie ''Semi-Tough,'' starring Burt Reynolds and Kris Kristofferson.
But today, Rolfing is experiencing something of a resurgence, especially among younger city dwellers for whom the novelty of yoga has worn off, and who are now seeking more intense ways to relieve the stresses of modern life.
''Back in the day, Rolfing's growth was word of mouth,'' said Rey Allen, a Rolfing practitioner in lower Manhattan, who has noticed an increase in its popularity. He attributes the rise partly to the Internet, which has introduced the treatment to a new generation.
''Over half of my clientele are in their 20s,'' he added. ''Since I opened my practice in the city a few years ago, the average age of my clientele has always been 35. But that has drastically changed since the summer.''
Could Rolfing be one Madonna endorsement away from becoming the next Pilates?
Rolfing is named after its creator, Ida Rolf, a biochemist from New York City who studied alternative methods of bodywork and healing beginning in the 1920s. She died in 1979 at the age of 82.
Dr. Rolf developed a theory that the body's aches and pains arose from basic imbalances in posture and alignment, which were created and reinforced over time by gravity and learned responses among muscles and fascia -- the sheath-like connective tissue that surrounds and binds muscles together. Rolfing developed as a way to ''restructure'' muscles and fascia.
The focus on manipulating fascia is part of what distinguishes it from chiropractics, which deals with bones, and from therapeutic massages, which works on muscles.
That also explains why Rolfing has a reputation for being aggressive, even painful at times. Fascia is stubborn material, particularly if it is marked by knots and scar tissue. Rolfers gouge with knuckles and knead with fists, contort limbs and lean into elbows to loosen tendons and ligaments. Patients, meanwhile, need the fortitude to relax and take it during the hourlong sessions.
Russell Poses, a 39-year-old international equities trader on Wall Street, who started getting Rolfing treatments after injuring his back, likened the experience to ''paying $150 an hour for an Indian burn.'' But the benefits, as far as he's concerned, are well worth it. Chiropractors and years of physical therapy couldn't accomplish what two or three Rolfing sessions did, he said.
Plus, he said he could still feel the results two weeks later. ''It's something that actually lasts,'' he said.
It is hard to find reliable statistics on the prevalence of Rolfing. But the Rolf Institute of Structural Integration, which was founded by Dr. Rolf in 1971 to educate and certify practioners, says it has noticed a rise in student enrollments at its Boulder, Colo., headquarters.
Kevin McCoy, a faculty member at the institute with a practice in Milwaukee, said he had seen annual class sizes swell to 100 from 75 students in recent years. In the mid-1980s, he said, the school graduated fewer than 50 a year. Despite the bad economy, he said, ''our numbers have been maintaining or growing.''
An endorsement in 2007 on ''The Oprah Winfrey Show'' by the cardiac surgeon Dr. Mehmet Oz certainly didn't hurt. Now the host of the syndicated daytime program ''The Dr. Oz Show,'' he says he sees the growing popularity of Rolfing as ''a general perception by the public that taking medications for discomfort is not giving you the panacea benefits that you would desire.''
In that regard, he said he viewed the treatment as an extension of practices like yoga, which also offers relief without drugs. ''Yoga is in many ways analogous to Rolfing because it takes tendons and it stretches them into a position of discomfort,'' Dr. Oz said. ''They're just doing it for you without your doing it yourself.''
Rolfing practitioners say they have also noticed a shift that may explain why younger clients are seeking out their services. It's not just to treat injuries, but also stress. ''Health is one area where we can find a sense of control,'' said Mr. Allen, who has been practicing for about nine years. ''The real trend is that people are starting to look within the boundaries of their own skin for meaning in their lives, and to find a sense of security in the world.''
As with other holistic practices, Rolfing seems to leave the door open for a certain mysticism. Even those who have little use for New Age-type practices like meditation can verge on the metaphysical when discussing Rolfing.
Beau Buffier, a 35-year-old partner at a corporate law firm in New York, says he started Rolfing treatments after he injured his neck and shoulder in a fall. Despite three M.R.I.'s, surgery, physical therapy, a chiropractor, acupuncture and deep massage, the pain remained. Stress from his high-stakes job didn't help.
But somehow Rolfing did the trick. ''It's dealing with the physical manifestations of something that's kind of emotional or spiritual,'' Mr. Buffier said.
He has since gotten in touch with his body in other ways. He began exercising more and eating better. He lost 20 pounds. His blood pressure dropped. ''It's almost as if your body locks up emotions,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Officials Fear Christie Will Kill Construction of Hudson River Tunnel

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN; Nate Schweber contributed reporting.

 BODY:
In his first several months as New Jersey's governor, Chris Christie made it clear that he intended to cut the state's budget in ways that might surprise and upset some residents. But one big project -- a train tunnel to Manhattan projected to cost $8.7 billion -- appeared safe.
The tunnel, planned for about 20 years, had already received pledges of $3 billion each from the federal government and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and ground had been broken to start the digging. But this week, elected officials and mass transportation advocates have been buzzing with rumors that Mr. Christie is about to withdraw the state funds that had already been committed. 
To do so would effectively scuttle the biggest transit project under way in the country, forfeiting the federal money and 6,000 construction jobs.
Mr. Christie has not yet announced whether he will back out of the agreement to build the tunnel. On Wednesday afternoon, he said he would decide ''really soon,'' adding, ''We don't want to hold you in suspense for much longer.''
Other officials were clearly concerned that a temporary halt to spending on the tunnel, which Mr. Christie ordered in early September, citing concerns of large cost overruns, would soon become permanent.
President Obama's transportation secretary, Ray LaHood, was trying Wednesday to arrange a talk with the governor. Meanwhile, New Jersey's senior senator, Frank R. Lautenberg, was imploring Port Authority officials to accept responsibility for any cost overruns.
The frenzy has kept a spotlight on Mr. Christie, whose trip this week to campaign for other Republicans in the Midwest continued to fan speculation that he has his sights on the White House. Mr. Christie has already drawn national attention for the combative stance he has taken with teachers' unions, cutting state education funding and suggesting that teachers ease the impact by giving part of their pay to local school districts.
Now, he is demonstrating his willingness to reconsider the decisions of his predecessors, no matter the cost. The review of the tunnel's price tag that Mr. Christie ordered last month was scheduled to be completed by this weekend, but some advocates for the project have concluded that his mind was already made up. Some said they thought he intended to pull back financing for the tunnel to solve a more pressing problem: the lack of money available to fix up the state's road and bridges.
The state's Transportation Trust Fund, which is financed by the state's tax on gasoline, is running dry. Transit advocates and environmental groups argue that the simple solution is to raise the gas tax, the first increase since the late 1980s. They point out that the state's taxes on gas amount to just 14.5 cents a gallon -- lower than in all but three other states -- and that every extra penny would translate to another $50 million annually.
But Mr. Christie, who had pledged not to raise any taxes, has steadfastly refused to consider that option, leaving the state's transportation commissioner, James Simpson, with few options to replenish the transportation fund.
Mr. Christie said Wednesday that he expected to hear Mr. Simpson's plan for the transportation fund in a couple of weeks. By then, he should have decided whether to keep the state's pledge to spend about $1.25 billion in highway tolls on the commuter-train tunnel.
The tunnel, which was scheduled to be completed in 2017, was designed to double the capacity for passengers traveling between Manhattan and New Jersey. Its planners have said that it would create 6,000 construction jobs, reduce congestion and pollution and spur $660 million in annual economic activity in the metropolitan area. Without it, they said, the region must rely on a century-old, two-track tunnel from New Jersey to Pennsylvania Station in New York that is already nearing capacity.
The project had been supported by business leaders and elected officials in New York and New Jersey, including some Republicans, like Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen, who lists the tunnel as one of his ''key mass transportation initiatives.'' Though the project has been lauded as an exceptional example of bipartisan cooperation, no Republicans have spoken out against the prospect of its suspension or demise.
On Wednesday, Mr. Frelinghuysen said in a statement that he supported Mr. Christie's reconsideration. ''We need to answer some key questions such as, 'Can we afford this project?' and 'Does it make sense?' '' Mr. Frelinghuysen said.
That sort of talk frightened mass transportation advocates, who said that if the tunnel project was halted, it might not be revived for a decade or more. Robert D. Yaro, the president of the Regional Plan Association, pointed to the Second Avenue subway as an analogue. After that project was stopped in the 1970s, because the Metropolitan Transportation Authority was in dire financial straits, it did not begin again for more than a quarter-century, Mr. Yaro said.
''If he pulls the plug on this thing, I think it could be gone for another generation,'' Mr. Yaro said, referring to Mr. Christie.
Mr. Yaro said it was uncertain whether Mr. Christie would be able to use elsewhere the $3 billion that has been pledged by the Port Authority, which is jointly controlled by the governors of the two states.
''He'll have to cut a deal with the next governor of New York to do that,'' he said, ''and I suspect that Andrew Cuomo or Carl Paladino would have some other ideas on how to spend that money.''

HEADLINE: Payment to End Wells Fargo Inquiry

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Wells Fargo & Company is paying $24 million to end an investigation by eight states into whether lenders acquired by the bank made risky mortgages to consumers without disclosing their perils. 
The states said loans known as option adjustable-rate loans, or pick-a-payment mortgages, were deceptive. Those loans allowed borrowers to defer some interest payments and add them to the principal balance. Borrowers could make payments so low that loan debt each month.
Wells Fargo announced the agreement Wednesday with attorneys general in Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Nevada, New Jersey, Texas and Washington State.
The loans were made by the Wachovia Corporation and a California company it acquired, World Savings Bank. Wells bought Wachovia at the end of 2008. Wachovia had already stopped making those loans before that acquisition.
As part of the agreement, Wells has agreed to offer loan assistance worth more than $770 million to more than 8,700 borrowers through June 2013, though that amount will depend on how the economy fares. The $24 million will be used to help states reach out to such customers.
The agreement includes no admission of wrongdoing by Wells Fargo.

HEADLINE: Geithner Calls for Cooperation on Currency to Encourage a Global Recovery

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner warned on Wednesday that the necessary rebalancing of the economy was ''at risk of being undermined'' by countries trying to prevent their currencies from rising in value.
Mr. Geithner, in a speech at the Brookings Institution, said some of the world's biggest economies should ''focus on strengthening growth, rather than risking a premature shift to restraint'' by cutting government spending too rapidly.
His message -- aimed at countries like China and Germany, but also an appeal for support from other major economies -- came as the International Monetary Fundpredicted that the world economy would grow 4.2 percent next year, down from the estimate of 4.8 percent for this year, but that ''a sharper global slowdown is unlikely.'' 
As finance officials from around the world gather here this weekend for the annual meetings of the I.M.F. and the World Bank, American officials are concerned that the degree of cooperation in the recent financial crisis is eroding. In particular, the Obama administration is looking to the I.M.F. to help bring about what months of negotiations have failed to achieve: greater exchange-rate flexibility by China.
Instead of the ''competitive devaluation'' of the 1930s, which exacerbated the Depression, the world faces a threat of ''competitive nonappreciation,'' Mr. Geithner said, citing a term coined by Edwin M. Truman, a former official at the Treasury and the Federal Reserve.
That was a reference not only to China but also Japan and Brazil, which have taken steps recently to prevent their currencies from rising in value.
''Over time, more and more countries face stronger pressure to lean against the market forces pushing up the value of their currencies,'' Mr. Geithner said.
''The collective impact of this behavior risks either causing inflation and asset bubbles in emerging economies, or else depressing consumption growth and intensifying short-term distortions in favor of exports.''
In his speech, Mr. Geithner called the problem a ''damaging dynamic'' and a collective problem that ''requires a collective approach to solve.''
Later, in a question-and-answer session, Mr. Geithner said that ''China will be less likely to move, to allow its currency to appreciate more rapidly, if it's not confident that other countries will move with it.''
China did not appear to be in the mood to be flexible on Wednesday. In Brussels, Premier Wen Jiabao criticized European Union leaders who have called for a stronger Chinese currency. ''Europe shouldn't join the choir,'' he told a business conference, according to Bloomberg News. If the renminbi ''isn't stable, it will bring disaster to China and the world.'' If China were to increase the renminbi ''by 20 to 40 percent as some people are calling for, many of our factories will shut down and society will be in turmoil.''
Mr. Geithner's warnings were echoed, in crucial respects, by the I.M.F., which released its latest World Economic Outlook on Wednesday.
''The world economic recovery is proceeding,'' the I.M.F. chief economist, Olivier J. Blanchard, said at a news conference. ''But it is an unbalanced recovery, sluggish in advanced countries, much stronger in emerging and developing countries.''
As many as 210 million people worldwide may be unemployed, an increase of more than 30 million since 2007, the report found. Three-fourths of the increase has been in the most-developed economies.
In those advanced economies, growth is now projected at 2.7 percent for this year and 2.2 percent for next year -- compared with 7.1 percent and 6.4 percent, respectively, for emerging and developing economies.
Developing Asia, which does not include Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, is expected again to lead the world in growth, with projected rates of 9.4 percent this year and 8.4 percent next year.
The fund left its growth projections for China -- 10.5 percent this year and 9.6 percent next year, the highest of any major economy -- unchanged from July.
The fund slightly revised downward its projections for the United States, whose economy is projected to grow 2.6 percent this year and 2.3 percent next year. The euro area's economy is expected to expand 1.7 percent this year and 1.5 percent next year.
The European projections were a slight uptick from July projections, largely on account of stronger-than-forecast growth in Germany, whose economy is expected to expand by 3.3 percent this year and 2 percent next year.
The biggest economies need to carefully calibrate efforts to restrain government deficits and debts without derailing the recovery by cutting off fiscal support too sharply, Mr. Blanchard said.
''If growth were to slow or even stop in advanced countries, emerging market countries would have a hard time decoupling,'' he said, emphasizing the interconnectedness of the world economy. ''The need for careful design at the national level, and coordination at the global level, may be even more important today than they were at the peak of the crisis a year and a half ago.''
In his remarks at the Brookings Institution, Mr. Geithner suggested that the European debt crisis had caused an overreaction.
''What happened in Europe in the spring was very, very damaging,'' he said. The euro zone nations ''took a long time, far too long'' to agree to support their most heavily indebted members. The result, he said, was doubts about ''whether Europe had the will or the ability to stand behind their members'' and ''an exaggerated shift'' toward restraint in the healthier, bigger economies.
Mr. Geithner said it was critical to distinguish countries like Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain, which he said ''had no choice but to move very, very aggressively'' to cut spending, from bigger, less indebted economies like the United States, which continue to enjoy very low interest rates for long-term borrowing, giving them more short-term room to maneuver.
But he also conceded that it was imperative for Congress and the administration to reach agreement on long-term measures to reduce the American deficit and stabilize the nation's public debt level.

HEADLINE: Bright Spots for N.H.L. As the Season Opens

BYLINE: By JEFF Z. KLEIN

 BODY:
The N.H.L. season opens Thursday on the heels of an electrifying Olympic tournament, the continuing rise of charismatic young stars and a third straight postseason dominated by teams from hockey-steeped American cities. There will be challenges, but rather than symptoms of a league's struggles, they seem to be signs of growing strength.
A rash of concussions was addressed over the summer by a new rule banning blindside hits to the head. 
''We've seen a couple of blindside hits -- shoulder to shoulder and shoulder to chest,'' Colin Campbell, the N.H.L.'s chief disciplinarian, said after a preseason in which there was a clear drop in such checks. ''Hopefully, the players are avoiding it.''
The players union, long rudderless and riven by internal strife, seems united again and close to ratifying the nomination of the former baseball union chief Donald Fehr, perhaps the most successful labor leader in sports in the last three decades. With Fehr in place, union and management can negotiate on relatively equal terms in talks to replace the collective bargaining agreement that expires in September 2012.
''Don has really brought the players together,'' said John Tavares, the Islanders' second-year star.
All teams are grappling with difficult personnel decisions dictated by the league's salary cap. But despite dire projections in the economic downturn, the N.H.L. has had a slight rise in revenue. Without the associated rise in the cap, general managers would now be making far more draconian personnel decisions.
The results of this bright news? Corporate sponsorship is up, and American television has come calling after two decades of indifference.
HBO is fueling the run-up to the Jan. 1 Winter Classic by following the Pittsburgh Penguins and the Washington Capitals in only its second nonboxing ''24/7'' series. And ESPN and Fox are expected to bid for cable rights against Versus, the rights-holder from 2005 through this season. The league's TV revenue is expected to rise, perhaps substantially, from the roughly $75 million a year it gets from Versus.
And then there is the hockey.
The N.H.L.'s 93rd season begins with five games Thursday, most notably the Carolina Hurricanes' matchup against the Minnesota Wild in Helsinki; the Penguins' opening of their new building, the Consol Energy Center, against the Philadelphia Flyers; and a clash of the league's oldest teams, the Montreal Canadiens and the Maple Leafs in Toronto.
The Blackhawks were the feel-good story last season. Led by Jonathan Toews, 22, and Patrick Kane, 21, they made hockey the hottest ticket in Chicago and won their first Stanley Cup title in 49 years.
But within days, salary-cap issues forced them to begin jettisoning Dustin Byfuglien, Kris Versteeg, Brent Sopel, Ben Eager, John Madden, Cam Barker and Marty Reasoner, as well as both goalies, Antti Niemi and Cristobal Huet. It is perhaps the biggest turnover a Cup-winning team has experienced since World War II ravaged the roster of the 1942 Maple Leafs.
Pittsburgh and Washington are the league's glamour teams. The Penguins, led by Sidney Crosby, who scored Canada's Olympic gold-medal-winning goal, and Evgeni Malkin, are hoping to get back to the Stanley Cup finals, which they lost in 2008 and won in 2009.
Alex Ovechkin, the 48th-most powerful man in Washington, according to GQ magazine, will try to move on from the disappointing end to last season.
Ovechkin scored 50 goals and 109 points as the attack-minded Capitals won the Presidents' Trophy as the top regular-season team. But he was also suspended twice for reckless hits, left the Olympics early when Canada trounced Russia, crashed out of the first round of the playoffs when the Capitals blew a three-games-to-one lead against Montreal, and committed the turnover that cost Russia the world championships final against the Czech Republic.
''We have to improve our mentality -- we know we can play good offensively, but we have to play good defensively if we want to win,'' Ovechkin said of the Capitals, although he might as well have been speaking about himself.
The Rangers begin their 85th season Saturday at Buffalo. Last season they missed the playoffs for the first time in five years, when they lost a shootout at Philadelphia in the last game. The Flyers went all the way to the Stanley Cup finals. That made Philadelphia, Chicago, Detroit and Pittsburgh the only cities involved in the last three finals, a big reason playoff TV ratings have been so high after years of teams like Carolina, Anaheim and Ottawa.
But what if Olli Jokinen, now gone from New York, had hit his last shot in Philadelphia last April? Could the Rangers have wound up in the finals?
''You can't think that way,'' Coach John Tortorella said.
The Devils, who have made three straight first-round exits, have been wrestling with the salary cap after signing Ilya Kovalchuk to a 15-year, $100 million deal. The Devils, who host Dallas on Friday, were $3 million over the cap on Wednesday before making roster moves that left them with the minimum 20 players rather than the customary 23.
The Islanders open Saturday at home, also against Dallas. They cannot seem to escape the dark cloud that has followed them since 1993, the last time they advanced beyond the first round. Mark Streit, their workhorse defenseman, is out at least six months with a shoulder injury.

HEADLINE: Market Finds Little Reason to Rally After Big Rise on Tuesday

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER and DAVID JOLLY; Bettina Wassener contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Stocks were mixed on Wednesday after a private sector jobs report renewed concerns about the pace of the economic recovery, particularly in the labor market.
There was little sign of the enthusiasm that drove the market in recent days, when speculation about widespread quantitative easing measures by central banks suggested there would be fresh liquidity.
On Tuesday, that speculation propelled the Dow Jones industrial average to rise nearly 2 percent for its best close since May 3. 
Instead, Wall Street wavered on Wednesday after the payroll company ADP reported that private employers shed 39,000 jobs last month, the first downturn in several months.
The Labor Department's report on the job markets, scheduled for Friday, is expected to show that the private sector added 75,000 jobs in September and that the unemployment rate rose to 9.7 percent. Overall job growth is expected to be flat.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 22.93 points, or 0.21 percent, closing at 10,967.65, while the Nasdaq composite index fell 19.17 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,380.66. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped less than a point, to 1,159.97.
After Tuesday's rally, ''you would expect a little bit of a retracement,'' Uri Landesman, president of the Platinum Partners hedge fund, said of the market moves on Wednesday.
The United States market defied the trend set by indexes in Asia and Europe, which closed higher as speculation grew that the Federal Reserve might soon take additional moves to stimulate the economy after a similar effort by Japan's central bank.
Analysts said that the prospect of easing by the Fed at its November meeting affected the bond market. The 30-year bond rose almost 1.5 points and the yield dropped. The benchmark 10-year note rose 21/32, to 101 31/32, and the yield fell to 2.40 percent, from 2.47 percent late Tuesday.
''The big picture is the quantitative easing anticipated on the part of the Fed,'' said Alan Schankel, director of fixed-income research at Janney Montgomery Scott.
The Bank of Japan unexpectedly lowered its benchmark interest rate to a range of zero to 0.1 percent on Tuesday, a tiny change but a symbolic shift back into an age of zero interest rates.
The Japanese central bank also plans to set up a fund of $60 billion to buy Japanese government bonds, commercial paper and other asset-backed securities amid concerns about weakening growth in the economy, the world's third-largest after those of the United States and China.
The Japanese move, the likelihood of the Fed's quantitative easing and even expectations of action by the Bank of England, which meets on Thursday, have helped spur stocks. The European Central Bank also meets on Thursday.
Traders are also starting to take in the latest financial results, with the aluminum maker Alcoa, which traditionally kicks off the earnings season, reporting on Thursday.
Mr. Landesman said the coming earnings season, the potential for further mergers and acquisitions and the results of the midterm elections were potential market movers looking ahead.
On Wednesday, General Electric said it had agreed to buy Dresser, a privately held energy infrastructure and services company, for $3 billion as the industrial conglomerate seeks to bolster its offerings in the sector. G.E. shares were up 39 cents, to $16.90.
Energy and materials shares were up slightly, while technology shares slipped more than 1 percent.
The prospect for weak jobs data in Friday's monthly national report, as well as the continued news of Europe confronting its own banking crisis, suggested additional future moves to ease monetary policy to some market analysts.

HEADLINE: Spin Art: Rotating a House to Make a Statement

BYLINE: By JOYCE WADLER

 BODY:
Sometime later this month, Mary Ellen Carroll, a conceptual artist who has been lecturing for the last few years at Rice University's school of architecture, will oversee the 180-degree rotation of a small one-story house in the Houston suburb of Sharpstown, a once-prosperous postwar planned community that has suffered economic reversals. The project, ''prototype 180,'' will be streamed live on the Web.
When exactly is hard to say -- a telephone interview with Ms. Carroll, who was at the house, was interrupted last week when one of the jacks broke. But Ms. Carroll, 48, whose work has been exhibited around the world, including at the Whitney Museum in New York, cheerfully resumed the interview earlier this week. 
You've done a lot of interesting things, including having a stolen car dropped into a sculpture park in upstate New York, where it would look as if it had been abandoned.
Yes, the point was, upstate it could be something you could actually encounter. The idea was to take something that could exist and put it where it actually belonged, conceptually. A few years later, they asked me to do another work, and I decided to do the thing in reverse -- exhume it and bury it.
How did you know the car was really stolen?
Because I ended up getting it at a police auction.
Now you're going to rotate a house 180 degrees.How much will this whole thing cost?
That's an obvious question, and not the right one. You have to contextualize it. This is really, really important, in that the whole concept of ''prototype 180'' is a conceptual work of art that will make architecture perform in the historical trajectory. Where I began was in thinking about monumentality, how in the '60s and '70s you had these monumental works of art -- not the public works, but Robert Smithson's ''Spiral Jetty'' work in Salt Lake and Walter De Maria's ''The Lightning Field.'' Then you have the way things shifted in the '80s and '90s, and architecture usurped that gesture of monumentality.
Why rotate a house 180 degrees?
First of all, it was necessary for the building that work was done for it -- it hadn't been inhabited for 13 years. And to have something as a model or laboratory that points to the issue of planning and urbanism and how we live and we work. But then to actually do it and have that gesture of the shift from the front to the back be the visual cue and physical cue in terms of generating a series of questions that one may have, which could evolve or not to the asking of how and why things are done in the way in which they are -- and that everything in the building is going to be reconsidered.
Part of the reason I'm in Houston, and the reason the project is taking place here, is because of the lack of land-use policy, because there is no zoning. And that's the foundation of this entire thing. Policy is a kind of readymade material, and so ''prototype 180'' uses the condition of the urban condition of Houston. Because what's implied in that is categorized as sort of a free-enterprise city where the market determines where things need to be.
So let me get this straight: What you hope to do with turning the house 180 degrees is to make people question the lack of urban planning in Houston?
No, it's to make people engage in the consideration of how they live and how they work. If you see something that is turned around in relation to the rest of the area that it is in -- say, you could have a box of knives, and one is flipped around -- when they are all the same, you don't begin to consider it. But if something has slightly changed positions, it has its own autonomy. It then, in and of itself, becomes some kind of free enterprise, if you will, that goes back to the culture of Houston.
How do the neighbors feel about this? Won't it hurt property values?
I don't see how. This house was boarded up for years.
Did you talk to the neighbors?
One of the things I did in the neighborhood and with the civic association was give a presentation. And then there were also direct conversations. I said that they've known we actually had the property for two years and that it's been maintained. Generally, when I have had conversations, they're very pleased that something is being done to this uninhabited house.
How were you able to buy the house and do this project?
I formed a corporation and went to both collectors of mine and people I thought might be interested in supporting it. I wanted people to invest in the idea and the impact of what it would ultimately be. It was also about being selected to participate in this -- it wasn't some random blanketing of people. I always bring it back to the point of how and why.
And I always bring it back to ''How much?'' How much is this project going to cost?
Probably about $300,000.
If turning a house 180 degrees is art, what do you call a house being driven down a highway?
It's a house being driven down a highway.
Information on ''prototype 180'' is at prototype180.com.

PERSON: Sherman J. Maisel 

HEADLINE: Sherman J. Maisel, Former Fed Governor, Dies at 92

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
Sherman J. Maisel, an economist and former Federal Reserve governor whose research on housing markets shaped decades of federal policy on mortgages, died on Sept. 29 in San Francisco. He was 92.
The cause was respiratory failure, according to the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, which announced the death. Mr. Maisel taught there from 1948 to 1965, and again from 1972 until his retirement in 1986.
Mr. Maisel's research laid the intellectual groundwork for government support of the mortgage market. Well into the 1960s, mortgages were mostly local products, with their availability subject to the flow of deposits into banks and savings and loan institutions. Mr. Maisel found that the structure of the mortgage market tended to suppress home construction during downturns, and that the government could help buffer the economy from those cyclical swings by supporting a secondary mortgage market. 
''His work on housing cycles and mortgage markets was path-breaking,'' said Kenneth T. Rosen, chairman of the business school's Fisher Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics, which Mr. Maisel helped establish.
President Lyndon B. Johnson named Mr. Maisel to the Fed's board of governors in 1965. While Mr. Maisel was on the board, Johnson tapped him to serve on a White House task force on federal mortgage policies. The group proposed allowing the Government National Mortgage Association, or Ginnie Mae, to guarantee securities backed by pools of mortgages and freeing Fannie Mae from the constraints of the federal budget so that it could assist the mortgage markets during times of financial stress.
Those decisions helped create a national mortgage market that relied on bond financing rather than on the strength and liquidity of local banks.
But the proper role of government involvement in housing has come into question since the 2008 takeover of Fannie Mae and its sister company, Freddie Mac, in a bailout that has cost taxpayers billions of dollars. Mr. Rosen said that the sound underwriting that Mr. Maisel had advocated eroded in recent years and that the erosion contributed to the crisis.
Mr. Maisel was at the Fed during a challenging time. As the federal government racked up deficits because of the Vietnam War and the Great Society social programs, the central bank faced pressure from Johnson and his successor, Richard M. Nixon, to keep interest rates low.
The Fed was more deferential to the White House than it is today, and one outcome was a period of rising inflation that continued through the late 1970s. Mr. Maisel was cautious about what monetary policy could accomplish. ''In my view, changes in monetary policy may be desirable, but they should be used only to a limited degree (and far less than in the past) in attempts to control movements in demand arising from nonmonetary sources,'' he said in 1972, when he left the Fed after seven years to return to California.
Mr. Maisel's book ''Managing the Dollar,'' an insider's account of the Fed, was published in 1973. ''It explained the 'secrets of the temple' in a way that I found relevant to my experience here back in the 1990s,'' said Janet L. Yellen, who was on the Fed's board from 1994 to 1997 and who was sworn in on Monday as vice chairwoman of the Fed.
Later, Mr. Maisel helped lead a study of risk and capital adequacy in financial institutions, warning of the danger of letting them make risky loans against deposit insurance funds. Those recommendations were largely ignored; if followed, they might have helped prevent the costly savings and loan crisis of the mid-1980s.
Born July 8, 1918, in Buffalo, Sherman Joseph Maisel graduated from Harvard in 1939 and received master's degrees there, in 1947 and 1948, and a Ph.D., in 1949. He was a research economist at the Fed in Washington from 1939 to 1941, and served in the Army from 1941 to 1945, rising from private to captain and working at air bases and ordnance depots. He also served a year in the Foreign Service, based in Brussels.
Besides his wife, Lucy Cowdin Maisel, whom he met in 1939, he is survived by a son, Lawrence, of Manhattan; a daughter, Margaret, of Miami, and two grandchildren.
Along with his academic and government work, Mr. Maisel served for a time on the Berkeley school board. As its vice chairman, he survived a 1964 recall vote prompted by voter anger over the board's efforts to reduce racial segregation in junior high schools by redrawing school boundaries.
For both the recall campaign and a vote to pass a bond issue, his son recalled, Mr. Maisel encouraged Berkeley students to register to vote, a phenomenon that contributed to a leftward shift in the city's politics.
Meeting Johnson to discuss the Fed nomination, Mr. Maisel was startled when the president expressed less interest in his economic views than in the politics of the local recall election.

A young couple, who grew up in Conservative Jewish congregations, who met at a Jewish day camp and whose lives have been dominated by Jewish interests, sent a wedding announcement to The New Jersey Jewish Standard.
It said that Avichai Smolen, 23, and Justin Rosen, 24, planned to be married this month by Rabbi Joshua Gruenberg at North Shore Synagogue in Syosset, N.Y. 
After much deliberation, the newspaper ran the announcement -- the first in its 79-year history for a same-sex marriage -- in its Sept. 24 issue. Then, in its next issue, citing complaints from Orthodox rabbis and a ''firestorm'' that resulted, it issued an apology for the ''pain and consternation'' the announcement had caused members of the Orthodox community. It promised not to run similar announcements again.
Then, after firestorms from other corners, the newspaper released a statement on Tuesday reconsidering its reconsideration. It said the paper may have acted too quickly and listened to only one segment of its readership, which includes Bergen County and beyond, Orthodox and non-Orthodox.
What it says about Teaneck, a community with a history of diversity, a contentious civic culture, a Muslim mayor and an increasingly dominant Orthodox Jewish community, is worth an entire rabbinical commentary in itself. But coming at the same time as the suicide of Tyler Clementi, a Rutgers University student, it played out like a Talmudic variation on contemporary themes.
Jews may have a reputation for tolerance, but they are splintered on gay issues. Reform and Reconstructionist communities tend to be supportive, Conservative ones conflicted but generally not hostile, and Orthodox leaders, if not all congregants, usually staunchly opposed.
So there was some sympathy for The Standard's plight.
''This is one where they almost couldn't win,'' said Andrew Silow-Carroll, editor in chief of The New Jersey Jewish News, which serves a much less Orthodox readership. Mr. Silow-Carroll said his publication ran its first same-sex wedding announcement in January and received no response. ''The Orthodox community has huge economic clout,'' he said. ''If they put out the word that their members shouldn't be reading or advertising, it could be crippling for a newspaper that size.''
Many others were surprised that the paper didn't figure out the politics in advance and show more resolve.
''The news that your paper will no longer publish gay marriage announcements reflects craven cowardice,'' one reader wrote on the paper's Facebook page. ''Some letters from Orthodox rabbis changed your mind? What did you expect Orthodox rabbis to say?''
''You didn't realize you'd have to have a little backbone when you made the decision to publish the announcements in the first place?'' the reader added.
Neither the Orthodox rabbis contacted nor the newspaper responded to phone calls. And on the streets of Teaneck, businesspeople preferred to speak anonymously, rather than risk offending. Still, there was widespread speculation that the economic clout of the Orthodox gave them outsize influence.
''This decision didn't reflect the whole Jewish community,'' said Rabbi Steven Sirbu, of Temple Emeth, a Reform congregation in Teaneck, where nearly all the other Jewish congregations are now Orthodox. ''It looks like the newspaper was held hostage in some way by a small group of Orthodox leaders.''
Another rabbi, David Kirshner, of Temple Emanu-El, a Conservative congregation in Closter, said that while critics of the same-sex announcement couch their argument in terms of Scripture, the newspaper contains numerous elements that can be seen as impious -- like ads for nonkosher restaurants.
''Make no mistake about it,'' Rabbi Kirshner wrote in a public letter. ''This is homophobia masquerading as religious piety. Pure and simple.''
Mr. Smolen and Mr. Rosen have felt more than a bit of whiplash, but they figure that, in a distinctly Jewish way, maybe controversy could lead to greater understanding, particularly of the way being marginalized or excluded can have tragic consequences. They will sign papers for a civil marriage in Greenwich, Conn., on Thursday and have a traditional wedding ceremony Oct. 17. ''We're very happy about the conversation this has engendered,'' Mr. Rosen said ''and think it's incredibly important both inside the Jewish community and without.''

HEADLINE: Race for Seat That Was Once Obama's Stirs Passion in Illinois

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY; Emma Graves Fitzsimmons contributed reporting from Chicago

 BODY:
VILLA PARK, Ill. -- The prospect of seizing the United States Senate seat here, the one that once belonged to President Obama, is so delicious to Republicans that a party leader found himself dreaming aloud in this Chicago suburb one recent afternoon.
''Isn't that something that would just make your day, to read the headlines on the morning of Nov. 3: 'We took back that U.S. Senate seat'?'' Dan Cronin, chairman of the DuPage County Republicans, hollered to an expo center filled with Republicans. 
''Oh my God!'' Mr. Cronin went on. ''I'd have to lie down! I'm telling you; it would be a remarkable experience.''
More is at stake in the race here than merely the balance of power in the Senate. Senator Roland W. Burris, a Democrat who was appointed to the post and is not seeking election, may hold this seat for the moment, but it remains, in the minds of loyalists of both parties, Mr. Obama's.
And that is adding a layer of intensity and ferocity -- and the attention of the president himself -- in the final weeks of a campaign that has been punctuated by unexpected developments.
Representative Mark Steven Kirk, the Republican who has long represented a north suburban Congressional district, and Alexi Giannoulias, the Democrat and Illinois treasurer, remain locked in a close fight, some polls suggest.
A large chunk of voters -- 17 percent in one recent Chicago Tribune/WGN television poll -- is undecided, despite seemingly endless, harsh television advertising and a constant run of news coverage. To hear some voters tell it, left to decide is a basic question that has taken a central, often ugly, role in this race: Who can one actually believe?
Mr. Kirk, 51, was once seen by some as having an upper hand. He had years of experience and a voting history that could appeal to a state that has, historically, elected moderate Republicans. But then came a string of questions about his descriptions of his own history, and he ended up acknowledging misleading statements about his record as a Naval Reserve intelligence officer.
Despite his relative inexperience, Mr. Giannoulias, 34, has pulled off a statewide election once before, and was expected to benefit from his party alliance. These days, Republicans hold no statewide offices in Illinois, and Democrats control both chambers in the state legislature.
But Mr. Giannoulias's campaign, too, was upended by events: This year, federal regulators seized the bank his family owned, where he had once been a senior loan officer. Reports that the bank had made loans to people with connections to organized crime did not help. Mr. Giannoulias has insisted that the struggles of his family's bank were not unlike those of many Americans whose businesses were devastated by the recession.
The questions and revelations have had an effect on the images of both candidates.
''I don't trust either one of them,'' said one voter, Nancy Melin, as she ate lunch Wednesday in downtown Chicago, ''so I wouldn't feel good about voting for either of them.''
When the Chicago Tribune poll, conducted Sept. 24-28, asked which candidate was more honest and trustworthy, the results were mixed: 35 percent said Mr. Giannoulias; 30 percent said Mr. Kirk; 16 percent said neither; and 18 percent did not know. Ms. Melin, who said she often voted for Democrats, said she was considering not voting in this race.
Mr. Obama's relationship to Mr. Giannoulias has drawn special notice on all sides. Although the White House initially encouraged at least one other Democrat to run for the seat, Mr. Obama is making his second visit home on Mr. Giannoulias's behalf. On Thursday, he is to appear at two fund-raising events (one is a small dinner party). Next week, Michelle Obama is scheduled to come. And others in the administration have offered encouragement, too; on Saturday, Arne Duncan, the education secretary, played in a basketball tournament here with Mr. Giannoulias and told reporters he was a ''big, big fan of Alexi.''
Republicans (who note that Mitt Romney, Rudolph W. Giuliani, Senator Scott P. Brown and others have come here to help Mr. Kirk) often point to Mr. Giannoulias's ties to the president as a rallying cry for their own candidate and as a way to dismiss Mr. Giannoulias.
Mr. Cronin, for example, offered this description of Mr. Giannoulias before his Republican rally: ''A basketball buddy and a pal of Barack Obama, and that's his resume, period.''
Republicans, too, are pleased to remind voters that the seat in question was at the center of a corruption scandal that enveloped the former governor, Rod R. Blagojevich, a Democrat. Mr. Blagojevich, who is awaiting a second trial on charges that he tried to sell an appointment to complete Mr. Obama's Senate term, appointed Mr. Burris.
If voters here are talking about their doubts about the candidates, the candidates are talking about the economy. ''Why would we want to put the same people who created this mess in charge and give them a promotion to the United States Senate?'' Mr. Giannoulias said in an interview on Wednesday, referring to Congressional Republicans.
Mr. Kirk said he believed the race would turn on the economy. ''I'll give it to you short and sweet,'' he told the crowd here. ''I'm the candidate who would spend less, borrow less and tax less to fix our economy.''
As if this Senate seat were not wrapped in enough unusual circumstances, there is another one. Voters will be asked to vote twice in this race on Nov. 2: once for the six-year term to start in 2011, and a second time for the few remaining weeks (yes, weeks) of Mr. Obama's term, which, a court has ruled, must be filled in a simultaneous special election.

HEADLINE: Trifecta Of Torment

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
We journalists tend to cover politics the way we cover sports:
Republicans are gaining yardage on their immigration play! The Tea Party is stealing second base! A bench-clearing brawl over health care! Look at the politicians and pundits mud-wrestle!
So let's try an experiment: Let's treat this midterm election as if it might actually profoundly shape the well-being of our country. 
For starters, look at the Republican accusation that Democrats are killing jobs while leaving the United States deeply indebted. ''Democrats continue to double-down on their job-killing policies,'' the Republicans say in their Pledge to America. Rick Scott, the Republican running for governor in Florida, complains that his Democratic opponent ''backed the failed stimulus bill, which created debt, not jobs.''
The Republicans start with a fair point: Democrats haven't delivered what they promised. The unemployment rate rose from 7.7 percent when President Obama took office to more than 10 percent and was still 9.6 percent at last count in August. The Democrats had predicted that unemployment would fall to about 7 percent by now. That was flat wrong.
Chalk one up for the Republicans.
But would they have done better? The Republicans opposed the stimulus package, and the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that it created between 1.4 million and 3.3 million jobs.
In other words, under Republican leadership, we would have at least an additional 1.4 million people out of work. As FactCheck.org, the indispensable truth squad Web site puts it: ''It's just false to say that the stimulus created 'no jobs.' ''
Remember that in the winter of 2008-9, there was talk about another Great Depression. Even the House Republican leader, John Boehner, spoke of the economy being ''on the brink.'' Now confidence is returning, and the United States has officially moved from recession to (agonizingly slow) recovery.
Some Republicans have other jobs proposals that would create modest numbers of jobs -- but many fewer than the stimulus did. Mr. Boehner proposed what he called a job creation plan, but the Economic Policy Institute (which is nonpartisan but admittedly leans Democratic) estimated that it would lead to a net reduction of more than one million jobs.
So, on jobs, the Democrats did poorly, but by most independent accounts, far better than the Republicans would have. Chalk one up for the Democrats.
Then there's the national debt. The Republicans say, correctly, that Mr. Obama aggravated the debt with the stimulus bill. The latest Congressional Budget Office estimate is that the bill will worsen the deficit by $814 billion over a decade.
But as Andrew Romano, a senior writer for Newsweek, noted in an excellent blog post that helped inspire this column, the Republicans propose other actions that worsen the fiscal situation even more. For starters, the Republicans favor almost $700 billion in extended tax cuts for the most affluent Americans. The Democratic leadership opposes them.
In addition, the Republicans call for repealing the health care reform. The Congressional Budget Office suggests that repealing certain provisions of that act would mean an increase in deficits of about $455 billion. On the other hand, keeping health reform will trim the deficits by more than $170 billion between now and 2020, the C.B.O. says.
There are many other elements in play, but put these big ones together and what do you get, on a comparative basis? The Democrats worsen the deficits by a net of about $640 billion, while Republicans worsen them by some $1.1 trillion -- almost twice as much.
Chalk up another one for the Democrats.
There's a third issue in dispute: which party's policies are more in keeping with our national values? Republicans suggest that excluding the wealthiest Americans from tax cuts reflects an unpatriotic and divisive effort to foment a class war.
But hold on. There's a fallacy there. Mr. Obama's plan wouldn't actually exclude the wealthiest Americans from tax cuts. It would cut billionaires' taxes -- but only for their first $250,000 in income.
The richest 0.1 percent of Americans (who earn an average of $8.4 million) would get an average tax cut of more than $61,000 under Mr. Obama's proposal, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. Under the Republican proposal, they would get an average tax cut of more than $370,000, the center says.
Thus, the Republican tax cut would lead to an even more gargantuan gap between rich and poor. As Warren Buffett has said: ''There's class warfare, all right. But it's my class, the rich class, that's making war, and we're winning.''
I grant that estimates about jobs and revenue are uncertain. But they are not meaningless, and the strong implication is that Republican rule would lead to the Trifecta of Torment: higher unemployment, worse deficits and greater inequity.
That might be more important to ponder this fall than the ups and downs of the mud-wrestling competitions.

HEADLINE: Retrenchment, by the Numbers

 BODY:
''No more stimulus'' has become the destructive mantra of conservative politicians here and across Europe. Britain has vowed to cut the budget of most government departments by 25 percent to 40 percent over the next four years. Germany's government has adopted its own slash-and-burn austerity plan. 
Republicans in Congress have tried -- too successfully -- to block, cut back or delay anything that looks like more stimulus, most recently legislation that would have provided jobs to 250,000 low-income workers.
The enormous cost of these miscalculations should now be evident to all as the fragile global recovery falters. Economies in euro-zone countries are expected to expand by only 1.7 percent in 2010, on average, and 1.5 percent in 2011. The United States' economy is forecast to grow 2.6 percent this year and 2.3 percent next -- better than Europe's but nowhere near enough.
Last week, the International Labor Organization said it would take until 2015 for employment in advanced economies to rise back to 2007 levels, two years more than it predicted last year.
In its most recent economic outlook report, even the International Monetary Fund -- historically a paragon of fiscal austerity -- laid to rest the idea that cutting budgets would trigger fast growth by restoring confidence in financial investors. It suggested that while fiscal adjustment should start ''in earnest'' next year, it said the objective should be to ''achieve sustainable fiscal positions before the end of the decade.'' If global growth threatens to slow appreciably, it said, countries with the ability to borrow should postpone the budget-cutting.
The Obama administration rightly argues that the deficit must be addressed, but with unemployment high and inflation low, the most urgent task is to stimulate demand to bolster growth. It hasn't had much luck getting that across in Congress -- even with cowering members of the Democratic Party -- or to other big economies. (It has even bowed to political pressure and signed on to a premature vow to cut the deficit in half by 2013.)
There is a Group of 20 summit meeting in Seoul, South Korea, in November. President Obama should use that meeting, and the grim figures on faltering growth, to press a lot harder for sustained support of the global economy. He must argue just as hard at home for more stimulus. The deficit must be addressed -- but, first, the economy needs to recover.

HEADLINE: U.S. Turns to Waivers to Address Talk of Dropping Health Coverage

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON

 BODY:
As Obama administration officials put into place the first major wave of changes under the health care legislation, they have tried to defuse stiffening resistance -- from companies like McDonald's and some insurers -- by granting dozens of waivers to maintain even minimal coverage far below the new law's standards.
The waivers have been issued in the last several weeks as part of a broader strategic effort to stave off threats by some health insurers to abandon markets, drop out of the business altogether or refuse to sell certain policies.
Among those that administration officials hoped to mollify with waivers were some big insurers, some smaller employers and McDonald's, which went so far as to warn that the regulations could force it to strip workers of existing coverage. 
At a time when the midterm elections are looming and Republicans have been vocal in campaigning against the law, reaction to the rollout has been closely watched.
To date, the administration has given about 30 insurers, employers and union plans, responsible for covering about one million people, one-year waivers on the new rules that phase out annual limits on coverage for limited-benefit plans, also known as ''mini-meds.'' Applicants said their premiums would increase significantly, in some cases doubling or more.
These early exemptions offer the first signs of how the administration may tackle an even more difficult hurdle: the resistance from insurers and others against proposed regulations that will determine how much insurers spend on consumers' health care versus administrative overhead, a major cornerstone of the law.
Several leading insurers, including WellPoint, Aetna and Cigna, have also objected to new rules requiring them to cover even those children who are seriously ill, warning that they will stop selling new policies in some states because the rules do not protect them from having to cover too many sick children.
''The hardest part of health reform is always going to be the transition,'' said Peter T. Harbage, a former state health official who is a policy consultant in Sacramento. He predicts more insurers and employers will lean on the government to delay or weaken the new regulations. ''I think this pressure just increases until we get to 2014,'' he said, referring to the year that the law will fully go into effect.
How much the administration can, or should, compromise in ways that could dilute the effect of the new law in the next few years is a subject of much debate, depending on the politics from state to state or the economic dynamics in a particular market.
Policy experts say much of the authority to enforce the new law rests with the states, and they say the federal government may have little ultimate control over whether insurers will keep offering coverage in specific markets.
Nancy-Ann DeParle, the director of the Office of Health Reform at the White House, acknowledged that the concessions given to companies and insurers reflected attempts to avoid having people lose their current coverage before the full law goes into effect while meeting the aim of improving that coverage.
''It is a balancing act,'' Ms. DeParle said. ''The president wants to have a smooth glide path to 2014.''
The waivers issued so far include the policies offered by McDonald's to its fast-food workers, typically capped at just a few thousand dollars, sold by a profit-making company owned by Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans. As a result of the administration's efforts, McDonald's says it is ''confident that we'll continue to provide health care coverage for our 30,000 hourly restaurant employees.''
Aetna and Cigna have also received waivers to continue selling limited-benefit policies, according to the list released by the Department of Health and Human Services, as have small employers like Sanderson Plumbing Products and Guy C. Lee Manufacturing. HealthMarkets, which offers policies through MEGA Life and Health and other insurers, says it also plans to apply for a waiver for some of its plans.
Some states, like Iowa and Maine, have already said they might seek additional authority from federal officials to exempt some insurers, at least for a time, because of the potential disruption if carriers leave the market over the new standards on medical spending.
''We have some very small carriers in the state,'' said Susan E. Voss, the Iowa insurance commissioner, who said she favored letting state regulators decide whether some carriers should be given more leeway. The state has already lost some carriers, including the Principal Financial Group, which announced its decision last week.
The new standards may prove a challenge to the administration in its attempt to protect the limited-benefit plans. Under the legislation, insurers are required to spend at least 85 cents of every dollar in premiums on the welfare of their customers, and many of these plans spend far less.
The administration says it has the authority to change the way medical spending is calculated. But the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, which has been charged with drafting the regulations that will go to the Health Department for approval, has so far rejected the notion that these plans deserve special treatment.
A committee looking at the issue concluded that there was no reason to calculate spending differently for these plans, saying state regulators could always request exemptions later if they foresaw too much market turmoil.
Some consumer advocates argue that Congress did not intend for these mini-plans to be unaffected by the new standards. ''If they wanted to exclude mini-meds, they would have excluded mini-meds,'' said Timothy S. Jost, a law professor at Washington & Lee University who has been working with state regulators on these issues.
And even some state regulators, like Ms. Voss, whose state has formally requested a federal waiver to allow Iowa to decide case by case what considerations to give individual carriers, acknowledges that some plans should be allowed to leave the market. ''I don't think my job as a commissioner is to make sure every company is viable forever,'' Ms. Voss said.
The struggle to stop insurers from dropping child-only coverage illustrates the limited power that the administration, and some states, may have to pressure companies to participate. While federal officials have tried to address the concerns by insurers that the rules allow parents to wait until their children are sick to sign up, some insurers have remained reluctant to commit to the market.
While states like California can force their hands by passing legislation requiring any insurer who plans to sell policies in the new exchanges to also sell child-only policies, other states have little recourse other than to try to persuade insurers to stay.
In Washington State, for example, Regence BlueShield, a major insurer, has announced it plans to no longer sell child-only policies, and Mike Kreidler, the insurance commissioner, is trying to persuade the other major insurers to stay. He cannot force them, he said, under current state law. ''I couldn't do anything other than use the bully pulpit,'' said Mr. Kreidler, who was optimistic that he had succeeded.
And politics surrounding the health care law may intrude. In Minnesota, Gov. Tim Pawlenty, a Republican and a potential 2012 presidential candidate who has long opposed the law, has become the target of accusations that he is stonewalling discussions over certain types of coverage. (He has already refused federal money for rate reviews and to set up the 2014 exchanges.)
''We are seriously disappointed that we appear to have hit a wall,'' said Julie Brunner, executive director of the Minnesota Council of Health Plans, which represents the state's insurers. The insurers had been meeting with regulators to hash out the child-only coverage policies.
Mr. Pawlenty's office, however, said it had no knowledge that negotiations over children's insurance had been halted, and a spokesman, Bruce Gordon, denied that the governor had played any role in ending the talks. He said, however, the request by the insurers for a standardized period in which parents can buy coverage was unwarranted: ''The insurance companies' request for an exemption is yet another example of the failings of Obamacare.''

HEADLINE: New Facebook Feature Lets Users Interact in Small Groups

BYLINE: By MIGUEL HELFT

 BODY:
PALO ALTO, Calif. -- Facebook is trying to become a bit more like the real world.
The company on Wednesday introduced a feature that allows users to interact with small groups of people, like their family, high school friends or colleagues.
The move is an effort to address a longstanding problem: Facebook friends often span a broad range of relationships that include relatives, classmates, casual professional acquaintances or jogging partners -- and not everyone wants all of them to see his or her information. 
With the new feature, called Groups, Facebook hopes to encourage users to upload more photos, videos and other information to the site while giving them new ways to control who sees what.
Some privacy advocates welcomed Groups, but others worried that it would give Facebook even more information about users, which it could provide to marketers and others.
In an interview, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and chief executive of Facebook, said the feature, which has been in development for months, was not created in reaction to the recent series of privacy mishaps that have forced the company to roll back new features and apologize to users.
''We think about this stuff a lot,'' Mr. Zuckerberg said, referring to privacy. ''Often people don't think we think about it as much as we do.''
He said Groups was simple in concept but technically difficult. At a news conference at Facebook headquarters here, he noted that Groups was not the company's first effort to let users share more selectively.
Facebook has long allowed users to create lists of friends, but that feature has largely failed. Mr. Zuckerberg said only about 5 percent of Facebook users take advantage of the lists.
Groups allows anyone to create a group and include other people. For example, someone's cousin may create a group for their family and put every family member in it. In that way, Facebook contends that if even a small percentage of users create groups, most people on Facebook will end up in several groups.
''We think this is going to be a pretty fundamental shift for how people use Facebook,'' Mr. Zuckerberg said. ''The amount of sharing will go up massively and will be completely additive.''
Once a group is created, users can upload information only to that group, and can communicate with everyone in the group simultaneously through online chat.
Mr. Zuckerberg said that other applications and services that use Facebook's technology would be able to use Groups, and that Groups would help improve other parts of Facebook.
''Knowing the groups you are part of helps us understand the people who are most important to you, and that can help us rank items in the news feed,'' he said.
Augie Ray, an analyst with Forrester Research, called Groups ''a big step forward to allow Facebook to reflect the same social norms that we have in the real world.''
He added: ''In the real world, we don't shout one thing to everyone that we know. With Groups, you have this opportunity to begin to control who hears what.''
Larry Magid, co-director of ConnectSafely.org, a nonprofit group focused on online safety for children, said Groups could protect privacy. ''But there is the danger of a false sense of security,'' said Mr. Magid, whose organization receives some financial support from Facebook and other technology companies. Mr. Magid said a group member could deliberately or inadvertently allow a stranger into a group, potentially exposing information in the group to an outsider.
Mr. Zuckerberg said he thought the system would police itself because everyone in the group would be notified when a new member joins and would flag someone who does not belong.
But Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, called the new service ''double-edged.''
''Yes, it's good to be able to segment posts for particular friends,'' he said. ''But you will also be revealing information to Facebook about the basis of your online connections.''
Mr. Rotenberg said he worried about how Facebook would use that information.
On Wednesday Facebook also introduced two other services: one to allow users to download all their Facebook information into one file, and another to let people monitor how third-party applications gain access to their personal data.

HEADLINE: Run for a Seat Thought Safe Turns Into a Battle

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

 BODY:
CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- Gov. Joe Manchin III, the Democratic candidate for the Senate here, could barely contain his frustration during an interview at the Capitol.
He complained that his Republican opponent was unjustly calling him a tool of President Obama, and he jumped up to show a visitor a photograph of himself taken with President George W. Bush in the Oval Office.
''Obama has never invited me to the Oval Office, yet we're supposed to be joined at the hip,'' he said.
Mr. Manchin was widely considered to be a shoo-in when he decided last summer to try for the Senate -- one safe bet, at least, in the Democrats' struggle to keep control of Congress. 
But this is 2010 and to almost everyone's surprise, he is in a close and bitter battle to fill the last two years of the term of Senator Robert C. Byrd, who died this year. Some experts say the political complexion of the Senate could well be decided here in West Virginia.
Mr. Manchin, a smooth talker who can eerily resemble Bill Clinton, finds himself scrambling against John Raese, a wealthy industrialist and unabashed free-marketer who is working to tar him with the sins of President Obama.
In a flurry of attack ads, Mr. Raese has tried to make the race a referendum on what he calls President Obama's ''socialist,'' antibusiness policies
The national Republican Party has smelled blood and is spending millions on television ads here as part of its drive to retake the Senate. One new ad shows men in baseball caps predicting that Mr. Manchin will transform into ''Washington Joe,'' declaring, ''We've got to stop Obama.''
Mr. Manchin thought he had punched all the right buttons in this state with a Democratic majority but conservative values. He won his second term as governor in 2008 with 70 percent of the vote and has garnered praise for fiscal responsibility; even Mr. Raese calls him a good governor. He has been endorsed by the Chamber of Commerce, the National Rifle Association and both the coal industry and the mine workers.
Mr. Manchin is highlighting his conservative credentials and record of independence and he has accused his opponent of waging a campaign of ''fear and smear.'' But the anti-Obama message appears to be resonating with some residents -- perhaps the same voters who gave the state to Senator John McCain and President Bush in the last three presidential elections.
''Manchin has been a great governor, but I'm going to vote for Raese,'' said Jeff Whittington, 41, a tire distributor in Charleston. ''I think Manchin will get to the Senate and be a rubber stamp for Obama,'' he said, repeating Mr. Raese's message almost word for word.
In a state where coal is seen as the fount of prosperity, Mr. Raese has seized on what he calls ambiguous statements by Mr. Manchin on proposals for a cap-and-trade system to reduce greenhouse gases. Mr. Manchin now speaks clearly on the issue: he is firmly against cap-and-trade and a carbon tax, he emphasized in the interview.
On Wednesday, Mr. Manchin had an opportunity to underscore his support for coal and to distance himself from the president. With the head of the coal producers' association at his side in the state Capitol, he announced that the state was suing two federal agencies, seeking to reverse the stricter controls on mountain-top coal mining adopted in 2009 by the Obama administration.
Discussing the suit against the Environmental Protection Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers, Mr. Manchin said that the more stringent procedures were unlawful and had harmed the state by slowing new mining projects to a trickle, and he accused the Obama administration of trying ''to destroy our coal industry and way of life.''
The E.P.A. responded that its actions were legally and scientifically sound.
Mr. Manchin, independent experts and even the West Virginia Coal Association have taken exception to a Raese ad accusing Mr. Manchin of passing a state law that ''eliminates 25 percent of coal usage in our power plants.''
In fact, the law calls for progress in new energy technologies that include cleaner coal, and it had the support of the industry.
Mr. Raese has also lambasted the governor for past statements welcoming the Obama health plan; Mr. Manchin says that some core elements of the plan, like protecting children's coverage, are good but that others should be repealed. Mr. Raese calls the health plan ''pure, unadulterated socialism'' that should be discarded entirely, a message that appeals to many small-business owners.
Mr. Raese is a brawny and self-confident man who has run unsuccessfully for the Senate and for governor before and now feels currents flowing his way. ''How do you put together a business plan when you have Obamacare facing you, when you've got cap-and-trade facing you?'' he asked in an interview at the Republican office in Morgantown, his home base.
Mr. Raese runs limestone mines and a steel-fabrication company and is part owner of a radio network and a newspaper. He has at least three homes around the country, and his wife lives in their home in Palm Beach, Fla., while he has kept his residence in West Virginia.
While Mr. Raese's anti-Washington message has wide appeal, his unequivocal support for Nafta and free trade and his opposition to unions may not help him in a state with a blue-collar heritage. Mr. Manchin's campaign has run ads featuring Mr. Raese boasting about his inherited wealth and highlighting his opposition to minimum wages and other worker protections.
In interviews across the state, some residents said that while Mr. Raese can seem arrogant, they admired his record of creating jobs and were ready to send a new face to Washington rather than elect a man they see as a career politician.
The only polls published so far were automated -- done without personal interviews -- and are not widely accepted as reliable. But private polling by both camps indicates an unexpectedly close race.
Ford Frances, 53, a lawyer in Charleston, said he likes Mr. Manchin as governor -- Mr. Manchin will retain his job if he loses the Senate race -- but that he is leaning toward voting for Mr. Raese because he worries about a skyrocketing federal deficit and thinks government has too big a role in the economy.
Others, including Cheryl Bonner, 64, of Fairmont, said they thought it was unfair to paint Mr. Manchin with the excesses of Washington. ''He's been for West Virginia, and I'm leaning toward voting for him,'' said Ms. Bonner, who had to start working again, as a store clerk, because she and her husband's Social Security and pension checks did not cover the bills. She hopes that retirees will be protected, whoever wins, she said.
Some residents said Mr. Manchin was just unlucky to be running for national office this year. ''Probably at any other time he'd have gotten my vote,'' said a 51-year-old credit analyst in Charleston, an economic conservative who voted for Mr. Manchin in 2008 but is troubled by the administration's economic policies.
''Putting him in that Senate seat would enhance the Democrats' position,'' said the man, who declined to give his name because his company has dealings with the governor's office. ''We'd rather keep him here as governor.''

HEADLINE: Voter Disgust Isn't Just About Issues

BYLINE: By MATT BAI

 BODY:
KEANSBURG, N.J. -- If you tune in to any of this week's candidate debates around the country, or watch any of the ads that are beginning to dominate the airwaves, you will hear that next month's midterm elections are about all the things you probably thought they were about: job losses and federal spending, the health care law and the Obama agenda.
And yet, if Democrats lose their grip on Congress in November, President Obama will become the third consecutive president to see his party tossed from power on his watch -- a sequence that has never happened before in the country's tumultuous political history. This suggests that however much the issues of the moment may seem to be defining these elections, there are some deeper forces at work, too. 
A conversation among a group of independent voters in this working-class town may illuminate at least one such longer-term trend.
The fast growth in the number of independent voters -- a broad category that includes those who choose not to register with a major party even though they tend to identify with one more than the other, as well as a lot who are skeptical of both -- has been making American politics more volatile. According to a Pew Center poll a few weeks ago, the Republican advantage at the moment is mostly grounded in the party's 13-point lead among independents, which is about the same margin by which those voters supported Democratic candidates in 2006 and Mr. Obama in 2008.
In other words, independent voters have tended to side with whichever party can legitimately claim not to be in charge at the moment, and ideology doesn't have a whole lot to do with it.
This tends to make strategists in both parties insane, since they spend most of their time trying to draw out the contrasts between the two parties, and it seems to them that the least the voters could do is pick a side and stick with it.
Democratic and Republican pollsters try to understand these voters by trapping groups of them behind panels of two-way mirrors and asking them lots of multiple-choice questions about the parties and the issues. Whom do they trust to handle the economy? Who stands up more to the ''special interests?'' That kind of thing.
But three New York consultants who specialize in corporate marketing, taking on tasks like predicting the behavior of shoppers in supermarkets, have been experimenting with a different approach. The three -- Jeff Levine, a pollster who has worked for Democratic candidates, and the marketing consultants Claire Tondreau and Christopher Brace -- have been convening small groups of self-identified independent voters who are friends or relatives of one another for focus groups in a participant's living room.
No campaign or client is sponsoring the research, and no one is looking to ''move'' the voters with slogans or ad scripts. In fact, very little, if anything, is even mentioned about partisan politics. Instead, the facilitator asks the half-dozen or so voters to invent their own countries and to compare their idealized versions with the country they actually live in.
The focus group that met here in New Jersey on Monday included a bartender, a lawyer and a school bus driver. The dominant theme of the discussion, in which jobs and taxes came up only in passing, seemed to be the larger breakdown of civil society -- the disappearance of common courtesy, the relentless stream of data from digital devices, the proliferation of lawsuits and the insidious influence of media on their children.
One woman described a food fight at the middle school that left a mess school employees were obliged to clean up, presumably because the children couldn't be subjected to physical labor. A man complained about drivers who had grown increasingly hostile and inconsiderate on the roads, which drew nods of assent all around. Another described the Internet as just plain ''bad.''
The economy was discussed mostly in connection with these other stresses. ''We all think that if we had a lot of money,'' one woman said, ''everything would slow down and we could enjoy ourselves.''
These voters did not hate politicians. They simply saw both parties, along with the news media and big business, as symptoms of the larger societal ailment. And this underlying perception, that politicians in Washington conduct themselves just as childishly and with the same lack of accountability as the students throwing chicken casserole in the lunchroom, may well be the principal emotion behind the electorate's propensity to vote out whoever holds power.
Bill Clinton certainly thought so, which is why his rhetorical emphasis on personal responsibility resonated with many independent voters. But as president, Mr. Clinton immediately found himself pulled into polarizing debates (gays in the military, ''Hillarycare,'' and so on) that contributed to his party's undoing in the 1994 midterm elections. The same thing ultimately happened to George W. Bush, who promised a return to civility and core values and ended up running a White House in which every issue, from war to welfare, was heavily politicized. Now the tide threatens to swamp Mr. Obama, whose stirring call to ''put away childish things'' seems 100 years in the past.
Modern presidents win elections by promising to reform Washington, to make it more ennobling and more responsive to Americans overwhelmed by the speed of change. But once they are elected, they find themselves sucked into the capital's partisan culture, caught up in familiar debates while the people who supported them struggle with a growing sense of chaos. And so the voters rebel again.

HEADLINE: Rampant Fraud Threatens China's Brisk Ascent

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS; Li Bibo and Zhang Jing contributed research.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- No one disputes Zhang Wuben's talents as a salesman. Through television shows, DVDs and a best-selling book, he convinced millions of people that raw eggplant and immense quantities of mung beans could cure lupus, diabetes, depression and cancer.
For $450, seriously ill patients could buy a 10-minute consultation and a prescription -- except Mr. Zhang, one of the most popular practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine, was booked through 2012.
But when the price of mung beans skyrocketed this spring, Chinese journalists began digging deeper. They learned that contrary to his claims, Mr. Zhang, 47, was not from a long line of doctors (his father was a weaver). Nor did he earn a degree from Beijing Medical University (his only formal education, it turned out, was the brief correspondence course he took after losing his job at a textile mill).
The exposure of Mr. Zhang's faked credentials provoked a fresh round of hand-wringing over what many scholars and Chinese complain are the dishonest practices that permeate society, including students who cheat on college entrance exams, scholars who promote fake or unoriginal research, and dairy companies that sell poisoned milk to infants. 
The most recent string of revelations has been bracing. After a plane crash in August killed 42 people in northeast China, officials discovered that 100 pilots who worked for the airline's parent company had falsified their flying histories. Then there was the padded resume of Tang Jun, the millionaire former head of Microsoft China and something of a national hero, who falsely claimed to have received a doctorate from the California Institute of Technology.
Few countries are immune to high-profile frauds. Illegal doping in sports and malfeasance on Wall Street are running scandals in the United States. But in China, fakery in one area in particular -- education and scientific research -- is pervasive enough that many here worry it could make it harder for the country to climb the next rung on the economic ladder.
A Lack of Integrity
China devotes significant resources to building a world-class education system and pioneering research in competitive industries and sciences, and has had notable successes in network computing, clean energy, and military technology. But a lack of integrity among researchers is hindering China's potential and harming collaboration between Chinese scholars and their international counterparts, scholars in China and abroad say.
''If we don't change our ways, we will be excluded from the global academic community,'' said Zhang Ming, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing. ''We need to focus on seeking truth, not serving the agenda of some bureaucrat or satisfying the desire for personal profit.''
Pressure on scholars by administrators of state-run universities to earn journal citations -- a measure of innovation -- has produced a deluge of plagiarized or fabricated research. In December, a British journal that specializes in crystal formations announced that it was withdrawing more than 70 papers by Chinese authors whose research was of questionable originality or rigor.
In an editorial published earlier this year, The Lancet, the British medical journal, warned that faked or plagiarized research posed a threat to President Hu Jintao's vow to make China a ''research superpower'' by 2020.
''Clearly, China's government needs to take this episode as a cue to reinvigorate standards for teaching research ethics and for the conduct of the research itself,'' the editorial said. Last month a collection of scientific journals published by Zhejiang University in Hangzhou reignited the firestorm by publicizing results from a 20-month experiment with software that detects plagiarism. The software, called CrossCheck, rejected nearly a third of all submissions on suspicion that the content was pirated from previously published research. In some cases, more than 80 percent of a paper's content was deemed unoriginal.
The journals' editor, Zhang Yuehong, emphasized that not all the flawed papers originated in China, although she declined to reveal the breakdown of submissions. ''Some were from South Korea, India and Iran,'' she said.
The journals, which specialize in medicine, physics, engineering and computer science, were the first in China to use the software. For the moment they are the only ones to do so, Ms. Zhang said.
Plagiarism and Fakery
Her findings are not surprising if one considers the results of a recent government study in which a third of the 6,000 scientists at six of the nation's top institutions admitted they had engaged in plagiarism or the outright fabrication of research data. In another study of 32,000 scientists last summer by the China Association for Science and Technology, more than 55 percent said they knew someone guilty of academic fraud.
Fang Shimin, a muckraking writer who has become a well-known advocate for academic integrity, said the problem started with the state-run university system, where politically appointed bureaucrats have little expertise in the fields they oversee. Because competition for grants, housing perks and career advancement is so intense, officials base their decisions on the number of papers published.
''Even fake papers count because nobody actually reads them,'' said Mr. Fang, who is more widely known by his pen name, Fang Zhouzi, and whose Web site, New Threads, has exposed more than 900 instances of fakery, some involving university presidents and nationally lionized researchers.
When plagiarism is exposed, colleagues and school leaders often close ranks around the accused. Mr. Fang said this was partly because preserving relationships trumped protecting the reputation of the institution. But the other reason, he said, is more sobering: Few academics are clean enough to point a finger at others. One result is that plagiarizers often go unpunished, which only encourages more of it, said Zeng Guoping, director of the Institute of Science Technology and Society at Tsinghua University in Beijing, which helped run the survey of 6,000 academics.
He cited the case of Chen Jin, a computer scientist who was once celebrated for having invented a sophisticated microprocessor but who, it turned out, had taken a chip made by Motorola, scratched out its name, and claimed it as his own. After Mr. Chen was showered with government largess and accolades, the exposure in 2006 was an embarrassment for the scientific establishment that backed him.
But even though Mr. Chen lost his university post, he was never prosecuted. ''When people see the accused still driving their flashy cars, it sends the wrong message,'' Mr. Zeng said.
The problem is not confined to the realm of science. In fact many educators say the culture of cheating takes root in high school, where the competition for slots in the country's best colleges is unrelenting and high marks on standardized tests are the most important criterion for admission. Ghost-written essays and test questions can be bought. So, too, can a ''hired gun'' test taker who will assume the student's identity for the grueling two-day college entrance exam.
Then there are the gadgets -- wristwatches and pens embedded with tiny cameras -- that transmit signals to collaborators on the outside who then relay back the correct answers. Even if such products are illegal, students spent $150 million last year on Internet essays and high-tech subterfuge, a fivefold increase over 2007, according to a Wuhan University study, which identified 800 Web sites offering such illicit services.
Academic deceit is not limited to high school students. In July, Centenary College, a New Jersey institution with satellite branches in China and Taiwan, shuttered its business schools in Shanghai, Beijing and Taipei after finding rampant cheating among students. Although school administrators declined to discuss the nature of the misconduct, it was serious enough to withhold degrees from each of the programs' 400 students. Given a chance to receive their M.B.A.'s by taking another exam, all but two declined, school officials said.
Nonchalant Cheating
Ask any Chinese student about academic skullduggery and the response is startlingly nonchalant. Lu, an engineering student who last spring graduated from Tsinghua University, considered a plum of the country's college system, said it was common for students to swap test answers or plagiarize essays from one another. ''Perhaps it's a cultural difference but there is nothing bad or embarrassing about it,'' said Mr. Lu, who started this semester on a master's degree at Stanford University and asked that his full name not be used for fear his candor might affect his future. ''It's not that students can't do the work. They just see it as a way of saving time.''
The Chinese government has vowed to address the problem. Editorials in the state-run press frequently condemn plagiarism and last month, Liu Yandong, a powerful Politburo member who oversees Chinese publications, vowed to close some of the 5,000 academic journals whose sole existence, many scholars say, is to provide an outlet for doctoral students and professors eager to inflate their publishing credentials.
Fang Shimin and another crusading journalist, Fang Xuanchang, have heard the vows and threats before. In 2004 and again in 2006, the Ministry of Education announced antifraud campaigns but the two bodies they established to tackle the problem have yet to mete out any punishments.
In recent years, both journalists have taken on Xiao Chuanguo, a urologist who invented a surgical procedure aimed at restoring bladder function in children with spina bifida, a congenital deformation of the spinal column that can lead to incontinence, and when untreated, kidney failure and death.
In a series of investigative articles and blog postings, the two men uncovered discrepancies in Dr. Xiao's Web site, including claims that he had published 26 articles in English-language journals (they could only find four) and that he had won an achievement award from the American Urological Association (the award was for an essay he wrote).
But even more troubling, they said, were assertions that his surgery had an 85 percent success rate. Of more than 100 patients interviewed, they said none reported having been cured of incontinence, with nearly 40 percent saying their health had worsened after the procedure, which involved rerouting a leg nerve to the bladder. (In early trials, doctors in the United States who have done the surgery have found the results to be far more promising.)
Wherever the truth may have been, Dr. Xiao was incensed. He filed a string of libel suits against Fang Shimin and told anyone who would listen that revenge would be his.
This summer both men were brutally attacked on the street in Beijing -- Fang Xuanchang by thugs with an iron bar and Fang Shimin by two men wielding pepper spray and a hammer.
When the police arrested Dr. Xiao on Sept. 21, he quickly confessed to hiring the men to carry out the attack, according to the police report. His reason, he said, was vengeance for the revelations he blames for blocking his appointment to the prestigious Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Despite his confession, Dr. Xiao's employer, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, appeared unwilling to take any action against him. In the statement they released, administrators said they were shocked by news of his arrest but said they would await the outcome of judicial procedures before severing their ties to him.
Online Correction: October 7, 2010, Thursday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly named a member of the Politburo. She is Liu Yandong, not Liu Dongdong. An earlier version of this article also gave an incorrect name for a school where Xiao Chuanguo's appointment was blocked. Dr Xiao was blocked from an appointment to the Chinese Academy of Sciences, not the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.

HEADLINE: Costco's Profit Rose 16% in Quarter

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Net income at the Costco Wholesale Corporation, the warehouse club operator, rose nearly 16 percent in the fourth quarter on higher revenue from membership fees and international operations.
Shoppers, who began to flock to Costco when the recession hit, showed strong demand for food and necessities. Sales of small extras, like housewares and sporting goods, continued to grow modestly. 
Costco earned $432 million, or 97 cents a share, in the quarter that ended Aug. 29, up from $374 million, or 85 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. Revenue rose 8 percent, to $24.13 billion.
The earnings beat analysts' expectations of 95 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters. But Costco fell short of revenue expectations of $24.23 billion.
Costco's push into markets outside the United States paid off. While revenue from sales at stores open at least a year -- a crucial measurement of a retailer's health -- climbed 6 percent over all, that same figure jumped 14 percent for international sales. Excluding the impact of gasoline and foreign exchange, the figure rose 4 percent over all and 8 percent internationally.
Revenue at stores open at least a year rose 5 percent for the month of September. Analysts had expected a 4.5 percent increase.
The company does not issue earnings guidance, but Richard A. Galanti, Costco's chief financial officer, said management was ''positive and aggressive'' as it heads into the holiday season.
''We feel good about selling through without risk of big markdowns, and we've had good sell-through on some seasonal stuff,'' Mr. Galanti said.
Costco has been one of the top performers during the recession, so the more modest quarter left investors a little leery. Shares of the company, based in Issaquah, Wash., rose 75 cents, to $65.41, in Nasdaq trading.
For the full year, Costco's net income increased 19 percent, to $1.3 billion, or $2.92 a share, compared with $1.09 billion, or $2.47 a share, a year earlier. Annual revenue rose 9.1 percent, to $77.95 billion.

HEADLINE: No Food Stamps for Sodas

BYLINE: By THOMAS FARLEY and RICHARD F. DAINES. 
Thomas Farley is the New York City health commissioner. Richard F. Daines is the New York State health commissioner.

 BODY:
SINCE its introduction in 1964, America's food stamp program has helped millions of struggling Americans put food on their tables in difficult times. During the recent economic downturn, the number of people in New York City receiving this assistance has grown more than 35 percent.
Recipients, however, aren't allowed to buy everything a grocery store might sell. The federal government bars the use of food stamps to buy cigarettes, beer, wine, liquor or prepared foods like hot deli sandwiches and restaurant entrees. Still, the program, which is supposed to promote nutrition as well as reduce hunger, has a serious flaw: food stamps can be used to buy soda and other sweetened drinks. 
Medical researchers have increasingly associated the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages with weight gain and the development of diabetes. Over the past 30 years, consumption of sugary beverages in the United States has more than doubled, in parallel with the rise in obesity, to the point where nearly one-sixth of an average teenager's calories now come from these drinks.
Some 57 percent of adults in New York City and 40 percent of children in New York City public schools are overweight or obese. The numbers are especially high in low-income neighborhoods, where people are most likely to suffer the devastating health consequences. One in eight adult city residents now has diabetes, and the disease is nearly twice as common among poorer New Yorkers as it is among wealthier ones. Diabetes rates in the low-income neighborhood of East New York, for instance, are four times those in affluent Gramercy Park.
And substantial health care costs arise from this trend: obesity-related illnesses cost New York State residents nearly $8 billion a year in medical costs, or $770 per household. All of us pay the price through higher taxes.
Every year, tens of millions of federal dollars are spent on sweetened beverages in New York City through the food stamp program -- far more than is spent on obesity prevention. This amounts to an enormous subsidy to the sweetened beverage industry.
To correct this, New York City and State are asking the United States Department of Agriculture, which administers the food stamp program, to authorize a demonstration project in New York City. The city would bar the use of food stamps to buy beverages that contain more sugar than substance -- that is, beverages with low nutritional value that contain more than 10 calories per eight-ounce serving. The policy would not apply to milk, milk substitutes (like soy milk, rice milk or powdered milk) or fruit juices without added sugar -- and its effects would be rigorously evaluated.
This policy change would be entirely in keeping with existing standards for defining what is and isn't nutritious. The Agriculture Department itself has already rightly declared sugar-sweetened beverages to be ''foods of minimal nutritional value.''
The city's proposed program would not reduce participants' food stamp benefits or their ability to feed their families a nutritionally adequate diet. They would still receive every penny of support they now get, meaning they would have as much, if not more, to spend on nutritious food. And they could still purchase soda if they chose -- just not with taxpayer dollars.
This proposal to adjust the food stamp program is just one of many steps New York City is taking to reduce obesity. The city also has programs to increase the availability of fresh produce in poor neighborhoods; has set nutrition requirements for meals served in schools, after-school and day care programs and centers for the elderly; and has begun advertising campaigns to educate the public about obesity and nutrition. Taken together, these efforts will bring us closer to stemming the wave of obesity and diabetes in New York.
We are confident that this plan to reduce the consumption of sweetened beverages, if approved by the Department of Agriculture, would strengthen our efforts to combat a serious and worsening health crisis in New York City and could eventually help fight obesity in other communities across the state and nation. At the least it would ensure that food stamps wouldn't subsidize, in the name of nutrition, a product that causes obesity and a lifetime of health problems.

HEADLINE: Coal Plant Would Get New Controls

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

 BODY:
The Environmental Protection Agency signaled on Wednesday that it would require a New Mexico power plant, one of the largest coal-fired ones in the nation, to install $717 million in pollution controls to curb emissions that spread haze over the Four Corners region of the Southwest, home to national parks like Mesa Verde. 
The proposal to install the equipment on the oldest three units of the massive 2,250-megawatt plant is likely to have a long-term effect on both the territory and the economy of the Navajo Nation, which covers an area three times the size of Vermont across Arizona, New Mexico and Utah.
The Four Corners Power Plant and the coal mine on the Navajo reservation that supplies it with fuel employ more than 1,000 people, industry officials who oppose the costly controls say.
No other power plant in the country, the E.P.A. says, emits as high a level of nitrogen oxide as the Four Corners one. Such particles contribute to forming ozone and regional haze.
An earlier version of the proposed rule prompted Arizona Public Service, the state's major utility, to suggest that it might have to close the three units affected by the rule if they could not be run at a profit.
Responding to the E.P.A. announcement, a spokesman for the company did not go that far on Wednesday. ''Once we have an opportunity to thoroughly review and consider the proposal, we will evaluate the various scenarios,'' the spokesman, Jim McDonald, said.
Parks advocates welcomed the proposed requirements. ''The people living in Farmington and Shiprock have some of the worst pollution in the United States -- the ozone levels are as bad as Phoenix and Los Angeles,'' said Roger Clark, who directs the air and energy programs of the nonprofit Grand Canyon Trust. .
''I'm pleased to see that E.P.A. has followed through in what we think is the right interpretation of the Clean Air Act,'' he said
The act requires the air around areas like national parks to be as clean as possible.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 8, 2010

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Thursday about a proposal by the Environmental Protection Agency to require the installation of costly air pollution controls at the Four Corners Power Plant, which is fired by coal, misidentified the state in which it is located. It is on Navajo territory in New Mexico, not in Arizona.

HEADLINE: Private Sector Report Shows Loss of 39,000 Jobs Last Month

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Private employers in the United States unexpectedly cut 39,000 jobs in September after an upwardly revised gain of 10,000 in August, a report by a payrolls processor showed Wednesday. 
The August figure was originally reported as a loss of 10,000.
The median of estimates of 38 economists surveyed by Reuters for the ADP Employer Services report, jointly developed with Macroeconomic Advisers, was for a rise of 24,000 private-sector jobs in September.
The ADP figures come ahead of the government's much more comprehensive labor market report on Friday.
That report is expected to show that overall nonfarm payrolls were unchanged in September, based on a Reuters poll of analysts, but a rise in private payrolls of 75,000.
Economists often refer to the ADP report to fine-tune their expectations for the payrolls numbers, though it is not always accurate in predicting the outcome.

HEADLINE: Europe Presses China to Alter Trade Practices

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
BRUSSELS (Reuters) -- The European Union pressed China on Wednesday to amend its trade practices to stop technology theft, counterfeiting and discrimination against foreign companies, after it failed to make Beijing budge on its exchange rate. 
Opening a day-long meeting with Premier Wen Jiabao of China, the president of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, said the commercial relationship between China and the European Union, worth 327 billion euros ($453 billion) in 2009, was vital for the global economy.
Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, the leader of Europe's biggest exporting country, met Mr. Wen on Tuesday evening and pledged to work for China to be granted the European Union's coveted ''market economy'' trade status by 2016. That would give Beijing better protection against European antidumping penalties -- a major irritant for the Chinese.
But the European trade commissioner, Karel De Gucht, set out a litany of European grievances on which he said China must make progress if it wanted that status before it automatically receives it in 2016 under World Trade Organization rules.
''This question must be considered on the basis of clear commitments, for example, on access to the Chinese market, public procurement, protection of intellectual property and even the exchange rate,'' Mr. De Gucht told the French daily Le Monde.
Euro zone policy makers urged Mr. Wen on Tuesday to allow China's currency to rise more rapidly, but he politely rebuffed them, repeating Beijing's standard line on seeking currency stability.
The monetary dialogue came against a backdrop of growing global ''currency wars'' in which major industrial nations such as Japan and the United States are seeking to weaken their exchange rates while emerging economies such as Brazil and South Korea are taking or threatening measures to curb capital inflows.
Separately on Wednesday, the European Union signed a free trade agreement with South Korea, its first such pact with an Asian partner, after announcing the start of negotiations for a similar accord with Malaysia.
With the Doha round of global trade liberalization talks at an impasse, Brussels is increasingly looking to bilateral and regional trade agreements as a way forward to bolster commerce, especially with fast-growing Asian economies.

HEADLINE: West Virginia Sues U.S. Over Mining Restrictions

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

 BODY:
The state of West Virginia sued two federal agencies on Wednesday, seeking to reverse the stricter controls on mountaintop coal mining adopted in 2009 by the Obama administration.
Governor Joe Manchin III said that the regulations were unlawful, usurped state rights, were based on inadequate science and harmed the state by preventing new mining projects. Announcing the suit against the Environmental Protection Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers, Mr. Manchin, a Democrat, condemned what he called the Obama administration's ''attempts to destroy our coal industry and way of life in West Virginia.'' 
Mr. Manchin is now in a close race for the Senate seat left open by the death of Robert Byrd. His Republican opponent, John Raese, has accused him of wavering in his dedication to the coal industry, a mainstay of the state's economy; Mr. Manchin has fiercely denied the charge.
Wednesday's announcement, made with the head of the coal association at his side, was an opportunity for Mr. Manchin to highlight his support for coal and to distance himself from President Obama, who is unpopular with many voters.
The Environmental Protection Agency said on Wednesday that it would defend the regulations in court. In a statement, the agency said, ''State officials have not engaged in a meaningful discussion of sustainable mining practices that will create jobs while protecting the waters that Appalachian communities depend on for drinking, swimming and fishing.'' It said that the ecological concerns behind the regulations had been affirmed by an independent advisory panel.
Mountaintop removal, in which hundreds of feet of earth and stone are blasted off the tops of hills to gain access to the coal seams beneath, has become a major mining method in West Virginia, Kentucky and nearby states. Producers say that it saves money, but critics say it destroys the landscape, as the removed dirt and rocks fill in valleys and toxic chemicals are released.
Federal permits for such mining operations could be obtained relatively easily in the past, but in 2009, the agency, citing evidence of ecological harm as well as a growing public outcry, started requiring more stringent environmental reviews of new mining proposals, and started taking stronger action to protect mountain streams under the Clean Water Act.
Mr. Manchin, in announcing the suit, said that of the 23 mining-permit applications that were pending in 2009, only two have so far been approved. The suit was scheduled to be filed late Wednesday in the U.S. District Court in Charleston, W.Va.
The agency has also said it may revoke or drastically alter a previous permit for a large proposed mine in West Virginia known as Spruce 1. A final decision on that project will not be announced until late this year.

HEADLINE: Months After Cutbacks, M.T.A. Approves Higher Fares

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority approved a package of fare increases on Thursday for its subways, buses and commuter railroads, the third time in three years that New Yorkers will face a sharp rise in the cost of getting around.
On Dec. 30, when the increases take effect, the price of a 30-day MetroCard will rise by $15 to $104 a month, a 17 percent increase, and a single-ride ticket will go up 25 cents to $2.50.
The 7-day and 30-day MetroCards for the city's subway and bus system will remain uncapped, as transit officials acknowledged the public had little taste for an earlier proposal to restrict the number of rides that could be taken on such passes. Still, the pricing structure places the biggest burden on the subway system's most frequent riders, the one-third of commuters who buy 30-day passes. 
The fare increases come months after the authority, reeling from an enormous budget gap, enacted severe service cuts that discontinued bus and subway lines throughout the city. But board members said it would be irresponsible not to raise fares, and they pointed the blame squarely at the State Legislature, which this year redirected subsidies meant for the transit agency.
''Being on this board really made me stop believing in fairy tales,'' said Doreen M. Frasca, an appointee of Gov. David A. Paterson. ''I don't think for a minute Albany is going to do anything for us; in fact, I think they're going to take more.'' She added: ''I hate taking this vote. But at this point in time, it's our only option.''
Unlike the raucous hearings that accompanied this summer's service cuts, the board's hourlong debate on Thursday was marked by few outbursts or protests. The prevailing mood was one of resignation, not outrage. ''We are not in a position to be able to avoid this increase,'' Jay H. Walder, the authority's chairman, said in a solemn tone as the meeting began.
The new fare structure, approved by a 12-2 vote, will raise the price of tickets on Metro-North Railroad and the Long Island Rail Road by 7 percent to 14 percent, depending on distance. The unlimited weekly MetroCard will cost $29, up from $27, and riders who buy a new MetroCard rather than adding money to one they already have will pay a $1 surcharge.
Since its introduction in 1998, the monthly MetroCard's price has risen 65 percent, far outpacing inflation. The 30-day pass originally cost $63 a month. Subway and bus riders will have to take 50 trips a month to justify the new $104 cost, officials said, up from 46 trips now.
Overall, the fare increases will generate 7.5 percent more revenue for the troubled authority, the percentage it agreed to in a deal with the State Legislature last year.
But riders' advocates expressed dismay on Thursday that the authority was still raising fares after cutting service. ''This fare plan hits our best customers with the heftiest fare hike,'' said Andrew Albert, chairman of the New York City Transit Riders Council. Officials defended the big increase for monthly cards, arguing that users of the 30-day pass tend to be more affluent than other riders.
A proposed toll increase on the authority's tunnels and bridges will be considered by the board on Oct. 27. One proposal would raise cash tolls by 30 percent or more, while E-ZPass users would not pay any increase.
The authority has a balanced budget for 2010, but there was concern that the agency could face another crisis soon. ''The business plan of the M.T.A. today is a ticking time bomb,'' said Andrew M. Saul, the board's vice chairman. He said the fare increases approved on Thursday are ''just the beginning.''

HEADLINE: The End Of The Tunnel

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
The Erie Canal. Hoover Dam. The Interstate Highway System. Visionary public projects are part of the American tradition, and have been a major driver of our economic development.
And right now, by any rational calculation, would be an especially good time to improve the nation's infrastructure. We have the need: our roads, our rail lines, our water and sewer systems are antiquated and increasingly inadequate. We have the resources: a million-and-a-half construction workers are sitting idle, and putting them to work would help the economy as a whole recover from its slump. And the price is right: with interest rates on federal debt at near-record lows, there has never been a better time to borrow for long-term investment.
But American politics these days is anything but rational. Republicans bitterly opposed even the modest infrastructure spending contained in the Obama stimulus plan. And, on Thursday, Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey, canceled America's most important current public works project, the long-planned and much-needed second rail tunnel under the Hudson River. 
It was a destructive and incredibly foolish decision on multiple levels. But it shouldn't have been all that surprising. We are no longer the nation that used to amaze the world with its visionary projects. We have become, instead, a nation whose politicians seem to compete over who can show the least vision, the least concern about the future and the greatest willingness to pander to short-term, narrow-minded selfishness.
So, about that tunnel: with almost 1,200 people per square mile, New Jersey is the most densely populated state in America, more densely populated than any major European nation. Add in the fact that many residents work in New York, and you have a state that can't function without adequate public transportation. There just isn't enough space for everyone to drive to work.
But right now there's just one century-old rail tunnel linking New Jersey and New York -- and it's running close to capacity. The need for another tunnel couldn't be more obvious.
So last year the project began. Of the $8.7 billion in planned funding, less than a third was to come from the State of New Jersey; the rest would come, in roughly equal amounts, from the independent Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and from the federal government. Even if costs were to rise substantially, as they often do on big projects, it was a very good deal for the state.
But Mr. Christie killed it anyway.
News reports suggest that his immediate goal was to shift funds to local road projects and existing rail repairs. There were, however, much better ways to raise those funds, such as an increase in the state's relatively low gasoline taxes -- and bear in mind that whatever motorists gain from low gas taxes will be at least partly undone by pain from the canceled project in the form of growing congestion and traffic delays. But, no, in modern America, no tax increase can ever be justified, for any reason.
So this was a terrible, shortsighted move from New Jersey's point of view. But that's not the whole cost. Canceling the tunnel was also a blow to national hopes of recovery, part of a pattern of penny-pinching that has played a large role in our continuing economic stagnation.
When people ask why the Obama stimulus didn't accomplish more, one good response is to ask, what stimulus? Leaving aside the cost of financial rescues and safety-net programs like unemployment insurance, federal spending has risen only modestly -- and this rise has been largely offset by cutbacks at the state and local level. Many of these cuts were forced by Congress, which has refused to approve adequate aid to the states. But as Mr. Christie is demonstrating, local politicians are also doing their part.
And the ideology that has led Mr. Christie to undermine his state's future is, of course, the same ideology that has led almost all Republicans and some Democrats to stand in the way of any meaningful action to revive the nation's economy. Worse yet, next month's election seems likely to reward Republicans for their obstructionism.
So here's how you should think about the decision to kill the tunnel: It's a terrible thing in itself, but, beyond that, it's a perfect symbol of how America has lost its way. By refusing to pay for essential investment, politicians are both perpetuating unemployment and sacrificing long-run growth. And why not? After all, this seems to be a winning electoral strategy. All vision of a better future seems to have been lost, replaced with a refusal to look beyond the narrowest, most shortsighted notion of self-interest.
I wish I could say something optimistic at this point. But at least for now, I don't see any light at the end of this tunnel.

HEADLINE: Halt in Foreclosures a New Blow to Home Sales

BYLINE: By ANDREW MARTIN and DAVID STREITFELD; Andrew Martin reported from Florida and David Streitfeld from California.

 BODY:
OCALA, Fla. -- Amanda Ducksworth was supposed to move in to her new home this week, a three-bedroom steal here in central Florida with a horse farm across the road. Instead, she is camped out with her 7-year-old son at her boss's house.
Like many buyers across the country, Ms. Ducksworth was about to complete the purchase of a foreclosed house when it suddenly went off the market. Fannie Mae, the giant mortgage holding company that buys loans from commercial lenders, is pulling back sales of homes that might have been foreclosed in bad faith.
''I gave up my rental thinking I would have a house,'' said Ms. Ducksworth, a 28-year-old catering assistant. ''Now I'm sharing a room with my son. What the hell is up with that?'' 
With home sales this past summer at the lowest level in more than a decade, real estate is ill-prepared to suffer another blow. But as a scandal unfolds over mortgage lenders' shoddy preparation of foreclosure documents, the fallout is beginning to hammer the housing market, especially in states like Florida where distressed properties are abundant.
''This crisis takes a situation that's already bad and kind of cements it into place,'' said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist for MFR Inc., an economic consulting firm.
Three major mortgage lenders -- Bank of America, GMAC Mortgage and JPMorgan Chase -- have said they are suspending foreclosures in the 23 states where they first need a judge's approval. They are also waving off Fannie Mae from selling any of the foreclosed homes whose loans they sold to Fannie.
The companies say they are reviewing their operations after disclosures that employees signed documents without determining the accuracy of the material, as is required by law.
Those reviews are throwing into limbo hundreds of thousands of foreclosures and pending home sales, analysts estimate, though the lenders and Fannie Mae have been mostly silent about precise numbers and other specifics.
More broadly, the revelations about the sloppy paperwork are emboldening homeowners and law enforcement officials in many states to question whether lenders rightfully hold the notes underlying foreclosed properties -- further chilling the housing market.
Distressed properties, many of which are in foreclosure, make up about a third of all home sales. ''Foreclosures are going to slow to a crawl,'' said Guy D. Cecala, publisher of the trade magazine Inside Mortgage Finance.
Of the 23 states where foreclosures need court approval, Florida has by far the most trouble -- about a half-million cases clog its courts -- and the moratoriums are having a noticeable effect.
Because most lenders sold their mortgages to Fannie Mae, it is largely that company that has been sending e-mails to real estate agents about putting off deals and removing houses from the market. In most cases, the agents are being told the freeze will last 30 to 90 days, but agents say there is no way to know for sure.
A snapshot of the problems can be seen at the real estate agency that sold Ms. Ducksworth her home, Marc Joseph Realty, based in Fort Myers.
The agency had 35 deals that were supposed to close this month. As of Thursday, Fannie had postponed 11 of them. Another handful of homes that did not have offers or were being prepared for market had also been withdrawn.
''If this wipes out half my inventory, that's a scary thing,'' said Bill Mitchell, the agency's closing coordinator.
As he spoke, his computer pinged and another message from Fannie came through about withdrawing a house. It had the subject line, ''Unable to Market Notice.''
Another client of the agency, Richard Clark, is caught in the foreclosure vise on both ends.
A delivery truck driver, Mr. Clark has gone through several rough years: his wife lost her banking job and they eventually separated; a vending business did not succeed; he fell behind on his home payments; and CitiMortgage rebuffed his efforts to restructure the mortgage.
With the prospect of being tossed out of his house in a foreclosure of his own, Mr. Clark, 62, cobbled together $58,000 -- most of it from his parents -- and successfully bid on a house in North Fort Myers that was in foreclosure. His offer on the house, with three bedrooms and two baths, a Jacuzzi tub in the master bedroom and a Key lime tree in the backyard, was finally approved on Oct. 1.
''It's been a rocky two years,'' Mr. Clark, a stocky man with a short pony tail, wire-rim glasses and a gold hoop earring, said while touring the rambling one-story home. ''It's a dream house for me.''
At least, it was. On Tuesday, Fannie suspended the deal. Mr. Clark said he did not know what to do. ''I'm kind of hoping I have a place to live,'' he said. ''Now, who knows?''
It is possible the foreclosure on his current house in nearby Cape Coral -- he has a court hearing on Dec. 7 -- will also become caught up in the current problems, but Mr. Clark said he was not pleased by the prospect of staying there any longer.
''I'd rather just get on with it, get on with my life,'' he said.
In the states far from Florida where foreclosures are an equally large problem but there is no judicial review -- Nevada, Arizona and California -- there were early signs this week that the document crisis was spreading. The only time a foreclosure in those states enters a courtroom is when the borrower sues the lender, something few of those in default have the money or the will to do.
In a telephone interview on Wednesday, Gary Kent, a foreclosure specialist in San Diego who has 80 listings, said he had not heard from Fannie or any lender about withdrawing a property. All his deals were on track, Mr. Kent said.
But a few hours later, Mr. Kent said he had received an e-mail about removing a home that was under contract.
The message was from his title insurer, who said that Pittsburgh-based PNC Bank was imposing a 30-day moratorium on all foreclosure sales. (PNC declined to comment to a reporter.)
Mr. Kent's confidence was shaken. ''My buyer's upset, my agent's upset and I'm a little nervous,'' he said.
Several factors are likely to delay many more foreclosed houses from reaching the market and finding new owners.
Law enforcement officials in several states, including Texas, Maryland and Connecticut, are demanding a suspension of foreclosures until lenders can prove they are using legal methods.
It is unclear how many lenders will go along.
In a move that sets up a potential showdown in Texas, one major lender, CitiMortgage, is arguing that it is being considered guilty until proven innocent by the state attorney general.
''We have no reason to believe our employees are not following our process, and therefore have no reason to stop foreclosures,'' a Citi spokesman said.
Another factor is the reaction of the title insurers, who defend homeowners in disputes over a home's ownership. Lenders require title insurance before approving a mortgage.
The crisis took many title insurers by surprise, said Kurt Pfotenhauer, the chief executive of the industry's trade group, the American Land Title Association.
One possibility the title insurers are discussing is obtaining warranties from lenders against errors in their foreclosures. Every title insurer, Mr. Pfotenhauer said, ''understands there is a brand new risk that has to be evaluated. It's not at all clear that courts across the country are going to be reversing their earlier decisions on foreclosures. But we don't know.''
In the meantime, buyers like Ms. Ducksworth here in Ocala are at a loss for answers.
''She's in a mess, actually,'' said Jim Haston, Ms. Ducksworth's agent.
''I really don't know what to tell her,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Sharp Jabs As Rivals For Senate Debate Again

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
NORWALK, Conn. -- The Republican candidate, Linda E. McMahon, and her Democratic opponent, Richard Blumenthal, traded harsh attacks on Thursday in a debate that underscored the increasingly combative tone of the Senate race in Connecticut.
Again and again, Mr. Blumenthal accused Ms. McMahon, the former chief executive of World Wrestling Entertainment, of running a business that promoted sex and violence and that was the subject of Congressional and criminal inquiries centering on steroid use in wrestling.
''We are different,'' said Mr. Blumenthal, casting himself as a defender of the public during his roughly two decades as the state's attorney general. 
But Ms. McMahon responded aggressively, at one point accusing him of falsely claiming that her company had faced a criminal audit over its employment practices.
''Maybe you just misspoke again, like the time when you talked about how you had served in Vietnam,'' Ms. McMahon said dryly, referring to Mr. Blumenthal's explanation this year that he had ''misspoken'' when he said on several occasions that he had served in the Vietnam War, though he did not.
Mr. Blumenthal, who was in the Marine Reserves during the war and never left the country, gave her an icy stare before turning back to the audience at the packed banquet ball and telling them that he had inadvertently ''mischaracterized'' his military service on only a few instances.
''I regret it,'' he said. ''It was unintentional.''
The debate, the second between the two candidates, was sponsored by the Greater Norwalk Chamber of Commerce and streamed live on the Internet. It was to be televised later on Thursday.
The frostiness between Mr. Blumenthal and Ms. McMahon was evident almost from the start, as they jabbed each other in highly personal terms. The attorney general appeared in his standard dark blue suit and red tie; Ms. McMahon wore a cream-colored jacket over a fuchsia dress.
Ms. McMahon, who was received warmly by the business-minded crowd, drew a contrast between her record of running a business that employed people and Mr. Blumenthal's career in public office.
''You don't understand business,'' she said. ''That's not your fault. You've been in government all your life.''
Ms. McMahon warned that sending Mr. Blumenthal to the Senate would be a mistake, saying that he had supported a large tax increase as a state legislator in the late 1980s. ''I don't think we can send Dick Blumenthal to Washington with his tax-and-spend philosophy,'' she said.
Mr. Blumenthal, in turn, seized on published reports that Ms. McMahon had helped organize her company's response to a steroid scandal during the 1980s and even alerted a doctor who distributed steroids about a potential federal investigation.
''She tipped off a doctor about a federal investigation,'' he said.
Ms. McMahon did not respond to the attack, quickly changing the subject back to jobs, which her advisers believe is the only issue voters want to hear about.
''I think you want to focus on W.W.E. because you can't focus on the economy and creating jobs,'' she told Mr. Blumenthal.
The candidates sparred over other issues, including tax cuts, energy policy and health care. On taxes, Ms. McMahon said she supported continuing Bush-era tax cuts for people at all income levels, while Mr. Blumenthal said he wanted to extend them only for the middle class.
Ms. McMahon criticized Mr. Blumenthal for supporting an energy bill that would set government limits on emissions of pollutants, calling it an ''energy tax'' that would hurt consumers. Mr. Blumenthal vigorously disputed that, saying she was citing ''phony numbers by a right-wing group.''
The Connecticut race is drawing national attention as the two parties battle for control of the Senate, where Democrats now have a majority.

HEADLINE: While Europe Scrimps, European Union Spends

BYLINE: By STEPHEN CASTLE

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- In Greece, taxes are up and so is the age of retirement. In Spain, civil servants have taken pay cuts. In Britain, spending on welfare, the military and education could be chopped by a quarter.
Despite mounting public protests across the Continent, an austerity drive unparalleled in modern, united Europe is building.
In Brussels, meanwhile, the bureaucracy that runs the European Union is haggling over how much to increase next year's budget. 
In 2011, the European Union will pour billions more euros into the Continent's regions for infrastructure and other projects. Spending on justice and security is set to rise sharply, while even purely administrative costs are expected to increase by more than 4 percent.
Supporters see the spending as an antidote to austerity, a way to keep a fragile economic recovery alive.
Critics say it highlights the remoteness of Brussels, where pay raises are written into law, spending priorities are decided up to seven years in advance and millions are spent on questionable efforts to spread the message of a 27-nation bloc that often seems to have little decisive to say on issues that matter to voters, like immigration.
National governments pay most of the bill, and some have lost patience. Vince Cable, the British business secretary, predicts a ''backlash'' against the bloc.
''When national governments, including mine, are having to make very painful cuts in public spending,'' he told the European Parliament, ''no one can understand why the European budget is not being subjected to the same discipline.''
The European Commission, the E.U. executive, is seeking a 5.9 percent increase in the bloc's 2011 budget, lifting annual spending above 130 billion, or nearly $180 billion -- about half the annual public spending of a midsize nation like the Netherlands. National governments have tried to limit spending to 126.5 billion, a 2.9 percent increase.
But the European Parliament, which must approve the budget, sought to add or restore a host of measures in a mix of altruism, special interests and pork barrel politics familiar to anyone who tracks the U.S. Congress.
Earmarks sought include 300 million for dairy farmers, 9 million for the World Special Olympics Summer Games in Greece, 10 million for a school fruit plan and 8 million for beekeeping. All told, the total would be about 3.5 billion more than the governments say they can afford.
''You cannot do things in an ivory tower,'' said James Elles, a British Conservative member of the European Parliament who has been on its budget committee since 1984. ''People back home do observe what's going on. They have to feel we are taking responsible decisions for 2011.''
Critics point to what they say are areas of fat -- 8 million for promoting awareness of the bloc's agricultural policy, for example. They also highlight the cost of E.U. administration, which the European Commission would like to increase by 4.5 percent, to 8.4 billion, in 2011.
While some European countries are cutting the salaries of civil servants, the national governments are struggling to curb the pay of E.U. officials, who often earn significantly more than their counterparts in national capitals, while also paying income taxes at lower rates and receiving generous benefits.
When the governments held pay increases for E.U. officials to 1.85 percent this year -- half the amount due under the system -- they were promptly taken to court by the European Commission. (Most observers expect the commission to win).
Indeed, overall costs of administering the European Union are rising, exacerbated by new bodies created by the Lisbon Treaty late last year.
There is the new president of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy of Belgium, and a new foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton of Britain. There is also the European Parliament, which got an additional 9.4 million to exercise new powers.
To run his operation, Mr. Van Rompuy got 25 million for 2010. Ms. Ashton's new foreign service will cost 476 million in 2011, the commission says, much of it met by transferring existing staff, but with 34.5 million needed for new posts.
The other question is where to house the service, and whether to lease a new building at an estimated annual cost of 10 to 15 million.
That is a tough sell when the European Union does not lack new buildings, so Ms. Ashton is now targeting one occupied by legal translators.
Salvador Garrigo Polledo, a Spanish center-right member of the European Parliament's budget committee, concedes a perception problem.
''It's a very small bureaucracy,'' he said, ''but it is very visible for the European taxpayer.''
As it has for decades, the bulk of the budget -- about 110 billion this year -- will go to regional or agricultural subsidies, seen by some as a counterweight to austerity.
''The E.U. budget is about investment in the very things we need to take care of in these difficult economic times,'' said Goran Farm, a budget spokesman for the main center-left group in the European Parliament. ''We must fight the austerity message from ministers -- especially the hard-line ideas of governments in the U.K., the Czech Republic and some Scandinavian countries.''
Many economists, though, consider agriculture subsidies an added cost to European consumers and a burden on farmers in poor countries who cannot compete on their own.
Much regional spending is mandated; infrastructure projects where contracts are already signed cannot be canceled, said Patrizio Fiorilli, a budget spokesman for the European Commission.
Jorge Nunez Ferrer, an associate research fellow at the Center for European Policy Studies, believes that the economic backdrop will concentrate minds when the bloc begins to review longer-term priorities later this year.
''Austerity will have an impact on the budget,'' he said. ''I think there is an understanding that you cannot just defend funding things for historical reasons or because it is politically convenient.''
Next year, for instance, E.U. officials may have their pay cut by 0.4 percent.
But that modest sacrifice is unlikely to placate the protesting public.
Serge Colpin, 58, from Charleroi in the depressed south of Belgium, joined demonstrations last week in Brussels. An unemployed former soldier who said he had been seeking work for eight years, Mr. Colpin is angry at bankers, politicians -- and people who work for the European Union.
''They earn too much, they are exempt from a lot of tax, they have cars, they have drivers,'' he said. ''And we pay.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Science Fiction for the Great Recession

BYLINE: By MIKE HALE

 BODY:
''Jim'' is two or maybe three movies in one. There's an angry downsizing drama, a sort of ''Falling Down'' for the derivatives age, that overlaps with a cautionary tale about modern medicine and genetic engineering, and these connect in a hazy way to a dystopian science-fiction fantasy set on a future earth populated by clones. What they all share is a reliance on cliche and a limited visual imagination that is aggravated, in the science-fiction segments, by the film's minuscule budget. 
To be fair, Jeremy Morris-Burke, a theater designer, began writing ''Jim'' as a play before deciding to teach himself how to make a movie, and this indie project -- produced with his wife, Vanessa -- represents his feature debut as writer, director, photographer and editor. He deserves praise for getting it made at all, and he does a good job of keeping the story straight as he moves back and forth among three distinct timelines. Unfortunately, each narrative strand is so packed with straight-out-of-writing-class dialogue that the film feels longer than its hour-and-46-minute running time.
Ms. Morris-Burke, a New York stage actress who, in addition to her producing duties, plays the wife (or former wife, depending on how you look at it) of the unemployed and debt-ridden protagonist, stands out in the small cast.
JIM
Opens on Friday in Manhattan.
Written, directed and edited by Jeremy Morris-Burke; director of photography, Mr. Morris-Burke; music by Alexandre Tannous; production design by Suzanne Wang and Michael Byrnes; costumes by Rabiah Troncelliti; produced by Vanessa Morris-Burke and Mr. Morris-Burke; released by Area 23a. At the Quad Cinema, 34 West 13th Street, Greenwich Village. Running time: 1 hour 46 minutes. This film is not rated.

HEADLINE: Back-to-School Buying Gives Retailers a Lift

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
Back-to-school sales that were stronger than expected have retailers cautiously hoping consumers are back and gearing up for a robust holiday shopping season.
As they emerged from a slow summer, many of the nation's retailers on Thursday reported unexpectedly good sales in September at stores open at least a year -- a crucial indicator known as same-store sales.
In a survey compiled by Thomson Reuters, same-store sales rose 2.8 percent for the 28 retailers surveyed, with 20 reporting same-store sales data for September that met or beat expectations. Some of those results were achieved even though stores cut back on promotions and sales. 
''I don't think we will be back to 2005 levels, but I think it is going to be a decent season, with consumers retrenching to save for the upcoming holiday season,'' Ken Perkins, president of the research firm Retail Metrics, said.
September's same-store sales, referring to sales in the five-week period ended Oct. 2, were helped by several seasonal and market factors, analysts said.
A rise in the stock market helped bolster the consumer outlook last month. And although there might be some retreat in October and November, spending is expected to revive before the end of the year.
Analysts also said that in the last month, consumers were buying on need rather than anticipation, which might account for some of the late back-to-school sales.
''What we have been seeing, particularly because of the downturn, is consumers are holding on to their money and buying closer to when they are actually going to need the product, so fall purchases appear to have been delayed,'' John Long, a retail strategist at Kurt Salmon Associates, said.
In addition, many merchants relied on discounting, particularly in the latter half of the month, Mr. Perkins said.
But there are bright spots in the consumer spending horizon.
Seven major apparel stores catering to teenagers reported a combined 6.7 percent rise in September, soundly beating analysts' expectations of a 0.5 percent increase. Last year's September same-store sales for such retailers declined 2.4 percent.
They all exceeded expectations. Zumiez was up 17 percentin September, compared with a decline of less than 1 percent in the same month in 2009. Same-store sales at Abercrombie & Fitchrose 13 percent, compared with a decline of 18 percent in the month a year ago. American Eagle was up 4 percent, compared with flat sales in September of last year. Buckle and Aeropostale were each up 3 percent.
Discount stores and department stores also posted some of the better results. Discounters' sales increased 3 percent, although that was slightly less than expectations for the month. Sales for department stores were up 4.7 percent, which was 1.6 percent above analysts forecasts.
''The ones that have been doing fairly well consistently have been discounters,'' Mr. Long said. ''Because of the economy, customers are looking closer at value. But we are seeing every category, including luxury, creating value for their customers, making sure they understand what customers are looking for.''
At Saks, where same-store sales rose 6.5 percent, reversing a decline of more than 11 percent in September 2009, the company has detected an interest in shoes, handbags, men's merchandise and women's designer apparel.
And this was even after the company reduced the number and duration of sales and promotions, with no specific plans to increase them for the holidays, said Julia Bentley, a spokeswoman for Saks Inc.
Macy's, which reported sales up 4.8 percent, beating the 3.3 percent climb that analysts had forecast, attributed the rise in its same-store sales to purchases in preparation for school.
''The back-to-school season has been one of our most successful in years,'' the chief executive, Terry J. Lundgren, said in a statement.
The largest department store rise came from Nordstrom, which climbed 7.5 percent, in contrast to a decline of 2.4 percent in September 2009. Strong categories were jewelry, women's shoes and men's clothing, a recorded statement said.
In apparel, Gap sales declined 2 percent, compared with a 1 percent decline in the same month last year. Its Old Navy stores sales fell 5 percent in September 2010, in contrast with a 13 percent rise in September 2009.
The TJX Companies, which owns TJMaxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods, rose 1 percent, in line with expectations. Limited Brands, which owns Limited and Victoria's Secret, reported sales that rose 12 percent, almost triple the expected 4.1 percent increase. In a recorded message, the brand said that it introduced new collections and maintained full-price selling, while not repeating a fall sale that it had held at Victoria's Secret in 2009.
The discount retailer Costco said sales rose 5 percent compared with 1 percent in September last year, while Targetwas up 1.3 percent, reversing a 1.7 percent decline for September a year ago. Target, however, failed to meet expectations.
The figures do not include Wal-Mart Stores, the nation's largest discounter, which does not report monthly sales.

HEADLINE: Picture Books, Long a Staple, Lose Out in the Rush to Read

BYLINE: By JULIE BOSMAN

 BODY:
Picture books are so unpopular these days at the Children's Book Shop in Brookline, Mass., that employees there are used to placing new copies on the shelves, watching them languish and then returning them to the publisher.
''So many of them just die a sad little death, and we never see them again,'' said Terri Schmitz, the owner.
The shop has plenty of company. The picture book, a mainstay of children's literature with its lavish illustrations, cheerful colors and large print wrapped in a glossy jacket, has been fading. It is not going away -- perennials like the Sendaks and Seusses still sell well -- but publishers have scaled back the number of titles they have released in the last several years, and booksellers across the country say sales have been suffering.
The economic downturn is certainly a major factor, but many in the industry see an additional reason for the slump. Parents have begun pressing their kindergartners and first graders to leave the picture book behind and move on to more text-heavy chapter books. Publishers cite pressures from parents who are mindful of increasingly rigorous standardized testing in schools. 
''Parents are saying, 'My kid doesn't need books with pictures anymore,' '' said Justin Chanda, the publisher of Simon & Schuster Books for Young Readers. ''There's a real push with parents and schools to have kids start reading big-kid books earlier. We've accelerated the graduation rate out of picture books.''
Booksellers see this shift too.
''They're 4 years old, and their parents are getting them 'Stuart Little,' '' said Dara La Porte, the manager of the children's department at the Politics and Prose bookstore in Washington. ''I see children pick up picture books, and then the parents say, 'You can do better than this, you can do more than this.' It's a terrible pressure parents are feeling -- that somehow, I shouldn't let my child have this picture book because she won't get into Harvard.''
Literacy experts are quick to say that picture books are not for dummies. Publishers praise the picture book for the particular way it can develop a child's critical thinking skills.
''To some degree, picture books force an analog way of thinking,'' said Karen Lotz, the publisher of Candlewick Press in Somerville, Mass. ''From picture to picture, as the reader interacts with the book, their imagination is filling in the missing themes.''
Many parents overlook the fact that chapter books, even though they have more text, full paragraphs and fewer pictures, are not necessarily more complex.
''Some of the vocabulary in a picture book is much more challenging than in a chapter book,'' said Kris Vreeland, a book buyer for Vroman's Bookstore in Pasadena, Calif., where sales of picture books have been down. ''The words themselves, and the concepts, can be very sophisticated in a picture book.''
They can, for example, be written with Swiftian satire, like ''Monsters Eat Whiny Children'' by Bruce Eric Kaplan, a new book about children who are nearly devoured as a result of bad behavior.
Each year, the coveted Randolph Caldecott Medal goes to the most distinguished picture book published in the United States. (This year it went to ''The Lion and the Mouse'' by Jerry Pinkney, an adaptation of the Aesop's fable with luminous images and no words at all.)
Still, many publishers have gradually reduced the number of picture books they produce for a market that had seen a glut of them, and in an age when very young children, like everyone else, have more options, a lot of them digital, to fill their entertainment hours.
At Scholastic, 5 percent to 10 percent fewer hardcover picture books have been published over the last three years. Don Weisberg, the president of the Penguin Young Readers Group, said that two and a half years ago, the company began publishing fewer titles but that it had devoted more attention to marketing and promoting the ones that remain. Of all the children's books published by Simon & Schuster, about 20 percent are picture books, down from 35 percent a few years ago.
Classic books like ''Goodnight Moon'' and the ''Eloise'' series still sell steadily, alongside more modern popular titles like the ''Fancy Nancy'' books and ''The Three Little Dassies'' by Jan Brett, but even some best-selling authors are feeling the pinch. Jon Scieszka, who wrote ''Robot Zot,'' said his royalty checks had been shrinking, especially in the last year.
''We see the stores displaying less picture books, and publishers are getting a little more cautious about signing up new projects,'' Mr. Scieszka said. ''You can feel that everyone's worried.''
Borders, noticing the sluggish sales, has tried to encourage publishers to lower the list prices, which can be as high as $18. Mary Amicucci, the vice president of children's books for Barnes & Noble, said sales began a slow, steady decline about a year ago. Since then, the stores have rearranged display space so that some picture books are enticingly paired with toys and games.
Other retailers have cut shelf space devoted to picture books while expanding their booming young-adult sections, full of dystopic fiction, graphic novels and ''Twilight''-inspired paranormal romances.
''Young adult fiction has been universally the growing genre,'' said Ms. Lotz of Candlewick, ''and so as retailers adapt to what customers are buying, they are giving more space to that and less space to picture books.''
Some parents say they just want to advance their children's skills. Amanda Gignac, a stay-at-home mother in San Antonio who writes The Zen Leaf, a book blog, said her youngest son, Laurence, started reading chapter books when he was 4.
Now Laurence is 6 1/2, and while he regularly tackles 80-page chapter books, he is still a ''reluctant reader,'' Ms. Gignac said.
Sometimes, she said, he tries to go back to picture books.
''He would still read picture books now if we let him, because he doesn't want to work to read,'' she said, adding that she and her husband have kept him reading chapter books.
Still, many children are getting the message. At Winnona Park Elementary School in Decatur, Ga., a recent book fair was dominated by chapter books, said Ilene Zeff, who organized the fair.
''I've been getting fewer and fewer picture books because they just don't sell,'' Ms. Zeff said. ''By first grade, when the kids go to pick out their books, they ask where the chapter books are. They're just drawn to them.''
On a recent discussion board on Urbanbaby.com, a Web site for parents, one commenter asked for recommendations for chapter books to read to a 5-year-old, and was answered with suggestions like the 272-page ''Phantom Tollbooth'' by Norton Juster and ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz'' by L. Frank Baum -- books generally considered more appropriate for children 9 to 11.
Jen Haller, the vice president and associate publisher of the Penguin Young Readers Group, said that while some children were progressing to chapter books earlier, they were still reading picture books occasionally. ''Picture books have a real comfort element to them,'' Ms. Haller said. ''It's not like this door closes and they never go back to picture books again.''

HEADLINE: Thai Leader Defends Crackdown as Way to Ensure Stability

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva of Thailand acknowledged that a continuing crackdown against the opposition might have led to possible human rights abuses in his country, but he insisted that the emergency policies were necessary to ensure stability. 
''Just as in many other democracies, we cannot allow newspapers, Web sites or radio stations that incite violence,'' Mr. Abhisit said in an interview this week while at an Asia-Europe summit meeting here.
''Having said that, obviously when you have a special law in place, there may be cases where people on the ground might not have followed either the policy or the law,'' he said.
At a time when Thailand holds the presidency of the United Nations Human Rights Council, Mr. Abhisit's government has been criticized by opponents in Thailand over the suppression of so-called red shirt demonstrators and the closing of some opposition news organizations.
Mr. Abhisit said in an interview this week that he took any complaints seriously and that he had taken additional measures in recent weeks to allow human rights monitors to interview people who had been jailed and to ''make sure that there were no mistakes, or abuses.''
Mr. Abhisit took office in late 2008, two years after the coup that removed Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, the billionaire who is now a fugitive overseas. Mr. Abhisit soon faced protests by the red-shirt demonstrators calling for Mr. Thaksin's return.
The deepening divisions in Thai society reached a peak earlier this year with a nine-and-a-half-week antigovernment demonstration in the center of Bangkok. More than 90 people were killed and about 1,400 wounded in clashes between security forces and protesters. Since then, Mr. Abhisit has pursued a two-track policy, promoting national reconciliation while arresting his opponents or silencing them with the censorship of radio stations and the Internet.
In the interview, Mr. Abhisit sought to reinforce his credibility as a supporter of human rights and free speech by suggesting that the policies of the Thai government were little different from what other democracies, including the United States, would do in similar circumstances.
''There's always that difficulty in terms of the balance that you have to make sure that you maintain the law, you keep law and order, and making sure that you're not restricting people's rights,'' he said. ''It's not always easy.''
A state of emergency that forbids large public gatherings remains in effect in Bangkok and surrounding areas.
Mr. Abhisit said he had encountered little criticism from leaders of the European Union at the summit meeting in Brussels.
''They seemed to understand what we are trying to do,'' he said. ''I think everybody now accepts that violence is not the answer, not allowing the rule of law to proceed is not the answer.''
Mr. Abhisit said that his main message for leaders in Brussels was that focusing too closely on redrawing the world's financial architecture could end up distracting from efforts to restart the engines of global growth through trade and what he called the real economy.
Mr. Abhisit said he had pressed the European Commission during his stay in Brussels on access to markets -- in particular for Thai poultry. He said that issue still needed to be resolved.

HEADLINE: PepsiCo Posts 12% Increase In Earnings

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
PepsiCo said on Thursday that its quarterly profit rose 12 percent on strong sales gains abroad and strength in its drinks and Frito-Lay snacks.
But the company lowered the top end of its profit forecast for its current fiscal year because of investments to expand in growing countries like China. It also expects to be hurt by changes in currency exchange rates. 
Pepsi said it earned $1.92 billion, or $1.19 a share, in the quarter, up from $1.72 billion, or $1.09 a share, a year earlier.
Without one-time items including charges to integrate its bottlers, the company earned $1.22 a share, in line with analyst estimates, according to Thomson Reuters.
Revenue in the period, which ended on Sept. 4 and was the third quarter of PepsiCo's fiscal year, rose 40 percent, to $15.51 billion, from $11.08 billion.
The revenue was helped by strong gains abroad and the acquisition of the company's largest North American bottlers this year. Revenue beat analysts' estimates of $15.38 billion.
The company completed its bottler deal for $7.8 billion earlier this year, with the goal of better controlling distribution and to be able to bring products to market more quickly.
The company, based in Purchase, N.Y., reported revenue gains across all of its business units, including beverages around the world and snacks, except for Quaker, which has been struggling in the United States.
It plans to continue expanding its snacks and soft drinks overseas by increasing investment in production and distribution. Domestically, the company is spending more to support PepsiMax, its zero-calorie version of Pepsi; other beverages; and its Quaker products, including introducing new versions of its oatmeal with a thicker texture.
PepsiCo had previously expected earnings to rise 11 to 13 percent a share for the full year, but on Thursday it narrowed that range to 11 to 12 percent. Additionally, the company said it expected foreign currency movements to hurt earnings by one percentage point, so core earnings per share would show 10 to 11 percent growth.
The chief executive, Indra Nooyi, told investors the company was seeing improvements in the economic environment. But, she added ''there is no doubt that economic uncertainty and high unemployment levels are keeping a consumer-led recovery at bay in many regions.''
Pepsi also announced it was creating a new global nutrition group so it could create new products.
PepsiCo shares fell $2.01, or 2.95 percent, to close at $66.10.

HEADLINE: S.&P. Says Cost to Care For Elderly Will Spiral

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
Credit analysts at Standard & Poor's said on Thursday that the cost of caring for the world's aging populations would be ''on an explosive path'' and could swamp the budgets of many countries in the next 40 years unless governments accelerated belt-tightening efforts that are already proving highly unpopular.
Demographers have long known that more than a billion people would reach retirement age by 2050. Standard & Poor's new research, published Friday morning in London, tried to predict how their mass departure from the work force and increasing frailty would affect their nations' economies and their governments' ability to borrow. The agency looked at the economies of 49 countries, which it said accounted for about two-thirds of the world's population. 
The research comes not long after several countries in Europe found themselves shut out of the credit markets, as lenders balked at the daunting cost of their government-paid retirement programs. When governments lose their ability to borrow, they cannot function and a crisis ensues.
Standard & Poor's said it was not predicting another all-out crisis, because its analysts believed most governments would eventually take steps to slim down their retirement programs, which include pensions -- the biggest item -- health care, long-term care for the frail and unemployment benefits.
''It is inconceivable that governments will allow debt and deficit burdens to spiral out of control,'' it stated in the report. It did not say how governments would persuade citizens that cutbacks were necessary, though.
Already, efforts to raise national retirement ages in France and Greece have led to angry protests. And suggestions in the United States that the Social Security and Medicare programs are out of balance routinely draw jeers. The United States currently spends about 10.8 percent of its gross domestic product on programs for the elderly, well below the level typical for an advanced economy and almost exactly what the rating agency found typical for emerging economies.
Standard & Poor's said that without changes, sovereign credit ratings could be expected to start falling around 2020, and fall faster from 2030 onward. When a country's credit rating falls, its cost of borrowing money rises.
The report said the mature, industrial economies in Europe were the most vulnerable, and that some might lose their investment-grade ratings. The smaller and poorer countries of Europe and the rest of the world were seen as being better able to ride out the coming demographic storm, because their economies were growing faster, and because their governments tended to have promised less of a safety net to the elderly.
''The disparities are large,'' the agency warned, citing Russia, Ukraine, Luxembourg and Japan as countries veering toward levels of government spending considered unsustainable. Japan in particular was seen as an outlier, because its economy has been deflating, and deflation enlarges debt.
China, Switzerland, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, the Philippines and India, on the other hand, were said to be at much less risk. The report, part of a series that began in 2002, recalled that by 2007, many countries recognized that they had promised more than they could deliver, and were seeking ways to control costs.
But those efforts stopped during the global financial crisis of 2008, when governments everywhere focused on keeping the world financial system from failing. The steps they took to bolster banks and financial markets added to their deficits and debt burdens, Standard & Poor's said, making it all the more urgent to prepare for the demographic shift now that the worst of the global financial crisis was over.
''In our view, the maneuvering room has shrunk,'' the agency warned.
It said many countries would make it through the demographic shift more easily if they cut their budget deficits now. The United States was cited as one of the countries with a big deficit that would find it hard to deal with the economic effects of aging.

HEADLINE: Poor Prospects for New Climate Meeting

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER and ELISABETH ROSENTHAL; John M. Broder reported from Washington, and Elisabeth Rosenthal from New York and Lisbon.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- With wounds still raw from the chaotic United Nationsclimate conference in Copenhagen last December, negotiators are making final preparations for next month's meeting in Cancun, Mexico, in a surly mood and with little hope for progress.
There is no chance of completing a binding global treaty to reduce emissions of climate-altering gases, few if any heads of state are planning to attend, and there are no major new initiatives on the agenda. Copenhagen was crippled by an excess of expectation. Cancun is suffering from the opposite.
Delegates in Tianjin, China, at the last formal meeting before the Cancun conference opens Nov. 29, are hung up over the same issues that caused the collapse of the Copenhagen meeting. Even some of the baby steps in the weak agreement that emerged from last year's meeting, a slender document known as the Copenhagen Accord, have been reopened, to the dismay of officials who thought they had been settled. 
Agreement on critical issues like short-term financial aid for vulnerable countries and monitoring and reporting of emissions by major economies appears even farther away than it was at the end of the Copenhagen meeting. At Copenhagen, wealthy countries pledged to raise $100 billion over the next decade to help the developing world respond to climate change, with $30 billion in ''fast start'' financing available by 2012. But that money has barely started to flow, and many developing nations are pressing rich countries to raise the ante, an unlikely prospect.
''What is frustrating in these negotiations is to see countries not using that as the basis but relitigating things that we resolved over the course of the Copenhagen negotiations,'' said Jonathan Pershing, the deputy United States envoy for climate change, who is attending the Tianjin meeting.
The conflict is following the familiar lines that led to the crackup in Copenhagen. Wealthy countries are insisting on deep and verifiable cuts in emissions from major developing countries like China and India, while the poorer nations are asking the rich countries to do more to reduce their own pollution and come up with more money to help the rest of the world adapt to the changes wrought by a century of unchecked carbon gases from the industrialized world.
Developing-country negotiators continually chide American officials for the failure of the United States to enact any sort of comprehensive climate and energy legislation.
China's top global warming negotiator, Xie Zhenhua, complained in Tianjin on Wednesday that developed nations were not living up to their own commitments while demanding more from the poorer countries. ''The commitments made so far are far from what we expected,'' The Associated Press quoted him as saying. ''We hope they can make dramatic reductions.''
So, after 16 years of annual climate treaty negotiations, negotiators heading for this meeting, the 16th United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ''conference of the parties'' or COP-16, are hoping not for progress but merely to avoid going backward.
''What we will be working to secure is that we should not start backsliding,'' said Connie Hedegaard, the European Union's minister for climate action.
What is important this year, she said, is to ''secure some momentum'' with agreements on less contentious topics like how to preserve the world's forests and to renew the commitments made in the voluntary Copenhagen Accord.
The mood could hardly be more different than it was just a year ago when more than 100 heads of state rearranged Christmas schedules to attend the Copenhagen conference, where some had anticipated the adoption of an international climate treaty that would commit richer countries to reduce their emissions and provide poorer countries with financial and technical help to face the impact of climate change. Instead, the meetings spectacularly fell apart under the glare of spotlights and with high-profile friction between rich and poor nations.
No such drama is on the program this year.
Todd Stern, the chief American climate negotiator, acknowledged that some countries were trying to pull back from promises made in Copenhagen. He insisted that the Obama administration stood by its international commitment to reduce emissions by 17 percent by 2020 despite the lack of action in Congress. Still, he added, ''What's important is not to have expectations that are not realistic. We are committed to making the U.N.F.C.C.C. process work. But it is a difficult process.''
After the Copenhagen meeting, Mr. Stern and others raised questions about whether the United Nations was the forum for dealing with such issues. They have quietly explored options involving far fewer countries and tackling the difficult pieces of a climate deal separately rather than as one grand package. But no one is quite ready to pull the plug on the global talks -- yet.
Many diplomats who have long been involved in the process talk about Cancun as a meeting needed for ''healing'' and ''reassurance'' to countries that had lost faith in the treaty process.
''It's very important that you get back on the bicycle and get it moving and that it doesn't fall over again,'' said John Ashton, Britain's special representative for climate change. ''We have to make progress on a few fronts without overreaching: we won't be able to get over the finishing line at Cancun. The task there is to rebuild momentum and confidence.''
Still, he and others maintain that some of the principles in the Copenhagen Accord are significant. ''I was disappointed by the utter chaos that surrounded the end of the meeting -- you could write a half dozen Ph.D.'s about what happened there,'' said Yvo DeBoer, the United Nations official who ran the Copenhagen meeting and now works as a business consultant for the consulting firm KPMG. ''But we have $100 million in finance. Major emitters came up with targets. We had 130 heads of states in attendance to show they take this seriously.''
While Obama administration officials are reaffirming the president's 17 percent emissions target, they are not sure how to get there.
''I would have loved to have legislation done now so I'd have something to show,'' Mr. Stern said in an interview. ''There is legislation, regulation, research and development, a whole suite of actions we are taking to reduce emissions. We'll get there. This is the first year of a 10-year effort.''
Mr. Stern said that countries had to understand that the United States was not the only country having trouble finding the political will to act on climate change.
''Add to this reality that here, as in so many areas of public life, it is far easier -- far easier -- to stop something from happening than to get something done,'' he said in a speech this year in Washington, ''and you start to appreciate the degree of difficulty presented by climate negotiations.''

HEADLINE: Vargas Llosa Takes Nobel In Literature

BYLINE: By JULIE BOSMAN and SIMON ROMERO; Andrea Zarate contributed reporting from Lima, Peru.

 BODY:
The Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa, whose deeply political work vividly examines the perils of power and corruption in Latin America, won the 2010 Nobel Prize in Literature on Thursday.
Announcing the award in Stockholm, the Swedish Academy praised Mr. Vargas Llosa ''for his cartography of the structures of power and his trenchant images of the individual's resistance, revolt and defeat.''
Mr. Vargas Llosa, 74, is one of the most celebrated writers of the Spanish-speaking world, an anti-totalitarian intellectual whose work covers the range of human experience, whether it is ideology or eros. He is frequently mentioned with his contemporary Gabriel Garcia Marquez, who won the literature Nobel in 1982, the last South American to do so. Mr. Vargas Llosa has written more than 30 works of nonfiction, plays and novels, including ''The Feast of the Goat'' and ''The War of the End of the World.''
The prize is the first for a writer in the Spanish language in two decades, after Octavio Paz of Mexico won in 1990. It renews attention on the Latin American writers who gained renown in the 1960s, like Julio Cortazar of Argentina and Carlos Fuentes of Mexico, who formed the region's ''boom generation.'' 
During a news conference at the Instituto Cervantes in Manhattan on Thursday, Mr. Vargas Llosa, an elegant, dashing figure with silvery hair, appeared in front of a crowd of giddy journalists, mostly Spanish-speaking, and Alejandro Toledo, the former president of Peru, who sat in the front row. Mr. Vargas Llosa is currently spending the semester in the United States, teaching Latin American studies at Princeton.
Answering questions in English, Spanish and a bit of French, Mr. Vargas Llosa called the Nobel a recognition of the importance of Latin American literature and of the Spanish language, which has acquired ''a sort of citizenship in the world,'' he said.
When Mr. Vargas Llosa was young and went to Europe for the first time, he said, ''Latin America seemed to be a land where there were only dictators, revolutionaries, catastrophes. Now we know that Latin America can produce also artists, musicians, painters, thinkers and novelists.''
The announcement of the prize was greeted largely with enthusiasm in Latin America, where Mr. Vargas Llosa is widely admired for his literary greatness but is a divisive figure because of his conservative politics. He has frequently criticized leftist governments in the region, including those of Cuba and Venezuela.
In Peru, members of Congress took to the floor to praise him. People celebrated in Arequipa, the provincial city where he was born, with Peruvian television showing a band playing the national anthem in the streets.
Felipe Calderon, Mexico's president, wrote in a Twitter message that the prize was cause for ''Latin American pride.''
But illustrating the mixed sentiment that Mr. Vargas Llosa's views elicit among some in the region, the Mexican writer Paco Ignacio Taibo II said that while the prize was ''absolutely deserved,'' Mr. Vargas Llosa himself was ''deplorable as a citizen and as a person.''
In selecting Mr. Vargas Llosa, the Swedish Academy has once again made a literary choice tinged with politics, though this time from the right instead of the left.
Recent winners of the literature Nobel include Herta Muller, the Romanian-born German novelist; Orhan Pamuk of Turkey; and Harold Pinter of Britain.
''It's very difficult for a Latin American writer to avoid politics,'' Mr. Vargas Llosa said on Thursday. ''Literature is an expression of life, and you cannot eradicate politics from life.''
In the days leading up to the announcement, the reliably unreliable speculation over who would win focused on the Kenyan author Ngugi wa Thiong'o; Cormac McCarthy; the Syrian poet Adonis; Philip Roth; and Joyce Carol Oates. The last American to win was Toni Morrison, in 1993.
The awards ceremony is planned for Dec. 10 in Stockholm. Mr. Vargas Llosa will receive 10 million kronor, or about $1.5 million.
Mr. Vargas Llosa first realized that he wanted to be a writer when he was a child, enthralled with an adventure novel by Jules Verne. He spent much of his early childhood in Cochabamba, Bolivia, then moved with his parents to a middle-class suburb of Lima. He attended the University of San Marcos in Lima in the mid-1950s -- a tumultuous time in Peru -- and later drew from that experience to write ''Conversation in the Cathedral,'' a novel published in 1969.
After college he wanted to leave Peru, and began his literary career abroad, living in London, Paris and Madrid.
His work found an international audience in the 1960s with the publication of ''The Time of the Hero,'' a novel based on a Peruvian military academy that aroused some controversy in his home country. By the early 1980s, he was one of the best-selling Latin American writers in the world, having published ''Conversation,'' ''Green House'' and the comic novel ''Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter,'' among other works.
''They're not only fantastic novels that read beautifully,'' Ruben Gallo, a professor of Spanish-American literature at Princeton University, said on Thursday. ''He's one of the authors who in the 20th century has written the most eloquently and the most poignantly about the intersection between culture and politics in Latin America.''
A brief and unsuccessful effort to officially enter the political arena came later. While Peru was besieged by high inflation and the attacks by the Maoists of the Shining Path in 1990, Mr. Vargas Llosa made a quixotic run for the presidency, opposing Alberto Fujimori, then a little-known agronomist.
Mr. Vargas Llosa was ahead in polls for much of his campaign, but some factors may have worked against him: his aristocratic bearing in impoverished Peru and his acknowledgment that in the largely Roman Catholic country, he was an agnostic.
Mr. Fujimori triumphed, and the failed bid left Mr. Vargas Llosa with a sour taste for politics in his country.
Afterward, Mr. Vargas Llosa's influence in the Spanish-speaking world became more widespread through his column for El Pais, the Spanish daily newspaper in Madrid. The column, ''Piedra de Toque,'' or ''Touchstone,'' is distributed in newspapers throughout Latin America and explores themes including literature, travel and the politics of the Middle East and Latin America.
The previous Nobel laureate of the ''boom generation,'' Mr. Garcia Marquez of Colombia, won after wide acclaim for his masterpiece, ''One Hundred Years of Solitude.'' In a twist worthy of one of Mr. Vargas Llosa's subplots, Mr. Garcia Marquez and Mr. Vargas Llosa, at one point close friends, had a violent falling out in 1976 in Mexico City, which they have yet to patch up.
The episode unfolded at a film premiere. When Mr. Garcia Marquez approached Mr. Vargas Llosa to embrace him, the Peruvian writer instead punched him in the face, giving him a black eye, an image immortalized days later by the photographer Rodrigo Moya. Mystery shrouds what happened, but apparently the feud had to do with Mr. Vargas Llosa's wife, whom Mr. Garcia Marquez had consoled during a marital estrangement.
Confusion over the enigmatic feud persisted on Thursday, after news of a Twitter message attributed to Mr. Garcia Marquez -- which read, ''Now we're even'' -- made the rounds in literary circles across Latin America. Mr. Garcia Marquez's foundation in Colombia later tried to clear things up by saying the Twitter message was not authentic.
In any case, Alvaro Mutis, a Colombian writer who lives in Mexico City and is a friend of both men, told the EFE news agency that a reconciliation between the two heavyweights of Latin literature, after 34 years of rancor, was probably not going to happen.
The news that Mr. Vargas Llosa had won the prize reached him early on Thursday morning, when he was working in his apartment in Manhattan, preparing to set out on a walk through Central Park, he told a radio station in Peru. Initially, he thought it was a prank.
''It was a grand surprise,'' he said. ''It's a good way to start a New York day.''

HEADLINE: A Bacon Cricketer With a Back Story

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
The Francis Bacon that Dr. Paul Brass knew was altogether different from the raucous, hard-drinking artist whose canvases depict distorted figures screaming to be freed from their frames.
Dr. Brass, an internist, knew Bacon as a friend and as a patient of his father's. ''The first time I met him I must have been 16,'' Dr. Brass recalled, sipping tea in a conference room at Sotheby's in London recently. He added later, ''I would occasionally treat him when my father was on holiday.''
When the senior Dr. Brass retired, his son took over the practice. ''I never liked to send fees'' -- that is, bills -- ''to friends and family,'' he said. ''And one day I received a letter from Francis saying that if I didn't send him a bill for the last two years he would have to find another doctor.''
Not only did Bacon, who died in 1992, pay by ''return post,'' as Dr. Brass put it, but he also ''was always 15 minutes early for every appointment.'' 
Over the years, as their friendship grew, Dr. Brass would make a point of going to Bacon's exhibitions. At a show at the Marlborough Gallery in London, Valerie Beston, a director of the gallery at the time, told Dr. Brass that Bacon wanted to give him a painting and that he was to choose from two in the show: one of a jet of water, the other a figure of a cricketer.
''I was tempted to opt for the jet of water, but when I told that to Francis, he said no, that painting happened by mistake when he spilled white paint on the canvas,'' Dr. Brass said. ''He told me, 'If I were you, I would choose the cricketer.' ''
So he did. But Dr. Brass has decided to sell this 1985 painting, ''Figure in Movement,'' which features one of Bacon's anguished figures, this one wearing knee pads and boxed against a black background within a sky-blue frame that is much like a cage. It will go on the block on Nov. 9 at Sotheby's in New York, where it is expected to bring $7 million to $10 million.
For the past decade the painting has been on loan to Tate Britain. It has also been included in many major Bacon exhibitions, most recently a retrospective at the Tate that traveled to the Prado in Madrid and then the Metropolitan Museum of Art last year.
Cricket fascinated Bacon, and beginning in the 1950s he would attend matches. Over the years the subject crept into several of his paintings. In ''Figure in Movement,'' however, the man's jaw line, eyes, nose, mouth and hair are unmistakably those of John Edwards, Bacon's closest companion from the mid-1970s until his death.
But the body was adapted from 20-year-old photographs of George Dyer in his underwear. Mr. Dyer was Bacon's companion until Mr. Dyer committed suicide in 1971. ''Dyer and Edwards were both patients,'' Dr. Brass noted.
A CHAGALL MOSAIC
The National Gallery of Art in Washington announced this week that it had received a bequest of 19th- and 20th-century works of art from Evelyn Stefansson Nef, an arts patron and writer who died in 2009. Besides drawings and prints by Picasso, Kandinsky, Leger and Vuillard, the gift includes a monumental mosaic created by Chagall that once adorned the garden of the Georgetown home where Ms. Nef lived with her husband, John Ulric Nef, an economic historian who died in 1988.
Chagall was a friend of the Nefs', and in 1968 when he was visiting them he told the couple he wanted to make them an artwork. ''But nothing for the house,'' Chagall had said. ''The house is perfect as it is. But I will do something for the garden. A mosaic.''
He ended up creating a mosaic consisting of 10 panels, each about 5 by 3 1/2 feet, mounted on concrete backing, which was then installed on a wall in the Nefs' garden. The center of the composition depicts figures from Greek mythology: Orpheus with his lute, the Three Graces and Pegasus. At the mosaic's lower left, there is a scene of immigrants crossing the ocean to find a new life in the United States -- a frequent Chagall theme -- and at the lower right is a pair of lovers beneath a tree.
''It screams Chagall,'' said Harry Cooper, the National Gallery's curator of Modern and contemporary art. ''When Evelyn asked Chagall if the couple in the mosaic were she and John, he is said to have replied, 'If you like.' ''
''Chagall was more comfortable working in stained glass,'' Mr. Cooper added. ''But he seems to have also been interested in mosaics.''
The mosaic is currently being treated by the National Gallery's conservators. It is scheduled to be installed in the gallery's sculpture garden in 2012.
THE NEXT BIG IDEA
When the recession hit, Lisa Phillips, director of the New Museum, said she and other organizations in downtown Manhattan ''began asking ourselves what the new normal would be.''
''We were motivated by issues of the downturn and feeling that art was being discussed as a frill,'' she recalled.
What began with a year and a half of meetings has morphed into the Festival of Ideas for a New City, a collaboration of several downtown organizations, arts groups and schools. During the weekend of May 7 there will be panels, roundtables, symposiums and workshops, as well as a street fair and dozens of art projects. The New Museum and Cooper Union will be the fair's anchors. Other organizations involved include the Architectural League, the Bowery Poetry Club and the Drawing Center.
''We are advocating for the importance of culture and thinking about the future of New York,'' Ms. Phillips said. ''Museums are centers of learning; they have become community hubs.''
NEW PHILLIPS CURATOR
Klaus Ottmann, a curator at the Parrish Art Museum in Southampton, N.Y., has been named curator at large at the Phillips Collection in Washington. In this newly created position, Mr. Ottmann will oversee the collection's Center for the Study of Modern Art, an education center established in 2007 and focused on 20th- and 21st-century work, and organize exhibitions at the Phillips.
Mr. Ottmann's position has been financed by a five-year grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.
BACK TO MOMA
After four years as a senior curator at the New Museum, Laura Hoptman is returning to the Museum of Modern Art, where she was an assistant curator in the drawings department from 1995 until 2001.
This time around Ms. Hoptman will be a curator in MoMA's department of painting and sculpture, where she will be organizing exhibitions and working on acquisitions and the display of the collection. Her main focus will be contemporary art.
Ms. Hoptman begins her new job on Nov. 1.

HEADLINE: First Buyers of an All-Electric Car Also Get a Trunkful of Perks

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC

 BODY:
Tax credits, rebate checks, personalized home visits, government giveaways -- even customer service calls from top corporate executives.
The first all-electric car from a major auto company, the Nissan Leaf, arrives at dealerships in December, but thousands of Americans are already learning that going electric can come with perks like no other car purchase.
''It just keeps getting better and better,'' said Justin McNaughton, among the 20,000 people who have reserved a Leaf. ''My wife thinks it's funny because at the end of the day, we're just buying a car.''
Since Mr. McNaughton, a lawyer in Nashville, paid his $99 deposit, he has been bombarded with government incentives -- promises of a $7,500 federal tax credit, a $2,500 cash rebate from the state of Tennessee, and a $3,000 home-charging unit courtesy of the Energy Department. 
When he had questions about the Leaf, the answers came in a 40-minute telephone call from a senior manager in Nissan's corporate planning department.
''You kind of feel like you're one of the chosen people,'' Mr. McNaughton said.
Precisely. It is all part of an unprecedented effort by federal, state and local governments to stimulate demand for cars that have zero tailpipe emissions -- and Nissan's pre-emptive bid to corner the all-electric market much the way that Toyota dominated the early hybrid market with the Prius.
The government subsidies are shaving thousands of dollars off the Leaf's $32,780 sticker price, while other benefits are piling up, like free parking in some cities and the use of express lanes on highways usually reserved for cars with multiple passengers.
In Tennessee, where a Leaf assembly plant is being built, Leaf drivers will be able to charge their vehicles free at public charging stations on 425 miles of freeways that connect Nashville, Knoxville and Chattanooga.
''It's almost shocking how many subsidies are available on the Leaf,'' said Jeremy P. Anwyl, chief executive of the auto research Web site Edmunds.com. ''We are putting a lot of money behind this technology.''
Nissan expects the typical Leaf buyer to fit a highly desirable demographic: affluent, college-educated consumers in their mid-40s who are both environmentally sensitive and willing to take a chance that electric technology will be as safe and reliable as internal combustion engines.
Better still, about 85 percent of the people who have reserved a Leaf do not currently own a Nissan, giving the brand exposure to a new audience. Interest in the car has been so great that the company has stopped taking reservations for the initial production run -- the Leaf is being built in Japan, with assembly at the new plant in Tennessee beginning in 2012 -- but Nissan has plans to sell as many as 500,000 electric cars worldwide by 2013.
The Obama administration has made electric vehicles a centerpiece of its drive to reduce the nation's reliance on oil, and is pumping up subsidies with a goal of getting a million electric cars on the road by 2015. Proponents of electric cars also point to their zero tailpipe emissions, though the electricity to charge the cars creates emissions.
So far the only electric cars available in the United States are made by small companies, like Tesla Motors, and are prohibitively expensive for most buyers (the Tesla Roadster is priced at over $100,000). Other automakers are in various stages of introducing electric vehicles to the market, and General Motors is preparing to bring out the Chevrolet Volt, a $41,000 model that runs on electricity but is not all-electric because it has a gas engine to extend its driving range.
So for now, at least, the Leaf, which Nissan claims can travel 100 miles on a single battery charge, has the stage pretty much to itself. So Nissan is dedicating extensive resources to the introduction and is taking consumer outreach to new lengths.
The company has studied potential buyers in focus groups, on Internet dialogues and at Leaf ''tour stops'' at shopping malls across the country. Nissan has even hired a firm to make ''home visits'' to prospective buyers to make sure their garages are properly equipped for charging the vehicle and to answer other questions.
''These people are the visionaries who see the opportunity and want to be a part of it,'' Trisha Jung, chief marketing manager for the Leaf, said of the customers who had reserved a Leaf. ''They will be demonstrating every day that this is a practical technology.''
Mr. McNaughton, the Nashville lawyer, said he was unaware that he had even applied for a free 240-volt charging station for his home. But by filling out a questionnaire, he was selected to be one of 5,700 new Leaf owners to get the charging unit. In exchange, he agreed to let the EV Project -- a $230 million national program financed by various government agencies, utilities and corporations -- monitor his battery-charging habits.
A 240-volt home charging unit can give the vehicle a full charge in about eight hours, Nissan says.
Ken Muir, an engineer in San Jose, Calif., had a similar surprise when he first saw the Leaf at a mall last year. After mentioning his interest to a Nissan employee, he was contacted by the head of Nissan's West Coast communications team, who arranged for Mr. Muir to get a personal test drive.
After putting down his $99 deposit, Mr. Muir met for an hour in his home with a technician from Nissan's supplier of charging stations. ''It's been really amazing to get this amount of personal attention from a huge car company like Nissan,'' he said.
He is also a bit giddy about the level of financial support he will get -- the $7,500 federal tax credit as well as a $5,000 credit from the state of California, and another $2,000 federal credit toward the purchase of a charging unit.
''I've wanted an electric car for 10 years, but I never expected it to make this much economic sense to get one,'' Mr. Muir said.
The car itself will keep Nissan connected to its customers long after they drive it off the lot. A communication module installed in the Leaf's lithium-ion battery will send data to Nissan that monitors the condition of the battery and how it is being used. ''It's not a 'Big Brother' thing,'' said Mark Perry, head of North American product planning for Nissan. If Nissan sees that a battery cell ''has behaved outside the norm, we want to call you or e-mail you and say, 'Come on in and let's check it out.' ''
The first Leafs go on sale in December in five states -- California, Oregon, Washington, Arizona and Tennessee, all of which are places where the EV Project is building charging stations.

HEADLINE: Inescapable Slide For Households

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER SWANN and JAMES PETHOKOUKIS

 BODY:
America's standard of living could turn out to be the main casualty of the debt crisis. For a decade, the middle class made up for stagnant incomes by getting ever deeper into debt. Without housing wealth to tap, a bout of inflation is one of the few alternatives to a decade of austerity.
Americans seemed to think a perpetually improving lifestyle was written into the Constitution. As the median working family income slid 8 percent from 2000 to 2009, the favorite solution was to make up for the shortfall with seemingly cheap credit. 
While much of this debt has been paid off since the financial crisis, or erased through a flurry of defaults, household debt still stands at 123 percent of annual disposable income. Even at the height of the go-go 1980s, American household debt reached only 85 percent of disposable income.
Paying it down further won't be easy. At the current savings rate -- close to 6 percent of disposable income -- getting debt down to 100 percent of disposable income will take four years. And that won't come close to restoring the $10.7 trillion of household net wealth lost since 2007.
Against this backdrop, Americans will almost surely need to cut back. Wage growth is unlikely to be more helpful than over the previous cycle. Intensifying international competition seems to have severed the customary link between improving productivity and rising wages. High unemployment is adding an extra headwind.
Nor will most Americans be able, or willing, to repeat the trick of borrowing to bridge the gap. Homeowners' equity has almost halved since 2005, reducing the collateral of households by about $6 trillion. Default is no quick fix either, since it impedes access to new credit and carries a degree of social stigma.
This leaves inflation. With debtors vastly outnumbering savers in America, a burst of faster price rises may be the most politically palatable way of eroding the real value of debt. Of course, even this option would leave the middle class at the mercy of pay increases. Add it up and many Americans look set for a stagnant, or even lower, standard of living.
Foreclosure Fallout
It's not just Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase that need fret about the foreclosure frenzy in Washington. The fallout risks further erosion of the whole industry's already shaky position in the nation's capital. Wall Street could easily find itself in the cross hairs again next year.
With financial reform passed and a bank levy looking unlikely, big banks have been anticipating some time away from the political spotlight's harsh glare. But as fast as a mortgage lender ''robo-signing'' its way through a pile of foreclosure orders, legislators are calling for hearings into charges that some financial institutions played fast and loose with procedures for reclaiming homes.
It's a bipartisan effort ahead of the midterm elections. The lead Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, Richard C. Shelby, is urging regulators and lawmakers to examine mortgage practices at Bank of America, JPMorgan and Ally Financial, formerly known as GMAC. President Obama, meanwhile, said ''no thanks'' to legislation that could have made it harder for homeowners to challenge dodgy foreclosures.
The imbroglio will surely keep the bad headlines coming for the banks involved. Many politicians will urge the stoppage of foreclosures, but there's little time left this year for Congress to do more than talk. It's on extended vacation until after the November elections and will probably focus on tax issues when it returns.
But industry lobbyists fear the repercussions of a renewed wave of public invective. The more Wall Street and its campaign cash are considered radioactive, the harder it will be for banks to influence lawmakers and regulators as they carry out the sweeping reform bill that passed last summer.
Banks, for one, would love to see a narrow interpretation of new limits on activities such as proprietary trading. And the more unpopular banks are, the greater the likelihood they will eventually be nicked with new taxes by revenue-hungry politicians. Conversely, the more politicized the housing issue, the less chance for reform of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac -- another big issue for the banks -- any time soon.
The year hasn't even finished, and Wall Street may have just secured itself another long and grueling battle on Capitol Hill.

HEADLINE: Christie Stops Train Tunnel, Citing Its Cost

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
The largest public transit project in the nation, a commuter train tunnel under the Hudson River to Manhattan, was halted on Thursday by Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey because, he said, the state could not afford its share of the project's rising cost.
Mr. Christie's decision stunned other government officials and advocates of public transportation because work on the tunnel was under way and $3 billion of federal financing had already been arranged -- more money than had been committed to any other transit project in America. 
The governor, a Republican, said he decided to withdraw his support for the project on Thursday after hearing from state transportation officials that the project would cost at least $2.5 billion more than its original price of $8.7 billion. He said that New Jersey would have been responsible for the overrun and that he could not put the taxpayers of the state ''on what would be a never-ending hook.''
In scrapping the project, Mr. Christie is forfeiting the $3 billion from the federal government and jeopardizing as much from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The state may also have to repay the federal government for its share of the $600 million that has already been spent on the tunnel.
The tunnel, which would have stretched under the Hudson from North Bergen, N.J., to a new station deep below 34th Street in Manhattan, was intended to double the number of trains that could enter the city from the west each day. The project's planners said the additional trains would alleviate congestion on local roads, reduce pollution, help the growth of the region's economy and raise property values for suburban homeowners.
The tunnel was also supposed to provide jobs for 6,000 construction workers just as some other big transit infrastructure projects in the city, like the Second Avenue subway, were winding down.
Instead, the contractors hired to dig the tunnel will soon start laying off workers.
''This was the project that I think everyone was counting on to revitalize the public-works sector,'' said Denise M. Richardson, managing director of the General Contractors Association of New York. ''For construction workers that were counting on job opportunities, it's a real blow to them.''
Mr. Christie admitted that the cancellation would be costly but he said it would be more prudent for the state to withdraw sooner rather than later. He said he also expected to be able to redirect the Port Authority's $3 billion to other projects in the state, though he did not identify any.
When Mr. Christie told Ray LaHood, the federal transportation secretary, about his decision, Mr. LaHood demanded to meet with the governor to discuss the matter further. The two were scheduled to meet on Friday, but Mr. Christie gave no indication that he could be swayed.
Mr. Christie's decision also packed a wallop for the elected officials and transit advocates who spent most of the last two decades cobbling together the design for the tunnel. Several of them criticized the governor for rushing to a judgment that they said would hamstring the region's economy long into the future.
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who had supported the project, said New York City did not have the money to help New Jersey pay for the overruns.
The tunnel was a project of New Jersey Transit. The Port Authority, which gets its money from tolls, committed $3 billion for the plan after allocating billions of dollars for the rebuilding of the World Trade Center site.
Just a month ago, Mr. Christie abruptly ordered a temporary halt to spending on the tunnel while state transportation officials reviewed its costs. The review found that the cost would probably exceed $11 billion and could be higher than $14 billion.
Some critics said they suspected that the governor had decided to divert the money in highway tolls that the state would have spent on the tunnel to road and bridge repairs. The state's fund for such transportation improvements is nearly empty and the governor has ruled out raising the state's gasoline tax to replenish it.
''Two decades or more in the planning and then 30 days or less to kill it,'' said Kate Slevin, executive director of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, a group that had advocated building the tunnel.
Ms. Slevin said Mr. Christie's sudden turnabout was unprecedented. ''We've seen delays on transit projects before,'' she said, ''but never when the financing was as solid as it was on this.''
The tunnel, known as Access to the Region's Core, or the ARC tunnel, would have been used exclusively by New Jersey Transit, the state-run operator of commuter trains and buses. The agency's trains have shared a two-track tunnel, nearly 100 years old, with Amtrak.
The tunnel was a pet project of Mr. Christie's predecessor, Jon S. Corzine, and the state's two senators, Frank R. Lautenberg and Robert Menendez. Those three Democrats were joined by some Republican legislators at a ground-breaking ceremony in North Bergen last year that was intended to demonstrate bipartisan support.
But it was left to Democrats like Mr. Lautenberg to criticize Mr. Christie for backing out of the project. ''Killing the ARC tunnel will go down as one of the biggest public policy blunders in New Jersey's history,'' Mr. Lautenberg said. ''Without increased transportation options into Manhattan, New Jersey's economy will eventually be crippled.''
Mr. Christie said he was prepared for such criticism and charges that he had flip-flopped on his position about the tunnel. But he suggested that he had been misled about the true costs of the project and who would pay for it.
Then, reinforcing his reputation for audacity, the governor called on the senators who had secured the $3 billion in federal money for the tunnel to try again, for a less costly project.

HEADLINE: Richardson Shapes New Mexico Race

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY

 BODY:
ALBUQUERQUE -- Although Gov. Bill Richardson's name is being sullied on the airwaves and in campaign debates up and down this border state, Susana Martinez, the Republican candidate to replace him, is not -- technically at least -- running against him.
Instead, Ms. Martinez, 50, who has been leading in the polls, faces Mr. Richardson's lieutenant governor, Diane Denish, 61. But voters have grown so weary of Mr. Richardson that the Martinez campaign has opted to link the two, referring to ''Richardson-Denish'' as if it were a candidate itself and even challenging Mr. Richardson, who is prevented from seeking a third term, to debate the issues with her. 
Ms. Martinez, a tough-talking county district attorney who was not widely known when her campaign began, has appeared on television criticizing Mr. Richardson's tenure as being rife with scandals and flashing a photo of the governor smiling alongside Ms. Denish. Ms. Martinez has also criticized the Richardson administration's stewardship of the economy, questioned his commitment to schools and accused him of being soft on border security.
''Four more years of the same -- or bold change,'' she said in one of her many hard-edged ads aimed at generating a big Republican win in a state Democrats have considered a sure thing.
The message seems to be sinking in with some who voted for Mr. Richardson but are now giving Ms. Martinez a look. ''I think he was doing a good job, but I think he's been falling in the last couple years,'' said Katherine West of Albuquerque, who plans to support Ms. Martinez.
Frustrating to the governor's camp has been that Ms. Denish, also aware of Mr. Richardson's unpopularity, has done little to defend him. She portrays herself as her own woman who would run her own administration, and she distances herself from the departing governor. ''Diane Denish -- A New Way Forward,'' is her campaign motto.
Mr. Richardson, 62, the country's only Hispanic governor, has largely sat out the heated contest. He did issue a news release in August after Ms. Martinez, who would be the first Hispanic woman to run a state, questioned his education record.
''After watching the debate and Susana Martinez's latest ad, she obviously doesn't know what she's talking about,'' he said. ''All she can do is make false claims about my record and continually get her facts wrong.''
That prompted Ms. Martinez to call on the governor to debate her. ''If Bill Richardson wants to defend Diane Denish and their administration's abysmal record, he shouldn't hide behind press releases,'' she said in a press release of her own. ''I am challenging Bill Richardson to a televised debate about whether we should continue the failed policies of the Richardson-Denish administration, or seek real change.''
Ms. Martinez's approach appears to be working, with polls putting her in the lead against a more established politician in a state that has long elected Democrats to the Roundhouse, as the state capitol is known.
The hard-fought race for governor, a rare contest between two women, is a high priority for both parties, with a stream of heavy hitters -- from Sarah Palin and Mitt Romney to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and President Obama -- visiting New Mexico.
''When you're making choices for governor, your choices for Senate and Congress, these choices mean something,'' Mr. Obama said in Albuquerque last week, with Ms. Denish smiling nearby. Former President Bill Clinton, who complained in 2000 about his vice president, Al Gore, not praising his administration enough in his presidential bid, is the next high-profile visitor.
Interestingly, Ms. Denish, who filled in frequently for Mr. Richardson while he ran for president in 2008, would be governor right now if Mr. Richardson had left New Mexico to become Mr. Obama's commerce secretary.
But an investigation of Mr. Richardson's dealings with contractors prompted him to pull his name out of contention. The inquiry of Mr. Richardson, Mr. Clinton's energy secretary and United Nations ambassador, is over and his name is being floated for a job in a second Obama term.
There appears to be little that Mr. Richardson, who is known for resolving tense diplomatic standoffs overseas, can do for his No. 2, whose campaign clearly views him as a liability. Her Web site skips over the once-popular Mr. Richardson, mentioning that she was elected the state's first female lieutenant governor in 2002 without noting who her boss was.
During a recent debate, after Ms. Martinez brought up the governor again and again, Ms. Denish let her frustration be known.
''My opponent, she wants to run against Bill Richardson,'' Ms. Denish said. ''I don't know how many times she has mentioned his name. I don't see him up here. Do any of you?''
He may not be visible, but his presence is nonetheless felt.
''I find it a little daunting that people accuse me of being responsible for Bill Richardson's actions,'' Ms. Denish told The Albuquerque Journal recently.
Describing the governor as ''very much a boy's boy, a man's man,'' she said she had never been a part of his inner circle.
''Have I ever been sitting out on the back porch smoking cigars at the mansion?'' she said. ''No.''

HEADLINE: Obama Will Veto Notary Bill That Could Speed Foreclosures

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES and DAVID STREITFELD; Jackie Calmes reported from Washington and David Streitfeld from San Francisco.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- As slipshod bookkeeping by some big mortgage lenders continued to rattle the housing market on Thursday, another major lender indicated it would suspend sales of foreclosed homes and White House officials said President Obama would not sign a bill that critics suggested could facilitate foreclosure fraud.
Demands for investigations and nationwide moratoriums also grew. Representative Edolphus Towns, the New York Democrat who is chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, called on lenders to voluntarily suspend foreclosures until they completed internal investigations. On Wednesday, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said that the Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force, which Mr. Obama created to examine financial fraud, is looking at the growing reports of foreclosure fraud. 
The president's pocket veto -- rejecting a bill by withholding his signature while Congress is away -- effectively kills the measure since lawmakers, who are out of town until after the Nov. 2 midterm elections, are not in position to override his decision with a two-thirds vote of the House and Senate.
The bill would have mandated that notarizations of mortgages and other financial documents done in one state, including those done electronically, be recognized in other states. By the time the bill arrived at Mr. Obama's desk, however, it was caught in the controversy over major institutions' acknowledgment of problems in processing documents for tens of thousands of foreclosures. Those included suspected forgeries and notaries' failure to review the paperwork as required.
Critics, particularly consumer groups, said the measure for interstate notarizations would have made it even easier for banks and other lenders to rush the foreclosure process. JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and GMAC Mortgage have stopped foreclosures in nearly half the states, pending investigations into the process.
A fourth major lender, PNC Financial Services Group, has also suspended sales of foreclosed homes for 30 days, according to a memo from a title insurer, Commerce Title, that works closely with the bank.
PNC is alerting title insurance companies that it is postponing the closings effective immediately, according to the memo. ''We have been given notice from PNC Legal that there is a moratorium going into effect'' on residential foreclosures, the memo from Commerce Title said.
A PNC spokesman, Frederick Solomon, declined to comment beyond saying that the lender was reviewing its mortgage servicing procedures.
PNC, which is based in Pittsburgh, became one of the country's largest lenders with the acquisition of Ohio-based National City Corporation two years ago. National City, an aggressive lender during the housing boom, collapsed during the financial crisis.
Given the outcry over the far-reaching foreclosure crisis, Congressional aides said lawmakers were unlikely to take umbrage at Mr. Obama's decision to let the notary measure expire. The White House, in announcing the pocket veto, indicated that it could work with Congress later on some alternative.
Mr. Obama's communications director, Dan Pfeiffer, said Thursday in a statement, ''We need to think through the intended and unintended consequences of this bill on consumer protections, especially in light of the recent developments with mortgage processors.''
''The authors of this bill no doubt had the best intentions in mind when trying to remove impediments to interstate commerce,'' Mr. Pfeiffer added. ''We will work with them and other leaders in Congress to explore the best ways to achieve this goal.''
The measure had sponsors from both parties and was so uncontroversial in Congress that it passed without roll-call votes -- in the House by a voice vote in April and in the Senate by unanimous consent last week.
The president's decision against signing the measure was his first veto intended to kill a bill; he has pocket-vetoed a measure once before, but only because it was duplicative of other legislation. President George W. Bush, who also came to office with his party in control of Congress, did not veto a bill in his first term.
Mr. Towns, the New York congressman, also asked the New York State attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo, to investigate accusations of fraud by the lenders. At least a half-dozen other attorneys general have already begun investigations.

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Chief Steps Into Dispute Over China's Currency Policy

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The head of the International Monetary Fund urged China on Thursday to allow its currency to rise in value, an attempt to keep a contentious issue between the United States and China from broadening into a bitter international dispute.
The suggestion was made by Dominique Strauss-Kahn, managing director of the I.M.F., who also expressed worry that the international coordination of economic policies that resulted from the global economic crisis was eroding. 
''The momentum is not vanishing, but decreasing, and that is a real threat, because everybody has to keep in mind this mantra that there is no domestic solution to a global crisis,'' he said at a news conference as around 13,000 officials, executives and other participants gathered here for the annual meetings of the I.M.F. and the World Bank.
''Many are talking about a currency war,'' Mr. Strauss-Kahn acknowledged, adding: ''What we all want is the rebalancing of the global economy, and this rebalancing cannot happen'' without ''a natural consequence of it, which is a change in the relative value of currencies.''
Responding to calls by the United States for the I.M.F. to take a more assertive role in mediating exchange rate tensions, Mr. Strauss-Kahn defended the institution, saying the I.M.F. had repeatedly stated ''that we believe that the renminbi was substantially undervalued and something has to be done to fix this problem over time.''
Without singling out China, Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the European Central Bank, made a similar point in Frankfurt.
''I think that exchange rates should reflect economic fundamentals, that excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates have adverse implications for economic and financial stability,'' he said.
Finance officials around the world appeared to take note after the United States Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, on Wednesday called the currency issue the ''central existential challenge'' facing the world economy, one that threatened to undermine the rebalancing that the major economic powers agreed to undertake in response to the crisis.
Rebalancing has big implications for the world's two largest economies.
The economic theory is that China should let its currency appreciate, which would make it easier for Chinese consumers to buy imported goods from Europe and America.
Western leaders also want China to speed its efforts to strengthen its social safety net, so that Chinese households can save less; this would stimulate domestic demand and reduce its dependence on exports.
Meanwhile, the United States, the world's largest debtor, should save and invest more and spend and borrow less -- a process Mr. Geithner says is under way.
The political reality has been far messier.
Wen Jiabao, China's prime minister, again rebuffed calls for currency appreciation this week, saying in Brussels on Wednesday that it would cause major social disruptions by harming the export-oriented manufacturing that has fueled his nation's growth.
On the American side, there has been rare bipartisan agreement on pressuring the Chinese; the House last week overwhelmingly approved a bill threatening tariffs on a broad array of Chinese imports if Beijing did not allow greater currency flexibility, as it promised in June.
Although the House bill is not expected to become law, it was intended as a signal to Beijing of American anger over Chinese imports and a loss of jobs to Chinese factories.
''We took action because nobody else would,'' Representative Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, who shepherded the bill through the House, said on Thursday. ''The best way to avoid a trade war is for there to be action, and I think we hope to stimulate that.''
Mr. Levin said ''the I.M.F. should step up to the plate,'' or else the currency issue ''will be acted upon unilaterally.''
The currency issue comes at a challenging time for the I.M.F., which played a big role in responding to the European sovereign debt crisis earlier this year but is now struggling to engage big emerging economies like China, Brazil and India.
''The fund has shown its relevance during the crisis, but it is still a question of legitimacy,'' Mr. Strauss-Kahn said, referring to a disputed proposal for European countries to surrender some of their seats on the I.M.F. board to give more of a voice to rapidly growing, middle-income countries.
The I.M.F. this week forecast that global economic growth will slow to 4.2 percent next year from an estimate of 4.8 percent this year, and that the growth will be uneven.
In Asia and Latin America, ''the crisis is over,'' Mr. Strauss-Kahn said, and even sub-Saharan Africa, which in the past has lagged the rest of the world in recovering from downturns, is growing at a faster rate than the United States and Europe.
''Contrary to many others, we don't believe that this recovery will end with a double dip,'' Mr. Strauss-Kahn said.
Mr. Strauss-Kahn said the world economy faced three other challenges beside the strains on international cooperation. Heavily indebted countries need to put fiscal reforms into effect without jeopardizing growth. Unemployment is likely to remain high. And while progress on new financial regulations has occurred, he said, ''very little has been done'' to overhaul banking supervision and crisis resolution.
But Mr. Strauss-Kahn, a former finance minister of France, suggested that rebalancing was likely to be one of the most protracted challenges.
''This problem is not going to be fixed in five minutes,'' he said. ''It is a long-term problem.''
The currency dispute has renewed speculation that a modern-day Plaza Accord -- the 1985 deal in which the United States agreed to weaken the dollar's exchange rate -- might be needed.
But Mr. Strauss-Kahn and his principal deputy, John P. Lipsky, brushed away that speculation, saying the more appropriate forum for resolving the dispute was the Group of 20, the steering committee for the largest economies, whose leaders plan to meet in Seoul next month.
