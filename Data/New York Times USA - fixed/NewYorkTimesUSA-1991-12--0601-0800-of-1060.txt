HEADLINE: Saturn Stands Out Brightly Amid the Car-Sales Gloom

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN

 BODY:
A retired Navy officer from California recently drove to the Saturn plant in Spring Hill, Tenn., to let workers know how much he loved his car and offer suggestions for future models. Another buyer liked her new Saturn so much she went to work for a dealership.
Though it's early, the Saturn car seems to be attracting an almost cult-like following. Sales, which have been strong, will grow when more cars are available and more dealers are in operation, the company says. 
 Most of Saturn's 130 dealers report brisk sales. "Demand is exceedingly strong," said Jeff Wuhlberg, part-owner of Saturn of Schaumberg, in Illinois. "We are asking for additional allocation" of cars.
 
 
Quick Customizing
 Mr. Wuhlberg said he was impressed by Saturn's ability to build models to individual customers' equipment and color preferences on short notice. Quick delivery and tailored products are also benefits of the "lean" production system at the Tennessee assembly plant.
Reviews from consumer and enthusiast magazines have been favorable but unspectacular: Saturn cars got high marks for being well put together and for delivering pleasing performance and fuel economy, but they were criticized for their engine noise and insufficient rear-seat headroom, problems that the company said it had worked on for its 1992 models.
Car sales, like movie-ticket sales, are often heavily influenced by word-of-mouth. Saturn dealers report that referrals are an important source of customers. "We've had a lot of cases where a parent buys one and then their kids come in," said Geoffrey Pohanka, a Saturn dealer in Chantilly, Va. Advertising has featured customer testimonials, partly to reinforce the word-of-mouth.
 
 
Seeking Import Customers
 By virtue of its subcompact size, advanced technology features like an optional multivalve engine, which makes the car more peppy, and a retail price of just under $10,000, Saturn has been aimed primarily at younger, better-educated buyers who value quality.
In ads, Saturn describes itself as: "A different kind of car. A different kind of company," hoping to win over buyers who might otherwise shop for a competitive foreign or American car. Saturn research indicates that 70 percent of buyers would not have bought a G.M. car if they had not purchased a Saturn. The research also shows that the most commonly cited second choices of Saturn owners were the Honda Civic and the Toyota Corolla.
Saturn searched carefully for dealers who were financially solid and had earned a reputation for satisfying customers. The dealers helped to negotiate a franchise agreement that differed greatly from those covering other G.M. dealers. Instead of receiving a franchise for only a single store, dealers won the right to geographical market areas and can add as many Saturn dealerships as they wish, in consultation with the company.
In October, when most American auto dealers were suffering from the slowest new-car sales since the last recession, 90 percent of the Saturn dealers were profitable, the company said.

HEADLINE: Stocks Rise Broadly as Dow Gains 4.69

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stocks closed slightly higher yesterday, posting gains across the broad. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 4.69, closing at 2,919.05.
It was the third consecutive session in which prices advanced solidly while investors awaited more economic news. Traders said market sentiment that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates further after a meeting of its policy-setting Open Market Committee today had a positive impact early in the day. 
 Volume on the Big Board was moderate at 172.5 million shares, compared with 201.5 million shares traded on Friday. Gaining issues outpaced losers, 1,000 to 710.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.18 point, to 212.08, while the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks was down a slight 0.01 point to finish at 384.46.
The American Stock Exchange composite rose 0.97 point, to 370.45, and the Nasdaq moved up 2.83 points, to 543.73.
 
Smaller-Stock Activity
 In smaller-stock activity, the Russell 2,000 index rose 1.04 points to close at 178.55.
David S. Chao, senior vice president-trading for County NatWest Securities, noted that while yesterday's volume was fairly light compared with last week's average of about 190 million shares, most Mondays were usually slower than other days.
"A great deal of yesterday's action was in special situations," he said, "with buying in growth stocks like Philip Morris, Coca-Cola, Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer."
According to Birinyi Associates, which tracks program trades, Union Carbide, one of the 30 industrial companies in the Dow Jones average, accounted for 80 percent of the Dow's move. The company, whose stock moved up 2 1/4, to 19 5/8, announced that it would spin off its industrial gases unit to the public.
The release yesterday of figures showing that industrial production had slipped four-tenths of 1 percent in November and that capapcity utilization fell to 79.1 percent in the month from 79.6 percent in October had little impact on stocks, Mr. Chao said.
 
Marvel Entertainment Is Active
 Among active issues, Marvel Entertainment, a publisher of comic books, rose 2, to 43 3/8. Sean D. Love, an analyst at First Boston, initiated a "buy" recommendation, saying he expects a fair amount of comic book volume growth next year despite the company's price increase in January.
Birtcher Medical Systems, a California manufacturer of electronic medical instruments and other health-care products, fell 1 1/2, to 17 1/4. Robert M. Goldman, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds, lowered his rating to a "buy-hold," from "buy." He said the stock had about doubled in the last six months and that the company recently announced that it was going to acquire Solos Endoscopy.

New President and Chief For Pacific First Bank

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER

 BODY:
Pacific First Bank F.S.B. said yesterday that it had elected John C. Dean president and chief executive, effective immediately.
A wholly owned subsidiary of Royal Trustco Ltd. of Toronto, Pacific First operates retail and mortgage banking offices throughout Washington, Oregon and California. 
 Mr. Dean, who is 44, comes to Seattle-based Pacific First from the First Interstate Bank of Washington, where he was chairman and chief executive. He succeeds Jerry Pohlman, the chief executive who resigned for personal reasons earlier this year. As president, he succeeds William D. Pettit, formerly president and chief operating officer, who has assumed a position with RT Holdings Inc., another unit of the parent company. Hartland M. MacDougall, Royal Trustco's chairman, continues as chairman of Pacific First.
Mr. Dean said in a statement that he was impressed with the financial strengths of Pacific First Bank. "Pacific First has a solid record of profitability, is capitalized well in excess of Federal requirements and has a very high-quality retail banking base," he said. "The bank has exceptionally strong financial resources and business-building capacity through its ownership by Royal Trust.
"We also have an excellent client service culture and a first-class professional staff," Mr. Dean added. "Together, these add up to a great future potential."
Mr. Dean's 18-year banking career includes 11 years at First Interstate Bancorp. He is active in the Seattle community and holds board memberships on the United Way of King County, the Seattle Symphony and the Seattle Chamber of Commerce.
He received a bachelor's degree in economics from Holy Cross College in Worcester, Mass., and an M.B.A. from the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Dean and his wife, Susan, have two children.

HEADLINE: 0.4% Skid in November Industrial Output

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 16

 BODY:
After three months of negligible change, industrial output skidded four-tenths of 1 percent in November, suggesting that the economy may now be contracting, Federal Reserve figures showed today.
Although the automotive sector was particularly weak, the decline was broadly based, and analysts said it made further cuts in interest rates increasingly likely when the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee meets Tuesday for its last regularly scheduled session on monetary strategy this year. 
 "This pretty much fits with the view that the economy is dead in the water -- or even weakening," said Samuel D. Kahan, chief financial economist for Fuji Securities in Chicago. "There's no strength anywhere."
Among the various economic indicators, industrial production tends to be among the most accurately predicted since the employment report generally published 10 to 20 days earlier tells the number of people at work and their average hours.
Yet the four-tenths of 1 percent decline in the total output of the nation's factories, mines and utilities last month was barely within the low end of the estimate range. At the same time, the industrial operating rate was reported by the Fed to have skidded five-tenths of a percentage point, to 79.1, also below most expectations.
"This is a serious sign of deterioration," Morris Cohen, an economic consultant in Hacksensack, N.J., said. "It makes me very concerned about the fourth quarter, which may turn out to be a small minus" for gross domestic product instead of a small advance.
Industrial production, although covering only about one-third of the economy, is one of the primary gauges of current business activity. Factories, in particular, have tended to swing widely with economic ups and downs.
 
Reports Show Deteroriation
 This was the latest of several reports portraying economic deterioration for November. The only notable data so far for December showed that consumer confidence, as measured by the University of Michigan, steadied during the first half of the month following an October dive.
Production of consumer goods fell five-tenths of 1 percent last month, reflecting lower automotive output and small declines in food, clothing and other nondurables. Without lower car and truck production -- at a 9.5 million annual rate, down from 10 million in October -- output of consumer goods eased two-tenths of 1 percent, the Fed reported.
Business equipment fell seven-tenths of 1 percent, with the entire decline attributable to the business share of car and truck production and to a strike at what the Fed described as a major producer of construction and mining equipment, presumably Caterpillar Inc., where a labor dispute idled half its work force. A pickup in computer production in recent months has not been enough to offset the effects of declines elsewhere, even after allowing for the strike.
Construction supplies, however, which had been declining since June, rose slightly last month.
 
Factory Output Down
 By industrial grouping, factory output fell five-tenths of 1 percent after a five-tenths of 1 percent gain in September and no change in October, with factory utilization falling six-tenths of a point, to 78 percent of capacity. Both primary and advanced processing industries posted widespread declines, with the latter now hovering scarcely above their March low.
But iron and steel output climbed for the fifth straight month even as production in most other primary processing industries held steady or eased.
Mining output was unchanged after falling six-tenths of 1 percent in October and utility output spurted nine-tenths of 1 percent because of higher demand for electricity.
At 107.8, the index of industrial production now stands five-tenths of 1 percent below its level of November 1990, or eight-tenths of 1 percent when cars and trucks are excluded. Car output last month was at a 5.7 million rate, down from 5.9 million, while truck output was 3.8 million, down from 4.1, the Fed reported.

HEADLINE: Careers;
Programs For Foreign Managers

BYLINE: By Elizabeth M. Fowler

 BODY:
AMERICAN business educators are busy training managers from abroad.
Programs at Duke University and at the University of Pittsburgh and one sponsored by half a dozen Wall Street investment firms and commercial banks are educating foreigners in American techniques. 
 The recently completed Duke program, the fourth of its kind, involved a three-week stay at the Fuqua School of Business at Durham, N.C., for 25 middle- and upper-level executives from five Soviet republics and Lithuania.
Dr. Thomas F. Keller, dean of the business school, said the participants were exposed to Western-style management techniques to help equip them for what the program has described as the "pell-mell rush toward a free-market economy."
The University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Business has a joint program in Prague under which Czechoslovak students are enrolled in a one-year management program. Afterward, they can earn master's degrees in business administration from the school by spending a semester studying in Pittsburgh.
Dr. H. J. Zoffer, dean of the school, said that among the students enrolled in Prague were one from Bulgaria, one from India, two from the United States and 21 from Czechoslovakia, including a woman associated with the Czechoslovak Republic's Ministry of Industry.
"The Bulgarian student is in the international distribution business, and the others come from such industries as heavy-truck building, locomotive building, television industry, as well as financial jobs in various industries," Dr. Zoffer said last week.
The school, known as the Czecholovak Management Center, has a campus in Prague. The program includes an internship at European companies.
Dr. Zoffer said that classes would be mainly in English but that executive development courses would be in Czech.
Tuition assistance was provided by the Czechoslovak Government, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund and two United States Government units, the Agency for International Development and the United States Information Agency, Dr Zoffer said.
Another program, sponsored by Wall Street investment firms and commercial banks, will begin in the spring. It will train 10 middle managers from South Africa, with the help of the City University of New York, said Ronald T. Gault, a managing director of the First Boston Corporation.
Mr. Gault is chairman of the steering committee for the program. He said that South African managers would work within New York companies in the six-month program, learning on-the-job techniques.
The students will attend all department meetings with their counterparts and will accompany them on sales calls, he said.
The program is tailored to the individual needs of the South African managers, he added. For example, if they need more study in quantitative analysis, the investment bank or commercial bank they work for will provide it.
Mr. Gault said that the program would include seminars and discussion groups provided through CUNY and that conversational and other communications skills would be stressed. A bibliography of books and case histories will also be available, to which the students can refer when they return to South Africa.
In New York, the companies participating include Chase Manhattan, Chemical Banking, Citicorp, First Boston, J. P. Morgan and Manufacturers Hanover, all of which will provide some financing for the program.
While plans have not been completed, the students will probably be housed in International House, adjacent to the Columbia Uninversity campus.
Their salaries, medical benefits and pension contributions will be continued by their companies in South Africa. The South African companies participating include the Development Bank of Southern Africa, National Sorghum Breweries, Southern Life Association, Standard Bank and United Bank.
The educational program was suggested by Mayor David N. Dinkins of New York City, Mr. Gault said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Off in Slow Trading And Gold Slips in New York

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar lost ground yesterday in extremely light pre-holiday trading, as falling interest rates continued to work against the United States currency.
Gold prices eased slightly after rising overseas. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $359 an ounce, down 40 cents. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $358.85, down 15 cents from the bid late on Friday. 
 Analysts said the dollar was depressed by a Government report that industrial production had fallen by four-tenths of 1 percent in November, continuing a four-month slump.
 
Could Spur Fed Action
 The report is likely to encourage the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, a bearish move for the dollar because lower rates reduce the value of dollar-denominated securities.
In addition, the German Bundesbank council is expected to raise interest rates when it meets later in the week, making marks more attractive.
"That combination spells trouble for the dollar" as investors shift funds to capture the highest yields, said Marc Chandler, an analyst at the advisory firm IDEA.
Jerry Rothman, a vice president at Merrill Lynch, said the possibility that the political troubles in the Soviet Union might be solved without violence also reduced the need for dollars. The dollar is historically viewed as a haven in times of world turmoil.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 128.45 Japanese yen, down from 128.73 yen on Friday. Later in London, the dollar fell to 128.35 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 128.40 yen, down from 129.00 yen on Friday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.8210, from $1.8165 late on Friday. In New York, it cost $1.8245 to buy a pound, more expensive than Friday's $1.8160.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's rates, included: 1.5750 German marks, down from 1.5885; 1.3935 Swiss francs, down from 1.4040; 5.3805 French francs, down from 5.4255; 1,188.75 Italian lire, down from 1,198.50, and 1.1428 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1426.
Gold rose in London to a late bid of $359.50 an ounce, from $358.60 late on Friday. In Zurich, gold rose to $359.25 from $358.90. Earlier in Hong Kong, it rose $1.30 to close at $361.05.

HEADLINE: Restoration of a Painting Worries Dutch Art Experts

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN

 BODY:
When a canvas by the American painter Barnett Newman was repeatedly slashed by a vandal at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam five years ago, many in the Netherlands feared that what had become virtually a national treasure was ruined beyond repair. Now, having seen the results of a 4-year restoration by a New York City conservator that cost more than $300,000, some fear that it is the repair that has ruined the painting.
A commission from the Amsterdam city council is scheduled to meet tomorrow to consider taking action against the conservator, Daniel Gold reyer. Last week the council received a report from a Government forensic laboratory, which the city-owned Stedelijk had asked to analyze the restoration. The report concluded that Mr. Goldreyer covered Newman's original oil paints with a quick-drying alkyd coating that is virtually impossible to remove. 
 The painting, "Who's Afraid of Red, Yellow and Blue III," is an 8-by-18-foot work from 1967, consisting of a large, luminous red field flanked by thin strips of blue and yellow. The fate of the painting has received widespread attention in the Dutch media since several experts in Amsterdam publicly cast doubt on the restoration soon after Mr. Goldreyer returned the canvas to the museum in August. Among the questions raised about the restoration is why it took so long and cost so much, when the report suggests that the restoration consisted of repainting the red field with what may have been a roller. Questions have also been raised about what the report describes as "pimples" that have appeared on the canvas since the restoration.
Wim Beeren, the Stedelijk's director, who selected Mr. Goldreyer to repair the painting, declined to comment on the laboratory's report before tomorrow, when he is to appear before the commission.
 
The Restorer's Response
 In response to the report, Mr. Gold reyer yesterday sent Mr. Beeren a sparsely worded four-page letter, which insists that "the final in-painting, point by point, was done in the original materials used by Barnett Newman." The letter acknowledges that the surface of the canvas was covered with an alkyd "seal" that was applied to protect the painting "from light and airborne pollutants." It goes on to state that the work "was not overpainted." Mr. Goldreyer notes that there were "at least 12 or 13 inspections" during the restoration by officials from the Stedelijk and others, who raised no objections.
"As far as I'm concerned, this is a vendetta," Mr. Goldreyer said in an interview yesterday, "because the conservator in the museum wanted to do the painting but she couldn't do it, so she has raised these objections." He was referring to Elisabeth Bracht, the chief conservator of paintings at the Stedelijk, who is one of the critics of the restoration. "Everything can be reversed," Mr. Goldreyer said. "If they send the painting back to New York, I will gladly remove everything done -- at their expense -- and let the museum do the restoration."
Mr. Goldreyer, a private conservator who has been restoring works by artists of the New York School since that school was active in the 1950's, has worked on many paintings by Newman, including "Cathedra" and "Voice of Fire."
"He is controversial in the field," said Carol Mancusi-Ungaro, the chief conservator of the Menil Collection in Houston, who specializes in the restoration of postwar paintings. Mr. Gold reyer is known to be private about his techniques, she said.
He also has a reputation for favoring overall, rather than localized, restorations and doing treatments that have raised questions among colleagues about "reversibility," or insuring that everything a conservator does to a painting can be easily undone, if necessary. That principal is fundamental to modern art conservation, since restorations almost always need to be redone over time. Mr. Goldreyer responded: "Because other people cannot do these restorations, because they're not capable, they accuse me of doing an overall, which is untrue. Everything I do is reversible. Everything."
 
Original vs.Vs.ersus Facsimile
 The incident highlights one of the most difficult tasks for conservators: restoring works by post-World War II artists like Newman, Mark Rothko and Ad Reinhardt, which consist of large, flat, monochromatic areas. Without radical repainting, even the most carefully restored scratch remains visible from certain angles and in certain lights. Yet large-scale and irreversible repainting of the kind that Mr. Goldreyer has been accused of doing masks the artist's original surface and results in what is essentially a facsimile.
"I stand strongly against repainting, but I can understand the impetus when a work is severely damaged," Ms. Mancusi-Ungaro said. "The problem is that while society accepts the idea that Old Master paintings can exhibit signs of aging, which includes damage of some sort, people don't accept the aging process for contemporary works. I think it is a reflection of our attitudes toward aging, in general."
Margaret Watherston, a private conservator in New York City, agrees. "Restoring areas of monochromatic color that have been slashed is one of a conservator's biggest headaches," she said. "But no responsible conservator would agree with what the report said was done: repainting a surface." She added, "It would be virtually impossible to create an illusion of an undamaged surface with a painting like this without repainting."
 
A Cornerstone of a Collection
 The work by Newman, who died in 1970 at the age of 65, is the third in a series of four works titled "Who's Afraid of Red, Yellow and Blue." Presumed to have been worth several million dollars before it was slashed, according to Sabine Ruytenbeek, a spokeswoman on art matters for the city of Amsterdam, the painting was bought by the Stedelijk in 1969 for $75,000. In the next two decades it became one of the best-known works of postwar art in what is Amsterdam's premier collection of modern art.
On March 21, 1986, a 31-year-old unemployed man tore eight big gashes through the canvas with a knife. The man, unidentified because Dutch law prohibits making public the names of criminals, later explained that he was protesting Dutch museums and abstract art. The man spent eight months in jail.
For more than a year, the museum consulted with Dutch and other conservators about whether the work could be repaired. Annalee Newman, the painter's widow, traveled from New York to examine the painting. "I almost fainted when I saw it," she said. "It was in ribbons." Mr. Beeren asked her about conservators. Mrs. Newman told Mr. Beeren that she thought Mr. Goldreyer, whom she had known for many years, "had the expertise to do it."
The director recommended him to the city council, which oversees the museum's operations, and in 1987 the council drafted a contract that included a clause stipulating that disagreements about the results of the restoration were to be settled by arbitration in the United States. If the council that begins deliberations tomorrow decides to take action against Mr. Goldreyer, the city of Amsterdam and the conservator will put their cases before an American arbitrator.
 
Another Kind of Damage
 Among those to raise doubts about the restoration after its return to the Stedelijk in August were Ernst van de Wetering, a professor at the University of Amsterdam and a member of the Rembrandt Research Project, and two Dutch conservators, Ijbrand Hummelen, a private conservator, and Mrs. Bracht of the Stedelijk. Mr. Hummelen described what Mr. Gold reyer had done as a "clumsy and false imitation" of Newman's work. Reacting to the criticisms of the restoration, the Amsterdam city council asked Mr. Beeren for a report on the painting.
Mr. Beeren of the Stedelijk supported Mr. Goldreyer, and the cost of the restoration, while acknowledging that certain questions about the restoration could not be answered without chemical analyses. He then hired the Forensic Laboratory in Rijswijk, near the Hague, which is operated by the Ministry of Justice, to perform tests on the painting.
Mrs. Newman said she was "upset that the Dutch have made this such a public thing, which only invites more damage." Mr. Goldreyer states in his letter that she "was delighted" by the restoration. After hearing about the laboratory's findings, she defended the conservator. "He did a beautiful job of putting it back together, although I only saw the painting in the dark," she said. Then she added: "I'm hoping that if he has done something to the work that shouldn't have been done, somebody will be able to bring it back to what it was. It's one of Barney's great works."

How Fake Art Is Created and Discovered and Why

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
"The Fine Art of Faking It" provides step-by-step instructions on how to create a 16th-century German masterpiece and how to determine that the one you were sold was made just yesterday. The enterprising report from "Nova" at 8 tonight on Channels 13 and 49 also tries, with less success, to explain why it matters if a Rembrandt turns out to be not quite a Rembrandt.
The focus here is on the Cleveland Museum of Art's 1974 purchase of a painting of St. Catherine by the 16th-century German artist Matthias Grunewald. Since there was only one other Grunewald in the United States, St. Catherine was considered well worth the $1 million the museum paid for her. 
 When an art historian began to have doubts, the museum turned to a German scholar, Hubert von Sonnenburg, who leads viewers through his investigation. Using an X-ray machine, an electronic microscope, chemical analysis of pigment samples and experience, he found that the base of the painting contained processed chalk not available four centuries ago and that the work did not contain any silver, which was a component of lead white paint until the mid-1800's. These and other findings labeled the work a fake.
All this is laid out in typically clear "Nova" style. Then the program moves to the Bavarian studio of a painting restorer named Christian Goller, who demonstrates how he made the 20th-century Grunewald, which was inspired by a drawing for a lost painting. It took him a week, using mostly paints available in the 1500's, such as a vibrant purple made from cactus lice. You can see him aging a work by several hundred years in an afternoon, ending up by smearing on the dirt and grime of centuries.
"Whoever calls me a forger," Mr. Goller insists, "is lying. I only paint in the style of the Old Masters. I add patina and crackle for decoration. You can't call that a forgery." He goes on: "I think copies make art accessible. Everybody can afford to hang a Grunewald in his house." Mr. Goller emphasizes that he does not add any artist's signature to what he calls his reconstructions, and he sells them for what they are. He says he is not responsible for the claims others make for them.
The processes of creation and detection laid out here are fascinating, but the question lingers: Why, except for pricing purposes, does it matter to the art lover whether the work is an authentic Grunewald or an authentic Goller? Does a work's beauty lie in its provenance?
One answer of sorts comes from Evan H. Turner, director of the Cleveland Museum of Art, which paid the million dollars for the fake: "As a matter of fact, when one passes that painting again and again it gets increasingly shallow because, you know, the factor of time as an element of connoisseurship, the fact of looking at a picture again and again; it's not unlike living with a person." He goes on in that vein and concludes, "That particular painting today is a very boring picture."
If you can get past the patina of his prose, what this expert is saying is that once you know a painting is not what it is cracked up to be, despite what seem to be its cracks of time, you look at it differently. No doubt, particularly if your museum is the one that got taken.
Granted, museums have an obligation to scholarship, but where does that leave the mere art fancier? Suppose the fake had remained unrevealed? Would Mr. Turner and others be finding increasing depth in it day after day? Isn't it somewhat unfair to the talented Mr. Goller that the painting that experts so esteemed in 1974 should be described as shallow a few years later? Doesn't it make you wonder about the esthetics, never mind the economics, of museumship?
The hour ends with a report on a disagreement at the J. Paul Getty Museum in California over the authenticity of a seven-foot Greek kouros, a marble statue of a young man from the sixth century B.C. for which the museum reportedly paid $9 million. Some art detectives say it was made recently in Rome; others say it is the real thing. Thomas P. Hoving, the former director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, predicts the work will simply disappear from view.
Won't that be a loss to those who admired it until doubts were raised? Mr. Hoving puts the issue this way: "Art is like a love affair: it's passion. And if you deeply believe that your lover is your lover and when you find out that your lover cheats on you just once, it's gone. Same thing in art." Oh? An end to love because of a single dalliance? An end to one's feelings for a beloved painting because you learn it may have been done just the other day? In art, as in life, it seems you cannot trust your eyes or your heart.

HEADLINE: Nuclear Designers From East and West Plan Bomb Disposal

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 16

 BODY:
In a first no less remarkable than others of late, nuclear bomb makers of East and West are sitting down together this week to seek ways to undo their handiwork and destroy their creations. The enterprise comes nearly a half century after the race to develop nuclear weapons began in an undertaking that for years commanded the best scientific and technical talents of both East and West.
The disabling of nuclear warheads is uncharted territory. Recent arms treaties have spelled out how delivery systems, like rockets and cruise missiles, should be crushed, burned, cut up or otherwise reduced to rubble. But none has addressed the most basic challenge of all, destroying the nuclear warheads that have kept the world on edge for so long.


GRAPHIC: The aim of the week-long effort, which started today in Moscow, is to develop rules for counting, disabling and destroying thousands of nuclear warheads. It brings together top weapon designers and arms-control experts from East and West in an uneasy alliance.
Photo: "It's a wonderful opportunity to try to influence history," Dr. David W. Watkins, a nuclear arms designer at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, said of the meeting. Dr. Watkins is one of 14 American experts here to attend the gathering.
For decades the two sides have vied for nuclear superiority and, because of that, to keep weapon secrets far from one another. Now, rather suddenly, they find themselves joining ranks to throw the nuclear arms race into reverse.
Viktor P. Karpov, a top official of the Soviet Foreign Ministry, told the American team today that its technology might "accelerate that process."
Dismantling Soviet nuclear arms has become a top priority of the Bush Administration and Congress as the Soviet Union has collapsed. Last week Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d pledged immediate aid for the effort, part of which could take till the year 2000 by some estimates. Last month, Congress allocated $400 million in emergency funds to help in the storage and destruction of Soviet nuclear arms.
The American delegation, organized by two private groups, includes arms designers and treaty experts from the Federal centers for warhead design at the Los Alamos lab and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California. The team also includes former directors of the Los Alamos lab and the Sandia National Laboratories in New Mexico, another such center.
The Soviet delegation includes nuclear bomb designers and officials from the Ministries of Defense, Foreign Affairs and Atomic Power and Industry, which oversees the building of Soviet nuclear arms.
One topic on the agenda is how to disable weapons as a first step to eventual destruction. "Soviet society is falling apart," Dr. Watkins said. "It's in our interest, in their interest, in everybody's interest, to get these stabilized as soon as possible. It would be a terrible thing, down the road, if we lost some of these weapons."
It remains to be seen whether ideas discussed here will be acted upon, and by whom. Many questions on control of the weapons have to be worked out between Moscow and the former republics.
A different issue is reciprocity with the United States. Moscow often wants the restrictive steps that it would adopt for its own weapons to apply to American ones as well, although the Bush Administration has just as often resisted such ideas.
The nuclear arms at issue include artillery shells, land mines, short-range missile warheads, air defense warheads and naval weapons.
Organizers of the American team are the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Federation of American Scientists, private arms-control groups that more than a year ago began exploring how to verify warhead dismantling, with little Federal encouragement.
"We busted our chops to try to get the Administration interested back then," said Dr. Thomas B. Cochran, a senior scientist at the resources council and a main organizer of the current meeting. "But there wasn't a flicker."
He said the Administration joined the effort at the last minute, apparently because of the sudden collapse of the Soviet Union and after the relatively recent East-West endorsement of warhead dismantling. Secretary Baker is here this week to press the same issues.
This fall President Bush and the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, announced dramatic cuts in short-range or tactical nuclear weapons and, for the first time, their planned destruction. Mr. Bush announced his initiative in September, and Mr. Gorbachev's positive response came in October. The American concern was that these widely dispersed Soviet weapons, perhaps 15,000 of a total of 30,000 nuclear arms, might fall into unfriendly hands in distant republics amid growing turmoil, a prospect Secretary Baker has called "Yugoslavia with nukes."
 
Verification Is Crucial
 So far, a central question that East and West have yet to address is how much of this promised dismantling can be verified and revealed to the other side. That is a main topic here. Other items on the agenda are finding better means of secure storage, outlining steps for destroying weapons and discussing the ultimate fate of nuclear materials, including plutonium and highly enriched uranium. Experts say the collapsing Soviet economy increases the risk that crucial weapons materials might be sold for hard currency.
Only delivery systems such as missiles were eliminated under the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Force treaty and are slated for disposal under the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, known as Start, signed in July by Presidents Bush and Gorbachev.
The exemption of nuclear arms from these accords has been faulted by both liberals and conservatives since the weapons can be recycled and used again, giving new life to the arms race. "The only good treaty," Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, once said, "is one that actually reduces nuclear weapons."
The Bush Administration, and the Reagan Administration before it, have sought to reserve the right to do what they want with the leftover nuclear warheads and materials after delivery systems have been destroyed.
Today the delegation of American experts met with officials at the Foreign Ministry and the Russian Supreme Soviet in a round of preliminary talks. The hard technical work is expected to occur Wednesday and Thursday as American and Russian experts meet in Kiev with Ukrainian officials to discuss the estimated 4,000 Soviet arms on that country's soil and the ones in other former Soviet republics. The Ukrainian effort is expected to be a test case for the wider disarmament effort.
 
How Many Do They Have?
 "We must work together with the new governments to insure a complete inventory, secure storage and eventual dismantling of these warheads," said Christopher Paine, a senior researcher with the Natural Resources Defense Council.
Remarkably, an important issue on the American side is simply to count the weapons. No one in the West knows the exact number of warheads that are deployed in Ukraine, or in Russia for that matter. Some experts suggest that even top Soviet officials may be in the dark as to the numer of weapons, because competing military groups have custody of different kinds of nuclear arms. That vagueness is seen as raising the risk of arms sales or clandestine deployments by states that arise from the ashes of the Soviet Union.
At this week's meetings, Dr. Cochran of the American delegation said he plans to promote the idea of putting a unique "tag" for identification on each nuclear weapon as well as a "seal" that would reveal any tampering with storage containers. "These measures would insure a clear chain of custody for these weapons pending their destruction," he said. The Americans have brought sample tags and seals to the meeting and plan to discuss them with officials here.
One low-tech sealing system consists of a fiber-optic cable composed of either 16 or 64 fibers that would be wrapped around a weapon storage container and then illuminated at one end. The unique light "signature" visible at the other end would be photographed. Later, in a return visit, a comparison of old and new photographs would instantly reveal if the cable had been cut or violated in any way.
High on the agenda of American arms designers is discussing with their Russian counterparts any safety systems that Soviet arms might have that would allow them to be disabled in place. In an interview, Dr. Watkins of Los Alamos said modern American weapons had several such systems, although he declined to discuss them. He added that an open discussion of design issues by Russian arms designers might be "very difficult" because of the secrecy that veils such programs.
 
How to Store Weapons
 But today Mr. Karpov, of the Foreign Ministry, told the American team that it was possible to develop disabling methods that would leave design secrets intact.
Another focal issue here is how to safely store weapons that are awaiting dismantling. Officials of the Soviet Ministry of Atomic Power and Industry, while visiting Washington in October, said that because there was no money for building new central storage facilities, some short-range weapons might have to remain in dispersed areas until the turn of the century.
Such statements helped prompt the $400 million in American aid for arms storage, transport and destruction here.
A final issue is what to do with nuclear materials after warheads have been taken apart. In its current weapons and far-flung stockpiles, the former Soviet Union is estimated to have 700 to 1,000 tons of plutonium and highly enriched uranium, a vast amount of weapons material.
One plan would be simply to leave the material in well-guarded storage areas under international supervision.
Dr. Thomas L. Neff, a member of the American delegation and a physicist at the Center for International Studies of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has suggested that highly enriched uranium-235 could be diluted with natural uranium and processed for use in commercial nuclear power plants. Processing plutonium in such a manner is considered less attractive because most countries shun reactor fuels that contain plutonium.
Dr. Neff has also suggested that the United States should consider buying the uranium reactor fuel, which could cost billions of dollars. Otherwise, he says, former Soviet ministries might flood commercial nuclear fuel markets and destroy critical Western industries.
 
Problems of Uranium Sales
 Already, the Soviets have been selling unusually large amounts of natural and enriched uranium in Western commercial markets. The sales have fed a downward price spiral that has driven some uranium producers out of business and threatened the uranium enrichment business of the Federal Energy Department, the world's largest supplier of commercial fuel.
In a final method of destruction, some Russian experts have suggested that retired arms be incinerated in nuclear blasts deep beneath the ground. A Moscow-based trading company, Chetek, which has ties to the Ministry of Atomic Power, has recently been set up to explore the commercial use of nuclear explosions for such purposes as eliminating toxic wastes.
At a reception Sunday night, Chetek officials told the American delegation that a single underground blast might destroy as many as 5,000 nuclear cores from retired warheads.; Chart: "The Path to Safety: Disposing of Weapons" shows how to dismantle a nuclear weapon (Source: Federation of American Scientists) (pg.

HEADLINE: In Chile, Galaxy-Watching Robot Seeks Measure of the Universe

BYLINE: By MALCOLM W. BROWNE

DATELINE: CERRO TOLOLO, Chile

 BODY:
SCIENTISTS at this remote mountaintop observatory have developed a new machine for measuring the distances to far-away galaxies and hence assembling a new map of the mysterious large-scale structure of the universe.
The machine, attached to one of the world's largest telescopes at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory, allows astronomers to measure distances to 24 remote galaxies at a time. 
 Measuring the distance to far-away galaxies is extremely difficult. But it is essential if astronomers are to understand the overall structure of the universe. Distances have been estimated for only a few of the billions of galaxies strewn across the universe. Astronomers are developing new yardsticks for improving their estimates of galactic distances. But the principal way at present is to gather light from a galaxy and break it up into a spectrum of colors with a device called a diffraction grating.
The lines in each galaxy's spectrum are shifted toward the red by an amount that depends on the galaxy's speed of travel away from Earth. Because of the universe's expansion, the speed of a galaxy's recession is also a measure of its distance from Earth.
But light reaching the Earth from a galaxy billions of light years away is very faint, and when broken up into a spectrum, each part of that spectrum is fainter still. Only an enormous curved mirror, such as the four-meter-diameter one in this observatory's main telescope, can gather enough light from a very faint galaxy to measure its red shift.
Even this huge mirror is not an effective solution to the problem since it takes many minutes of exposure to measure the light from one galaxy, and a whole night's work to produce just a handful of distance measurements.
So Dr. Thomas E. Ingerson, a physicist on the staff here, with the help of a team of Chilean engineers and machinists, has built a cunning device that allows the four-meter telescope to measure up to 24 galaxies in the time it used to take to measure just one.
Light from the big mirror is brought to a focus at the other end of the telescope on an array of 24 robotically controlled arms, each one carrying a pair of optical fibers. Working at a bank of computer consoles in the telescope control room, Dr. David Koo of the University of California at Santa Cruz and other astronomers can now maneuver each of the 24 arms of the device to place an optical fiber at the exact spot where light from a target galaxy is to be focused by the telescope mirror.
The device is known as the Argus, after the 100-eyed giant of Greek mythology.
When the "run" is begun, light from each galaxy is piped from the telescope along its own fiber to a lower floor of the observatory building, where it hits a diffraction grating and has its spectrum automatically measured by a "charge-couple device." This device, embodied in a light-sensitive electronic chip the size of a thumbnail, measures the photons of light harvested by the telescope far more efficiently than did the photographic plates that astronomers used until about a decade ago.
The measurements taken by Argus are transmitted back to the control room where Dr. Koo's associate in this project, Dr. Christopher N. A. Willmer, an astronomer from the Lick Observatory at Santa Cruz, subjects them to computer analysis. Within minutes the computer program calculates the red-shift distance of distant galaxies, and the measurements accumulate rapidly.
 
Like Tubes Into Cheese
 But each spectrum must be examined with an expert eye to weed out useless objects measured by accident. Dr. Koo discards objects that turn out to be mere stars. At a recent observing session he also had to discard a previously unknown quasar, some 8 billion light-years away, that fell into his telescope net because it had looked superficially like a galaxy.
Dr. Koo and Dr. Willmer, unlike many other galaxy hunters, confine their search to a "needle" corridor extending into the depths of space far beyond a "Great Wall" of galaxies that has been extensively investigated. By studying very distant galaxies in this thin core, Dr. Koo and Dr. Willmer get a sample like those that food testers obtain by thrusting sharpened tubes into wheels of cheese. Their needle also reaches to a great distance from the Earth -- some 8 billion light-years -- at which the light from galaxies is just barely detectable by the largest telescopes.
By making distance measurements to many galaxies lying along a thin line from the Earth to the outer reaches of the universe, Dr. Koo and Dr. Richard Krone of the University of Chicago discovered three years ago that in one direction, at least, the clusters of galaxies, each containing hundreds of millions of stars, seemed to be concentrated in evenly spaced layers. Whether this was just a fluke or actually means that some kind of layering pervades a large part of the universe remains to be determined from many more measurements -- perhaps millions of them -- and astronomers agree that answers are likely to be complex.
 
'Just an Observer'
 Dr. Koo and a colleague are now making more measurements to provide at least some tentative answers. Other astronomers, many of them doubtful that layering is a general feature of the universe, are examining the problem in different ways. "I'm just an observer, and I am not attempting to explain the data," Dr. Koo said. "In any case, we don't see this kind of regular spacing of layers when we look in some other directions although there are hints of it in others. It's certain that we're seeing interesting structure of some kind at great distances."
By taking core samples of the universe in several different directions, Dr. Koo and other scientists hope eventually to build up a greatly improved picture of the universe's large-scale structure. This they believe will help explain how galaxies evolved from the earliest epic of the universe to the present.
However Dr. Koo's project turns out, optical fiber devices like Argus clearly have a great future in astronomy. "This has given astronomers a powerful time-saver certain to hasten the pace of discovery," said Dr. Mark M. Phillips, acting director of the observatory.

Computing The Means To Enjoy Retirement

BYLINE: By L. R. SHANNON

 BODY:
RETIRE ASAP is described as software for baby boomers, a financial planning program in a box. You tell it how you are doing now, and it tells you what you have to do to enjoy a comfortable retirement.
Unlike other financial planning programs, Retire ASAP deals strictly with retirement; it will not balance a checkbook or figure the interest on a loan. Elizabeth Kernan, the president of Calypso Software of Redmond, Wash., the publisher, is a graduate of the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
 The opening screen is a map of the program's five main sections: Personal Information, Retirement, Current Retirement Situation, The Bottom Line and Once You Retire. The first time, the program guides you through the first four sections, asking for information like income, investments and expenses. It would be well to have pay stubs and other receipts and documents handy, although estimates may serve. The program itself must make educated guesses to calculate, for instance, estimated Social Security benefits or the effects of inflation.
The Bottom Line, to let one section of the program stand for the whole, has four subsections, titled Your Savings, Your Investments, Other Things You Can Do and The Next Steps. Each of these subsections leads to sub-subsections. The Your Investments category, to pick one, is divided into Your Current Investment Mix, A Proposed Investment Mix and Comparing Investment Mix. Just as with any other spreadsheet, investment mixes can be experimented with to see what combination yields the best theoretical return, balanced against a level of risk that will not give you the jitters. In addition, the program has a What If screen for experimenting with up to 10 different retirement scenarios.
Aside from the five sections that are the heart of Retire ASAP, there are two informational features. One is the ABC's of Investing, a primer for those of us who are not quite sure what a bond is. The other is a list of helpful resources, with descriptions, from the 800 number for the Social Security Administration to recommended business publications to ElderHostel, the travel and educational organization for people 60 and older.
Retire ASAP requires a computer running MS-DOS 3.0 or later, 640 kilobytes of internal memory and at least two megabytes of space on a hard disk. A mouse is optional. The telephone number for more information, or for ordering, at $99, is (800) 225-8246.
 
Dream Houses
 Now that a comfortable retirement is assured, it is time to build a snug hideaway, or remodel the present one. Floorplan Plus, from ComputerEasy of Tempe, Ariz., makes such projects straightforward, if not exactly easy.
Floorplan Plus occupies the middle ground between drawing programs, which are relatively inexpensive and can be used to draw anything but are generic, and CAD (Computer-Aided Design) programs, which are expensive and intended for engineers, architects and other professionals and can be tailored for specific tasks.
With Floorplan Plus, you can draw walls, wires and pipes, lines, circles and other geometric shapes by selecting them from menus, in either the metric or American scales. Representations of furniture, appliances, landscaping and more can be placed on the screen, moved and flipped, and, when things are finally right, printed out on any standard printer. You can also draw your own objects. It all works, Windows-style, from a screen with options along the top and tools along the left side although the program will not in fact work with Microsoft Windows. (They both want to take over a computer's basic functions.)
At first I was put off by the manual, which plunges into the details of the program with little preamble. But back on page 59, there is an 11-page tutorial that guides the beginner with a lesson on drawing a simple floor plan. After you understand the basics of the program, turn to chapter 10.
Working out the details of a floor plan before actually moving any furniture or knocking out walls is the most obvious use. But, according to the company, the program is used by caterers to present proposed layouts of tables and chairs to clients, by fire departments to record the location of sprinkler valves and even by a sea captain as a guide for loading crates. Anyone whose job involves planning or presenting a space containing objects could probably find a use for it. It can handle scale models of structures as large as 5,200 feet by 5,200 feet and is said to be accurate to a sixteenth of an inch.
Floorplan Plus is for computers running DOS 3.0 or later with 640 kilobytes of memory and a hard drive with three megabytes of free space. A mouse is not essential, but things are easier with one, and expanded memory will be used if available. It is $79.95, and is available at many software outlets or directly from ComputerEasy at (800) 522-3279.

As the Mets Turn: Plot Heats Up

BYLINE: By Richard Sandomir

 BODY:
The Mets were a bad television program in 1991, a 161-episode flop. As a soap opera, they were dishwater dull. As a sitcom, they were humorless.
So in came the new executive producer, Al Harazin, trying to be the Brandon Tartikoff of baseball, turning around his series as Tartikoff overhauled NBC's prime-time schedule. He has brought in new cast members like Barry Bonilla, Bret Saberhagen and Eddie Murray to complement Doc Gooden and Howard Johnson. 
 Bonilla and Saberhagen are hot players who jump off the screen. (O.K., maybe they're not as hunk-hot as Luke Perry of "Beverly Hills, 90210," but they're still generously heated.) Bronx-born Bonilla brings his electric smile, his 101 runs batted in and his playoff experience. Saberhagen's white-hot intensity is icing on his two Cy Young awards and one no-hitter.
Calling the games should be less wearing for the WWOR and SportsChannel crews. "I try not to get caught up in the success or lack of success of the team," said WWOR's Tim McCarver, "but I'll probably have more fun because you talk and project more positively when the team wins."
McCarver said the Mets of the past few years evinced little joy -- a baseball and television sin exacerbated by losing more games in 1991 (84) than they won (77). "They appeared to have little animation or movement or joy," McCarver said. "But Bonilla is an entertainer. He loves to play. And Saberhagen is joyful."
By being in two straight National League playoff series, Bonilla is a more renowned player-performer than Saberhagen, whose best-known television moment may have been when he sat on the bench during the 1985 World Series, patting his stomach for the cameras to signify the impending birth of his child.
Paul Splittorff, the Royals' announcer, said Saberhagen won't disappoint. "He wants to create a mismatch with every hitter," he said. "He wants to dominate."
If Bonilla and Saberhagen key a Mets revival, the results will show in WWOR's and SportsChannel's advertising and ratings. Not that the Mets telecasts have repelled sponsors, but an improved on-screen product that rebounds from, for example, last year's 14 percent ratings dip at WWOR, could attract more commercial cash despite the current advertising recession.
"The advertisers who were indifferent before are accelerating their commitments to Mets baseball, short and long term," said Tom Ryan, vice president and general sales manager of WWOR.
Mike Siegel, senior vice president of Vitt Media International, a buyer of television advertising time, said, "Advertisers will probably look less for cuts in pricing and accept some kind of increase," from WWOR and SportsChannel.
"I'd think it will also have the effect of driving down Yankees prices," he added. "Actual audience deliveries on Mets games will be tempered with optimism."
 
What Vincent Meant
 Clarification: Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent did not question CBS's and ESPN's honesty regarding losses on their television deals during baseball's winter meetings last week, as this column described his remarks to the owners last Friday. Vincent said their red-ink blues might be real, but were balanced by other concerns.
For CBS, baseball's benefit is in "maintaining affiliate relations and network integrity," which he said outweighs the effect of the losses. For ESPN, it was "to dominate cable programming throughout the summer."
The closest analysis of Vincent's speech does not alter the fact that CBS and ESPN officials are steamed at how he boldly chastised them, and how he cavalierly said about baseball's effect on ESPN, "There are only so many tractor pulls and billiard matches you can televise."
Vincent is angry at CBS's and ESPN's complaints about their losses and a paucity of CBS baseball on-air promotion. The most critical network executive of all about the CBS deal has been Dick Ebersol, the president of NBC Sports, which was overbid by $400 million for the baseball rights.
CBS and ESPN's losses effectively devalue what will likely be paid for baseball rights when their deals expire after the 1993 season, hardly sweet music to Vincent.

A Solution For McRae Vs. N.C.A.A.

BYLINE: By IRA BERKOW

 BODY:
ALL we need in order to understand that lumbering ox called the National Collegiate Athletic Association is to observe how it has handled the case of Conrad McRae, a lengthy junior at Syracuse University.
McRae is more visible than most Syracuse students because, first, he stands 6 feet 10 inches; second, he is often seen before crowds of 20,000 at the Carrier Dome as the center on the school basketball team, and, finally, he has recently been the center of a legal battle that puts the whole absurd world of college big-time sports in focus. 
 The N.C.A.A. earlier this year charged that Syracuse improperly recruited McRae when he was a high school student at Brooklyn Tech. It said that he was fed illegally by Syracuse coaches -- that is, taken to off-campus food emporiums, and that he rode in a car to Syracuse with an unofficial representative of the university, and got tickets to the school's basketball games. The fact that McRae, as a high school student, spent $20 for gas and tickets on each of several trips was taken by the N.C.A.A. as payments "well below market value."
Of course he should have paid more, $22.50, or $32.95, or something, since we all know what inflation has done to the cheeseburger and the bleacher ticket. All of this was brought out by Syracuse University itself recently, but only after a local newspaper had published reports of nefarious dealings that included enticing large people like McRae to attend its pedagogical paradise.
Now, the N.C.A.A., a monster organization that was devised to oversee that all of the hundreds of member schools woo the high school athlete fairly, says the business with McRae gave Syracuse a substantial recruiting advantage. The way to rectify it, it figured, is to penalize the school by not allowing McRae to play for it.
The catch here is that McRae will be penalized, too, even though, as the N.C.A.A. says, he was an unwitting participant in the violation. The N.C.A.A. ruled, however, that McRae could transfer to another school and play basketball there immediately, rather than sit out a year as an ordinary transfer would.
As a result, McRae is suing the university and the N.C.A.A. (the university, to stay within the confines of the N.C.A.A., went along reluctantly). McRae thinks this is a loutish idea because, as The New York Times reported last Saturday: "I want to graduate from Syracuse University. I'm a communications major. We have one of the best schools of communication in the country."
McRae, who is scheduled to graduate with his class after four years of undergraduate work, added: "The N.C.A.A. always complains about athletes wanting to transfer because their coach is leaving, or for some other reason related to sports. They say you go to school because you want a degree, not because of the coach. So I find it kind of ironic that these same people want me to leave school in midsemester, interrupt my academic schedule, the friendships I've built. Then they say they're doing me a favor because I can play basketball right away."
Either this guy has better speechwriters than President Bush, or he is so well-spoken, and so thoughtful as to be a credit to his school. And if that is the case, he honors them in a way that they have not honored him in this suit.
Meanwhile, the N.C.A.A. and Syracuse and McRae are in and out of courts, dealing with injunctions and restraining orders, and McRae has played and not played this season depending on the most recent court decision.
The N.C.A.A., glued to its book overflowing with rules and regulations, should be more concerned with the education of the individual student than the rampant idiocies of big-time college sports.
Big-time college sports is professional sports, and few besides the N.C.A.A. even pretend it is amateur. The only thing amateur about it is the N.C.A.A. itself.
One solution for the clanking N.C.A.A. would be to dissolve itself, like the Soviet Union, and then let all of its members fend for themselves in their separate little commonwealths, or conferences. Short of that, it should at least allow McRae peace. Let him finish his schooling and his basketballing at Syracuse, and then if the N.C.A.A. is still itching for action against a school like Syracuse, punish it in another way: after all of its current recruits play out their eligibility, remove varsity basketball for the next 15 years or so. No problem.
The N.C.A.A. would then release this statement: "Basketball should be confined on campus to intramurals anyway, or at least to the level played, say, in Division II. We'll leave the rest to the National Basketball Association. Happy holidays."

HEADLINE: Albany Junk Mail Flows On Like the Hudson

 BODY:
To the Editor:
It is almost laughable, the picture you paint in "El Al D'Amato" (Topics of The Times, Dec. 4) of Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato feeding twice at the franking trough from 35,000 feet aloft. Aboard an El Al plane returning from a look-see mission during the Iraqi war, he had the political sensitivity to draft one letter to his Jewish constituents and a different one to the rest. It's a long flight, after all. Both were mailed at public expense. 
 The franking privilege lives in Albany, too, although perhaps not so finely targeted. Last week I received a handsome two-color booklet summarizing the New York law of tenants' rights, with a state senator featured on the cover as the sender. This familiar political junk mail hit a very flat note this time.
Last September, the New York City administration laid me off from a revenue-generating managerial position, where I was promoting economic development and job creation. For budget reasons -- and remember that an important part of the city's budget comes from the state -- I was cashiered along with 31 colleagues. So, with the city facing double-digit unemployment, at a time when its economic development efforts should be redoubled, it is dismissing people like me, while its sovereign in Albany pleads penury.
But the junk mail flows on down as inexorably as the Hudson.
You don't have to be a wise man in this season to be frankincensed by your mail. I guess it's too much to expect our legislators, with their formidable electoral advantages of incumbency, to ban their own mailing privileges. In some states, however, government publications are required by law to bear a legend stating how many copies were printed and distributed and at what public cost.
If our New York State legislators would adopt that simple reform, we would all be in a better position to exercise our voters' rights next November.

HEADLINE: Russians Really Need Management Help

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Right before leaving for Kennedy Airport to catch my Aeroflot flight home to Moscow, I read "Help Russia Now" by Anders Aslund and Richard Layard (Op-Ed, Dec. 5). I hope this article influences those who can help in ruble stabilization. The matter is of utmost importance: the unstable Russian economy will undoubtedly lead to political upheaval and send waves around the world. But a growing Russian economy, with markets open to Western trade and employment, will stimulate Western economies. Western help now will reap great dividends in the nearest future. 
 Ruble stabilization is most important, yet other assistance is urgently needed. Though money, food and machinery will bring temporary relief, our main illness is the lack of management mechanism. Centrally directed methods of management have been given up, but the market mechanism has not been adopted. Western economists have tried to help us organize the market mechanism. The advice was right: free prices, give a free hand to business activity, privatize state property. Unfortunately, we were unable to carry it out.
Can a Soviet plant director, who has never worked under market conditions, turn into an active businessman instantly? Can a Soviet banker, who for years worked under orders, become a market follower in days or months? Our tragedy is that we have almost nobody to replace these people, and there is no time to wait for a new generation to grow up.
The best way then to help Russia (once the ruble is stabilized) is to send American manager-consultants to the large plants of Russia. They could help reorient each plant to market operation and at the same time train Soviet managers and give them basic knowledge of management under market conditions.
These managers should be supplied by an agency created specifically for the purpose. The agency can be financed from the resources of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, by private investors and from Russian resources. The best human resources for such an agency would be Soviet emigres who know the language, traditions and customs of our country and are well versed in free enterprise by now.

HEADLINE: Bush Wisely Goes Slow on Economic Change

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The day after the election of 1988, President Bush met the press and recalled the name of Martin Van Buren, the last sitting Vice President to be elected to the Presidency 152 years before. The recollection was somewhat ominous, since Van Buren was a one-term President, defeated in his bid for re-election by the inferior William Henry Harrison. Van Buren is rated by some competent judges as one of our cleverest and best chief executives. Certainly, his autobiography is a most remarkable document in American political history. 
 The reason for recalling this now is that during Van Buren's term of office, in 1837, the United States suffered what is described as its first major economic depression, and the way he handled it (or refrained from doing so) may be instructive for a successor. There were urgent calls for a special session of Congress, which he opposed but was finally persuaded to convene. The papers were filled with the most pathetic stories of human suffering, and the pundits of the day called for peremptory action to plan the nation's future instead of harking back to its glorious past.
Van Buren refused to be stampeded by the sentimentalists into mindless action. In the message he sent to Congress, he described the primary cause of the economic disturbance as "a spirit of reckless speculation," which had resulted in "the rapid growth among all classes, and especially in our great commercial towns, of luxurious habits, founded too often upon merely fancied wealth."
Van Buren stated that "those who look to this Government for specific aid lose sight of the ends for which it was created, and the powers with which it is clothed." He continued: "It was not intended to confer special favors on individuals or on any classes of them. All communities are apt to look to Government for too much, especially at periods of sudden embarrassment or distress. But the framers of our excellent constitution acted on a sounder principle. They wisely judged that the less Government interferes with private pursuits the better for general prosperity."
Holmes Alexander, biographer of Van Buren, calls this message "one of the most admirable state documents ever penned in America," comparable to Washington's Farewell Address and the Monroe Doctrine.
Yet when President Bush takes a similar stance and speaks of reliance on the natural rhythms of economic activity to restore our business health, he is mocked by Op-Ed wiseacres, who know no more about the problem or how to solve it than anyone else does, and perhaps less. Though Van Buren's course was not calculated to lead to political success, it has contributed to his historical reputation as one of the rare persons ever to reach high office who preferred being right to the Presidency.
Is it too much to suggest that Mr. Bush and modern Republicans might do worse than heed the traditional wisdom and principles of their party, as voiced by the great Democrat Van Buren, so much needed nowadays to counterbalance the conventional cant of the age of the welfare-state? How ironic it would be if the socialism increasingly rejected by the rest of the world found an unexpected home here!

Letter From Moscow

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL; Russell Baker is on vacation.

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
Every day here is so full of fear and hope, rising and fading, so many startling things happen so erratically, the present is so taut and the future so murky that life sometimes seems like the day itself -- cold, fogged over, too suddenly dark.
The city and its people seemed hard and remote at first. Then I remembered the habit I had as a foreign correspondent -- trying to jump out of the limitations of my own head by thinking local. So I practice thinking like a Russian -- not masses of Russians but just one, say a teacher in a high school. 
 As a Russian, I tell you my gorge is rising and my half-empty belly fills itself with anger. Yes, part of my anger comes from the lines, lines, lines. They make me feel grungy and poor and abused every day of my life. But I know I won't starve and I am tough. The deeper part of my anger comes from something else.
I am an educated man, a cultured man. But they -- Yeltsin, Gorbachev, all of them, they insult me every day. They don't tell me what is happening to me and my country.
Who runs this new thing, this union? What is its name and what will it be called next week? Who makes the laws? Are there laws?
Next week, what will I have to pay for bread? For a dress for my little daughter, if I can find one in the street market? What will I be paid for my job? Will I have a job? If not, who will feed my family, in Heaven's name?
Glasnost! Now it means telling me what they have decided. I thought it meant telling me beforehand, asking what I thought of a plan. But there is no plan, just decisions. I see these men on TV sometimes talking to journalists, but never to me straight on. They are acting already like the arrogant Communist czars they were just yesterday.
Never mind; I will hold on a while. I am a Russian, tough. Even the Germans were afraid of us. I know what freedom means; what fool doesn't? The world thinks I will turn to fascism unless I get some hope. No, not I, or my friends. But others will, the army generals, the K.G.B. officers, ready and waiting.
Yeltsin, or whoever, must hurry up and tell us what they plan for us, and maybe even ask our opinion. If not, they will be finished and so will our dreams. But I have hopes; things will get better, I am sure, I think.
Now I am back in my own, American, head. I check my thoughts with some real Russian heads. They say that's about the way it is; no great Moscow mysteries anymore.
Outside, the West cries doom for this place. I find myself believing Russia can pull it off, so can the Ukraine and most other republics.
There will be trouble, maybe shooting someplace. But nothing except fascism can match Communism for cruelty, criminal waste and murder.
True, fascists are waiting. But they can be blocked -- by Boris Yeltsin, if he has the courage, and by the U.S. Mr. Yeltsin's job is to come out fighting against the Russian fascists. He has to take them on as he did Mikhail Gorbachev, but he seems afraid of them, as Mr. Gorbachev was himself.
So far he has been mealy-mouthed about Pamyat, the Russian fascist organization, and never seems to notice that army funds finance some of the anti-Semitic propaganda, Hitlerian filth.
President Bush can help prevent a fascist takeover by announcing now that the U.S. will do everything possible politically and economically to destroy it -- including denying any republic's putsch government a seat at the U.N.
If fascism is fought in advance, the road should lead up. Why not? The republics could be sleek with meat, grain, oil, gold, timber when their riches no longer lie rotting in the genetic corruption of Communist production and distribution. The system could deliver military shuttles to space but not milk to children 50 miles from the farm.
In Moscow these days it seems so grievously past time that the U.S. stops seeing the end of the Soviet Union as an unknowable threat but as a reward to the people for decades of known suffering.
From what the Bush Administration is saying and doing now, maybe that is taking hold in Washington. I certainly pray so, as an American, and also my Russian head.

HEADLINE: The Synagogues Found Unemployment Nearby

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your Dec. 7 front-page report that 8.5 million Americans are unemployed is painful news. It is even more distressing for New Yorkers, with a rate higher than the national average and more than 440,000 jobs lost in this state in the last two years. 
 To alleviate some suffering, the New York Board of Rabbis asked its 800 members to announce the establishment of a job bank for unemployed congregants. The announcement was made on Yom Kippur in many synagogues.
As of Dec. 1, 290 unemployed congregants requested help in finding jobs. The list includes doctors of philosophy, lawyers, engineers, certified public accountants, middle-management personnel, computer experts, secretaries. Sadly, only 22 job opportunities were brought to our attention. We prepared a letter and circulated it among our membership to make some matchups.
Thus far we have succeeded with a few, but the odds are staggering, and we are frustrated.
How long will it take for our Government to address the plight of the unemployed before the human tragedy that they bespeak overwhelms us all?

HEADLINE: Bush Wisely Goes Slow on Economic Change;
His Failures Abroad

 BODY:
To the Editor:
We must dispel the myth that George Bush has been exemplary in his conduct of United States foreign policy, which you repeat in "The Partial President" (editorial, Nov. 24). In reality, his foreign policy has been as disastrous as his domestic policy. 
 A successful foreign policy would be marked by avoidance of wars through peaceful resolution of international problems. This would require the skillful use of diplomacy, nowhere evident in the Reagan or Bush Administrations.
Since 1981, under Ronald Reagan and George Bush, the United States has been largely responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands through participating in and supporting wars in Nicaragua, El Salvador, Angola, Afghanistan, Iran, Lebanon, Grenada, Panama, Libya and Iraq.
The Persian Gulf war was the ultimate outrage. For years we had supported Iraq, providing Saddam Hussein with arms and intelligence. In 1988 we blocked a United Nations Security Council resolution condemning Iraq's use of chemical warfare. Yet when George Bush believed it was in his interest, he manipulated the Security Council into supporting his brutal war in the gulf.
Mr. Bush eschewed all diplomatic means to achieve a peaceful resolution, including the efforts of Mikhail S. Gorbachev. When Saddam Hussein unconditionally released all his foreign hostages as part of his secret offer to end the gulf crisis, Mr. Bush's response was merely that now it would be easier for him (one less obstacle) to use force against Iraq.
There are countless victims in the world still suffering from what you term the "shrewdness, energy and values" of the Bush foreign policy. Let us hope that he will not have the opportunity to transfer these traits to his domestic policy. There has been no compassion evident in the Bush Presidency.

HEADLINE: Bush Wisely Goes Slow on Economic Change;
Concern in This Season

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"White House Memo: Adrift in Bush's Circle Seeking the Common Man" (Dec. 1) reports: 
 "Representative Susan Molinari, Republican of Staten Island, says the problem is one of communication, not compassion. 'The message that Joe Sixpack is hurting has gotten through to George Bush,' Ms. Molinari said.
" 'But the White House has got to figure out how to communicate the President's real concern. The mood of the people shifts rapidly and hits hard. We have to be willing to intercept it immediately. That's where we've lost our way.' "
Leave aside Ms. Molinari's characterization of the unemployed as lower forms of life, of beer-drinking Joes. What is striking is that she -- and the White House as well? -- defines the Republicans' task not as doing something for those damaged by the recession, but only of making them know that George Bush feels for them, whatever his lack of action to help them. That will make their Christmas cheerful and thankful.
At least the agendas that pander to the masses occasionally result in programs that do something, however poorly. Representative Molinari's attitude -- and that of the White House as well? -- shows absence of imagination about what a political agenda even is.

HEADLINE: U.N. Repeals Its '75 Resolution Equating Zionism With Racism

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 16

 BODY:
The United Nations General Assembly voted overwhelmingly today to revoke the bitterly contested statement it approved in 1975 that said "Zionism is a form of racism and racial discrimination."
 The official count found 111 nations in favor of repealing the statement and 25 nations, mostly Islamic and hard-line Communists, voting against. Thirteen nations abstained. Seventeen other countries, including Egypt, which recognizes Israel, and Kuwait and China, did not take part in the voting. [Roll-call, page A12.] 
For the United States, the heavy vote in favor of repeal was a demonstration of its diplomatic power. After President Bush called for the repeal in September in a speech to the General Assembly, United States embassies around the world were instructed to put maximum pressure to secure the repeal. The 111 votes recorded today were about 11 more than the United States mission to the United Nations had predicted last week.
 The vote reflected the shifting political currents of recent years, the Persian Gulf war in particular, which split the Arab and Islamic worlds, and the changes in the former Soviet bloc, fostered by the collapse of Communism.
 In 1975, in an effort to curry favor with the Arabs and embarrass the United States, Moscow took the lead in pushing through the statement on Zionism, which was one line in a longer resolution.
 With the end of Communism in Europe, countries there have by and large all re-established diplomatic relations with Israel in the last year. The Soviet Union and the rest of the former bloc, including newly independent Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, all voted for repeal today. The only Communist countries voting against repeal were Cuba, North Korea and Vietnam.
 
Asians and Africans Back Vote
 Many Asian and African nations, including India, Nigeria, Singapore and the Philippines, which voted for the Zionism resolution in 1975, reversed themselves today.
 The vote divided the Islamic and former nonaligned movements. While no Arab country voted for repeal, Bahrain, Egypt, Kuwait, Morocco, Oman and Tunisia all were absent from the vote. Algeria, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Syria, the United Arab Emirates and Yemen were among those voting against repeal. But there was no indication that those Arabs voting against repeal made much of an effort to persuade other states not to go along with the United States initiative.
 The one-line resolution repealing the Zionism statement declared that the Assembly "decides to revoke the determination contained in its resolution 3379 of 10 November 1975." It did not use the words "Zionism" or "racism" in the resolution.
 
Applause for Vote
 The 1975 statement referred to in the repeal decision said that after reviewing other international resolutions linking Zionism with South Africa's apartheid system, the General Assembly "determines that Zionism is a form of racism and racial discrimination."
Applause broke out in the General Assembly as the result flashed on the big electronic voting board high on one side of the hall. And delegates leapt up from their seats and rushed to congratulate Israel's Foreign Minister, David Levy, who led his country's delegation at the session.
 At a news conference later, Mr. Levy described the vote as "removing a terrible blot" and said the world community was "sobering up," with many countries "shifting their positions."
 A total of 85 countries, or just more than half of the 166 members in the United Nations, co-sponsored the repeal resolution, including the Soviet Union and all its former communist allies in Eastern Europe that voted the other way in 1975. The outcome was also at the high end of American expectations. On Friday, United States officials were predicting a maximum of just more than 100 votes for repeal but warning that there could be a 20 percent margin of error.
 
Enhancing the U.N.
 Both the United States and the spokesmen for the Arab countries voting against repeal saw the vote as important for both the credibility of the United Nations and for the Middle East peace talks. And their addresses drew loud applause from delegates.
 Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger, who led the American delegation at this afternoon's session, argued that repeal would bring the United Nations better into line with the realities of the post-cold-war world.
 Equating Zionism with racism, Mr. Eagleburger said, "demonstrated like nothing else before or since, to what extent the cold war had distorted the United Nation's vision of reality, marginalized its political utility and separated it from its original moral purpose."
 Repeal, he said, could "only help and not hinder efforts currently under way" to bring peace to the Middle East, removing a 16-year-old obstacle to the United Nations' playing a more significant role in the peace process.
 
The Arabs' Voice
 Speaking against repeal on behalf of the Arabs, Lebanon's representative, Khalil Makkawi, warned that it would hinder the peace process by whetting the appetite of "Israeli extremists wishing to pursue their policy of creeping annexation."
 It would also, he went on, "fuel the passions" of those Arabs "who believe the whole peace process is an exercise in futility which gives Israel more time to expand and achieve its revisionist Zionist project."
 But he said the Arab group "will revise its assumptions" if the sponsors of today's repeal motion can now persuade Israel to comply with the Security Council's demands that it cede occupied Arab lands in return for peace.
In a further sign of the discomfort that the repeal has caused the Islamic world, today's session was presided over by the United Nations representative from Honduras, Roberto Flores Bermudez, rather than by the world organization's president, Samir S. Shihabi of Saudi Arabia, who is of Palestinian origin and who was present for the morning session today.
 
Furor in September
In September he caused a stir by leaving the podium when Israel's Foreign Minister addressed the General Assembly.
 The 1975 resolution on Zionism was approved in a smaller General Assembly, with 72 countries voting in favor, 35 against and 32 abstaining. Three countries did not take part in the vote.
 Apart from the Soviet Union and its former East European allies, countries that switched their votes from support for that resolution to support for repeal included Brazil, India, Mexico, Nigeria and Yugoslavia.
 Those that have now voted twice in favor of equating Zionism and racism include Afghanistan, Pakistan, Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Algeria, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Iran and Iraq.
 In seeking support for repeal, the United States and its Western allies have used a variety of arguments to persuade wavering countries to join their camp, diplomats say, many of them based on a belief that today's vote would increase the pressure on Israel to compromise in the American-sponsored Middle East peace talks.
 All argued that Resolution 3379 was out of date because it was a product of the cold war, pushed forward by the old Soviet Union and embraced by a militant third-world nations that saw the United Nations as a forum for attacking capitalism and propounding a new economic order that would redistribute wealth from rich to poor.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 18, 1991, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about the repeal of a United Nations resolution equating Zionism with racism misstated the vote of the Philippines and Singapore when the resolution was adopted in 1975. Both countries abstained.

HEADLINE: California Plan to Cut Welfare May Prompt Others to Follow

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 17

 BODY:
All year it has been simmering: a movement to pay welfare mothers less and change their behavior through financial threats and rewards.
It came to a boil last week when Gov. Pete Wilson of California proposed to cut welfare grants by as much as 25 percent, tie teen-age mothers' grants to their school attendance and refuse extra money for additional children. 
 Governor Wilson, a Republican, pledged to put his plan, pointedly labeled the "Taxpayers Protection Act," before the voters in a referendum next November. Both of California's Senate seats will be up for grabs on the November ballot as well as the state's huge block of electoral college votes. By placing the welfare issue at political center stage at a time of public anger, California could prompt an anti-welfare movement as potent as the anti-tax rebellion it set off with the Proposition 13 tax-limiting referendum in 1978.
"This could be the Willie Horton issue of 1992," said Lawrence Mead, a political scientist at New York University, who argued that the attack on welfare reflected anger over all kinds of social ills, from teen-age pregnancy to drugs to crime.
"It's going to force all the Presidential candidates to address welfare and its related problems," Mr. Mead said.
By dint of California's size -- it has almost twice as many welfare recipients as any other state -- and its extraordinary political influence, its plan could unravel a decade of political consensus-building that had culminated in a 1988 law that is just now being carried out.
That law, the Family Support Act, sought a new compact with welfare recipients: it promised to give them more training, day care for their children and medical insurance, while imposing new requirements that they seek an education or a job.
Last week, aides to Governor Wilson appropriated the language of that movement, speaking of new "tools to achieve self-sufficiency." But most of what they offered was just less money.
Exchanging his usual professorial air for a mixture of glumness and anger, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the author of the Family Support Act, said there was "very much a consensus" among state and Federal welfare officials in writing the act. The New York Democrat promised to summon state welfare officials from across the country for an explanation about their planned cuts. "That's why I'm going to hold hearings and say, 'Why did you change your minds?' " he said.
 
Twin Pressures on States
 The Federal Government and the states share the costs of the welfare program, whose official title is Aid to Families With Dependent Children, with the Federal Government assuming a larger portion in poorer states. The economic slump has reduced states' revenues while swelling the number of people seeking services. Looking to trim expenses, 16 states have cut A.F.D.C. payments, tightened eligibility, or both. Six states have cut the general assistance grants, which go to single adults, and a seventh, Michigan, has virtually eliminated its general assistance program.
Some states also have proposals to change behavior, with programs dubbed Workfare, Learnfare and Wedfare. At least four states are considering, or imposing, penalties on parents whose children do not attend school. At least two want to withhold payments for new children and another has proposed cutting welfare payments if parents fail to pay their rent or get their children immunized.
All this comes as attacks on welfare played a prominent role in two Republican campaigns for governor, helping to elect Kirk Fordice in Mississippi and giving State Representative David Duke, the former neo-Nazi and grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, a majority of the white vote in his failed Louisiana bid.
 
The Motives
 The varied motives of this movement are difficult to disentangle since some analysts, looking at the proposals at their best, see a high-minded reassertion of old values and others, viewing the proposals at their worst, see simple racism.
Clearly, the immediate impetus is budgetary. California passed $7 billion in new taxes last year to help meet a $14.3 billion deficit, but already it is facing a shortfall that could reach $8 billion over the next year and a half.
In a speech announcing his plan, Governor Wilson said welfare costs were rising at a rate of almost 12 percent a year and attracting welfare recipients from other states. Without cutting $600 million from welfare, he said, the state would not have the money to keep students in college and criminals off the street.
"That's not fair to the working men and women of California," he said.
Beneath the budget numbers is an anger at a welfare system that has no defenders, only varying degrees of critics. David Ellwood, a professor of public policy at Harvard University, found that more than half the welfare recipients on the rolls at any time will spend more than 10 years there.
But it is not just Democrats who see the gathering of disturbing racial trends.
"I'm a centrist Republican, and to see the cuts so focused on A.F.D.C. is very scary," said Richard Nathan, the provost of the State University of New York at Albany and a former aide in the Nixon White House. "A lot of what they're trying to do involves a turnaround on civil rights and race."
Some proponents of Governor Wilson's proposals argue that the plan will help the poor.
"Cutting the welfare benefit will have a very positive effect on work effort and on the rate of marriage," said Robert Rector, an analyst with the Heritage Foundation, a research organization in Washington. Mr. Rector said he met with Governor Wilson earlier this year and urged the cuts.
 
The Predictions
 More striking, however, were the predictions from analysts like Charles Murray, whose book, "Losing Ground" (Basic Books, 1984), argued that social programs did more harm than good and might simply be abolished.
Mr. Murray said the California plan might deter some pregnancies, and, therefore, reduce future caseloads. But he said he doubted that cuts would push long-term welfare clients into the labor force, arguing that most lacked the needed education and discipline. "Changing work effort is tough," he said.
Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution, a research organization in Washington, agreed, arguing that the cuts would at most reduce the stay of short-term recipients who would leave anyway. "If we're thinking of the underclass mom, we're going to have to do something else," he said.
Others saw only increased misery. "I would not think you're going to change the behavior of a 4-year-old child by feeding it less," Senator Moynihan said.
California had already cut welfare benefits by 4.4 percent last year. Elsewhere, an analysis by Henry Freedman of the Center on Social Welfare Policy and the Law, a New York-based group, found that the District of Columbia cut benefits by 4.5 percent this year; Tennessee by 4 percent; Maryland by 7.1 percent; Michigan by 9.5 percent; Massachusetts by 4.3 percent; Illinois by 8.3 percent, and Vermont by 1 percent.
 
Incentive to Stay in School
 In addition, Mr. Freedman said, Kansas, Arizona, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Maine, Minnesota, New York, Washington, Virginia and California have tightened eligibility standards.
According to figures from the National Association of State Budget Officers, the average state spends 3.4 percent of its budget on welfare. In January, the median benefit for a family of three was $367 a month. In California, it is $663.
Governor Wilson would cut benefits by 10 percent and add an additional 15 percent cut for anyone failing to leave the rolls within six months.
His plan would give teen-age mothers an additional $50 a month to stay in school and take away $50 if they refused, require teen-age welfare recipients to live with their parents and deny extra money to women who have additional children while on welfare. The average welfare family has two children.
Wisconsin and Ohio are already trying similar school incentives, which they have called Learnfare.
 
Moves in New Jersey
 In New Jersey, Wayne Bryant, a leading Democrat in the Assembly, is pushing a plan that, like California, would deny extra benefits for additional children.
In Maryland, Gov. William Donald Schaefer, a Democrat, has proposed cutting benefits by 30 percent if parents fail to pay the rent, get their children immunized or keep them in school. In Kansas, the Legislature earlier this year rejected a proposal to pay welfare mothers a $500 bonus for using the contraceptive Norplant.
All such plans run risks of unintended consequences. For instance, Mr. Murray, the author, said that denying benefits for additional children could lead to increased abortions.
Critics call the current movement one of politics, not policy. Sheldon Danziger, a public policy professor at the University of Michigan, called the national anger over welfare "a reverse class anger."
"Instead of saying, 'Look at the huge amounts of money the rich made in the 1980s; can we get some of it back in taxes?' " he said, "it's, 'Let's squeeze a little bit of money out of the most impoverished group.' "

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Changes in Welfare Programs: What Some States Are Doing"
 
New Jersey
 A plan by Wayne Bryant, a Democratic leader in the Assembly, seeks to deny additional benefits for additional children. To encourage marriage it would also allow women to keep some of their benefits after marrying.
 
Maryland
 A proposal by Gov. William Donald Schaefer would cut welfare benefits 30 percent if a parent failed to get preventive health care, pay rent or keep children in school.
 
Kansas
Earlier this year, the Legislature rejected a proposal to offer $500 to welfare mothers who agreed to use the contraceptive Norplant.
 
California
 A proposal from Gov. Pete Wilson would immediately cut grants by 10 percent and add an additional 15 percent cut to those who stay on welfare for more than six months. It would deny extra benefits for extra children, require teen-age clients to continue living with their parents, give a $50 a month reward to teen-age parents for staying in school and impose a $50 a month penalty for dropping out, freeze the benefits of newcomers to the state at the level of their previous state and tie future benefits to the state's financial health by pegging them to tax revenues.
 
Wisconsin
 The state is reducing welfare grants to parents when they or their children fail to attend school, by up to $200 per child per month, Gov. Tommy Thompson is proposing a pilot project that would offer financial incentives to parents who marry and deny extra benefits for extra children. It would also require mothers who are minors to live with a parent or guardian.
 
Ohio
 The state is giving a bonus of $62 a month to teen-age parents on welfare if they stay in school and subtracts the same amount if they do not. (pg. D21)

HEADLINE: IN SHARP REVERSAL, WHITE HOUSE TELLS OF BLEAK ECONOMY

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 17

 BODY:
Executing an abrupt about-face in response to dismal polls and bad economic news, the White House today abandoned its effort to persuade voters that the economy was recovering and acknowledged that "for all practical purposes, the recession continues."
White House officials said the political reversal was driven by Samuel K. Skinner, President Bush's new chief of staff, who has moved quickly in his first two days on the job to forge a new public relations strategy intended to stop Mr. Bush's political slide as the 1992 Presidential campaign begins. 
 In an interview with a group of reporters, his first since starting his new job, Mr. Skinner also leveled some indirect criticism at the two men who had run the White House staff for nearly three years: his predecessor, John H. Sununu, and Richard G. Darman, the budget director.
 
'People Are Hurting'
 While the Administration has yet to produce a plan for economic recovery, Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, indicated that Mr. Bush had decided to stop listening to the conflicting advice from economists and his own advisers and acknowledge what economic indicators, opinion surveys, business executives, workers and Republican political strategists have been telling a reluctant White House for months.
Some advisers are urging the President to propose an income tax cut for the middle class of about $300 a family: good politics but probably bad economics. Others are telling him to ride out the recession: perhaps good economics but terrible politics. By acknowledging today that the country is still mired in economic misery, the White House seemed to be saying that Mr. Bush was inclined to act. [Page D21.]
"People are unemployed," Mr. Fitzwater said. "People are hurting. The economy is very slow. And you can get arguments from the economists, but certainly from any practical standpoint, the recession does continue."
He added, "The people of this country know that the economy is in trouble and it doesn't make any sense to play games."
 
A Far Different Tone
 Concerned that he not paint too gloomy a picture, Mr. Fitzwater later tried to leaven his comments by referring to "a recession kind of situation." But his remarks still represented a major shift for an Administration that had been contending for months that the economy was in a "sluggish" recovery, not in what is technically defined as a recession, and that if Americans would simply be more confident, things would improve.
"I am less interested in what the technical definition is," Mr. Bush said today in an interview with affiliates of ABC News. "People are hurting. When there's this kind of sluggishness and concern -- definitions -- heck with it. Let's get on with the business at hand."
White House aides acknowledge that producing an economic growth package is the President's main challenge. But Mr. Skinner, who began work on Monday and immediately orchestrated a week of events aimed at demonstrating Mr. Bush's concern about the economy, said he also intended to revamp the communications apparatus put in place by Mr. Sununu, who resigned under intense political pressure.
Mr. Skinner made no direct criticism of Mr. Sununu, but his words as he outlined his own management plans -- speaking repeatedly of his "inclusive approach" and the need to "let valued advice get to the President" -- seemed to cast a bad light on his predecessor, since that was his job as well.
Mr. Skinner suggested a less dominant role for Mr. Darman, who has had virtual control over the Administration's domestic policy. Suggesting that Mr. Darman is not necessarily speaking for the President when he testifies on Capitol Hill or negotiates in private with lawmakers, Mr. Skinner said, "Dick Darman is one of those people -- one of the people who will be up there seeking their advice and counsel."
 
'People Are Scared'
 For weeks, some Republican strategists and Administration officials, including Michael J. Boskin, Mr. Bush's chief economist, had been arguing that it was in the Administration's interest to give a more realistic picture of the economy. But Mr. Sununu had insisted on the more positive view and the White House clung to a strategy that sent Mr. Bush on a Thanksgiving weekend shopping trip to J. C. Penney's, where he bought some socks in what was supposed to be an inspiration for ordinary Americans to spend more.
"There's been an ongoing debate between a few people who thought the President could jawbone people into spending money and those who thought that's nonsense," said a senior Republican strategist. "With all due respect, people are scared. The President telling them it's a good time to buy a house doesn't change behavior, and spending 28 bucks on socks didn't start a stampede."
Mr. Fitzwater said his comments on the economy represented a conclusion that this sort of effort, along with the Administration's insistence that things were getting better by themselves, left the White House open to charges that it sounded "Pollyanna-ish" and contributed to public fears about the economy.
"All that does," said Eddie Mahe, a Republican strategist, "is leave a sense of one of two things: either the President's out of touch or he's lying, and neither is acceptable. I think this is a wise, wise, wise repositioning on his part, even if it increases the pressure both generically and specifically on them to do something."
 
A Communications Problem
 Talking with the reporters today, Mr. Skinner also said the White House had a "communications problem."
"It's pretty obvious to me, and I don't fault the media for this, we have not communicated somehow what he's been spending his time on, and what he's been doing has not become apparent," he said.
The White House was reeling today from new opinion polls showing Mr. Bush's approval ratings over all, and especially his handling of the economy, at an all-time low for his Administration. Fourth-quarter figures on the economy are expected to be disappointing and the chairman of the Federal Reserve has warned, in what Mr. Fitzwater called a "sobering" statement, that lower interest rates, on which Mr. Bush has been counting heavily to pump up the economy, will not accomplish that alone.
At the same time, a wide range of economists told the House Ways and Means Committee today that a quick tax cut would do more harm than good to the economy.
The Democrats, who have made attacks on Mr. Bush's inaction on the economy the centerpiece of their 1992 strategy, produced a news release today that listed quotations from Mr. Bush on the prospects for recovery next to similar quotations from President Herbert Hoover, whose legacy the Republicans have struggled for decades to shed.
In response to these pressures, Mr. Bush took part in several events this week intended to demonstrate that he is concerned about the economy and to meet the new challenge to his re-election in 1992.
The White House permitted reporters today to photograph Mr. Bush meeting with Mr. Darman and Mr. Boskin, a meeting that is normally closed. On Wednesday, Mr. Bush plans to fly to Texas, where he will sign a new transportation bill at a Texas highway project to make the point that the bill will create new jobs.

HEADLINE: SOVIET DISARRAY;
YELTSIN REBUFFED BY ASIAN REPUBLIC ON NUCLEAR ARMS

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALMA-ATA, Kazakhstan, Dec. 17

 BODY:
The President of this Central Asian republic made it clear today that in advance of negotiations with Russia and other republics on the details of the new commonwealth, he was not ready to cede any advantages to the larger, more powerful Russian republic.
Speaking to reporters accompanying Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d on a visit here, the President of Kazakhstan, Nursultan A. Nazarbayev, took issue with the comments made on Monday by the Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin, that eventually all Soviet republics would eliminate nuclear weapons except Russia. Mr. Nazarbayev declared today that Kazakhstan would retain its nuclear missiles as long as Russia did. 
 He and his spokesmen said that their republic would be prepared to put its nuclear missiles, together with those of Russia and other republics, under a unified command of the new commonwealth that would succeed the Soviet Union, but that Kazakhstan would not disarm unilaterally before Russia.
 
'We Will Keep Some'
 "If Russia keeps some nuclear weapons, we will keep some," said the spokesman, Seitcazy Mataev. Otherwise, "we want common control."
Kazakh officials also said they intended to seek a seat in the United Nations eventually and would not automatically go along with the idea that Russia would assume the Soviet seat on the Security Council -- as Mr. Yeltsin also suggested. Kazakh officials said this question would have to be discussed by the leadership of the new commonwealth, which might collectively fill the Council seat.
The leaders of the republics that have decided to join the new commonwealth are to convene on Saturday in this snowbound city nestled at the foot of the Tian Shan Mountains, near the border with China. President Nazarbayev told Mr. Baker that they would sign a new accord to replace the one agreed to nine days ago by Russia, Byelorussia and Ukraine.
The new arrangement is to be called the Commonwealth of Euro-Asian Independent States, they said.
While none of the apparent differences between Kazakhstan and Russia are insurmountable, they nevertheless gave Mr. Baker a firsthand taste of how difficult it might be for the new commonwealth to develop a coherent foreign policy. It also highlighted just how unfinished are some of the commonwealth's basic political and security arrangements.
Mr. Baker flew from Moscow this morning to visit Bishkek, formerly known as Frunze, the capital of Kirghizia, and then on to Kazakhstan. Both Central Asian republics are led by pro-American Presidents ready to adopt free-market economics. By going out of his way to visit them both, Mr. Baker was trying to signal all other republics that these are the sort of models they should follow.
President Nazarbayev told Mr. Baker that Armenia and the three original commonwealth members -- Russia, Ukraine and Byelorussia -- would join the five Central Asian republics at the meeting here on Saturday.
 
Equal Membership Demanded
 The Central Asian republics -- Kirghizia, Kazakhstan, Tadzhikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenia -- insist they will not join the commonwealth as second-class members, said Mr. Mataev, Mr. Nazarbayev's spokesman. They want the commonwealth to be recast with them as founding members. "We are going to join as full members with equal rights," said Mr. Mataev.
Therefore, he said, a new agreement will be signed on Saturday forming the Commonwealth of Euro-Asian Independent States, and at this meeting the fundamental questions, including long-term nuclear controls and the United Nations seat, will be sorted out.
On Monday, President Yeltsin said at a news conference with Mr. Baker in the Kremlin that he expected that the three republics besides Russia that have long-range nuclear missiles -- Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Byelorussia -- would agree to a system of joint control in the short run. In the long run, he said, the three will "eliminate" all of their nuclear missiles and leave Russia the sole nuclear power, succeeding the Soviet Union.
President Nazarbayev, in a news conference with Mr. Baker after their talks today, said he endorsed the idea of four-republic control but would not endorse the idea that Kazakhstan, which has roughly 100 intercontinental ballistic missiles, as well as the leading missile test site in the Soviet Union, eliminate its nuclear weapons while Russia remained a nuclear power.
American officials said today that it was their understanding that a defense council would be formed by the new commonwealth members, with Gen. Yevgeny I. Shaposhnikov, the current Defense Minister of the Soviet Union, as its head.
Mr. Baker declined to be drawn into the question of which republics would retain nuclear weapons, but he said that after his discussions with Mr. Nazarbayev, he was reassured that tight controls would be maintained. Mr. Baker has been presenting various American ideas of how nuclear missiles might best be kept in check during the period of transition. Asked whether he was urging the republics with nuclear weapons to change the targeting of their missiles so that they would no longer be pointed at the United States, Mr. Baker dodged the question, saying he did not want to go into detail about his suggestions.
 
Kazakhs Seek U.S. Recognition
 Mr. Baker said Kazakhstan, which formally declared its independence on Monday, had joined Ukraine and Russia in seeking American recognition. He said President Bush would consider this appeal after he saw how Kazakhstan handled the nuclear issue, as well as human rights questions, its adherence to outstanding treaty obligations and its assumption of responsibility for its share of the foreign debt of the former Soviet Union. The same principles will apply to the other republics, Mr. Baker said.
Mr. Nazarbayev, once one of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's closest supporters, left little doubt that he felt he was finished.
"I think President Gorbachev is a historic figure," he said, "and from the beginning to the very end I supported all of his efforts in the area of perestroika, and as far as I know no other leaders of any of the other republics have anything bad to say about Mr. Gorbachev. Whether he plays any role in the new commonwealth, that is strictly up to Mr. Gorbachev."
In Kirghizia, the Secretary of State's first stop today, Mr. Baker met with President Askar A. Akayev, who also indicated that he thought Mr. Gorbachev's days were numbered.

HEADLINE: SOVIET DISARRAY;
Soviets Say Arms Scuttling Will Take 10 Years

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 17

 BODY:
A top official of the Soviet nuclear-arms complex said today that destruction of Moscow's short-range weapons would cost $2 billion and take 10 years.
He also said that a pledged $400 million in American aid for that effort should be used to build one of two storage sites for materials from retired warheads and that that center should be under "joint control" with Washington. 
 The remarks appeared to be the most detailed exposition to date of how Moscow wants to use the American money. The official, Viktor N. Mikhailov, directs the defense programs of the Ministry of Atomic Power and Industry, which designs and makes Moscow's nuclear arms. He spoke today to a delegation of 14 American weapon experts here to discuss the technical aspects of warhead dismantlement.
"This is an urgent, urgent problem and requires urgent solutions," Mr. Mikhailov said, adding that the sooner the storage center is built, "the sooner the liquidation of weapons" can begin.
Sweeping arms cuts threaten to put Mr. Mikhailov out of business and he is now lobbying to keep his legions busy. The ministry's construction crews, he said with mock gravity, "are almost unemployed these days." In his presentation today, he argued that the whole $400 million should go to his workers and not those of the Defense Ministry.
 
Congress Allocated Funds
 Last month Congress allocated $400 million in emergency funds to help speed the storage and destruction of Soviet nuclear weapons after President Mikhail S. Gorbachev announced dramatic cuts in October. Scheduled for elimination are 15,000 short-range weapons like artillery shells, land mines, air-defense warheads and naval weapons.
An important problem for American officials is insuring that American money goes exclusively for dismantlement and not new weapons.
Today, Mr. Mikhailov said that none of the $400 million should be used for dismantlement centers since they in principle could also be used for weapon assembly.
"The American people must be assured that this money won't be turned" into new arms, he said.
He added that too many people thought the $400 million would solve all the dismantlement problems. "It's not so," he said.
It would buy one central storage center, he said, that should be built near existing sites for assembly and disassembly of nuclear arms. Another new storage center facility would also be needed, he said.
The American delegation here includes Federal weapons experts but is sponsored by two private groups, the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Federation of American Scientists. Both are private arms-control organizations that more than a year ago began exploring how to verify warhead dismantlement.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
North American Currency Links?

BYLINE: By Sylvia Nasar

 BODY:
SHOULD the United States, Mexico and Canada, follow Europe's lead and move toward a North American currency area as well as a freer regional trade zone?
The question is not on any official agendas. But the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and the Mexican central bank are quietly studying coordination to dampen swings in the peso-dollar rate. Some hard-pressed Canadian exporters are urging the Canadians to peg the Canadian dollar to the United States dollar. And the former Federal Reserve chairman, Paul A. Volcker, recently predicted that "in five years, you will find a fixed exchange rate among the peso, the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar." 
 Harvey Rosenblum, research director of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said: "You don't have to go all the way to a single currency to get some of the advantages. A tacit agreement to keep rates within a narrow band, absolutely fixed rates, or a single currency are all degrees of the same thing."
Since its economy is by far the biggest of the three, the United States would probably feel fewer effects of currency linkage than Mexico or Canada.
With steadier exchange rates, importers and exporters would face fewer problems, less uncertainty and lower business costs. Mr. Rosenblum compares bumpy exchange rates to pothole-strewn highways: "You can haul the goods, but it's a lot tougher."
Predictable exchange rates could also increase investor confidence, helping to broaden financial markets and bring in more investment -- particularly in Mexico where the perennial worry remains the risk of a sudden flight from the peso. "Economists always say that you can hedge," said Richard Cooper, an economist at the Kennedy School. "But you can't hedge an investment with a 10-year life."
Stable exchange rates could also help defuse a potential backlash against freer trade from business and unions by minimizing large swings in currencies.
Finally, linking currencies "puts pressure on high-inflation countries to mend their ways," said Robert Gay, an economist at Morgan Stanley. In Mexico, inflation has been running at 20 percent, multiples of the 3.5 percent in the United States.
The peso was, in fact, linked to the United States dollar during the 1950's and 60's -- "a remarkable period of growth and stability and open capital markets in Mexico," as Mr. Volcker put it.
Few economists would deny that these benefits may accrue. But many believe that the economic case for giving up floating rates and edging toward a North American currency area is much weaker than in Europe -- quite apart from the fact that the merest whisper of economic integration raises hackles in Canada and Mexico. The biggest drawback to monetary unions is the loss of sovereignty.
"Currency alignment means giving up your economic policy," said Jagdish Bhagwati, an economist at Columbia University. Defending a fixed exchange rate can mean adopting exactly the opposite monetary policy than the one that domestic conditions call for.
"The one market of Western Europe and that of North America are very different entities," said David Laidler, an economist at the C.D. Howe Institute, a Canadian think tank. "To put it simply, the one European market is part of a broader political union and the one North American market shows no signs of developing in such a direction."
And it's far too soon to predict how free-trade agreements will evolve. The free-trade area in the agreement between the United States and Canada will not be completed until 1999 and the agreement with Mexico is not a sure thing. Further, said Miguel Mancera, president of the Banco de Mexico, "Currency areas are not essential to free-trade zones' good performance nor are the benefits of such unions self-evident."
The potential cost saving from going, say, to a single currency are probably much smaller here than in Europe. There are only three currencies in North America, not 12; the United States and Mexico depend less on foreign trade, and, in any case, business can always be conducted in United States dollars. The existing system of floating rates has also worked much better in North America than in Europe. Flexible currencies have helped the region adjust relatively quickly to shocks -- a big surge or plunge in world oil prices.
In any case, there is no compelling evidence that trade liberalization requires fixed exchange rates. "Central bankers always want to fix things," said Sir Alan Walters, vice chairman of the AIG Trading Corporation and a former economic adviser to Margaret Thatcher. "It makes them feel more important." The lack of a currency union has not prevented Canada and the United States from trading more than any other two nations.
At an international economics meeting in August, several Mexican and Canadian economists made elaborate arguments against a North American monetary union.
"It may be politically suicidal, and economically premature to say anything else," Mr. Volcker commented at the meeting. "But I also have the feel that they doth protest too much."

HEADLINE: SOVIET DISARRAY;
In Moscow, Too, a Liberal Mayor Feels Besieged

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 17

 BODY:
Gavriil K. Popov, the liberal economist elected Mayor of Moscow last spring on a wave of democratic euphoria, is running into hard times. His city of nine million is short of food and money, its streets are filthy, its politics are in disarray, and his own popularity is sinking fast.
Now, on the eve of a dramatic increase in prices, something bound to further inflame the public mood, Mr. Popov has said he cannot take it anymore and has offered to resign -- again. But even his resignation threats are being shrugged off by a bitter electorate, which has found life under a democrat worse than under the now-departed Communists. 
 The deterioration of the economy, especially the long lines to buy food, are not generally attributed to Mr. Popov, who is well known as an advocate of radical reforms that have still not come to pass. But Muscovites do hold him responsible for squabbling that has paralyzed city politics, for widespread corruption, and for an overlapping bureaucracy that seems to have expanded rather than shrunk.
His critics accuse him of using the mayoralty to set himself up for the future. "The Mayor is one of the better-off people in Moscow," said Yuri A. Vingradov, a member of the Moscow City Council. "I don't think he has wasted his time."
Mr. Popov, a 53-year-old former professor who almost never wears a tie, has taken on extra functions -- like chairman of the Center for American-Russian Business, chairman of the Center for Baseball and Softball, and head of a still-nebulous international university.
Mr. Popov and his supporters say he is a victimized reformer whose way has been blocked from above and below. His plans to privatize apartments and small stores in Moscow, they say, have been snarled in a quarrel with the City Council and clouded by questions of whether the city can go ahead before the Russian republic adopts its own privatization plan.
 
Catalogue of Adversaries
 Last Sunday, in making his latest resignaton offer, Mr. Popov cited a lack of support by the Russian government, which has not approved his request that Moscow be given special status.
"I cannot work in conditions under which I am unable to carry out the obligations I made to the voters," he told Russian television news. In an interview tonight, he said the situation in Moscow -- where he says he is opposed by the old Communist apparatus, certain business circles and the "lumpen proletariat" -- is typical of other Russian cities.
Supporters concede that the Mayor has been unable to make much headway. "There is not a single serious problem to which the solution advanced by the Mayor's office was not blocked" by the City Council, Valery Vyzhutovich, a Moscow legislator, said in an article in the newspaper Izvestia.
But others see a flaw in Mr. Popov's argument, since he both complains that he needs more power and admits that he cannot manage the power he has.
Since taking office, Mr. Popov has created a system of nine Moscow prefectures, something intended to override the old Communist-dominated councils. The result, many complain, is an added layer of bureaucracy.
Yuri Sedykh-Bondarenko, deputy chairman of the City Council, or Mossoviet, assserted:
"If Gavriil Popov had not sat in City Hall for half a year and done nothing except reorganize administration, then the city would not be in the situation that it is. Now he sees the situation in the city, and that it is about to get more tense, so rather than take the responsibility, he puts it on Yeltsin and the Mossoviet."
Mr. Popov's threat to resign has gotten a cool reception from the chairman of the Russian Parliament. "We have done everything so that he could prove himself to be an innovator," said Ruslan Khasbulatov, as quoted by the independent news agency Interfax.
 
Problems Common to Liberals
 Mr. Vyzhutovich wrote that the Mayor's problems were typical of those of other democrats who have come to power in the last year.
"Having taken over the functions of power on a large scale, the democrats did not cope with management," he said. "To cope with it, one has to either refuse utopian attempts to manage everything, and give society a chance to regulate itself where possible, or cease to be democrats."
Even admirers concede that in the months since the August coup attempt failed, Mr. Popov has been a bit high-handed. He was the first to seize property belonging to the Communist Party, and in a particularly visible land grab took over a 32-floor tower on the banks of the Moscow River built by Comecon, the now-defunct Soviet-led trading bloc.
Mr. Popov's proposal was simple, his press secretary, Sergei Stupar, said. Since the city of Moscow had at one time parceled out the land for the project, a Mayor could simply offer to take it back and pay Comecon's former partners 100 million rubles. If the committee in charge of dissolving Comecon refused his idea, the Mayor's letter said, the city would simply take back the land and destroy the building.
Mr. Stupar said the panel has now accepted the offer, although he did not know when or how much would be paid for the building.
In the meantime, the Mayor's Department, a new layer of city government employing several hundred people, has occupied floors of the building. Most of the rest is available for lease, with prices for foreign companies starting at about $600 a square yard annually.

HEADLINE: J. Max Bond Sr., 89, an American Who Headed Liberian University

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE

 BODY:
J. Max Bond Sr., a retired American educator who was president of the University of Liberia in the early 1950's, died on Sunday at his home in Washington. He was 89 years old.
The cause of his death was not immediately clear, but he had been suffering from prostate cancer, said a granddaughter, Ruth M. Bond. 
 Dr. Bond was born in Nashville, Tenn., the son of a Congregational minister. He was graduated from what later became Roosevelt College in Chicago, earned a master's degree from the University of Pittsburgh and a Ph.D. in sociology and economics in 1934 from the University of Southern California. While studying for his doctorate he worked as a waiter, a playground director and a physical training instructor.
He was director of an interracial commission in Kentucky from 1928 to 1931, a personnel and training official of the Tennessee Valley Authority from 1934 to 1938, dean at Dillard University in New Orleans from 1938 to 1940 and an administrator at Tuskegee Institute in Alabama from 1940 to 1944.
 
Worked With Haitian Schools
 From 1944 to 1947 he represented the Inter-American Educational Foundation in Haiti and also directed a commission working with the Haitian school system to improve its instruction in health and other fields.
He was then director of the School of Education at Atlanta University for three years, and was in Monrovia, the Liberian capital, from 1950 to 1954.
Dr. Bond's son George Clement Bond, who is director of the Institute of African Studies at Columbia University and a professor of anthropology at its Teachers College, said that as president of the University of Liberia, his father strove to maintain equality between teachers and students who were of indigenous African origin on the one hand and those who were Liberians descended from slaves in the United States.
The son said that after leaving the post in Monrovia, Dr. Bond was an offficial of the United States Agency for International Development from 1955 until his retirement in 1966. He served as an adviser in education and oversaw educational programs and had tours of duty in Afghanistan, Tunisia, Sierra Leone and Malawi.
In retirement in Washington he was active in local community affairs, particularly in the Capitol Hill neighborhood, where he lived.
He is survived by his wife, the former Ruth Clement; three children, Jane Emma and J. Max Jr., both of Manhattan, and George Clement of Teaneck, N.J., and six grandchildren.
Julian Bond, the civil rights figure and former Georgia state legislator, is his nephew. Julian Bond is currently teaching at American University in Washington.

HEADLINE: Limerick Journal;
An Irish City Bounces Back, in the Spirit of 1691

BYLINE: By JAMES F. CLARITY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LIMERICK, Ireland

 BODY:
People living here in Ireland's third-largest city, along the banks of what James Joyce described as "the dark mutinous Shannon waves," have long been accustomed to hearing their town bad-mouthed by the rest of the country.
To the smart alecks of Cork and Dublin, Limerick is "Stab City," where no one is safe on the streets. It has been a place to ridicule whether or not one has been there or knows very much about it. There is even doubt that the eponymous poetic form really started here. 
 In some ways, Limerick's problems reflect Ireland's: its unemployment rate is at the national average of 20 percent; it is ruefully watching young people emigrate to the Dublin area, Britain or America.
But in recent years the 1,000-year-old town on the Shannon River in western Ireland has been working hard, with some success, to improve not only its image and the physical look of the place but also the quality of life of its 76,000 people.
 
Foreign Companies Arrive
 An urban renewal program has cleaned out slums, refurbished the city hall area and attracted foreign companies to a clean, landscaped industrial park, providing hundreds of new jobs. As it finishes a year of celebrating its history, the city is arguing the merits of a renovation of its main medieval castle to attract more tourism.
The Mayor, Jim Kemmy, a 55-year-old stonemason, said: "Limerick has no more crime than any other place. The tabloids named us Stab City. The tabloids go for short words."
Indeed, none of Ireland's 17 murders in 1990 were committed in Limerick, and officials say there is no statistical proof that the city is worse than other places.
Mr. Kemmy said he hoped new industry could bring Limerick back to the prosperity it knew in the time of Peter Tate, who started selling shirts to sailors on the riverbank in the 1850's and became the town's leading employer with a factory that produced uniforms for the British Army and both the Union and Confederate armies in the American Civil War.
Limerick's modest renaissance has been enhanced by the emergence of a native as one of the most powerful national politicians, Desmond O'Malley. He is the head of the Progressive Democratic Party, which provides six crucial parliamentary votes in the coalition Government of Prime Minister Charles J. Haughey.
"Look out at the Shannon at low tide," Mr. O'Malley said, sitting in the lobby of the Ryan Limerick Hotel on a recent afternoon. "It is one of the superb sights in Ireland. There is a waterfall. It is the crossing point that controls the river for 60 miles east and west."
Eight hundred years ago, Mr. O'Malley's ancestors settled issues of river control and economy with axes, pikes and catapults that lofted diseased animals into the enemy throng. Now, he says, the success of the city and the area depends largely on regional planning and financing and on the creation of the Shannon Development Corporation.
In the old days, the problem was invasions by the Vikings and later the Normans. Now the enemy is Dublin, whose business executives and politicians want to end a longstanding arrangement intended to bring money to the west, the requirement that planes from North America land at nearby Shannon airport, with its huge duty-free shopping area. Some here favor reasonable argument and painful negotiations with the capital; others would seem to prefer the catapult.
King John's Castle in the center of the city was begun in 1210, lay ignored in recent centuries until the authorities had it refurbished for tourism, and it became the center of another battle.
The new facade, a network of connected pipes, resembles the Pompidou Center in Paris, the huge modern art museum whose exterior is also a set of crossing pipes and tubes. Some people call the castle "The Thing."
"Visually, the outside was not a success," Mr. O'Malley said. But inside, he said, are excellent displays of three eras, in archeological layers, of Limerick life -- the ancient Celts, topped by the Vikings, topped by the Normans who built the castle.
This year, the city celebrated its prime moment in history 300 years ago when it withstood a monthlong siege by the forces of William of Orange, the Protestant usurper of the English crown held by his father-in-law, the Catholic James II. The pro-James Catholic forces surrendered, but not before they won the Treaty of Limerick, which promised them religious freedom.
Some 12,000 Catholic troops were allowed safe passage to the Continent, and became known in Irish history as the Wild Geese, keeping national hopes and military tradition alive in exile. In succeeding centuries, Limerick kept slipping in national esteem, gaining a reputation for political radicalism.
But what happened to Limerick in 1691, a defeat that produced a kind of victory, is not unlike what is happening here now.
And so the people who created the commemoration celebration dug into the poetic history of the limerick. It may be that some of the Wild Geese soldiers learned a five-line satiric poem form in France and brought it back home, where it was used by poets writing in Gaelic to zing their English masters. There once was a Wild Goose from France . . . .

DINKINS RESCINDS SALARY CUTS
After announcing with great fanfare last year that senior city officials would do their part to ease the city's fiscal problems by taking 5 percent pay cuts, Mayor Dinkins rescinded the cuts for himself and about 800 other officials who are paid more than $70,000 a year. The pay cut, which municipal union officials had denounced as a "public relations gimmick," has produced $3.5 million in savings over 14 months, the city said. The budget deficit for the 1992 fiscal year is estimated at $210 million. B3.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
'Baby Bells' Are Accused of Overcharging

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
The Consumer Federation of America, one of the nation's largest consumer groups, yesterday attacked the seven "Baby Bell" telephone companies for reportedly overcharging their customers by about $30 billion in the eight years since the January 1984 breakup of A.T.& T.
The Consumer Federation said the regional Bell holding companies had overcharged telephone ratepayers and had used the money to invest in lightly regulated businesses that have made little or no profit for the seven holding companies. The group said the money would have been better used to reduce customer bills. 
 The methodology underlying the Consumer Federation's charges is technical and arcane, and covers a wide variety of situations in 50 states. BellSouth, the largest Baby Bell, and the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, which represents state public service commissions, both declined to comment until they could study the group's charges and methodology.
Next month is the 10th anniversary of the Justice Department consent decree that led to the 1984 breakup of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company. The Consumer Federation's asccusations come when recent court decisions have freed the Baby Bells to provide information services, like stock quotations, over telephone lines, a service that had been banned by the 1984 accord.
The Baby Bells' lightly regulated ventures include $2 billion in investments by Bell Atlantic and Ameritech in the New Zealand telephone company, and U S West's ownership of $1.6 billion worth of office buildings whose value has dropped sharply because of the recession.
Along with the GTE Corporation, the Baby Bells provide the bulk of local telephone service in the country and encounter little or no competition in providing that service to business and residential customers. Their revenues exceeded $100 billion in 1990.
The Consumer Federation, which claims 50 million members and represents 240 consumer groups, says that lightly regulated emerging businesses like information services would be open to pricing abuse. The group, based in Washington, is arguing that Congress should reimpose the ban on information services until the Baby Bells no longer enjoy a monopoly on local service.
Mark N. Cooper, the Consumer Federation's director of research, said the Baby Bells had received about $12 billion in "excess returns" since 1985. The figure is based on the Consumer Federation's assumption that the Baby Bells, which were virtual monopolies before divestiture, should have continued to earn the same rate of return after divestiture.
By the federation's calculations, Mr. Cooper said, the Baby Bells earned a nearly 1 percent higher return on equity, an important financial index, than all American manufacturers as a group.
 
'Excess Depreciation'
 Another $18 billion of the $30 billion in reported overcharges, Mr. Cooper said, comes from what he called "excess depreciation," which covers how a telephone company accounts for plant and equipment on its books. Such accelerated depreciation is intended to encourage a company to replace its outdated plant and equipment, by accounting for the depreciation as a higher cost of doing business.
But Mr. Cooper argued that the Bells' depreciation practices simply meant that the companies could keep more of their customers' money, rather than reduce telephone bills.

HEADLINE: Plan for Razing On Ellis Island Prompts Protest

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY

 BODY:
A National Park Service proposal to demolish 12 buildings on Ellis Island, making way for the construction of an international conference center, drew sharply conflicting reactions at a hearing last night.
Proponents hailed the center, which would be privately built and owned, as a boost to the regional economy, while critics condemned the $145 million plan as a violation of the character of the island and the memory of millions of immigrants who passed through it. 
 Orin Lehman, New York State's historic preservation officer, appealed to the Park Service to abandon the project and instead stabilize and restore all 30 dilapidated buildings on the south half of the 25-acre island.
"Today's proposal is unnecessarily destructive of the physical and symbolic values which Ellis Island represents," Mr. Lehman said. "It tramples on the evocative nature of the island."
 
Destroy It to Save It?
 Another critic, Representative Ted Weiss, Democrat of Manhattan, also urged the Park Service to preserve all the buildings. "Must we destroy part of Ellis Island to save it?" he asked. "The partial destruction of a national shrine by an arm of Government should not be taken lightly."
But Representative Charles B. Rangel, another Democrat of Manhattan, argued in a statement read by an aide that the plan provided the "best, and perhaps only, hope for saving -- and using -- the greater proportion of historic buildings." Besides providing desperately needed jobs, Mr. Rangel's statement said, the center could be used for meetings of international, national, educational and scientific groups.
The Park Service approved the conference center idea in 1984. But until recently the service had insisted that the developer, William Hubbard, director of the Center for Housing Partnerships, a New York company that rehabilitates older buildings, create the center in existing structures without demolition. Mr. Hubbard was unable to raise financing for the project.
Last summer, a new partner, International Conference Resorts of America, offered financing if the 12 buildings were torn down.
Eighteen other buildings, most of them onetime hospital wards, would be rehabilitated to provide conference suites and hotel rooms. The new complex would include more hotel rooms and suites, a ballroom, banquet hall, restaurant and pool.
The 12 buildings that would be destroyed include a furnace room, laundry, crematory and five hospital wards.

HEADLINE: A Hardy Flu Bug and Long Lines for Shots

BYLINE: By ANDREW L. YARROW, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Conn., Dec. 17

 BODY:
Before Peter Gianokos rolled up his sleeve yesterday for a nurse to inject him with a dose of influenza vaccine, the 74-year-old Stamford resident had not had a flu shot since he was in the Navy during World War II.
"I heard it's more severe this winter, and I know a lot of people who've had the flu pretty bad," he said, explaining his decision to show up at one of about 45 flu clinics held during the last two months by the Stamford Health Department. "They advertised it so much, and since it's a good precaution and it's free, I'd be foolish not to take it." 
 Mr. Gianokos is among a record number of people in Stamford and many other communities in the Northeast who have deluged clinics in recent weeks seeking flu shots. Public-health officials say that the rush to get shots stems from fears about the severity and duration of this year's flu season, reports of a vaccine shortage and even the recession.
"We've seen flu earlier this year than we usually do, as well as levels of flu among schoolchildren that we generally don't see until the peak of the flu season, between January and March," said Dr. Louisa Chapman, a medical epidemiologist and expert on influenza at the Federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. "We don't know if it's just coming earlier this year or it's going to be a more long and drawn-out flu season."
 
Schools Closed
 In the agency's most recent weekly national survey, it found that 8 to 10 percent of doctor visits were for "flu-like symptoms," a percentage "typically associated with the season's peak," Dr. Chapman added.
Health officials throughout the region also say that this year's flu season has either peaked earlier or is threatening to be unusually severe. On Monday, 75 New Jersey schools reported absentee rates of at least 15 percent -- bringing to 138 the number of schools that have had such a high absentee rate since late November. Several schools have closed because of flu outbreaks, said Darlene Weiner, a spokeswoman for the New Jersey Health Department. In New York State, 18 of 62 upstate counties reported widespread flu last week, William Fagel, a State Health Department spokesman, said.
Flu-vaccine campaigns are usually directed toward the elderly, who are the most at risk for getting the disease and dying from it, but this year, health-care professionals say, many younger people are coming to doctors and clinics for shots. In addition, rising health-care costs and layoffs appear to be drawing a broader swath of the population to public clinics for free care.
"Getting sick is so expensive, and my doctor retired," said Marie Rebb, 78, explaining why she had come to the Stamford clinic, where requests for $5 donations were going largely unheeded.
 
$65 vs. Free
 "My doctor wanted $65 for the office visit and the shot, which I thought was pretty rude and outrageous," said Al Vaikutis, 38, who works for a courier service in Stamford. "I heard this was free, and these are my tax dollars."
Peggy Hone, a nurse at the Stamford clinic, said: "I've never seen this kind of tremendous turnout. There are a lot of people in their 20's, 30's and 40's with chronic health problems like high blood pressure who wouldn't have come in years past."
Influenza is unpredictable because strains of the virus change from year to year, but during a relatively mild year it strikes from 10 to 20 percent of the American population and kills 10,000 people, Dr. Chapman said. In three of the last 34 years, more than 40,000 Americans have died, she said, and during the worldwide epidemic of 1918-19, 20 million people died, including a half million Americans. Most of the deaths occur among people older than 65 or those who have chronic lung and heart conditions.
While many clinics and hospitals have run out of vaccine in recent weeks, the problem has been more one of distribution than of supply, Dr. Chapman said. The shortages have principally affected state and local health departments, which account for only about 15 percent of vaccine orders, she added. Several vaccine manufacturers are "redistributing from areas of excess to ones of shortage," she said, and clinics have been scrambling to obtain additional doses to meet the heavy demand.
 
Wanting to Stay Well
 The Stamford Health Department had planned to provide vaccine for 4,000 of the town's 108,000 residents this fall -- triple the number of doses administered four years ago. With hundreds of people lining up for shots the supply was exhausted by early December, Ms. Ormond said.
"We had a run on the vaccine about two weeks ago," said Dr. Andrew McBride, Stamford's health director. "We called other health departments and hospitals, but we had a difficult time getting more vaccine."
The town was eventually able to purchase several hundred additional doses from a manufacturer for about $6 each -- nearly double what it had paid for the first batch of doses it had ordered, he said.
Trying to explain the heavy demand, Jeanne Ormond, the director of the Stamford Health Activities Program for the Elderly, added: "With the economy the way it is, people -- old and young -- are hurting and stressed out and want to stay well."

HEADLINE: Those Lights in Big Cities Get Brighter, Census Finds

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 17

 BODY:
The Census Bureau reported today that three in four Americans -- 20 million more than a decade ago -- live in cities or the suburbs around them, more than ever before.
Final calculations have yet to be made on the urban-suburban-rural population breakdown from the 1990 census, but Larry Long, a Census Bureau demographer, estimated today that 23 percent to 24 percent of the nation's population lives in rural areas, slightly more than 25 percent in central cities and the remaining 50 percent in suburban communities. 
 The phenomenon of metropolitan areas lapping outward into old farm land, combined with an influx of immigrants into core urban areas like Los Angeles and New York, has made the United States the newest and largest member of the small international fraternity of nations whose populations are more than 75 percent urban.
The other nations in that fraternity fall into four categories: countries built around a single city, like Hong Kong or Singapore; small nations like Israel, Belgium and the Netherlands; mountainous countries with limited amounts of habitable land, like Iceland or New Zealand, and the two highly industrialized economic powerhouses, Germany and Japan.
 
The Definition Varies
 Carl Haub, a spokesman for the Population Reference Bureau, a private research organization in Washington, cautioned that the definition of "urbanized population" can vary from one country to another.
The Census Bureau defines an urban resident as one who lives in a central city or its satellite suburban communities if the core city has a population of at least 50,000 and the suburban community is economically linked either to that urban core or its suburbs.
Thus, a city like Brewster, N.Y., and nearby communities can be considered urban and a part of the New York metropolitan area if its population density is greater than 1,000 people per square mile and most of its work force commutes to Manhattan or close-in suburbs like White Plains.
The latest census report indicated that the rate of urbanization was growing fastest in the Western. Virtually all of California's population increase of six million in the last decade consists of people who moved into urban areas, and 93 percent of the state's population of 29.9 million now lives in urban areas.
 
Top 10 States Listed
 New York, which until 1960 was, with Rhode Island, one of the two most urban states in the nation, is now tied with Massachusetts for 10th place in its percentage of urban population (84.3 percent), after California, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Hawaii, Utah, Arizona, Nevada, Illinois and Florida.
Over all, the population of the West is now 86.3 percent urbanized, while the population of the Northeast is 78.9 percent urbanized and that of the Midwest is 71.7 percent urbanized. About 68.6 percent of the South's population lives in urban areas, the lowest percentage of any region in the country.
But Vermont remains the nation's most rural state, with 67.8 percent of its population of 563,000 living in rural areas.

HEADLINE: Bush's Time to Act;
Passive Approach on the Recession Collides With Harsh Political Reality

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 17

 BODY:
At one extreme, President Bush is being urged to propose a rebate in income taxes due April 15. This might be good politics, but it is probably bad economics.
At the other extreme, Mr. Bush is being counseled to sit tight and ride out the recession. This could be good economics, but it is terrible politics. 
 By acknowledging today what voters have perceived and Democrats have harped on for weeks -- that the country is still hip-deep in economic misery -- the White House seemed to be saying that the President was inclined for the first time in his Presidency to act rather than let the economy take care of itself.
George Bush did not cause the recession. And probably nothing he does will be primarily responsible for getting the economy back on its feet. But the American system does not permit Presidents to run successfully for re-election if they do nothing while businesses fail and workers lose their jobs. The last President who tried, as Democrats keep pointing out, was Herbert Hoover.
 
Little Chance of Passage
 The best bet is that Mr. Bush will come down somewhere between the two extremes and propose tax measures that will satisfy his political needs but do little damage if any to the budget deficit. If so, his solutions will be mostly cosmetic.
He must decide what to do before the end of the year, when he leaves for a two-week trip to the Far East and his staff begins preparing his State of the Union Message and the crucial chapters of his budget.
Whatever course the President takes, this much is certain: His economic package will not be enacted in full and maybe not even in part. Republicans are simply too small a minority in Congress, and Democrats have too much of a stake in putting their partisan stamp on economic recovery measures.
The best Mr. Bush can hope for is that the final product will be the result of negotiations between the White House and Democratic Congressional leaders. From the President's perspective, that would put the Democrats on board. He could still take political credit if the economic ship catches wind and begins to sail. If it sinks, he would not go down alone.
 
'An Untenable Position'
 The Democrats in Congress are under as much pressure as the President to get something enacted. They, like the President, are incumbents. "You can't run for re-election having done nothing," said a Washington economist who has been in and out of the Government for more than 20 years, "because your opponent will say you brought this all on and then didn't do anything about it. It's an untenable position."
"In this town," the economist added, "incumbency always trumps ideology."
The idea of a rebate in 1991 income taxes is being pushed mainly by Republicans in the House of Representatives who have never seen a tax cut they did not like. The problem, as with any tax cut that is not offset by spending cuts or tax increases elsewhere, is that it would show an almost total disregard of budget discipline and might spook the financial markets.
 
Fears for Interest Rates
 The rise in interest rates resulting from the markets' fear of inflation could offset whatever stimulus might be gained from consumers' spending their new-found wealth. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady told the Senate Finance Committee last week that one of the "guiding principles" of the Administration's policy was to do nothing that would raise interest rates.
On the other hand, in the position the President finds himself now, no politician can afford to sit on his hands and let the business cycle run its course.
That position might seem wise to economists who follow computer models more closely than election returns. In testimony today before the House Ways and Means Committee, prominent economists from across the political spectrum testified against an immediate cut in income taxes. The prevailing view was that any tax cut large enough to provide a quick kick to the economy would do serious long-term damage.
But with the Democrats almost uniformly backing one kind of tax cut or another for the middle class, silence by the President would allow his opponents to paint him as oblivious to the economic pain in the country. In its statements today, the White House went to lengths to demonstrate that Mr. Bush grasps the desperate shape some people are in.
So at the least, Mr. Bush will reintroduce his proposals for a capital gains tax cut and tax-free savings accounts. His advisers suggested he might offer some kind of tax credit for business investments in plants and machinery. And following the Democrats' lead, he will probably have to advance a tax break for middle-income taxpayers.
The big question is what the President will suggest to pay for this tax relief. Many Democrats want to raise the taxes of rich people, but the President's advisers say that is one step he will not take.
The President wants to be seen as acting decisively. But in frank moments, his advisers acknowledge that perception is more important than the reality.
 
Not Enough for a Movie
 Over a number of years, they say, a capital gains tax cut, an investment tax credit and incentives for savings would be good for the country. But they would have little effect, if any, on the immediate problem of a flagging economy. And a tax cut for the middle class of $300 a family, which is in the range being discussed, amounts to less than $6 a week for each family, not even enough for a good movie in most places.
For all the talk about their differences, there is precious little to choose from between the Republicans and Democrats on the matter of how to get out of the recession. In their debate on Sunday night, the Democratic Presidential candidates offered little in this regard.
Some suggested that taxing the rich more and the middle class less would induce more consumer spending, since the less affluent people are, the more likely they are to spend the money in their pockets. But economists, almost without exception, say the effect would be negligible. Redistributing the tax burden might be good social policy, but it would do little for the economy.
To make any real difference, a fiscal stimulus would probably have to exceed $50 billion, or about 1 percent of the nation's annual output. But the dominant view of economists is that a combination of tax cuts and spending increases that large when he budget deficit is already close to $400 billion would be irresponsible.
So however he tries to seize the political advantage next year in his budget and State of the Union Message, the President must mostly rely on the economy to cure itself. His Presidency may be riding on the outcome.

HEADLINE: Kerrey Concern Violates Laws On Child Labor

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 17

 BODY:
The Labor Department said today that on Friday it had assessed a $64,650 fine against a restaurant chain partly owned by Senator Bob Kerrey for violations of the child labor laws. The company, which is one-third owned by the Nebraska Senator, acknowledged the violations.
The Labor Department's regional office in Kansas City, Mo., said that in an unannounced sweep of businesses in four states, including Nebraska, it had found by far the most numerous violations at seven Grandmother's Inc. restaurants in Omaha and Lincoln that Mr. Kerrey, a candidate for the Democratic Presidential nomination, founded 19 years ago with his brother-in-law, Dean Rasmussen. 
 The department said it had found 116 young people working illegally long or late-night hours, or operating hazardous machinery illegally. The fine is more than 10 times the average assessed this year against companies found in violation of the child labor provisions of the Fair Labor Standard Act of 1938.
The citation of Grandmother's Inc. coincides with a pronounced decline in enforcement of the child labor laws from the record levels the Labor Department reached last year with several surprise inspections of businesses. Most were fast-food chains and retail stores, which make heavy use of teen-age workers who are paid the minimum wage of $4.25 an hour or slightly more.
But the number of teen-agers at Grandmother's Inc., amounting to 20 percent of the payroll, is also unusually high. Employers in Nebraska face greater temptation than most to resort to teen-age workers; the state's unemployment rate is only 2.2 percent, suggesting that employers have to dig deeper into the population for workers than most.
Senator Kerrey, who makes a point of his entrepreneurial experience in appealing for the support of business people, was campaigning in Texas today. He said: "I have been informed by my business partner that he has taken actions to correct possible violations of U.S. Department of Labor regulations. The restaurants are now in compliance."
He said that government regulations are the "most difficult" obstacle to starting a business but that be fully supported the child labor laws.
In an article last year, the Nation's Restaurant News called Mr. Kerrey "a loyal friend of the industry" and "an unequivocal proponent of free enterprise against government interference." It added that in the Senate Mr. Kerrey "is proving the fallacy of assuming that only Republicans can help free enterprise."
 
Assurance on Procedures

The Senator's campaign spokesman, Steve Jarding, said he doubted there was any political dimension to the Labor Department investigation. Steven Hofman, a spokesman for Labor Secretary Lynn Martin, said that on being informed Monday that a business partly owned by Mr. Kerrey would be cited Mrs. Martin sought assurance that normal investigatory procedures had been followed before allowing Grandmother's Inc. to be cited.
The Labor Department said the ownership of a business was not a consideration when inspectors conduct sweeps of the kind that ensnared Grandmother's Inc. along with 26 other businesses in Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri and Kansas. All the other businesses had fewer violations, it said. Mr. Rasmussen told The Washington Post, which reported the fine in today's editions, that he was "a very embarrassed businessman with egg all over his face."
Mr. Rasmussen, who is the husband of Senator Kerry's sister Jessie, runs the eight-store company of Grandmother's Skillet family-type restaurants and Don & Millie's hamburger and French-fry outlets. Mr. Jarding said Mr. Kerrey, who retains the title of chairman, owns 35 percent of the business, receives a $5,000-a-year director's fee and also receives an amount of the profits.
 
Too Late and too Long
 The Labor Department said most of the violations involved young people working too late or too long. With few exceptions, the law prohibits all paid work by children under the age of 14. For 14- and 15-year-olds, it allows three hours of work before or after school on school days, but not before 7 A.M. or after 7 P.M. On nonschool days, they can work up to 8 hours and up to 40 hours a week during vacations.
The law also prohibits young people from taking many jobs that can be hazardous. Those who are 16 and 17 are free to work whatever hours they wish, but they are excluded from certain jobs.
The Department said 112 of the 116 minors cited in the Grandmother's Inc. case were 14 and 15 year olds who were working too late at night or excessive hours. Among them, one 15-year-old was also working as a cook, the Labor Department said. The other four cases involved a 16-year-old and a 17-year-old operating meat-slicing machines and a 16-year-old and a 17-year-old operating baking machinery.
Last year, in response to growing evidence of widespread violations of the child labor laws, Mrs. Martin's predecessor, Elizabeth H. Dole, began four nationwide sweeps of businesses that tend to use teen-age workers. As a result, the number of youths found working in violation of the laws leaped to 39,790 in the fiscal year 1990 from 22,508 in 1989.
In the fiscal year 1991, which ended in September, enforcement showed signs of waning.

HEADLINE: Federal Panel Calls for National Standards and Tests for All Schoolchildren

BYLINE: By SUSAN CHIRA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 16

 BODY:
In a major departure for American education, a major advisory panel is calling for voluntary national curriculum standards and national tests for American schoolchildren.
Such standards would spell out, for the first time on a national level, what children should be expected to learn and what level of achievement is good enough at different stages, according to the National Council on Education Standards and Testing, an advisory group of major political and educational leaders whose approval is crucial to the success of any such effort. The council, created by Congress last June, concluded its deliberations today. Its final report will be made public in mid-January. 
 The council asked Congress to provide money for a successor group to put the recommendations into effect. But council members said the movement was bound to proceed anyway because President Bush made these ideas the cornerstone of his strategy to revive American schools. Several groups are already working to develop national standards in specific subjects and prototypes of national tests.
 
Concern and Opposition
 But because the panel was charged only to consider the broad outlines of national standards and tests, many crucial details are yet to be worked out, prompting concern and opposition from some educators. They worry that setting standards without providing schools the resources to help meet them will end up discriminating against poor children who attend inadequate schools.
Also, excessively detailed standards could create a national curriculum, stifling teacher creativity, denying parents a voice and causing political battles over what children should learn, the educators say. And they fear that without considerable money and commitment to devise sophisticated tests, national tests could end up resembling the same widely reviled standardized tests that American children take now.
Despite such fears, which have been expressed even among some of its members, the council concluded that standards and tests were essential to reach the education goals that the President and the nation's governors have set for the year 2000. These include making American children the best in the world in mathematics and science achievement and insuring that they demonstrate competency in five core subjects: English, mathematics, science, history and geography.
National standards in these subjects and national tests, the council's draft report said, will help in these ways: "First, they can help us extend educational opportunity to all Americans. Second, they can strengthen our democratic institutions and values while enabling all of our citizens to participate effectively in the political process. Third, they can enhance our economic competitiveness."
Although such standards and tests would be voluntary, the council recommended incentives for states and local school districts to adopt them, like tying Federal scholarships to test results, or penalties for schools that have high failure rates.
But such incentives or sanctions were not spelled out in the report, reflecting sharp disagreements between those council members who see consequences as the only way to enforce high standards and those who fear they might discriminate against poor or minority students who score badly because they attend inadequate schools.
In either case, the very existence of national standards and tests would represent a radical departure from a longstanding American tradition of local control, which has led to a patchwork of curriculum requirements and tests. "It was a fairly historic session," Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado, the council's co-chairman, said of its work. The other co-chairman is Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr. of South Carolina.
 
Some Ways to Set National Standards
 Governor Romer emphasized that setting national standards did not mean imposing a national curriculum. Instead, the council called for broad descriptions of core knowledge and skills -- saying, for example, that all children should learn certain principles of algebra and be able to use tables and graphs. In addition to such content standards, the council called for performance standards, or how to decide what achievement is good enough at certain stages.
The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics has already drawn up nationwide mathematics standards. The National Academy of Sciences, with the help of other groups, is working on science standards. The National Endowment for the Humanities today announced a $1.6 million grant to develop history standards. And California has drawn up curriculum outlines in several subjects.
The council proposed that its successor body examine such efforts and certify those that meet what they called "world-class standards." But many politically explosive issues remain unresolved.
While it is relatively easy in science and math to agree on what principles children should know, efforts in New York and California to do so in history and English have produced bruising battles. California's history guidelines and the textbooks based on them, while widely praised by many educators, have been bitterly fought by several ethnic groups who believe that their histories had been improperly told.
"Who sets these standards for schools and students, and by what right?" asked Theodore R. Sizer, an education expert at Brown University who heads the Coalition of Essential Schools, a network of nearly 200 schools working to improve academic performance. "Education is infused with values -- what texts will I choose? How do I teach evolution? I as the parent want to look into the eyes of people capable of changing that decision."
Reflecting the fears of many in the council that students in poor schools would be unfairly penalized, the council recommended setting standards to evaluate whether schools have enough money and equipment to help students meet high standards. But the council did not call for such standards to be nationwide, leaving open the possibility that states would still vary widely in the quality of their schools and how much money they give them.
"The council shares the concerns of those who fear that without other substantive reforms higher standards and richer assessments would be a cruel hoax," the draft report said.
This was one of the most divisive issues on the council, and even on the last day of deliberations tensions were evident.
 
National Tests: Can They Be Fair?
 There was even less agreement on exactly what a national system of tests should be. The council's 32 members agreed that such tests should be tied to the national standards and should check whether students were in fact achieving them. Tests would tell parents whether their children were doing well enough and how they compared with other students across the country.
They would also show whether teachers and schools were doing an adequate job. The council said schools and students should be rated on the basis of how much their test results improved to avoid favoring wealthy schools teaching privileged children.
Council members also agreed that the national tests should include portfolios of students' work and "performance-based assessments," which test students' analytical and problem-solving skills.
But the draft report was fuzzy on other details. The council agreed there should not be one national test, so that states together or separately could devise their own. It was unclear how results on different tests could be compared, although several testing groups are working on these technical issues.
The council did not estimate any cost for developing these tests, although most experts believe that they would be several times more expensive than conventional multiple choice tests.
Even more than the debate about standards, some council members and outside educators worry whether tests will be fair. Linda Darling-Hammond, a professor of education at Columbia University's Teachers College, said previous efforts had failed for lack of money or had ended up excluding children who scored low.
"How would we insure that this test would be any better?" she asked. "We will end up punishing the kids, schools and teachers least well-funded and least well-served. We will certify the inequality that exists in this country. There is no companion plan to equalize educational resources."
The draft report echoes many of these concerns and suggests that the council's successor body could help set standards to make sure tests were being used fairly. "The council recognizes concerns about poor, minority and disabled students who have not been well served by testing in the past," the draft report said.
 
How the Changes Would Take Effect
 But debate continued even today over what stakes should be tied to test results. Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of Teachers, said, "There is no evidence that telling people they are doing badly will do anything if there are no consequences."
Governor Romer replied, "We need to handle fairness before a number of people will buy into this."
The successor group the council envisions would be evenly divided among educators, state and local officials and the general public. It would issue a kind of "Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval" on standards and tests, subject to the approval of the National Education Goals Panel, created to oversee progress toward meeting the national education goals.
The council asked Congress to appropriate money for the successor body, and since the council includes four members of Congress, Governor Romer said he was optimistic. The four lawmakers are Senators Jeff Bingaman, Democrat of New Mexico, and Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, and Representatives Bill Goodling, Republican of Pennsylvania, and Dale E. Kildee, Democrat of Michigan.
The council also includes the leaders of the two national teachers' unions, Mr. Shanker of the American Federation of Teachers and Keith Geiger of the National Education Association, as well as school superintendents, educators, state legislators, Bush Administration officials and a business executive, Roger D. Semerad, a senior vice president of the RJR Nabisco Holdings Corporation.
The council ended by approving the principles in the draft report, subject to several wording changes. The final report will go to Congress, Education Secretary Lamar Alexander and the National Education Goals Panel.
Chart: "Measuring Student's Progress: A Call for National Standards"
 New "performance standards" for American schoolchildren urged by the National Council on Education Standards and Testing would spell out what achievement levels children should reach at different stages of their education. This ia an example of standards for science.
 
Knows everyday science facts
 Students know some general scientific facts of the type that could be learned from everyday experinces.
 They can read simple graphs, match the disctinguishing characteristics of animals, and predict the operation of familiar apparatuses that work according to mechanical principles.
 
Understands simple scientific principles
 Students are developing some understanding of simple scientific principles, particularly in the life sciences. For example, they exhibit some rudimentary knowledge of the structured function of plants and animals.
 
Applies basic scientific information
 Students can interpret data from simple tables and make inferences about the outcomes of experimental procedures.
 They exhibit knowlegde of the life science, including a familiarity with aspects of animal behavior and ecological relationships.
 
Analyzes scientific procedures and data
 Students can evaluate the appropriateness of the design of an experiment.
 They have more detailed scientific knowledge, and the skill to apply their knowlegde in interpreting information from text and graphs.
 These students also exhibit a growing understanding of principles from the physical sciences.
 
Integrates specialized scientific information
 Students can infer relationships and draw conclusions using detailed scientific knowledge from the physical sciences, particularly chemistry.
 They can also apply basic principles of genetics and interpret the social implications of research in this field.

HEADLINE: Trinidad Party in Comeback

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad, Dec. 17

 BODY:
Patrick Manning, a 45-year-old geologist, was elected Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago by a landslide in voting on Monday, and now faces the daunting task of finding the money to finance his campaign promises.
Mr. Manning led his People's National Movement to a comeback after five years in opposition and a past tainted with corruption scandals and allegations of incompetence and mismanagement. 
 His party won 21 of 36 seats in Parliament, inflicting a crushing defeat on Prime Minister A. N. R. Robinson's National Alliance for Reconstruction, which lost all but two of the 33 seats it had won in elections in 1986 that ended 30 years of uninterrupted rule by the People's National Movement.
The United National Congress of Basdeo Panday, a veteran left-of-center politician favored by the country's ethnic Indians, took 13 seats.
Even before the full results were known, political analysts began wondering where Mr. Manning would get the money to fulfill expectations his campaign raised among voters hurting from an economic austerity program that followed standard International Monetary Fund prescriptions.
Mr. Manning has promised to ease the hardships caused by the program.
Mr. Robinson's Government cut back public spending, dismissed thousands of civil servants, reduced Government wages, introduced a 15 percent value-added tax, and privatized major state-owned companies.
Against the background of these widely detested measures, Black Muslim militants last year staged a violent attempt to topple the Government.
The rebels stormed Parliament and the headquarters of the state-run television and took Mr. Robinson, half his Cabinet and almost 50 other people hostage. When Mr. Robinson refused to resign, they shot him in the leg; the ordeal ended after six days and he has since recovered.
While the austerity program provoked anger against the Government here. it won praise from international economists and the United States.
"What happened here shows a classic dilemma shared by many third world governments," a diplomat here said. "By the time I.M.F.-style programs take effect, a disaffected electorate votes its authors out of office."

HEADLINE: U.S. Eases Spending Rules In Presidential Primaries

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 17

 BODY:
Newly adopted Federal regulations have greatly loosened restrictions on how much Presidential campaigns can spend in each state. The changes will allow candidates in the 1992 primary season to pump unusually large amounts of money into the early states.
The regulations, which took effect last month, are expected to end a 16-year tradition of political trickery in which candidates foiled the intent of Federal election laws by following an unwritten code of conduct: stretch the rules to pour as much money as possible into states with early contests. 
 The intent of the state limits, which were put in place with the first federally financed Presidential campaign in 1976, was to discourage campaigns from concentrating their money and resources into the largest states with the most votes.
"It was really the fear that the small states would be ignored in the process," said Frederick S. Eiland, a spokesman for the Federal Election Commission. "It's now gone in the other direction."
 
Dodging of Limits
 The drafters of the original regulations did not realize that the delegate-rich states were not always the most important politically. Rather than focus on the big states, most campaigns sought ways to channel as much as they could into Iowa and New Hampshire, which have among the lowest spending limits but hold the first two contests. The spending limits are tied to a state's voting-age population.
While the new rules, drafted by the Federal Election Commission, do not abolish the limits, they essentially legitimize the practice of dodging them by exempting certain advertising, travel and consulting costs that had been considered part of a campaign's spending in a state.
The 1992 campaigns, for instance, will no longer have to resort to practices like renting cars in Nebraska for use in Iowa or putting up campaign workers in Vermont for the primary next door in New Hampshire -- all to keep down spending in a state.
"There's going to be a lot less funny business, monkey business or whatever you might want to call it with state caps," said Tim Raftis, the Presidential campaign manager for Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa. "Everything's going to be on the table in full sunshine for the public."
The change was something of a compromise for the election commission, which had repeatedly called on Congress to abolish the limits, calling them cumbersome, difficult to monitor and unnecessary, since candidates who take Federal money already must adhere to a spending ceiling.
With Congress unwilling to tamper with the campaign finance system, the election commission proposed the rules change, which its officials say will halve the time its auditors spend monitoring whether campaigns broke the limits.
"These multimillion-dollar campaigns have budgets probably three times as large as the Federal Election Commission," said Scott E. Thomas, a Democratic commissioner. "We were basically running out of resources to sort out all the minutiae that was required."
 
Rise in Limits
 The limits, which will be raised for next year, permit $872,539 to be spent in Iowa and $530,000 in New Hampshire, although those figures will be adjusted for 1992.
No one can say exactly how much more spending the new rules would permit, although some experts estimate they could as much as double the amounts now allowed. Others predict spending could go far higher.
 
Advantage for Cuomo
 Since the campaigns of the Democratic candidates are not nearly as flush as they were four years ago, the new rules could be of greatest benefit to a candidate like Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York who, if he decides to run, could amass large sums quickly to pour far more money into the early states than had been permitted.
"These campaigns in New Hampshire are strapped for resources," said George B. Burger, a Democratic political consultant. "But Cuomo could conceivably spend three or four million dollars there. It gives a candidate like Cuomo a tremendous advantage." The same could be said for other candidates who catch on and find they could raise large sums quickly.
Yet some strategists argue that the new rules may not greatly affect spending patterns, since many campaigns always maneuvered around the limits anyway. The election Commission is still auditing the 1988 Presidential campaigns but has already concluded that seven of them broke the limits in Iowa or New Hampshire. Although the case is still in dispute, Senator Paul Simon, Democrat of Illinois, was found to have surpassed the Iowa limit by more than $900,000.
Another reason the rules change may not have as far-reaching an effect in 1992 is because most Democratic campaigns started late, and their fund raising has been hampered by the sluggish economy. Moreover, since Mr. Harkin is the favorite son in Iowa, many campaigns have decided not to wage strong efforts there.
But it is also true that not all campaigns dodged the spending caps, so some may be more inclined to spend more this time if they know they would not be bending the rules.
This much is also clear: campaigns and their lawyers no longer must devote much of their time finding ways to exploit loopholes in state-by-state spending. And the new rules will also eliminate the spending limits as a political issue: it is less likely that Presidential candidates will point the finger at one another for busting spending caps.
"This relieves some of the candidates' anxiety about the pressure of the limits," said Robert F. Bauer, a lawyer who advises Democratic candidates on election laws, "and some of the difficulty of the commission in trying to enforce them."
While the new regulations do not abolish the state caps, they offer campaigns several exemptions so they do not have to count all their spending against the limit.
 
Exemptions to Limits
 Among the expenditures campaigns can make that no longer have to apply to the state limits are these:
*Half of all advertising costs. Fees for placing television, radio or print advertisements would not apply to the state limits at all.
*Travel and expenses of the candidate and staff members.
*Staff salaries in the state.
*Fees for consultants in a state who are advising on national campaign strategy.
The new regulations also abolish the "five-day rule," which in effect kept candidates and their workers from spending money within a state for more than four consecutive days. If they did, their travel expenses within the state would count against the state cap.
Major expenses that will still count against the state limits include half of advertising fees within the state, statewide polling and telephone drives and overhead expenses for offices.
 
Uncertainty on Amounts
 Donald J. Simon, a lawyer who advises Democratic candidates, said: "The commission has, in effect, raised the state limits. People always spent what they wanted to spend and dealt with the commission after the election. There should be less of that this year."
Officials at the election commission and officials from Presidential campaigns said they had no idea exactly how much more spending would now be permitted.
"It's like trying to put smoke in a bag," said John W. McGarry, a Democrat who heads the commission. "I don't think there is a scientific answer or even a way to analyze that." He said the change was important, though, because "the state-by-state regulations were generating a massive disrespect for the law and for the commission. It was abominable."
While she favored revising the rules, another commissioner, Joan D. Aikens, said she was still concerned that the rules change might go too far in violating the spirit of the law. "Everybody wants to make it easier for the candidates to comply with the limits, so they don't have to jump through hoops," said Ms. Aikens, a Republican. "But I wanted us to be careful that we just don't blow them away."
Mr. Bauer said new rules or old rules, most campaigns were still going to go about their spending the way they always have. "Spending," he said, "will still be a product of panic and bad planning."

HEADLINE: Scaling Back Growth at Harvard's Kennedy School

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Dec. 12

 BODY:
The John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, which takes pride in advising governments how to run better, is being overhauled itself after more than a decade of spectacular growth.
The task is delicate because the Kennedy School was the most cherished legacy of Derek C. Bok, Harvard's president for 20 years until he retired last June. Mr. Bok wanted it to create "a new profession" of public service, and he had sought to make it the equal of Harvard's gradudate schools of law, medicine and business. 
 But Mr. Bok's successor, Neil Rudenstine, in one of his first acts as president, appointed a new dean of the Kennedy School last month, Albert Carnesale, and charged him with restructuring the institution.
Foremost among Mr. Carnesale's tasks will be to end the school's madcap expansion, consolidate some of the school's myriad programs and find a new balance between its two often-quarrelsome factions. These two camps, whose rivalry often seems to leave the Kennedy School with an identity crisis, are the traditional scholars and the "practitioners," or former government officials and journalists, who have been brought in to teach about what is deemed the real world.
 
'Different Point in History'
 "Clearly the school is just at a different point in its history than it was 10 years ago," Mr. Rudenstine said. "There has been this tremendous growth that was wonderful, exciting and important. But it is perfectly clear that trajectory cannot be continued."
Instead, Mr. Rudenstine said, the Kennedy School "needs to be more selective, to have a sharpened vision and to make some tough choices."
One pressing reason for the shift is that while the Kennedy School's endowment has soared to $132 million from only $20 million in 1978, when it moved into its handsome new brick headquarters beside the Charles River, the institution is running a deficit. During that time its faculty climbed to 100 from 20 and its full-time graduate students increased to 700 from 200.
Mr. Carnesale, who had served for 10 years as the school's academic dean, insisted in a recent interview that he would not retreat from the grand vision outlined by Mr. Bok.
But at the same time he said the Kennedy School no longer believed it was "establishing a new profession," as Mr. Bok had called for, and that, unlike 10 year ago, the Kennedy School did not now "think of itself as analogous to the law school or the medical school."
"We are trying to improve the quality of public service, not establish a new profession," he said.
 
Leader for 3-Ring Circus
 By all accounts, Mr. Carnesale, an affable 55-year-old expert on nuclear arms control, was a popular choice to be the school's leader.
"He's what this three-ring circus needs, a good manager," said Dorothy Zinberg, a lecturer in public policy.
But there is already concern among some of the school's practitioners that Mr. Carnesale will try to answer criticism that the Kennedy School has more glitz than substance by imposing traditional scholarly requirements on them.
The critical issue is what Mr. Carnesale will decide to do about some of the practitioners who have long been out of government or journalism but who have not published scholarly books, as regular academics would be expected to do to win tenure at Harvard. These teachers, who work under limited contracts, are given the title of lecturer in public policy, not professor, and have no job security.
Some of these lecturers, like Robert B. Reich, the lawyer and economist whose most recent book is "The Work of Nations" (Knopf, 1991), are among the Kennedy School's most popular teachers and best known faculty members.
Mr. Carnesale must also cope with a budget deficit that Mr. Rudenstine said surprised him when he took over as Harvard's president last summer. The school's financial troubles stem from the era of expansion, when the then dean, Graham Allison, described by colleagues as a virtual genius at fund-raising, brought in vast quantities of money for new research centers and faculty chairs but not enough for operating expenses.
One school official said the Kennedy School got less of its income from its endowment than other parts of Harvard, only about 15 percent. Mr. Carnesale said the deficit last year was $300,000 on a budget of $42 million. The recession has also caused a sharp increase in requests for financial aid, he said.
Mr. Carnesale said he planned some consolidation of the school's curriculum and eight largely autonomous research centers. In line with a program for all of Harvard initiated by Mr. Rudenstine, he said the Kennedy School would concentrate on health-care issues, education policy and environmental questions. The school awards master's degrees in public policy and public administration.
The current retrenchment was actually begun two years ago by Mr. Bok when he appointed Robert Putnam, a respected political scientist, to succeed Mr. Allison, who remained on the faculty when he resigned as dean. Mr. Putnam said he was shocked to find "that we simply didn't know where we were financially." Last summer Mr. Putnam resigned unexpectedly, worn down, colleagues say, by his role as an accountant and by strong opposition from some of the practitioners who found him suspect because of his scholarly background.
The conflict between the two groups of faculty has continued under Mr. Carnesale, with each side expressing scorn for the other.
"It's impossible to have rigorous standards for practitioners," said one professor of economics, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified. "We only get the ones who are about to be out of office, and when they get here, they don't do research, which is half of the work."
Another frequent complaint by the scholars is that the practitioners were originally intended to stay for only a few years, bringing their fresh experience with them, and then return to new jobs in government or journalism. Instead, some of the former officials have stayed on at the Kennedy School for a decade or more.
On the other side, some practitioners believe that some scholars are simply jealous that they tend to appear more often on television or the Op-Ed pages of major newspapers. "You can never underestimate the power of envy," said a lecturer, who also spoke on the condition that his name not be used.
Mr. Carnesale insists that "the creative tensions in this school are inherent in the undertaking," since the Kennedy School was a professional school at an academic university. "The trick is to find the right balance between scholars and practitioners and to respect each other's contributions," he said.
But Mr. Carnesale acknowledged he believed that the Kennedy School now should "regularize" its guidelines on how long to keep practitioners and what standards to set for them. Last spring, in fact, Mr. Carnesale was chairman of a committee that recommended that practitioners be subject to the same eight-year deadline faced by scholars seeking tenure. At that time they would have to win a tenure-like appointment or move on.
Despite the bickering among the faculty, there is agreement among professors, administrators and students that the quality of the graduate students at the Kennedy School has sharply improved over the past decade, and now may rival those at Harvard's law and business schools. Still, a number of students say they would like to see more practitioners, not fewer.
"The school should balance its academically-bloated ranks with more professionals who have experience" in government, said Christopher Parker, who received a master's degree in public policy last June and now works as an analyst at the Office of Management and Budget in Washington. "I think the Kennedy School should be a training ground for professionals rather than a place where academic research dominates."
Lisa Duperier, a former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce in the Bush Administration who is in the mid-career graduate program, sees another weakness. "It wouldn't hurt to have one or two more conservative scholars on the faculty," she said. "A lot of Republicans don't know they can come to the Kennedy School, do research and receive high-quality professional support."

Bankruptcy Explanation By Maxwell

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Dec. 17

 BODY:
A main reason the board of the Maxwell Communication Corporation took the unusual step of seeking bankruptcy protection from creditors in the United States was to try to avoid a piecemeal selloff of its businesses by its bankers, the company's leaders said today.
This helps explain why bankers are furious that the heavily indebted British publishing company filed in New York for protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code on Monday night. The filing came after a meeting between Maxwell Communication and the eight-member steering committee of the banks on Monday afternoon. At that meeting, according to both sides, the company's executives did not mention the possibility that they might file for Chapter 11. 
 "We are absolutely livid," an official at one bank on the steering committee said today, echoing what other bankers also said in interviews. The bankers met all day today in an attempt to explore various options, which reportedly included legally challenging Maxwell Communication's right to file for bankruptcy protection in the United States as opposed to Britain. They apparently did not reach a final decision.
Maxwell Communication today applied to a British court to place the company in administration, which is the British equivalent of bankruptcy protection. At a news conference today, Peter Laister, the company's chairman, and David Shaffer, the managing director, stressed that the action in Britain was taken to support the Chapter 11 filing and make it more difficult for someone to legally challenge it.
In other words, the request that an administrator be appointed was not an alternative to Chapter 11. And if Maxwell Communication's board gets what it wants, a court-appointed administrator would wield relatively little power over the company. Administrators in Britain typically control the company in bankruptcy and have considerable freedom to close or sell businesses and make other important decisions. But in the case of a Maxwell Communication operating in Chapter 11, the administrator would apparently only be able to express his position to the company's board and management, which they could ignore.
 
Bankers Want to Choose
 One indication of how angry the bankers are is that they asked the British court to appoint an administrator of their choice -- someone from Price Waterhouse -- rather than the administrator from another accounting firm, Touche Ross & Company, which Maxwell Communication requested. The judge took the petitions under advisement and issued a stay on the request for administration until Friday.
As far as many of Maxwell Communication's 43 banks had been concerned, the issue before Monday night was not whether or not to sell off Maxwell Communication's businesses one by one in an attempt to repay its debts. The issue was whether they should liquidate the company now or wait perhaps two or three years when the economy in the United States improved and the businesses would fetch a higher price.
The company now estimates that its debts to banks and bondholders total somewhere from 1.3 billion to more than 1.4 billion ($2.37 billion to $2.55 billion) and Mr. Shaffer said the company's liabilities "probably exceed" the value of its assets.
About 80 percent of the assets od Maxwell Communication are in North America. Its main businesses, which are based in the United States, include Macmillan Inc. book publishers, Official Airline Guides and half of Macmillan/McGraw-Hill School Publishing. The company's leaders cited this fact as a justification for the Chapter 11 filing, although none of the subsidiaries were included in the bankruptcy filing.
Mr. Shaffer also said he feared that the confidence of creditors, customers, suppliers and employees of the operations in the United States would have been shaken if the company had sought only British administration. That would have weakened the company and decreased its chances for emerging from bankruptcy largely intact.
And Mr. Laister and Mr. Shaffer -- both of whom have been in their jobs only two weeks -- insisted that they thought that all creditors and stakeholders would fare better in the end if most of the company were retained.
"The objective of Chapter 11 is in fact to see some reconstruction and come out at the far end," Mr. Laister said. "The process of administration perhaps results in that less often."
According to Mr. Laister and Mr. Shaffer, the tone of the Monday afternoon meeting with the bank steering committee, led by Credit Lyonnais and the Barclays Bank, played a major role in the decision to file for Chapter 11 protection. For about two weeks, the company had been seeking an agreement that would extend through March the time by which the banks would not take action on loans that would force the company into bankruptcy or receivership.
The banks had granted only an informal standstill, and that expires on Friday, and "a number of banks" had not even been willing to commit themselves to that, Mr. Laister said.
Mr. Laister also confirmed today that the private Maxwell companies had owned about 80 percent of Maxwell Communication's shares, much higher than the 68 percent stake previously disclosed. Investigators believe that one reason the shares were purchased was to help support the price of the stock -- which collateralized loans to other Maxwell private companies.

HEADLINE: Hudson Valley Reels Under Impact of I.B.M. Cuts

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y., Dec. 13

 BODY:
I.B.M. isn't merely a prime mover of the economy here in Dutchess County. With some 20,000 workers -- 10 times as many as the next largest private employer -- I.B.M. is the economy. And now that the International Business Machines Corporation is pulling in its reins, each tug seems to spread anxiety across the soft hills of this rural county at the edge of the suburbs.
"Every family must have at least one member who works for I.B.M.," said Ellen Grogan, who counts two nephews, a brother-in-law and a future son-in-law there. "Rumors plague the area. People are scared. The security is gone -- the sense that I.B.M. will support us." 
 The frisson of fear reverberates across the Hudson Valley as the troubled computer giant continues to whittle its workforce. I.B.M. is the largest private employer in three counties: Dutchess, which is home to two big plants producing semiconductors and mainframe computers that account for 16 percent of all jobs in the county; Westchester, where I.B.M. has its world headquarters, and Ulster, home to a major manufacturing and development center.
 
Effects Felt All Over
 Most everyone, from county officials to I.B.M. employees, acknowledges that consolidation is necessary for the company to remain competitive. And they add that I.B.M.'s no-layoff policy has taken the sting out of the cutbacks, which are to be achieved primarily through early retirements and financial incentives. Yet the pangs of retrenchment are being widely felt: in housing and commercial real estate, in retail sales, in support for charities.
In Dutchess, I.B.M. has eliminated 4,000 jobs since 1983, when the workforce there peaked at 24,700. In Westchester, where I.B.M. accounts for 2 percent of all jobs, the number of employees has fallen by 3,000, from 15,000 in 1985 to 12,000. And in Ulster, the number of jobs fell from 7,000 in 1985 to 5,700 in 1990, for a loss of 1,300.
Those cutbacks happened before I.B.M. announced that it planned to cut 20,000 jobs worldwide this year out of a workforce of 350,000. Another announcement recently indicated that I.B.M. would try to match that number next year.
"They are talking about cutting 20,000 next year, and we could lose 600 to 1,000 people," said Constance S. Freid, director of the Westchester County Office of Economic Development. "That could have a severe impact on the county. These people have mortgages to pay and children to send to school. We count on them to boost our retail sales."
In all three counties, the fallout is similar. The housing market has suffered since I.B.M. -- whose initials, employees used to say, stood for "I've Been Moved" -- has slowed the practice of rotating staff through the New York region, as have other big companies.
 
Driving Force in Real Estate
 "In the past, all the major Westchester corporations -- Nynex, I.B.M., Texaco, Pepsico -- took their most promising field managers and brought them to the corporate headquarters for a couple of years," said Joseph F. Dzaluk, a former employee relations adviser in personnel at I.B.M. headquarters in Armonk and now the executive director of the Westchester Housing Forum, a nonprofit group encouraging the creation of affordable housing. "That provided a cushion of well-paid people buying homes in the $300,000 to $400,000 range," he said. "But those companies are not doing that as much today."
Dolores Y. Newberry of W. J. Lavery Real Estate in LaGrange, who is regional vice president for the lower Hudson region of the New York State Association of Realtors, agreed. "You could always count on a lot of people being transferred into Dutchess County by I.B.M., and that kept the market active for sellers and buyers," she said. "I.B.M. is not moving people like they did."
The commercial office market has also been hurt by the company's efforts to move employees from buildings it leases to buildings it owns.
In the last five or six years, real estate experts and builders in Dutchess County say, I.B.M. has vacated 500,000 square feet of office space.
"Years ago, builders would put up offices on speculation, knowing that I.B.M. would eventually rent it," said Lucille P. Pattison, the Dutchess County Executive. "When a landlord had vacant space, he didn't worry. But you can no longer count on I.B.M. as the tenant of Dutchess County."
In Westchester, a major landlord was forced to seek protection under Chapter 11 of Federal bankruptcy laws just before I.B.M. left a 212,000-square-foot building in Rye Brook in October. Two years ago, I.B.M. vacated a 400,000-square-foot building in downtown White Plains, and now the owner, who has filed for bankruptcy protection, is trying to stave off foreclosure.
 
Charities Affected
 The changes at I.B.M. are also hurting charities because donations are down, from individual I.B.M. employees -- since there are fewer of them -- and from the company. John J. Durkin, president of the United Way of Dutchess County, said that I.B.M.'s corporate donation has remained the same for the last three years, at $1.1 million. "Before, we were getting increases of 5, 8 and 10 percent a year."
"People are saying the good old days are over," Mr. Durkin said. "All through the 1970's and most of the 1980's, I.B.M. was extremely prosperous, and there was a mentality of prosperity here that people thought would reign forever."
I.B.M., however, says that it is not pulling the plug on the Hudson Valley, which stretches from Westchester County on the east side of the river north to Columbia and from Rockland County on the west side of the Hudson north to Ulster.
Jim Ruderman, a spokesman for I.B.M., said that this year the company expected a "small drop" in its Westchester workforce -- somewhere in the hundreds. "We're not going to be growing in the county," Mr. Ruderman said. "But we're also not planning to pull out of the county. We've been part of Westchester for quite a while, and we have some of our key operations there."
 
Commitment to Area
 Dutchess County should not expect any Draconian changes either, he said. "I see us being relatively stable there," Mr. Ruderman said. "The manufacturing work that we're doing in Dutchess is an integral part of our business."
I.B.M., in fact, recently invested $50 million in a state-of-the-art "clean room" for technological research in East Fishkill, where the company makes semiconductors.
Despite the thousands of positions cut from I.B.M.'s complexes in the Hudson Valley, unemployment rates there are still low, relative to the state and nation. While the jobless rate in New York State is 7 percent, Dutchess's is 4.8 percent and Westchester's and Ulster's are both 5.3 percent.
"The Hudson Valley was the No. 1 growth region of the state in the 1980's, and it's still holding up relatively well now," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, Regional Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics in New York City.
 
'Nothing Is Stable'
 "Anything that happens to I.B.M. is going to swing things and going to have major impacts, but so far the way it hurts most is that the Hudson Valley is not getting the growth they had in the 1980's," Mr. Ehrenhalt said. "It's a shift. The lesson of this period is that no community is immune. Now, nothing is stable. All the insulation has worn away."
Mrs. Pattison, the Dutchess County Executive, echoed that view. "I believe this is the first time in modern history that Dutchess has ever felt a recession," she said. "In the early 1980's, we didn't feel a pinch because of I.B.M.'s growth. We always felt invulnerable to the economic pressures on the rest of the country, but that's no longer true."
I.B.M.'s contraction should be a wake-up call, business leaders in Dutchess say. "The positive side is that it might push the county to approach economic diversification," said Jerry McDonald, president of the Dutchess County Economic Development Corporation, a private, non-profit organization whose goal is to attract new businesses.
In Ulster County, elected officials are trying to focus on the ultimate and, ideally, positive consequences of I.B.M.'s cuts: that the company will become stronger in the long run. "In some ways, when I.B.M. sneezes, everyone gets a cold," said Richard B. Mathews, the Republican chairman of the Ulster County Legislature. "We have to do more with less. But in the long run we hope that I.B.M. will still be a major presence here."

HEADLINE: Bank C.D. Yields Off Again

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH M. FOWLER

 BODY:
Yields on certificates of deposit and bank money market accounts continued to decline through the week that ends today, according to The Bank Rate Monitor, a publication based in North Palm Beach, Fla., that reports on interest rates.
"Because of more weak economic signals, such as a fall in housing starts, and with no inflation in the wind, look for the Federal Reserve to lower the disccount rate momentarily," Robert K. Heady, publisher of The Monitor, said yesterday. "That should trigger another decline in the banks' prime rate, especially since their cost of funds has fallen." 
 "It is a grim consumer earnings picture for an investor for at least six months or more because we have not yet seen the bottom of the numbers," Mr. Heady said.
The nationwide average yield on money market accounts dropped to 4.40 percent, off 7 basis points, and the six-month certificate yield declined 11 basis points, to 4.44 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of 1 percent.
The New York commercial banks averaged lower rates than those outside the area. On money market accounts, the yield averaged 4.11 percent, down 7 basis points since last week, and on the three-month certificates, the banks now offer 4.04 percent on average, down 12 basis points.
In the case of money market accounts, the largest cuts among New York commercial banks were made by Manufacturers Hanover and Chemical Banking, which each cut their yields 26 basis points. In addition, Manufacturers Hanover made the biggest cuts in three-month and six-month certificates lowering the yields by 41 points and 52 points, respectively.
At savings institutions in the New York area, yields for money market accounts were cut to an average 4.78 percent, down 5 basis points; for three-month certificates to an average of 4.72 percent, down 11 basis points, and for six-month certificates to an average of 4.90 percent, down 10 basis points.


GRAPHIC: Annual effective yields, in percent, on money market accounts, three-month certificates of deposit and six-month C.D.'s expected at selected institutions on Wednesday, Dec.18,1991. Some C.D. yields assume reinvestment after maturity. Yields are based on the method of compounding and the rate stated for the lowest minimum to open an account, but minimums may vary. Higher yields may be offered for larger deposits. C.D. figures are for fixed rates only.

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
The New York City Council held hearings yesterday on an anti-smoking bill that would require public service messages on billboards in subways and bus shelters to counter the seductive influence of cigarette advertisements on the young.
The measure would also outlaw smoking by anyone, adult or juvenile, in public schools during school hours and would require buyers of cigarettes to prove that they are older than 18 by showing a driver's license or state identification card. 
 The bill has the support of Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone and Mayor David N. Dinkins. Several legislators said they expected it to be passed in some form early next year, although there were many details to be ironed out, especially how the public service advertisements would be financed.
The most controversial provision of the bill, called the Tobacco Product Regulation Act, would require that for every three cigarette advertisements in buses, bus shelters, subways, telephone booths, baseball stadiums and other city-owned property similar space be provided for a free-of-charge anti-smoking advertisement. The bill does not say who would produce the advertisements.
The testimony at the hearing set the stage for an emotional battle over cigarette advertising in the city that will pit the interests of advertising and tobacco companies against those of anti-smoking groups.
On one side, proponents of the bill accused the tobacco industry yesterday of directing some advertisements at children, like the cartoonish Joe Camel series for Camel cigarettes. The supporters said children had a right to know the other side of the story.
"We should not be advertising poisons and things that promote death," Dr. Harold Freeman, a Harlem surgeon who is an adviser to President Bush on cancer, told the Council Health Committee. "This bill does at least give youth the opportunity to hear the truth."
But lobbyists for cigarette companies claimed the measure would run afoul of free speech protections under the United States Constitution. And business leaders said it was unclear who would end up picking up the tab for the public service messages during an economically difficult time when every advertising dollar counts.
 
Tobacco Institute View
 Adding to the complexities surrounding the bill, lawyers for the Dinkins administration also raised questions about whether the city had the legal authority to force the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to accept the public service advertisements. In addition, franchise agreements with the New York Yankees and the New York Mets may make it difficult to enforce such regulations at the two baseball stadiums, said Andrea Cohen, an assistant corporation counsel.
David Reemes, a Washington lawyer representing the Tobacco Institute, said the bill would amount to "a de facto ban on cigarette ads" because agents selling outdoor space would not want to subsidize the public service advertisements. He also said the industry would challenge the bill on free-speech grounds if it were passed.
Testifying in favor of the bill, a 52-year-old former model, Linda Sackman, told of losing her larynx and nearly her life to throat cancer after smoking for almost 33 years. Ms. Sackman began her career at 17 as the glamourous model in the Lucky Strike cigarette advertisements.
She said she wished every child who considered smoking could trade places with her for a moment. "That would teach them very quickly."

Chart: "Legislation: Clearing the Air"
 Age Limit: Everyone who buys or sells tobacco in the city would have to be at least 18 years old, and prove it with a driver's license, passport or state identification.
 Ban in School: Smoking would be banned in city schools during school hours.
 Advertising: One public health message about the hazards of smoking would be required for every three tobacco advertisements on subways, trains, buses, taxicabs, ferries, trams, bus shelters, city-owned property, or any property "to which a permit license or other authorization has been granted by the city of New York."
 Fines: $300 for a first violation of the law, $500 for the second violation and $1,000 for all later violations.

HEADLINE: Dow Rally Ends With A 16.77 Fall

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stocks took modest losses in heavy trading yesterday, with some traders seeing disappointment at the Federal Reserve's failure to move quickly to lower interest rates. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 16.77 points to close at 2,902.28.
After opening higher, then surrendering those gains, stocks moved lower in choppy trading, as investors waited to see if the Fed, after its Open Market Committee meeting, would make another rate cut. 
 But by late morning, the Fed indicated that it had not eased credit by draining reserves from the banking system, and investors, after a four-day rally, began backing off.
 
Broader Gauges Lower
 The New York Stock Exchange composite index slipped 0.87 point, to 211.21, as volume reached 191.7 million shares, up from 172.5 million on Monday. Declining issues easily outpaced gaining ones, 1,139 to 594.
Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks was down 1.72, to 382.74, while the American Stock Exchange index slipped 0.64, to 369.81. The Nasdaq index was down a sharp 4.03, to 539.70, while the Russell 2,000, which tracks smaller stocks, dropped 0.89, to 177.66.
Traders said the approaching expiration on Friday of options on individual stocks, indexes and futures contracts also limited the potential for yesterday's market to rise.
The release of weak housing-start numbers for November had little effect, traders said. But the absence of Fed intervention did hurt.
 
Union Carbide Off
 Elsewhere in the market, Union Carbide's intention to spin off its industrial gases business to shareholders, moved Standard & Poor's to change its rating to "negative," from "stable." The agency noted that all the publicly rated debt and commercial paper, which was guaranteed by Union Carbide's chemical and plastics unit, would be solely dependent on the chemical business. The stock fell 3/8 to finish at 19 1/4.
Tenneco also fell 3/8, to 29 1/8, as it said it would cut more than 6,000 jobs by the end of next year. The company said $50 million, beyond the $250 million previously announced, would be saved.
Traders said Shao Wang, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham, cut his earnings forecast for Digital Equipment and repeated his "hold" rating on the stock. They said he cited continued weak demand and other factors. The stock was off 1/2, to 56 1/2.
 
Paper Sector Down
 The ecoonomy's gloomy outlook was one reason Chad E. Brown, a Merrill Lynch analyst, lowered his earnings estimates and ratings on several paper companies. He said that in talking to industry officials, he was getting confirmation that white paper, coated paper and newsprint prices were continuing to weaken.
Among the companies he mentioned were International Paper, which fell 1 1/8, to 63 3/4; Georgia-Pacific, which lost 2 5/8, to 48 7/8, and Boise Cascade, which was off 1, to 18 3/4.

HEADLINE: 9 Towns Spare No Effort to Snare New Plant

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 17

 BODY:
At a time when most regions have been battered by the recession and many manufacturing industries are shrinking, the McDonnell Douglas Corporation is offering a potential economic bonanza to some lucky community: a new aircraft plant that could ultimately create 10,000 or more jobs.
But as it examines nine competing sites from Alabama to Arizona, McDonnell Douglas is looking for a lot in return. In addition to 600 acres adjacent to an airport, the company is seeking hundreds of millions of dollars in financial aid from state and local governments, including tax breaks and worker-training programs. The company also wants to avoid the heavy regulation and high costs of doing business in the current home of its jetliner business, California, which it has ruled out as a site for the new plant. 
 The selection is extremely important to McDonnell Douglas, the nation's largest military contractor and the second-largest builder of commercial jetliners, after Boeing. The company needs to build a highly efficient plant at the lowest possible cost to produce a new long-range jumbo jetliner, the MD-12, which it is counting on to help it survive intense worldwide competition.
 The process also suggests the rewards -- and the considerable risks -- for cities and states as they battle one another to attract businesses and give their economies a lift. The nine cities wooing McDonnell Douglas are Fort Worth; Houston; Kansas City, Mo.; Mesa, Ariz.; Mobile, Ala.; Salt Lake City; Shreveport, La.; Tulsa, Okla., and Belleville, Ill., which is just across the Mississippi River from St. Louis, where McDonnell Douglas is based.
Attracting businesses has become a serious enterprise for many states and cities and has taken on added importance as the economy has slumped. Indianapolis recently won a heated competition for a United Airlines maintenance center by offering the company nearly $300 million in state and local financial assistance in return for a pledge to create 6,300 jobs.
But public officials, academics and private consultants say city and state governments frequently fail to take a hard look at whether the economic payoff will justify their investment of taxpayer money. In some cases, these people say, it may be decades before governments will be able to calculate whether an employer has created enough jobs and generated sufficient additional tax revenue to offset the financial incentives they granted.
In other instances, the community has been a clear loser. In Yonkers, north of New York City, the Otis Elevator Company shut a plant in the mid-1980's just a few years after the city and the state invested $14 million to help build it.
McDonnell Douglas could possibly create a similar problem, some analysts said. The company has been losing market share in jetliners and suffering from the decline in Pentagon spending. It recently agreed to sell 40 percent of its commercial aircraft business to the Taiwan Aerospace Corporation for $2 billion.
"Cities and states have been burned before," said Virginia Mayer, the manager of economic development for the National League of Cities. "They have to think harder about whether it's worth it, given the fiscal stress they are going through."
Larry Ledebur, the director of the Center for Urban Studies at Wayne State University in Detroit, said that in many cases governments offered too much in incentives, not realizing that companies tend to make decisions primarily on criteria like access to markets, transportation and other costs.
"The first question you have to ask is whether it is necessary to give incentives to get the firm there," Professor Ledebur said. "But we are in a world where cities and states feel they have to offer a competitive incentive package."
 In McDonnell Douglas's case, each interested city has submitted a package of financial incentives to the company, which is expected to announce a decision early next year. The bids are sealed, but state and local officials said most or all of them appeared to offer incentives worth at least several hundred million dollars, primarily in the form of tax breaks, improvements to roads and other structures and worker-training programs.
The officials involved in putting together the incentive packages say they tried to tie the level of tax breaks and other support to the number of jobs created or other economic criteria. And there are signs of a reluctance to attract McDonnell Douglas at any cost: residents of Kansas City, for example, voted down a proposed $90 million property tax increase that would have helped to pay for improvements to the site McDonnell Douglas is considering.
"This is the biggest economic development package in this decade, and maybe in many decades," said Carl M. Koupal Jr., the director of Missouri's Department of Economic Development. "But there's some realization by all of us involved in these situations that you can't just roll in and start throwing money at these projects."
 
Fear of Bidding Wars
 Officials of the competing regions say they want to avoid bidding wars.
"If someone wants to give up the farm, I congratulate McDonnell Douglas on getting it, but they're not going to get it from us," said John Baricevic, chairman of the St. Clair County Board of Supervisors in Illinois, which is trying to bring the plant to the St. Louis area. "We've tried to be responsive to McDonnell Douglas's needs, but we have our other taxpayers to think about as well."
McDonnell Douglas originally announced that it would consider only four sites -- Kansas City, Salt Lake City, Shreveport and Tulsa -- then later said it would expand its search after being approached by the other localities.
In addition to evaluating the packages of financial incentives, McDonnell Douglas is assessing local wage rates, access to highways and rail lines, environmental regulations and the political support the company could expect.
 The attraction of the McDonnell Douglas plant is easy to see. The company estimates that it would need about 5,000 workers, many of them trained production workers making $15 an hour or more. Economists estimate that the plant would create another 5,000 jobs at everything from new restaurants nearby to suppliers that would be compelled to establish operations in the area.
Some estimates put the economic benefits much higher. One particularly rosy estimate was provided by the Mid-America Regional Council, a Kansas City research group that estimated that the plant would create 19,000 jobs and generate $505 million in additional after-tax income in the Kansas City area, based on what the researchers called a "conservative realistic scenario."
Likening financial incentives to an investment, the researchers calculated that the rate of return to Kansas City for a $500 million, 20-year package of incentives would be nearly 30 percent, using what they called extremely conservative assumptions.
 
Political Move in Utah
 The prospect of an economic jolt of that magnitude has communities eager to impress McDonnell Douglas with more than financial incentives.
In Utah, officials removed a potential political thorn from the company's side. The Republican-controlled State Legislature redrew the boundaries of a Congressional district in October to insure that Representative Wayne Owens, a Democrat who has clashed repeatedly in Washington with McDonnell Douglas over the need for one of its military aircraft, would no longer represent the area near the Salt Lake City airport where officials hope the company will build the factory.
"The Legislature was just making sure there wasn't a political reason to rule us out," said Russell G. Behrmann, a spokesman for the Utah Department of Community and Economic Development.
 Company executives have left no doubt that in selecting the site they are trying to avoid the kinds of troubles they have had in California.
Though based in St. Louis, the company has built its commercial jetliners in Long Beach, Calif., for decades. McDonnell Douglas says it cannot build the MD-12 in Long Beach because it does not have room at its site there.
But company executives have also made no secret of their displeasure with California's high labor costs, tight environmental regulations and what many executives say is a lack of support among the state's Congressional delegation. And the company is not considering alternative sites in California, including the Mojave Desert town of Palmdale, where there is plenty of land and a skilled work force that has helped to build aircraft like the Northrop Corporation's B-2 bomber.
 
Others Leave California
 California, in many ways, is the flip side of the rush among many states to attract manufacturing jobs. McDonnell Douglas is just one of a number of aerospace companies that are beginning to move from the state.
In a study released last month, the California Business Roundtable, a research and lobbying group financed by corporations, found that nearly a quarter of the companies surveyed planned to relocate some or all of their operations out of California and that a similar number planned to pursue expansion plans elsewhere.
It is little surprise, then, that other localities are rushing to assure McDonnell Douglas that it will face few or none of the problems it has in California. Shreveport, like other cities, has been telling the company that because its region's air meets Federal standards, there are almost no regulations regarding air pollution. That would leave McDonnell Douglas free to come in and operate in a way California would not allow.

Chart: "Vying for a New Factory"
 Nine cities are conpeting for a new McDonnell Douglas plant. The company is based in St. Louis and has major aircraft operations in Long Beach, Calif.
 1. Salt Lake City: The company already has a commercial aircraft parts plant near the airport. The state recently redrew a Congressional districtboundary so the proposed site would not be represented by a Congressional critic of McDonnell Douglas.
 2. Mesa: The Arizona city is home to the McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Company and would be convenient for the commercial aircraft division's esecutives, who are based in Southern California.
 3. Forth Worth: The city's bid is backed by H. Ross Perot, who owns land that could be the plant site. The region has thousands of trained aerospace workers laid off from General Dynamics.
 4. Houston: The company has a plant in the area that does work for NASA's space station, but the city is considered a long shot.
 5. Kansas City: Voters in Missouri rejected a $90 million property-tax increase to pay for site improvements, but city and state governments say their proposal is competitive.
 6. Tulsa: The area is already an aerospace center, with more than 350 aerospace companies there, including a large McDonnell Douglas operation.
 7. Belleville: A trained pool of labor, including many workers laid off from McDonnell Douglas's military programs, live in this Illinois town east of St. Louis.
 8. Shreveport: Economically depressed Louisiana is pushing hard for the plant. Economic development officials have received 80,000 pieces of mail from residents in support of efforts to attract the company.
 9. Mobile: The Alabama city has an expanding aerospace industry and a port to bring in large aircraft parts. (pg. D6)

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
Fed Appoints Chief Of Currency Markets

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
William J. McDonough, a former vice chairman of the First Chicago Corporation, was named yesterday to direct the Federal Reserve's intervention operations in world currency markets.
The job puts him at one of the key pivots in the $600-billion-a-day foreign exchange market. 
 While a central bank like the Federal Reserve cannot determine the direction of the currency market, intervention by selling or buying dollars can often help slow or even stop a rally or a decline of the dollar. Intervention is also one of the key ways that the United States Government can send a distinct signal about its desire for the dollar and, indirectly, its feeling about other economic policy matters.
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York does the actual intervention, which Mr. McDonough will run. The intevention is approved by the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve. Mr. McDonough was named to two jobs yesterday, one as an executive vice president of the New York bank and the other as manager of foreign operations for the Federal Reserve System.
The Fed's last major period of intervention was from May to October 1989, when is sold a record $17.8 billion of dollars in six months and helped turn a dollar rally.
Mr. McDonough's appointment, which was announced by E. Gerald Corrigan, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, is unusual because he comes from outside the Reserve Bank or the Treasury and has not been a player in these circles. He succedes Sam Y. Cross, who came to the Fed with a Treasury background 10 years ago. Mr. Cross retired this month.
Although he has never been a foreign exchange trader himself, Mr. McDonough supervised the foreign exchange and other trading operations for years while he was at First Chicago and its bank, the First National Bank of Chicago. For at least six years, he said, he spent at least 30 hours a week in the trading room.
When he retired from the bank at age 55 in 1989, he had no intention of sitting on the sidelines. Since then he has been an adivser to the World Bank and chairman of an Illinois commission studying ways to attract and keep highly qualified workers in state and local government.
His outside interests are in tennis, foreign affairs and the opera. "I am a tenor who sings at parties, hopefully only when asked," he said. He and his wife, plan to live in Manhattan.

HEADLINE: Commerce Dept. Losing One More Top Official

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 17

 BODY:
Michael R. Darby, the Under Secretary of Commerce for Economic Affairs, announced his resignation today in the agency's latest high-level departure.
Mr. Darby, whose responsibilities included overseeing the 1990 Census, becomes the third of the Commerce Department's six under secretaries to take a new job this year. His announcement today that he would return to teaching to avoid losing a tenured faculty position coincides with speculation in Washington over who will replace Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher when he resigns to become chairman of President Bush's re-election campaign.
 
Work Done by Staff
 But the high turnover rate has had limited effect, because so much of the department's daily work is done by the staff. Mr. Mosbacher has concentrated this year on domestic political and economic policy making at the White House and on urging business leaders to export more, rather than on promoting the department's role in interagency decision making. The State and Defense Departments, for example, are increasingly influential in export control regulations. 
 Of the 10,000 employees at the Economics and Statistics Administration, which Mr. Darby heads, only a handful are political appointees.
No successor to Mr. Mosbacher is likely to be named until after he returns from a trip to Asia on Jan. 10 and resigns, probably the following week, to head up the Bush campaign.
Deputy Commerce Secretary Rockwell A. Schnabel will be the Acting Secretary during Mr. Mosbacher's absence and during the confirmation hearings of a successor. He is not expected to make any substantial changes.
 
To Depart Jan. 4
 Mr. Darby's departure, which is planned for Jan. 4, follows the resignation in May of Dennis Kloske, the Under Secretary for Export Administration, and the promotion of Mr. Schnabel from Under Secretary for Travel and Tourism.
Two widely mentioned candidates to succeed Mr. Mosbacher have been John B. Macomber, the chairman of the Export-Import Bank of the United States, and Bill Frenzel, a former Minnesota Republican who served for 16 years on the House Ways and Means Committee and focused on trade issues.
But one official familiar with the selection process said today that Mr. Macomber's name had already been ruled out, because the White House was interested in nominating someone who could help the Administration more in an election year, like a woman, a member of a minority or someone with strong political connections in a key state.
"It won't be him; they need the political mileage on this appointment," said the official, who asked not to be named.
Mr. Macomber, who the official said did not actively seek the position, comes from New York, which may prove important in next year's elections, but as a former management consultant and chemical company executive who has never held elective office, he has little voter recognition.
 
No Call, Frenzel Says
 Mr. Frenzel said today that while he would not rule out accepting the job if pressed to take it, he had not been contacted by the White House.
Mr. Darby, who is 46 years old, was told that if he did not return to his tenured position at the John E. Anderson School of Business at the University of California at Los Angeles by the beginning of the year he would lose it automatically, Carol A. Scott, the faculty chairman, said today.
Mr. Darby, who spent nearly three years as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Economic Affairs before moving to the Commerce Department in May 1989, has received several extensions to his original leave of absence.

HEADLINE: Bam! Pow! Margins! Sales Mix!

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
Will Marvel Entertainment Group's shareholder reports become collector's items?
Yesterday, the comic book publisher released its first quarterly report since Marvel became a public company in July. The report came out in the form of a four-page comic book, with Spider-Man and the Incredible Hulk, two of the company's comic characters, bragging to each other about just how wonderful a quarter it was. 
 But if the pictures were familiar to comic book readers, the words may have seemed a little on the formal side. "Gross margins increased due to the favorable sales mix of publications and higher licensing revenues," Incredible Hulk explains to Spider-Man at one point. "And interest expense declined due to lower interest rates and reduced indebtedness."
But if some comic fans find that kind of talk perplexing, they are likely to understand, though perhaps not appreciate, the Hulk's next comment: "And after the quarter ended, we announced a $0.25 retail price increase for most of our comic books in 1992."
The financial figures in the report had previously been released, showing that net income in the third quarter more than tripled, rising to $6.7 million, or 55 cents a share, from $2.1 million, or 18 cents a share. Revenues were up 59 percent, to $38.3 million.
The results, together with expectations that comic book fans will willingly pay the higher prices, have helped raise Marvel's share price from $16.50 when it went public in July, to $42.75 yesterday, down 62.5 cents for the day in New York Stock Exchange trading.

HEADLINE: Housing Starts Dropped 2.1% in November

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 17

 BODY:
Housing starts fell 2.1 percent in November, all but assuring home builders of their worst year since the end of World War II, the Commerce Department reported today. The report apparently contributed to a White House decision to acknowledge that the economy remained in recession.
The housing industry traditionally leads the economy out of recession, but after a spurt earlier this year it has slumped along with the rest of the economy despite continuing declines in interest rates. 
 Mirroring the suggestions of many analysts, the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said, "For all practical purposes, the recession continues."
The Bush Administration and many private economists have urged the Federal Reserve to cut short-term interest rates to help revive the faltering economy.
The Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's policy-making arm, met privately today amid expectations of a further easing of credit, perhaps as early as this week. This morning, however, the Fed drained reserves from the banking system when the overnight interest rate subject to its direct control slipped below the current target of 4 1/2 percent. This action was aimed at steadying rates, though analysts did not rule out later action to cut them. [Page D14.]
The housing figures followed by a day a Federal Reserve report showing that industrial production also fell in November, by four-tenths of a percent, after posting virtually no growth for three months.
In the housing report, the Commerce Department said new construction of single-family homes and apartments totaled a seasonally adjusted 1.066 million last month, down from 1.089 million in October. The decline was entirely in apartments.
"We are now guaranteed the lowest total since World War II," said David F. Seiders, an economist at the National Association of Home Builders.
The housing weakness was widespread. Starts fell in both the Midwest and West and barely rose in the South. Only the Northeast posted a sizable gain.
Starts in the first 11 months of the year were 16.5 percent below the 1990 period, and analysts said the 1991 total would be less than the 1.015 million units built in 1946 as the nation began to recover from the war. There had been just 325,000 starts in 1945.
"If we get a number in December that doesn't fall off the cliff, we will come in about 1.004 million for '91," Mr. Seiders said. "Even in 1982, one of the deepest recessions in memory, we had 1.062 million starts."
The revised 7.1 percent jump in October was the biggest advance since a 17.1 percent gain in February, when the housing industry began emerging from its recession.
But the increase was not as big as the 7.3 percent advance initially reported last month. And the 3.7 percent drop in September was a bit deeper than the original 3.5 percent estimate.
John A. Tuccillo, an economist with the National Association of Realtors, attributed the weakness to "a lapse in consumer confidence, diminished demand and the ongoing financing struggle in the building industry."
Analysts said snow and cold temperatures in November also curbed construction in some areas, particularly the Midwest.
But applications for building permits -- often a barometer of future activity -- suggested continued weakness. They fell 2.9 percent, to a 998,000 annual rate, after rising 4.5 percent a month earlier.
Despite the bleak outlook for 1991, analysts said the housing industry should resume growth early next year. Richard Peach, an economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association, said there were already reports of more prospective buyers looking at homes. As sales pick up, builders usually resume construction.

HEADLINE: A Base for Post-Apartheid Profits

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, Dec. 17

 BODY:
Among all the departures of American companies from South Africa, perhaps none has had such a spectacular aftermath as the disinvestment of the Mobil Oil Corporation in 1989. The facilities it left behind have provided the catalyst for one of the more remarkable success stories in Africa's petroleum industry.
Mobil's oil refining and marketing operation was purchased for a little more than $230 million, a fraction of its value, by Gencor Ltd., the mining and industrial conglomerate. Since the birth of the new subsidiary, Engen (an abbreviation of Energy Gencor), in July 1989, the oil operation has generated such profits that Gencor could recoup its investment before the end of 1992. 
 And though its success may be the most noteworthy, Engen is only one of several South African units that were sold off by United States companies because of apartheid and are now benefiting from that institution's dismantling. Countries that once shunned trading with South Africa are beginning to show a willingess to do business with the nation's companies.
 
The de Klerk Track
 Mobil announced its departure from South Africa in April 1989, only months before F. W. de Klerk became President and transformed the political climate. But as Rob J. Angel, Engen's managing director, observed: "Everybody's wonderful being a Monday morning quarterback. Nobody but nobody expected de Klerk to come in eight months later and start South Africa on the track on which it's essentially continued from that time on."
Many businesses that were sold when American corporations left seem likely to keep operating independently in a post-apartheid South Africa, despite the lifting of economic sanctions by the Bush Administration in July. General Motors, for example, is not expected to buy back its former subsidiary in Port Elizabeth, which manufactures Opel automobiles as a local corporation called Delta Motors. The effect of such disinvestment is to leave South Africa with a home-grown industrial base that needs foreign investment, but does not need the old parent corporations.
Gencor was known for its mining, industrial and financial activities. But it also had a cluster of service stations operating under the name Trek, an interest in another fuel distributor called Sonap and investments in natural gas exploration off Africa's southernmost coast -- interests that, together, justified creating an energy division.
"But the thing they saw lacking was that they really had no core to that critical mass," Mr. Angel recalled. "They concluded that the only way they were going to develop that was to make a major acquisition."
The Mobil operation in South Africa that Gencor bought for a little more than 650 million rand, currently about $232 million, included a chain of service stations -- Engen now has more than 1,500 -- an oil refinery and some lesser assets. The liabilities included more than $100 million in debts inherited from Mobil's capital restructuring before it left.
Gencor persuaded Mr. Angel, a 49-year-old Australian chemical engineer who ran Mobil's operation in southern Africa, to stay on as the new managing director of Engen. Gencor agreed to avoid laying off any Mobil employees for a year and has since expanded the work force by 10 percent, to 3,700 people.
 
Rewards for Loyalty
 To insure loyalty, the company offered employees new stock at less than $4 a share, a third of the initial price. And Gencor has continued the work of the Mobil Foundation -- renamed the Energos Foundation -- which was heavily involved in social and economic projects for black South Africans.
Although South Africa remains in a recession and is starved for foreign capital, Engen's net income jumped by more than 34 percent, to the equivalent of $103 million, in the fiscal year ended Aug. 30. Dividends on its shares rose 20 percent. With a total market capitalization of $2 billion, Engen has become the seventh-largest industrial company listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.
Americans can buy shares in Engen or other South African stocks through any of the major United States brokerages that handle them.
Engen now exports petroleum products to 15 other African countries and island states in the Indian Ocean. This accounts for only 5 percent of its sales volume, but Engen is expanding Mobil's old refinery in Durban to meet projected demand. A new issue of 44 million shares last March was snapped up, raising more than $390 million in fresh capital.
Engen's best asset is probably the potential market in sub-Saharan Africa. South Africa has no exploitable oil reserves, although because of sanctions it does manufacture fuel from coal and natural gas.
The South African Government purchases its oil quietly from other countries, often through middlemen, and subsidizes the resale to local wholesalers like Engen. Mr. Angel declined to discuss the arrangement, which the Government keeps secret because it circumvents the oil embargo placed on South Africa by the United Nations.
 
'We Can Compete Successfully'
 Sanctions notwithstanding, Engen has found that it can profitably import crude oil to Durban for refining and then market the finished product to the neighboring African countries willing to trade with it.
"Crude oil has to be processed somewhere," said John Roberts, Engen's financial director. "I think we can compete successfully against the Persian Gulf and against Singapore."
Mr. Angel said that South Africa's competitive refining costs offset the higher initial costs of shipping the crude oil to Durban. "We've got a pretty strong competitive position with places that are effectively just on our doorstep," Mr. Angel said. "Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Zambia, Zaire are really just natural markets for us." Engen is expanding its market farther north into Kenya.
To service sub-Saharan Africa, Engen is expanding and upgrading its Durban refinery, which will eventually raise production capacity to 150,000 barrels a day. The first phase, costing $225 million, will increase capacity 30 percent by next August. The second phase should cost about $535 million.
South African refineries have generally not been as large as those overseas, Mr. Angel said, "but as regards sophistication, they're probably ahead of the vast bulk of refineries in Europe."
 
Looking at Broader Markets
 Though Mr. Roberts said that Engen is primarily a marketing and refining company, it is becoming a more active trader, buying and selling oil that never reaches South Africa and planning to set up an office in Switzerland to improve its trading position.
By now, Engen has developed an inside knowledge of the crude oil market. "When U.N. sanctions go, we will start developing direct links between ourselves and producers," Mr. Angel said. "We've then got a few cards in our hands. We will not be an insignificant producer of crude oil."
Engen hopes to produce half of its own oil by the end of the decade. It has joined consortiums exploring for oil in Namibia and West Africa. And it has bought 27 percent of Gencor's 8 percent interest in the vast Alba oilfield and Kilda gas field under the North Sea off northeast Scotland.
Engen executives seem comfortable operating independently of Mobil.
The purchase agreement has precluded Engen from sharing Mobil's technology since July 1989. Engen must devise its own lubricants, for example, to replace outdated Mobil formulas. But Mr. Roberts is undaunted.
"The vast majority of technology is commercially available," he said, including a broad variety unavailable from Mobil. "Sometimes when you're part of a family, you're locked out of another family's technology."
By July 1994, Engen must also drop the Mobil trademark for its products, but as Mr. Angel said, "A new name really doesn't worry me."
Engen has attained significant independence, not only from Mobil but even from Gencor, and Engen executives appreciate having a free hand.
 
'We Were Stagnating'
 "Under the Mobil Corporation banner, we were stagnating; things are a little different now," said Barry Hurt, Engen's director of corporate relations. "All the projects we wanted to get involved with, where funds weren't forthcoming, suddenly started happening."
Although Mobil usually sent in a team of outsiders to handle major changes in its South African operations, Mr. Angel and his managers now do it themselves.
The growth of Engen testifies to local business confidence as South Africa moves toward democratic majority rule. Mr. Angel observed that whatever government came to power would need a thriving oil industry.
"The road into the future has not been and will not be a smooth one," Mr. Angel said. "But I think being South African, we can take a broader view of the risks than perhaps a multinational."

Dollar Ends the Day Lower As Cut in Rates Is Expected

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar closed lower yesterday in a session dominated by speculation over when the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again.
Many economists expect the Fed to cut interest rates soon, perhaps by today, as part of its continuing campaign to arouse a languid economy. 
 Andrew Hodge, vice president at Bank Brussels Lambert, said the dollar fell slightly about noon after the Fed drained funds from the banking system. The move surprised economists, who were expecting the Fed to add reserves as a means to lower rates. Despite the Fed's action, economists still believe rates will move lower.
A country's currency generally declines when its central bank lowers interest rates, a move that generally makes the currency less valuable to foreign investors. Mr. Hodge said the Fed's next move was so widely expected that he doubted the dollar would be hurt.
So far this year, the Fed has cut the discount rate four times, shaving two percentage points off the fee on its loans to Fed member banks. The rate now stands at 4 1/2 percent.
Despite the expectations about the Fed's action, Hubert Pedroli of Credit Suisse said the economy's poor performance provided a weak backdrop for the dollar.
"I think the trend is kind of unchanged," said Mr. Pedroli, Credit Suisse's manager of corporate foreign exchange. "Whether the Fed does anything or doesn't do anything, the dollar will still be under pressure."
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 128.28 yen, down 0.17 yen from Monday's close. Later, in London, the dollar was quoted at a higher rate of 128.30 yen. At closing in New York, the dollar was at 128.29 yen, down from 128.40 late Monday.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.8200, from $1.8210 late Monday. At closing in New York, sterling cost $1.8275, more expensive than $1.8245 late Monday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's rates, included: 1.5703 German marks, down from 1.5750; 1.3885 Swiss francs, down from 1.3935; 5.3635 French francs, down from 5.3805; 1,187.00 Italian lire, down from 1,188.75, and 1.14615 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1428.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates Monday, included: 1.5770 German marks, down from 1.5785; 1.3930 Swiss francs, down from 1.3945; 5.3845 French francs, down from 5.3895; 1.7750 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7780; 1,190.00 Italian lire, down from 1,191.25, and 1.1451 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1429.

Dep to Withdraw Stock Offering

 BODY:
The Dep Corporation, a Los Angeles-based maker of hair and skin-care products, said yesterday that it planned to withdraw its registration statement involving an offering of 1.7 million common shares. Robert Berglass, the chairman and president, cited "poor market conditions and the current price of the company's stock" as the primary considerations in the company's decision. 
 Also yesterday, Don E. Marsh, the president and chief executive of Marsh Supermarkets Inc. in Indianapolis, said the company planned to withdraw its registration statement regarding 3.9 million class B common shares because of economic conditions. He said the company's post-Thanksgiving sales were lower than expected.

HEADLINE: As Costs of New Drugs Rise, Hospitals Stick by Old Ones

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
When the CIBA-Geigy Corporation came out with a new arthritis drug two years ago, it filled medical journals with advertisements, hired Mickey Mantle with his arthritic knees as a spokesman and deployed representatives across the nation to leave free samples of the drug, Voltaren, in hospital doctors' lounges.
But at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, the campaign fell flat. The hospital's pharmacy committee decided that older, less expensive drugs were just as effective. The hospital's pharmacy would not stock Voltaren, the committee decreed, and its doctors should not use it. The hospital prohibited company representatives from promoting the drug on hospital premises or even mentioning it. 
 In the last five years, the hospital has rejected or placed restrictions on dozens of drugs.
 
Drugs at $3,000 a Dose
 "I get some flak from doctors and drug companies, but there's generally less of a fight than I would predict," said Harold DeMonaco, the hospital's chief of pharmacy. "I put on my white coat as a clinician and say, 'what we have already is just as good.' Then I put on my suit as an administrator and say, 'and by the way, it's cheaper.' "
As drug costs rise as much as 10 percent a year for hospitals, and with some bioengineered drugs selling for as much as $3,000 a dose, many hospitals are buying expensive new wonder drugs judiciously and limiting the drugs to the patients who are most likely to be helped by them.
Some institutions have even begun aggressive counter-advertising campaigns: when a drug company hands out a mug promoting a new fourth-generation antibiotic, the hospital counters with note pads reminding doctors of cheaper alternatives.
But the hospitals are battling a formidable foe. According to a recent Senate report, the pharmaceutical industry spends $10 billion a year on marketing, more than the roughly $9 billion spent on research and development. Industry analysts say companies spend more than $5,000 per doctor per year on marketing activities.
"Pharmacy budgets keep going up and up and up, and we're under increasing pressure to keep down costs," said Dr. Arthur Atkinson, chief of the pharmacy committee at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. Medicare, Medicaid and, in many states, private insurance plans pay a lump sum to hospitals for each patient according to the diagnosis, so the real costs of drugs are not passed on by the hospital to the patient. Some drugs about to go on the market cost more than a hospital is paid for a patient's entire stay.
Used properly, even thousand-dollar drugs can be money savers if they reduce the need for long hospital stays, said Dr. Stephen Schondelmeyer, an economist at the University of Minnesota. But that is rarely the case. So the new cost-consciousness means that hospitalized patients are less likely to be given the latest drug if its added benefits seem slim compared to its added cost. "If we spend dollars unwisely on expensive new products, another patient may not get the medicine he needs," Dr. Schondelmeyer said.
At some hospitals, doctors are forbidden to prescribe drugs that are not accepted by the pharmacy as cost-effective; at others, the drugs are allowed only with special permission. In some cases, pharmacists monitor doctors' prescribing habits and challenge those who order drugs that could be replaced by effective but cheaper alternatives.
 
Reining in Companies
 Most often, the restrictions apply to drugs still covered by patents; with drugs on which the patents have expired, most hospitals long ago abandoned brand name products for their generic equivalents.
In addition, many hospitals now restrict the activities of the freewheeling drug company representatives, called detail men.
Kaiser Permanente, a health maintenance organization in California, changed an open-door policy for drug company representatives at its 15 hospitals in northern California when "we realized that by remaining passive we were supporting marketing interests that we didn't agree with," said Francis J. Crosson, the company's associate executive director.
Under the new policy, representatives wear identifying badges and may enter only by appointment; seven pharmaceutical companies have been banished for six months for offenses that included paying $100 to doctors to attend dinners sponsored by the companies and improperly filling out applications, usually completed by doctors, to get drugs adopted by hospital pharmacies.
Virtually all hospitals have combined their policing efforts with moves to educate doctors about cost-effective drug use. Three years ago, Kaiser began hiring "counter-detail men," or pharmacists who roam the hospitals drumming up support for older, less expensive drugs. Mimicking the drug company representatives, they give free lunches and have mugs, calendars and pens produced bearing inspirational messages.
Often doctors appreciate the advice.
"Nobody from the drug industry details the cheap stuff, they only detail the new and wondrous," said Mr. DeMonaco of Massachusetts General. "So young doctors have a paucity of information about old standards like ampicillin, and are hounded to use expensive new antibiotics."
Some industry analysts have predicted that drug costs, which now make up less than 10 percent of most hospital budgets, could rise to 30 percent of operating expenses over the next decade, largely because of costly new medicines, said Dr. R. A. Branch, head of the Center for Clinical Pharmacology at the University of Pittsburgh. Kaiser's drug budget, even with intensive cost-control measures, has doubled since 1985, and Massachusetts General's pharmacy costs are rising an average of 9 percent a year.
 
Budget-Consuming Drugs
 Already, hospitals have seen how the advent of a single new drug can quickly eat up a hefty chunk of the budget. Toradol, a non-narcotic painkiller introduced last year for use after surgery, alone accounts for about 6 percent of many hospitals' drug costs. And hospital administrators are quaking at the impending release of Centoxin, a bioengineered medicine that is used in tandem with antibiotics to treat a type of overwhelming infection of the blood called sepsis when it is caused by certain bacteria. In Europe, where Centoxin is already on the market, the drug is selling for $3,800 a dose.
For about 20 percent of patients, the drug may make the difference between life and death, but for the rest it offers little help. However, tests that show who will benefit take two days; if doctors wait, patients who might benefit may die. Hospitals around the country are developing guidelines for the use of the drug.
"If we give it to everyone with septic shock, we could consume about 30 percent of our budget for pharmaceuticals and couldn't purchase cancer drugs or antibiotics," said Dr. Michael Rie, an intensive-care specialist at the University of Kentucky.
In many cases, however, drugs that cost far more than the medicines they replace offer advantages that are almost imperceptible or simply cosmetic.
Although either ampicillin, the old standby, or Suprax, a new antibiotic, will treat the average sore throat or respiratory infection, the new drug has a somewhat better cure rate against the rare resistant germ and need only be taken once a day, as opposed to four times for the older antibiotic. But ampicillin costs 10 cents a pill, compared with $10 a pill for Suprax.
In intensive-care units, patients can be sedated using a combination of new drugs given intravenously, for $10,000 a week, or using older drugs, whose patents have expired, for several hundred dollars. The new combination is slightly less irritating to the veins and its effects can be reversed more quickly when the patient is ready to come off the breathing machine.
 
Deals on Some Drugs
 With some newer classes of drugs, all the alternatives are still covered by exclusive patents and hospitals frequently negotiate discounted prices by agreeing to limit prescriptions to one product.
For drug companies, each decision by a pharmacy can yield pay dirt or dust. And so, when Northwestern Memorial decided on the Merck drug, Smith-Kline complained to the hospital's president about the decision -- and was overruled.
Where not restricted, drug company representatives know how to let themselves into locked lounges and continue to lavish doctors with gifts. After a recent agreement between the pharmaceutical industry and the American Medical Association to halt the practice of providing large equipment and expensive vacations to doctors, smaller prizes remain acceptable.
Hospital pharmacies have to work hard to limit costly prescribing under this sort of pressure. At Massachusetts General the pharmacy committee decided to stock Toradol, the pain medicine, but allows its routine use in only a limited number of chest-surgery patients. Independent studies have shown that for most people who have had operations, morphine works just as well if not better in the day after surgery, Mr. DeMonaco said, and it costs 16 cents, instead of the $6 per dose for the other drug.
 
Not for Sore Throats
 Many hospitals, like Kaiser, have published guidelines to help doctors select the proper drug for a given condition and have monitored their adherence to the advice. "If people need to use very expensive antibiotics for life-threatening infections, that's fine, but we don't want them used for sore throats," Dr. Atkinson said.
Massachusetts General now has a pharmacist on every ward to review doctors' drug orders and to encourage cost-effective prescribing.
Hospitals that have invested heavily in controlling costs say their programs have worked. Dr. Tracie Paiva, a pharmacist at Kaiser, is proud of the note pads printed to look like decks of cards, reading "Lisinopril, Kaiser's ACE of Hearts," promoting a cost-effective blood-pressure drug. "Since we started our program, our prescribing patterns have become very different than most other hospitals," she said.

HEADLINE: Family Rituals Dickens Could Hardly Imagine

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER

 BODY:
MENTION Christmas in most American households and visions of seasonal rituals dance like sugarplums.
Decorating the home, last-minute gift shopping and creamy eggnog dusted with nutmeg top a long list of things associated with the Christmas season, that traditional time of homecoming and cheer for Christians and many non-Christians alike. 
But there are family rituals -- some new, some as old as Yule logs and mistletoe -- that are not always recognized as such. Social researchers say that structural changes in family life and the external culture's entry into the family circle in the form of television have exerted powerful influences on how Christmas is observed, despite what appears to be a common longing to preserve the traditional ways of celebrating. These are some examples:
* The shouting match is rarely cited as a holiday ritual, but in many families it wouldn't be Christmas without one.
* If voices of carolers drifting through a frosty night are the idealized sounds of Christmas, the voice of George Bailey cursing his bad fortune in the Frank Capra film "It's a Wonderful Life" on television is more often heard in American homes.
* While Christmas dinner for family and friends is celebrated as a unifying ritual, working women are finding it difficult to spend the hours preparing it.
* And the ritual debate on materialism that accompanies gift giving is played out this year against a gloomy economic backdrop that invites guilt for spending too much or too little.
The day itself, whether observed with religious piety or festive holiday spirit, touches emotional roots so deep that nearly everyone has adopted rituals associated with it. This is true even if, like Scrooge, the ritual for some is the effort to ignore Christmas.
When events like divorce and remarriage take place and Christmas-time rituals are forced to accommodate newcomers to a family setting, the changes can be very disturbing. But some authorities, like Dr. Steven J. Wolin, a Washington psychiatrist, think it is a good thing that the rituals don't remain static.
"An issue that keeps coming up in my clinical work is that people don't realize ritual involves both continuity and change," Dr. Wolin said. "They think it's all continuity. People feel if they are changing holiday rituals they must be doing it wrong. I tell them if they don't change, the rituals will become hollow and die."
Still, there can be fierce resistance.
Because of powerful childhood memories that haunt the back corridors of the mind, it is not unusual for grown-ups to become cross and pouty if prized Christmas rituals are challenged or usurped.
How many newly married couples find themselves disagreeing on ways to trim a Christmas tree, asked Dr. William J. Doherty, director of the marriage and family therapy program at the University of Minnesota. What if one grew up in a family that meticulously decorated each branch with tinsel, strand by silvery strand, and the other came from a long line of tinsel-tossers? What if he comes from a blue spruce family and she from a family of Douglas fir fanciers?
Something more than esthetics, Dr. Doherty proposed, is at work in such cases. The "correct way" in the mind of each spouse may be an emotionally potent link to a parent, dead or alive. Thus, breaking with childhood memories in the reverential glow of Christmas can invite anger or tears.
The list of possible conflicts is long: When to put up the tree and when to take it down? Are stockings hung even after the children have grown and moved away? How come mashed turnips are still served now that Uncle Harry is dead -- he's the only one who liked them?
"In our family, one of our biggest traditions is our annual Christmas Eve fight over who's not helping out," said Dr. Lee Combrinck-Graham, a family therapist and associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Illinois in Chicago. "It's useful to recognize that while the holidays are supposed to be fun, there's often a lot of tension building along with our expectations. Sometimes, these tensions need to be released before we can enjoy ourselves."
But many people dread Christmas because of the feelings of loneliness it awakens if family or friends are dead, estranged or live far away.
Even when families get together, who sits around the dinner table may be dictated more by a custody settlement in a divorce than by choice. Like in-laws, stepparents and stepchildren have to tiptoe a minefield of misunderstandings, and the atmosphere can turn explosive if competing notions on Christmas ritual collide.
"One of the great rituals of Christmas is lying," Dr. Doherty said. "Saying you love the gift you really hate is one lie. Saying the turkey is delicious even when it's dry and overdone is what loving families do.
"But a 15-year old stepdaughter at her stepmother's table may have no incentive to fake it. Instead you get a turning up of the nose and, 'This isn't the way Mom makes the stuffing!' "
Women, sociologists agree, are most often the keepers of family rituals, more likely than men to perpetuate them. Yet as women have moved into the work force, the effort and time needed to prepare a traditional Christmas dinner depresses those who feel they can't keep up with the demands made on them.
"Trying to pull off a big Christmas dinner today requires incredible changes on everyone's part, but unfortunately the job is approached as though it's still women's work," said Dr. Evan Imber-Black, professor of psychiatry at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx.
Fran Sevcik, director of public relations for Kloster Cruise Ltd. of Miami, said she had tired herself out trying to celebrate both Hanukkah and Christmas with her husband and two young children.
"You try to rush home on Christmas Eve and do everything and you get frazzled," she said. This year, she said, the family decided to spend Christmas at Disney World.
Television, which has its own rituals, can be another intrusion.
Viewers may be warmed and heartened by watching, year after year, the wringing emotional experience of "It's a Wonderful Life," in which a man learns the value of his life at Christmas, or by watching football games, but many families get together so infrequently these days that turning on the television can nullify the ritual of storytelling that keeps family histories alive.
Francine Hermelin, a University of Michigan student, recalled that last year, she spent Thanksgiving at her grandmother's home, talking for hours after the meal with older relatives about family history.
"That was a very important experience for me and I looked forward to doing it again this Thanksgiving," she said. "But it was crazy. 'E.T.' was on television and we all ran to watch it before we were quite through eating. We hardly spoke all night."
Suzanne Mercure of Boston, a business manager who is divorced, plans to spend Christmas Eve with her parents but said she would not stay overnight. Instead, she said she would spend Christmas day with casual friends "who can't get back to where they come from to be with their families," the bands of single and divorced, orphaned and emotionally distant, who inhabit all the cities of America.
Ms. Mercure says she has adopted two new Christmas rituals.
"I telephone around the country to friends I haven't been in touch with all year," she explained. She said Christmas cards and postage now amount to $1 for each card and she finds a greater emotional resonance in hearing a friend's voice.
The other takes place on Christmas night at home, alone, when she plays a videotape of her favorite movie, "The Velveteen Rabbit."
"It's a story about a child who thinks toys are not real," Ms. Mercure said. "He learns if you are loved, you are real."

BYLINE: By Jane E. Brody

 BODY:
DEPRESSION has long been considered primarily a women's disease. The rate for women being treated and in community surveys, in fact, is two to six times as high asfor men.
Now it looks as if men could be starting to catch up. Economic and social pressures and a greater willingness by men and doctors to recognize and discuss emotional problems may eventually whittle away the statistical difference. Still, according to a recent analysis involving more than 23,000 patients and 500 medical practitioners, many more mistakes are made in recognizing depression in men than in women. 
 The study, published in the current issue of the journal Psychological Assessment, found that clinicians outside the mental health field failed to recognize symptoms of depression in two-thirds of the men as against half the women who were found to be suffering from it using standardized tests. Furthermore, the clinicians in the study were more likely to diagnose depression in women when in fact they were not suffering from it, according to the test results.
 
Differences by Sex
 Historically, it has been considered "unmanly" to admit to suffering from emotional problems. Rather than seek medical help for depression or even acknowledge that they may have such a problem, many men have traditionally handled their feelings by drinking too much alcohol, taking mood-altering drugs, being cranky and irritable or falsely cheerful, abusing their wives or children, becoming workaholics or exercise addicts or, with little or no warning, committing suicide.
On top of this, many doctors have been reluctant to delve into the emotions with their male patients or even to ask "embarrassing" questions that might reveal alcohol or drug abuse. Another obstacle to detecting depression in men is that men are only half as likely as women to visit a doctor.
Women, on the other hand, see doctors far more regularly. Facing less social stigma about emotional problems, women generally feel more comfortable than men in talking about their bad feelings and are more inclined to confront them rather than to try to drown them in pills and alcohol. Doctors, too, have been less reluctant to quiz female patients about their emotional health and more likely to conclude that women with certain hallmark symptoms are in fact depressed.
To be sure, even when diagnostic errors are taken into account, depression is still considered to be a more common affliction among women. Dr. Myrna M. Weissman, professor of epidemiology in psychiatry at Columbia University, and her husband, Dr. Gerald L. Klerman, professor of psychiatry at Cornell University Medical Center, have analyzed scores of studies in the United States and many other countries. They find that while depression affects young boys and girls with equal frequency, after puberty girls and women are about twice as susceptible.
 
Shifting Causes
 The distribution is probably related, in part, to hormonal factors; for example premenstrual and postpartum depression are common and well recognized. But it may also reflect social pressures that affect men and women differently. For example, Dr. Klerman said, while the women's movement may have succeeded in raising social awareness about the need for men to participate more in household chores and child-rearing, in most households women with outside jobs still do the lion's share.
"There has been a distinct rise in depression among young women, and a main reason for it is that the promises to women have not been fulfilled," Dr. Klerman said.
For both men and women, Dr. Weissman said, feeling powerful and in control is a potent antidote to depression. "Maybe different things make men and women feel powerful and in control, though that is likely to be less so as women's and men's roles become more similar," she said.
Rates of depression have been increasing worldwide in both men and women born after World War II. If indeed there has been a disproportionate increase in depression among men, Dr. Klerman suggested socioeconomic factors as a prominent cause. Many men can no longer reinforce their social dominance by holding "macho" jobs. Instead, more men today hold unisex jobs and are forced to compete with women.
In the last few years, extensive layoffs and forced retirements have compounded the problem. A disproportionate number of men are out of work, suffering from lost status and battered self-esteem on top of often severe economic pressures, a perfect formula for depression.
Dr. Harold M. Visotsky, director of the Center for the Study of Depressive Disorders at Northwestern University, noted that "as women get more involved in male roles and move up career ladders, they are beginning to be more susceptible to anxiety and depression as a result of job stress."
 
Recognizing Signs
 Many people, especially men, suppress their emotional symptoms and instead express their depression through their bodies. They may suffer often from headaches, vague abdominal pains, muscle aches and pains, fatigue or gastrointestinal disturbances. Others try to self-medicate their bad feelings with alcohol or drugs like nicotine and cocaine.
Manifestations of depression can vary widely from individual to individual, but certain signs and symptoms are common. They include a loss of interest in formerly pleasurable activities and a generalized inertia, an inability to help oneself or accept help from others. Some people thwart the efforts of others to help by becoming touchy, curt or sarcastic. Indeed, many depressed people believe that nothing can help them or that they do not deserve to be helped. Others feel ashamed or inappropriately guilty, thinking that they should be able to snap out of it.
Loss of appetite and sleep disturbances -- insomnia (especially early-morning awakening) or excessive sleepiness -- are common signs of depression. Also common is a general slowing down of mental and physical activities, a phenomenon called psychomotor retardation. Depressed people often have difficulty concentrating and thinking clearly and doing work they once did easily.
 
Getting Help
 Even when the causes of depression are obvious, like loss of employment, divorce or death of a loved one, professional counseling, group therapy and sometimes treatment with antidepressant medication can help greatly to relieve the anguish. Pastoral counseling or at community mental health centers can help those without enough money or insurance.
If nothing else, try joining a self-help group. There are now many men's groups as well as women's groups in urban areas. Participation in regular physical activity is another valuable antidote to depression.
Above all, do not wait until the demons of depression result in alcohol or drug abuse, spouse or child abuse or, worst of all, suicide.

Bankers Trust Raises Dividend

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The Bankers Trust New York Corporation has raised its quarterly dividend by 10 percent because it did better than expected in the recession. The New York-based bank group said the quarterly dividend would be raised to 70 cents a share from 63.5 cents a share. 
 Bankers Trust said it expected fourth-quarter profits to equal those of a year ago, when the company recorded quarterly earnings of $123 million, or $1.40 a share. It earned $665 million, or $7.80 a share, for all of 1990. The higher dividend is payable on Jan. 25 for all stockholders of record as of Jan. 2. Bankers Trust stock fell $2.50 on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, to $61.125. Analysts said they had expected the fourth-quarter results to be higher than those of a year ago.

Mets Fans Paying the Price

 BODY:
Inside a parka and under a frozen sky, the man slid through the line and strode up to Window 4 at Shea Stadium yesterday. "Hey, hey, you can't cut the line," cried some of the people standing on line, their breath visible, their anger real. "Wait your turn."
The man in the parka turned around and Jeff Torborg smiled. The voices went silent for a second as the new manager of the Mets addressed his accusers. There was surprise but not embarrassment. 
 "Hey, you got the best seat in the place already," one person croaked.
Tickets for most of the rest of the seats at Shea Stadium for the 1992 season went on sale yesterday, and a line of 300 was present for the 9 A.M. start. By 6 P.M., the Mets had sold 51,000 seats, up from the roughly 40,000 the club sold on the first day of sales a year ago.
"We can't separate ourselves from the rest of the city with respect to the economy, and it's a tough economy," said General Manager Al Harazin. "We have been perceived as disappointing and plainly not interesting lately. I wanted to improve that perception. We're in the entertainment business."

Jays-Red Sox Rivalry: Bids for Top Pitchers

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
This will be a critical day in the immediate future of two pitchers who between them have pitched 366 victories, 807 games and 5,629 innings. Jack Morris and Frank Viola, veteran free agents both, are the dual targets of a dual pursuit, and at least one decision could clarify the pursuit at least in part today.
The Toronto Blue Jays and the Boston Red Sox, who have fought each other for the American League East championship several times in recent years, are both trying to sign Morris or Viola. Morris is scheduled to visit Toronto today and will very likely accept what one baseball official familiar with the Blue Jays' plans said was an offer of more than $10 million for two years. 
 "The intent is to sign one or the other, not both," Gord Ash, the assistant general manager, said by telephone from Toronto. He acknowledged that the club had made offers to both pitchers, adding, "We left it that the first one to come forward and accept would have a deal."
Was there any chance the Blue Jays would sign both? "It would be a slim chance," Ash said.
 
2 for Morris, 1 for Viola
 The baseball person who spoke of the offer to Morris said it was a two-year contract with an option for a third year. He said the Blue Jays had offered Viola a one-year deal that would enable him to be a free agent again next year.
The Red Sox, who also seek an established starting pitcher, have talked to agents for both pitchers. The Red Sox, in fact, hope that Morris's visit to Toronto is a failure because if he doesn't reach agreement with the Blue Jays, he plans to visit Boston tomorrow.
But there seemed to be a strong chance that Morris would accept the Blue Jays' offer, which was said to be one that would put him on the economic level of Roger Clemens and Dwight Gooden. They are baseball's highest-paid pitchers with contracts averaging more than $5 million a year.
Neither Richard Moss, Morris's lawyer, nor Craig Fenech, Viola's agent, returned telephone calls seeking comment on their clients' plans.
 
Three-Year Pact Rejected
 Viola would have to decide whether or not he wants to accept a one-year contract with Toronto. Last April, he rejected the Mets' three-year offer for $13 million, and no one has admitted to having made him as good an offer since he became a free agent last month.
By tomorrow's midnight deadline, he could accept the Mets' offer of salary arbitration and thus retain his right to be a free agent again a year from now. But a recent development has opened the door for players to be in position to sign with a team other than their previous team and not be restricted by the five-year waiting period for a second free agency.
That's how Morris became a free agent again this year after just one season with the Twins. Once he did not exercise the option for 1992 in his contract with Minnesota, he became a free agent because the Twins did not offer him salary arbitration.
The Blue Jays could agree not to offer Viola arbitration next year, thus allowing him to go free for 1993. Then he could sign with any team, including the expansion teams, the Colorado Rockies and the Florida Marlins, who will be in business by then.
 
Second-Half Slump
 Although Fenech has been noncommunicative about his negotiations for Viola, officials of various teams have questioned whether or not he has had attractive multiyear offers. The 31-year-old Viola, a left-hander who has never missed a start because of injury, has apparently had the market for him hurt by his performance in the second half of the season.
After he compiled an 11-5 record in his first 19 starts with the Mets in 1991, Viola slumped badly and won only 2 games while losing 10 in his last 17 starts.
He attributed his collapse to problems he had with two fingers on his pitching hand. The problems have since dissipated or been corrected. Word circulated throughout baseball immediately after the season that Viola had elbow problems, too, but Fenech sent medical reports to all of the teams showing that the pitcher had no such problems.
The Blue Jays have two starters whose status could have a question mark attached next season. One is left-hander Jimmy Key, who broke an ankle on Sunday and will be in a cast for the next four weeks. The other is right-hander Dave Stieb, who was limited to nine starts last season because of shoulder and back ailments. The Blue Jays have no guarantee he will be sound at the start of the season.
Another starter, Tom Candiotti, who joined the rotation after being acquired from Cleveland on June 27, signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers as a free agent, leaving Todd Stottlemyre, Juan Guzman and David Wells as the Blue Jays' starters.
 
INSIDE PITCH
 BOB KIPPER, a 27-year-old free-agent reliever, agreed yesterday to a $1 million, one-year contract with the Minnesota Twins. Kipper was 2-2 with a 4.65 earned run average in 52 relief appearances for Pittsburgh last season, when he earned $900,000. He gets a $100,000 signing bonus and $900,000 in 1992. The Twins have an option for 1993 at $1 million, which becomes guaranteed if Kipper pitches in 40 games next season. . . . The San Diego Padres dropped out of the bidding for the free-agent outfielder DANNY TARTABULL, saying they couldn't afford his request for a five-year contract at more than $4 million per season.

HEADLINE: Brutalizing the Helpless;
State Senate Republicans Target the Poor

 BODY:
The budget battle between Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York and the State Legislature is more partisan than usual this year. Senate Republicans seem to be using the impasse to tarnish Mr. Cuomo's credibility as a possible Democratic Presidential contender.
The struggle is over where to impose the harshest cuts -- on welfare and Medicaid recipients or on schoolchildren. That's a false and destructive choice. Fairness dictates careful cuts both in school aid and Medicaid and welfare. 
 Like other states in the Northeast, New York has been hit hard by the recession. Mr. Cuomo and the legislators must close an $875 million gap in this year's $30 billion budget and a projected $4 billion gap next year.
Considering the furious backlash against tax increases in New Jersey and Connecticut, raising taxes is not politically realistic. That means going after health, education and service programs, which make up close to 75 percent of the budget. The two big spending targets are social services, like welfare and Medicaid, and aid to local school districts.
Senate Republicans would impose almost all the cuts on social services. They propose to save $1.8 billion over 15 months by limiting Medicaid services and curtailing eligibility for welfare. They would reduce welfare grants to poor, unemployed single adults by 20 percent, stringently limit their Medicaid benefits and eliminate emergency assistance for the homeless.
By imposing such severe cuts, the Republicans aim to eliminate the need for cuts in aid to education, one of the plums that legislators take back home. It's true that most school districts suffered budget cuts last December and July. And many have growing enrollments. That's a powerful reason to make school aid cuts judiciously, not to exempt schools altogether.
Gov. Cuomo would spread the pain more fairly than the Republicans. He proposes cutting $1.2 billion from social programs and $840 million from the schools. Mr. Cuomo would limit not only Medicaid benefits for inner-city clients, but also nursing home and long-term care benefits that are used by the middle class.
In cutting school aid, the Governor would use a formula that takes into account each school district's relative wealth, thus easing the burden on poorer districts. That ought to offer some protection to New York City, which already receives less than its fair share of school aid while educating a disproportionate share of students with special needs.
In these tough times, Mr. Cuomo offers a better way to spread the pain than the Senate Republicans.

HEADLINE: Putting the Unemployed Back to Work

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Unemployment is at its highest in a decade. Many corporations are still cutting back their staffs and becoming overcautious about plans that involve expansion and rehiring. 
 What can Government do to get the economy moving forward again? Most suggested solutions would do more harm than good. They would either reduce Government revenues by cutting taxes or increase Government spending with new pump-priming programs. With our budget deficit, we simply can't afford that. Other suggested solutions are aimed at stimulating consumer spending, ignoring the underlying problem that spending is already too high and savings are too low.
Here's an idea that will not cut Government revenues, increase expenditures or stimulate spending at the expense of savings, but will reduce unemployment, encourage business to move forward with plans for expansion and all at no cost to the taxpayer: Enact legislation to permit corporations to deduct from their corporate income taxes for the next three years an amount exactly equal to what they withhold for income taxes from those they newly employ in calendar year 1992, who have been unemployed for more than four months. Companies would only be eligible if their total employment increased during the year by at least the number of new employees.
Such a plan would reduce the unemployment rolls by making it less expensive for corporations to hire new people. This would stimulate corporations to move forward with new products and new services, and, best of all, it would not cost the Treasury anything nor violate the budget agreement, since lower revenues from corporate income taxes would be exactly offset by higher revenues from individual income taxes of the newly re-employed.
Too good to be true? Maybe. What really happens is that the Government forgoes for three years the income taxes it otherwise would receive from the new employment. But since there are not likely to be any new income taxes without some new incentive, it looks like a reasonable trade-off.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
T. J. Maxx Parent Set to Branch Out

BYLINE: By Glenn Rifkin

 BODY:
BERNARD CAMMARATA, president and chief executive of the TJX Companies in Framingham, Mass., the parent of T. J. Maxx, the star of the $10 billion off-price retail apparel industry, is banking that its success will carry over to two new satellite ventures.
At an analysts' meeting today in New York, Mr. Cammarata plans to announce plans for some former Zayre properties that the company took over in a complex series of transactions with the bankrupt Ames Department Stores. 
 In the spring, TJX plans to open three units to offer home fashions at a sharp discount in warehouse-like settings of 50,000 square feet. The second concept, known as Value Mart, will be an indoor marketplace housing a collection of booths occupied by small, independent retailers. Four sites in Florida are scheduled to open soon.
Analysts credit Mr. Cammarata for engineering the company's success. He created T. J. Maxx for the Zayre Corporation in 1976 and has overseen T. J. Maxx's steady growth since then without a money-losing year. With 438 stores, the nationwide chain now accounts for 80 percent of TJX's revenues. It offers family-oriented, name-brand apparel at discounts of 20 percent to 60 percent and has brought in nearly $2 billion in revenues and operating profits estimated at $180 million this year.
"He pioneered the concept of an off-price apparel location where a woman can shop for the whole family," Richard Baum, a retail analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein, said. "They have offered outstanding value on merchandise and been very consistent about it."
Mr. Cammarata said the chain recently opened its first downtown location --in Chicago -- with "extremely" good results, and this year entered the Long Island market, where it plans to accelerate openings in the next few years.
Despite this success, however, most financial analysts cannot ignore the continuing disappointment with TJX's Hit or Miss division, which has dragged down profits and is to be downsized in 1992. Mr. Baum calculates that Hit or Miss lost $13 million through the first three quarters this year, and he expects a $20 million loss for the full year. And he does not expect the chain to break even next year. Revenues dropped from $385 million last year to some $370 million this year, according to Mr. Baum, and he expects flat growth next year.
"Hit or Miss had a very disappointing year," Mr. Cammarata said. "We've tried to transition this business in a very difficult economy for retailers."
The Hit or Miss small apparel shops for women -- the average store is 3,000 square feet -- are designed for strip malls. The division tried to gain momentum this year by shifting its focus to career-oriented merchandise for professional women. The timing could not have been worse, Mr. Baum said. "They beefed up their career apparel in a year when a lot of people are worrying about whether they have a career," Mr. Baum said.
Mr. Cammarata recently brought in Herbert Yalof, former president of Macy's northeast division, to serve as Hit or Miss's president, and earlier this year he recruited Michele Fortune, former chief executive of Ann Taylor, to head the chain's merchandising. He said the mix of casual and career clothes would move from 65-35 in favor of career wear to a 50-50 mix.
More importantly, TJX will trim the Hit or Miss chain, closing 70 of the 525 stores next year and opening some 20 for a net reduction of about 50.
"The turnaround is under way," said Skip Wells of Adams, Harkness & Hill in Boston. "But whether it succeeds won't be clear until 1992."
Mr. Baum said TJX stock, despite the Hit or Miss problems, was undervalued. The stock closed yesterday in New York Stock Exchange trading down 25 cents, to $15.375.
"The majority of the company is T. J. Maxx and that is quite healthy," Mr. Baum said. "I think the problems are overstated." He said T. J. Maxx was rapidly closing the gap on its larger competitor, Marshalls, and he estimated revenue growth of 12 percent, up to $2.15 billion this year, from $1.94 billion last year. "I think it can grow at that rate for several more years," Mr. Baum said.
Not all analysts are as bullish, given the Hit or Miss situation and the burden of the former Zayre properties. When Zayre was the parent of T. J. Maxx it negotiated a complex deal with Ames in which TJX was spun off as a separate company and Ames got the former Zayre properties. But, under the deal, TJX assumed responsibility for 119 former Zayre properties when Ames filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in 1990. That resulted in a $185 million write-off for TJX in 1990.
Mr. Cammarata says TJX has negotiated settlements or arranged alternative uses for 76 of the properties, leaving 43, and some of those will be used in the new ventures.
"TJX is handicapped by the extra 50-pound burden of Hit or Miss and the Ames situation," said Margo McGlade, an analyst with Paine Webber. "The question for investors is do they want to bet on T. J. Maxx and wait out the problems with Hit or Miss and Ames?"

HEADLINE: GENERAL MOTORS TO CUT 70,000 JOBS; 21 PLANTS TO SHUT

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Dec. 18

 BODY:
The General Motors Corporation, which has dominated the world automotive industry for generations, acknowledged today that it would probably never regain the huge share of the market that it enjoyed more than a decade ago.
In a wide retrenchment, G.M. said that it would close 21 of its 125 assembly and parts-making plants in North America over the next few years and eliminate more than 70,000 jobs, or nearly 18 percent of its employees in the United States and Canada. 
 G.M.'s steps, which the company signaled with a brief announcement last week, effectively pares 22 percent of the No. 1 auto maker's capacity to make cars and light trucks in North America.
 
Struggle Against Competition
 Ever since the late 1970's, when oil prices climbed and small foreign cars surged in popularity, G.M. has been struggling to halt the erosion of its share of the American car market, with little success. Quality problems plagued some of its early redesigned cars, which only fueled the sales of foreign manufacturers, many of which started selling larger cars and setting up plants in the United States.
While G.M., the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation all closed plants and reduced their workforces during the 1980's, G.M.'s steps, while painful to thousands who lost their jobs, were considered modest by automotive experts, given the magnitude of the company's problems.
 
Excess Capacity
 G.M. closed 11 older plants in 1986 and trimmed eight more assembly plants in October 1990. Still, it continued to have the plants and workers to build far more cars than the market wanted. Such excess capacity in a depressed sales year like 1991 gave the company losses on the order of $500 million a month.
Robert C. Stempel, G.M.'s chairman and chief executive, said that the immediate goal of the cutbacks was to restore profitability in North America, where G.M. faces an estimated $6 billion to $8 billion loss this year, its largest ever. But financial analysts said the changes would not help G.M. turn a profit before 1993.
By not specifying today which of the 21 plants would be closed, Mr. Stempel put the lives of thousands of workers in limbo. [Page D1.]
But he put some plants in a competition for survival against others that make identical products. For example, the plant in Arlington, Tex., near Fort Worth, that makes big Chevrolets, Buicks and Cadillacs, could be closed in favor of a plant that makes most of the same cars in Ypsilanti, Mich., near Ann Arbor. Mr. Stempel said a decision would not be made for months.
The nation's biggest auto maker becomes the latest American corporation to be forced to scale back its operations because of the recession and a fundamental restructuring of industries like transporation, computers and financial services.
In G.M.'s case, the recession aggravated the unpleasant consequences of an inefficient organization that uses more workers to make a car than any other auto maker.
"As I told our stockholders, we cannot blame our problems totally on the war, the plunge in consumer confidence, or the recession," Mr. Stempel said. "Rather, we must make fundamental changes in the way G.M. does business if we are to improve our performance."
He spoke over G.M.'s closed-circuit television network to approximately 400,000 workers in the United States and Canada. Afterward, a news conference was broadcast over the radio in some cities where G.M. has plants.
 
Skepticism From Union
 In Detroit, the United Automobile Workers union, which represents most of G.M.'s production workers, expressed skepticism at the urgency of the auto maker's travails, which it attributed to G.M. executives running scared of Wall Street.
Owen Bieber, the U.A.W. president, said, "The proper answer to the insatiable demands of the Ebenezer Scrooge types who run Wall Street is not a snappy 'Yes, sir!' salute."
He said G.M., by cutting capacity, had chosen a "self-defeating path." Mr. Bieber rejected the idea of granting G.M. concessions, and a spokesman said G.M. had not asked to reopen the three-year labor agreement, which expires in the fall of 1993.
On the New York Stock Exchange, G.M.'s common stock closed at $27.75 a share today, down 12.5 cents a share.
In coming months, Wall Street credit rating agencies will decide whether to lower their grade on G.M.'s debt securities, thereby raising G.M.'s costs of borrowing. Last s warned that they might issue G.M. a lower grade.
(nt questioning at today's news conference, Mr. Stempel said that G.M. must be profitable at whatever number of cars it is selling. By making the cutbacks, he said, the company aims to be able to make a profit with a market share "in the low 30" percent of the domestic vehicle market. In October, G.M.'s share was about 35 percent, down from 44.1 percent a decade ago, and 46 percent in 1978, just before oil prices jumped.
On the employment front, Mr. Stempel said the salaried work force, which stands now at 91,000 in North America, would be reduced to 71,000 by the mid-1990's, or approximately half the size it was in 1985. Likewise, the hourly work force, which stands at 304,000, will fall to about 250,000, also half the 1985 level.
 
Some Bonuses Eliminated
 Mr. Stempel said G.M. would not distribute an annual $600 bonus next year to salaried workers, except to some in foreign posts, the second consecutive year that the payment will not be paid in the United States.
Also, the stock-incentive program will be canceled for the year, Mr. Stempel said, and G.M.'s contribution to an employee savings plan will drop to 25 percent from 50 percent of the employee's annual deposit.
G.M. said it would try to cut staff through attrition, buyouts and early retirements. But Mr. Stempel said that he would not rule out a white- collar layoff. Hiring will be frozen in 1992, except for technical specialists. As the cuts take place, Mr. Stempel promised, "G.M. will become a much different corporation."
 
An Analyst's View
 But Ron Glantz, an automotive analyst with Dean Witter in San Francisco, said G.M.'s top executives were remiss in failing to cut or restructure their own ranks. "I think names should be taken," he said. The comment echoed the sentiment of many: that tens of thousands of G.M. workers, but few executives, pay a steep penalty for G.M.'s slide.
Individuals close to G.M.'s non-employee directors have asked Mr. Stempel to think about realigning top management. But Mr. Stempel, prefacing his news conference with the comment that top management "remains in place," later noted that the number of G.M. executives had dropped by one-third in recent years.
Today, G.M. disclosed the location of two plants whose workers already had received the bad news: Two plants in Lansing, Mich. that produce six-cylinder engines will be closed. G.M. has excess capacity at engine plants in Flint, Mich. and Tonawanda, N.Y., which could absorb additional production.
 
Parity in Productivity
 At one time, G.M. selected plants for closing based on their productivity or quality records. Mr. Stempel said the quality levels at most G.M. plants had improved to the point where they do not differ much now, so the company will consider how the closings will affect the employment of states and local communities before deciding which plants to close.
G.M. is expected to press plants for labor concessions in order to keep them open and save jobs. It has already been trying to negotiate adding a third work shift at some plants, in order to have almost non-stop assembly, for three crews of workers, Monday through Saturday. Only a few hours a day would be devoted to maintenance and repairs. G.M. has tried this plan in Europe and has found it successful.
Beyond operating more s efficiently, a big question is whether new G.M. car and truck models are meeting the expectations of their owners. Some models, like the redesigned 1992 Cadillac Seville, have shown signs of winning back younger, more affluent buyers that defected to imported brands. The Saturn models have attracted a high proportion of "import intenders," people who would have otherwise bought a foreign car
 
A Buick Cools
 Other models, like the full-size, rear-wheel-drive Chevrolet Caprice, seem better suited to another day and age, even though they were redesigned a few years ago. The Buick Park Avenue, a full-sized luxury sedan that won initial raves and strong sales, has cooled lately because Buick introduced a similar model, the LeSabre, that sells for far less money.
The cost of developing new models is soaring, and G.M. will have less money to spend. Mr. Stempel said capital spending for next year is being reduced by $1.1 billion, to $6.6 billion, or 14 percent. He said engineering budgets would be curtailed and operations consolidated.
Lloyd Reuss, G.M.'s president, who is in charge of the North American automotive business, said G.M. was finding ways "to get more for dollars spent."
 
Money-Saving Idea
 Mr. Stempel also took a step toward a money-saving idea that was first raised during last year's labor negotiations, and is used at Ford and Chrysler. He announced that a two-week shutdown of North American operations would occur in 1992 during the weeks of July 20 and 27.
He wants all employees to take vacations during those weeks; that time would be used at most plants to change tools for the new model year.
Previously, assembly workers who were laid off during tool changes collected unemployment benefits and could take vacation at other times.

"Highlights of the G.M. Plan"
Here are the major points of a plan to restructure the North American operations of General Motors Corp.:
 
PLANT CLOSINGS
The company said it will close six vehicle assembly plants, four powertrain plants and 11 component plants over the next few years.
Few details were released. G.M. said the assembly of large, rear-wheel-drive cars now done at plants in Arlington, Texas, and Ypsilanti, Mich., would be consolidated into one plant, but did not say which one.
One of its five plants that make midsize, front-wheel-drive cars also will be eliminated. The plants are in Oklahoma City; Oshawa, Ontario; Doraville, Ga.; Kansas City, Kan.; and Ramos Arizpe, Mexico.
Both consolidations will start next year.
 
JOB CUTS
G.M. will accelerate a white-collar job reduction program that began this year. It said 9,000 salaried jobs will be cut in 1992 through attrition and a new early-retirement program. Another 11,000 could be cut through consolidation in 1993 and 1994. The company plans no hiring in 1992 except for special situtions.
 
BONUSES AND OTHER COMPENSATION
G.M. will eliminate the $600 holiday bonus for salaried employees in 1992 for the second will eliminate stock-incentive compensation, except for some in international divisions. No U.S. profit-sharing payments will be made to employees.
 
CAPITAL SPENDING
Capital spending for next year will be reduced to $6.6 billion, down $1.1 billion from previous plans.
 
TOTAL SAVINGS
G.M. said it expects the plan will result in savings of $2 billion in 1992 and $5 billion a year by 1995. (Source: Associated Press) (pg. D4)

HEADLINE: U.S. AND ITS ALLIES TO MOVE ON LIBYA OVER AIR BOMBINGS

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 18

 BODY:
The United States, Britain and France have agreed to begin a campaign to win international support for sanctions against Libya for the part they say it played in the bombings of a Pan American World Airways plane over Scotland and of a French airliner in Africa, in which a total of 440 people were killed, officials of the three countries said today.
The three countries are considering a Security Council resolution that would at a minimum ban all international flights in and out of Libya, the sale of commercial planes and spare parts, and the delivery of any airline-related services. 
 "You'd have to take a bus to Cairo or a ferry to Malta to get out of Libya," one Administration official said. "The punishment would fit the crime."
 
Stricter Sanctions Discussed
 But the countries are also discussing more stringent sanctions, ranging from a ban on the sale of military equipment and civilian technology that could have military uses to a ban on Libyan oil exports.
The intention of the sanctions would be to force Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi to comply with specific demands made by the three countries, officials said. The demands include an American and British request for extradition of two Libyan intelligence agents who have been indicted in connection with the bombing of Pan Am's Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland three years ago Saturday and compensation for that attack. A total of 259 passengers on board the plane and 11 people on the ground were killed in the Pan Am bombing. French courts have also accused Libyan agents of the bombing of a Union de Transports Aeriens plane over Niger in September 1989 in which 170 people were killed.
International air-related sanctions would be more bothersome than economically crippling for Libya. Traffic in and out of Libya would have to go by either land or sea, and Libya would presumably have a difficult time maintaining its commercial aircraft. Libya has been the target of a variety of United States and European Community sanctions for years, and it is doubtful that new economic sanctions would change Colonel Qaddafi's behavior.
Officials of the three Governments said that while they have not ruled out military action against Libya as a last resort, their current strategy does not include any attempt to gain international support for a military strike.
The United States has already laid the groundwork for sanctions through its embassies. Immediately after the indictments of two Libyan intelligence agents by a Federal grand jury and by Britain on Nov. 14, the United States ordered ambassadors in every capital to present the evidence compiled for the indictments and make a general argument for punishing the regime of Colonel Qaddafi. Libya has since announced that the two men named in the indictment are under investigation and will be tried in Libya.
But American and British officials acknowledge the difficulty they face in trying to win sanctions against Libya, adding that they have not completely agreed on a joint strategy for accomplishing their goals.
One Administration official said that when the United States discussed the matter at "a very high level" with other permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, which include Britain and France along with China and the Soviet Union, there was "general agreement of a need to take action." But a Western diplomat involved in the discussions said that convincing China to go along with sanctions would be "an uphill battle."
The three Governments appear to be moving toward a step by step approach that mirrors the strategy used against Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. British officials said today that they expect to circulate a draft document at the United Nations before Christmas that echoes public demands made of Libya on Nov. 27, officials said.
In a joint statement on that day, the United States and Britain demanded that Libya promptly hand over the agents accused of taking part in the bombings, accept official responsibility for their actions, pay compensation for the bombing and furnish witnesses and evidence for the case. France joined its allies in a separate statement that did not list specific demands, but simply called on Libya to "comply with all these demands" and cease its support for international terrorism.
If there is sufficient support for a resolution, the three countries will present a formal resolution to the Security Council in January, after the expiration of the two-year term of Cuba and Yemen, two Council members likely to oppose any punitive measures against Libya. If Libya does not comply, a follow-up resolution seeking sanctions would be submitted.
The three countries may also seek sanctions through either the European Community or the Group of Seven industrialized countries, particularly if there is substantial resistance to the sanctions strategy in the Security Council. Although one Administration official called a mandatory Security Council resolution "the preferred course," Washington believes that both of the other groups may be more willing than certain Security Council members to impose stringent sanctions. The stricter sanctions could include a limit on diplomatic representation, a ban on oil sales and and a freeze on Libyan assets in foreign banks.
Although France has issued arrest warrants for suspects in the U.T.A. bombing, it has not asked for their extradition or for compensation.
To stave off the sanctions, Libya has proposed a number of concessions, including an offer to sever ties with all terrorist organizations and the creation of an international fact-finding tribunal to investigate the bombings. One Administration official called the overtures "hokey," but other officials said Libya's willingness to address the issue may persuade some Arab governments to oppose punitive measures.

HEADLINE: Connecticut to Sponsor Nursing-Home Insurance

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Dec. 18

 BODY:
Early next year an insurance company in Connecticut will sell the first long-term nursing-home insurance policy to be co-sponsored by a state government. The moment will push both the insurance industry and the state -- old allies in Connecticut and now full partners -- into a new frontier in the national policy debate over health care for the elderly. 
 State officials say the policies, which may be available in other states later next year based on the Connecticut model, will be far cheaper than existing private long-term-care insurance. In addition, policyholders will no longer have to go broke before Medicaid will pick up their bills.
But the initiative, which moved forward today when Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. announced the names of the first three companies signed to carry the new product, is also not without its critics. The powerful American Association of Retired Persons has blasted the plan as both wrong-headed policy and bad for consumers.
The hope is that by encouraging people to buy private insurance to pay for nursing home care -- care that now costs an average of about $50,000 a year in Connecticut -- the state can reduce over time the number of residents who need Medicaid, a joint state-Federal program that this year will drain nearly 9 percent of the entire state budget into the nursing home system.
Officials say the plan is aimed directly at middle-class residents who are too wealthy to qualify for Medicaid but too poor to pay their own way.
And it will help sell insurance, a fact that has not been overlooked by either critics or supporters here in what is unquestionably the closest thing to the nation's insurance capital. Giants like Aetna Life and Casualty, The Travelers Corporation, Phoenix Mutual and The Hartford dominate much of the local economy. In 1989, according to the most recent figures, the industry accounted for 14 percent of all nonfarm employment in Connecticut and 18 percent of the state's nonfarm gross product.
The originators of the partnership idea, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a private philanthropic group, said that when the first seed grants were issued in 1987, Connecticut was the only place in the country where the insurance business was already a major participant in statewide public policy planning.
That pre-existing relationship meant that Connecticut got the first grants, the first Federal approval from the Medicaid administration last summer and that its insurance regulators were also the first to write consumer guidelines that are now being duplicated more or less intact in Indiana and California. Both those states plan to begin selling state-sanctioned long-term care insurance next year, said Stephen A. Somers, an associate vice president at the Johnson Foundation.
 
'Marketing Advantage'
 But whether it follows that what is good for insurance and good for Connecticut is also good for the nation's health care policy is still not completely answered.
"The insurance companies are pushing it because it gives them a marketing advantage," said Phyllis Torda, director of health and social policy for Families U.S.A., a Washington-based health care advocacy group that has been highly critical of the Connecticut partnership plan. "The state got sucked in."
Ms. Torda, whose group favors a national health care solution, said that state-by-state partnerships of the public and industry could inhibit the momentum toward a national overhaul and that by focusing attention on the middle class, the truly needy people for whom Medicaid was set up might ultimately suffer, especially in the majority of states that allow nursing homes to give preference to non-Medicaid patients.
The American Association of Retired Persons, one of the nation's most powerful lobbying groups, says the Connecticut plan may simply be a bad deal for consumers.
With state budgets under severe stress in Connecticut and elsewhere, and a debate starting in Washington about the need for a large-scale overhaul, the association of retired people argues that a policy purchased today by a 65-year-old retiree may be worthless in 15 or 20 years when nursing home care is needed because the care system under which the policy was set up may no longer exist.
 
New York Proposal
 But the proposal, whatever its flaws, also addresses a number of needs. By allowing nursing home patients a way to avoid the humiliation of complete impoverishment -- either by transferring all their assets to their children or simply by paying the nursing home until one's life savings are gone -- supporters say that more people can grow old with their dignity intact.
And state officials here and elsewhere say that some way must be found to rein in nursing home costs in the 1990's. New York, for example, has applied for Federal authorization to allow an insurance plan under which a patient would buy nursing home coverage for a set period, say three years. After that time elapsed, the policyholder would automatically be eligible for Medicaid coverage, regardless of how much wealth he had.
Under the Connecticut plan, by contrast, a person could buy a set amount of insurance, say $50,000 worth. That policy would do two things: upon entering a nursing home, the policy would then begin paying out and would cover all expenses up to $50,000. After that, it would protect $50,000 of assets owned by the patient.
The insurance companies participating in the program are the Travelers, Blue Cross-Blue Shield of Connecticut and the Amax Life Assurance Company.
If the policyholder had greater wealth than $50,000, he would have to start paying for nursing-home care, but only to the point that his assets are reduced to $50,000, at which time Medicaid would take over.
The terms of the policies vary among the companies, but in general a $50,000 policy would cost about $80 a month for a healthy 65-year-old. The premiums would be lower for a younger person and would rise with age. Policies would not be sold to anyone with a pre-existing debilitating condition.
 
Subsidy Plan Dropped
 People over the age of 84 would also have difficulty buying coverage. The policies would be sold by insurance agents, not the state.
Advocates for the elderly say they fear that poor people will be afraid they need the insurance and that the state and the insurers will not be diligent enough in saying no, given the budget pressures from rising Medicaid costs.
"It's not clear where the line will be," said Judith Stein Hulin, co-director of the Center for Medicare Advocacy, a nonprofit legal advice and counseling center. "People who have clearly in their mind the worry of a nursing home stay are quick to plan for the future and to do without," she said. "If you're living on a low budget now, the added cost of a long-term-care policy could add to your impoverishment."


GRAPHIC: Cost: A 65-year-old person pays about $960 a year for a long term care policy covering $50,000 of nursing home expenses, about one year's worth on average in Connecticut.
Chart: "Nursing Home Insurance Plan"
 Coverage: When the policyholder becomes unable to live at home the policy covers exactly $50,000 of nursing home expenses.
 Extended Care: If expenses exceed the amount of coverage, the policy would shelter $50,000 of the patient's assets from the Federal Medicaid rules that otherwise require a person to be impoverished in order to get aid. A patient with more than $50,000 in assets would have to pay privately for nursing care, but only until $50,000 was left of his savings. (pg. B14)

HEADLINE: Joseph R. Smallwood Dies at 90; Led Newfoundland Into Canada

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO, Dec. 18

 BODY:
Joseph R. Smallwood, the politician credited by Canadians with leading Newfoundland and Labrador into the Canadian confederation in 1949, died on Tuesday night at his home outside St. John's, the Newfoundland capital. He was 90 years old.
He had been suffering from several ailments, including recurrent pneumonia, for several years. 
 Mr. Smallwood, known as Joey, was a salty figure who both infuriated and delighted Canadians with his efforts during 22 years as Newfoundland's Premier to extend the province's influence across the country.
Newfoundland, which with Labrador was a British colony, decided to join the Canadian confederation in a 1948 referendum by a narrow 7,000 vote margin. Mr. Smallwood led the campaign for joining Canada against opponents who favored an economic union with the United States or that Newfoundland declare its independence.
 
Known for Bluntness
 Rarely one to offer smooth comforts when blunt words would do, Mr. Smallwood made his mark by telling voters before the referendum that a rugged self-assurance born of centuries of hard-scrabble existence, mostly from fishing the rough seas of the Grand Banks, did not qualify them for independence.
"We are not a nation," he told the Newfoundlanders, many of whom are of Scottish and Irish descent. "We are a medium-sized municipality left far behind the march of time." Asked years later what would have become of Newfoundland if it had not joined Canada, Mr. Smallwood replied, "We'd be bankrupt and destitute."
The referendum ended nearly 400 years of British rule over the island of Newfoundland and the adjacent mainland territory of Labrador, which together became Canada's 10th and poorest province.
A diminutive figure with an unflagging energy and outspokenness, Mr. Smallwood blustered and pestered his way into the national consciousness, winning a share of Canada's bounty in federal projects and payments to Newfoundland that were often the envy of other provinces.
 
Legendary Stature
 Mr. Smallwood savored his designation as Canada's only living "father of Confederation," a label given to political leaders who founded Canada from four British colonies in 1867. But in tributes across Canada today, he was equally remembered for his dogged outspokenness and canny politics.
Those qualities gave him a legendary stature on "the Rock," as Newfoundlanders call the craggy, windswept island of 575,000 people that is North America's easternmost outpost.
One such tribute came from John Crosbie, Canada's Fisheries Minister, who was a political ally before leading a revolt inside Newfoundland's Liberal Party against what many regarded as Mr. Smallwood's idiosyncratic decision-making and taste for political intrigue. The rebellion led to Mr. Smallwood's ouster as the Newfoundland premier in 1972.
"I would say he would occupy the same place in our history as Sir John A. Macdonald," Mr. Crosbie said. referring to Canada's first Prime Minister. "He was a real one-man political band. It wasn't a question of dialogue or debate."
 
Began as Journalist
 Joseph Roberts Smallwood was born at Gambo, Newfoundland, on Dec. 24, 1900, the son of a sawmill owner. As a young man, he worked as a journalist in Newfoundland, reporting on the early trans-Atlantic flights for which Newfoundland was a staging post.
In the 1920's, he worked in New York for leftist newspapers and for the Progressive Party. Returning to Newfoundland, he worked as a union organizer and a broadcaster. During World War II, he became a pig farmer and supplied the Gander Air Force Base, a stopover point for American aircraft and troops being ferried to Europe.
As Newfoundland's Premier, he often described himself as a socialist and said that unfettered free enterprise resulted in "sheer, ghastly chaos." But his management of Newfoundland's financial affairs, including an early program of subsidized industrialization that led to widespread bankruptcies, was sharply criticized. But he was widely credited with being the moving force behind the giant Churchill Falls hydroelectric project in Labrador, one of Newfoundland's biggest sources of revenue.
In his last years he accumulated heavy personal debt with a project to write and publish a four-volume encyclopedia of Newfoundland, two volumes of which were completed in 1981 and 1984. A campaign was begun across Canada that raised money to help pay off the debts.

HEADLINE: Control Board Assails Dinkins 4-Year Fiscal Plan

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
Expanding on its earlier complaints, the State Financial Control Board issued a sharply critical report yesterday on Mayor David N. Dinkins long-term plan to balance the city's books, saying the administration's predictions about future tax revenues, debt and demands on welfare and the schools were unrealistic.
The City Budget Director, Philip R. Michael, insisted that the city's economic assumptions were sound. But he said the administration would take many of the board's criticisms to heart while revising the plan. 
 The report takes on special significance because the state's Municipal Assistance Corporation, led by Felix G. Rohatyn, has said it will not provide $1 billion in crucial aid unless the Dinkins administration can satisfy the board that it has a feasible plan to permanently shrink the government.
The Mayor and his deputies are to submit a revised four-year plan to the board in mid-January that they have vowed will meet the tests that Mr. Rohatyn and the board members have set forth. A heightened sense of expectation has surrounded the January plan because state fiscal monitors and bond-rating agencies have repeatedly questioned Mr. Dinkins's ability to bring the city's spending in line with its revenues.
 
Different Projections
 Promising that his January plan would allay the fears raised in the board's report, Mayor Dinkins said yesterday, "I'm confident we'll be able to satisfy all analysts and observers of our four-year plan."
The executive director of the control board, Allen J. Proctor, said state analysts believed the city would face larger budget shortfalls over the next five years than city analysts have projected. That is largely because state analysts do not believe the nation will crawl out of the recession as quickly as the city believes, nor that the recovery, when it comes, will ease the burden on the welfare system as much as city planners have hoped.
As a result, he said, the city is expected to face additional budget shortfalls of $333 million this year, $505 million next year and $694 million in fiscal 1994. In the two years after that, he said, the shortfalls are likely to be $913 million and $1.1 billion more than in the Mayor's plan.
Public-interest groups and bond-rating experts said the control board report would increase the already intense pressure on the Dinkins administration to draft a bolder plan before the January meeting.
"It illuminates what many people have been saying for several months," said Hyman C. Grossman, a managing director of Standard & Poor's. "That is that we need to see a plan that is a little more realistic than what we've seen so far."
"It's a gentle way of giving them some guidelines," Raymond D. Horton, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a private watchdog organization, said of the report.
Mayoral aides said Mr. Dinkins would be shown today the plans his agency heads have been drafting to flesh out the sketchy four-year plan the adminstration unveiled on Nov. 6, which was criticized by fiscal monitors for lacking specifics.
"I hardly think there is anything in the control board report that will be a fatal flaw to the plan we're working on," First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel said yesterday evening. "We believe these are essentially technical difficulties."

HEADLINE: Squeezed Networks Plan Radical Changes in Covering '92 Race

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER

 BODY:
Facing sharply reduced budgets and acknowledging that they made serious mistakes in 1988, the four national television news organizations, ABC, CBS, NBC and CNN, are planning radical changes in their coverage of the 1992 Presidential election campaign.
"You are going to see a zero-based approach to the coverage," said Tom Hannon, the political director of the Cable News Network. "Everything will be looked at in a brand new light." 
 The financial picture is so bleak at the four organizations that ABC and CBS may have their main newscaster stay home during the Republican National Convention, to be held in Houston from Aug. 17 to 20. It would be the first time since networks began broadcasting the event in 1948 that a network's main newscaster would not be at a political convention.
 
Flaws in '88 Coverage
 But the news executives said the changes were also a result of unhappiness with the quality of television coverage in the 1988 campaign.
"It's an interesting question as to whether the economic necessities are dovetailing with the lessons we may or may not have learned from 1988," Mr. Hannon said.
Specifically, he said: "There was way too much manipulation of television news in 1988. There was a far too narrow discussion of the issues, and television certainly played a major role in bringing that about."
Tim Russert, senior vice president of NBC News, said that four years ago, politicians felt: "Television is covering style not substance, so we'll deliver style. If they're not going to cover the campaign seriously, why should we be serious?"
Each television news organization says it hashas drawn up plans for more serious coverage of the 1992 campaign, including a new format for debates, more analytical reporting on issues and regular scrutiny of political commercials.
But, as Mr. Russert acknowledged, "scaling back costs" is at the heart of many of the revisions.
 
Fitting Plans to Budgets
 But the political director of ABC News said the emphasis on how cost-consciousness would affect the campaign coverage might be overstated. "We're all very aware of budgets and we certainly aren't going to waste any money," said Hal Bruno, the ABC official. "But there will not be one single thing we want to do that we won't be able to do."
A number of plans are specifically tied to reduced political news budgets.
For instance, the Republican National Convention may have to go gavel to gavel without the presence of Peter Jennings from ABC and Dan Rather from CBS. "We don't believe an anchorman has to be there to cover a coronation ceremony," said Joe Peyronnin, vice president of CBS News.
If they do not go to Houston, Mr. Jennings and Mr. Rather would anchor the coverage from New York. "I'm not going to say this wouldn't cost us less," Mr. Peyronnin said. "But we have been overwhelmingly overstaffed at previous conventions." The two newscasters will be at the Democratic National Convention, however, because the Democrats have a contest for the nomination and the gathering will be in New York, from July 13 to 17.
Tom Brokaw, NBC's main newscaster, will attend both conventions. He will appear on NBC as well as the Public Broadcasting System, which has made a deal to share convention coverage with NBC.
Because of increased competition and low ratings for the conventions, the three networks plan much more limited live coverage of convention activities than ever before. Unless something unexpected happens, each network will be cutting back on the number of hours of prime time that will be pre-empted for money-losing convention coverage and will devote more time to money-making entertainment programming. CNN and the public affairs cable channel C-SPAN will cover the conventions gavel to gavel.
But even before the first piece of bunting goes up at the convention sites, the networks plan to scale back coverage of the primaries.
 
Pooling of Information
 For instance, the networks for the first time plan to pool voter information on primary nights. A new organization called Voter Research and Surveys will supply to all four national television news organizations information gleaned from questions asked of voters leaving the polls. Until 1990, ABC, CBS and NBC did their own questioning of voters as well as offering projections of results. "We'll each save millions this year because of V.R.S.," Mr. Bruno said.
This move will cost CNN money, however, because it did not question voters leaving the polls in 1988. CNN, which spent only about $750,000 on election results in 1988, will pay about $4.5 million for the service next year.
Because of the high cost of travel, "star correspondents," as Mr. Russert called them, will rarely go on the campaign trail during the primaries. Instead, the networks will mainly have young producers or researchers follow the candidates every day. Both ABC and CBS experimented with this system in 1988 and said it worked well.
Network camera crews will supply almost none of the daily video footage of primary campaigning. Instead of the expensive four-person crews that used to travel with candidates, the networks may try to put together what Mr. Peyronnin called "ad hoc pool arrangements," in which the networks designate one crew to supply coverage for all four news organizations.
In addition, the networks plan to rely far more on crews and even reporters supplied by local affiliated stations, who Mr. Russert said "have gotten quite good in the major cities."
"I would trust those guys," he said.
C-SPAN is likely to become a bigger supplier for the networks. The channel covers the major daily activities of the candidates in its "video verite" style, with no reporter, just a video record of what the candidate does and says.
In the past, network news departments have made arrangements with C-SPAN to provide daily political coverage when they did not have crews at the scene. The network simply runs the tape and adds its own reporter's comments. Calling C-SPAN "God's gift to campaign coverage," Mr. Russert said, "The networks used to be the video record of the campaign; now C-SPAN has taken that role."
Steve Scully, the political editor of C-SPAN, said for the 1992 campaign the channel had doubled its 1988 political budget to $2 million.
Another possibility for replacing the expensive daily process of trailing after candidates is a proposed organization called the Election Satellite Network. Financed by a subscription fee charged to each network, it would provide crews and producers to cover every activity by every candidate
 
Networks' 'Insurance Policy'
 The service's executive producer, Jerry Lamprecht, called it "an insurance policy" for the news organizations if news broke and they were not there.
One lingering concern the networks have about cutting back on the candidates' movements is an event like the attempted assassination of George C. Wallace in 1972, which was captured by a CBS crew, the only one on the scene.
"This is the kind of thing they just can't afford to do anymore," Mr. Lamprecht said. The networks have yet to commit to Mr. Lamprecht's service but all said they were considering it.
One aspect of the coverage that would certainly not save the networks money is the new plan for four debates among the major candidates. The news organizations proposed the plan, which commits them to carrying three Presidential debates and one Vice Presidential debates, each one 90 minutes in prime time and without commercials .
The plan, which is still evolving, has the nominees meeting with a single moderator in an empty television studio. So far, it has not been endorsed by either party.
To supplant the ritual documentation of the candidates' campaign day, the networks say they will provide in-depth analytical reporting on the candidates and the issues. Mr. Hannon said CNN planned "investigative biographies" on each candidate.
Mr. Bruno of ABC said, "We're not going to let them get away again with just trying to declare who's the bigger patriot."
The networks now dismiss carefully chosen, scenic campaign appearances, which they can no longer afford to cover anyway, as meaningless "photo opportunities" and "video news releases." Mr. Russert said, "In 1988, by the time George Bush went to his third flag factory, we should have known something was up."
By staying in the studio, using limited videotape of the appearances and more well-researched information on the candidates' positions, the network executives said, the viewer will be better served -- at a much lower price.
Each news organization also said it has a plan to examine the claims made in political commercials. Mr. Bruno said: "We're all determined to hold the candidates responsible for what is said and promised in their names in those 30-second ads. You could call it a truth squad."
Sig Rogich, now assistant to the President and the director of advertising for President Bush's 1988 campaign, said he doubted that the coverage would substantially change in 1992, despite all the revised plans.
"You won't see that big a change ultimately," Mr. Rogich said. "The public still wants to see the candidates in the field, reacting to people. There is only so much analytical reporting you can do before the viewers start turning to another channel. One network is going to realize that and go out on the road with the candidates."
Over all, Mr. Peyronnin said, the number of hours of coverage of the campaign on CBS will probably be greater this year than in 1988, although many of those hours may come outside prime time.
Although Mr. Hannon of CNN suggested that the cutbacks in the coverage by the broadcast networks might be more noticeable than those executives were now willing to admit, he said: "There is a strong conviction on the part of news people to redress some of the problems we saw in 1988. It is a good thing to get away from the daily utterances of these guys at the flag factories. But nothing ever happens in a vacuum. Partly what you have here is a white-hat rationale for spending less on coverage."
Still, he added: "For a lot of reasons this is going to be a radically different political year. It may be better. We just have to wait and see."

HEADLINE: Seoul Says It Now Has No Nuclear Arms

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 18

 BODY:
In a move intended to increase pressure on North Korea to halt its nuclear weapons program, President Roh Tae Woo of South Korea announced on national television tonight that there were not now any nuclear weapons in his country.
"As I speak, there do not exist any nuclear weapons whatsoever, anywhere in the Republic of Korea," Mr. Roh said. 
 It was the first time in nearly four decades that a South Korean President could have made that statement. Although it has never been officially confirmed, the United States has kept more than 100 nuclear weapons at American bases in South Korea as part of its commitment to defend the Seoul Government.
 
Decision to Withdraw Weapons
 But after Western intelligence officials began reporting this year that North Korea is possibly only a year away from completing its first atomic bomb, South Korea and the United States decided to withdraw all American nuclear weapons. The decision, which was announced last month by Mr. Roh, satisfied one of North Korea's conditions for allowing international inspection of its nuclear research complex at Yongbyon, just north of Pyongyang.
Mr. Roh said that with his announcement tonight, and an earlier offer with the United States to permit North Korea to inspect any civilian or military site in the South in return for reciprocal rights in the North, the Communist Government in Pyongyang no longer had any reason to resist an agreement to halt its nuclear weapons program.
"North Korea must forthwith conclude and ratify a nuclear safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency, shut down all nuclear reprocessing and enrichment facilities and submit unconditionally to international inspection," Mr. Roh said.
But Pyongyang has also demanded that the Seoul Government renounce the protection of the United States nuclear umbrella, which can still be extended over South Korea from American bases elsewhere in the Pacific. The South has made no such commitment, and there was no immediate reaction from the North to Mr. Roh's comments tonight.
Mr. Roh's speech is the latest in a series of moves intended to bring the Koreas closer together, including an agreement last week pledging each nation not to attack the other and providing for economic exchanges, the re-establishment of communications links and the reuniting of families separated since the Korean War began in 1950. The nonaggression pact was the first step toward a full peace treaty since an armistice was signed 38 years ago.
But Mr. Roh warned today that none of the recently agreed upon steps could proceed until the North stopped trying to build a nuclear bomb.
"Obviously, we cannot successfully build peace and national reconciliation without first resolving the nuclear question," Mr. Roh said, according to a copy of his speech made available by the South Korean Government.
 
Soviet Subsidies Halted
 North Korea is believed to be eager to carry out the trade clauses of last week's accord. The Soviet Union has halted its subsidized deliveries of a range of goods, including oil, and because of its increasing diplomatic and economic isolation, North Korea has almost no hard currency with which to conduct normal trade or to purchase the raw materials and finished goods it needs to keep its economy afloat.
The South Koreans have dangled the prospect of a sharp increase in trade on easy terms as an inducement to North Korea to join international agreements.
In addition, the Japanese Government has said that if North Korea abandons its nuclear weapons ambitions, Tokyo may be willing to offer substantial financial aid and trade opportunities on concessionary terms.
The two Koreas have agreed to meet before the end of the year to begin negotiating a joint pledge to insure the Korean Peninsula will remain nuclear free.
What will happen if Pyongyang still resists is unclear. The United States has indicated it may take the matter up at the United Nations, and South Korean generals have periodically made remarks suggesting they would consider military strikes to destroy the nuclear facilities.

HEADLINE: Motor-Vehicle Employees Charged in Fake-ID Ring

BYLINE: By RONALD SULLIVAN

 BODY:
About 40 employees of the New York State Department of Motor Vehicles have been arrested and charged with selling at least 700 fake driver's licenses and other documents, many of them to illegal aliens, Federal authorities in Manhattan said yesterday.
The United States Attorney, Otto G. Obermaier, said that an 18-month investigation had smashed a loosely organized ring of state workers and others. In all, 57 people were charged with fraud, bribery and trafficking in false documents, including driver's licenses, registrations, learner's permits and other Department of Motor Vehicle documents. 
 Law-enforcement officials said the arrests constituted one of the biggest roundups of public employees on corruption charges in recent memory.
 
Raids and Searches
 In a series of raids, city police officers and investigators from the United States Attorney's office, the Bronx District Attorney's office, and the office of the Inspector General of the Department of Motor Vehicles descended on four motor vehicle offices in the city -- two in Manhattan, one in the Bronx and one in Brooklyn. At the same time, several suspects' homes or businesses were searched.
At the state motor vehicle branch office at 2265 East Tremont Avenue in the Bronx early yesterday morning, about 100 patrons were startled and some ducked for cover when nearly 20 law-enforcement officers wearing bulletproof vests and carrying shotguns swooped in and arrested eight employees.
All of the suspects were to be arraigned later before United States magistrate judges.
At a news conference, Mr. Obermaier said the investigation uncovered a large underground market in the city for false motor vehicle ID's. He said the network was based on the cooperation of corrupt motor vehicle employees and others in a loose-knit gang that "engaged in a systematic pattern of corrupt transactions."
Each ring member had a specific role. For instance, he said, some were "runners" who funneled bribes to state employees.
 
Cost: Up to $1,000
 Mr. Obermaier said individual ID's cost anywhere from $250 to $1,000. The purchasers included illegal aliens, scofflaws cited for motor-vehicle violations, convicted criminals seeking to change their identities, and others who could not get the documents legally.
The heavy demand for the ID's stemmed, he said, from the wide acceptance given to them by the police, department stores, banks, credit card companies and other institutions.
For example, the police rely on driver's licenses to determine identity, residence and criminal histories, while government agencies use them to trace public benefit payments.
The conspiracy, law-enforcement officials said, relied on motor vehicle employees who had access to computers, ID supplies, official documents and validating stamps. They said the employees also had to know how to circumvent internal controls and security measures.
Mr. Obermaier said the investigation involved the use of undercover police officers, informers, and videotape and audio surveillance.
 
Widespread Thefts
 Although Mr. Obermaier did not disclose what set off the investigation, other officials said it was in response to widespread thefts in every motor vehicle office in the city.
For example, a number of document-validating machines were stolen, and officials said false documents recovered by the police were traced to the stolen machines.
Thousands of blank driver's licenses and other documents were also stolen from the offices. Mr. Obermaier said more than 1,200 vehicle registrations were stolen from the Harlem branch in a single theft, and 232 blank driver's licenses were stolen from the Bronx.
In July 1990, the authorities said, about 900 vehicle registrations were stolen from the department office at 40 Centre Street in Manhattan.

HEADLINE: Debating Park Service Plan To Raze Ellis I. Buildings

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY

 BODY:
The buildings were there when the immigrants poured into Ellis Island in the early 1900's: the morgue and the crematory, the contagious-disease wards, the furnace and laundry. But do they have enough historic merit to save them from the wrecker's ball?
That was the dominant question at a 3 1/2-hour hearing Tuesday night on the National Park Service's plan to demolish 12 buildings to make room for a privately owned, $145 million conference center with 325 rooms for overnight guests. 
 Gerald Patten, the service's regional director, said 99.5 percent of the 12 million immigrants who passed through Ellis Island never saw these buildings on the southern half of the island. He argued that the crumbling structures account for only 10 percent of the building space on the island and are not critical to a full appreciation of its past. The past, he said, is best remembered in the exhibits in the island's refurbished Great Hall, the site of Tuesday's hearing.
"This building is substantial enough to tell all the stories of Ellis Island," Mr. Patten said. Speaking of the plan, he said, "I think care has been taken to minimize the impact on the island's historic fabric."
 
Site of the Nightmare
 The most poignant rejoinder came from Ken Fitch, a Manhattan writer, who said the joy most immigrants felt on Ellis Island was mixed with the dread felt by ailing immigrants that they would be deported.
"The southern half of the island -- unknown, unseen and hidden -- is the physicalization of that fear," Mr. Fitch said. "It is the place where the nightmare dwells. We cannot underestimate the power of a place to teach." Destroying the buildings destroys the memory of Ellis's most wretched residents, Mr. Fitch said.
About 40 people spoke at the hearing, and they were evenly divided on the plan.
Preservationists argued to save the 12 buildings, calling them critical to the full educational value of the island and a true interpretation of its past. A commercial venture, most of them said, was not appropriate in what they called a shrine to the nation's immigrant history and ethnic diversity.
Supporters called the conference center plan a boon to tourism and an opportunity to create new jobs and tax revenues. They said it would be ideal for international summit meetings and would bring new bustle to New York Harbor. In addition, they said, the island's 18 other decaying buildings would be rebuilt, their facades intact, as part of the conference center. And scientific and academic groups and the general public would be able to use the center on weekends and holidays and on summer days when corporate conferences ebb.
The Park Service's allies included two Democratic Congressmen, Charles B. Rangel of Manhattan and Frank Guarini of Jersey City; leaders of several labor unions, the American Institute of Architects, and various business groups, including the New York Hotel and Motel Trades Council and the Association for a Better New York.
In a statement read by an aide, Mr. Rangel said that he regretted the loss of the crematory, morgue and hospital wards, which he said "should not be denigrated."
"However," he added, "neither should they be so revered as to prevent rational, responsible, preservation-minded development that serves the public and national interests from moving forward."
A critic, J. Jackson Walter, president of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, said the ancestors of 40 percent of Americans came through Ellis Island. He questioned whether a private conference center conveyed the true significance of the island and whether Americans would be proud of it 50 years from today.
"Economics simply can't be what Ellis Island is all about," Mr. Walter said. "This place is authentic. That reality needs to be preserved." Mr. Walter called for a national debate on the issue.
Another critic, Clark Strickland, president of the Preservation League of New York State, appealed to Congress and the public to provide funds to preserve all 30 decaying buildings.
Mr. Patten, the Park Service official, said the agency has a $200 million capital budget, a backlog of $2 billion in rehabilitation and repair work at its parks and landmarks and, consequently, no money for Ellis Island.
For years, the service had insisted on using existing buildings for a conference center. But its developer, William Hubbard of New York City, was unable to raise the financing until International Conference Resorts of America of Scottsdale, Ariz., offered to put up the money if the 12 buildings were demolished.
After the hearing, Michael Adlerstein, the park service's regional chief of urban projects, said officials would meet with the historic preservation officers of New York State and New Jersey and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, which advises President Bush and Congress on proposed changes to national landmark property.
"We'll try to find an acceptable plan within the concept of an international conference center that satisfies concerns the public raised," Mr. Adlerstein said.
During the hearing, New York State's preservation officer, Orin Lehman, said the proposal "tramples on the evocative nature of the island." New Jersey, however, softened its past criticism of the plan. James Hall, New Jersey's deputy preservation officer, called it "reasonable" and urged that more hearings be held.

HEADLINE: 34.7 Million Lack Health Insurance, Studies Say; Number Is Highest Since '65

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 18

 BODY:
The number of Americans without any health insurance rose last year by 1.3 million, bringing the total number of uninsured to 34.7 million, the highest since the creation of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965, several health policy researchers reported today.
The increase occurred before the recent surge in layoffs because of the slumping economy, the researchers said, suggesting that the problem reflected long-term changes in the nation's health-care system. The recession and the sharp rise in unemployment in recent months have almost certainly contributed to a further rise in the number of uninsured Americans because many people lose health insurance when they lose their jobs. 
 The number of unemployed has risen by 1.9 million since June 1990, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Last month 8.5 million Americans were unemployed, the bureau said.
The new study, a tabulation and analysis of Census Bureau data from the March 1991 Current Population Survey, was done by the Center for National Health Program Studies at Harvard Medical School. The bureau has not published a report on health insurance this year. But in response to questions, Census Bureau economists confirmed today that the number of people reporting they had no health insurance rose by 1.3 million last year.
 
Reasons for the Increase
 Dr. David U. Himmelstein, a co-author of the Harvard report, suggested two reasons for the increase in the uninsured: health insurance premiums have risen sharply, making private coverage less affordable, and many private insurers now decline to write policies for individuals and groups f deemed to pose a high risk because of pre-existing medical problems.
The Health Insurance Association of America, a trade group for commercial health insurers, said today that the average monthly premium for a family increased to $318 in 1990, from $210 in 1987. Donald B. White, a spokesman for the group, said employers paid more than 70 percent of such premiums.
Many people who joined the ranks of the uninsured last year were relatively affluent. Families with annual incomes of $50,000 or more accounted for nearly one-third of the increase in the number of people with no health insurance, the Harvard researchers said. The number of such uninsured families with incomes of $50,000 or more rose by 431,000, to a total of 5.3 million in 1990.
Families with annual incomes of $25,000 or more accounted for nearly three-fourths of the increase in the number of uninsured, the study said.
 
A Salient Political Issue
 Data in the report suggest why health care has become a salient political issue. Democrats and Republicans alike say their middle-income constituents have expressed growing concern about the cost and availability of health care and health insurance. Private businesses in diverse industries and the American Medical Association have joined labor unions in prodding President Bush and Congress to take action.
Last month, in an election to fill the seat of the late Senator John Heinz, Republican of Pennsylvania, voters in that state rejected the Republican candidate, former Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, in favor of a Democrat, Harris Wofford, who supported national health insurance. Alarmed at those results, Mr. Bush said recently that he would offer comprehensive health-care proposals in his State of the Union Message next month.
The study issued today was written by Dr. Himmelstein, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard; Dr. Steffie Woolhandler, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard, and Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe, director of the Public Citizen Health Research Group, a consumer organization. All three support a national health insurance program to provide medical coverage to all Americans.
The number of people with private health insurance declined by 1.3 million last year, to 177 million, the study said.
Using data from other sources, Carl J. Schramm, president of the Health Insurance Association of America, estimated that the number of people with private health insurance protection declined by 5 million from 1980 to 1988. The nation's total population increased on the average by more than 2.2 million people a year in the 1980's.
"Health-care premiums reflect the price of health care, which has gone up at double-digit rates in recent years," Mr. Schramm said in an interview. "The rising cost of health care drives up premiums, so fewer and fewer businesses can afford health insurance. That's the primary reason five million people fell out of the private health insurance net. It's outrageous to blame health insurance companies for that development. We have to adjust our prices to reflect the underlying risk, the underlying cost of health care."
The number of people without any health insurance rose last year even though there was a big expansion of Medicaid, resulting from a new law that made benefits available to many pregnant women and children in low-income families. The number of people enrolled in Medicaid rose last year by 3.1 million, to 24.3 million, Dr. Himmelstein said.
The Harvard researchers used Census Bureau data to estimate the number of uninsured people in each state. The states with the lowest proportion of their populations uninsured were North Dakota, Wisconsin, Connecticut, Hawaii and Iowa. In each of those states, 6 percent to 8 percent of the people reported having no health insurance.
New Mexico, Texas, Mississippi, Louisiana and California had the highest proportions of their populations uninsured. In each of those states, 19 percent to 22 percent of the people said they had no health insurance.
Dr. Himmelstein said the number of uninsured people would have been much higher last year if the Medicaid program had not been expanded. "Without the expansion of Medicaid, the ranks of Americans without health insurance would have swelled by 4.4 million last year," he said.

HEADLINE: Bush Signs Transit Bill In Texas And Touts Jobs

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EULESS, Tex., Dec. 18

 BODY:
President Bush traveled 1,430 miles today to a muddy road-building site near Dallas in his latest effort to dramatize his eagerness to ease the "tough times" he now says the nation faces.
With television cameras rolling through a gray drizzle, Mr. Bush signed a $151 billion highways bill that he said would create or sustain 600,000 jobs in the current fiscal year. 
 The President watched approvingly as a roadworker, Arnold Martinez, introduced him with comments about layoffs in the industry and the "sometimes scary and financially difficult" nature of his work. Later, Mr. Bush donned a flag-emblazoned hard hat for a 20-minute inspection of earthmoving and paving machines.
 
Chicken-Fried Steak for Lunch
 Then the President loaded Mr. Martinez and six other workers picked out by the White House into his mud-spattered limousine and a van and the group was driven off to a roadside diner for a lunch of chicken-fried steak.
But at the same time, the fate of 3,800 jobs at a General Motors plant in nearby Arlington was thrown into question by an announcement that the company would consolidate operations there with those at a plant in Ypsilanti, Mich., and that one of the factories would be closed.
Today's appearance by Mr. Bush was the first since the White House abandoned its insistence that the economy was in a sluggish recovery and conceded that the recession that began in 1990 was continuing. Mr. Bush emphasized his anxiety about that whenever he found himself before a microphone or camera.
"Yes, there are layoffs and many families are having a rough go of it, and the American people want action," Mr. Bush said at the bill-signing ceremony. "And action is what they'll get. And I want every American to know that getting the economy back on track is my No. 1 priority."
Mr. Bush said twice today that his domestic priorities could be summed up in three words: "jobs, jobs, jobs."
Beyond today's roads bill, however, he offered no hint of other programs that he might favor to create those jobs or to otherwise spur the economy. Pressed to describe the growth package he plans to offer Congress next year, he said only: "We're going to have a big one."
The lunches, hard-hat tours and expressions of concern today reflect a recently mounted effort to depict Mr. Bush as someone who cares about the average American and his economic woes. The effort took shape about the time Mr. Bush replaced his chief of staff, John H. Sununu, with Samuel K. Skinner.
 
A New Strategy at Work
 Mr. Skinner, who helped run Mr. Bush's past presidential campaigns in Illinois, has said he plans to take the President outside Washington more often to see and hear the problems of ordinary Americans. He accompanied the President to today's ceremony, held beneath a largely finished expressway overpass near the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.
When the highways legislation that Mr. Bush applauded today was introduced in Congress, it was attacked by some of the President's his domestic policy advisers as "social engineering." Some conservatives oppose provisions that would channel more money to mass transit and high-technology projects like magnetically levitated trains, arguing that such systems often fail to support themselves.
But with the recovery from recession losing ground and unemployment growing by 240,000 workers last month alone, the highways bill has quickly become the tangible symbol of the Administration's economic policy.
In an afternoon speech at the airport to the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, the President said the 600,000 jobs that the highways bill would support this fiscal year is "just the start."
"Private projects funded with this money will generate even more work for Americans," he said. "A good transportation network will support jobs that wouldn't exist otherwise. That's the biggest benefit of this law."
The Administration estimates that $11 billion of the $151 billion authorized by the bill will be given to the states and spent immediately, creating or saving 600,000 jobs in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1.
Economists say the legislation should sustain about 900,000 jobs annually over its six-year life. That includes workers who are currently employed on highway jobs but who are facing layoffs, and workers who were recently left jobless when spending on Government projects trailed off at the end of the last fiscal year.
The bill funnels $21 billion in construction and repair money over six years to a new "national highway system" melded from the Federal Interstate network and a patchwork of other heavily traveled roads.
According to Marion Anderson of Employment Research Associates, a Lansing, Mich., consultant, every billion dollars spent on mass transit creates about 7,000 construction jobs and another 20,000 other jobs, like steelmaking, government work and operation of lunch wagons that feed workers.

Mrs. Bush Pays Filing Fee
 MANCHESTER, N.H., Dec. 18 (AP) -- Barbara Bush paid her husband's filing fee today for the Feb. 18 New Hampshire primary and took the opportunity to criticize Congress over the nation's economic woes.
In her visit to the statehouse in Concord, Mrs. Bush said, "Nobody suffers more than George over the economy," and added: "Congress ought to do something. I think they should stop moaning and whining and do something."

HEADLINE: States Slashed Aid to Poor in 1991, Report Says

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 18

 BODY:
Drastically paring emergency cash assistance and programs intended to avert homelessness, states slashed programs for the poor more sharply this year than in any year since the recession of the early 1980's, according to a study issued today.
In what they called the first comprehensive report on the subject, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and the Center for the Study of the States said 40 states froze or cut benefits under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program. 
 Of the 30 state general assistance programs, intended primarily for poor single people and childless couples, 14 were cut, affecting nearly a half-million people, or about a third of all recipients.
These cuts "are especially biting because they came during a recession when jobs are scarce and poor and unskilled people cannot easily find work," said Isaac Shapiro, a senior researcher with the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington policy research organization. The other author of the study, the Center for the Study of the States, is affiliated with the State University of New York at Albany.
The budget cuts together with the recession will result in increased homelessness in the nation, the report said. Compounding problems, many states combined cuts in assistance programs with increases in sales and other taxes that disproportionately affect the poor, it said.
Eleven states cut emergency payments intended to avert homelessness, and nine cut programs to help those already homeless, the report said. Four states cut benefits for the low-income elderly, blind or disabled, and 20 others froze the benefits. Over all, state programs to make housing more affordable were slashed 22 percent.
"These cuts concentrated on the poorest of the poor, in contrast to the cuts made in the beginning of the Reagan Administration, which targeted the working poor who had other means of income," said Robert Greenstein, director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, at a news conference.
The study said governors and legislatures relied too heavily on spending cuts and not enough on increasing income taxes, noting that programs for the poor in most states constitute 6 percent of the state budget.
Molly Hering, legislative director for the American Legislative Exchange Council, a bipartisan organization of state legislators, said, "In very recessionary, tough times, taxpayers are finding it extremely difficult to justify why they are paying for able-bodied single men and women to remain on benefits." She asserted that the cuts helped the poor by providing incentives to become self-reliant.
Ray Scheppach, executive director of the National Governors' Association, said cuts were made across the board and not just in programs for the poor.
 
More Cuts Are Seen
 States dealt with a combined $30 billion in budget deficits for the 1992 fiscal year, and with budget problems continuing, the poor could face a new round of deep cuts next year, the report said.
Michigan and Massachusetts made the deepest cuts, it said. Michigan, for example, halted general assistance and cut basic benefits in the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program, payments to the elderly, drug subsidies, food aid and emergency money when people are about to lose electricity or heat. Others that made deep cuts were California, the District of Columbia, Illinois, Maine, Maryland and Ohio.
This report is one of several released this week detailing what their authors characterized as governmental assaults on the poor. A report issued Monday by the United States Conference of Mayors on a survey of 28 cities said the demand for emergency food increased 26 percent and the demand for emergency shelter grew 13 percent this year. A report Tuesday by the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty examined what it called "the recent spate of anti-homeless ordinances."

HEADLINE: Trump and USAir Deal Seen Near

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
USAir is close to signing an agreement to take over the running of the Trump shuttle, with an option to buy it after five years, two executives close to the talks said yesterday. In return, Donald J. Trump would no longer be held personally responsible for more than $300 million of the shuttle's debt.
But the executives, who insisted on anonymity, differed on the timing, with one saying it could be a matter of days and the other saying the move could occur in a week or more. 
 One executive said the banks, which have been trying to come to terms with Mr. Trump on his various debts, agreed to the deal because they felt USAir would pay more for the shuttle at the end of five years than the $360 million Mr. Trump paid Eastern Airlines to acquire it in 1989.
Representatives of USAir could not be reached for comment.
 
No Letter, Banker Says
 The banks, led by Citicorp, have suspended the shuttle's interest payments.
One executive, a banker, said last night that no letter of intent had been signed but that USAir was in talks about a deal. The banker said Mr. Trump would no longer be liable for $100 million of the shuttle's debts, though he would still owe $35 million.
It could not be determined yesterday why the executives differed so widely on the extent of Mr. Trump's personal debt in the deal.
The New York developer borrowed the money to buy the shuttle on the basis of his ability to repay the bank loans. At that time, his financial empire was still doing well.
One executive said that other airlines, including American and United, were interested in acquiring the Trump shuttle but that USAir had been the most aggressive.
 
Antitrust Concerns
 For USAir, the advantage of not buying the shuttle outright is that it does not have to put up a lot of cash immediately and that it may be in a better position to overcome antitrust concerns by arguing that it now holds only a minority stake.
USAir, based in Arlington, Va., is a leading carrier at La Guardia Airport in New York, National Airport in Washington and Logan International Airport in Boston, all of which are linked by the shuttle's hourly flights.
Thus the purchase, which is subject to approval by the Transportation Department, could raise antitrust questions, although the agency has approved several takeovers that have been opposed by the Justice Department as anti-competitive.
Under the agreement, for five years USAir would operate the shuttle with a small owernship stake. The carrier is likely to buy the shuttle afterward, since the landing slots the shuttle controls at La Guardia and at other airports are difficult to get.
Large airlines have often been hampered in expanding at these airports because they cannot get landing and takeoff slots at peak periods. The Trump shuttle would also help feed USAir's flights, which are heavily concentrated on the East Coast.
When Mr. Trump bought the shuttle from Eastern in July 1989, he called it the addition of another jewel to his empire, equaling it to his acquisition of the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan. But a bitter strike at Eastern had cut the shuttle's market share to less than 20 percent, and Mr. Trump and his managers had a tough time winning travelers back from the Pan Am Shuttle, which has since been bought by Delta Air Lines.
 
Fighting to Regain Share
 Eventually, the Trump shuttle, helped by a refurbishment of its old fleet of Boeing 727's, as well as its terminals, fought back to about achieve a 50 percent share, but it has been unable to attain the more than the 60 percent share that produced high profits in the Eastern days.
Under Mr. Trump, the shuttle lost money most of the time, and its losses deepened during the Persian Gulf war, when fuel prices doubled and traffic plummeted.
Mr. Trump said in a recent interview that the shuttle had since recovered and was producing an operating profit. But airline analysts have held that two shuttles operating in the same market were too much and that neither could show solid profits until one succumbed.
Unlike for Mr. Trump, who has no other airline operations, the shuttle will be important for USAir, beyond being an asset that produces profits. It would be a strategic acquisition that would greatly strenghten the troubled carrier in some of the nation's largest and lucrative markets.
USAir has had heavy operating losses because of the traffic drop from the recession and high labor costs. The carrier has also been hampered by having too many fights in similar markets after it acquired Piedmont Airlines in 1987.
Delta, based in Atlanta, has a reputation for emphasizing service, so the competitive pressure on the Trump shuttle is expected to increase.
 
New Managers Expected
 On Oct. 1, Mr. Trump appointed a new president of the shuttle, Terry Hallcom, who had been the director of flight operations and an Eastern pilot for 22 years.
USAir is expected to named its own management team.
It could not be determined yesterday whether Mr. Trump lost money on the transaction, but the other executive close to the talks said yesterday that neither the banks nor Mr. Trump would lose money if USAir bought the shuttle.

HEADLINE: Stocks Prices Mixed as Dow Gains 5.81

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stocks closed mixed yesterday as blue-chip issues rallied after some early weakness to finish slightly higher. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 5.81 points, to 2,908.09, while some indexes posted small losses.
Investor concern over the economy continued to hound the market, as well as disappointment with the Federal Reserve's delay in lowering interest rates. Some traders said the General Motors Corporation's announced restructuring could be interpreted as good news, while others said it simply underlined the economy's weakness. 
 Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was heavy at 193.5 million shares, up from 191.7 million on Tuesday. Losing issues led gainers at 891 to 740.
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 0.74 points, to 383.48, while the Big Board composite moved up 0.23 points, to 211.44. Trading on the American Stock Exchange pushed that index down 1.09 points, to 368.72.
The Nasdaq composite rose 0.14 points, to 593.84, while the Russell 2,000, a barometer of smaller stocks, slipped 0.29 points, to end at 177.37.
Blue-chip issues fell at the opening over disappointment in the Fed's delay in moving toward another rate cut. The decline also reflected some followthrough from Tuesday's late selloff. In addition, a soft bond market and some selling by investors closing portfolios for the year also exerted pressure on stocks.
Weighing on the market was the testimony by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, to the House Ways and Means Committee, where he said the United States business upturn "clearly has faltered."
Gene J. Seagle, research director at Gruntal & Company, said, "Greenspan's statement to the House Ways and Means Committee and soon-to-be-released Administration plan to stimulate a laggard economy have both buyers and sellers waiting to see which way the ax will fall."
But, he added: "History tells us to expect a year-end rally. Since World War II, the average gain from that rally has run to almost 10 percent."
Mr. Seagle said he sees an increased amount of cash on the sidelines that has been building up, with an unusually large accumulation in money funds, almost $500 billion that is receiving low rates of return.
In the market yesterday, BET Holdings, parent company for the cable network Black Entertainment Television, requested that trading be halted in its stock at about 1 P.M. so the company could clarify an "apparent misunderstanding" on subscriber levels. The stock, which last traded at 15 7/8, off 3, did not resume trading for the remainder of the day. The misunderstanding stems from a difference between the number of subscribers the company says it has and the number A. C. Nielsen says it has.
Based on the stock price appreciation of International Flavors and Fragrances, an analyst at Paine Webber, Kimberly Ritrievi, lowered her rating to "attractive" from "buy." She said, "I think there's a 20 percent upside, but it's not the screaming buy it was." The stock rose 1/4, to 96 5/8.
Another company whose rating was changed because of its stock price was Advanced Micro Devices, as analyst Thomas Kurlak of Merrill Lynch downgraded the company's intermediate term rating to "neutral" from "above average," traders said. The stock fell as much as 7/8, closing down 1/2, to 15 yesterday.
Digital Equipment said yesterday that it sees a second-quarter operating loss because of a weak worldwide economy. It also said competitive pressures had resulted in reduced demand for larger computer systems and, in addition, several new products have not yet been shipped. The stock, down as much as 6 1/8 early in the day, closed off 4 3/4, to 51 3/4.
Following a secondary offering of 2 million shares at $42 a share, Office Depot, which sells office supplies, fell 1 1/2, to finish the day at 42 1/2.

HEADLINE: Record Year In Bond Issues

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
American companies issued a record $464.4 billion in corporate bonds this year, encouraged by falling interest rates to raise fresh capital, IDD Information Services said yesterday.
The total far exceeds last year's record of $283.7 billion, said IDD, an economic research firm. 
 The leading underwriter for corporate bonds in 1991 was Merrill Lynch & Company, which managed 952 new deals worth $77 billion. Following Merrill were Goldman, Sachs & Company and Lehman Brothers, which each managed $55 billion in deals.
Merrill also ranked first among underwriters of new equity, including stock, with 1,067 deals worth $93.2 billion.
IDD said that each deal, on average, generated a fee of $1.1 million, or 0.24 percent of the total value.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Bleak About Economy But Warns Against a 'Quick Fix'

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 18

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, gave Congress a bleak assessment of the economy today, but he suggested that the bad times would be over by Election Day and cautioned against a "quick fix" like a tax cut.
"The economy is struggling," Mr. Greenspan said, because the nation is feeling the hangover from rampant speculation and increased debt in the 1980's. He said he was especially struck by a deep-seated concern among Americans that they will not live as well as previous generations. 
But this "does not necessarily mean that a prolonged period of economic weakness is inevitable," he told the House Ways and Means Committee. Responding to questions from panel members, he said the kinds of tax cuts now being considered by the White House and Congress would probably be counterproductive.
Mr. Greenspan acknowledged that he might have underestimated the intractability of the recession earlier this year, but his basic advice now to Congress was to sit tight.
Mr. Greenspan ended three hours of testimony by saying, "I would be very doubtful that any short-term fiscal stimulus which could engender significant consumption at this stage would be sufficiently long-lasting to put us on a new long-term growth path."
 
Danger From the Deficit
 Mr. Greenspan's comments today repeatedly emphasized the danger of tax cuts or spending increases that might magnify the deficit. In other recent comments, the Federal Reserve chairman has said fiscal measures of some sort may help revive the economy, although he stressed that any such steps would have to avoid enlarging the deficit. Without giving particulars, he had said such a package was conceivable.
The financial markets are expecting the Federal Reserve to cut key interest rates again any day now, and today's testimony did not seem to have much effect on trading. Although Mr. Greenspan would not tip his hand, he said nothing to counter the expectation that additional easing of rates was in the offing. In answer to a question from the committee chairman, Representative Dan Rostenkowski, Democrat of Illinois, Mr. Greenspan said, "Obviously, we are looking at the situation exceptionally closely, and should in our judgment further action be required, you can expect us to do so."
The Federal Reserve chairman is highly respected in Congress, even among Democrats, and if he had recommended a fiscal stimulus, enactment would have been a foregone conclusion. But his advice against a tax cut that would increase the budget deficit might not have been sufficient to dissuade the politicians, who are under severe pressure at the outset of an election year to try to give the economy a quick jolt.
 
Relief for the Middle Class
 The White House is considering a variety of tax proposals, including one that would give taxpayers a rebate of up to some $300 on their taxes due April 15. Dozens of measures have been introduced in Congress, many of them to provide tax relief to middle-income taxpayers.
Mr. Rostenkowski, the dominant voice in Congress on tax matters, described the conflict in which the lawmakers find themselves: "We are being asked by our constituents to solve their economic problems, and we are being told by many experts that we should promote the long-run health of our economy."
Because the Federal Reserve has considerable control over short-term interest rates, Mr. Greenspan has more influence over the economy and bears more responsibility for its state than any other public official.
For the first time publicly, he suggested today that he might have miscalculated the nature of the recession earlier this year and implied that perhaps the Fed should have reduced rates last spring and summer when it was holding the line.
 
Rare Opportunity for Questions
 Unlike most other important officials, Mr. Greenspan rarely holds on-the-record interviews or answers questions from audiences after his speeches. So almost the only time he is subjected to public questioning is when he testifies before Congress.
His most recent previous testimony, in July, was unusually optimistic. "We are well on the path," he said then, "of actually achieving the type of goals which we've set out to achieve: a solid economic recovery with the unemployment rate moving down to its lowest sustainable, long-term rate, with growth at or close to its maximum long-term sustainable pace."
In line with that assessment, the Fed, which had been cutting interest rates more or less regularly since the summer of 1989 to try to thwart a serious recession, held rates constant from April to August of this year.
In retrospect now, he said, it is clear that as a result of the corporate mergers and buyouts, the overbuilding of commercial real estate and the household spending boom of the 1980's, much of it financed by debt, "the nation's balance sheet has been severely stretched."
 
Deciding to Trim Debts
 "By late summer," he continued, "the growing propensity of households to pare debt and businesses to reduce leverage was a signal that the balance sheet restraints, feared by many for a long time, had indeed taken hold, working against the normal forces of economic growth."
That is as close as Mr. Greenspan ever comes to admitting an error of judgment, although he said later in the hearing, "I am not sure there is any way that I know of analytically that we could have forecast that in advance."
Mr. Greenspan's economic assessment was not all gloomy. "There is a healing process going on," he told one questioner. "My best judgment at this stage is that what we are looking at is a pause, a different type of pause than we've seen in past recoveries, but a pause, nevertheless, in an economy which over all is in the process of recovering."
Asked then how long the process might take, he said, "This is a far shorter problem than a year."
 
Only One Tax to Cut
 Mr. Greenspan reiterated his long-standing support for a reduction in the capital gains tax and said other tax cuts to generate more business investment might be worthwhile as long as taxes were increased elsewhere or spending was cut to prevent adding to the deficit.
The Government's only policy position that would truly make a difference in economic growth, he said, was a reduction in the deficit. "It's only by removing the drain of Treasury borrowings from the capital market that the advantages of expanded savings and investment can be truly achieved," he declared.
Representative J. J. Pickle, a Texas Democrat, replied: "That's a statement of principle, but that's not likely to be achieved right now with respect to our immediate problems. In the land of the Wizard of Oz, that might come about, but not now."

HEADLINE: Tug-of-War Over G.M. Plant Closing

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ARLINGTON, Tex., Dec. 18

 BODY:
By not announcing which of two big-car assembly plants here and in Ypsilanti, Mich., it would close, the General Motors Corporation today put the lives of 3,400 workers here in limbo.
In saying only that the company intends to close in the next few years 21 assembly, engine and parts plants, Robert C. Stempel, chairman and chief executive of the No. 1 auto maker, set off a likely tug-of-war between the company, the union and local politicians as a decision is reached on which plants should be closed. 
 "That work is still ahead of us," Mr. Stemple said, predicting that the transition would occur next year.
But one thing is clear in this suburban city east of Fort Worth: Only one plant -- either the one here or the Ypsilanti plant, known as Willow Run, near Ann Arbor -- will be closed in the biggest retrenchment ever for General Motors.
At the Arlington plant, some workers challenged Mr. Stempel's promise that the plants would not be played off against each another to force the deepest possible concessions. But most workers boasted of their productivity.
"Dealers will tell you they'd rather have an Arlington car than a Willow Run car," said Annette Morrow, a seat builder and trimmer who has worked 15 years for G.M. "Willow Run labor is too militant and they have more salaried people there than we do," she said, referring to the Michigan plant.
Both plants build big cars, like the Chevrolet Caprice and the Buick Roadmaster. The decision on which to close will come down to which plant can make a better case for cutting costs and improving G.M.'s poor efficiency record so that the maker's cars can be priced more competitively.
The Michigan plant has lower costs for parts shipments, especially heavy engines and transmissions, compared with the Texas site because of its location near the heart of America's auto-making nerve center and G.M.'s North American supplier network. Yet the Texas plant is closer to suppliers of smaller parts, like wiring harnesses, door assemblies and body trim made in northern Mexico.
Arlington workers and executives once bragged that the quality of their work was one of the highest of any plant in the G.M. empire, but Mr. Stempel said today that that was no longer an issue. "The differences are so slight" now in quality levels among all G.M. plants, he said.
Workers at the G.M. plant here were told last week by their manager, Art Hester, and a senior union official, Mike Seiler, not to expect a decision today from Mr. Stempel. Many were stunned and angered by a report today in The Detroit Free Press that the decision to close the Arlington plant had already been made.
But after Mr. Stempel's remarks to reporters, many renewed their hopes that their plant would prevail in a competition with Willow Run.
 
Action by Union
 G.M.'s announcement today came as members of United Automobile Workers union Local 276 here voted to give their leaders a virtual blank check to bargain for whatever terms are needed to keep the Arlington plant in business.
"We need a good vote on this to give us the teeth to go in and negotiate," said Dave Perdue, president of the U.A.W. local. "I feel like we'll win."
One proposal outlined by the union was to add a third shift at the plant by moving to a four-day workweek of 10-hour shifts for its members. Current shifts are eight hours, five days a week. The change could open jobs for workers transferred from the Michigan plant, Mr. Perdue said.
Mr. Perdue said the union was not pressured into the concession by Mr. Hester. "He just lays the situation out on the table, and it's up to us to make some decisions," he said.
Walter Mays, 45, said the schedule change would help overcome the Arlington plant's smaller production capacity and higher freight costs compared with Willow Run's.
 
Making a Case
 The workers were told last week that Arlington managers would make their case before G.M. executives in Detroit during the week of Jan. 8, with Willow Run to follow a week later. A decision is expected before Feb. 1.
Mr. Mays was among those who were skeptical about Mr. Stempel's promise that the two plants were not being "whipsawed," as he put it.
"I've seen this before," Mr. Mays said of the schedule changes that his union leaders had endorsed. "Six years ago, we were told to vote in the team concept, or the plant would close," he said, referring to a way of reorganizing the work force. "We did, by 86 percent. Willow Run didn't, but they stayed open. I think it's another game to see what they can get. Their decision, whatever it is, has already been made."
 
Another Blow
 A shutdown of the sprawling, 38-year-old plant here would be yet another blow for the economy of the Fort Worth region, which, with one-third the population of Dallas, has been battered by plant closings and job cutbacks all year.
Just over a year ago, the Fort Worth area had one of the lowest jobless rates in Texas, at 4.4 percent. But jarring cutbacks in Pentagon budgets, which had an impact on a General Dynamics plant here; a slumping local economy, and rising manufacturing layoffs pushed unemployment to 7.2 percent in October.
The Pentagon canceled development of the Navy A-12 attack plane in January. And last summer it said that 7,000 jobs would be lost when the nearby Carswell Air Force Base, home to aging B-52 bombers, would be closed.
Those cutbacks knocked nearly 5 percent from the Fort Worth-Arlington economic base, and the loss of the G.M. plant "would blow away another point and a half," said Don C. Reynolds, a Fort Worth economist and former head of the county's economic development commission.
Bernard L. Weinstein, another local economist, said the General Motors plant, with a 1990 payroll of $121.5 million and hourly wages ranging between $15 and $25, contributes between $400 million and $500 million in purchasing power to the local economy.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Fed Chief's Testimony

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the testimony of Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, before the House Ways and Means Committee yesterday.
The upturn in business activity that began earlier this year clearly has faltered. It is apparent that the economy is struggling and that there have been some strong forces working against moderate cyclical revival. 
 Now that we are well past the period of gyrations associated with the crisis in the Persian Gulf, we can better gauge the strength of the underlying disinflationary forces that were active well before the economy tilted into recession in the autumn of 1990.
During the 1980's, large stocks of physical assets were amassed in a number of sectors, largely financed by huge increases in indebtedness.

 	 	 		. . .	 	The bottom line . . . is that the national balance sheet has been severely stretched. While most analysts of course were aware of the increasingly disturbing trends of rising debt and elevated corporate leverage, it was not clear that these burdens had as yet reached a magnitude that would restrain the American economy from a moderate cyclical recovery in 1991.

 	 	 		. . .	 	By late summer, however, with half the recession losses recovered, it became clear that the cumulative upward momentum that characterized previous recoveries was absent. The growing propensity of households to pare debt and businesses to reduce leverage was a signal that the balance sheet restraints feared by many for a long time had indeed taken hold, working against the normal forces of economic growth.
These events do not necessarily mean that a prolonged period of economic weakness is inevitable, but they do mean that policy makers must consider these unusual forces when shaping their response in the current situation.
It is essential that the direction of public policy be well targeted to the nature of the problem it is seeking to ameliorate. . . . But only in the context of prudent, noninflationary expansion of money and credit are such improvements likely to be lasting.
In concept, private balance sheet liquification also could be facilitated by tax cuts for individuals or corporations if they are largely saved by the recipients. In effect, public debt would displace private debt on our nation's balance sheet.
But if the markets were to perceive such policy initiatives as undermining long-term fiscal discipline, long-term interest rates would rise and debt service burdens again would mount. . . . Congress should approach with great caution any proposal that would expand the structural budget deficit. At a minimum, care should be taken to insure that any short-run stimulative action does not imply a widening of the deficit over the longer term. 

 	 	 		. ..	 	Consumers appear to be more apprehensive than one might expect given the broad macroeconomic circumstances. For example, the level of employment and particularly the layoff rate are well below those experienced in periods of economic weakness. This would not seem to square with the deep concerns expressed in surveys about perceived labor market conditions.
It is true that homeowners sense some contraction, however small, in the market value of their most important asset, the equity in their homes. But it is surely no worse a concern today than it was in the spring. If anything, the data on home prices suggests it should be less so.
I suspect that what concerns consumers and indeed everyone is that the current pause may be underscoring a retardation in long-term growth and living standards. So long as the recovery proceeded, this latent concern did not surface. But as balance sheet constraints held the recovery in check, earlier worries about whether the current generation will live as well as previous ones resurfaced.
Such anticipation certainly need not be realized if we follow appropriate policies, and this suggests strongly that any current policy initiatives should focus on some key fundamentals. Indeed, firm reliance on policies directed toward longer-term stability and incentives are likely to do as much or more for short-term economic expansion as a so-called quick fix.
. . . the essential shortcomings of this economy is the lack of saving and investment. It's here that our major policy focus should rest. Investment is the key to enhanced productivity and higher living standards. 

 	 	 		. . .	 	As I have argued previously before this committee, a reduction in the capital gains tax would be quite helpful. It is especially important considering our current difficulties with weak real estate property values. A capital gains tax cut would buoy property values, which would alleviate, in part, the collateral shortfalls that plague our financial institutions. . . . How far and how fast we can move towards a tax structure more conducive to capital formation is ultimately a political decision. 

 	 	 		. . .	 	Traditional fiscal stimulus might provide a temporary boost to aggregate demand, but if you accept the view that it is the concern of the American people for our long-term future that is at the root of our current problem, then other instruments of policy might well be more effective.
Market forces are already addressing our stretched balance sheets. Record issuance of equity in our capital markets recently is contributing to de-leveraging, and large bond issues are funding short-term debt, and removing some of that strain.
Finally, lower interest rates, as I indicated earlier, are lowering the debt-service burden. Mr. Chairman, we have made a good deal of progress in the balance-sheet adjustment process, and the payoff in the form of an easing of unusual restraint should begin to become evident in the reasonably near future.

HEADLINE: Business Plans to Raise Capital Outlays by 5.4%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 18

 BODY:
Businesses, after cutting plant and equipment spending in 1991 for the first time in five years, plan to increase investments by 5.4 percent next year, the Government said today.
Still, the increase would be less than half of the double-digit advances posted before the recession, and analysts said the report reflected anxiety over whether the economy could manage a sustained recovery. 
 "Normally in a recovery period, capital spending can be extremely brisk," said Gilbert Benz, an economist at the Swiss Bank Corporation in New York. The spending plans reported today are "a reflection that people are not expecting any real robust turnaround, even in late '92."
A Commerce Department survey in October and November found that businesses plan to spend $558.6 billion, which would be a record, for expansion and modernization in 1992, up from $530 billion projected for this year.
 
First Cut Since 1986
 But the survey found businesses were reducing their investments this year by five-tenths of 1 percent, the first decline since a 2.6 percent cut in 1986.
"The drop in '91 reflects what's now commonly thought to be an absence of any growth in the second half of the year," Mr. Benz said.
The new survey reversed a finding last summer, after the economy perked up a bit, that companies planned to increase spending by five-tenths of 1 percent this year. Spending in 1991 had been projected to rise 2.7 percent in a spring survey, 2.5 percent last winter and 2.4 percent a year ago.
The record for capital spending is $532.6 billion in 1990, although that reflected just a 5 percent increase as the economy entered the recession. Capital spending had advanced 11.4 percent in 1989 and 11 percent in 1988.
 
After Adjustment for Inflation
 The figures are not adjusted for inflation. When adjusted, 1992 spending plans rose 5.7 percent, to $521 billion. That compares with a decrease of 1.1 percent, to $492.8 billion, planned for 1991.
Slack demand has curbed much of the need for new plants and equipment. In fact, the Federal Reserve has said the nation's factories, mines and utilities used only 79.1 percent of their capacity in November.
At the same time, the recession has depleted the funds that businesses have for investment. The Commerce Department reported earlier that current-production cash flow -- the funds available for investment -- fell six-tenths of 1 percent in the third quarter after inching up just three-tenths of 1 percent in the second quarter.
The survey found utilities and companies engaged in mining, transportation and other nonmanufacturing businesses planned an 8.4 percent increase in capital spending to $374.5 billion.
Manufacturing companies, however, projected a one-tenth of 1 percent reduction to $184.1 billion.
The projection includes a 3 percent increase for industries making durable goods -- items like motor vehicles and machinery that are expected to last at least three years. But that was offset by a 2.4 percent decline in the production of nondurables, like food and clothing.

HEADLINE: Digital Forecasts Quarterly Operating Loss

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, Dec. 18

 BODY:
The Digital Equipment Corporation told analysts today that it was facing a probable operating loss for its second fiscal quarter ending Dec. 28. After the announcement, the computer company's stock plunged $4.75 to close at $51.75 on the Big Board.
While Digital did not say how much it expected to lose, analysts' estimates ranged from $18 million to $75 million. 
 Mark A. Steinkrauss, a Digital spokesman, said the loss resulted principally from reduced demand for larger computer systems like Digital's VAX 6000 and VAX 9000 lines because of the weak economy and competitive pressures. The loss would mark the first quarterly loss not related to a restructuring charge in Digital's 34-year history.
 
'Just Not Buying'
 Mr. Steinkrauss said the downturn was being felt in all Digital's global markets. "We're not losing business to other vendors," he said. "People are just not buying." Mr. Steinkrauss said that the company was considering more layoffs and plant closings but added that nothing would be announced until Jan. 16, when the quarterly numbers are handed out.
Digital, based in Maynard, Mass., has laid off 1,500 employees this quarter and plans to lay off 4,000 to 5,000 more in the second half of its fiscal year.
Marc Schulman, an analyst with UBS Securities, attributed the expected loss to the combined effect of the poor economy, a significant product-cycle transition for Digital and rumors that an impending investment tax credit would go into effect on Jan. 1.
"A customer has nothing to lose by waiting until Jan. 1 to buy new computers," Mr. Schulman said. "If you can get an investment tax credit that reduces the cost considerably, it is worth waiting." Mr. Schulman is now estimating the quarterly loss will be equal to 60 cents a share.
Digital has revamped nearly its entire product line and announced a large number of new computers since Oct. 30. The new products, which met with favorable reaction from customers and analysts, have not been shipped in volume as Digital gears up its manufacturing process. Mr. Steinkrauss said the new computers would be shipped in volume by March, as planned.
John B. Jones Jr. an analyst with Montgomery Securities, said the anticipated operating loss, which excludes interest earned from Digital's $2 billion in cash reserves, was not unexpected. He said he had forecast net earnings of 25 cents to 30 cents a share for the quarter, but a number of analysts had Digital's net at a break-even point, which would have pointed to a loss from operations.
For the comparable quarter a year ago, Digital reported a net profit of $155.4 million, or $1.25 a share, on sales of $3.18 billion.
"I think the market reaction is a bit overdone," Mr. Jones said. "But the mood on the Street for technology is definitely bearish right now. In the current economy, people are using every excuse they can find not to buy."
Mr. Schulman and Mr. Jones both said Digital's long-term strategy was fundamentally sound, and they were still bullish on the company's prospects, though not all analysts share that view.

HEADLINE: CONSUMER RATES;
Tax-Exempt Money Market Yields Rise

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH M. FOWLER

 BODY:
Yields on tax-exempt money market funds reversed course in the last week and strengthened a little, according to IBC/Donoghue's, which monitors the funds and issues The Money Fund Report. The taxable funds continued their steady downward progress.
Walter S. Frank, chief economist for IBC/Donoghue's, said the tax-exempt yields rose "partly because of the recent large supply of municipal issues coming to market and a diminished appetite among investors for short-term securities at current low yields." 
 He pointed out that total assets of the tax-exempts dropped for the week by $720 million, to $92.7 billion. The average days to maturity of the tax-free funds' portfolio holdings rose by a day, to 59 days.
The seven-day compound average yield for the tax-exempts rose by 5 basis points, from 3.75 percent a week ago to 3.80 percent. The seven-day simple yield for the tax-exempt funds also rose 5 basis points, to 3.73 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of 1 percent.
The 30-day compound yield was unchanged from the previous week at 3.77 percent, while the 30-day simple yield was also unchanged at 3.70.
Among tax-exempt funds investing in individual state securities, the top New York Fund was once again Salomon Brothers New York Municipal Money Market Fund, which reported a seven-day compound yield of 4.48 percent, up a notch from 4.47 percent a week ago.
In Connecticut, the top-yielding fund this week was Dreyfus Conn. Municipal Money Market Fund, with a seven-day compound yield of 4.14 percent, compared with the leader's yield last week of 4.04 percent.
New Jersey's leading fund for yields was again Calvert Tax Free Reserve New Jersey with a seven-day compound yield of 4.30 percent, compared with 4.24 percent a week ago.
Nationwide, among those funds with $100 million or more assets, the highest-yield performance for the week was once again turned in by the Strong Municipal Money Market Fund, with a seven-day compound yield of 4.80 percent. compared with 4.74 percent a week ago.
 
Public Went Elsewhere
 Turning to the taxable funds, Mr. Frank said their total assets showed a sizable decline of $3 billion, to $475.1 billion, and most of the selling -- $2.6 billion -- came from individuals.
"The public was seeking higher yields elsewhere," Mr. Frank said. "Taxable money fund yields will continue to decline although in the weeks before the year-end we will be seeing some window dressing, or making the balance sheet look better, which traditionally raises money fund yields at year-end."
The average days to maturity of the portfolio holdings dropped by a day, to 61 days.
The seven-day compound yield on the taxable funds was 4.70 percent, down from 4.73 percent, while the seven-day simple yield for the taxable funds was 4.59 percent, down from 4.63 percent.
The average compound 30-day yield dropped was 4.77 percent, down 4 basis points, and the 30-day simple yield was also down 4 basis points, to 4.66 percent. Among the taxables, the top-yielding fund for the week was the Twentieth Century Cash Reserve Fund, Kansas City, Mo., with a surprising yield of 17.76 percent, attributable to its taking capital gains.
By comparison, bank money market accounts, a main competitor of money funds, dropped to a yield of 4.51, compared with 4.59 percent last week, according to The Bank Rate Monitor's national index.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Mostly Higher; No Action on Rates Is Seen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar settled mostly higher on world currency markets yesterday amid hints that interest rates in the United States would hold at present levels, at least for the short term.
Gold prices advanced worldwide. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $359 an ounce, up $1.70 from Tuesday. Later, the Republic National Bank said gold gained $1.30, to a late bid price of $358.80. 
 The dollar initially declined as traders sold the currency in anticipation that the Federal Reserve would move swiftly to cut interest rates. Lower interest rates make dollar-denominated securities less attractive to investors.
But the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, indicated in testimony before Congress that the central bank, while prepared to cut rates to help revive the economy, was not inclined to take immediate action.
"Traders took that to mean that interest rate differentials would be a bit better than expected, so the dollar was bid up," said Randolph Donney, research director at Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J.
Traders were also awaiting a news briefing scheduled for today by Germany's Bundesbank. The market is divided on whether the Bundesbank will announce a rate increase, which would hurt the dollar because investors may shift funds to capture higher yields on German fixed-income securities.
Activity was particularly light. "There is no corporate interest whatsoever," said Kevin Lawrie, chief dealer at the Bank of Boston. "One sizable order could knock the market one way or another."
He predicted the dollar would remain in a tight range until the new year. "People either made or lost their money and are quitting for the year," he said.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose to 128.42 Japanese yen, from 128.28 yen at Tuesday's close. Later in London, it fell to 128.40 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 128.35 yen, up from 128.29 yen on Tuesday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.8253, from $1.8200 late Tuesday. In New York it cost $1.8290 to buy one pound, more expensive than Tuesday's $1.8275.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's rates, included: 1.5715 German marks, up from 1.5703; 1.3925 Swiss francs, up from 1.3885; 5.3700 French francs, up from 5.3635; 1,187.00 Italian lire, unchanged, and 1.1470 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1461.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Blue Jays Make Morris Baseball's Richest Pitcher

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
For the fourth time in the last six winters, Jack Morris signed a contract as a free agent yesterday, and this time he became the highest-paid pitcher on baseball's ever-escalating salary scale. The Toronto Blue Jays, who have always had difficulty luring major free agents to Canada, captured Morris with a contract that guarantees him $10.85 million for two years.
The Boston Red Sox, who also had sought Morris's services, were on the verge of reaching agreement with their alternate choice, Frank Viola, on a three-year contract for about $14 million. Viola rejected the Mets' three-year, $13 million offer last April. 
 Morris's average of $5,425,000 a year sent the World Series hero leapfrogging past Roger Clemens's average annual value of $5,380,250 and Dwight Gooden's $5.15 million and placed him No. 2 on the overall list behind outfielder Bobby Bonilla's $5.8 million.
Morris, 36 years old, parlayed his 10-inning, 1-0 seventh-game victory over Atlanta 52 days ago and an unusual clause in his Minnesota contract into a new package that will pay him a $1.85 million signing bonus and salaries of $3.5 million and $4.5 million. The Blue Jays have an option for a third year with a $5.15 million salary, or they will pay him $1 million if they do not exercise the option.
Morris, who earned $3.7 million this year, became a free agent for the fourth time because he did not exercise the option he had in the contract he signed with the Twins as a free agent last February. The option would have paid him $3.65 million in 1992.
 
Significance Beyond Economics
 The new agreement, which was reached in approximately five hours of meetings club officials had in Toronto with the pitcher and his lawyer, Richard Moss, offered significance beyond economics. The Blue Jays have been one of baseball's most successful expansion teams, but they have never reached the World Series in their 15-year history.
"He has that competitive fire," Gord Ash, the assistant general manager, said in Toronto, explaining the club's willingness to pay such a high price. "He always wants to win. You would realize his competitiveness if you had been privileged to sit in on the negotiations."
Morris beat the Blue Jays in the first and fourth games of the American League pennant playoff, then won the first and seventh games of the World Series. He produced a remarkable performance in the seventh game, working with three days' rest instead of the customary four, rejecting efforts by Manager Tom Kelly to remove him from the game and escaping one difficult circumstance after another until the Twins finally scored a run in the 10th.
The veteran right-hander, a native of St. Paul, Minn., was thrilled to sign with the Twins last winter after spending his first 13 major league years with the Detroit Tigers. He said he preferred staying at home, but the Twins stopped short of offering him a contract that would put him in the Clemens-Goodens economic class.
"It was a tough decision," Morris told reporters in Toronto. "I have mixed emotions about what happened in Minnesota, but I think that can happen here, too. I enjoyed the year. It was one of the greatest of my career. I love Minnesota. I always have. But I like this team, and I like pitching in the dome."
Morris, who had an 18-12 record last season, initially wanted a guaranteed three-year contract, but no one was offering one. The Red Sox indicated they would, but Morris preferred pitching in the Skydome to Fenway Park. The Blue Jays offered him a two-year deal last week guaranteeing $10.75 million with the same option provisions for the third year.
In the negotiations yesterday, the Blue Jays added $100,000 to the total package and agreed to give Morris a chunk of the first-year salary as part of a larger signing bonus. The adjustments were made to cover the higher taxes Canada extracts from players' salaries. The Blue Jays also agreed to pay large chunks of the salaries on April 1 each year, $750,000 the first year and $1 million the second.
Morris will move into a starting rotation with Jimmy Key and Dave Stieb, if they are healthy, plus Todd Stottlemyre and Juan Guzman.
When Viola completes his agreement with the Red Sox, which was expected to be no later than today, he will join Clemens in the Boston rotation. The Red Sox were desperate to find an established starter who could fit in behind Clemens, generally considered the best pitcher in the majors.
Viola could have accepted the Mets' offer of salary arbitration before tonight's midnight deadline and become a free agent again next year, but the Red Sox have given him good reason not to take that step.
 
INSIDE PITCH
 MITCH WILLIAMS, a free-agent relief pitcher, re-signed with the Philadelphia Phillies for three years and $9.2 million. A year ago that deal would have been impressive. Now it's almost routine.

HEADLINE: The Economy: Go Fast, and Slow

 BODY:
The economy suffers from two ailments. For 20 years incomes have stagnated, leaving the middle class little better off than it was in the 1970's. Apart from that stagnation, the economy started sliding into recession in 1990, a slide that has now accelerated -- as witness the deep cuts announced yesterday by General Motors.
The remedy for the first problem is less consumption and more investment. The remedy for the second is more consumption. By confusing the two ailments, Congress is tying itself in knots. 
 The first need is to separate the problems and, for now, deal only with the recession. And the best way to do that is for Congress, immediately on its return in January, to pass a quick-hitting combination of temporary tax cuts and spending increases. The key word is temporary.
To reverse stagnation, Congress will need to write a savings-oriented tax code. But that intricate task can't be done quickly, especially not in an election year. It would be best left to an expert commission that reports back after the election.
Robert Solow of M.I.T. and Francis Bator of Harvard offer an ideal plan to fight recession. They propose a one-year, $80 billion cut in Federal income and payroll taxes. At the same time they would increase for one year all Federal grants to state and local governments by 10 percent. The idea is to raise spending immediately, focusing on mothballed projects that could be rapidly reopened.
The fiscal stimulus would be almost five times larger than that proposed by House Democratic leaders and three times the rebate of $300 per taxpayer that is under review in the White House. That would be big enough to matter but not to destabilize the economy if recovery begins soon.
The most important feature of the Solow-Bator plan is summed up in the word temporary. Because the tax cut and spending increases would expire in a year, they wouldn't raise the long-term deficit and thus would not jeopardize long-term savings.
What about proposals to subsidize business investment and personal savings? They wouldn't shorten the recession and would not, in many cases, even make sense within existing tax law.
For example, several economists call for stimulating investment by allowing businesses immediately to deduct the entire cost of long-lived investments, a practice known as expensing. But as Prof. Robert Hall of Stanford shrewdly observes, expensing makes little sense with tax laws that also permit tax-free contributions to pension funds.
With expensing, businesses would be able to borrow at tax-subsidized rates from pension funds and then use the money for tax-subsidized investments. That would amount to a double subsidy, inviting wasteful investment.
The tax code cannot be fixed hastily. Revision has to include a comprehensive plan for promoting saving, but without penalizing the poor who ordinarily save little. That job could be left to a bipartisan commission, with a post-election deadline that offers insulation from special pleading and election-year politics.
Without such insulation, Congress would be tempted to act rashly. That's why the Solow-Bator plan makes good political as well as economic sense. Come January, Congress can act boldly to give the slumping economy a temporary jolt. The key word is temporary.

HEADLINE: Russia Deserves The Soviet Seat

BYLINE: By Richard N. Gardner and Toby Trister Gati; Richard N. Gardner, former U.S. Ambassador to Italy, is professor of international law at Columbia. Toby Trister Gati is senior vice president of the United Nations Association.

 BODY:
The new commonwealth and the independent republics that will replace the Soviet Union are confronting the international community with potentially explosive legal and political conundrums. Some may be resolved when the republics meet in Kazakhstan on Saturday to address commonwealth issues. 
 Who will take over the Soviet seat in the U.N. General Assembly and Security Council, inheriting the veto? Will Russia take the Council seat, as President Boris Yeltsin wants? Will all the republics join the U.N., in addition to Byelorussia and Ukraine, which are members? Who should be admitted to the International Monetary Fund and World Bank?
Commonwealth members do not agree on who should take the Council seat. Ukraine would support Russia's taking it over. President Nursultan Nazarbayev made it clear to Secretary of State James Baker this week that Kazakhstan and the other Central Asian republics will not automatically cede the seat to Russia.
If the Commonwealth of Independent States wanted to occupy the Soviet Union's Council and General Assembly seats while the republics were also Assembly members, this would be bad politics and bad international law: bad law because the Charter permits only "states" -- countries -- to be members.
To qualify as a state, an entity must have a government capable of exercising executive and legislative authority over a population, and the capacity to carry out an independent foreign policy. Without such powers, an entity could not carry out U.N. decisions. A loose commonwealth whose only purpose is to coordinate the domestic and foreign policies of independent republics would qualify as an international organization, but would not be a state.
Seating a loose commonwealth in the Council with a right of veto would put at risk the excellent cooperation that the five permanent members established during and after the Persian Gulf crisis. The Islamic republics would likely use their influence to block the commonwealth from supporting military action against another Middle East aggressor like Saddam Hussein.
The best legal and political solution would be to give Russia the Soviet seat and admit the other nine republics as new members. Giving the Council seat to a Russia whose leaders are Western-oriented, dedicated to democracy and human rights and committed to developing a market economy would be the best assurance that Moscow's exceptional cooperation in recent years would continue. (Surely a condition should be that Russia would take over a suitable portion of the Soviet Union's financial contributions -- with the other republics picking up the rest -- and pay up the Soviet Union's arrears.)
It would also avoid a constitutional crisis that could paralyze the U.N. if the Council seat were left vacant or if other members pressed for other changes in the Council.
Washington should support early membership in the I.M.F. and World Bank for Russia, Ukraine, Byelorussia and Kazakhstan in place of the Soviet Union's associate status. These republics have the best chance of developing market economies that can be integrated into the world economy. Membership would make them eligible to get financial aid and have their politically difficult transitions to market economies reinforced by internationally monitored programs.
Early U.N. membership for the republics would also serve global interests. Except for Russia, the republics are governed by leaders with little experience in international relations and an uncertain commitment to established international norms. Membership in the U.N. could school them for world citizenship.
It makes sense for Russia to assume the Soviet Union's rights and obligations at the U.N., since Russia exercises authority over 150 million people and controls some 75 percent of the land mass and valuable resources of the Soviet Union. And that goes out of business New Year's Eve. Unless the commonwealth resolves the problem satisfactorily by then, on Jan. 1 the Soviet Union will exist only at the U.N.

HEADLINE: In the Nation;
After The Storm

BYLINE: By TOM WICKER; William Safire is on vacation.

 BODY:
Can anyone recall a disappearance more precipitous than that of the national celebration of Desert Storm, last winter's great victory in the Persian Gulf -- the war whose fighting men and women, unlike those of Vietnam, were to be honored and remembered?
The honors, like yellow ribbons, quickly came and went. The remembrance of the war, as evidenced by polls and public statements, has been equally short-lived, and soured by the survival of Saddam Hussein in Iraq. 
 President Bush's popularity, meanwhile, has gone south just as swiftly. The astronomical approval ratings he registered during and after the war -- around 90 percent in some cases -- have slipped to as low as 47 percent in a recent ABC News/Washington Post Poll. He's back to roughly the level of approval he had in 1989, in the midst of that year's "budget crisis," before the war made him look briefly Churchillian.
The best evidence of Mr. Bush's decline in public esteem may be his plaintive remarks the other day about the "filth and indecent material coming in through the airwaves and through these trials into people's homes." The obvious reference to the Palm Beach rape case might have been taken as merely a political slap at the Kennedy family, had the President not also criticized New York City's program to counter AIDS with free condoms for young people and clean needles for drug addicts.
AIDS, Mr. Bush chirped, "is a disease that for the most part can be controlled by individual behavior."
That's the Bushspeak equivalent of Nancy Reagan's "just say no" campaign, which didn't work either. Mr. Bush seemed to be turning to a tried-and-true, if threadbare, political remedy -- attacking a straw man, in this case indecency, to deflect attention from his lack of a coherent economic program and from foreign policies that look less effective every day.
Social concerns -- flag-burning, the Pledge of Allegiance, "family values," the fear of crime -- have been highly effective for him and for other Republicans in the past; remember the Mapplethorpe flap? Maybe this time preaching against "smut and filth" can do the trick for Mr. Bush.
Or maybe not. The economy is in bad shape and Republicans, as well as too many Democrats, have locked themselves into the nearly theological position that nothing can be done if it increases the budget deficit -- though the likelihood is that nothing effective can be done if it doesn't increase the budget deficit. More than at any time in the past quarter-century, the so-called "pocketbook issue" may be helping the Democrats -- assuming they find a presentable candidate for President.
But the economy alone is not responsible for Mr. Bush's tumble from grace. His response to political and economic chaos in the former Soviet Union may be properly restrained, but to much of the public it looks like indecisive hand-wringing about one of the signal developments of the 20th century. Nor does the Administration appear to know how to be helpful on the economic and other problems of Eastern Europe -- for instance, street crime, the redheaded stepchild of capitalism. It's up fivefold in Prague since Communism's collapse.
Japan and Western Europe go their ways, Washington notwithstanding. The nasty war in Yugoslavia is a bad advertisement for the "new world order" Mr. Bush proclaimed last winter; but there's little he can do about it, since the use of U.S. military power there would be unpopular among Americans. In all these cases, in fact, the power at Mr. Bush's disposal is mostly military; but in none would that power be appropriate or feasible.
Force might be both in Iraq, where Saddam Hussein's nuclear designs seem clear and his brutal control appears unaffected by what the world thought was catastrophic defeat. But it would be an admission of an early and mistaken end to the war, hence a smudge on his most acclaimed achievement, were Mr. Bush to order troops back to the gulf to finish the job. Nor is it clear that this time he'd have worldwide support.
Both at home and abroad, therefore, challenge and change are demanding more of George Bush -- vision, bold leadership, intuitive understanding -- than he seems able to give. Nearly a year after Desert Storm, his moment of glory seems far in the past, and irrelevant to a future in which standing tall will rarely be sufficient.

HEADLINE: In Nicaragua, Free Enterprise Never Left

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Nicaraguans, your headline states, "Are Back in Business" ("Managua Journal," Nov. 22). You see vendors on street corners peddling their wares to passing cars as an indication that the people are "rebuilding a market economy." Those of us who have known Nicaragua over the last decade see no surprise in this miniature example of private business in Managua or other parts of the country. It is an old characteristic of the peoples of poor countries, like paperboys, push-cart vendors and kids selling in buses or from door to door goodies made in mom's kitchen. 
 The streets of Managua have always been lined with stalls selling soft drinks, food or trinkets and kiosks for books or newspapers. Many turn their front windowsills into mini-minimarkets for the sale of candy or cookies. In smaller towns and cities there are no stores, and people do their shopping in the homes of neighbors. Signs are posted saying "Meat today" or "Nacatamales," but most people just know where to buy their eggs, bread, newspapers or clothing.
This kind of "free market" is not new in Nicaragua. Nor does it mean the country is "back in business." There has always been business, large and small, in the country. The Sandinistas still boast of a "mixed economy" that sponsored three types of economic structures: private agricultural and industrial enterprises; private cooperatives, and state properties established where the Somoza dictators had built their fortunes.
The Sandinistas recognized that the poor majority of the people can develop farms or industries on their own if given the chance. Unfortunately these plans were misinterpreted in some parts of the industrialized world, and the United States economic embargo and support for the contras eventually made it impossible for these plans to reach development.
Now is the time for the completion of these designs for a mixed economy and also for the political pluralism called for by the Sandinistas. President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, whose husband was murdered by the Somoza dictatorship, seems to understand the value of the private cooperatives developed by the Sandinistas to help the vast majority raise themselves out of dire poverty.
There are lessons to be learned from the Nicaraguan experience as newly liberated lands try to build their future.

HEADLINE: We Need Both Big Science and Little Science;
Slide Rule Pork Barrel

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Gregg Easterbrook's "Big Science on Easy Street" (Op-Ed, Nov. 29) is exactly on target, but his argument can be extended. 
 Federal big-science spending has been guided by a politics of display, a taste for the heroic media event, since the space race of the 1960's. Teeing off on the moon provided the United States and several administrations with propaganda mileage that has yet to be rediscovered. It was a mask to cover urban riots and a divisive war. Despite the ostensible technical virtuosity of a space station or supercollider, these projects make few compelling photo opportunities, so the Government won't even achieve its unstated goals with them.
One suspects sectional politics in all of this. Just as the massive military budgets of the last half-century and the savings and loan institution and bank bailouts of recent years have transferred billions of dollars from the North to the Sunbelt, so, too, do most big-science projects. The supercollider is more pork for Texas, just as the space station is welfare for Sunbelt military contractors facing the end of cold war spending.
Big science projects only thinly conceal that the United States has no coherent direction in its science programs. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has managed to maintain funding momentum, though it has lacked any clear program goals since 1969 beyond low-grade shuttle stunts and highly cost-effective unmanned probes. Physicists get their supercollider largely because of the cultural momentum developed in the public mind by Einstein's generation of scientists.
Such funds could be better spent. Small science, particularly through the National Science Foundation, has generated a much higher rate of economic benefits for the public funds invested in it.
Also, the Government was willing to build a new National Archives facility, yet refuses it the few millions necessary to turn it into the service provider the nation desperately needs. As public and private universities face deep cutbacks, more and more students are denied financial access and the quality of higher education is in ever-greater jeopardy. Meanwhile, the professoriate is but a few years away from massive retirements, and there are neither graduate students to replace them nor funds available to train the students.
The politics of scientific and technological display and the pork barreling associated with it need to be replaced by a coherent plan for the careful programming that will revive American scientific and academic leadership.

HEADLINE: Cures May Be Worse Than Economic Ills

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As a result of the profligate Reagan years the traditional tools of financial management, monetary and fiscal policy, are no longer available to bring the economy out of recession. Fiscal policy has been rendered unusable by the size of the debt, monetary policy by the near destruction of the banking system and the financial integration of the world economy. 
 The route out of recession in the 1930's was to let the economy deflate, with massive unemployment and bankruptcies, followed by reflation in the 1940's and 50's. Today, such an approach is politically unacceptable.
There seems to be tacit agreement in both political camps that to end the recession the real burden of the debt must be destroyed by inflating the economy. And the politically acceptable way of doing this is through wide-scale "middle class" tax cuts.
It is not clear to me that this cure will not be more disastrous than the disease. The public may be best served by Government inaction, by a policy of "Just stand there." One way or another, the cost of the 1980's must be borne.

HEADLINE: Street-Wise Impresario;
Sharpton Calls the Tunes, and Players Take Their Cues

BYLINE: By MARTIN GOTTLIEB with DEAN BAQUET

 BODY:
When Richard Earl Luke died in the custody of the housing police on a balmy evening in May 1989, it did not take long for rumors and anger to race through the Queensbridge public housing project where he lived. His mother, Patricia Garcia, recalls that by morning her phone was ringing nonstop. Friends offered condolences. Family members checked in. In one instance, she remembers, she even received a call from someone she had never heard of -- the Rev. Al Sharpton.
Mrs. Garcia remembers that the reverend extended sympathy and offered assistance. Within an hour, she said, he was in her apartment with a handful of aides, reciting a prayer, pledging to cover funeral costs and suggesting the legal services of his brother in arms, Alton H. Maddox Jr. In the next few days, Mr. Sharpton led marches through her neighborhood while tensions roiled.
 
Projecting an Image
 The demonstrations soon died down, and a few months later, Mr. Sharpton moved on after what he describes as a falling-out with Mrs. Garcia, whose family still argues about him. Now, when she watches Mr. Sharpton on television, Mrs. Garcia says, she sometimes muses that he might have simply forsaken her for higher-profile cases. 
 "I often wonder about that," she said. Still, she says, she is a Sharpton supporter, because without him, "my son would have just been another black boy killed by the police."
In a score of cases over a half-decade, from Atlantic Beach, L.I., to Hillside, N.J., this most improbable protest leader has played the same role, often with the same ambiguous results. Through these cases, lacking a congregation, a balanced bank account or even a large corps of followers, he has projected himself as the pre-eminent leader of disaffected blacks in New York City.
And in many respects, he has become what he said he was.
Despite a history of associations with organized crime figures and an affinity for outrageous rhetoric and dubious charges, Mr. Sharpton, more than anyone, has come to dictate the times and terms under which one of the nation's most sensitive social issues -- race -- is dealt with in the New York region and often beyond.
 
A Master of Many Arts
 As impresario of an abrasive floating street theater involving demonstrations of rarely more than a few hundred people, Mr. Sharpton has managed to grab headlines and jangle the public psyche like no one else. But he is more than a master media manipulator and a man who capitalized on a void in black leadership in New York City.
An examination of Mr. Sharpton's rise also shows how his ever-precarious career has fed on alliances of the moment, alliances that raise questions about his motives, judgment and the extent of his following.
Today, his most important and least well-known connection is with the New Alliance Party, a political splinter group that has been accused of operating like a cult, engaging in anti-Semitism and disrupting other liberal and left-wing groups. New Alliance and its affiliates have virtually adopted Mr. Sharpton, providing a fourth of his modest income, legal and public-relations help, and, its leader says, as many as half the people at some of his marches.
Earlier, Mr. Sharpton had become enmeshed with organized-crime figures in the entertainment world. And law-enforcement officials have said he entered into another odd alliance -- with them. Offering fresh details of his role as an informant, they say he provided information that helped in the conviction of the boss of the Genovese crime family in Rockland County and much of Westchester.
 
'He Knows How to Manipulate'
 Much of the reason for his public prominence goes unacknowledged, lost in the infuriated responses to his often incendiary statements, which critics say not only inflame already painful situations but keep different racial and economic groups from finding common goals.
Beyond his sound bites and tabloid television word jousts, the 37-year-old Mr. Sharpton is a powerful, often mesmerizing speaker. One on one, he can be so engaging and witty that even investigators who have probed his finances and mob connections admit an odd fondness toward him. He is a quick study, a factory of oratory who digests and sometimes bends facts in split seconds and converts them into rhetoric. And, in a media-driven age, he has crafted a public image that has sucked up the air around it, along with a few forests worth of newsprint.
"You know who made him a leader?" asked Hazel Dukes, president of the New York State chapter of the N.A.A.C.P. "The media. The rest of us do things, and you just pass it off. He knows how to manipulate you."
Mr. Sharpton puts it differently.
"I created Al Sharpton," he explained recently, his brown processed curls bobbing with the emphasis. "I wore my hair like this. I dressed like this. I talked like this. I weighed this much. That was my persona. The media just covered it."
This persona, Mr. Sharpton says, has allowed him to fulfill the traditional role of the lightning-rod cleric who verbalizes the feelings of disfranchised blacks. He defends New Alliance as an important organization on the left, and says his involvements with organized-crime figures were unwitting ones, regrettable episodes in a life he has engineered so that the chapter titles are written in headline type.
 
The Persona
A Rise to Fame On a Shoestring
 For many prominent blacks in New York, such as Mayor David N. Dinkins and Ms. Dukes, Mr. Sharpton's rise has been baffling. The organizations they have been associated with have dues-paying memberships in the hundreds and thousands and often maintain large-scale social service operations.
Mr. Sharpton's nonprofit organization, the National Action Network, had $16.43 in its account at the Amalgamated Bank of New York at the end of September, according to documents he supplied. After bouncing five checks in a month, Mr. Sharpton's private promotional company, Raw Talent, had a negative balance of $189.75. After being acquitted at a state charity fraud trial, he is still under indictment for not filing state tax statements for several years.
Mr. Sharpton's staff is composed of three people: Jennifer Joseph, whom he met at the payola trial of the disk jockey Frankie Crocker more than a decade ago; Carl Redding, a 27-year-old linebacker-size Man Friday, and Anthony Charles, who volunteers for Mr. Sharpton after work at the Postal Service Express Mail depot in Brooklyn. None of his staff people earns more than $300 a week, he says.
His base of followers is modest. The turnout at a recent weekly meeting of what he calls his "nut group," meaning his core group, for example, reached 84 at its height. Yet it was at this meeting, broadcast over WWRL-AM from a three-quarters empty public school auditorium in Harlem, that many of Mr. Sharpton's strengths became apparent.
The audience was made up of black New Yorkers young and old, middle class and struggling. It included women like Bertha C. Richardson, who turned to Mr. Sharpton after her sister Mary Mitchell was killed by the police during a domestic dispute last year; younger men like Stevie D., a rap singer who lives a privately run shelter and considers Mr. Sharpton "the most courageous brother of our times," and Lenora Fulani, the perennial Presidential and gubernatorial candidate of the New Alliance Party.
 
Speaking in Black and White
 Mr. Sharpton slowly entered from the rear as an aide, Roslyn Bacon, in a slow, silken voice, implored the audience to "welcome our cleric, our corpulent cleric, the one and only Rev. Alfred C. Sharpton!"
As usual before a speech, a wary impassiveness deadened his features. But as he bellowed his trademark chant -- "No Justice, No Peace!" -- he seemed to wake up. Then in rocking cadence and raspy voice, he unleashed his populist news commentary.
He referred to Mayor Dinkins as "weak-kneed," to 82-year-old Dr. James Dumpson, an elder statesman to many black New Yorkers and the head of the city's besieged hospital system, as "old, senile James Dumpson," to the choice of Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, whom he supported for re-election in 1986, and his possible Democratic opponents as one among "some recycled white trash."
Why was Dr. Leonard Jeffries threatened with the loss of his job at City College while former Mayor Edward I. Koch could get away with referring to Ronald V. Dellums, the black congressman from California, as a "Zulu warrior"? Why had Mr. Sharpton himself been charged with fraud in a 67-count indictment while the Rev. Bruce Ritter was left unprosecuted after allegations of sexual and financial improprieties?
Mr. Sharpton's parallels may be debatable, but for him, the answers were black and white. "I consider this double-standard something I will fight all of my life," he concluded.
If 84 people can create thunderous applause, they did so that day.
 
The Informant
Surrogate Father And Family Ties
 Mr. Sharpton was preaching from Brooklyn pulpits at age 4, and at 10 was ordained by the Rev. F. D. Washington, a Pentecostal minister with prodigious political connections.
That same year, Mr. Sharpton says, his father, Alfred Sr., who ran a construction company and owned 15 rental properties, deserted the family, which was forced to move from its two-family home in Hollis, Queens, to an apartment in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. His mother, a seamstress, went on welfare.
Mr. Sharpton remains angry at his father, who he says contacted him for the first time in nearly 25 years after he was stabbed in an assassination attempt this year. He says friends had to talk him into taking the call. In the absence of his own father, he began a search for surrogates that led him, at 13, to the soul-singing legend James Brown, who took him under his wing and brought him into the music world.
It was there, while developing political and civil-rights connections elsewhere, that Mr. Sharpton met mobsters.
For a time, Mr. Sharpton's base organization, the National Youth Movement, made use of the offices of Spring Records, owned by a close associate of Mr. Brown's, Julie Rifkind. Though Mr. Rifkind denies it, Mr. Sharpton said Mr. Rifkind introduced him to several people who turned out to be organized-crime figures. Among them were Michael Franzese, a former Colombo family capo, and Daniel Pagano, who with his father, Joseph, reportedly ran Genovese family operations in Westchester and Rockland Counties. They figured dramatically in an event that would cloud Mr. Sharpton's reputation.
 
The Disputed Bluff

The outline has been widely reported. In 1983, Mr. Franzese told Mr. Sharpton that an associate, who later turned out to be an undercover F.B.I. agent, wanted to sponsor boxing matches and was looking for an introduction to the promoter Don King. A meeting was held in a high-rent Lincoln Square apartment, where the agent turned the subject from boxing to drug deals.
"He said he had some guys who needed to move some stuff if we knew anybody," Mr. Sharpton recalled. "We told him we didn't know people like that."
Law enforcement officials say Mr. Sharpton did nothing illegal, and that the agent did most of the talking. Nonetheless, they said they later confronted Mr. Sharpton and bluffed him into thinking they had a case. He became an informant, they said, but what he actually provided is murky.
A review of previously undisclosed court documents and interviews with several law enforcement officials indicates that Mr. Sharpton provided information in a successful investigation of Daniel Pagano.
The state had been investigating the Paganos, but it lacked a first-hand source who could confirm suspicions that the family's most sensitive meetings were held in Joseph Pagano's basement. Without such confirmation, a judge would never allow an electronic bug to be planted there.
 
F.B.I.'s 'Confidential Source'
 On Jan. 31, 1986, however, the officials told a judge in Rockland County that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had given them a "confidential source" who said he had been involved in some of the discussions, and who offered a detailed description of the basement. Their source, the officials now say, was Mr. Sharpton.
The bug was approved, and the recordings provided evidence against Joseph Pagano, who died before he could be indicted, and his son, who is serving a prison term of 1 1/3 to 4 years.
Mr. Sharpton denies providing the information. He said he was friendly with Daniel Pagano but did not know he was a mobster. He said that he may have met Joseph Pagano in passing and that he visited one of the Pagano houses but it was Daniel's.
"I never gave anyone a description of either house, no one asked me," he said.
Mr. Sharpton said he did help in drug and organized-crime investigations, but did so voluntarily after being threatened by a mobster in the record industry.
The early stories about Mr. Sharpton and law enforcement all but destroyed his already tenuous relationship with some black radical groups.
Meanwhile, other events isolated Mr. Sharpton from the public and from many civil-rights leaders. Even as he and his closest allies -- Mr. Maddox and C. Vernon Mason -- won supporters for championing the causes of black victims, their credibility was severely damaged by a series of rash, unsupported allegations in several cases, including the killing of Michael Griffith in Howard Beach and the allegations of rape made by Tawana Brawley, an incident Mr. Sharpton says he still believes took place.
During rallies at the Slave Theater in Brooklyn -- inaccessible to many whites -- the oratory grew still hotter and more divisive. Mr. Sharpton derided whites of all ethnicities, repeatedly used the word "faggots," and continually characterized black people who disagreed with him as "cocktail-sip Negroes," "yellow niggers" and "Negro militants" who carried "that German cracker's books under their arms."
That German cracker was Karl Marx.
Mr. Sharpton now says he regrets such language, but his critics say the damage has been done.
Jim Sleeper, an editorial writer at Newsday and author of "The Closest of Strangers," a book about race in New York City, sees Mr. Sharpton as "re-enacting an historically powerful truth" -- the injustice toward blacks by the police and the courts -- even in situations where it does not apply. The result, says Mr. Sleeper, gives voice to a deep-seated pain, but also divides Mr. Sharpton's followers from others.
Deputy Mayor Bill Lynch, a veteran of black political wars in the city who is also critical of Mr. Sharpton, says he has only become such a public figure because of the press's attraction to his flamboyance and a gap in black leadership.
"What he's been able to do is fill a void out there in the wrong way, and that's what has to be looked at," Mr. Lynch said. "Our leaders have to be criticized."
 
The Spokesman
Victims' Friend Is Sometimes Foe
 Mr. Sharpton receives no greater testimonials than those of the families who feel he has helped them.
"When the reverend came, things started happening," says Sharon Mayse, whose 16-year-old daughter, Tasha, was killed in Hillside, N.J., in June when the police fired into a stolen church van in which the teen-ager was a passenger. "When I was under so much pressure he came down and gave me money to go away for the weekend. He helped me pay for my phone bill. I talk with him all the time on the phone. It's like he's a telephone call away."
In some instances, such as the 1989 slaying of Yusuf K. Hawkins in Bensonhurst, a distraught family member will reach out to Mr. Sharpton. In others, such as the beating of Alfred Jermaine Ewell in June by white teen-agers in Atlantic Beach, L.I., a neighborhood clergyman friendly with Mr. Sharpton will suggest that a hesitant family see him.
Sometimes, as at the wake of Phillip C. Pannell, the Teaneck, N.J., youth who was fatally shot by a police officer in April 1990, Mr. Sharpton will get the cold shoulder, although in this case he was later welcomed by the family and now advises Phillip's mother.
 
The Inevitable March

 Often he will offer families money for expenses. In the case of Jermaine Ewell's mother, Mr. Sharpton visited the hospital, peeled a $100 bill off a roll of money and gave it to her to help cover expenses, said a family spokesman. In others, he has offered to pay for funerals, Christmas presents and rent.
Once his help is accepted, Mr. Sharpton limits press access to the family, a strategy that he says protects grieving relatives, but one that also turns him into a spokesman. He remembers reporters' names, continues to speak to them when they write critically and promises exclusive interviews that sometimes don't occur.
"Most public relations people wish they were as good as he is," said Dominick Carter, a reporter for WLIB radio. "He knows how to manipulate the press. I mean that as a compliment."
A key part of the Sharpton strategy is the inevitable march. In Bensonhurst, Mr. Sharpton ordered more than 30.
But 30 marches, even if many involved fewer than 100 people, required a standing army that could be called upon week after week. New Alliance gave him this and more.
 
New Alliance Connection
 For more than 20 years, the party's founder, Fred Newman, has attempted to establish the movement as the nation's pre-eminent force in left-wing politics, much to the consternation of other organizations, which have accused it of disruptive, divisive and even conspiratorial tactics. The saga of Mr. Newman and his followers includes a flirtation with the political extremist Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr. and a large psychotherapy practice that critics say is little more than a mass-production line for new party members.
"It creates tremendous peer pressure within the group for obedience to its guru, Fred Newman," said Chip Berlet, a researcher for Political Research Associates, a nonprofit organization in Boston that investigates authoritarian groups.
Mr. Newman dismisses the criticisms as absurd and usually the product of jealousies on the left. He said most therapy clients don't involve themselves in the political party.
Mr. Newman says New Alliance is dedicated to challenging the political system and fighting for the rights of black, Hispanic gay and other minority group members. He said the organization's spinoff groups raise millions of dollars a year through the psychotherapy practice, a lobbying and fund-raising network and street solicitations for numerous political campaigns that attract public matching funds. The party and its members have spawned a law firm, a theater group, a public relations and booking company, a publishing arm, a telemarketing concern and a primary school in Harlem.
 
$20,000 for Speeches
 Mr. Newman said that since last year, when their relationship matured, New Alliance has provided between 30 and 50 percent of the troops at Mr. Sharpton's demonstrations.
It has done even more for his personal finances, much of which Mr. Sharpton says he funnels into his organization. This year, the party's lecture and media booking company, Castillo International, began lining up national speaking engagements for Mr. Sharpton. He has earned roughly $20,000 for at least 20 speeches at universities and churches, many of them booked by Castillo, which keeps 30 percent of the proceeds, but does his public relations without compensation.
Mr. Newman also made Mr. Sharpton a 50-percent partner in his private company that runs a nationwide teen-age talent competition. According to records provided by Mr. Sharpton, he received at least $12,000 this year from the enterprise. Not counting lecture work, Mr. Sharpton's ties to New Alliance and Mr. Newman accounted for about 25 percent of his income, which he estimated to be about $50,000 this year, according to records supplied by his accountant, P. Daniel Faustin.
Mr. Sharpton, who lives with his wife, Cathy Lee Jordan, and two young daughters in a $1,200-a-month garden apartment in Englewood, N.J., and also shares an apartment in Crown Heights with an aide, works out of a small office in a West 57th Street suite filled with New Alliance affiliates, for which he said he pays $600 a month for rent. He uses party-related lawyers without paying a fee.
 
Different Tactics
 Mr. Sharpton says he does not agree with all New Alliance stands for, like its emphasis on third-party politics, but was attracted by admiration for Ms. Fulani. He says he views his relationship with the group as an opportunity to broaden his base.
Thanks to Ms. Fulani, he said, he is working to tone down his language, particularly the word "faggot," which he said he uses to refer not to homosexuals but to "people without backbones." Although he has been accused of courting anti-Semitic sentiments during racial disturbances this summer in Crown Heights, he argued that he acted as a moderator, meeting with Mayor Dinkins when others in the streets were opposed and telling youths that they could not shout statements like "Heil Hitler!" at demonstrations.
But has he really changed?
In reflecting on some of his past comments, he said, "I think a lot of that rhetoric was things I had to grow out of." Then he paused and added, "In a lot of ways, I have a lot of the same sentiments, but I would express them in a different way."

HEADLINE: Federal Auditors Report Rise In Abuses in Medical Billing

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 19

 BODY:
At a time when Medicare and private health insurers are struggling to control medical bills, many doctors and hospitals are increasing their income by improperly manipulating the numerical codes used to describe their services on insurance claims and billing forms, Federal investigators say.
Federal auditors say the techniques are often illegal and clearly violate the intent of Federal rules for the payment of doctors' services under Medicare. 
 The Government has collected millions of dollars in civil penalties and restitution from doctors and hospitals, including a $1.5 million recovery announced just today in Pennsylvania.
The Government and private insurers say that doctors' creative billing techniques now add at least several billion dollars a year to the nation's health-care costs.
Alarmed at what they say is a growing pattern of abuse, Federal officials and private insurers have stepped up enforcement efforts, using computers to audit claims in an effort to crack down on doctors and hospitals submitting fraudulent and inflated bills.
Questionable bills, officials say, have most commonly been submitted by surgeons and other specialists who perform diagnostic and other procedures. These specialists, who tend to be the most highly paid members of the medical profession, face cuts in payments for their services under a new Medicare fee schedule that will take effect next month.
 
Fragmentation of a Bill
 With the help of a small army of consultants, doctors and their billing clerks have become adept at selecting codes that increase reimbursement. In one of the more common abuses, clearly forbidden by Federal rules, a doctor bills separately for two or more services that are performed on the same patient at the same time and that are supposed to be reported as a single comprehensive procedure.
For example, instead of a single fee for a total hysterectomy, the doctor might bill separately for four or five procedures. And auditors have found that some doctors charge twice for one of those procedures, removing the fallopian tubes and ovaries -- once on the left side and once on the right side. Fragmentation of a bill in this manner is clearly forbidden and can add $1,000 or $2,000 to the cost of a $3,300 hysterectomy, doctors and insurers say.
Hospitals, struggling to squeeze money out of insured patients to help finance care for the uninsured, have also begun to bill separately for many services once regarded as a single package, especially in the emergency room. The Government has accused many hospitals of filing inaccurate claims for lab tests and X-rays.
To challenge such practices, auditors must penetrate the arcane world of medical coding and billing, and also have deep expertise in medical procedures and terminology. Experts on reimbursement say that amid the vast flow of medical paperwork, it is often difficult to spot abusive billing practices, so most go undetected.
While insurance companies have always worried about the manipulation of billing codes, the Government has only recently begun to combat the problem, amid fresh evidence that more doctors and hospitals are improperly using such techniques to offset cuts in reimbursement under Medicare, Medicaid and private health plans.
A recent Federal investigation in Pennsylvania found improper "unbundling" of medical procedures and similar problems in bills submitted by 20 percent of the 8,000 doctors who filed Medicare claims for surgery. Based on that study, Richard P. Kusserow, inspector general at the Department of Health and Human Services, concluded that "a relatively high percentage of physicians" were improperly manipulating procedure codes for personal profit. He and his staff are now investigating similar practices in 14 other states, including California, Florida, Illinois, Michigan, New York and Ohio.
Thomas R. Owens, president of GMIS, a small company in Malvern, Pa., that audits claims for private insurers and helped conduct the Pennsylvania Medicare study for the Federal Government, said illegitimate practices like fragmentation of bills were adding $5 billion to $6 billion a year to the nation's health-care bill, which came to $666 billion in 1990.
 
A Problem Linked To Economic Law
 Dr. James S. Todd, executive vice president of the American Medical Association, agreed that billing manipulation was a growing problem, but said he did not know how much was legal or illegal.
"The manipulation of procedure codes is purely and simply a method to get adequate reimbursement for what physicians do," he said, adding that it is a law of economics that when reimbursement goes down, such manipulation will increase.
For every service, from a simple office visit to a heart transplant, there is a standard five-digit code, set by the A.M.A. or the Federal Government. The codes listed on an insurance claim affect the amount of money that doctors get from Medicare, Medicaid, Blue Cross and Blue Shield and commercial health insurers.
While the Medicare law does not prescribe a specific method of coding, Federal investigators and Government lawyers say that doctors who bill separately for services provided as a package violate the law because they knew or should have known that Medicare does not allow the practice.
Under Federal law, anyone who submits a false claim under Medicare or Medicaid is subject to a civil penalty of $10,000, plus three times the amount of any damages sustained. The maximum criminal penalty is five years in prison and a fine of $250,000.
 
A Redistribution Of Doctors' Incomes
 The intensifying scrutiny of doctors' billing practices comes after a bitter battle between the Government and the American Medical Association over the new Medicare fee schedule for doctors. A major purpose of the fee schedule is to shift income from specialists like surgeons, radiologists and others who perform highly paid procedures to family doctors and general practitioners who provide basic health care. The unbundling of charges has been observed most often in claims filed by specialists who tended to be the harshest critics of the fee schedule.
Most of the doctors with annual incomes of more than $250,000 are surgeons. Data collected by the medical association show that median income rose 11 percent last year for surgeons, to $200,000, and only 3 percent for family doctors and general practitioners, to $93,000.
The Government estimates that Americans are spending $148 billion on doctors' services this year, including $34 billion through Medicare, the Federal health insurance program for elderly and disabled people, and nearly $8 billion through Medicaid, the health-care program for low-income people.
Dr. P. William Curreri, a surgeon in Mobile, Ala., said insurance companies had shown him "terrible examples" of doctors' improperly unbundling procedures to obtain additional payment. But he said there were "large gray areas" in the rules, so the distinction between fraud, innocent error and shrewd business practice was sometimes unclear.
Dr. Curreri is a member of the Physician Payment Review Commission, created by Congress in 1986 to advise lawmakers on payment of doctors under Medicare.
Mr. Kusserow, the inspector general, said the Government's current screening techniques could detect "only 1 percent of the potential overpayments" that occur because of unbundling. In Pennsylvania, he estimated, "this 'gaming' of codes has resulted in potential overpayments to physicians of $12.2 million in Medicare funds and nearly $700,000 in Medicaid funds annually."
Dr. Robert N. Moyers, president of the Pennsylvania Medical Society, expressed outrage at Mr. Kusserow's report, saying it contains "totally unsubstantiated and invalid allegations."
 
On Consultants And Their Roles
 William S. Tate, a spokesman for Medicode Inc., a Salt Lake City company that advises doctors and insurers on reimbursement, said: "There are a number of consultants running around the country teaching physicians how to game the system, how to jack up their reimbursement through abusive practices. But there are also responsible companies like our own, which show doctors how they can legally obtain more complete and accurate payment for their services."
Some consultants also say doctors sometimes get less money than they are entitled to because they leave the preparation of insurance claims to billing clerks who are inadequately trained.
"Additional reimbursement is warranted in about half the claims we examine closely," said J. Eric Sandhusen, president of Review Associates, a Medicare reimbursement consulting firm in Chicago.
Mr. Sandhusen said his firm works "on a straight commission basis," charging 25 percent of any additional amount that Medicare approves. In its brochure the firm promises to "get maximum payment from Medicare," and it tells doctors, "If we can't get you more money from Medicare, our fee is nothing."
C. Nancy Noonan, vice president of Berman & Associates, a consulting concern in Dayton, Ohio, that advises doctors on reimbursement, said, "There is truly, as in all professions, a small percentage of physicians who are bent on deceiving the system."
But she contended that "less than 5 percent" were intentionally fraudulent, and added: "Many more doctors are accidentally fraudulent. They do not know how to bill for their services. They do not know how to use procedural codes to their advantage, and they pay only $4 to $5 an hour for their billing clerks."

HEADLINE: Job Losses in New York Region Erode 80's Growth

BYLINE: By SARAH BARTLETT

 BODY:
Job losses have been so severe over the last two years in Manhattan that they have completely erased all the private-sector growth of the booming 1980's, according to an annual year-end review by the region's Bureau of Labor Statistics.
There are now fewer private-sector jobs in Manhattan than there were in 1980, with the total back to its 1979 level, according to the figures released by Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the regional commissioner of the bureau. 
 Regionally, the picture is not much prettier. Since employment peaked in early 1989, the loss of 460,000 jobs in the five boroughs and 18 suburban counties in New York and northeastern New Jersey have erased 40 percent of the employment growth that took place in the 1980's. And in some places -- in Brooklyn and in Essex, Union and Passaic Counties in New Jersey -- those losses exceeded the 80's gains.
The region's experience has been far more serious than that of the rest of the country. The 3.6 percent decline in jobs for the 12 months ending in October stands in sharp contrast to the eight-tenths of 1 percent decline nationwide.
"This is the most severe downturn the region has experienced since World War II," said Mr. Ehrenhalt, a longtime observer of the economic scene. "It's clearly not your ordinary, run-of-the-mill recession."
 
Calls for Action
 Employment, particularly, is a closely watched indicator, because for every job that is lost, a second is believed to be wiped out by the spinoff effects of fewer people spending their wages in restaurants and stores in the region.
Mr. Ehrenhalt's gloomy assessment came on a day when an estimated 50,000-plus construction workers marched on City Hall, demanding that the Federal, state and local governments initiate public works projects to help revitalize the dead-in-the-water economy. And it led to renewed calls from political, labor and business leaders for more government investment, though few of those interviewed could agree on the appropriate remedy.
Sally Hernandez-Pinero, Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development, called some of Mr. Ehrenhalt's findings "shocking," but insisted there were some bright spots on the horizon that should also be noted. Wall Street has recovered its profitability and is hiring again, she said. Investors have spent large sums renovating everything from Madison Square Garden to the St. Regis Hotel, and new retailers are taking advantage of cheap rents to establish new beachheads in the city.
"The situation is not universally dismal," she concluded.
Despite his disheartening statistics, even Mr. Ehrenhalt agreed that all is not lost for the city. He noted that the pace of job losses slowed slightly in the second half of the year. And unlike other regions of the country, he said, payroll earnings in the Northeast grew at a slightly faster rate than last year.
He also argued that the layoffs that are now devastating many families represent the necessary reorganizing of industries that will soon return to the forefront of the international economy. "I wouldn't write off New York's ability to come back," Mr. Ehrenhalt said.
Still, there was little else about his year-end review to cheer about. Unlike the economic crunch of the mid-70's, when job losses were heavily concentrated in manufacturing, job losses in this recession have struck all sectors of the economy. Local jobs in government, which increased by an average of 13,400 from 1982 to 1987, declined by 6,000 in the first 10 months of this year.
And even the services industries, which have been among the few to continue to expand, lost jobs this year for the first time in the 16 years that the bureau began collecting comparable data on them. And the only category that has been showing any increase -- health and social services -- is now growing at a much slower pace than previously.
The downturn in Manhattan is particularly serious, Mr. Ehrenhalt said, because it has 28 percent of all the jobs in the New York-northeastern New Jersey region. And those jobs are much higher-paying, generating 37 percent of the region's payroll earnings.
Given Manhattan's prime role as an engine for the regional economy, it is not surprising that the suburbs have suffered so badly in this recession. When the last downturn hit in 1981, Long Island and the New York City suburbs continued to grow despite the city's setbacks.
But this time around, Long Island is having its worst job losses in four decades, thanks in large part to layoffs in the defense industry. Westchester, Rockland, Putnam and Orange Counties have also suffered losses over the last two years, compared with the slight growth in employment they managed to eke out from the fall of 1981 to early 1983. And northern New Jersey has been particularly hard hit in this recession, with almost half the region's losses in manufacturing taking place in that area.
In Connecticut, jobs are down 8.7 percent in Fairfield County, 8.6 percent in New Haven County and 5.7 percent in Litchfield County.
The severity of the region's downturn, Mr. Ehrenhalt said, is not captured by the unemployment rate, which, at 6.9 percent is still lower than during any of the last three economic slumps. He explained this seeming inconsistency by noting that the labor force is shrinking because of long-term demographic changes.
Fewer women and young people are entering the work force, in addition to the many people who have simply given up looking for jobs. In the last year the regional work force has declined by about 100,000. Some of that shrinkage may reflect those people simply leaving the region, a trend that the bureau of labor statistics does not keep track of. But a recent New York Times Poll found that 50 percent of city residents who were interviewed indicated that they were making plans to leave the area eventually.

HEADLINE: U.S. Urges Focus on Hard-Core Drug Users

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 19

 BODY:
With cocaine and heroin use rising again, Federal officials said today that more effort in the drug war must be focused on such hard-core users as high school dropouts and the unemployed.
But they said they did not foresee a major shift by the Bush Administration from its current policy of spending 70 percent of its anti-drug budget on law enforcement. 
 "When we have asked for money from Congress for more treatment we have not gotten it," Louis W. Sullivan, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, said in at a news conference with other officials at his headquarters.
He referred to a request for $150 million in treatment and education for the inner cities, an extremely small addition to the $11.6 billion anti-drug budget the Administration requested and Congress endorsed this year.
The increases in the use of cocaine and heroin shown in a national survey and a compilation of hospital reports that were made public today and Wednesday represented the first setback in several years of declining drug use. But Administration officials said that even with these increases, drug use in America was still lower now than in 1989. The biggest gains, the new reports show, have been in the middle class.
"As drug use goes down," said Bob Martinez, director of National Drug Control Policy, "it becomes harder to make progress because what is left are those who are most resistent to anti-drug messages."
The Administration takes credit for the middle-class improvement, but many drug experts say that much of the decline has resulted from people seeing first hand what damage drugs can do and from a national trend toward healthier living.
Administration officials said people without jobs were among the heaviest drug users. But they insisted that the ailing economy should not be blamed for increasing casualties in the war against drugs.
"I don't believe that unemployment causes drug use," said Bruce M. Carnes, an aide to Mr. Martinez. "I do think that people who use drugs can't keep their jobs."
The officials said indications that drug use among teen-agers was continuing to decline, though at a slower pace than previously, reassured them that the anti-drug message was getting across. But the surveys also suggested that something was going wrong with anti-drug education because the percentage of people who think taking drugs is risky or harmful has been falling. Three years ago, 84.9 percent of the population thought taking drugs was dangerous. This year the percentage had dropped to 80.6.
Mr. Martinez, the chief White House official in the effort to curb drug abuse, said the survey and the hospital reports indicated that the drug problem was increasingly centered in the inner cities and among minorities. He called this "the hard-core front," but said the hard core also included many Americans who are now 35 years of age or over and who have been using drugs for years.
 
Statistics on Cocaine Use
 According to the survey by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, which critics say tends to understate the extent of the drug problem, 1.9 million Americans acknowledged using cocaine this year, compared with 1.6 million last year and 2.9 million in 1988. Cocaine use grew in the over-35 group but remained about the same for the younger group, with the exception of teen-agers and young adults, among whom drug use declined slightly.
The reports from the hospitals, which are recorded quarterly, showed a sharp increase in the number of people seeking help in emergency rooms for reactions to cocaine in the first and second quarters of this year, after holding steady for the previous three quarters. The number seeking help after taking heroin also increased in the first half of this year after declining in the last three months of 1990.
"Students have heard and responded to our message to stop using drugs," Dr. Sullivan said, "but the tougher job of reaching dropouts, the unemployed and other special populations remains."

HEADLINE: Leader of North Korea Denies Atom Arms Plan

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PYONGYANG, North Korea, Dec. 19

 BODY:
Despite Western reports that his nation is only a year away from making an atomic bomb, the North Korean leader, Kim Il Sung, denied anew today that the country intended to make nuclear weapons and proposed conditions for allowing inspection of North Korea's nuclear research center.
In a conversation with a visiting American Congressman, Mr. Kim was reported to have said: 
 "We understand very well that we don't have nuclear weapons. And we are not intending to produce nuclear weapons. We have no capacity to produce nuclear weapons, nor do we have money for that purpose.
"And if we produce some nuclear weapons, they would be useless as far as we are concerned."
Mr. Kim's remarks were relayed by Representative Stephen J. Solarz, Democrat of Brooklyn and chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs. He had met with Mr. Kim and other North Korean officials to discuss the nuclear issues, which have become a topic of increasing concern in recent months with Western intelligence reports that the Pyongyang Government is as little as a year away from building an atomic bomb.
 
Solarz Not Reassured
 Mr. Solarz said he was far from assured by Mr. Kim's denials, given what he called "incontrovertible" Western intelligence about North Korea's activities.
In the talks, the North Korean side offered to sign an agreement allowing inspection of its nuclear installations once it gets firm assurances that American nuclear weapons are being withdrawn from South Korea, Mr. Solarz said.
The Pyongyang leaders were reported to have insisted that the North Korean inspections occur simultaneously with inspections of South Korean military bases where American nuclear weapons had been kept. The South Korean President, Roh Tae Woo, announced this week that his country was now nuclear-free, meaning that all American atomic weapons had been withdrawn.
North Korea was also said to have demanded that talks over carrying out the inspections in South Korea be discussed primarily with the United States, not the Government in Seoul, which it has long refused to recognize as legitimate.
Both the United States and South Korea are considered likely to reject such a demand.
 
Threats of Attack
 The United States has said North Korea's seeming plans to become a nuclear power constituted the region's biggest threat to stability, and tensions have risen over threats in South Korea of a pre-emptive strike against the North Korean nuclear plant and counter-threats in Pyongyang that this would lead to war.
A breakthrough seemed to occur last week when North and South Korea signed a treaty of reconciliation and non-aggression, saying they would halt their mutual vilification and try to establish economic ties, communication lines and other links.
But the treaty did not address the nuclear issue, and most experts say that unless progress is made on that, the two sides are unlikely to carry out their other pledges in a significant way. Mr. Solarz's visit to the North Korean capital, which is normally barred to Americans, marked the first time an American official had held formal discussions with North Korea since the furor over the nuclear program arose in recent months.
It was also the first time anyone from the West had discussed the nuclear matter with Mr. Kim.
 
Inspections Had Been Promised
 Until now, the nuclear issue had been raised by Japan and South Korea, which have tried to persuade Pyongyang to fulfill an earlier pledge to sign an agreement allowing inspections of its nuclear installations by the International Atomic Energy Agency.
That signing was scheduled to occur in Brussels in September, but at the last minute North Korea backed away, saying the United States would first have to remove its nuclear weapons from South Korea.
Subsequently, American officials indicated that such a step would be taken, and President Roh announced on Wednesday that it had been completed.
All along, the North Koreans had maintained that their country was not producing a nuclear bomb. Indeed, Mr. Solarz said Mr. Kim and others repeated the contention here while agreeing to discuss the issue of inspection and verification.
Mr. Solarz said Mr. Kim had spoken vigorously and looked healthy. There had been some reports that he has been ailing.
The Congressman said he was far from assured by North Korean statements, adding that the United States had "incontrovertible" evidence from satellite photographs that North Korea was developing a bomb.

HEADLINE: BUSH ASSERTS TRIP IS SEARCH FOR JOBS

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 19

 BODY:
President Bush sought today to portray an impending trip to Japan and the Pacific as a crusade to boost American exports and the economy, saying he intended during the 12-day tour to "relentlessly pursue our mission to create jobs and restore prosperity."
The remarks, similar to previous statements, were widely seen as a political response to criticism of his handling of the economy. But they took on added significance amid reports that Japanese leaders were dismayed by the White House's depiction of the visit as a campaign to pressure Japan into lowering trade barriers. 
 Shortly after meeting with American executives who will accompany him to Asia, Mr. Bush told journalists he would insist while overseas "that our trading partners provide U.S. companies with the same kind of opportunities that their firms enjoy here."
The Japanese leaders' unhappiness centers on Mr. Bush's decision to bring more than 20 American business executives on the trip, including the chiefs of Detroit's three major automakers, as a symbol of American insistence on freer access to Asian markets. Some Japanese officials were said to believe the executives' presence would generate a backlash among Japanese citizens, who increasingly regard the United States as a declining power whose complaints are rooted in envy of Tokyo's economic might.
 
Acknowledging 'Concern'
 Japan's embassy today acknowledged "a general concern" among officials that the American executives will turn what was a state visit into "a business mission," but did not specifically oppose the plan.
"The basic position is that it is up to the President whom he brings," Hiroshi Hirabayashi, the embassy's deputy chief of mission, said in an interview. Japan hopes that the visit will lead to a better understanding of trade frictions between the two nations, he said.
Those frictions have prompted Congressional anger over the American trade deficit with Japan, which has stayed at nearly $50 billion a year even as deficits with other countries have shrunk. Democrats plan to announce on Friday a measure that would restrict Japanese car imports unless the trade deficit with Japan narrows.
 
Shielding Markets?
 In an interview today, Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher said any Japanese reluctance over a visit by American executives appeared to reflect Tokyo's desire to shield its domestic markets from competition.
"I don't blame them," he said. "Why would they want to change something that's working so well for them?"
Mr. Mosbacher, who first suggested that the executives accompany the President on the trip, said he hoped the "more thoughtful" critics in Japan would "realize that they have a system that's different -- not a free and open trading system -- and if they want to join the rest of the world, they have to change."
One of the executives who met with Mr. Bush today, the Chrysler Corporation chairman Lee A. Iacocca, expressed a similar view.
"All we're doing is trying to sit down, government-to-government now, and business-to-business, and say, 'There's something basically unfair,' " he said. "We have to discuss what are the fundamental structural issues keeping us from getting a fair shake."
 
History of Trade Battles
 Washington and Tokyo have sparred in diplomatic circles over trade since the late 1970's, when Japan's successes in critical exports like steel, automobiles and electronics began to make a serious dent in the American trade balance. Japan's refusal to lower barriers to imports has touched off several diplomatic tiffs over trade.
But Mr. Bush has now raised the political stakes in the dispute another notch by making American businessmen unofficial envoys to Tokyo, and including some persistent critics of Japan, like Mr. Iacocca.
The tour of Asia, which will begin on Dec. 30 and include trips to Korea, Singapore and Australia as well as Japan, is the first in which American executives have traveled as a group with the President. That many of them are among the titans of American industry underlines the symbolic importance that the White House has placed on their participation.
Executives invited by President Bush to accompany him on his trip to Asia:

HEADLINE: Trade Deficit Fell Slightly In October

BYLINE: By Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 19

 BODY:
Record exports brought a slight drop in the United States' trade deficit in October, the Government said today, a rare bright spot in an otherwise dark economic outlook.
But further reductions in the trade gap remain a White House priority, and President Bush vowed today to press Japan and other trading partners to open their markets to more United States goods. 
 The Commerce Department said the October deficit fell 2.9 percent, to $6.7 billion, from $6.9 billion in September -- nearly guaranteeing that the shortfall between imports and exports for all of this year will drop to the lowest annual level since 1983.
 
Agenda for Bush's Trip
 Mr. Bush said at a news conference that on his Asian trip in a few weeks he would press Japan and other nations to open their markets to more American exports. The trip, from Dec. 30 to Jan. 10, will take him to Japan, Singapore, Australia and South Korea.
He said the United States has long been one of the world's most open markets, "but our friends and allies have benefited greatly from this and must share the responsibility for an open trading system."
The unexpected improvement in the trade deficit for October virtually insures that the 1991 trade deficit will be the smallest in eight years, the Commerce Secretary, Robert A. Mosbacher, said.
 
One Bright Spot
 The trade report was an unusual piece of good news for an economy suffering increasing layoffs and stagnating production. But the improvement owes much to a decrease in imports by Americans who are curbing their spending as they worry about the economy.
The trade deficit, which measures the excess of imports over exports, was less in October than economists expected.
Exports rose by 3.9 percent to a record $36.7 billion as imports increased 2.8 percent to $43.5 billion, the department said.
But Robert McGee, an economist with Tokai Bank in New York, said the rise in imports at the beginning of the fourth quarter was mainly a result of late orders by merchandisers who held off as long as possible on ordering Christmas merchandise.
 
Goods Piling Up
 "A lot of retailers were ordering more on the assumption of an economic rebound, but we now know that a lot of that just piled up in inventories in subsequent months," Mr. McGee said. "In the next few months, imports will taper off quite a bit."
Mr. Mosbacher said it was now virtually certain the 1991 trade deficit would drop below $70 billion and be the lowest since the $52.4 billion of 1983.
But the trade deficit with Japan has been worsening. It rose to $4.6 billion in October from $4.2 billion in September. The October deficit was the biggest monthly gap since February 1989.

PUTTING THE 80's TO REST, STATISTICALLY
The recession has hit private industry in Manhattan so hard that it has erased all the job growth of the 1980's boom years, the Federal Government announced. Throughout the New York region, the picture is not much prettier. Since employment peaked in early 1989, 40 percent of the 80's job growth has been lost. Underlining the grim news, 50,000 angry construction workers took to the streets, marching across the Brooklyn Bridge to City Hall, where they protested delays in New York City's rebuilding projects that they said have cost them jobs.

KEY RULING ON EVIDENCE
In two notorious cases, one an act of arson in which six firefighters were killed, the other the shooting of police officers by black radicals in the 1970's, the State Court of Appeals broke new legal ground, ruling that a defendant seeking a new trial because the prosecution withheld evidence must demonstrate a reasonable possibility that this failure contributed to the conviction. B3.
 
N.Y.U. MEDICAL CENTER UNDER FIRE
In yet another criticism of the relationship between the city's public hospitals and the private institutions paid to staff them, the State Comptroller cited a variety of instances in which New York University Medical Center failed to comply with the terms of its contract to provide doctors to Bellevue Hospital. B2.
 
BEHOLD, A LIBRARY
At Public School 94 in the north Bronx, English classes are taught in the hallway, the science lab is in an old shower room and the guidance counselor has more than 1,000 students to worry about. But the school did reopen its library this week, nine years after it was closed to make space for a classroom. And that is a major event in a city where most public elementary schools lost their librarians years ago. B3.

HEADLINE: Dow Climbs 6.27 Points in Volatile Trading

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stocks ended a choppy and volatile session yesterday with blue chips modestly higher and secondary issues lower, as investors expressed wariness over the economy and disappointment at the Federal Reserve's delay in lowering interest rates. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 6.27 points to finish at 2,914.36.
Some traders said the erratic trading resulted from buying and selling ahead of today's "triple witching hour," when options on individual stocks, indexes and futures contracts expire. 
 Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was heavy at 199.3 million shares, up from 194.5 million on Wednesday. The Big Board composite declined 0.53, to 210.91, as losers outpaced gaining issues by 1,026 to 693.
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks slipped 0.96, to 382.52, while the American Stock Exchange composite fell 2.12, to 366.60. Trading on the Nasdaq was active as the composite fell 5.31, or nearly a full percentage point, to 534.53, while the Russell 2,000 fell 1.17, to 176.20.
Robert C. Walberg, equity analyst for MMS International, said yesterday's market was pretty much a standard "pre triple-witch" session.
"Most of the weakness displayed yesterday was primarily in the secondary market, with blue-chip issues performing a little better," he said. "The market is showing some strength, in that it has resisted falling sharply on bad news. For example, you had a 3 percent drop in the Tokyo market, weakness in the London market and a larger than expected weekly jobless claim figure."
"Once we get past today, the market should rally through year-end," Mr. Walberg added.
Prices started the day lower as investors continued to worry about the economy, with still no sign that the Fed was planning to lower rates. A bigger than expected rise in the weekly jobless claims and some sell program trading kept the pressure on. Analysts at MMS International said declines in overeseas markets and the lingering effects of General Motors' announced restructuring also dampened sentiment.
Elsewhere in the market, Diagnostics Products, a medical biotechnology company, said yesterday that it expects 1991 earnings to be 5 percent to 7 percent below analysts' estimates. The stock's opening was delayed 50 minutes, and it closed down 14 1/2, to 36 3/8.
Genentech, another biotechnology company, said some analysts were likely to lower their 1992 earnings estimates after the company told them it plans to increase research and development money in 1992, and that in the eyes of some analysts may mean lower earnings, as the stock fell 1 3/4, to 29 3/4.
Boeing stock rose 1/2, to 42 1/2, on news that the company had received $3.1 billion in firm orders for 34 jets.
Time Warner stock, which has lost ground steadily since it was disclosed that its co-chief executive, Steven Ross, was being treated for prostate cancer, was unchanged at 80. Traders said many investors consider Mr. Ross and the company as one, and rumors about his condition have taken a toll. According to analysts, the company sent a memorandum to its employees yesterday indicating that his condition has not deteriorated and that Mr. Ross had completed the first phase of treatment, with doctors encouraged by his progress.
In active trading, Advanced Micro Device hit a new high of 17 1/4, before closing up 1 3/4, to 16 3/4, as several analysts raised their earnings estimates or repeated buy ratings after the company said Wednesday that its fourth-quarter results are expected to be above Wall Street expectations.
Traders said Intel shares fell 2 3/8, to 42 1/2, as Goldman, Sachs lowered its earnings estimate on the company.
Nike shares were down in price, as the company expressed optimism that a recent ruling on a trademark dispute with Sideout Sport could be overturned. Nike shares were off 1 1/8 yesterday, finishing at 62 3/4.

Stores See 11th-Hour Slowdown

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
With only five days left before Christmas, retailers' gloomy assessment of their latest sales results has forced them to scale back their already meager expectations for the critical selling season. While merchants are hoping for a last-minute flurry of shoppers, many are now conceding that sales will be even worse than they feared.
"Time is running out," said Kenneth A. Macke, chairman and chief executive of the Dayton Hudson Corporation, the Minneapolis department and discount store chain. Mr. Macke said he still expected a burst of activity this weekend, but added, "The big question is whether there will be a big enough pickup to make up for the disappointment of the first couple of weeks" of the season. 
 The answer already seems disheartening because in some instances sales have slowed rather than picked up since Thanksgiving. Retailers attribute the 11th-hour slowdown to the unrelenting stream of grim economic news, most recently the announcement by General Motors on Tuesday that it plans to close 21 plants and eliminate more than 70,000 jobs.
 
Elation 'Short-Lived'
 W. R. Howell, chairman and chief executive of the J. C. Penney Company, said he had been upbeat after a good November and brisk business over the Thanksgiving weekend. "Our elation was short-lived," he said. "We have scaled down our expectations." He, too, said December would be slower than most retailers had planned for.
Dayton Hudson, parent company of Target Stores, also said sales had been slower than expected. Mr. Macke said sales at the company's Mervyn's stores in the West dropped surprisingly sharply last weekend, compared with a year earlier. Sales at stores in California, Nevada and Arizona fell more than 10 percent.
"We had forecast softness, but not to that degree," Mr. Macke said.
Some merchants, scrutinizing the latest dismal results from the field, are trying last-minute tinkering, hoping to spur sales. To compete with a rash of bargain-priced videotapes at video stores and fast-food restaurants, Sears, Roebuck & Company recently cut the price of its "E.T." videotape to $9.99 from $14.99.
 
New Macy Promotion
 R. H. Macy, which earlier this week said Christmas sales were weaker than expected, ran newspaper advertisements complete with clip-out coupons offering an extra 10 or 15 percent off jewelry, housewares and clothing -- many of which are already on sale for half price.
A&S, a Federated Department Stores unit, kept its stores open until midnight for a sale this week.
Bargains remain a high priority for shoppers. Myles Jacob, the owner of two clothing stores in Minneapolis, said shoppers seemed more interested in getting a good price than in finding a specific gift. "People buy Christmas presents like they buy a stock," he said. "They buy it when they think it is a good deal."
Still, as is the case every Christmas, there are a few hot-selling items, including a $179.99 combination pool, table-tennis and glide hockey Tournament Table by Fisher Price, which has sold out at most toy retailers.
"For the last two months, I have spent most of my time talking to manufacturers trying to get more merchandise," said W. John Devine, chairman and chief executive of Children's Palace/Child World Inc., a discount toy retailer. "We could have done 10 percent more business if we had more product." Manufacturers, expecting reduced sales, produced a lot less this year, he said.
 
Inventory in Warehouses
 But Mr. Macke of Dayton Hudson and other retailers say lack of inventory is not the problem, and outside retail experts agree. Isaac Lagnado, president of Tactical Retail Solutions, a retail consulting firm in New York, said suppliers' warehouses were filled with goods ready to be shipped.
But for the most part, retailers said there was little they could do but wait and hope that customers begin spending.
"We're hoping the last four or five days will pull us out," said James D. Gundell, general manager of the Bloomingdale's flagship store on Lexington Avenue at 59th Street. But, he added, in a common refrain, "We're running somewhat behind plan."
Many retailers count on Christmas sales for up to half of their profits.
Retailers and some industry experts still expect a burst of shoppers this weekend as consumers stop holding out for further price cuts. "A lot of people have been playing chicken with retailers and the retailer has blinked," Mr. Lagnado said. "Now it's the 12th round and the customers will blink."
For the most part, practical gifts like quilts, tools and kitchen appliances are selling well.
"Who would have thought about towels as a big gift item," Mr. Howell of J. C. Penney said.
 
Other Strong Sellers
 Mr. Lagnado said other strong sellers included the Little Mermaid dolls, Sega video games, Nerf Bow and Arrows and two hardy perennials, Barbie dolls and the Monopoly game.
"It's a lot of basic-type merchandise," said Jane Arend, a spokeswoman for Wal-Mart Stores Inc.
The problem does not seem to be that people are staying at home. For instance, Sears said that more than 300,000 children had had their picture taken with a poster of "E.T."
Not all retailers had bleak reports. Louis Connelly, a spokeswoman for the K Mart Corporation, said that sales were "running nicely ahead of last year."
Wal-Mart Stores has continued to outstrip the competition, and some specialty stores with distinct images, like the Gap and Crate & Barrel, have also stood out.
Gordon Segal, president of Crate & Barrel, a chain of home furnishing stores based in Chicago, said business had picked up this week, after a slow November. Last weekend, people were waiting in line to get into the company's store on Michigan Avenue, Chicago's main shopping street.
Some retail consultants are concerned that if the last-minute sales burst does materialize, stores that have been stingy hiring extra sales help will not be able to cope.
Mr. Lagnado, the retail consultant, said some retailers had made a mistake by skimping on hiring. "People are going to walk away" if they are forced to wait for help, he said.

HEADLINE: CENSUS REFLECTS RESTLESS NATION

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 19

 BODY:
Nearly half of the population of the United States, historically one of the world's most restless nations, moved from one home to another from 1985 to 1989, with about 18 percent of the nation's households pulling up stakes in 1989 alone, according to the most recent data from the Federal Census Bureau.
In nearly three decades from 1960 to 1989, more than 91 percent of the nation's households had moved, the new report said. 
 But the long-term trends indicate that mobility in American society, which has fluctuated over the years along with economic factors like housing costs and interest rates, has slowly declined in the four decades since 1948, when slightly more than 20 percent of Americans moved annually.
Demographers said they expected the steady downturn in mobility rates to continue, at least in the short run, thanks in part to the current recession and in part to the fact that the percentage of Americans in their 20's and 30's -- the age group most likely to move -- is smaller than at any time since the Census Bureau began keeping statistics on mobility in 1948.
"We are moving considerably less in the 1950's," said Larry Long, a Census Bureau demographer.
"Our moving rates were consistently high in the 1950's, then they drifted downward and reached a low point in the early 1980's, when interest rates were so high and mobility rates fell below 17 percent," Mr. Long said. At the end of the recessions of the early 1980's, he said, pent-up desires produced a sudden rush to the moving vans, and the annual mobility rate shot up to 20 percent in 1985.
Since then, the annual moving rates have continued their slow long-term decline.
The West, with its rapidly expanding population, remained the most mobile section of the country, with about one-quarter of its population leaving one dwelling for another in 1989. But in the West, as elsewhere in the country, the vast majority of moves were made within a community or metropolitan area.
The South, where 19.8 percent of all housing units were occupied by new movers in 1989, the year of the survey, was the second most restless area of the country. In the Midwest, movers represented 16.2 percent of all householders; in the Northeast, only about 12 percent of households had moved in 1989.
The restlessness of the American people was noted as early as 1840 by the French historian Alexis de Tocqueville, who wrote, "An American will build a house in which to pass his old age and sell it before the roof is on; he will plant a garden and rent it just as the trees are coming into bearing."
In the United States today, "the population seems to have divided itself into movers and stayers," said Julie Davanzo, a senior economist at RAND, a research organization in Santa Monica, Calif. "Once you've moved once, you're more likely to move again.
"Migration is so much higher in the West because a lot of people have moved to the West and because people who have moved before are more likely to move again -- they are an inherently more mobile group."
Nationwide, renters, who tend to be younger families, were more than four times as likely to have moved in 1989 than homeowners. Nationally, 36.4 percent of renters had moved within the year, compared to 7.7 percent of homeowners.
Since blacks and Hispanic people, who have lower average incomes than the population at large, are disproportionately represented among renters, they are also more likely than white families to be on the move, the Census Bureau report said.
"Where people are more likely to rent, they are more inclined to move," said Jeanne M. Woodward, the author of the report. "Higher mobility rates of blacks reflect the fact they more commonly rent their housing units." About 57 percent of black households live in rented quarters, compared to 33 percent of white households; about 22 percent of black households moved in the survey year, compared to 17 percent of white households.
The survey, which was based on a smaple of 49,400 housing units in 878 counties and cities around the country, also found that among homeowners, the more educated and more affluent were the most likely to move frequently.

In Praise of G.M., If Not of Its Stock

BYLINE: By Adam Bryant

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
MOST automotive analysts agree that the sweeping retrenchment announced by the General Motors Corporation on Wednesday was long overdue, a necessary move to streamline the company's unwieldy operations to match its diminished share of the vehicle market.
But the analysts are divided on G.M.'s common stock, which is trading around its four-year low. Some advise selling the stock, out of fear that among other things the dividend may be cut again. Others urge investors to buy G.M. shares, predicting that the stock is unlikely to drop much more. 
 The announcement had little impact on the stock's price on Wednesday, because Wall Street had largely taken the restructuring into account earlier. A week before, G.M. officials had signaled that cutbacks were coming, giving credence to the rumors that had been sweeping Wall Street and pushing down the price. "The market had a week to digest," said Maryann N. Keller, an automotive analyst with Furman Selz in New York.
Although the stock was actively traded on Wednesday, prices fluctuated little after Robert C. Stempel, G.M.'s chairman, announced the changes at a news conference. But G.M.'s common shares fell again yesterday, reaching a new recent low of $26.875, down 87.5 cents.
With the question about potential cutbacks now answered -- 21 plants to be closed and more than 70,000 jobs to be eliminated over the next few years -- other questions remain that cloud the near-term outlook for G.M..
For one, it is unclear whether the company will lower its quarterly dividend of 40 cents a share again in the new year. After slicing the payout last February, from 75 cents, Mr. Stempel said the world's largest auto maker would not cut its dividend again before considering other actions.
 But Ronald A. Glantz, a Dean Witter analyst in San Francisco, said the United Automobile Workers union would want G.M. investors to share in the sacrifices, along with G.M. hourly workers, before the round of contract bargaining scheduled for 1993.
Mr. Stempel said G.M. would cut capital spending, but Mr. Glantz suggested that it might be prudent to cut the dividend for roughly 18 months to signal to the work force and to investors that the company "is not going to slash capital spending in an effort to appease Wall Street." Because a dividend cut would likely depress the stock, Mr. Glantz is maintaining his "sell" recommendation.
In coming months, credit rating agencies will also decide whether to lower the rating on G.M. debt securities, which would raise G.M.'s borrowing costs. Ms. Keller said the threat of such action would "put a lid on the stock." She declined to predict whether G.M.'s reduction plans were sufficient to stave off a downgrade. She is maintaining her "hold" recommendation on the stock.
 Another school of thought holds that the bad news about G.M. is over, and that the stock represents a buying opportunity. "The bad news is all out," said Stephen J. Girsky, an analyst with Paine Webber in New York, who has upgraded his recommendation to attractive, from neutral.
With G.M. removing more than 15 percent of its capacity, the industry as a whole will be operating, when consumer demand returns, at capacity levels not seen since the late 1970's. Mr. Girsky said many investors he spoke with yesterday were skeptical about investing in G.M.; some were doubtful that G.M. would follow through on its plans, and others thought American auto sales would never return to their previous levels.
Jack V. Kirnan, an analyst with Kidder, Peabody in New York, said that because expectations were so low, there was little risk in buying the stock now, which he is recommending. He says he thinks that the price will go no lower than $25 a share and that it may rise to $40 in a year.
"When the sun comes out, G.M. is going to be an inherently more profitable enterprise," he said. Mr. Kirnan also thinks that Americans may start linking their political views to their shopping lists, and will start test-driving more American cars than they have in recent years.
Jean-Claude Gruet of UBS Securities in New York is also recommending the stock. He noted that although consumer confidence was dismal -- a problem that will likely be made worse by G.M.'s cutbacks -- positive year-to-year auto sales comparisons may soon emerge, given the slump earlier this year. G.M.'s retrenching, combined with gains in market share for some of its new models, are behind his "buy" recommendation, for investors who have the patience to wait for the auto industry to turn up. When it does, he said, the stock will respond quickly.
Scott F. Merlis of Morgan Stanley likened the stock's future course to a bungee jump, saying it would snap back strongly once auto sales start to improve. Mr. Merlis recommends that investors hold the stock for the short-term, but considers it an attractive long-term investment.
"Although we are very concerned about the new downshift in the economy, and vehicle sales, G.M.'s ongoing effort to go lean will mean a lot of upside when the consumer comes back," he said.

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims Surged At Start of December

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 19

 BODY:
In a sign of deepening job-market distress, first-time claims for state unemployment insurance leaped 79,000 in the week ended Dec. 7 to match the highest level since March, the Labor Department reported today.
The increase, to 493,000, was markedly greater than most analysts had expected and tended to support predictions that the December jobless rate, to be reported on Jan. 3, will hit 7 percent after standing at 6.8 percent in October and November. 
 "Things are deteriorating," declared Alan C. Lerner, a senior economist at the Bankers Trust Company, also noting that the number of people collecting benefits under state programs jumped 763,100 in the week ended Nov. 30, to 3,546,100.
 
Holidays Are a Factor
 Before seasonal adjustment, initial claims totaled 613,500 for the Dec. 7 week, up 176,800 from the preceding week, when the Thanksgiving holiday closed unemployment offices and cut applications.
While the initial-claims figure is widely watched as a sign of what is to come -- it is one of the 11 components of the Government's index of leading indicators -- it is prone to erratic week-to-week swings, particularly around holidays. This has caused analysts to favor a four-week average in evaluating claims figures.
On this basis, the latest reading is 449,000, the same as in the preceding period. This was because the Dec. 7 level of 493,000 was exactly the same as reported for the week ended Nov. 9, which happened to be the highest since the recessionary depths of last March. In March, claims briefly soared to 540,000, the most in more than eight years.
Separately, the October trade figures from the Commerce Department provided a rare bit of upbeat economic news, showing that American companies exported a record $36.7 billion of merchandise that month, $1.4 billion more than in September. Imports rose a sizable $1.2 billion, which some analysts said was more likely a sign of delayed ordering of holiday goods than an indication of a rebounding domestic economy. Over all, the trade deficit for October was $6.7 billion, down slightly from September's $6.9 billion. [Page D4.]
 
Worries About Jobs
 The jobless-claims figures, which gauge the number of newly unemployed, had been expected to rise after their drop of 61,000 in the Thanksgiving week. But the increase of 79,000 was roughly twice as much as the consensus forecast. Besides pointing to a rise in the December unemployment rate, which is based on a survey conducted during the week ended Dec. 14, the data add to evidence that the economy may be contracting in the fourth quarter.
Yet the Federal Reserve continued to refrain from beginning another round of interest-rate cuts, puzzling many specialists.
"The numbers are pretty per suasive," said Michael W. Keran, chief economist for the Prudential Insurance Company. But he also noted that while consumers, politicians and many business people were decidedly pessimistic about the economy, the financial markets seemed more confident. Mr. Keran noted, for example, that not only was the stock market holding up, but also junk bonds were performing well and the spreads were narrowing between returns on investment-grade securities of differing qualities.
Yesterday, partly in response to the jobless numbers, long-term interest rates fell to their lowest level in more than four years.
These developments argue against those who foresee an extended deterioration of the economy that would seriously impair prospects for profits and debt coverage.
 
California Tops List
 The claims report showed that the states with the biggest increases for the Dec. 7 week were California, with 30,863 who had lost jobs, followed by North Carolina (19,714), Illinois (19,317) and Pennsylvania (16,018). The biggest decline was Wisconsin's, at 8,828, with Texas a distant second, down 2,840.
New York and New Jersey each had claims rise by about 7,250, with New Jersey citing big layoffs in air-conditioning factories and casinos.
Today's report also showed that 635,000 people filed claims during the Nov. 30 week for extended benefits under the recently enacted emergency compensation program, which provides up to 20 weeks of additional benefits to those who have already exhausted 26 weeks of benefits.
 
A Jobless Rate Is Up
 The seasonally adjusted rate of insured unemployment rose to 3.3 percent from 2.9 percent in the Nov. 30 week. This reflected 3,477,000 people collecting benefits, 419,000 higher than in the preceding week's seasonally adjusted revised level of 3,058,000.
The 10 states with the highest insured unemployment rates were Alaska, Vermont, Oregon, California, Rhode Island, Washington, Maine, Idaho, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Puerto Rico's was 7.6 percent, slightly higher than Alaska's 7.5 percent.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
New Camel Agency Defends 'Smooth Character' Image

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
THE advertising industry's two most-talked-about executives are finally talking about their new account.
In October, John L. Mezzina and William G. Brown Jr. stunned their colleagues. The R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company unexpectedly moved the creative portion of its $40 million Camel cigarette account from Young & Rubicam New York, which the two men had left two months earlier, to Mezzina/Brown Inc., their small start-up agency. 
 With the account's transition almost completed, the men agreed to an interview, their first since landing the account, at their office on Manhattan's new Madison Avenue, Park Avenue South. The other day, as workers painted and remodeled the 18,000 square feet of space being occupied by Mezzina/Brown's 40 employees -- including about a dozen who, like Mr. Mezzina and Mr. Brown had worked on Camel at Y.& R. -- the executives discussed the surprising events of recent weeks.
"We had hopes Reynolds would be interested in doing business with us when we were out on our own," Mr. Brown, the agency's president, said, sitting behind a desk in a still sparsely furnished office.
"Did we think it would be of the magnitude it turned out to be?" he asked. "Probably not."
Yet not only is the Camel account large, it is perhaps the most reviled advertising in America today. Attacks on the brand's "Smooth character" campaign, developed in 1988 -- a year before the account came to Y.& R. -- continue unabated.
Only last week, the Journal of the American Medical Association singled out the campaign, and its Joe Camel cartoon caricature, for blistering criticism. A coalition of antismoking and health groups, charging that the ads actually appeal more to children than adults, demanded they be banned.
Mr. Brown staunchly defended the campaign. It is "terrific," he said, "and it is working." Echoing Reynolds, he and Mr. Mezzina insisted the ads are aimed solely at adult smokers.
"We are not targeting kids," Mr. Mezzina, the agency's chairman and executive creative director, said as he smoked a Camel. "We are playing this according to Hoyle."
Mr. Brown added, "There are 50 million people out there who already smoke, and 48 million do not smoke Camel. We've got a huge market to target out there without bringing in under-age smokers."
Mezzina/Brown is producing Camel advertising, the executives said, though none of it has yet appeared. It will continue in the "Smooth character" vein, they added.
Mr. Brown compared Joe Camel to other "illustrious spokes-characters" like the Pink Panther, which appears in ads for Owens-Corning insulation, and the Jolly Green Giant.
"It's highly unlikely kids run out to buy vegetables because the Jolly Green Giant suggests their stuff is great," he said.
Working on a campaign "that's particularly high-profile makes your job more difficult, clearly," Mr. Mezzina said. "I hope people would not think we're tainted because we're associated with something controversial," he added.
That is of particular concern because Mezzina/Brown intends to seek additional clients "as soon as it's practical," Mr. Brown said. But because "Camel is so huge and multifaceted," he added, "it may be a few more months before we can get involved in pitching other accounts."
Reynolds's decision to shift the Camel account "was in no way a reflection on Y.& R.," said David N. Iauco, the company's senior vice president of marketing, because the giant agency "was doing a good job."
But, he added, after Mr. Mezzina and Mr. Brown left Young & Rubicam, "the opportunity to retain the leadership team on the brand was an attractive option."
Discussing their move, Mr. Brown said: "At some point in most people's advertising careers, you think about going out on your own. When you hit your early 40's" -- he is 43; Mr. Mezzina is 42 -- "it's time to take destiny into your own hands."
The executives disputed suggestions that Reynolds hired them simply because it is cheaper for a small agency to handle such a huge account.
"Certainly there are economic advantages" for Reynolds, Mr. Brown said. "But Camel is one of their flagship brands. No matter what the financial advantages are, there's no way in the world they would put it into the hands of those who couldn't meet the tough marketing challenge."
And that "is easier for a small agency," Mr. Mezzina said, "because what tends to happen in any large organization is that the falcon can't hear the falconer."

HEADLINE: Washington Talk;
Bad Year, Good Decade for the Rich

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 19

 BODY:
Representative Thomas J. Downey has done as much as anyone in recent years to advance the Democrats' case that the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer. So eyebrows were raised today when the Long Island Democrat released a study that seemed to weaken part of his case.
The very richest Americans were the ones who seemed to get poorer in 1989, losing almost 10 percent of their income, the study showed, while the incomes of most other Americans stayed the same and the poor showed a modest gain. 
 Mr. Downey was quick to note that the trend affected only the top 1 percent of Americans -- movie stars and corporate chiefs -- and to argue that the findings signaled no real reversal in what he called the trend toward greater income inequality.
He almost dared Republicans to make an issue out of it. "There's an interesting dilemma for them," he said. "To recognize this drop in the incomes of the very rich, they'd have to recognize the huge past gains."
While Mr. Downey's critics did not seize the moment to call for bailouts of Donald Trump, some did suggest that there just may have been some grandstanding in the Democrats' past statements about windfalls for the very wealthy. Since sample sizes of this group are always small, the critics say, they give way to large statistical fluctuations.
"Probably earlier impressions were exaggerated," said Marvin Kosters, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington research group, in a reference to the bandwagon the Democrats tried to get rolling on the tables in last year's Green Book, a House Ways and Means Committee compilation of social welfare statistics.
Last year's tables showed that from 1977-1988, the incomes of the richest 1 percent rose by 96 percent. Today's updated figures downgrade that rise, though they still show a hefty 78 percent gain from 1977 to 1989.
Economists were puzzled over the numbers, which were computed by the Congressional Budget Office and made public by the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources, which Mr. Downey heads. They cover 1988 to 1989, the period before the recession's official arrival.
Perhaps they show the recession hit the richest first. Perhaps they reflect the downturn in real estate and banking. Perhaps they involve some kind of delayed reaction to 1986 tax changes. Perhaps the budget office made a mathematical error.
"I haven't a clue," said Henry Aaron, an economist at the Brookings Institution, another research center.
The figures showed that in 1989 the pre-tax incomes for the top 1 percent of American families fell by about $57,000 -- to $560,000 from $617,000. The change was adjusted for inflation and expressed in projected 1992 dollars.
After-tax incomes for those families also fell at similar rates, dropping to $410,000, down from $451,000 a year earlier.
Information from the budget office, not contained in the Ways and Means report, indicated that the 1989 reductions for the very richest came mostly because of drops in salaries and other earned income. Rough approximations showed that 60 percent of the drop was from labor income and 40 percent from reduced capital income.
But no one challenged Mr. Downey's assertion that the past decade's trend has been toward greater income inequality. From 1977 to 1989, today's study showed, the poorest fifth of American families saw their incomes drop by more than 10 percent, to $8,391, while the incomes of the richest fifth grew by more than 25 percent, to $109,424.
"I agree there's been greater income inequality for individuals over that period, and for families," said Mr. Kosters. But he said he thought that some Democrats had exaggerated its extent, and its causes. Part of the reason for the growing inequality is demographic rather than economic, he argued. Richer Americans often belong to families in which both the husband and wife work, he said, while poorer American families are increasingly headed by a single woman.
Further, Mr. Kosters argues, the trend may reverse itself. Seeing the economic benefits of a good education, he said, more poor people may seek one, and seeing the low costs of unskilled workers, more employers might seek them out and train them.
But he cautioned that today's data did nothing either to support or contradict that theory. Statistically, not politically speaking, "the evidence is too weak to say, one way or the other," he said.

HEADLINE: Idle, Angry Hard Hats Tell Off City Hall

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
Fifty thousand angry construction workers took to the streets yesterday, marching across the Brooklyn Bridge to City Hall, where they protested delays in the city's rebuilding projects that they said have cost them jobs.
Waving American flags and chanting "Prime the pump!" the union members called on city, state, and Federal officials to increase capital spending programs to help revive their ailing industry. 
 Industry and union officials who spoke at the City Hall Park rally that followed said more than half of the city's 90,000 construction workers are currently unemployed, and cited 10 major capital spending projects stalled by bureaucratic delays in recent years that could have generated at least 15,000 jobs.
"We came together to send a message that this region is close to a depression and that it's time to stop planning projects which have been stalled for years, and actually start building them," said Louis Colleti, president and chief executive of the New York Building Congress, an umbrella group representing contractors and labor unions.
 
Hard Hats and Boots
 The officials said that the rally had closed down virtually all construction projects involving union workers in New York City yesterday because all union workers had agreed to give up a day's pay to draw attention to the construction industry's problems.
The police estimated that 50,000 people, many clad in hard hats and boots, attended the rally. In a rare alliance, representatives from management, engineering, design and civic groups also took part in the rally.
As speakers addressed the rally, the construction workers, many carrying signs reading "Rebuild America," often broke into chants of "We want jobs! We want jobs!" that were followed by screams, yells and clapping.
The protesters closed the westbound lane of the Brooklyn Bridge and Broadway and Chambers Streets for several hours yesterday, but the police said that there was no disorderly conduct.
Among the stalled rebuilding projects the speakers cited were the relocation of the old Miller Highway south of 56th Street, where Westway was supposed to go, a new West Side waterfront park from Battery Park to midtown, full financing of the Metropolitan Transit Authority's capital plan, a third water tunnel, the Ellis Island International Conference Center and a new headquarters for the Commodities Exchange, at the World Trade Center.
 
Delays in Awarding Contracts
 Last year, the city's Environmental Protection Department failed to let more than $600 million in budgeted contracts to repair sewers and water mains, delays that the department attributed to a shift in offices, changes in procurement rules and holdups in supporting services by other city agencies. Construction officials and other aides to Mayor David N. Dinkins said the slow progress would cost the city both millions of dollars in extra work and a chance to stimulate the sluggish local economy.
Vincent DiLuci, an unemployed electrician from Brooklyn who marched in the rally, said that he had been without work for 10 months and had recently applied for public assistance to feed his wife and three children. "I'm doing all I can to find work, and now I learn that there's work available but the city won't award contracts," Mr. DeLuci said. "Now that's depressing."
John Cardinal O'Connor, whose civic and charitable activities the construction industry has long supported financially, told the protesters that he had come to the rally to express his "personal support and belief in organized labor." Referring to political leaders, the Cardinal said: "We need their help and support to get people working again. We need a plan, and we need a plan now, and we need it put into action now."
Responding to the protesters outside his office windows yesterday, Mayor Dinkins said in a statement that he shared their frustration, and he called on the President to finance an "anti-recessionary" agenda to put people back to work. "Obviously a single Mayor in a single city cannot jump-start the nation's economy," Mr. Dinkins said.
Mr. Coletti of the building congress agreed with Mr. Dinkins and called for the establishment of a national infrastructure fund that would finance the rebuilding of the nation's roads, bridges, highways and schools.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
Another Top Manager Is Leaving Salomon

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD

 BODY:
The stream of departures continued at Salomon Brothers yesterday, as the firm announced that Jay F. Higgins, a vice chairman and one of the only remaining members of Salomon's prior senior management, would resign at the end of the year.
The departure of Mr. Higgins, who founded the firm's mergers and acquisitions department and served as the head of investment banking, had been expected. But his decision marks the highest-level defection since November, when Stanley B. Shopkorn, the head of the equities division and one of Salomon's most aggressive traders, said he would leave at the end of the year. 
 Salomon has been struggling to keep its executives since the Treasuries market scandal began to unfold in August. Since then, virtually all of the firm's former management, including John H. Gutfreund, the chairman, were either asked to resign or chose to leave as the changes at the firm made their future roles less certain.
Rumors of Mr. Higgins's departure began to circulate last month after the announcement of a large management shake-up. Deryck C. Maughan, who was named chief operating officer in August, recast the firm's management structure, eliminating the executive committee that had run the firm and replacing it with his own new committee of managers. Mr. Higgins, who was named to the executive committee during Mr. Gutfreund's tenure, was not appointed to the new committee.
In an interview Mr. Higgins, 47 years old, said he had long planned to leave, even before the Treasuries market scandal began to rock the firm. "I have been thinking for a while that I would be doing something else in 1992," Mr. Higgins said, adding that he had no specific plans. "I wish these guys nothing but the best. They are doing a difficult job, and I think they are doing a spectacular job."
Salomon executives have been wary of possible departures after the end of the year, when executives will have their bonuses and all participants in a three-year, $120 million deferred compensation plan will receive their share of the pool.
Mr. Higgins has played an important role in the firm since the Treasuries market scandal began to unfold. After the World Bank, the bluest of Salomon's blue-chip clients, suspended business with the firm, Mr. Higgins maintained contact with the bank and worked aggressively at preserving the firm's relationship with the international lending agency, as well as at regaining its business.
Mr. Higgins joined the firm's corporate finance department in 1969, after receiving his undergraduate degree from Princeton University and his master's degree in business administration from the University of Chicago. In 1978, he founded the mergers and acquisitions department, and he was named a general partner one year later. In 1986, he was named the head of corporate finance, and and he became head of investment banking in 1987. He assumed his latest job in 1988.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Germany's Rate Increases Cause Losses for the Dollar

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Battered by a rise in German interest rates, the dollar fell against most major currencies yesterday.
Gold prices were mixed, falling in New York after rising overseas. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, the dollar fell $1.80, closing at $357.20 an ounce. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $357.50, off $1.30. 
 The German mark, strengthened by a half-percentage point increase in two important interest rates, was the standout on the foreign exchange markets.
Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, raised its discount rate to a record 8 percent and also increased the Lombard rate, the interest charge to banks using securities as collateral, to 9.75 percent.
An increase in German rates supports the mark -- and in turn undermines other currencies, including the dollar -- because higher yields make German investments more attractive.
The dollar tumbled more than 2 pfennigs, falling to 1.5575 marks in New York, from 1.5715 late Wednesday. In earlier German trading, the dollar fell to 1.5595 marks from 1.5730, and the mark also rose against other currencies.
John McCarthy, chief foreign exchange dealer with ABN-AMRO Bank N.V. in New York, said comments by German officials in support of a stronger mark also weakened the dollar.
The dollar was also hurt by expectations of a further decrease in United States interest rates. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to push the discount rate below its current level of 4 1/2 percent in hopes of reviving the economy.
Another drop in American rates will make United States investments even less competitive in the face of higher yields overseas.
Mr. McCarthy predicted the dollar would continue to decline.
"Pressure looks to be on the dollar in the very short term," he said.
The dollar fell to 128.15 yen, from 128.35 in late New York trading Wednesday. In Tokyo overnight, the dollar rose 0.28 yen to close at 128.70 yen.
The British pound rose to $1.8365 from $1.8290. In London, the pound rose to $1.8330 from $1.8253.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday's prices, included 1.3805 Swiss francs, down from 1.3925; 5.3255 French francs, down from 5.3700; 1,180.25 Italian lire, down from 1,187.00, and 1.1565 Canadian dollars, up from 1.14695.

Prices for Heating Oil Drop To Lowest Level in 6 Months

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Oil traders ignored freezing temperatures yesterday and pushed home heating oil futures to the lowest price since June.
"You'd think people were frolicking on the beach, the prices we're seeing," said Peter Beutel, an oil analyst with the Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J. 
 Heating oil for January delivery settled at 53.46 cents a gallon, down 1.26 cents, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Heating oil for next-month delivery has not been that low since June 13, when the final price was 53.44 cents a gallon.
 
Crude Oil, Gasoline Off, Too
 Light, sweet crude oil for January settled at $19.13 a barrel, down 26 cents. Unleaded gasoline for January settled at 53.57 cents a gallon, down 0.65 cent.
Even though oil prices had been falling lately, traders were surprised by the sharpness of the plunge in heating oil.
"You're near the year's low on heating oil, and you're in a cold spell in the Northeast," said Victor Yu, vice president of futures for the Nikkhah Energy Group. "It does not say much about the rallying strength of this market."
Heating oil supplies are greater than demand, analysts said, largely because the weather in the Northeast has been mild for much of the fall.
"There's just a lot of inventories that need to be worked off," Mr. Yu said. The American Petroleum Institute reported this week that the nation's ample supply of heating oil was rising.
The rest of the energy futures were sold off in the afternoon, despite a rally in the morning on the news that the United States, Britain and France might seek to boycott Libyan oil in retaliation for the terrorist bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. The Western nations contend that Libyan agents were responsible for the bombing.
Reports of a Texas refinery fire kept gasoline futures from falling as far as the crude oil and heating oil contracts, Mr. Yu said.
Natural gas prices for January took another tumble, falling 5.7 cents to settle at $1.708 for 1,000 cubic feet. Natural gas has fallen 16.5 cents in five straight losing sessions.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Will Recession Revive Unions?

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
WILL this stubborn recession, which the White House now concedes is continuing, further weaken the American labor movement? Or will the slump revive it?
History does not provide an answer. On the contrary, it shows that hard times can have a double, and contradictory, effect on organized labor. On one side, falling sales and profits, plant closings, business failures, layoffs and the fear of unemployment undermine labor's bargaining power and ability to organize. But, on the other side, a serious and prolonged slump also provides a challenge to attack problems of poverty and unemployment, and may revive the spirit and drive of the unions -- as happened in the 1930's Depression. 
 The election of Ron Carey, the crusading head of a United Parcel Service local in Queens, as president of the teamsters' union indicates that the spirit of union democracy and the struggle for the best interests of rank-and-file workers are indeed reviving in a union known for the corruption and violence of its leadership.
But one such victory -- and one that is far from complete -- does not mean that the war is won. It will be a continuing struggle to re-establish organized labor as an effective check and balance to the powers of corporate management -- a point made by George P. Shultz and described last week in this column. Mr. Shultz, a former Secretary of State, Secretary of Labor and president of Bechtel Group Inc., sees a free labor movement as vital to a free and healthy society.
"The worst thing that can happen in a good labor-management relationship," Mr. Shultz recently told the National Planning Association, "is for people to start valuing it too highly and elevate its importance above getting problems resolved." When either management or labor is afraid to press the other on critical issues for fear of spoiling their relationship, he said, "the relationship is inevitably going to go down hill because it isn't serving the interests of the people."
But how can organized labor regain its vigor and its role as an effective check and balance to management?
In response to that question, Owen Bieber, president of the United Automobile Workers, expressed optimism: "While we've taken our lumps, we haven't lost our vision or our vigor. Nor are we without resources. We have a job to do. I share with my colleagues in the A.F.L.-C.I.O. -- including, I might add, teamster president Ron Carey -- a genuine enthusiasm for doing that job."
Mr. Bieber reformulated the question as, "What's needed to insure that our contribution continues?"
And then he answered it this way: "We need changes in American labor laws, which have been tilted against the very working people they were written to protect. We need to restrain the buccaneer employers who employ permanent strikebreakers. Why? Because they severely tilt the bargaining and organizing process in favor of the least responsible employers. And we need to revisit the issue of overall labor law reform in the 1990's to insure a neutral climate for organizing."
The aim of overhauling the labor laws to clear the way for union organizing goes back to the New Deal. The rapid growth of unions in the Depression took place under the protective arm of the Federal Government and the Supreme Court, which found the National Labor Relations Act to be constitutional. The act affirmed the right of labor to organize and bargain collectively with employers.
"We've had just about every imaginable obstacle thrown at us in the last decade or so," Mr. Bieber said.
But that could reverse. If the present recession continues or worsens in the months before the November 1992 election, there could be a radical improvement in the political climate for labor organizing, as there was when Franklin D. Roosvelt defeated Herbert Hoover in 1932.
However, the growth of union membership during the Depression was not just because of political forces; it was also spurred by the newly formed Congress of Industrial Organizations and by the hot competition between the C.I.O. and the American Federation of Labor for members. A. H. Raskin, who for many years was the chief labor correspondent of The New York Times, feels that the most important requirement for a revival of the labor movement today is "commitment" -- the commitment of labor leaders to rank-and-file members and to the jobless, poor and unorganized. "Everything would stem from that commitment," Mr. Raskin said.
Changes in technology and the skill requirements of workers, the shift from goods to services, the changing demography of the labor force, intensifying global competition and the failures of the unions to adapt to these changes -- all these help to explain the linked trends of declining union membership, stagnating wages and declining productivity growth. Labor and management both need to take a new look at their relationship and their common objectives, with the focus on how to get productivity growing again.

From Silver Boom Town to Celebrity Playground

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:

Whiteout
Lost in Aspen
By Ted Conover
269 pages. Random House. $20.
Having previously explored the precarious worlds of railroad hobos ("Rolling Nowhere") and illegal aliens from Mexico ("Coyotes"), the journalist Ted Conover now turns to the other end of the social spectrum in his latest book, "Whiteout: Lost in Aspen." His subject is Aspen, the glittering ski resort and celebrity enclave in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. The underlying theme, however, is similar to that explored in his earlier books: the promise and betrayal of the American Dream. 
 As Mr. Conover writes, Aspen was originally a quiet valley where the Ute Indians spent their summers. The discovery of silver there quickly transformed it into a boom town in the 1880's; the boom ended abruptly in 1893, when the price of silver plummeted on world markets, and the town's economy collapsed. By the late 1930's, as the skiing industry was just getting started in the United States, Aspen boasted a meager population of 600 or 700.
Among the new visitors to Aspen at this time was the American businessman Walter Paepcke. He belonged to the Chicago world of high-thinking idealists who included the philosopher Mortimer Adler; Robert M. Hutchins, the University of Chicago president, and the Bauhaus designer Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, and he came up with a visionary plan for turning Aspen into a sort of high-culture resort. After helping to stage the Goethe Bicentennial Festival in Aspen in 1949, Paepcke and his wife, Elizabeth, set about institutionalizing what they had achieved. The result was the think tank known as the Aspen Institute.
"One of the strange ironies of Aspen," Mr. Conover writes, "is that even among those who continue to love the town, there is a constant discussion of when Aspen began to go downhill and whether it now is ruined. This discussion usually takes as a narrative model the Book of Genesis, with Paradise created fresh in the late 40's and 50's and Innocence lost gradually ever since. Walter and Elizabeth Paepcke are like Adam and Eve, the first in the Garden, and greedheads from the outside world play the Serpent. It is a battle of good and evil for the soul of Aspen."
According to Mr. Conover, some older Aspenites date the decline of their town to the paving of Independence Pass, a mountain road, which allowed easier access. Others point to the legalization of condominium ownership, which opened the way for more buildings and more people. Later arrivals in town cite the opening of a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant in 1973, and the construction of the Ritz Carlton Hotel, started in 1988.
In any case, Aspen's "Paepckeinspired air of utopian possibility" became a magnet in the 1960's and 70's for hippies, counterculture types and people intent on shedding their pasts and reinventing themselves. "It was a young place, sufficiently in flux to have a sense of alternatives about it," Mr. Conover writes. "It was in the mountains, far from cities and repressive childhoods, but close to nature. Commerce seemed something the town was not about -- Babbitt lived far away. Small was beautiful, Aspen was both, and the young flocked to it."
As Mr. Conover sees it, different aspects of Aspen's appeal were summed up by two of its most famous citizens: while Hunter S. Thompson, the gonzo journalist, became a kind of "unpaid advertisement for bohemian Aspen, a call for freaks and rebels," the presence of John Denver "seemed to pave the way for seekers, for nature lovers, for spiritualists, for flower children." Other celebrities -- including Jill St. John, Jimmy Buffett, George Hamilton, Jack Nicholson, Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell, Robert Wagner, and Sally Field -- took houses in the town as well. By the 80's, says Mr. Conover, Aspen had become "a great celebrity laboratory."
From his vantage point as a cabdriver and later as a reporter for the local paper, The Aspen Times, Mr. Conover gives the reader a selection of entertaining anecdotes about famous and not-so-famous Aspenites. He introduces Jon, owner of the local "disco cab" -- a taxi equipped with a mirrored ball, black light, a fog machine and two musical keyboards; Cynthia, a self-proclaimed U.F.O. abductee, who says things like, "We've hugged in a previous life, am I right?," and a new-age guru named Diamond, who asserts that illness "is not accidental," that "there are no accidents." In addition, he recounts his own comical attempts to crash Don Johnson's Christmas party, survive a new-age retreat weekend and make it through Barbi Benton's annual pajama party.
This lively book leaves the reader amused and a little disgusted with the excesses of Aspen. Mr. Conover seems to have focused on the town's more colorful and more outrageous aspects, and Aspen comes across as a collection of weirdos, nuts, conspicuous consumers, self-indulgent partygoers and aging narcissists. It's the sort of place where people of both sexes wear full-length fur coats and Day-Glo bodysuits, the sort of place where the average house costs more than $1 million and the average worker is forced to commute.
Mr. Conover grew up in Colorado (though far away from the glitter of Aspen), and by making himself a character in his story -- much the way he did in "Coyotes" -- he avoids appearing as a judgmental outsider. Much of this book, in fact, chronicles his own seduction by Aspen: in the course of two years, we see him go from being an impoverished cabdriver, scrambling to make ends meet, to being an Aspen insider, impatient with the unhip world that lies beyond the town. Indeed, his own loss of innocence becomes a kind of metaphor for Aspen's own precipitous tumble from grace.

A Star at Raphael
Some enticing Provencal food is being stirred up at Restaurant Raphael, 33 West 54th Street in Manhattan. The new chef is Jean-Michel Bergougnoux, who ran the kitchen at the three-star Le Cygne until it closed last summer. His dinner menu carries beguilements like a wonderful combination of salmon glazed with periwinkle juice and dill ($20), loin of rabbit with bacon and braised endive ($22) and sirloin steak with a red wine sauce and bone marrow, and a gratin of salsify, fava beans and prosciutto ($24). 
 A recent lunch started with a harmonious confit of sliced eggplant layered with slices of warm lamb and goat cheese ($8.50). Also alluring was a salad of perfectly sauteed skate with capers ($8).
Among main courses, an earthy assembly is the pan-seared cod fillet with cabbage and a sesame oil vinaigrette ($17). When the weather is cold, a highly recommended dish is braised aiguillette of beef, a sinewy but extremely flavorful cut, served with its juices and a confit of carrots ($19). Finally there is the Provencal specialty brandade de morue, to which Mr. Bergougnoux gives rough texture and splendid flavor by blending pieces of cod with potatoes and serving with a dark beefy sauce ($7.50).
Restaurant Raphael serves lunch noon to 2:30 P.M. Monday to Friday, dinner 6 to 10 P.M. Monday to Friday, until 11 P.M. Saturday. All major credit cards accepted. Telephone: (212) 582-8993.
 
The Changing Scene
 CLOSED: Harvey's Chelsea House, the 102-year-old restaurant at 108 West 18th Street in Manhattan, but perhaps temporarily. Dick Harvey, the owner for 16 years, said that taxes, insurance and utility costs, compounded by the bad economy, had forced him to close.
He is considering seeking investors or a partner. "If I can't come up with something soon, I'll have to sell or declare bankruptcy," he said.

HEADLINE: How to Win Friends and Influence Culture

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:
"MEMBERSHIP was the foam on the wave of enthusiasm for the arts," says Jan E. Adlmann, assistant director for external affairs at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. "And the wave has subsided."
Mr. Adlmann's fanciful metaphor underscored some tough facts. Faced with spending cuts by city, state and Federal governments and by recession-pinched corporations, New York City's cultural institutions are running hard just to stay in place. Increasingly, they are turning to their grass-roots base: the thousands of members who, year in and year out, contribute $25, $1,000 or $250,000 to help keep the doors open at institutions ranging from the Bronx Zoo to Fraunces Tavern, from powerhouses like the Metropolitan Opera to boutique-size operations like the New York City Fire Museum. 
 "All membership people are much more under the gun than in the mid-80's," Mr. Adlmann said. "In the 90's, American museums across the board will see a greater enlargement of development staff, which includes membership, than any other department."
Membership directors tend to use words like "family" and "love" when speaking of their supporters. In a cold economic climate, they thrive on the heartwarming gesture, the unanticipated donation, the membership upgrade. And no season cheers quite like Christmas, when, says Marilyn Shapiro, head of marketing and development for the Metropolitan Opera, "people generally take stock of their giving."
The city's cultural institutions usually give excellent value for money. Nearly all of them offer benefits packages geared to particular levels of monetary support, usually starting with a basic membership in the $25-to-$75 range (with discounts for students and the elderly) and moving up to big-bucks categories with honorific designations like patron, special friend, star and angel.
Typically, a basic membership includes free admission, a discount at the museum store, a monthly events calendar and fliers about special events. At the Museum of Modern Art, for example, a basic individual membership buys unlimited free admission to the museum (normally $7), as well as a 10 percent discount at the museum's three stores.
And all over town, there's evidence of fancy footwork at the base-membership level. The Museo del Barrio offers free admission to the art museum in Ponce, Puerto Rico. The Asia Society gives discounts at selected Asian restaurants in New York, while the New York Botanical Garden offers discounts at selected nurseries and garden centers. The Museum of American Folk Art offers a limited $15 "Quilt Connection" category for people interested solely in quilts. The International Center of Photography, with a truly shrewd eye, promises members that an expert will review their portfolios.
The greater the contribution, the greater the privileges. A few hundred dollars at a blue-chip museum buys invitations to special viewings or rehearsals, special classes and seminars, and free guest admissions. At institutions in Manhattan off Museum Mile, or in other boroughs, the donor's dollar goes further: $500 can buy a listing in programs or the annual report; at the Brooklyn Museum, $5,000 lands a private tea and personal exhibition tour with the director.
At $1,000, which development officers regard as the benchmark of serious philanthropy, the benefits come showering down, usually in the form of recognition (one's name printed in the annual report or on programs, for example), invitations to black-tie galas and special previews, and access to the curatorial staff, performers and artists. More money brings entry into brass-plaque territory. Top-level donors ($1,000 and up) at the Whitney Museum of American Art can borrow a work of art from the museum's permanent collection to hang in their homes for the length of their membership.
Gradations can be as finely tuned as the seating plan for dinner at Versailles. At the Brooklyn Academy of Music, $500 a year buys your name on a plaque plate affixed to a mezzanine seat in the academy's Opera House; $1,000 moves you into the orchestra seats. At the Metropolitan Museum of Art, "we reserve access to curators for the upper, upper level, starting at $2,000," said Barbara Dougherty, membership manager.
 
Selling the Institution
 Most membership directors insist that they're selling the institution, not benefits. Nevertheless, "members of a certain category are very aware of their benefits and complain when they don't get them," Ms. Dougherty said. And the benefit just out of reach can rankle. Hell hath no fury like a sustaining member who finds that $300 does not buy a drink at the Temple of Dendur.
The care and feeding of members is an unrelenting obsession. "We surveyed our membership in September, found out some interesting things and are revising our benefits mix accordingly," said William Y. Fellenberg, director of membership at the Museum of Modern Art. "They expressed a growing interest in behind-the-scenes activities related to exhibitions. In response to this, the membership department conducts a variety of talks led by artists and curators."
The Metropolitan Museum found that its members objected to crowded previews (which have since been increased in number to thin out the crowds) and wanted a clearer presentation of information in the monthly calendar. (It was redesigned, and members were surveyed for their reactions.)
The challenge for development officers is to persuade one-year members to renew and basic members to trade up to more expensive membership categories, each with a tempting inducement. The mutual benefit increases geometrically at higher levels, where institutions can offer prestige and recognition at low cost. That means more money for the institution and a bigger tax deduction for the donor, since taxpayers cannot write off the market value of benefits.
"You structure those special events throughout the year as you see fit," said Jerome A. Kleinman, director of development for the New York Philharmonic. He added that while he cannot promise members "a cup of coffee with Maestro Masur," he can deliver members of the orchestra in small gatherings.
Part of the science of membership development is deciding how to price the product. "You're going to raise your fees every couple of years," said Ms. Dougherty of the Metropolitan Museum. "We did it on July 1, 1990, from 14 to 33 percent, depending on the category. Membership dropped off 6 percent, but income grew 8 percent." The Guggenheim Museum, which is preparing to open its doors again in May after a two-year renovation program, will raise its fees dramatically on Jan. 1 but is offering its members a chance to renew or upgrade at the old prices before the New Year.
 
Satisfied Customers
 Worrying about numbers is endemic to the trade. Four times a year, New York's Membership Group for Cultural Institutions meets to discuss topics like the tax deductibility of membership, the pros and cons of direct mail, and effective lobbying for more lenient post-office regulations. The spirit of cooperation carries over into the real world, it seems, since the Brooklyn Botanic Garden shares its mailing lists with the New York Botanical Garden, for the obvious reason: "Exchanging is cheaper than renting a list," says Bella Podesta, director of membership at the Bronx garden.
The pressure is on to keep members happy but not spend money, to keep the cost of membership overhead at 30 percent of donations. More and more, organizations are offering members the option of waiving certain benefits, like free museum publications, if they would prefer to see the cost of the benefit go directly to the institution. The Metropolitan Museum, for example, asks members in the $300-and-up categories if they would like to pick up their publications themselves, thereby saving the museum the cost of postage.
Without members, of course, none of the frantic cost-cutting will make any difference. After steady growth in the early and mid-80's, cultural institutions have faced two years of flat membership, even as prices have risen. The crunch has come, and development officers who contend that they are not losing members do so with a note of triumph.
By the way, Richard Gere, the Jacques Marchais Center of Tibetan Art on Staten Island has a message for you: your membership has lapsed; please renew.
 
HERE'S WHERE TO GIVE AND WHAT YOU'LL GET
 Here is a sampling of cultural institutions in New York City with membership programs, giving mailing addresses and highlights. Most institutions offer students and the elderly a discount on the base membership price. All of them gratefully accept contributions of any amount from nonmembers. Another way to help is to buy gifts at museum shops, some of which offer extra discounts during the holidays.

HEADLINE: TV Weekend;
Making The Best Of Slim Pickings

BYLINE: By JOHN J. O'CONNOR

 BODY:
Curious habit: The closer television gets to Christmas, the stingier it gets with original programming. Most weekly series have segued into repeats, and an inordinate number of holiday specials are, ahem, "classics" from decades past. Finding something requires an effort, but persistence can be rewarded, however modestly. These are this weekend's more promising entries:
"THE YEAR IN ROCK: 1991"(MTV), tonight at 9). The predictable blitz of fleeting images, overseen by the hosts Tabitha Soren and Kurt Loder, is used to catalogue a year that, on the whole, was troubling. With the recession trickling down to the music industry, sales of recordings and concert tickets were off considerably, leaving a good many top names playing before embarrassingly empty halls and stadiums. MTV was clearly less impressed than George Bush with the Persian Gulf War, obviously preferring the "Give Peace a Chance" protesters. Performers from Paula Abdul to Rick James got entangled in unseemly legal situations. But, gamely optimistic, MTV also looks at some brighter sides. Hot new artists: Nirvana, Marky Mark, Seal, Color Me Badd, Naughty by Nature. Breakthroughs: Metallica, the Black Crowes, Extreme, Chris Isaak. Most encouraging pop-culture development: more film releases by black film makers than in the previous five years combined. Short on analysis, this MTV image collection, punctuated with brief blasts of music, is almost dizzyingly comprehensive. 
 "THE WISH THAT CHANGED CHRISTMAS" (CBS, tonight at 8:30). Based on the Rumer Godden book "The Story of Holly and Ivy," this animated program was produced for McDonald's -- officially it's a "Ronald McDonald Family Theater" presentation -- by a Children's Television Workshop subsidiary and Colossal Pictures. Little Ivy, an orphan, spends Christmas Eve looking for a grandmother and a Christmas doll. Far be it from me to reveal the outcome. Providing a couple of the more prominent voices are Paul Winfield and Jonathan Winters. The animation is creaky and the story is treacly (under 9's would seem to be the targeted audience) but, at the breaks, Ronald the clown spiritedly encourages his young viewers to explore the range of books available to them at libraries. That effort is admirable, assuming the libraries still haven't been closed because of budget cutbacks.
"TRIBUTE TO ELTON JOHN AND BERNIE TAUPIN" (ABC, tomorrow at 9 P.M.). With Sylvester Stallone introducing them, performers honoring the songwriting team will include Sting, Tina Turner, George Michael, Sinead O'Connor, Phil Collins, the Who, the Beach Boys and Eric Clapton. Mr. John himself joins Mr. Michael for "Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me." A collage of Mr. John singing "Your Song" down through the years provides a nifty fashion review of his unfailingly eye-catching hats.
"AMAZING GRACE" (Channel 13, tonight at 9). If you insist on picking one rerun this weekend, this should be it. Produced by Bill Moyers, the 90-minute program traces the story of "Amazing Grace" since it was written in the 18th century by an English minister named John Newton. Truly amazing has been the hymn's extraordinary impact on singers and listeners. Renditions are offered here by, among others, Jessye Norman, Judy Collins, Johnny Cash and the gospel singer Marion Williams, who notes simply that "it's a song that gets to the heart of men." How sweet it is, indeed.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Visit to Gorbachev

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
Mikhail Gorbachev is talking in his Kremlin chambers talking courteously, gracefully and forcefully for an hour about himself and his country, mustering the strength to act as if his life, power and nation were not shattering around him.
He also acts as if he does not know that he has bitter enemies who are waiting for him to leave the Kremlin's protection, some of them waiting in prison. But of course he must know. 
 He says important things that he has not said before except to his intimates. He says he has accepted the verdict of the people and the republics that a commonwealth -- not a state, not a nation, but a concept -- will replace the country he ruled.
But he wants a role in it; he says he can help. He says he does not believe dark dictatorship will return. But then, he says calmly that authoritarianism may be necessary to prevent destabilization.
As he talks he knows what his visitors do not -- that within a few hours he will sit down with the man who wants to drive him from that suite of offices forever. Boris Yeltsin is coming. It turns out Mr. Yeltsin's message is that all that remains for him is a pension.
Sitting around his table are about 25 Russians, other Europeans, and Americans attending a conference on "The Anatomy of Hatred" -- a title that encompasses xenophobia, racism, anti-Semitism, religious fanaticism. It has been organized by the much-respected magazine Ogonyok and one of the few men for whom Mr. Gorbachev and other holders of high office find time -- Elie Wiesel, Nobel Peace Prize laureate.
Listening to Mr. Gorbachev, I think of somebody not there, a former K.G.B. general who had unexpectedly appeared at the conference. Maj. Gen. Oleg Kalugin gave a little talk on fighting hatred, which coming from any top officer of the K.G.B., present or former or perhaps in between, did not move me, except to slight nausea.
In September the general appeared on the "MacNeil/Lehrer" program. He said something so important that I took a transcript with me to Moscow. There he suddenly was, so I read out a passage in which he said he had "certain reasons" to believe that the K.G.B. "may have something about Mr. Gorbachev, which we do not know yet exactly what" but that might make him "dependent" on the K.G.B. or "vulnerable" to it. The general said one day it might be used against Mr. Gorbachev by the K.G.B. -- particularly by its former chairman, Vladimir Kryuchkov, in a cell awaiting trial as a member of the three-day coup. The general said Mr. Kryuchkov did know exactly what.
The democracy-loving general said he still thought that would happen. His tone was, just wait and see. In any case, the assumption here is that the coup makers, all appointed by Mr. Gorbachev, will not go quietly to life imprisonment without trying to take him along.
Also -- talk is around about Mr. Gorbachev being summoned to testify about scores of billions of dollars in foreign loans or credit that have disappeared. That is not just a threat but a justified legal step that could be blocked only by former Communist politicians of the commonwealth who might not want to be asked too many questions themselves.
But in Mr. Gorbachev's private meeting room -- two nail holes in the wall brocade show where Marx and Lenin recently looked down -- I thought mostly of how warm and courageous he was and how historically important was his decision to try to save the Communist system by opening its windows to a large measure of freedom.
But then, every time I hear myself think that I also hear what political prisoners of the Soviet system say on release -- glad, not grateful. Neither they nor, as it developed, the people ever would be grateful to that suffocating system or to a leader trying to preserve as much of it as he could.
The people felt they had the right to more freedom, and to bread too -- even sausage once in a while. He could not do that within the system and would not abandon it. That is why he is now a pebble in the shoe.
Mr. Gorbachev talked of terrible economic crisis, of growing destabilization. But he talked as if somehow he had nothing to do with it all. His enemies know he did, and are waiting. His friends know that too, but they will try to help him, when he is out of office, at least as long as they can.

HEADLINE: No Mysticism in Oz, Just the Populist Credo

 BODY:
To the Editor:
You report on "The Wizard of Oz as a Secular Myth of America," a paper delivered by Paul Nathanson at the convention of the American Academy of Religion in Kansas City (news article, Nov. 28). Dr. Nathanson, a researcher at McGill University's Center for Medicine, Ethics and Law in Montreal, apparently views "The Wizard of Oz" as a mild blend of religion and mysticism. In fact, the book is a secular political tract firmly based in history and ideology. 
 In 1896, L. Frank Baum was a supporter of the populist William Jennings Bryan in the Presidential campaign against the eventual winner, the Republican William McKinley. The chief issue in that election was the gold standard (tight money, high interest rates) with McKinley for and Bryan opposed since it kept farmers and workers in debt, and made capital scarce for small business.
In his parable, Baum had the Scarecrow (farmer), the Woodsman (worker) and the Cowardly Lion (Bryan) join Dorothy (Everyman) in the trip to Oz, the abbreviation for ounce, the standard measure for gold. Their travel to the Emerald City to free the land of Oz involved passage along the yellow brick road (gold again) and battle with the Wicked Witch (the Eastern banking establishment).
The Emerald City is unmasked as a facade of papier-mache, not a "modern technological metropolis," and the Wizard confesses himself a common man making believe.
Unlike the 1896 election, Baum's tale has a happy ending from his point of view. Dorothy's companions gain character, defeat the Wicked Witch and free Munchkin Village, which is not "an idyllic Midwestern town," but the nation.
But then, Baum would have cheerfully left religious themes to those who seek them.

HEADLINE: New Yorkers Don't Live in Ecological Vacuum

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"What to Do About Water" (editorial, Nov. 19) makes a commendable call for sensible, everyday water conservation measures in New York City. On Nov. 29 you report a major drought is feared as reservoirs hit lows and indirectly show that this call for conservation -- and the city's recent sequence of watch, warning and emergency -- are part of a pattern of response that arrives too little and too late for the watershed region. 
 A chart accompanying the Nov. 29 article shows a documented trend of insufficient rainfall stretching back to the beginning of 1991. Drought conditions were noted in the upstate watershed area early last summer, with many streams and wells running low or dry. Yet the official New York City response to that shortfall was delayed until late September, when the city initiated a drought watch.
This lag comes because downstate drought response is geared to reservoir levels, not natural conditions. Months of intense drought can pass while city officials wait for the prescribed reservoir levels to do anything. The result is that a Catskill resident has long stopped watering his lawn by the time a New Yorker is advised to take shorter showers.
Another result is that upstate residents watch fish kills in the heated waters of lowered reservoirs and see critical downstream water flows curtailed, while urbanites continue regularly to water golf courses and wash cars.
It is difficult for a city to be attuned to an environment that sustains it when that environment is 125 miles away. However, that difficulty is no excuse. Conservation should have begun in New York City months ago. It is both enlightened self-interest and an obligation for New Yorkers to be much more mindful of the impact that their behavior has upon the ecology and economy of their watershed regions.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Says He Will Not Run for President in '92

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Dec. 20

 BODY:
After 10 weeks of tortuous public deliberation that seemed to take him to the brink of candidacy, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo stepped back today and announced that he would not run for President in 1992.
Only two months before the New Hampshire primary, his announcement gave final form to a Democratic field that had been largely overshadowed by Mr. Cuomo's potential entry. Less than 90 minutes before the 5 P.M. filing deadline for the New Hampshire primary, Mr. Cuomo told a crowded news conference in the Capitol that he could not run because of the lack of progress in negotiating a solution to the state's severe fiscal problems. 
 "It seems to me I cannot turn my attention to New Hampshire while this threat hangs over the head of the New Yorkers that I've sworn to put first," said the 59-year-old Governor as his aides looked on grimly.
 
Kept Country Guessing
 Today's announcement by Mr. Cuomo, who spent most of the day closeted in the Executive Mansion, culminated a surreal political odyssey in which the Governor abandoned his claim to have "no plans and no plans to make plans" to run and then kept the country guessing about whether he would.
The scene on the second floor of the State Capitol, where a crush of reporters waited for white smoke from the Executive Mansion, provided a fitting conclusion.
Because Mr. Cuomo acted more and more like a candidate -- he distributed economic position papers and granted extensive interviews while his aides searched for office space and plotted a fund-raising strategy -- most political strategists assumed that he was running. Still, he continued to insist that his major obstacle was a budget solution, even though a solution grew ever more unlikely as the New Hampshire filing deadline approached.
In his four-minute statement and in a lengthy question-and-answer session afterward, Mr. Cuomo said the Republicans who control the State Senate had made it impossible for him to run by stonewalling the budget talks "for their own purposes."
 
Gave G.O.P. a Veto
 Whether the budget really was the only factor blocking Mr. Cuomo's candidacy, the Governor's announcement left many people wondering why he had created a situation in which he seemed to hand the Republicans, through their role in the budget process, a veto over his Presidential ambitions as well.
The state Republican chairman, William D. Powers, said Mr. Cuomo was using the Senate Republicans as scapegoats. "After months of fence-straddling, Cuomo looked in the mirror and realized that he wasn't up to the job of running the country," Mr. Powers said.
Mr. Cuomo said today that he realized he could have skipped the New Hampshire primary, forged a budget solution and then announced for the Presidency. But he said he would follow the request of the Democratic National Committee Chairman, Ronald H. Brown, that he not do so.
"Theoretically, at a point in the future when our gap has been closed and our budget process restored to reasonableness, I could then enter the remaining primaries and still be a contender for the Presidency," said Mr. Cuomo, who is serving his third term as Governor.
"But I accept the judgment of the national chairman of our party that it would be in the best interest of the Democratic Party that I abandon any such effort now so as to avoid whatever inconvenience and disruption to the process is created by the uncertain possibility of another candidacy."
 
'You Don't Get Drafted'
 While Mr. Cuomo did not specifically rule out a potential draft, he said: "You don't get drafted for the Presidency. Whoever wins the primary ought to be the candidate."
Although Mr. Cuomo seemed impassive during his hour-long news conference, he said he regretted not having the chance to run for President. He said there were "a number of excellent candidates" in the Democratic field. And even in announcing that he would not join it, he delivered a vibrant stump speech promoting Democratic alternatives to the Bush Administration's domestic policy.
Mr. Cuomo's announcement seemed to cement the Democratic field at six major candidates -- former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, former Senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts and Gov. Douglas Wilder of Virginia.
All lack the stature and name recognition enjoyed by Mr. Cuomo. But the Governor's decision to withdraw from consideration opened an important new phase of the Democratic campaign, in which one or two of the contenders can escape from Mr. Cuomo's shadow and try to break from the pack in the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 18.
Mr. Cuomo's announcement represented something of a political epiphany, not only for the the Governor, but also for the Democratic Party. It means that the Democrats enter the race against a suddenly vulnerable President Bush without two of their most dynamic leaders -- Mr. Cuomo and the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson.
A Cuomo race against Mr. Bush would have been problematic in many ways, and Republican strategists had boasted that the Governor's vulnerabilities would be easy to exploit. But Mr. Cuomo's formidable political assets, including his intellect and his eloquence, had convinced many Democrats that he was the party's best hope, despite the burdens of his uneven record in New York and his complex and mercurial personality.
 
Kept Family in Suspense
 Mr. Cuomo kept his family, his aides and reporters in suspense until virtually the last possible moment today. Much of the crowd jammed into Room 250 of the State Capitol had no idea what Mr. Cuomo would say when he walked to the lectern at 3:37 P.M., took a long sip of water, slipped on his metal-rimmed glasses, folded his hands and started reading his statement.
The Governor spent the day speaking with political advisers and making a last-ditch effort to negotiate a deal that would close the nearly $5 billion budget gap facing the state in the next 15 months. Cuomo aides said the Governor began to write his statement at about 2 P.M. after his chief of staff, Andrew J. Zambelli, was informed by aides to the Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, Republican of Oyster Bay, L.I., that the latest round of discussions would not produce an agreement.
Mr. Cuomo's political aides had been making preparations for a campaign for weeks, including plans to meet today's filing deadline. Two chartered planes were sitting on the tarmac at Albany County Airport to shuttle Mr. Cuomo and his press corps to Concord, N.H., where he would have paid his $1,000 filing fee and announced his candidacy in front of the New Hampshire Statehouse.
In the event that Mr. Cuomo decided to run but could not make the trip himself because of timing or bad weather, a Cuomo supporter had been sent to Concord in advance with a copy of filing papers that Mr. Cuomo had already signed.
At least temporarily, Mr. Cuomo's announcement ended a political journey that began in 1984, when Mr. Cuomo's stirring keynote speech to the Democratic National Convention transformed him instantly into a potential Presidential candidate.
Even as Mr. Cuomo was passing up his second Presidential race in four years, he was asked whether he would consider running in 1996. "My mother has a wonderful expression -- between now and then a Pope will be born," he said. "It means that everything happens. Ninety-six is an eon away, at least one eon, possibly an eon and a quarter."
Mr. Cuomo was implored to run in the 1988 race by Democratic leaders and gave the race brief consideration before announcing on a radio call-in show in February 1987 that he would not be a candidate. Until a year later, when he definitely ruled out the possibility of a draft, talk continued of a host of "Mario scenarios."
By his own admission, Mr. Cuomo's decision-making process this year was far more complex. He announced somewhat casually at an Oct. 11 meeting of his fund-raising committee that he would "think about" the 1992 race, but then told reporters he had said "absolutely nothing" new.
 
Thinking, Not Acting
 Before long, Mr. Cuomo made it clear he was giving the race serious thought and was being treated as an unannounced candidate.
But Mr. Cuomo insisted from the beginning that he did not feel he could run if he could not craft a resolution to the state's worsening budget problems, although his language varied on what form the solution had to take.
He continued today to resist accusing the Republicans who control the State Senate of deliberately sabotaging his Presidential plans by refusing to reach a budget agreement.
"I'm not going to assume that anybody had perverse motivation," he said. "I'll leave that to God and their conscience."
But he made it clear that he felt the Republicans were obstructing the budget process. "The Republicans have responded to every reasonable offer of compromise with new and predictably unacceptable demands, making it apparent that they believe at least for the moment that their own purposes are best served by pushing the state closer to the brink of disaster," Mr. Cuomo said.
The State Democratic Chairman, John A. Marino, who was directing the planning for a Cuomo campaign, threatened vengeance against the Republicans who, he said, had thwarted Mr. Cuomo. He placed the greatest blame on Ralph Marino, to whom he is not related, and Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the Long Island Republican, who came to Albany this week to denigrate Mr. Cuomo's fiscal abilities. Mr. D'Amato and all legislators face re-election next year.
"I'm going to make sure next November that voters remember what the Republicans did this December," Mr. Marino said. "Al D'Amato will be history. Ralph Marino, a two-bit Republican politician from Nassau County who is Al D'Amato's puppet, and his friends are going to pay a price."
While disappointed New York Democrats sought solace in revenge, national Democratic figures said that Mr. Cuomo's second unconsummated flirtation with a Presidential campaign might leave a bitter political aftertaste.
"If he had wavered and run, people would not have remembered," said Geoffrey Garin, a Washington-based Democratic political consultant who is not aligned with any of his party's candidates. "The only thing people would have remembered would be the candidacy that followed the process. Now all they're left with is the process. And the process was unattractive."

HEADLINE: Beliefs;
Doing Unto Others in Christmas Season

BYLINE: By PETER STEINFELS

 BODY:
It will be a different kind of Christmas for the Cardall family of Salt Lake City. All this week, they have been down in the basement, sorting and packing clothes, shoes, kitchen utensils, blankets and toys donated by friends and neighbors for two orphanages in Mexico.
Today, 10 Cardalls will pile into the big Chevy Beauville van and a pickup truck and begin the 2,500-mile round trip to Chihuahua. 
 "We decided to spend the money we would normally spend for gifts and traditional trappings to pay for gas and motels and food," said Duane Cardall, a correspondent for KSL television news, the CBS affiliate in Salt Lake City. Mr. Cardall and his wife, Margaret, will be making the trip with seven of their eight children and a son-in-law.
Though nobody keeps figures, there are undoubtedly thousands of people like the Cardalls, determined to keep Christmas in their own way regardless of what the culture urges on them. But sure as God made Super Nintendos, such people remain a tiny minority.
Increasing their number is the aim of an organization called Alternatives, founded in 1973 as a protest against the commercialization of Christmas.
It produces videos, posters, Christmas play scripts, inserts for church bulletins, and a book, "To Celebrate," a kind of Whole Earth Catalogue of ideas about keeping holidays in ways that are simpler, serener, truer to their religious character and more concerned about reaching out to the poor and powerless than keeping a list of who is naughty or nice.
There is a danger here of becoming a politically correct Grinch, a Scrooge of altruism.
Alternatives recognizes it, and though it is occasionally guilty of venial earnestness, it steers clear of Puritanical hostility to holiday merriment. Indeed, the problem it assails is that "when Christmas does come, it often finds us spiritually, emotionally and financially exhausted," the joy of the season shadowed with "vague feelings of guilt about misspent energy and resources."
That is from "Whose Birthday Is It, Anyway?" an Aternatives brochure stuffed with family Advent services, small-scale suggestions about gift-giving and lists of charities and self-help crafts groups.
With three full-time and two part-time employees, Alternatives operates out of an old general store in Ellenwood, a hamlet 20 miles south of Atlanta. The nonprofit group was begun by a former civil rights worker, Bob Kochitsky, and now receives support from several Christian denominations.
The sagging economy has been bad for Christmas sales but good for Alternatives. Kathryn Munnell, the organization's director, said she had met a great many people who had wanted to change the commercial emphasis they put on Christmas but did not feel they could do it. "The hard times give them a practical reason," she said.
But what happens when good intentions confront the world of shopping malls, Ninja turtles, adolescent peer pressure and harried adults? Just start with a few telephone numbers of churches, religious orders and individuals who purchased Alternatives' materials. Very quickly one bumps into little dramas of quiet virtue, uncertainty, ambivalence, regret, everything but complacency.
 
'Taking in Strays'
 There is Patti Gatti, a Roman Catholic who teaches a morality course to juniors at Our Lady of Victory girls' high school in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y. Mrs. Gatti, who has been a lifetime member of a Bronx parish, steers her students into working for the homeless and has a weakness, her two children say, for "taking in strays" like an unmarried mother and a student struggling with a drug problem.
Does Mrs. Gatti manage a different kind of Christmas? "I can't honestly say that," she replies.
Richard Stanley is a volunteer, not just at Christmas-time but all year round, at the same Dobbs Ferry project where Mrs. Gatti's students often work, the Midnight Run, an effort by churches and synagogues throughout Westchester to collect food, clothing and blankets for the homeless and distribute them at about midnight three nights a week in New York City. His wife, Patricia, has overseen the packing for the Midnight Run for years, and their son Ben, now 10, has been doing his part since the age of 5.
"The commercial Christmas is not particularly appealing to me," said Mr. Stanley, an assistant chancellor at New York University and a member of St. Barnabas Episcopal Church in Irvington, N.Y. He has talked to relatives "about trying to gear things down a bit" but met a poor reception. "People equate love and strong family feelings with the commercial efforts," he said.
 
Unease on the East Side
 At the Brick Presbyterian Church on Manhattan's East Side recently, a handful of youngsters from fifth to eighth grade intently watched an Alternatives video about Christmas. The video takes up many topics, from the nature of celebration to the impact of the Industrial Revolution and advertising on holidays.
What seized the attention of the students, all enrolled in some of Manhattan's most exclusive private schools, was a brief segment depicting the stress and demoralization that commercial Christmas can produce for poor children and their families.
"It's kind of depressing -- families who don't get anything," said Walter Masterson, an eighth grader. Laura Worth, a seventh grader, added, "I felt spoiled."
But Laura manages to articulate what was clear from the students' faces, that they also felt uneasy. "I know you shouldn't buy as many as we do, but presents are fun," she said. It's a jump from Manhattan's East Side to the old school house in a cornfield near Palmyra, Mich., where the Bertrams live. "The question goes deeper than celebrating an alterntive kind of Christmas," Mary Bertram said. "It's a question of a whole view of how you live."
 
Change After Volunteering
 The Bertrams found their way of living changed when they volunteered to work two years in Costa Rica building houses with Habitat for Humanity. Now Bob Bertram, who resigned from the Roman Catholic priesthood, manages housing loans as an officer of the Farmers Loan Admininstration.
The Bertrams have four children, ages 9, 11, 15 and 16. Gift-giving is important in their household, which combines her Mexican-American heritage with his German-American customs. But the gifts are small ones, often given throughout the 12 days of Christmas, from Dec. 25 to the Jan. 6 Feast of the Epiphany. They include coupons promising personal favors like washing dishes for someone.
The Bertrams' Christmas shopping list usually has around 25 people, relatives and godchildren, Ms. Bertram said, and a budget of about $200. Advent wreath ceremonies add to the liturgies the Bertrams hold weekly in their home all year round.
In October, after much discussion, the family bought a computer system for $1,900. "Was it a Christmas present or not?" Ms. Bertram wonders. She approves of the purchase but can not quite forget that it cost as much as two houses would in Central America.
Since 1986, Beverly Fawcett has been going home to Bethel, Conn., for Christmas from her volunteer work at the Holy Trinity School, run by Episcopalian sisters in Port au Prince, Haiti.
 
Gifts in Earlier Times
 In previous years she has arrived with a Santa's pack full of gifts from Haiti for her four sons and other relatives -- "beautiful things," she said in a tone that practically pulsed with enthusiasm for a troubled nation she has come to love deeply. The gifts were modest but this year, she said, they will not even be that.
Her Christmas expenditures will go instead to assure the graduation of a young woman from a Port au Prince nursing program. Ms. Fawcett's relatives will receive cards with a photograph of the aspiring nurse, Gladys Francois, who grew up in a Port au Prince orphanage and who, Ms. Fawcett said, "glows with happiness and is so thankful in the midst of nothing."
One might think that a 59-year-old woman who had given five years of her life to working in Haiti could assume she had certain prerogatives. "But you feel so guilty if you do anything different," Ms. Fawcett said. "I came home thinking, 'Oh my God, all I've got is these cards.'
"I found myself going to the mall, and then I said, 'Oh nuts, if people are not satisfied with this, that's not my problem.' "

HEADLINE: FED CUTS KEY RATE IT CHARGES BANKS TO A 27-YEAR LOW

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 20

 BODY:
In a bold move to revive the slumping economy, the Federal Reserve chopped its bedrock discount rate today by a full point, to 3 1/2 percent, the lowest level since 1964.
The surprisingly big cut was seen as part of a broad effort to stimulate borrowing and perk up an economy whose signs of recovery from recession have all but vanished. The discount rate is what the Federal Reserve charges on loans to banks but its significance is in the message it carries to the financial markets and businesses and consumers. 
 In addition to cutting the discount rate, the Federal Reserve also signaled today that it had cut a second key interest rate, the Federal funds rate, which banks charge each other on overnight loans. That rate also fell more than expected, by one-half percentage point, to 4 percent, instead of an anticipated one-quarter point.
Taking the cue, the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company quickly slashed its prime lending rate to 6 1/2 percent from 7 1/2 percent, and many other big banks followed, including Citicorp, Chase Manhattan, Chemical, Manufacturers Hanover and First National Bank of Chicago.
Because the prime rate is used as a benchmark for many kinds of borrowing, including home-equity loans and other adjustable rate mortgages, such cuts benefit both consumers and businesses, which widely hailed today's moves.
 
Cheaper Mortgage Expected
 The rate cut is also expected to put some downward pressure on rates for conventional mortgages. If mortgage rates were to drop a quarter point, for example, this would mean the monthly payment on a $200,000 loan would fall by $36. Since January 1991, rates for fixed-rate mortgages have fallen from 10 percent to what John Tuccillo, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors, predicts will be 8 percent by next month, a saving of $288 a month. For an adjustable-rate mortgage, which he expects will fall to 6 percent from 8 1/2 percent over the same period, a borrower would save $338 a month.
Savers, however, will be hurt by today's cut in rates, as banks within days further shrink the interest rates they pay on new certificates of deposit, and yields fall similarly for money market funds.
The bond and stock markets surged today, but the dollar fell in world currency markets as lower interest rates made American investments relatively less attractive.
Describing the discount rate cut, the Fed stated: "The reduction was made on the basis of cumulating evidence, notably monetary and credit conditions, as well as current economic conditions, that point to a receding of inflationary pressures." It said this move, "together with the cumulative effects already in train from previous actions, should provide the basis for a resumption of sustained economic expansion."
The White House has repeatedly urged the Fed to relax monetary policy, and President Bush, whose standing in public opinions has been plummeting over his handling of the economy, called the discount-rate cut "a significant step" that will help to create jobs. "I commend this latest Federal Reserve Board action, which will significantly help our efforts to turn the economy around and get America back to work," he said in a statement.
Democrats in Congress generally welcomed the moves, but several chided the Fed for moving too slowly. "He should have done a point two months ago, three months ago," said Richard A. Gephardt, the House majority leader, referring to the Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan. Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan, head of the Banking Committee, said the action "reflects their anxiety."
A Federal Reserve spokesman said the decision, approved by a 6-to-1 vote, was made at a meeting of the board of governors called on short notice for Thursday evening. One Wall Street specialist said that such sessions were highly unusual and that this one was particularly remarkable in that it came only two days after a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's chief policy-making body.
The discount rate cut was the biggest since December 1981, when the rate dropped to 12 percent from 13 percent. The move carried the rate to a level exactly half that of the 7 percent at which it stood as recently as mid-December 1990.
Time and again over the last year the Fed has cut both its administered discount rate and the overnight private market rate over which it exerts substantial control. But its gradual approach has not succeeded in pulling the economy out of the recession that began in July 1990. Activity did pick up during the summer and early fall -- resulting in modest growth of gross domestic product for the second and third quarters.
The Commerce Department today published its second revision of American gross domestic product for the third quarter -- the total output within the nation's borders -- putting it at a negligibly higher 1.8 percent annual rate instead of the 1.7 percent announced Dec. 4.
But the fragile rebound seems to have crumbled in the last several weeks. Among other things, confidence has eroded, the job market has worsened and retail sales have stagnated.
While there had been talk earlier this month that the Fed might do something emphatic to jolt the economy to life, Mr. Greenspan left the impression in an appearance before the House Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday that he would continue a policy of gradualism.
 
Signaling the Fed's Intentions
 It was not entirely clear today whether the Fed made its decision to ease more aggressively at Tuesday's Open Market Committee meeting or whether the move was prompted by subsequent events, like the report on Thursday morning of a big jump in first-time claims for unemployment insurance and the unexpectedly sharp increases that German authorities posted for their discount and Lombard rates. The German anti-inflation move, which is expected to slow economic growth in that country, could lead to reduced demand for American exports, one of the few sources of strength.
The Fed governor Wayne D. Angell dissented from the discount-rate decision, which the Fed said was instigated by the regional banks in New York and Chicago. Mr. Angell's office said he would not comment on his rationale.
But a summary of policy actions of the Nov. 5 Open Market Committee meeting published today showed Mr. Angell to have been one of two members voting against an easier policy adopted at that time and confirmed in a discount rate cut the next day.
 
Dissent Among Fed Governors
 "Mr. Angell dissented because he was concerned about the impact of further easing on inflation expectations and consequently on long-term interest rates," the record for that meeting showed. "In his view, the prospect for a robust and long-lasting recovery is dependent on the completion of adjustments in business pricing practices, household savings and balance sheets more generally. Monetary policy actions that are perceived as a shift from a focus on price-level stability to one on short-term economic growth may well abort the needed adjustments."
The other dissenter on Nov. 5 was Edward W. Kelley Jr., who cited the still unseen effects of earlier stimulus and the "considerable risks" that further easing would fuel fears of higher inflation. Since then, however, inflation has continued at a subdued 3 to 3.5 percent pace and the economy has deteriorated further.
Today's action means various real short-term interest rates -- actual rate less inflation rate -- are barely positive. Analysts have noted that, while interest rates have come down across the entire spectrum this year, long-term yields in particular have remained fairly high in real terms. That is, 8 percent mortgages at a time of 3 percent to 3.5 percent inflation means real rates of 4.5 to 5 percent.
The discount rate cut, announced at 8:30 A.M. today and effective immediately, was the sixth in the past year. At 3 1/2 percent, the rate is the lowest since November 1964, when it was raised to 4 percent from 3 percent during the military buildup in Vietnam. No official records are kept of the Federal funds rate, but one Wall Street specialist said he believed it had not been as low as 4 percent since 1963.

HEADLINE: End to Cambodian Embargo Seems Near

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 20

 BODY:
The Bush Administration appears to be on the verge of lifting a United States embargo on Cambodia that has been in effect since 1975, when Americans fled the advancing Khmer Rouge and their brutal restructuring of the nation.
Members of Congress, who have been urging the Administration to end the embargo since a Cambodian peace accord was signed in Paris on Oct. 23, say an announcement may be made to coincide with President Bush's trip to Asia beginning Dec. 30. The State Department says only that action is expected "in the near future." 
 With the decision this week by the Treasury Department to relax a ban and allow American travel agents to arrange tours to Vietnam, lifting the embargo on trade with Cambodia would open the way for American business to return to Indochina for the first time since the end of the Vietnam War.
Trade restrictions against Vietnam, whose Government Washington does not yet formally recognize, are being discussed in a working group of United States and Vietnamese representatives. The United States has maintained diplomatic relations with Laos, but trade has been minimal.
 
Unease About Khmer Rouge
 In the House and Senate, there is disquiet among both Democrats and Republicans over what is described as an overly passive American policy on Cambodia. The Khmer Rouge, backed by China, remains the strongest of four Cambodian factions now linked in an interim governing council, and elections for a new government are not expected until 1993 at the earliest.
No efforts have yet been made to disarm the factions. A United Nations coordinator for all programs in Cambodia, including disarmament of the groups and resettlement of their civilian followers, has not been named.
Representative Chester G. Atkins, Democrat of Massachusetts, says the United States will bear great responsibility if the Khmer Rouge becomes a renewed threat, since Washington and the Chinese have insisted on a role for the faction in the peace process.
Mr. Atkins, who serves on the House Appropriations Committee, says that when Administration officials approach Congress in the new year with requests for millions of dollars to pay for American commitments to the rebuilding of Cambodia, they will be pressed for an unambiguous policy opposing a role for the Khmer Rouge under the faction's current leadership.
 
Lawmakers Write to Bush
 "One single clear and continuing theme in United States policy to Cambodia has been our insistence on the inclusion of the Khmer Rouge in the interim Government," Mr. Atkins said in an interview today. "That is really quite astonishing. It sent an enormous signal to the Cambodian people that the killing fields could very easily happen again."
Early this month, Mr. Atkins persuaded 56 Senators and 247 Representatives to sign a letter to President Bush asking that the Administration lend its weight to actions insuring that the Khmer Rouge cannot return to power in any part of Cambodia.
The letter also asks President Bush to support an international tribunal to try the Khmer Rouge leadership for genocide. More than one million Cambodians died during a reign of terror by the radical Communist movement from 1975 to late 1978.
"Every day's delay by President Bush in lifting the trade embargo on Cambodia benefits the Khmer Rouge," Senator Alan Cranston said in a statement issued today.
Vietnam and Cambodia, two of the world's poorest and least developed nations, say an end to American economic sanctions would be critical to their economic growth.
John Gunther Dean, the last American Ambassador to Cambodia before the Khmer Rouge takeover, said this week in an interview that the United States had a special responsibility to help the Cambodians rebuild in safety.
"A lot of people look at us and say, 'What's the U.S. going to do?' " he said. Mr. Dean was lobbying as an envoy of Unesco, which is seeking aid for educational and cultural projects and establishing Cambodia's's first free press.

HEADLINE: Winter Vacation Forecast: From Bleak to Cloudy

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
If "a sad tale's best for winter," as Shakespeare put it, the nation's travel industry is preparing to tell a bleak one.
In a sputtering economy, fewer Americans than usual are planning winter vacations. And for those lucky enough to get away, economic necessity is forcing many to stay closer to home and return sooner than they would have wanted. 
 Even with big discounts, fewer people than expected will be taking winter flights to Europe or Hawaii, or cruises to the Caribbean.
 
Splurging on Nothing
 In a recent survey of 200 American Express travel agents in major cities, nearly 70 percent said their clients were economizing on hotels and airfares, taking shorter vacations and traveling closer to home. Asked on what their clients planned to splurge, 42 percent of the agents replied, "Nothing."
"Even if the numbers of vacationers aren't down a lot," said Jerry Cheske, a spokesman for the American Automobile Association, "we're hearing they'll be spending less, cutting costs and looking to economize."
The prospect of a grim winter, the second in a row for the travel industry, spells trouble not only for the industry but also for the economy in general. Tourism is the leading industry in 13 states, according to the Travel and Tourism Government Affairs Council, and the second or third in 24 others.
Americans and foreign visitors spent more on travel and tourism in 1990 -- $327.3 billion -- than on anything but automobiles and food from the supermarket, the National Travel and Tourism Awareness Council, a coalition of 10 organizations from government and private industry, reported last week. With 5.9 million workers in everything from to amusement parks to car rental offices, the travel and tourism industry is the nation's third largest employer.
 
$2 Billion Loss Expected
 But at the moment, that employer is reeling. The nation's airlines said recently that they expected to lose almost $2 billion this year, on top of the record $4 billion they lost in 1990. And 60 percent of the nation's hotels are reporting a net operating loss, said Coopers & Lybrand, the accounting firm.
And travel agencies have been bludgeoned by the recession; Travel Agent magazine says 2,300 agencies closed or went bankrupt through the first nine months of this year, as against 1,600 for all of 1990.
When Americans were asked in a recent survey by the 20,000-member American Society of Travel Agents to list their favorite vacation destinations, 6 percent of the respondents listed "visiting relatives."
"It's the first time such a designation ever showed up in the poll," said Courtney Froemming, a spokeswoman for the organization, "and it appears directly related to the economy."
 
A Nontraveler's Lament
 David Kenney, a bookstore clerk in Northampton, Mass., went with his girlfriend to New Orleans for Mardi Gras last year, and the year before they visited San Francisco. Although still in the same job, "This winter I can't even afford a ski weekend in Vermont," he said. "Everything is just so much more expensive, especially in the Northeast."
What makes this winter's preliminary indications doubly disappointing, industry executives say, is that winter vacations have become more popular in recent years. Last year winter vacations accounted for 18 percent of all vacations by Americans, as against 60 percent in the summer.
This change is mostly because frequent short vacations are better suited to households in which both partners work. And having been battered last winter by the Persian Gulf war, the industry expected an explosion of pent-up demand this winter.
Unless there is a dramatic turnaround soon, that does not seem likely.
In Hawaii, despite a promotion drive and what travel agents say are some of the lowest air-land package deals in years, visitors from the mainland will fall below expectations.
"The first quarter of the year is always our best," said Clem Judd, president of the Hawaii Hotel Association. "But from what we can see this will not be a strong winter, because consumers on the mainland don't yet have confidence in the economy."
Similarly, the outlook is uncertain for some popular Florida tourist spots.
"Based on what I can see, we're looking at a sluggish winter season," said Stu Blumberg, the president of the Miami Beach Resort Hotel Association. "We'll probably come out about the same as in 1991, but that was not a great winter."
 
Lower Hotel Rates Likely
 In Orlando, which averages more than 13.6 million visitors a year, "the word 'recession' is on few lips," one hotelier said, "but on everybody's mind." That is because, with demand soft, rates for Orlando's 77,300 hotel rooms are expected to average $2 to $3 less this winter than last.
In part because attendance was down this year even at Walt Disney World, Disney -- to the surprise of some other Orlando merchants -- agreed to participate in Magicard, a promotion offering discounts of 10 to 50 percent for about 80 attractions, hotels and restaurants in the area.
"We made it available in mid-May via a '900' number that cost the caller $3, the price of printing, handling and mailing the card," said John Rutherford, the public relations director of the Orlando Convention and Visitors Bureau. "By the end of June we had to switch to a toll-free '800' number, because there was virtually no response. People wouldn't pay the three dollars. Since then we've distributed about a half-million cards."
The picture is no less discouraging out West.
"We think we're going to have a winter much like last year, flat to some extent," said Pat Tierney, director of the Tucson Convention and Visitors Bureau in Arizona.
 
Bets Are Off in Vegas
 And not even Las Vegas is immune.
"The recession may not have a heavy impact here, but it will have some impact because we're not recession-proof," said John Reible of the Las Vegas News Bureau, an arm of the Chamber of Commerce. "We probably won't get the occupancy rate we would otherwise, and some of the long-distance trippers probably won't come."
Even the fact that San Diego will be the host city for the 1992 America's Cup races, beginning next month, seems not to have had a major impact on tourism to that city.
"There appears to be an extremely high level of caution among travelers," said Tom Vincent, chairman of the San Diego Hotel and Motel Association. "People aren't booking rooms ahead of time like in the past. I can only guess a lot of people are concerned that if they take a vacation they won't have a job when they get back."
Inevitably, some parts of the travel industry are predicting a good winter. The North American cruise ship industry is projecting a 10 percent growth next year, said Jim Godsman, president of the Cruise Line International Association. But the increase is not as great as the industry expected, and the industry is small -- about four million passengers this year, as against the estimated 450 million people who will fly on domestic airlines this year. Moreover, its growth is being fueled in part by discounts as high as 50 percent.
 
Economizing at Ski Resorts
 Ski resorts in New Mexico and Colorado report higher bookings than last winter. But a larger percentage of visitors this winter will be from neighboring states, officials there say, and their stays will be shorter.
Colleen Murphy, the corporate communications director of the Book-of-the-Month Club in New York, said she and her husband, Ervin, are going to Utah for a week in March to ski. Even so, they will be watching expenses.
"We chose it because we got a good deal on it, and it was cheaper than going to the islands," she said. "But we have a kitchenette to avoid the added cost of eating at restaurants. In fact, we plan to take along a lot of Grape-Nuts."
Industry executives now say the industry is unlikely to pull out of the doldrums before next summer. Until then, they might take comfort in other words from Shakespeare in "The Winter's Tale":
I must be patient till the heavens look
With an aspect more favorable.

HEADLINE: Third-Quarter Growth Put at Revised 1.8% Rate

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 20

 BODY:
The United States economy grew at a modest annual rate of 1.8 percent in the summer as consumer spending and the nation's trade performance showed slightly better gains than previously believed, the Government said today.
But analysts said the modest improvement in the gross domestic product did not change their view that the economic recovery stalled during the summer, raising the very real possibility that the economy has toppled back into recession in the current October-December quarter.
 
Ups and Downs
 The new G.D.P. report made a change of one-tenth of a percentage point in an estimate released two weeks ago, which put growth at an annual rate of 1.7 percent in the third quarter. 
 This followed growth of 1.4 percent in the April-June quarter, which in turn had followed two consecutive quarterly declines in G.D.P., reflecting the recession that began in July 1990.
The return to growth in the G.D.P. had caused the Bush Administration to declare the downturn at an end. But weak statistics in recent months have raised fears that the recovery has faltered and the recession has returned full force.
Today's revisions showed that the economic weakness has kept inflation well under control. A price index tied to the G.D.P. rose at an annual rate of just 2.1 percent in the third quarter, down from gains of 5 percent in the first quarter and 3.1 percent in the second quarter.
The new-found strength came primarily in consumer spending, where purchases of electricity and gas rose because of colder weather in the Midwest, and in the country's trade performance, where the growth of exports was revised slightly upward.
 
Debate Continues
 The small revision really offered no surprises and did little to settle the debate over what the economy will do in the current quarter.
Today's G.D.P. report was the second appearance of the Government's new measurement for the overall economy. After a half century, the G.D.P. is replacing the gross national product -- a move welcomed by most economists as providing a better barometer of how the domestic economy is doing.
The difference is that the G.D.P. measures output within the nation's borders while the G.N.P. includes profits earned by American companies on their overseas subsidiaries.
The new report said the G.D.P. was increasing at an annual rate of $22 billion in the third quarter, $1.7 billion higher than previously estimated.
While economists said the small gain in exports was heartening, they said consumer spending on discretionary purchases was revised downward and initial reports for the fourth quarter have shown further weakness.

HEADLINE: Economic Pulse: Long Island - A special report;
After Decades of Prosperity, Long Island Confronts a Stagnant Economy

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BETHPAGE, L.I., Dec. 20

 BODY:
Long Island residents are beginning to learn that they just can't have it all.
The island, frequently listed in surveys in the 1980's as one of the country's most desirable spots, is struggling now, not just with the effects of the national recession that have battered states throughout the Northeast but also with stubborn home-grown problems that will make it harder to bounce back when the region's recovery begins. 
 "All of the ingredients that made Long Island such a success in the 1980's have petered out," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, Regional Commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. "All the key engines have stalled or gone into reverse, and as a result what you're left with is a lot of question marks."
Here in Bethpage, the Grumman Corporation, the center of a once-massive defense industry, has laid off 9,000 people, or a third of its Long Island workforce, since 1987. Around the Island, more than 90,000 people are out of work, so that in 1990 -- for the first time ever -- Nassau and Suffolk counties lost more jobs than they gained. Businesses are failing; unemployed workers are stuck with houses they can't sell, and the Island's young people are fleeing, looking for a better life someplace else.
"This happens to be the worst recession Long Island has experienced since the end of World War II," said Dr. Lee E. Koppelman, executive director of the Long Island Regional Planning Board. "Some of the reasons are beyond the scope of Long Island to solve, but there are plenty of locally induced reasons."
 
Residue of 80's Growth
 Many are direct results of the rapid growth in the 1980's: an overburdened, outmoded transportation system; burdensome taxes; energy, housing and garbage-disposal costs that are among the highest in the country; a Byzantine structure of overlapping, inefficient governments, and a growing rift between environmental and economic interests that tends to discourage business and stall development.
In the high-flying 1980's, residents and businesses were willing to overlook, or at least accept, these problems. Maybe costs were high, but so was employment, so were salaries, and so was that important suburban intangible: quality of life. Now the equation is out of balance, and planners say Long Islanders must lower their expectations about living the good life.
 
Unrealistic Aspirations
 "People aren't realistic about what it takes to sustain a culture," said John H. Marburger, president of the State University of New York at Stony Brook. "People's aspirations about life style are too expensive to be sustained with what we have now in the economy."
Even as Long Island's economy suffers from New York City's white-collar layoffs, the employment numbers on the Island itself look bleak. In a place with an exceptionally skilled labor force, where the median family income was $46,475 in 1989, the unemployment rate climbed to 6.8 percent in September, compared to 4.1 percent a year earlier and 3.4 percent in September 1988. "A good part of that reflects the downsizing of the defense industry, but the recession has really touched all sectors of the economy," said Pearl S. Kamer, the chief economist for the Long Island Regional Planning Board.
Among the worst-off sectors are manufacturing, which lost 24,500 jobs between June 1989 and June 1991, construction, which lost 9,700 jobs, and trade, which lost 22,500 jobs. Things are so bad that Gary Huth, an associate economist at the New York State Labor Department's office in Hicksville, pointed to the Federal Government's decision to extend jobless benefits to the long-time unemployed as one of the few positive things that promise "to provide a substantial income shot into Long Island."
 
From Despair Comes Hope
 Of the 32,000 Island residents who have exhausted their jobless benefits since the end of February, about 22,400 are probably still out of work and eligible for an extension, Mr. Huth said. "It's not the same thing as having the situation changed by having jobs created, but it would add a healthy boost of about $50 million into the economy," he said.
The recession has all but halted building on Long Island. In the construction industry, which has been one of the mainstays of the Long Island economy, more than half the workforce of 60,000 is unemployed, said David Richardson, business manager of the Building and Construction Trades of Nassau and Suffolk Counties, which represents 52 unions. He and other industry leaders say the problem is not just the banks' unwillingness to lend money for new construction, but also the Island's dauntingly tangled bureaucracy, which has discouraged growth even in good times.
"It has made the whole question of economic growth on Long Island an enormously complicated thing," said John V. N. Klein, a former Suffolk County Executive who is chairman of a group seeking ways to reduce the tax burden. Pointing out that the Island has some 660 different taxing jurisdictions, from counties to sewer districts, he said that in some places, one piece of real estate could be in 15 taxing districts at once -- each with its own zoning codes or permit requirements.
"The intricate processes of approval that the localities have built up over the years turns people off," he said. "Twenty years ago, it would have taken less than a month to get approval for, let's say, an industrial building. But now it may take a year to 18 months. It is the bureaucratic characteristics of the local governments that make it happen that way."
 
Environment
Battle to Preserve A Rural Character
 The Island's increasingly powerful environmentalists take a much different view. Worried about damage to the area's fragile underground water supply and concerned that Suffolk County will go the way of densely developed Nassau, they say that what ails Long Island is too much development, not too little. Combining forces with civic associations and other local groups, environmentalists have successfully delayed or helped cancel project after project, from a huge shopping mall in Brookhaven to a segment of the Long Island Expressway service road in Syosset that was planned by the state to help ease traffic congestion.
The environmentalists say they are not obstructionists and not zealots, but rather people who care about the Island's future. "The spate of new environmental regulations and environmental lawsuits is the result of the effect of overdevelopment taking its toll on Long Island, both environmentally and economically," said Richard A. Amper, executive director of the Long Island Pine Barrens Society, which is involved in a lawsuit seeking to block development in a large swath of Suffolk County.
Planners like Dr. Koppelman say that many environmentalists have legitimate concerns about untrammeled growth. But, Dr. Koppelman said, their agenda is increasingly set by a small group he describes as people "masquerading as environmentalists who really want to stop the world."
 
Battle Over Airport
 There is little common ground between many of the most active environmentalists and business leaders. Last month, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo came to the Island with a plan to boost the economy that included a study of the development of Calverton Airport in Suffolk County, a project that would allow Long Island businesses to ship cargo by air rather than using congested highways.
While business groups reacted positively to the announcement, the area's most prominent environmentalists said development of Calverton would poison one of the Island's most fragile areas.
"At a time when Mario Cuomo needs to demonstrate vision and leadership, his plans for the future of Long Island promise heavy debts to subsidize a clique of development interests," said Van Howell, a spokesman for the Earth Island Center of Long Island, in a news release denouncing the proposal.
 
Industry in Transition
Learning to Adapt Without Defense
 Even as the environmentalists and business leaders seem to grow further apart, the Island is painfully trying to find something to replace the dying defense industry, which fueled growth through most of the boom years. At its peak in the 1940's and the 1950's, defense accounted for about half the jobs on Long Island; in 1988, the figure was 25 percent and falling fast.
"We're seeing a change in the economic base, with a downsizing of the defense industry that's more than cyclical," said Pearl S. Kamercq, the planning board's chief economist.
Beyond the changes at Grumman, where the workforce has been reduced to 13,000 from a peak of 36,000 in the late 1960's, many of the Island's smaller companies and subcontractors have closed shop, moved away or tried to diversify into non-defense areas.
The results have been mixed so far. "We don't know yet whether the subcontractors or other companies will be successful in switching their work to civilian industries -- that's a big if," said Rosemary Scanlon, chief economist for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
Many business leaders point to the fledgling biotechnology industry as one hope for the future, calling it a natural match for the island's talented labor pool, good educational facilities and first-rate research centers like the State University of New York at Stony Brook and Brookhaven National Laboratory.
 
Housing
For the Young, Few Cheap Homes
 But experts on planning say that to attract and keep new industry, Long Island is going to have to do something about some stubborn basic problems.
One of the most pressing is the lack of affordable housing, which is driving away many of the Island's young people who would otherwise make up its future workforce. Dr. Koppelman estimates that by the end of the decade Long Island will need 100,000 units of affordable housing to meet the demand.
There is no lack of older, higher-priced homes on the Island. In the early 1980's, real estate prices rose so fast that from 1981 to 1985, many houses had doubled in value. There are now thousands of houses on the market on Long Island, many owned by people desperate to find a cheaper life someplace else. But at a median price of $165,900 in Suffolk County and $209,500 in Nassau, many of the homes are beyond the price range of workers in their mid-20's.
But instead of building cheaper houses, developers built office buildings, which by 1990 had a vacancy rate of 20.4 percent.
Businesses say they don't need new office space; they need new houses for their workers.
 
Barriers to Growth
 "Businesses have said time and time again that their reasons for locating somewhere else or not coming or not expanding are the high cost of home ownership, high real estate taxes and high utility costs," said Jim Morgo, president of the Long Island Housing Partnership, which works to develop affordable housing.
Mr. Morgo said that two things were stymying the construction of affordable housing: restrictive zoning laws and residents' own reluctance to accept clustered housing like rental homes or condominium developments -- a reluctance that have the effect of pricing their own children out of Long Island's housing market.
"Many people still have the Long Island mindset that they want houses on at least a quarter of an acre with a yard and a picket fence," he said. "And it's really shocking to see how many people can't afford to have that."
To Mr. Morgo, an attitudinal change is needed. "People have to know that increased density does not mean the urbanization of Long Island," he said.
 
Doing Business
Worry Over Taxes And Bureaucracy
 It is a given, by now, that Long Island is one of the country's most expensive places to live, because of the combination of state and local taxes, retail prices and energy, housing, and transportation costs. In the past, there was always enough business here to provide the tax base needed to sustain the high level of services in school districts and local governments. But now, the story is a sadly familiar one: even as Federal and state money dries up, the tax base is shrinking, government is making painful cuts, and taxes are rising. And businesses are moving out, having concluded that the equation that always showed Long Island was worth it has now tipped to the other side.
Many officials say there is a growing sense that the Island is anti-business. They cite the case of the Olympus Corporation Scientific Products Group, a subsidiary of a Japanese-owned company. Based in Lake Success for the last 24 years, Olympus, with about 600 workers on Long Island, has spent four years looking for a place to build a new $40 million headquarters on the Island -- a project that would create jobs and pump money into the economy and provide a badly needed lift to the sagging construction industry.
The company has considered some 25 sites in half a dozen communities, but none has panned out, said Richard Kester, a senior vice president. In some cases, civic groups raised objections about increased traffic and other environmental issues. In other cases, he said, it became clear that the zoning was so restrictive that it was useless to even try.
It's not that Olympus doesn't want to stay on Long Island -- it likes the highly skilled workforce and has longstanding ties here. But, Mr. Kester said, if the process drags on, the company will be forced to move away. It has already installed its manufacturing operations in Albuquerque. "They were extremely excited to get us, and they greased everything through the system," Mr. Kester said.
Environmentalists continue to argue that what makes Long Island great isn't business, but the shore, the air and the land. Tourism is one of the most important industries on the Island, they say, adding that for Long Island to thrive, it has to put even further restrictions on business and development.
"The solution lies in accommodation of the environment by otherwise self-serving interests," said Mr. Amper of the Pine Barrens Society. "We live on an island with finite resources, so an economy that's based on unrestricted building isn't going to be sustainable anyway, no matter what the environmental consequences."
But he is fighting with increasingly tough opponents from business and government, who say the answer is fewer restrictions, not more. "We need fundamental, radical change in the relationship between business and government," said Bruce Nyman, supervisor of the City of Long Beach in Nassau County. "We took the business community for granted all these years and kept responding to our constituents' wishes, and we forgot that without a strong business base we can't support our residents."
 
Need for Reorganization
 He and others who are studying Long Island say that it is has reached a crucial juncture. "They've got to reorganize," said Mitchell Moss, a professor of urban planning at New York University. "For Long Island to succeed, there will have to be a massive reorganizing to reduce costs. There's going to have to be strategic decisions to put in high density at certain points."
The traffic problem has to be addressed, too, experts say, through a combination of road improvements, support for suburban bus lines and the encouragement of staggered work hours and carpooling. New development must take place, they say, but in a measured way, with a focus on rehabilitating the older structures built during the 1950's.
And, perhaps most important, planners say that a new and perhaps less selfish attitude has to emerge.
"There's still a recognition that this place is desirable," said Mr. Kunz of the Regional Planning Board. "And public opinion is turning around and saying, 'The economy isn't doing so well, so we're going to have to make some improvements.' You can't say no to everything."

HEADLINE: Diplomats Without a Country;
Life After the Fall: Representing Neither Soviet Nor Union

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO

 BODY:
For Alexander Denisov, spokesman of the Soviet Mission to the United Nations, the rudest reflection of his country's disintegration came not from Washington, but at a discount electronics shop in Manhattan.
He went there a month ago to buy a stereo receiver, and was shocked when the salesman turned down the tax exemption card he carries as a diplomat. 
 "I cannot accept this card," the salesman said. "This country doesn't exist anymore."
"I didn't like the joke," Mr. Denisov recalled. "I said: 'Mind your own business. This card was good enough for the State Department; it's good enough for you.' " Even now, Mr. Denisov's face tightens at the memory.
Smart alecks aside, diplomats and other functionaries of the former Soviet Union say it has been disorienting, at times frightening, to see their country dissolve and redefine itself amid confusion and the threat of famine these last few months. In a scene probably mirrored in embassies and missions around the world, Moscow's envoys have endured unimagined humiliations and uncertainties as the Soviet Union's status has fallen from superpower to international basket case.
Yesterday, they were taken aback by the unilateral seizure by President Boris N. Yeltsin of the Kremlin and takeover of the Foreign Ministry in Moscow the day before. Yuri Chizhik, a press attache, said the mission would handle Mr. Yeltsin's orders as it had the failed putschists who grabbed power from the Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in August.
"We refused then to pass on their decrees to the United Nations, and I think the same sort of thinking will guide us in this," Mr. Chizhik said.
Diplomats here wonder whether the Soviet Foreign Ministry will be replaced by a Russian Foreign Ministry, or a ministry of the coalition that may be created at today's meeting of leaders from the Kazakhstan meeting of European and Asian republics.
"Last week was different from today," Mr. Chizik said. "Yesterday was different, and next Monday will be dramatically different."
 
Life Without Certainty
 For now, the envoys dwell in hybrid worlds, speaking the language of democracy and the free market, but still living behind a steel fence at their compound in the Riverdale section of the Bronx and displaying the red flag inside their mission.
At the mission on 67th Street, the shelves in the visitors' waiting room still offer pamphlets dutifully reporting meetings of the Communist Party, now defunct. In vintage Cold War fashion, two surveillance cameras, one of them hidden, continue to record visitors. Yesterday morning a young Russian flashed an obscene gesture at one of them.
"K.G.B.," was his brief explanation.
Being a Soviet diplomat used to be easier, when a diplomat could confidently chart his Government's position opposite Washington's.
Now a kind of gallows humor appears to sustain morale at the mission, where the 150 employees -- diplomats, secretaries, drivers and maintenance workers -- count thousands of relatives back in the Soviet Union.
They are not even sure what to call their home country.
"Until the new entity is internationally accepted, we're still the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, although there is no union, no soviet, no socialism and no republics," Mr. Denisov said. "That's the paradox we live with today." He said that legally the republics of the Soviet Union are states.
 
Loyalty to Moscow
 He made sure a visitor noted that the lights were still burning and the heat turned on at the mission. Then, paraphrasing Mark Twain, he said, "The reports of our death are greatly exaggerated."
Day by day, Mr. Denisov and others have watched the underpinnings of their identities slip away.
"I came here as a representative of the Soviet Foreign Ministry, and that does not exist anymore," he said yesterday.
At the age of 54, he imagines he may well have to look for another job when he returns to Moscow later this year. But he cannot envision a job out of government.
"When I left my country there was no private sector," he said. "I just don't have any idea what it is."
Like Mr. Denisov, Yuri Romantsov, the new chief of the Tass bureau at Rockefeller Center, does not know what to call his home country -- so he tries to avoid sentences in which he would normally use its name.
In the temporary absence of a country, Soviets here said they think of home as Moscow, the city most of them left for New York. And those who are native Muscovites, like Mr. Romantsov, think of home as Russia.
The job of correspondents for Tass, faithful mouthpiece of the ruling Communist Party now turned news agency, has changed also. Yuri Kirilchenko, a 34-year-old correspondent in New York, said he no longer had to send classified reports on political and economic trends to high-ranking officials in Moscow. "Now we have declassified this information and made it available to everyone in the form of booklets," he said.
He worries about another kind of distortion in the rapid about-face going on in Moscow. Under the old system, his editors especially wanted stories about the depravity of capitalism, and so Mr. Kirilchenko offered a stream of articles about the homeless and hungry of New York.
But on a recent visit to Moscow, he spoke to a group of teen-agers who wanted to know what it was really like here. "I honestly told them about everything I saw, but when I tried to tell them I really saw homeless people by Radio City, their reaction was skeptical," Mr. Kirilchenko reported. "They said, 'Come on, do you really expect us to believe that crap? You're just giving us propaganda again.' "
He understood, all too well, the skepticism. For Mr. Kirilchenko, as for many of his compatriots in the former Soviet Union, yesterday's masters have become today's villains. Now the Tass reporter has a calendar hanging in the gray cubicle where he works. It is a reproduction of "The Return of the Prodigal Son," a nightmarish painting by the Russian nationalist artist Ilya Glazunov. It shows the great figures of Russian history -- Pushkin, Peter the Great, Catherine the Great -- sadly gazing at a Russia pillaged by 73 years of Communist rule, something that Mr. Kirilchenko played no small role in upholding.

HEADLINE: A Move to Break World Trade Deadlock

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GENEVA, Dec. 20

 BODY:
After five tense years of negotiations over liberalizing world trade, the head of the world's principal trade organization sought to break the deadlock today with a proposed agreement that calls for cutting subsidies to farmers worldwide, phasing out import quotas on third-world textiles and giving more protection to patents and copyrights.
In piecing together the complex 500-page document, Arthur Dunkel, Director General of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, sought to present, on a take-it-or-leave-it basis, a package of compromises that would set rules for world trade well into the 21st century. In effect, he cast himself as a binding arbitrator, hoping that GATT's 108 nations will go along, even though no nation would get everything it wanted.
 
Success Is Uncertain
 Mr. Dunkel is betting that the promised benefits of this complex agreement will be enough to persuade nations to ignore the intensive lobbying of the many special-interest groups that oppose certain provisions. But whether he will succeed is far from certain. Some negotiators said tonight that the continuing dispute over farm subsidies could torpedo the whole package. And on Thursday, even before Mr. Dunkel's plan was distributed, France's Agricultural Minister said his nation would seek to bury the Dunkel draft because he assumed it would go too far toward meeting Washington's demands to cut the subsidies. 
And the United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, issued a statement shortly before release of the complete text that was markedly more cautious than her stance at the beginning of this week. "It is important to emphasize that the Director General's document is only a draft; it is not a finished legal text," she said.
Mrs. Hills had warned on Monday that while changes to Mr. Dunkel's proposals would be possible, "if one party tries to change one thing and there's a rush to change, you're going to have the agreement unravel."
Still, at GATT's headquarters in Geneva, many trade officials said today that Mr. Dunkel's plan stood a good chance of being approved by the nations involved in the talks.
Mr. Dunkel's draft agreement calls for creating a stronger mechanism to settle trade disputes and for granting banks and other financial service companies greater access to foreign markets. His plan would also make it harder for governments to grant subsidies to industry, which give companies in some countries an advantage over their competitors.
GATT officials say the accord would save consumers worldwide tens of billions of dollars a year. But farmers in Europe and textile workers in the United States are lobbying against the agreement, saying it threatens their livelihood. Some American drug companies complain that the accord does not give them enough protection against patent violations by third-world countries; banks in India and Singapore fear the agreement will make it too easy for big Western banks to enter their markets.
"Everyone will try to change the package, but all their efforts will neutralize each other," said Tran Van Thinh, the European Community's chief GATT negotiator.
Mr. Dunkel released his draft agreement hours after American and European Community officials broke off their talks, without agreement. The two sides have been unable to agree over how much to cut the $300 billion in subsidies that farmers receive each year worldwide. The United States, Canada, Argentina, Australia and other food-exporting nations have been pressing for sharp cuts.
The five-year talks, known as the Uruguay Round because they began in Punta del Este, Uruguay, were originally scheduled to end last December. But the impasse over farm subsidies blocked completion.
After considering Mr. Dunkel's draft, senior trade negotiators are supposed to return to Geneva on Jan. 13 to complete an agreement and hammer out the unresolved details.
GATT officials hope to schedule a final meeting in April, possibly in Morocco, where trade ministers would sign the trade agreement.
The draft accord would help developing countries by phasing out over 10 years the multifiber arrangement, which allows wealthy industrial countries to set strict limits on imports of third-world apparel. The Bush Administration had wanted a longer phase-out period, but third-world officials say restrictions on their textile exports have long held back their growth.
The plan also calls on the developing world to phase out over the next decade their violations of foreign copyrights and patents.
Mr. Dunkel's draft makes a nod to Japan by creating more specific rules for what a country must prove to find another country guilty of "dumping" -- the practice of selling goods below cost or below what they sell for in a domestic market. Japan has been accused by the United States and the European Community of dumping various goods, most recently mini-vans.
At the same time, the plan makes concessions to the United States and the European Community by establishing rules that allow them to crack down on factories that are said to circumvent dumping laws by bringing in low-cost parts and doing a bit of final assembly so the products are not considered imports.
Many economists and government officials say success in the GATT talks could provide some much-needed impetus to the world's languishing economy. They also say the talks are important for Eastern Europe and the developing world, whose economic crises can be alleviated if they obtain greater access to foreign markets.
 
Bush and Major Conferred
 In the last week President Bush has talked with Prime Minister John Major of Britain and other European leaders, trying to give the talks the impetus they need to succeed. In Brussels, the United States Secretary of Agriculture, Edward Madigan, discussed farm subsidies with the European Community's Farm Commissioner, Ray MacSharry of Ireland.
American officials say they are near agreement on how fast to cut farm subsidies: cuts of 30 to 35 percent over five or six years are being debated. But differences remain over what the base period should be, how much subsidized exports the community should be allowed to have and the community's demand to be allowed to reduce some farm imports to offset losses in exports it may suffer because of cuts in export subsidies.

HEADLINE: Newman Helps Make Neediest's Day

BYLINE: By J. PEDER ZANE

 BODY:
Fueled by a generous contribution from Paul Newman's food company, The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund soared past the $2 million mark in total contributions yesterday.
The $100,000 donation from Newman's Own Inc. combined with a $20 check from Arpy Kashmanian of Forest Hills, a $100 contribution from June Danielson of New Rochelle, N.Y., and hundreds of other gifts enabled the Neediest Cases to post its biggest day this year: $178,187.37. 
 But the 80th annual appeal is falling steadily behind last year's pace. Starting off on Thanksgiving Day with $16,000 less than the 1990 campaign, this year's drive now stands $115,000 behind last year's total as it enters its most critical period.
From Dec. 21 to Jan. 10 last year, the Neediest Cases received $1.52 million in contributions. Put another way, more than one-third of the $4.4 million contributed in the yearlong campaign, was recorded in that three-week period.
Many other charities are reporting similar difficulties. Donations are down 7 percent at The Children's Aid Society, while the Diocese of Brooklyn reports that unsolicited contributions have fallen 30 percent.
Although governments provide some relief, fiscal pressures have led many states to drastically cut programs that provide emergency cash assistance to avoid homelessness and hunger, according to a report issued Thursday by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington and the Center for the Study of the States, an affiliate of the State University of New York at Albany.
Nonprofit groups, like the seven charities supported by the Neediest Cases, report great increases in requests for food, rent assistance and clothing. The United Jewish Appeal-Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York, for example, has provided a record amount of money -- more than $900,000 -- this year for homelessness prevention.
To help those families the federation has used money provided to them by the Neediest Cases. Since it was founded in 1912 by Adolph S. Ochs, who was then the publisher of The New York Times, the Neediest Cases has raised money for New York's sick, poor and disabled. The newspaper covers all of the campaign's overhead so that every dollar collected is passed on to the seven charities.
Contributions like the one from Mr. Newman's company indicate that some see today's economic problems as a challenge to give more. In the letter attached to the check, A. E. Hotchner, executive vice president of Newman's Own, wrote: "It seems to Paul and me that, when times get tough, it behooves those who are doing well to increase their efforts to help those who aren't, rather than to pull back. If there was some way to communicate this spirit to the affluent, it might help fill the void which is being felt so keenly this Christmas."

HEADLINE: Fed Cut Explosive for Bonds

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices in the credit markets exploded and short- and long-term interest rates fell sharply yesterday after the Federal Reserve Board lowered the discount rate by a full percentage point, to 3 1/2 percent.
The cut in the discount rate, the biggest in a decade, was followed later by confirmation that the Fed had also pushed down its target for the overnight Federal funds rate by half a percentage point, to 4 percent. 
 The move stunned and delighted credit market participants as well as stock traders. Over the last few days, both markets had come to the reluctant conclusion that the Fed would delay another round of cuts in short-term rates for several weeks.
Aside from the timing of the announcement, traders and analysts were surprised by the size of the cut. Based on recent statements by the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, few credit market participants had any reason to suspect that the next rate reduction, when it came, would be more than a modest half-point cut in the discount rate and a quarter-point cut in the funds rate.
 
'Gift Beyond Comprehension'
 "For most people, this is a gift beyond comprehension," one government bond trader said.
Over the near term, analysts said that most of the beneficial impact of the Fed's move would be seen in further reductions in heavy debt borne by corporations and individuals.
The fact that many commercial banks followed the Fed's lead and lowered their prime lending rates by a full percentage point, to 6 1/2 percent, will help in that process, analysts said, since many consumer borrowing rates are tied to the prime.
"Moving rates a percentage point is going to wake a lot of people up," said Michael J. Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc. "I heard several people say they were definitely going to refinance their mortgages now."
Most of the explosive reaction to the Fed's move came within an hour after it was announced yesterday morning. Traders said that with Christmas approaching, most market participants deserted their desks shortly after midday.
By late in the day, the Treasury's 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 104 30/32 , up 29/32 , to yield 7.57 percent, compared with 7.65 percent late Thursday and 7.76 percent on Dec. 13.
 
Secondary Market
 In the secondary market for Treasury notes, the 7.50 percent 10-year notes were offered at 103 7/8 late yesterday, up 29/32 , to yield 6.95 percent.
Yields on the new two-year and five-year notes sold earlier this week also fell.
The 6 1/8 percent five-year notes were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 6.03 percent. And the 5 percent two-year notes were offered in when-issued trading at a price to yield 4.83 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates plummeted.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 3.70 percent late yesterday, down 32 basis points, or 32 one-hundredths of a percentage point. Three-month rates have not been this low since May 1972. Six-month bill rates fell by a similar amount, to a late offered rate of 3.81 percent. And one-year bill rates fell by 27 basis points, to a late offered rate of 3.90 percent.
The Fed's stunning move did not immediately create a stampede among corporations to refinance old debt or to offer new debt issues. That is not likely to take place until sometime in January, participants in the investment-grade corporate bond market said.
One company that did take advantage of the huge rally was the Commercial Credit Corporation, which offered $200 million worth of four-year notes at competitive bid.
A bid from a group led by Lehman Brothers won the securities.
The 6 3/8 percent notes, which mature Jan. 1, 1996, were reoffered to investors at a price of $99.774 to yield 6.44 percent, 83 basis points over the prevailing yield on Treasury securities of comparable maturity.
The issue, which is noncallable for life, is rated A-2 by Moody's Investors Service and A by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.

HEADLINE: The Cuomo Money Morass: $5 Billion and No Quick Fix

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Dec. 20

 BODY:
The fiscal morass that Gov. Mario M. Cuomo cited today as his reason for staying out of the Presidential race consists of gaps totaling at least $5 billion in the current and the next state budget. The Legislature has not made any headway in closing either, despite six weeks of intensive negotiations here.
But while a Cuomo candidacy was widely seen as a new dynamic that could have made resolving the problem even more difficult, there was little immediate sense today that the converse might be true: that a decision not to run would automatically pave the way for an agreement. 
 Minutes after all the drama came to an end and the Governor made his announcement, the Democrats who control the Assembly met to pass their plan to close the $875 million gap in this year's $30 billion budget, which they said relied on significantly less borrowing than the package advanced by the State Senate.
But the Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, Republican of Oyster Bay, L.I., quickly condemned the Assembly program as "an unacceptable Band-Aid solution" and complained that it "raises taxes, relies on fiscal gimmicks and contains no real welfare or Medicaid reform."
 
And Now, Vengeance?
 And Mr. Cuomo, who angrily lashed out at the Republicans for what he described as their obstruction of previous efforts to forge an accord, went all of a minute and a half into his announcement before he talked of summoning the Senate back to Albany on Monday to hammer away again at budget talks.
Given that the Republicans did not help Mr. Cuomo to strike a deal in time to meet his deadline for entering the New Hampshire primary, there has been considerable speculation here that the Governor might strike his own vengeance now. He could hold out for a tough program of cuts in suburban school aid and other programs whose protection by the Republicans has been a cornerstone of their ability to hold onto their Senate majority. They are all running for re-election next fall; Mr. Cuomo is not.
The Governor did not say whether he would now pursue new and harsher remedies for the state's ills. But significantly, he seemed to cast considerable doubt on whether he would be willing to work with the Senate any more on a 15-month stretched-out budget.
This plan, which would simultaneously attack both deficit problems, would have freed the Governor to hit the campaign trail. It remains attractive to the Senate, in large measure because it could blunt the pain of many of the cuts the Legislature would have to make now to cut the current budget deeply enough to produce a balance in its remaining three months.
 
Like Talking About a Diet
 But without ruling the plan out, Mr. Cuomo struck a contemptuous tone toward the Senate at his Capitol news conference when he was asked whether it remained on the table.
"The 15-month plan is where it has been from the beginning," the Governor said, "a wonderful, wonderful idea. 'I'm going to lose weight.' There's a terrific idea. Thirty pounds. Wonderful. That's in this category. They say, 'Let's lose 30 pounds.' Meanwhile, you're eating sundaes and you're eating heroes. You're not going to lose 30 pounds, and that's where the 15-month plan is."
The discipline Mr. Cuomo was referring to would be the ability to decide now on spending cuts and other actions that would carry well into 1993. Given the crisis atmosphere that has become the hallmark of budget-making in the Capitol -- where the Governor and the Legislature have failed, for seven years in a row, to fashion budgets by the legal deadline -- there certainly has been plenty of skepticism here that they could agree on a plan, in effect, months ahead of time.
The heart of the dispute remains the insistence by the Senate that the cuts focus on the expanding state spending for Medicaid and welfare, up nearly 20 percent over the past year, in large part because the recession has swelled the rolls for these programs.
 
'Don't Look Back'
 Both the Governor and the Assembly have condemned many of the Republicans' proposals for cutting these services as an attack on the poor, and faulted others for containing what they say are excessive estimates of savings.
Aside from the budget battle, left very much intact today, there was clear regret written on the faces of many of his aides during his announcement this afternoon, which came just 90 minutes before the deadline for entering the New Hampshire primary. The excitement of working for a potential Presidential nominee behind them, they now turn back to the exhausting task of budget-cutting.
Another disappointed bystander was the state's Lieutenant Governor, Stan Lundine, who would have largely run the state in Mr. Cuomo's absence and would have become the Governor had Mr. Cuomo become President. But he sought to cast his discontent less a matter of personal loss than of larger regret.
"I think he's a great American," Mr. Lundine said. "I think he'd be a great candidate; I think he'd be a great President. But you make decisions at the appropriate time. Today he felt was the appropriate time, so he's made a decision. And now, you don't look back."

HEADLINE: U.S. Finds Japan 'Dumps' Mini-Vans

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 20

 BODY:
The Commerce Department issued a preliminary ruling today that Japanese mini-vans were being sold for less than fair value in the United States. But the agency said they were being underpriced by less than Detroit's auto makers had contended.
The ruling that the Japanese were "dumping," as the practice is known, came as the United States trade deficit with Japan is increasingly becoming a political issue in the approaching Presidential primaries. Hours before the Commerce Department delivered its verdict, several Democratic leaders in Congress from car-producing states proposed legislation to limit Japanese auto makers' sales in the United States. 
 The ruling also came as Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher, President Bush's close friend and future chairman of his re-election campaign, has arranged for the chief executives of the Big Three to accompany the President on his planned trip to Japan, New Zealand, Australia and Singapore.
The Commerce Department declined to comment on whether Mr. Mosbacher played any role in today's decision. Similar suits have been resolved by having junior officials plug the prices of each part and other expenses into an elaborate computer model and then wading through the printouts.
Most of this process is determined by law, although many decisions must be made along the way, such as which parts are considered standard equipment and the expenses associated with large volume sales to auto rental companies. Commerce secretaries have traditionally avoided participating in these many small decisions because rulings in trade cases often become the basis of extensive legislation.
The preliminary ruling today found that a duty of 7.19 percent should be imposed on imports of the Mazda MPV and a duty of 0.95 percent on the Toyota Previa. Both companies must pay these duties either in cash or by posting a bond until the issuance of a final ruling, expected on May 31. The International Trade Commission, an semi-independent agency that reports to both the Congress and the President, would then have to certify by July 15 that the Japanese imports were also financially hurting the American companies before permanent duties could be collected.
The United States recession has resulted in heavy losses for American car makers and made it easier for them to prove that such injury occurred. Detroit's high profits in the late 1980's had discouraged the Big Three from filing trade cases until now.
Any other Japanese company that enters the United States mini-van market before the final ruling comes out will be charged a duty of 4.23 percent, which is a weighted average of the Mazda and Toyota duties.
 
Victory Is Claimed by Mazda
 Mazda claimed victory in today's ruling, pointing out that Detroit had sought duties of nearly 30 percent. Detroit auto makers said they welcomed the ruling but hoped that the final determination next year would result in higher tariffs.
Anti-dumping cases of the sort brought by the Big Three this year against Mazda and Toyota are allowed by legislation that seeks to prevent foreign companies from using profits in their home countries to subsidize exports until they cripple competitors or drive them out of business. But some economists contend that anti-dumping legislation is a way for powerful industries to win protection at the expense of consumers, who benefit from low-priced imports.
Today, the House majority leader, Richard A. Gephardt, Democrat of Missouri; Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., Democrat of Michigan, and four other representatives from Michigan announced that they would introduce legislation imposing limits on imports of Japanese cars if the bilateral trade deficit does not fall enough.
The six legislators from car-producing states called for a cap on most sales of cars made by Japanese companies. The cap would include not only imported cars but also some of the cars produced by Japanese-owned factories in the United States.
The bill bears some similarities to the proposal Mr. Gephardt made as a Presidential candidate in 1988, and the heat of today's rhetoric was reminiscent of that campaign. Jobs in the auto and auto parts industries "are the ladders families in America climb to reach for the American dream," Mr. Gephardt said.
The Administration greeted the proposal coldly. Mr. Mosbacher told a press briefing at the White House that he understood the frustration of Congress with Japan's persistent trade surpluses. But he added, "The way to do this is by letting Japan know that they're out of step, as far as a trading partner, with the rest of the world, and we hope and believe that they will see it's time to do it, not to mandate it legislatively."
The Japanese Embassy in Washington also criticized the plan. "The introduction of the unilateral measures or the introduction of artificial quotas are not welcome," Hiroshi Hirabayashi, the embassy's deputy chief of mission, said at a news briefing today. "It's against the interests of not only the exporters but also the consumers of importing countries."
 
Legislation Prospects Unclear
 Prospects for the legislation are unclear, particularly as long as General Motors maintains its recent uncertainty about whether to seek legislative responses to the success of Japanese car imports. Although Mr. Gephardt and his colleagues have been drafting today's bill since February and consulted with the auto companies repeatedly, General Motors said in a statement today that it was not ready to comment on the legislation because it needed time to study the document.
By contrast, Toyota immediately criticized the bill for including some cars produced by the Japanese in the United States. The bill would "force lay-offs by labeling work done by American employees at the newest and most productive auto plants in the U.S. as 'foreign' labor, pitting one American community against another," Toyota's American subsidiary, Toyota Motor Sales, said in a statement.

HEADLINE: A Fed Grasp For The Reins

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 20

 BODY:
The striking action of the Federal Reserve today in pushing the interest rates it directly controls to their lowest levels since the 1960's may have been a desperate attempt to wrest control of the economy back from the politicians.
For almost a decade, the dominant view in Washington has been that the astronomical budget deficit means that the White House and Congress have no leeway to cut taxes or increase spending, the normal Government response to bad times. Only the Federal Reserve through its monetary policy, the thinking went, could keep the economy on its feet. 
 But the Fed's steady decrease in interest rates since 1989 seems to have been inadequate. And recently, within the central bank and among economists across most of the ideological spectrum, the sense has been growing that President Bush and the Democrats who control Congress would try to fight the recession next year with a pre-election bidding war over tax giveaways.
The result, these experts fear, could be a new spike in the deficit, already approaching a stratospheric $400 billion this year, a situation that could cause serious long-term damage to the economy.
Testifying Wednesday before the House Ways and Means Committee, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Board chairman, conceded that earlier this year he had miscalculated the strength of the economic recovery and said that the economy now was clearly struggling. But he cautioned the legislators against a "quick fix" and encouraged them to let the business cycle run its course.
To many authorities, by cutting the discount rate a full percentage point, the largest one-day drop in more than 10 years, Mr. Greenspan was basically saying to the politicians: "I'm in command. Trust me."
The theory may have been that such a large rate reduction would convince the public and politicians that someone in the Government was taking bold steps to address the economic misery.
Still, it may be too late to head off the politicians. Under President Bush, the nation's economy has grown a total of less than 1 percent in the last three years, the slowest three-year run in almost half a century except for the back-to-back recessions in 1980 and 1982. Democrats and Republicans alike have urged the Federal Reserve to act more forcefully. But until today, Mr. Greenspan had insisted on incremental reductions in interest rates, a quarter of a point or half a point at a time.
Now the politicians seem determined to move first thing next year. Incumbents simply cannot sit silent when their constituents are troubled. They must fire their ammunition even if the target is out of range .
This illustrates the difference in the world views of politicians and economists.
The White House and Congress, on the verge of an election year, look at what was announced this week: General Motors said it would close 21 plants in the United States and Canada over the next few years and eliminate more than 70,000 jobs; industrial production, one of the main measurements of current business activity, fell by an unanticipated four-tenths of 1 percent in November, and housing starts are off by so much that the worst year for home builders since World War II is a cinch.
The politician's instinct is to try to drive the country out of recession by cutting taxes and increasing consumption. Consumption, incidentally, is already running at about 67 percent of the country's total production, close to an all-time high.
Economists, who do not have to worry about elections, look at the numbers and see a relatively mild recession. "It's hard to see what all the shouting is about," said Benjamin M. Friedman, a professor of political economy at Harvard.
 
A Matter of Perception
 The real problem, in the view of Mr. Greenspan, Mr. Friedman and most other economists, is that the long-term prospects for the economy are poor unless the deficit can be reduced and savings, investment and productivity increased. The despair the politicians observe, these economists say, is caused not by the sharp pain of relatively few people today but by the nagging fear of many millions, perhaps justified, that they will not do as well as their parents and that their children will be even worse off.
So the economists believe it would be foolish for the President and Congress to approve a package of politically popular but probably counterproductive measures to give the economy a quick kick but cause long-term weakness.
No one on the outside knows what goes on in the Federal Reserve's board room. But the speculation around the capital and on Wall Street is that Mr. Greenspan, who has close ties to the Bush Administration, had wanted to move more aggressively for some time but had been thwarted by other members of the Reserve Board.
As evidence, those who hold this view observe that Wayne D. Angell voted against today's rate cuts and that two other members -- John P. LaWare and Edward W. Kelley Jr. -- have dissented in other instances recently. A fourth member, David W. Mullins, said in a speech last week that the economy was really not so bad, on balance. The other two members, Susan M. Phillips and Lawrence B. Lindsey, did not join the board until last month and cast their first votes this week.
One of the most politically savvy economists around, Robert D. Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office, suggested in an interview that the Federal Reserve's moves today might help head off ill-advised legislation by giving cover to politicians who do not want to shoot from the hip.
One such politician, Representative Leon E. Panetta, the California Democrat who heads the House Budget Committee, thought it might indeed bolster his position. "If it pushes down long-term interest rates," Mr. Panetta said today, "it is my hope that Congress and the President will be able to focus on measures to promote long-term economic growth rather than a short-term quick fix."

HEADLINE: Dow Up 20.12, to 2,934.48, in Busy Day

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stocks closed broadly higher yesterday in the heaviest trading in nearly a year, as investors took the Federal Reserve's rate cut as a signal that it was serious about jolting the economy to life. The Dow Jones industrial average advanced to 2,934.48, up 20.12 points for the day and the week.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 318.4 million, barely eclipsed by the 318.9 million shares traded on Jan. 17, the day after the Persian Gulf war started. There were nearly twice as many advancing issues as losing ones on the Big Board: 1,138 to 618. 
 Peter G. Grennan, senior vice president and head of stock index futures trading at Shearson Lehman Brothers, said yesterday's market was a little more than technical. It was not only influenced by the "triple witching" -- the expiration of options on individual stock, index and futures contracts during the last hour of trading, but also by the Fed's cut in the discount rate, he said, adding, "And it was difficult to figure which played the more important role."
The New York composite was up 2.22, to 213.13, and the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 4.52, to 387.04. On the American Stock Exchange, the composite rose 0.62, to 367.22.
Trading on the Nasdaq was also active and moved the composite up 1.23, to 535.76, while the Russell 2,000, an indicator of smaller issues, slipped 0.13, to 176.07.
Traders said buying was seen across most of the market, particularly in issues influenced by interest rates.
Wall Street stocks surged at the opening on news that the Fed had lowered the discount rate by one percentage point, to 3 1/2 percent.
Some analysts doubted that the rally could be sustained, citing the triple witching, which normally adds volatility to trading, and year-end selling by investors for tax purposes. In addition, they said the cut in the rate, the largest since 1981, would increase concern over the economy.
With the discount rate now at its lowest level since 1964, stocks eased off session highs but remained firm through the day, as a strong bond market added support.
The rate cut "clearly indicated that the Federal Reserve is deeply concerned about the failure of the economy to make a recovery," said Hugh A. Johnson, a senior vice president of the First Albany Corporation.
Elsewhere in the market, Nicolet Instrument said it expected its stock price to recover after investors assess the company's statement that its fiscal 1992 year-end earnings will not reach the previously expected record levels. Trading was halted yesterday at 1:58 P.M. for about a half-hour on order imbalances, meaning that there was an excess of buy or sell orders that was almost impossible to match with its opposite. The stock closed down 4 3/8, at 11 7/8.
Traders said Scimed Life Systems, which makes coronary angioplasty catheters, rose 5 3/8, to 73 1/2, after it reported better-than-expected results for the third quarter. Scimed said that excluding a $28 million charge from the settlement of patent litigation with Eli Lilly, the company's operating profits had more than doubled.
A number of analysts raised their ratings and earnings estimates for the company yesterday.
Lockheed fell 1 3/8, to 43 5/8, as Steven Binder, an analyst at Bear, Stearns, cut its rating to "avoid," from "hold," traders said.
In other activity, Amgen and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation both gained, as they will both soon be added to the S.& P. 500 index. Amgen rose 2 to close at 60 1/4, and Freddie Mac gained 4 1/8, to 108 3/8.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Toys 'R' Us Opens Doors in Japan

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 20

 BODY:
Toys "R" Us opened its first store in Japan today, and judging by the 17,000 people who showed up, an American company may have finally found a weapon to crack the formidable Japanese market. It's called children.
In the first half-hour after the doors opened at 10 A.M. in the suburban hamlet of Amimachi, 1,500 people arrived, many of them mothers and grandmothers led by their pint-size charges. They made their way through the gymnasium-size structure, eyeing the Barbie and Ken dolls, battery-powered fire engines and Pampers lining aisles nearly as wide as many residential streets in Japan. 
 The layout is nearly identical to most of Toys "R" Us's American stores, with one big difference: shoplifting is so rare in Japan that there are no hidden cameras and few other security measures.
"I get disoriented from all of this merchandise," said a young father, who appeared on one of the numerous evening news programs highlighting the opening. "There's too much."
The warehouse-like approach and big discounts of the Paramus, N.J., chain are revolutionary for the consumer-backward Japanese retailing industry. Retailing here is tied up by a labyrinthine distribution system that forces consumers to pay among the highest prices in the world.
"This is a breakthrough for Japan," said Takayuki Suzuki, a retailing analyst at Merrill Lynch Japan and a former department store executive. "It is going to make one of the most backward parts of the economy more efficient."
For Toys "R" Us to win approval to put its store in Amimachi, about an hour and a half from Tokyo by train, took a three-year battle with everything from national laws to protective local business councils. Bitter trade negotiations between the United States and Japan also played a part.
More than a third of the 15,000 products in the store are imported -- though not all from the United States -- far more than in the average Japanese toy store. The company expects that figure to increase to 50 percent shortly.
There is still some heated opposition to the changes. Small toy merchants in some instances have slowed the opening of what the company hopes will be 100 stores over the next decade and have forced reductions in the size of the sites.
In some ways, Friday's Toys "R" Us opening has turned the tables in the trade wars, with Japanese companies now charging that a big, well-financed foreigner was forcing them out of business with predatory methods.
"Honestly speaking, I have to say I am mad at them and what they are doing," said Akira Namba, executive secretary of the Japan Association of Specialty Toy Retailers. "They press for everyone to do things the American way."
 
Dealing With Manufacturers
 One key to the Toys "R" Us formula is that as the largest toy retailer in the world, it has the muscle to go around wholesalers and deal directly with manufacturers. That cuts costs and gives it a big competitive advantage, something unheard of in Japan. It was considered a watershed when Toys "R" Us secured an agreement from Nintendo, the booming Japanese computer game company, to buy direct.
The company says more than 50 other Japanese toy makers have made similar deals and that others will in time, which may sound the death knell for smaller merchants that cannot offer the variety or discounts of Toys "R" Us.
"Look, this isn't the first time we're meeting a lot of these people," Robert C. Nakasone, the company's vice chairman, said of the Japanese toy makers. "I think we're going to be able to resolve all of these issues very favorably."
Still, what it took to open the store is an important illustration of what really causes change in Japan and who generally benefits the most.
Unquestionably, American pressure on the Japanese Government forced an easing of the laws that had made it extremely difficult for retailers to open large stores, and the no-nonsense executives of Toys "R" Us were among those giving the negotiators the most encouragement.
 
Bush Coming to Next Opening
 So proud are American officials of this achievement that President Bush is expected to fly next month to the opening of Toys "R" Us's second Japanese store, in western Japan near the historic city of Nara.
But what made the American pressure so effective was that many Japanese Government officials were already convinced that the changes were needed. The vocal battling by the United States during what was known as the Structural Impediments Initiative, or S.I.I., talks, helped the Japanese bureaucracy overcome domestic resistance from entrenched smaller merchants.
"Before, we had a proposal for these changes, but without a timetable," said Hajime Furuta, director of the Distribution Industries division at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. "S.I.I. gave us a timetable. Because we had already discussed this at length, we had a good idea of what we wanted to do."
Of course, those areas where there is no such common interest are the ones in which the Japanese fight hardest and give the least ground to the United States.
 
Benefits for Japanese
 Although it is little discussed, the greatest beneficiaries of the legal changes have thus been Japanese retailers. Before the law was eased, the Government approved usually fewer than 600 new applications a year for large retail stores, and some of those had taken 10 years to be completed. Over the last year, 3,000 new applications have been approved, of which the overwhelming majority are Japanese.
Asked how many foreigners were showing an interest, Mr. Furuta said, "Very few, unfortunately."
"We're sort of surprised that we haven't had any inquiries yet," an American official said. "If Toys 'R' Us does not make it, I don't think you're going to see many others." The exceptionally high land prices and complex distribution system have deterred American retailers.
But there is a reward for those who, like Toys "R" Us, can afford years of red ink before turning a profit. Japan's consumers are used to paying exceedingly rich prices, particularly for toys. Toys "R" Us can thus offer discounts but still earn much larger margins than in the United States.
 
Discount on Barbie
 A Barbie doll (the same blond, blue-eyed darling that is sold in the United States) packaged in a costume ball gown goes for the equivalent of $19.52 at the new Toys "R" Us. The doll is $26.50 at a large Japanese store, but the price is just $14.99 in the United States.
A package of four containers of Play Doh is $6 at Toys "R" Us, $7.50 in a Japanese store and $2.69 in the United States.
Some goods, like the high-end Aprica baby stroller, made in Japan, are actually cheaper at Japanese discounters than at Toys "R" Us.
But Toys "R" Us did strike a tactical success in finding a strong local partner to help it negotiate the bureaucracy as well as find good sites. Its Japanese subsidiary is 20 percent owned by McDonald's Company (Japan) Ltd., which has the license for operating the American fast-food restaurants in Japan.
 
McDonald's Came From U.S.?
 Under the control of Den Fujita, a well-known entrepreneur, McDonald's has enjoyed such success here that some younger Japanese are surprised to learn the chain originated in the United States.
The partnership has helped both companies. Most of the shopping centers being built with local partners around Toys "R" Us outlets will include a McDonald's, as well as an outlet of another American franchise Mr. Fujita controls in Japan, Blockbuster Video.
"The concept is brilliant, even in Japan," said Mike Allen, the retailing analyst at Barclays de Zoette Wedd Securities here. "People have already shown that when they are given a choice they are willing to drive or whatever to get discounts. The problem before was not tradition or culture, but that they had no choice."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Tumbles in Reaction To Cut in the Discount Rate

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell sharply yesterday in reaction to cuts in two key interest rates, which makes the United States currency less attractive to investors.
Gold rose $1.40 on the Commodity Exchange in New York, closing at $358.60 an ounce. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $358.50, up $1.00. 
 The Federal Reserve stepped up its battle to revive the economy by cutting its discount rate, the interest it charges when it lends to banks, from 4 1/2 percent to 3 1/2 percent, the lowest rate in a quarter century.
The central bank also signaled that it had lowered the target for the Federal funds rate, the interest that banks charge each other, from 4 1/2 percent to 4 percent. It marked the 15th time the Fed had pushed this rate lower since the recession began in July 1990.
The nation's largest bank, Citicorp, and several other banks announced they would cut their prime rates, the benchmark for many consumer and business loans, from 7 1/2 percent to 6 1/2 percent, the lowest level since 1977. "The dollar plummeted on news of today's interest rate cuts," said Scott Knous, an analyst with Thomson Financial Networks.
Lower rates mean investments in dollar-denominated securities like Treasury bonds are worth less in relation to those denominated in other currencies.
The drop in interest rates followed the move by Germany's central bank on Thursday to increase that nation's rates, further widening the difference in rates between the nations and supporting the mark.
The dollar fell more than 2 pfennigs, to 1.5340 marks in New York, from 1.5575 marks late Thursday. In European trading, the dollar fetched 1.5335 German marks, down from 1.5730.
The dollar fell to 127.55 yen from 128.15 yen in late New York trading. In Tokyo overnight, the dollar had fallen 0.38 yen, to a closing 128.32 yen. Later, in London, it was quoted at 127.45 yen.
The British pound rose to $1.8585 in New York from $1.8365. In London, one pound cost $1.8618, more expensive than $1.8253 late Thursday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's prices, included 1.3630 Swiss francs, down from 1.3805; 5.2455 French francs, down from 5.3255; 1,165.75 Italian lire, down from 1,180.25, and 1.1553 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1565.
Silver closed at $3.839 an ounce on the Commodity Exchange, up from $3.827 late Thursday.

Heating Oil Prices Plunge In Mild Start to U.S. Winter

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Heating oil futures fell to a 17-month low yesterday on the New York Mercantile Exchange because of abundant supplies and slack demand resulting from unseasonably warm weather. Other energy futures also fell.
Heating oil for January delivery plunged 2.38 cents to 51.08 cents a gallon, the lowest settlement of a near-term heating oil contract since July 11, 1990, when near-term deliveries finished at 50.38 cents. 
 Crude oil for February delivery fell 60 cents, to $18.52 a barrel. January unleaded gasoline dropped 1.33 cents, to 52.24 cents a gallon, and February natural gas fell 2.2 cents, to $1.453 for 1,000 cubic feet.
Wholesale heating oil prices have plummeted by 29 percent since Nov. 4, when near-term deliveries traded near 72 cents a gallon.
 
Inventories Built Up
 At that time, refiners building up inventories for the winter produced extra heating oil in case the Soviet Union was unable to export enough fuel oil to satisfy Europe's demand.
But Soviet exports to Europe have been unimpeded by the country's transition of power. Meanwhile, winter in the United States is off to an unusually mild start, resulting in large domestic supplies.
"This is a classic situation of the trade preparing too much for the heating oil season," said Gerald Samuels, managing director of ARB Oil Inc., a New York trading company.
Bob Baker, energy analyst with Prudential Securities Inc., said the weak economy has also hurt heating oil because it is used as diesel fuel. With industry in a slump, fewer trucks are rolling on the highways.
Cattle futures extended Thursday's sharp losses on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in a continued reaction to an Agriculture Department report suggesting a backlog of slaughter-ready cattle. Pork futures were narrowly mixed.
Live cattle for February delivery dropped 0.78 cent, to 69.37 cents a pound. January feeder cattle fell 0.85 cent, to 76.15 cents a pound. December live hogs rose 0.15 cent, to 41.32 cents a pound, and February frozen pork bellies fell 0.35 cent, to 36.75 cents a pound.
December gold futures rose $1.40, to $358.60 a troy ounce; December silver rose 1.2 cents, to $3.839 a troy ounce.
Grain and soybean futures ended mostly higher on the Chicago Board of Trade. Analysts said foreign demand for American agricultural products could grow as a result of lower interest rates and a weaker dollar.
March wheat rose 3 3/4 cents, to $3.90 1/2 a bushel. March corn rose 1/2 cent, to $2.53 3/4 a bushel, and March oats rose 1/4 cent at $1.35 a bushel.

HEADLINE: Fed's Interest-Rate Cuts Welcomed by Business

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
From chief executives to car dealers, business people across the country welcomed the Federal Reserve's sharp cut in interest rates yesterday as a dramatic confidence-building gesture that should help revive the sluggish economy.
No policy move, they stressed, could be expected to reverse, single-handed, the reluctance of consumers and companies to spend and invest. But they added that the Fed's action did show that Washington was concerned about the economy and was making a concerted effort to turn things around. 
"It's a good sign," said John B. McCoy, chairman of Banc One Corporation, the big bank based in Columbus, Ohio, which cut its prime lending rate yesterday after the Fed move. "They're dead serious, and they're trying to get this thing fixed."
 
The Biggest Winners
 The Fed's decision to cut the discount rate by a full percentage point, to a 27-year low of 3 1/2 percent, will ease the borrowing costs for all businesses, because most loan charges are tied to that rate. The biggest winners should be those most sensitive to interest-rate swings, like home builders and small companies.
But the business people noted that a lack of confidence in the economy, not borrowing costs, appeared to be the main stumbling block to a recovery. "The real thing that's going to end this recession is for the consumer to have enough confidence in his economic future to spend again," said Frank Anderson Jr., a Chevrolet dealer in Raleigh, N.C., whose car sales are down more than 30 percent this year. "The rate cut seems to be intended as a confidence builder, but it will take a while to get to the man or woman on the street."
 
A Cycle of Fear
 W. John Devine, the chairman of Child World Inc., a toy retailer based in Avon, Mass., said consumer confidence was undermined by the steady stream of layoff announcements recently. "Some people are losing their jobs and many more are afraid of losing their jobs," he said, "and spending isn't going to bounce back until that cycle of fear is broken."
Though not immediately, consumers should soon see the benefits of lower rates. For example, the millions of American homeowners who hold adjustable-rate mortgages will find that their monthly payments are reduced the next time the rate is reset. Those mortgage rates are usually linked to rates on one-year Treasury bills, which have dropped two and a half percentage points in the last year.
The effect of lower mortgage payments on recent home buyers will be the equivalent of two weeks' additional pay, estimates David Wyss, research director of DRI--McGraw Hill Inc., an economic consulting firm. "That should be when consumers feel the big effect," he said.
 
Renegotiating Mortgages
 Homeowners with fixed-rate mortgages are renegotiating loans at a record pace to take advantage of falling interest costs. "We're refinancing so many mortgages we can't keep up with the paperwork," said Mr. McCoy of Banc One.
Lower rates should also help American exporters. Lower interest rates weaken the value of the dollar, making United States exports cheaper for foreign buyers and increasing the cost of imported goods for Americans. Already, exports have been a source of strength for the otherwise weak American economy, with the sales of goods and services increasing 8.5 percent over the last year, said Edward McKelvey, an economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company.
 
Good for U.S. Exports
 The Fed cut, combined with the German central bank's decision on Thursday to raise its rates, should serve to enhance the competitiveness of American goods even more. "It's terrific; it should definitely help American exports," said Brian McLaughlin, president of the Hurco Companies, an Indianapolis machine-tool maker that gets half of its $82 million-a-year business from overseas sales.
The depression in real estate, especially along the two coasts, has contributed considerably to the recession. Lower interest costs should help builders and developers, but the trend of declining rates has not revived construction up to now. "It helps in reducing the cost of financing, but it doesn't fill the buildings," said David Shulman, a real estate analyst at Salomon Brothers.
There are an estimated 515 million square feet of vacant office space in the 50 largest American cities, or a 19.5 percent vacancy rate, about twice normal levels. "So lower rates will ultimately help the commercial real estate market, but it has taken a lot longer than in previous recessions," Mr. Shulman said.
The residential market is also mired in a slump. Falling rates are helpful, but they may no longer be the key factor in building activity, said Michael Hobbs, a residential contractor in Connecticut. "The two key elements in consumer confidence are your home and your job, and I can't think of a time when people have been less certain about the security of their job or the value of their home," Mr. Hobbs said.
That mentality, he said, had to shift before people would invest in real estate again. "The money is out there, but it's sure not flowing," Mr. Hobbs said.

Nets Fail To Confuse The Bulls

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J., Dec. 20

 BODY:
Bill Fitch remained as coach of the New Jersey Nets tonight, the Nets held in their confused and losing pattern and a sellout crowd hardly seemed to notice, as all eyes were trained on Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls, who bullied the Nets, 115-98.
Jordan, the man who defies gravity, also conquered the Byrne Meadowlands Arena laws of nature, filling it for pro basketball for the first time this season with 20,049 fans. Two were named Marla Maples and her date, Donald Trump, the fourth-row guests of minority Nets' owner Joe Taub. 
 While Taub would not comment if Trump had advised him on the Art of the Deal, he did have much to say on his failed attempt to land Jim Valvano on the Nets' bench, replacing embattled Coach Bill Fitch.
"I was not only authorized to meet with Jim Valvano, but all the other owners knew about it and Jerry Cohen was with me," Taub said, referring to the club's president and one of its seven board of directors. Asked how his story could be so contrary to the one presented to the media Wednesday by Alan Aufzien, one of two majority owners, Taub insisted: "I'm telling you the truth."
The truth about Fitch's status -- and Valvano's, for that matter -- remained elusive, with Fitch saying he hoped that the coach's trapdoor would remain closed for a while so the club "could get back to concentrating on basketball." On Valvano, to whom Taub reportedly offered a five-year deal worth almost $3 million last Monday, or any other potential successor to Fitch, Taub said, "Right now I'm in a holding pattern."
All he knows, he said, is that the majority owners, Aufzien and David Gerstein, who invited him to rejoin the board last spring as an adviser in basketball-related decisions, pulled the rug out from under him, causing him "considerable embarrassment."
Asked why he made the offer if he only had the authority to speak with Valvano, Taub said, "This is something new for me. I had control when I was here before. It's very difficult to work under these conditions."
He hinted that he would be interested in regaining controlling interest of the team, which he had until the mid-1980's. Failing that, he said he might sell his interest.
Aufzien also attended the game, but did not appear to speak with reporters. Taub said the two said hello, but did not discuss the Valvano debacle. "I was busy with Donald and Marla," he said of the on-again, off-again, on-again couple, strangely similar to the Nets and their organizational decision-making process.
 (Meanwhile, Saturday's edition of The Charlotte Observer reported that Valvano had agreed late tonight to become the Nets coach.)
 
Another Recession
 The Nets, meanwhile, continued in their perpetual state of recession. Their most encouraging time tonight came with 3 1/2 minutes remaining in the first half, when they took a 44-37 lead over the Bulls, who had fallen into a lull with Michael Jordan resting and Scottie Pippen sitting next to His Airness (as the result of a few ill-advised solo attempts).
But with both future United States Olympians back in the lineup, the Bulls snapped to and snapped the Nets out of whatever dream they might have been entertaining. Two Jordan free throws began a 9-0 run, with Jordan and Pippen each contributing long jumpers, and Jordan finding Horace Grant, who scored a team-high 28 points, for a fast-break dunk that punctuated the rally and gave the Bulls a 3-point halftime lead.
"Their defense just picked up," Sam Bowie said. "I know a lot of people come out to see Michael take off from the free-throw line but what impresses me most is their defense, their rotations and how they help out whenever there's a mismatch."
There was only one mismatch in the third quarter, and that was between New Jersey and Chicago. Jumpers by John Paxson and Jordan got the Bulls off on a 17-6 tear, and the only unanswered question from there was whether the Nets could crack 100 points against one of five National Basketball Association defenses that on average hold their opponents to double figures.
They couldn't.

 
 
REBOUNDS
 One of the Nets' minority owners, DONALD UNGER, who owns 4 percent of the team, said he is interested in selling his shares . . . MICHAEL JORDAN scored 24 points; MOOKIE BLAYLOCK led the Nets with 18. KENNY ANDERSON played 18 minutes, missing all 7 of his shots.

HEADLINE: Critic's Notebook;
When Broadcast Matter Is Considered Offensive

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
The ball is over; the mask comes off, but the music lingers. There, from behind the blob, emerges Patricia Bowman, former Alleged Victim and accuser of William K. Smith in the rape trial that resulted a week ago in his instant acquittal. And there, on a San Francisco news program is the President of the United States sharing his worry "about so much filth and indecent material coming in through the airwaves and through these trials into people's homes."
Should the entire trial have been blobbed out? Should Ms. Bowman's face and name have been left in? What are Ms. Bowman and Mr. Bush trying to tell the nation? 
 Mr. Bush's expression of worry was delivered Tuesday in a batch of quickie television interviews with local news anchors in selected markets, mainly devoted to a revelation that struck him on the road to the Presidential campaign: the country is really in a recession. His reference to the Smith trial may be taken as condolence to the unemployed for having their minds polluted while sitting home all day with nothing better to do than stare at the tube. (Did Mr. Bush himself spend a lot of time watching the Palm Beach story? Or did Marlin Fitzwater have all the fun?)
The President did not recommend that the jobless find something more wholesome to occupy them, like shopping at J. C. Penney and giving a lift to the economy; his point was that CNN and Court Television should not have shown the Kennedy trial. The man who had benefited from some of the dirtier uses of the tube in campaign history was offended.
In accord with the prevailing principle, borrowed from the left, that every disagreement comes down to an issue of "rights," Mr. Bush advanced the following startling proposition: "I think the American people have a right to be protected against some of these excesses. While people have a right to a fair trial, I think the American people have an overriding right to let those matters be decided behind closed doors."
Now that is revolutionary: The President of the United States, guardian of the Constitution, invoking the citizenry's right to be protected against being informed. The possibilities are tremendous: If television news stopped carrying those interviews with people on unemployment lines, the nation would not be feeling so low. If only all news could be controlled like the coverage of the war against Iraq, this would be an era of uplift.
Is it necessary to point out that the Kennedy-Smith trial was a true news event? A serious charge was brought against a member of a prominent political family, raising issues of wide interest and concern. Granted, it also stirred prurient juices, but CNN and Court Television presented the proceedings in a straightforward, sober way. The suggestion that news organizations be cracked down on because some people, even the President, might not like what is being reported and others might like it in undesirable ways does not spring from the Bill of Rights.
As for Ms. Bowman, even before her appearance Thursday night on "Prime Time Live," the round-faced, brown-haired young woman could be seen on CNN, "A Current Affair" and elsewhere. But in a scoop for Diane Sawyer, it was only on ABC that face, name and voice came together in an on-screen interview.
With the exception of NBC News, television, like most of the press, respected Ms. Bowman's desire for a degree of anonymity, even though everybody in Palm Beach must have known who she was by the start of the trial. As long as stigma attaches to a woman who says she has been raped, the voluntary decision to conceal her identity seems an act of chivalry. And if such protection reassures women who might otherwise be reluctant to come forward, so much the better. If it encourages dubious charges, so much the worse. More important, the jurors were able to see both accuser and accused.
Whether the blobbing helped or hurt Ms. Bowman's image and the image of other alleged rape victims is as unclear as her television image itself. One viewer might feel sympathy for a woman trying to keep some semblance of privacy after the humiliation of what she said she had been through; another might wonder what she is hiding. Court Television's electronic checkerboard made her seem like a creature from space.
So what did the newly unveiled Ms. Bowman have to tell Ms. Sawyer? Not much about that night. On introduction, the camera moved slowly up her torso, past the crucifix -- and there was the face. That was the big moment. For the next half hour, in response to the sympathetically skeptical questioning of Ms. Sawyer, Ms. Bowman filled in no memory gaps and delivered again the phrases ("He raped me") and tears that had failed to persuade the jury in West Palm Beach. Seeing her face probably did not change many opinions: Viewers who had detected a ring of truth behind the blob could hear it still; those who had been jarred by the clang of an improbable script would be jarred again.
One can only speculate on her motives for coming out. (Roy E. Black, Mr. Smith's lawyer, may have asked for it by telling reporters and talk-show hosts that the accuser was "disturbed.") But the motives of "Prime Time Live" are plain enough. What program could resist the opportunity to be first with Ms. Bowman and squeeze a little more mileage out of the case before audience interest waned, even if that meant yet again airing accusations against a man who had just won acquittal? Not the worst treatment of the case the tube has carried but far from the best, it served "Prime Time's" ratings, at the expense of Mr. Smith.
Evidently ABC lawyers are not worried about a threat from Mr. Smith's lawyers that Ms. Bowman's account might now be considered libelous, but Thursday's edition of "Prime Time Live" was the sort of trivial scoop, with a flimsy pretext of news, that lends plausibility to Mr. Bush's pieties.

HEADLINE: For Car Renters, New Options for Insurance

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
In the consumer jungle of automobile rentals, the foliage is getting thicker.
The issue is insurance. Until recently, renters faced a simple question: Do I want it or not? Many consumer advocates say such coverage is a very poor deal and should probably be turned down. 
 "As an insurance product, it's very unlikely to be worthwhile," said Stephen C. Burgess, the Florida Insurance Department's consumer advocate.
The rental companies, hearing the complaints, have recently responded by presenting customers with as many as three coverage choices. But some of those choices may be even worse deals for the renter than the old option.
For the last 20 years, the conventional pattern at car-rental counters was to push hard to sell the renter what most companies call the collision damage waiver, an extra-cost clause in the rental contract that puts the financial responsibility for accidents on the rental company, not the driver. Others use different names for this coverage but never officially "insurance," because that would make the clause subject to state regulation.
Whatever it is called, it is generally extremely expensive, often $14 a day to cover the value of the car. The Hertz Corporation, the nation's largest car-rental company, estimates that the cost to the rental companies is only $1.50 to $2 a day.
Worse, it may be nearly worthless to the renter, because the insurance policy on the car that the renter left at home in the driveway will often cover the rental car, too.
Collision damage waivers have been criticized over the years as providing "a huge profit center," said Liz Clark, a spokeswoman for Alamo Rent A Car, which is the nation's fifth-largest car-rental company. So 18 months ago, Alamo came out with a new set of offerings called Waiver Savers. Stepping off the shuttle bus from the Orlando, Fla., airport, a traveler arriving at Alamo's counters will wait in line and get a sales pitch from an overhead video monitor.
The videotape points out that many people who have car insurance of their own face a $500 deductible. For $3, Alamo will sell the renter the first $500 of coverage, reducing the deductible to zero. Or if a renter wants a little more coverage, perhaps because it is a business rental and the rental contract covers all but the first $3,000, Alamo will sell $3,000 in coverage for $6.
For customers who want full insurance, because their own policies are not applicable or because they are afraid to file a claim under them, Alamo charges $9. The tape also plays down the value of insurance that applies automatically when certain credit cards are used, pointing out that in most cases such insurance is secondary, leaving drivers to try to collect under their own policies first.
The benefit of buying coverage at the rental counter, Ms. Clark said, is "peace of mind."
That may be, because for the renter, the boon does not appear to be financial.
 
$6 vs. 60 Cents
 Although the price tags are smaller on the new coverage options, the lowest one has become substantially less economical. Selling coverage of $500 for one day at $3 means that the company is charging $6 for $1,000 worth of insurance. Before Alamo introduced its menu, it was charging a tenth that amount -- about 60 cents a day per $1,000 -- or $14 for full coverage on a full-size car.
But, Ms. Clark pointed out, "$3 is negligible compared to the cost of a vacation." The policies sell well, she added.
Hertz still offers full protection at $12 a day, but responding to the competition, it has added a $1,000 option in Florida, priced at $5 a day. Again, the new choice means less expense for the renter, but it also represents a higher cost for $1,000 worth of coverage: $5 vs. about 50 cents.
A spokesman for Hertz, Joseph M. Russo, agreed that neither deal was particularly attractive from the customer's point of view. "That's why Hertz supports the elimination of the collision damage waiver," he said.
The company was a backer of a New York State law, which went into effect in 1989, that eliminated the waiver, making insurance part of the basic cost of renting a car. Illinois also bans waivers.
 
Loss of Rental Income
 The Budget Rent-A-Car Corporation still offers the collision damage waiver, but it points out that the waiver has its advantages. Budget, among other companies, charges for the loss of rental income when one of its cars is in the body shop for accident repairs. Tim Hermeling, a spokesman for Budget, said the collision damage waiver would cover loss of use.
"We believe it should be handled similarly to airline insurance," Mr. Hermeling said of rental-car coverage. "It's there if you want it. If you don't want it, don't take it."
Mr. Burgess, the Florida consumer advocate, would like to bring all damage clauses under state regulation, like other insurance. "It walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, but it's not a duck," he said.
He will try again in the next session of the Florida Legislature, he said, but is not optimistic. The car-rental companies, he said, "have a lot more clout than a lot of people."

Chart: "There's No Such Thing as a Free Ride"
 
Drivers who rent from off-airport rental companies should think twice before boarding the "free" shuttle bus.
 A growing number of airports impose a tax of up to 10 percent on all off-airport rentals by customers arriving by shuttle bys. Some companies do not list the charge separately.
 Rental companies that operate on airport property have lobbied for this. They point out that they must pay a commission to the airport, typically 10 percent, and argue that taxing their off-airport competitors dimply provides a level playing field. The off-airport companies say that renters are being taxed without benefiting. Customers can often avoid the tax by taking a cab to the off-airport rental companies, presenting their receipts as proof. The cab fare is usually less than $5, and the trip is often faster. For a rental of a week or more, this can save money
 
Auto Rental News, a trade magazine, has compiled a list of airports that impose surcharges on companies that rent cars from lots outside the airport property. Here is a list of the larger airports imposing the charge, and the percentage they add to the rental bill.

HEADLINE: What the 70 Days Cost

 BODY:
In the way he said no yesterday, Mario Cuomo showed America the complexity that New Yorkers long ago discovered in their Governor: He is eloquent, and exasperating. His political behavior can be masterful, if occasionally also martyred. He brims with sophistication, but sometimes only with sophistry.
He will not run for President -- he cannot run, he said -- because the State Senate Republicans are viciously obstructing critical budget negotiations. Yet almost in the next breath, he couldn't resist displaying how well he, the voice of "the big steelworkers with the thick fingers who can't handle computers," might have flayed George Bush. 
 It took some time before he finally seemed to say that after 70 days of highly publicized cogitation, he had decided definitively not to challenge the six announced Democratic candidates.
What have these 10 weeks cost? In the end, once the other candidates make up for lost time fund-raising, they probably will not have lost much. The protracted pondering has made people exasperated with him, not them. But by now putting his Presidential aspirations on the scale in the "wrestling negotiations" over the budget, Mr. Cuomo may yet accomplish something constructive.
The delay in deciding, down to the last 90 minutes before the New Hampshire filing deadline, did nothing to enhance his reputation. He has replaced Dan Quayle as the target of television talk-show hosts. The public did see Mr. Cuomo's rare intelligence. None of the Democratic candidates are yet his equal at filleting George Bush's record. Yet he offered precious little substance. This time in the sun gave Mr. Cuomo his chance to contribute to the national dialogue and he made little of it.
It was probably inevitable that his dalliance with Presidential politics would hurt at home, where Republicans control the Senate. Efforts to close New York's huge budget gap were never destined to go smoothly; legislators always resist budget cuts, especially nearing an election year. But the Governor's larger ambitions gave Republicans little incentive to resolve the crisis, as he must have anticipated from the beginning.
Now, by giving up those ambitions, Mr. Cuomo forces the Republicans to deal with the gripping problems. New York faces a budget gap approaching $4 billion, the largest anticipated deficit in memory. And the economy shows no signs of improving. It's a task of daunting difficulty, closing the budget gap while saving vital services.
The Governor says he retreated from the Presidential campaign because a "threat hangs over the heads of New Yorkers that I have sworn to put first." Perhaps his political sacrifice, perceived or real, will shake up legislators and force them to confront their own responsibility.

HEADLINE: Wrong Symbolism on Mayoral Pay

 BODY:
From the beginning, Mayor David Dinkins's voluntary 5 percent pay cut was more important for its symbolism than its impact on New York City's budget. It didn't save a lot of money, but by taking that small cut in his own salary and those of about 800 managers, the Mayor was saying that he understood the impact of the recession and was willing to do his bit. That's what mayors are supposed to do -- set a tone.
That is why Mr. Dinkins's latest decision -- to rescind the cuts -- is so disappointing. In a city where more than 138,000 jobs have disappeared in the last year, including 6,000 in city government, people need a sense that their most prominent political leader cares about their plight. 
 The Mayor reversed himself because the cut would reduce city pensions, which are based on earnings. The Mayor said that would not be fair. His Corporation Counsel, Peter Sherwood, says the salary reduction also hurts morale among staff members. But even if a case can be made that senior staff should now get their full salaries, there is no good reason for the Mayor to restore his own.
Borough President Ruth Messinger of Manhattan, her Bronx counterpart, Fernando Ferrer, and City Council President Andrew Stein all continue to accept 5 percent reductions in their salaries. The City Comptroller, Elizabeth Holtzman, took the 5 percent cut, then reduced that to 2 percent.
The Mayor could even accept his full salary and, like Council Speaker Peter Vallone, return 5 percent to the treasury. That keeps pension rights intact but sends a signal of modest sacrifice. For a struggling city, that show of empathy means a lot.

Behind Mel Miller's Downfall

BYLINE: By DOROTHY J. SAMUELS

 BODY:
Mel Miller's days as one of the most powerful politicians in New York State are over. His conviction last week on Federal fraud charges meant automatic expulsion from the State Assembly, and a new Assembly Speaker, Saul Weprin, now serves in his place.
But questions linger about the case, prompted by the high political stakes and the relatively minor nature of the charges on which Mr. Miller was ultimately convicted. Was this a reasonable prosecution for the United States Attorney in Brooklyn, Andrew Maloney, a Republican, to bring against the Assembly's top Democrat, or was it overreaching? 
 The case history suggests no dark partisan motive. Mr. Maloney's office apparently stumbled upon the shady real estate transactions that gave rise to the prosecution during the course of another investigation. Mr. Miller is right that an ordinary citizen probably would not have been indicted on the same set of facts. But that by itself doesn't prove prosecutorial abuse.
A U.S. Attorney must always be selective in choosing which acts of wrongdoing to pursue, and high-profile cases can have a real deterrent value. In general, the public probably has more to fear from prosecutorial timidity, when evidence leads to a high public official, than from the reverse.
Nevertheless, it's disquieting that a top leader of state government has been toppled, and may serve prison time, for acts that, while surely unethical, seem grist more for a bar association disciplinary proceeding or civil lawsuit than prosecution.
The indictment charged that he and his law partner and Assembly counsel, Jay Adolf, cheated law clients out of $300,000 in profits they might have made from investments in cooperative apartments. The jury acquitted Mr. Miller on the two more troubling charges -- that he profited by mailing forged documents and by fraudulently gaining control of an elderly woman's apartment. But another charge stuck: Mr. Miller was convicted of breaching his fiduciary duty as a lawyer by cutting himself in on a lucrative deal to buy apartments in a Brooklyn building without telling his clients.
It's true that lawyers owe their clients a duty of undivided loyalty. It's also true that the sleazy dealings confirmed by the trial cast substantial doubt on Mr. Miller's fitness to continue in high office even if the jury's verdict had acquitted on all charges. Indeed, many admirers of Mr. Miller's work in Albany say they are amazed by his arrogance in assuming he could get away with playing so fast and loose with ethics.
By secretly buying apartments for himself, Mr. Miller was found to have cheated his clients of an economic opportunity. The person identified by prosecutors as the principal fraud victim testified he would hire Mr. Miller again, fueling suspicion the case would not have been pursued but for Mr. Miller's stature. But that doesn't decide the fraud issue. There were other investors who didn't testify, and an unhappy victim isn't a necessary element of the crime.
Whether Mr. Miller's chiseling rises to a theft of "property" under the Federal mail fraud statute is a close legal question. It will be a centerpiece of Mr. Miller's appeal. The law may well be sufficiently elastic to cover Mr. Miller's tawdry transactions. But it would stretch fairness to impose a prison term when the usual penalty, according to experts in legal ethics, is disbarment.

HEADLINE: U.S. Government to Pay for New York Thruway, 35 Years Late

BYLINE: By LINDSEY GRUSON, Special to The New York Times

 BODY:
WASHINGTON, Dec. 20 --
When Daniel P. Moynihan, then a professor at Syracuse University, went to the 1960 Democratic Convention, he fought for a plank in the party platform calling for the Federal Government to repay New York for building the New York State Thruway. It was one of the few commitments John F. Kennedy's campaign managers declined to include in an almost bottomless grab bag of promises.
But this week Mr. Moynihan received the $5 billion commitment. Culminating a 30-year battle by the Senator, President Bush in Dallas signed a $151 billion transportation bill that includes authorization to pay New York $338 million a year for 15 years for having built the 570-mile highway, now the Gov. Thomas E. Dewey Thruway, and contributing it to the interstate highway system. The money can be used for any transportation-related purpose. 
 The bill provides similar payments for roads in all other states. New Jersey will receive $2 billion and Connecticut $1.7 billion.
The Thruway decision is a testament to one politician's perseverance and to the powers of seniority in Congress.
But Senator Moynihan, a New York Democrat, says the decision also stands as an exclamation mark to a philosophical shift in the way New York and the surrounding states relate to the Federal Government.
Since Franklin D. Roosevelt assembled his Democratic coalition 60 years ago, New York legislators and others from the Northeast often approached the Federal budget as a tool for social engineering, writing bills to send money around the country in an effort to change customs and habits.
 
Getting and Spending
 As a result, Mr. Moynihan says, the region has received less back for the money it sends to Washington than any other area in the country. In its most recent annual survey of Federal spending and taxing, the Senator's office found that New Yorkers last year paid an average of $1,178 more in taxes for each person than they received in Federal outlays. Connecticut residents had a $2,011 deficit, and New Jerseyans fared worse, suffering a per-capita deficit of $2,487. New Mexico residents, by contrast, received $2,776 more a person than they sent to Washington.
In recent years, however, long-simmering anger over the imbalance has risen to a political fever pitch.
Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, a Republican from Long Island, has sustained his career by ceaselessly billing himself as an advocate of parochial concerns. Senator Bill Bradley, the New Jersey Democrat, was nearly defeated in the 1990 election in good part because of a feeling that he neglected constituent service for national issues. And Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, accused by opponents of failing to focus on his economically hard-pressed state, is facing an unexpectedly difficult re-election campaign.
Mr. Moynihan, chairman of the Water Resources, Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, has long argued that the interstate system was a paradigm of the Northeast's approach to the Federal budget.
 
An 'Astounding' Oversight
 The 1956 legislation establishing the interstate system was in large part drafted and guided through Congress by lawmakers from New York. But in what Mr. Moynihan calls an "astounding" oversight, they did not include provisions to repay New York for building the Thruway, whose first section linking Rochester and Lowell had opened two years previously.
In recognition that some states had already spent lavishly out of their own pockets, the legislation did call for a study to document the value of any state roads contributed to the interstate system -- an implicit promise to repay those states. But the study was never performed, and the money never repaid.
Mr. Moynihan failed in numerous efforts to get the money. This year he included a provision for the study in his transportation bill, the first comprehensive rewrite of the country's transportation policies in 35 years. Since it only called for a report, the provision did not attract much attention.
"I decided I might as well go for broke," Senator Moynihan said. He proposed authorizing a 15-year repayment schedule for state road contributions, with the payout to begin in 1996. With the political powerhouses of California and Texas also in line to be major beneficiaries -- California getting $10.1 billion and Texas $6.8 billion -- a critical mass of support was reached.
In the rush to adjourn before Thanksgiving, the proposal was passed by Congress without debate.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 27, 1991, Friday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about Senator Daniel P. Moynihan's efforts to have the Federal Government repay New York State for rebuilding the Thruway misstated the amount of repayments authorized by Congress last month for two other states. California will get $1.6 billion and Texas $1.1 billion.

HEADLINE: Previews, That Broadway Malady

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
You know a broadway musical has become a citywide joke when an 8-year-old boy is dishing it in the men's room at intermission. At the performance I attended of "Nick and Nora" -- one of the designated press performances near the end of the much-delayed production's ninth week of previews -- I overheard this exchange between a father and his young son:
Father: "They made a mistake being so similar to 'City of Angels.' " 
 Son: "But 'City of Angels' was different. It wanted to be funny."
Father: "Yeah, and this one, well, it wants to be . . . "
Son (sarcastically): "Dad, I think they're going for sophistication."
That "Nick and Nora" failed to find sophistication, or laughs, or anything else that might amuse an audience for an evening, is old news now. A week after the critics came, the show closed, and its contents, which were guilty of no sin graver than mediocrity, have probably already been forgotten by most everyone who sampled them. What cannot be so easily forgotten, however, is the circus that preceded the opening of "Nick and Nora." While the show itself was just an innocuous, if professional, flop, its noisy preview period was a true amateur night, a public relations catastrophe for a Broadway theater industry that surely does not need to trumpet further its artistic disarray and indifference to the consumer.
During its 71 previews at a $60 top ticket price, "Nick and Nora" was seen by roughly 90,000 people. Most of them, one can assume, were a captive audience, in that they had purchased their nonrefundable tickets in good faith in advance, sometimes at the premium charged by worthy organizations holding theater parties. This audience turned on the show with a vengeance, as became apparent once the advance sale was depleted and word-of-mouth could catch up with the box office.
After six weeks of crowded previews, attendance at "Nick and Nora" began a free fall, according to the figures reported in Variety. The public had thus rendered its verdict well before the critics arrived -- a producer's dream that turns into a nightmare when the show is poor -- and, given the ferocity of that opinion, it is unlikely that even favorable reviews could have saved "Nick and Nora" by that juncture. When the negative reviews finally did arrive, they were merely autopsies confirming the corpse's death by natural causes.
Along its not-so-merry way to oblivion, "Nick and Nora" grew into something bigger than just another Broadway flop: its title became a rallying cry for audiences who have long been infuriated by Broadway's disregard for the rights of ticket buyers. "Forbidden Broadway" wasted no time in satirizing "Nick and Snora" while it was still being revised, calling its full-price previews "a rip-off." Disgruntled preview patrons took to writing journalists with their complaints, demanding that critics review the musical immediately, ready or not, and the outcry spread so far that, at one point, I picked up the phone to find a radio interviewer from Cardiff, Wales, on the line inquiring into the delayed opening of "Nick and Nora."
As if this were not notoriety enough, the city's Consumer Affairs Commissioner, Mark Green, presumably prodded by columns such as those by Linda Winer in Newsday and Greg Evans in Variety, got into the act, demanding that productions like "Nick and Nora" label their previews clearly in advertising so that, in Mr. Green's words, consumers could be "put on notice when they are seeing a work-in-progress as opposed to a finished product." While "Nick and Nora" was far from the first Broadway musical to fudge the distinction between previews and post-opening performances in much of its advertising, it was nothing if not the wrong flop in the wrong place in the wrong time. It caught the public's eye not just because it was the most troubled original American musical of the Broadway season but because it was the only original American musical of a Broadway season mired in recession.
Mr. Green's efforts to regulate theatrical advertising were a partial success. He got Broadway and Off Broadway producers to agree to a compromise that will require previewing productions to indicate that fact in all newspaper advertising except the daily classified directory of shows. But the infamy "Nick and Nora" achieved during its unhappy life is less an issue of truth-in-advertising than competence-in-producing. At a time when the American musical has been steadily eroded by runaway production costs and ticket prices and a continuing talent drain, the spectacle created by "Nick and Nora" seems like the coup de grace.
It is not a figment of the audience's imagination that the preview process has spun out of control for Broadway musicals. The process is running amok -- and alienating what loyal audience Broadway has left -- and no one in the industry seems to care. In response to Mr. Green's complaints demanding the labeling of previews in advertising, Daniel Brambilla, an attorney for the League of American Theaters and Producers, the Broadway trade association, told a reporter for The New York Times: "The next thing they'll be doing is ask us to publish the bad reviews. It's absurd. There is nothing deceptive about this. It's been going on for decades."
Mr. Brambilla is wrong. It has not been going on for decades in the way it is now.
To see how much the preview system has deteriorated, and how much the paying audience is being exploited, one does not have to go back very far. The first musical to play extended previews on Broadway was "Wish You Were Here" in 1952. That show had to forsake the then-standard out-of-town previews -- tryouts in cities like New Haven and Philadelphia and Boston -- for the same reason many musicals do today. Its sets, which featured an on-stage swimming pool, were too unwieldy and costly to send on the road. "Wish You Were Here" limited its previews to three and a half weeks, all of them sold to charity benefits, with no preview tickets on sale at the box office (or advertised) to the general public. The show then opened to poor reviews on a hot June night when the air conditioning in the Imperial Theater broke down.
Leland Hayward, the producer, and Joshua Logan, the director, hated the preview experience of "Wish You Were Here" for reasons that would be echoed by many musical-theater hands who followed them. They vowed "never again to try out a show in New York," Variety reported. "Every revision of the book or music or even altered bits of staging became a hot Shubert Alley flash. . . . Some professionals made a minor career of attending preview performances, then rushing off to spread the latest tidings." Though "Wish You Were Here" gradually became a hit, its success was attributed to revisions made in a panic after the opening, rather than in previews, and to the popularity of Eddie Fisher's recording of the title song.
Only five months after the "Wish You Were Here" experiment, the tight preview principles it established were broken. "Two's Company," a much troubled revue starring Bette Davis, became the first show to insist that it should have two weeks of critic-free previews on Broadway in addition to its lengthy out-of-town tryout (in three cities, no less), so that further revisions could be made with a new director. (Among the show doctors who worked on "Two's Company" was Arthur Laurents, author and director of "Nick and Nora.")
But "Two's Company" never got to carry out this scheme; the previews were abruptly canceled when Davis took ill, or said she did. It was in early 1954, with the play "The Immoralist," that the producer Billy Rose first delayed a previously announced opening and held paid public previews for artistic reasons, begging critics to ignore the production's first week of performances while Daniel Mann took over the direction from Herman Shumlin. The New York Times (among others) sent a reporter to file an unofficial report on the first preview anyway, and he described the production as "often lifeless." Brooks Atkinson wrote a favorable review a week later, after the official opening, but the audience, in a pattern that would also be repeated in years to come, did not have faith in a play that had postponed its opening with such publicity. "The Immoralist" closed in three months.
Throughout the 1950's, previews remained the exception, not the rule, and no production dared approach the three-and-a-half-week preview period of "Wish You Were Here." But by the mid-1960's previews had proliferated -- for shows that had out-of-town tryouts and those that did not -- and it became standard practice for producers to offer compensation to the audience for attending them by reducing ticket prices. Harold Prince was the first producer to acknowledge that the old opening night was dead as an institution since it no longer was, in fact, a premiere. He went so far as to relieve the by-now artificial, not to mention inhumane, opening-night pressure on actors and critics by inviting the press to cover any of the last three previews (of 21) of "Cabaret," in 1966. (The practice is now standard.) With that show, he also allowed theatergoers to pay reduced preview prices for regular performances, if they were willing to gamble on the show's quality by purchasing tickets well in advance of opening night.
Previews were always clearly labeled in the 1960's as well as reduced in price. (For straight plays, back when Broadway still produced them on a regular basis, preview periods were also very short, since dramas cannot be doctored as musicals are and rarely attract the large advance sales needed to support extended previews.) But as producers gradually found out that they could get away with cutting corners, they did. In the 1970's, preview periods got longer -- a necessity as out-of-town tryouts became increasingly out of financial reach -- but fewer and fewer shows reduced the price of preview tickets, especially musicals whose tickets were in greatest advance demand and needed no added inducements to be sold to the public.
In the go-go 1980's came the next step: the blurring or end of labeling previews in advertising and in the signs around the box office, with odd locutions such as "performances begin" substituting for the former phrase "previews begin." Once full-price previews ceased even to be easily identifiable as such, public disgruntlement started to increase, finally to reach firestorm proportions with "Nick and Nora."
During the entire history of musical previews on Broadway, however, one principle has remained constant. With only scattered exceptions, hit musicals tend to have compact preview periods (a month or less) and open on the date originally announced. Flop musicals postpone their openings repeatedly and extend the preview period beyond a month -- usually to the very week, as it just happens, that the advance sale runs out. The musicals that have at various times set records for number of Broadway preview performances, or flirted with doing so until the critics stormed in, are hardly an honor roll. They include "Hot Spot," "Golden Rainbow," "Dear World," "Sarava," "Merlin" and "Legs Diamond." Most of them had stars -- from Judy Holliday to Angela Lansbury to Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorme -- who could guarantee an advance sale that would keep preview houses near capacity for about six weeks. After that point -- around the 50th preview -- bad word-of-mouth would almost always sap business, just as it did at "Nick and Nora." Then the "opening" would at last be held.
Were any of these bombs improved by previewing for as long as six, seven and eight weeks in New York? Not enough to make a difference. While there are many examples of promising musicals that have been fine-tuned, cut or even substantially improved (by the addition of a major number or two) during a month of Broadway previews, the musicals that take much longer than that tend to be out-and-out disasters waiting for a miracle that never arrives. No matter how long the preview period, after all, it is still impossible to rewrite, recast, restage and redesign an entire misbegotten Broadway production that has left the rehearsal studio and is playing eight exhausting performances a week. Even in the days of tryouts on the road, the list of musicals that were transformed from true catastrophes into swans is minuscule.
Was the press right to wait to review repeatedly delayed and patently commercial productions until tens of thousands of customers had wasted their time and money on them during extended Broadway previews? Probably not; at least an interim report might have been called for after the first month, particularly if the price scale and advertising implied to the public that these productions were completed, rather than works-in-progress.
Is there a solution to this conflict between the interests of producers eager to protect a huge investment, and those of audiences who have a right to know what they are buying when they invest $60 or more in a Broadway musical ticket? At the very least, the commercial theater's leaders, if such a breed exists, might address the problem frankly and engage the public in a dialogue about the situation instead of trying to see how much fudging they can get away with until the press or the government blows the whistle.
Or is it already too late to save the endangered Broadway musical and retain its audience? In a depressing coincidence, "Nick and Nora" held its delayed opening on the same weekend that the Nederlander Organization disclosed the sale of the Mark Hellinger Theater to the Times Square Church, ending that house's career as a legitimate theater as firmly as if it had been torn down. The Hellinger is inextricably linked in theatrical legend to its most famous tenant, "My Fair Lady," the great American musical of the Broadway theater's last golden age; its loss is a symbolic blow to Broadway tantamount to the demolition of the Morosco Theater, the original home of the archetypal great American play, "Death of a Salesman," a decade ago.
Following five weeks of out-of-town tryouts in 1956, "My Fair Lady" opened at the Hellinger after one charity preview performance. It ran almost seven years. Some of the Hellinger's tenants in the subsequent three decades have included "Dear World" (49 previews, 132 post-opening performances), "Merlin" (69 previews, 199 performances) and, its last theatrical attraction, "Legs Diamond" (72 previews, 64 performances).
As with "Nick and Nora" (71 previews, 9 performances), the bloated preview periods of these shows accomplished little beyond the antagonizing of Broadway's once-loyal advance-ticket buyers. After being badgered repeatedly by musicals that are not ready to open, is it any wonder that this audience is no longer large enough to prevent theaters like the Hellinger from being closed?

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living in: The Flatiron District

 BODY:
BETWEEN the Civil War and World War I, the elegant stores, restaurants and hotels that multiplied between 14th and 23d Streets, from Broadway to Sixth Avenue, made the area the city's most glamorous shopping district.
On and near Broadway between 15th and 23d Street were, among others, Lord & Taylor and Gorham silversmiths. Sixth Avenue (now Avenue of the Americas) was home to B. Altman, the Hugh O'Neill Store and -- the biggest, grandest of them all -- the huge Siegel-Cooper department store in an ornate six-story building. 
 Today the area enjoys a new vitality, fueled by a migration of chic clothiers, restaurants and nightspots. By 1989, said Marilyn Young, a broker with the Ambrose Mari-Elia realty agency, the area had become "as hot as a pistol" for residential sales.
Most New Yorkers call the neighborhood the Flatiron District, a name taken from the wedge-shaped Flatiron Building on 23d Street where Fifth Avenue and Broadway cross. The 21-story building, designed by Daniel H. Burnham & Company of Chicago and completed in 1902, was among the first in the city to have a steel skeleton.
After World War I, as shopping -- and shoppers -- moved uptown, the Flatiron District became little more than a dreary, sparsely populated place that people passed through on their way to such desirable destinations as Gramercy Park, Chelsea and Greenwich Village. Its cavernous loft spaces housed warehouses, light manufacturers, artists and photographers.
Not until the early 1980's did some conversion to office use start, with advertising agencies and publishing houses leading the influx. Other businesses, lured by relatively low rents and large spaces, soon followed, and by the mid 80's residential conversion had begun.
In the last five years the district's commercial activity has become somewhat like the fast-paced growth of SoHo several years earlier. Retailers on Fifth Avenue include Armani, Joan and David, Kenneth Cole and the Gap; on Broadway, Preferred Seating, Paragon, ABC Carpet and The Wiz. Among the restaurants are Prix Fixe, the Union Square Cafe and Metropolis Cafes, Cal's, Mesa Grill, America and Lola, and -- for lunch and afternoon tea -- the Book-Friends Cafe on West 18th Street.
"It's as though these beautiful old Romanesque buildings are finding new lives," said Laurie Beckelman, chairwoman of the Landmarks Preservation Commission. "And the best part is that the restorations being undertaken, like the Giorgio Armani store, for example, preserve the spirit of the area's history."
The Armani restoration, at 110 Fifth Avenue, at 16th Street, was completed in 1989, and Emporio Armani opened on March 14 that year. Two months later the Landmarks Preservation Commission created the Ladies' Mile Historic District, which runs roughly from West 24th to West 14th Street and from west of Avenue of the Americas to just east of Broadway.
Along the Avenue of the Americas there is some occupied office space, but several parcels, like the 750,000-square-foot former Siegel-Cooper store, are vacant or nearly vacant.
"Just as expansion was starting to go westward," said William L. Haines, president of the Lower Fifth Avenue Association, "Sixth Avenue and its resurgence coincided with the recession."
DESPITE the relative newness of the area as a residential center, bargains are rare. Except for a few buildings along 23d Street between Fifth Avenue and Avenue of the Americas, apartment prices are generally no lower than in more established neighborhoods. Still, those looking for airy loft spaces with the convenience of being close to midtown and Wall Street find the district attractive.
Buyers can expect to spend about $400,000 for a 1,300-square-foot loft, said Pamela Leibman of the Corcoran Group, and renting a similar sized one-bedroom loft will run about $2,000 a month, said Alan Chaprack of Quality Living Realtors, rental agents.
Few loft buildings offer doorman or concierge services.
Most of the modern apartment buildings in the area are condominiums. Ms. Young of Ambrose Mar-Elia said one-bedroom condominiums are in the $225,000 range. Rents in the modern buildings range from $1,000 to $1,250 for a studio and $1,350 to $2,300 for a one-bedroom.
Not unlike the rest of the New York City, the languid real estate climate has meant slow-moving sales in the Flatiron District. Ms. Young said she listed a 2,400-square-foot loft with an asking price of $750,000 this summer, and interest has been light.
On Dec. 8, 35 units at Grosvenor House, a new condominium at 22 West 15th Street, were auctioned and 29 were sold. Of the 134 units in the building, where sales opened in 1989, 38 remain unsold.
Bruce Bobrow, a 47-year-old clothing manufacturer who moved to the Grosvenor House in 1989 with his wife, Julie, 35, a retailer, said they "love the excitement" of the neighborhood.
"It's like living in Paris -- the architecture, the shopping," he said. "We do lots of shopping up and down Fifth Avenue."
Some longtime residents of the area say gentrification is not without costs and are bitter about development. They say the newfound interest in Ladies' Mile (as the purists prefer to call their neighborhood) is more of a slick selling tool for the real estate industry than an indication of substantial community improvement.
Dr. Jay Kuhlman, a veterinarian who has practiced at 37 East 19th Street for 22 years, said only half-jokingly: "Used to be, there was nowhere in this neighborhood to eat. Now there'e nowhere in the neighborhood I can afford to eat. I guess you could say it's a mixed blessing."
Nevertheless, many residents say the increased traffic in the Flatiron District makes them feel safer. A spokesman from the 13th Police Precinct -- which takes in 14th to 30th Street, from Seventh Avenue to the East River -- said that no statistics were kept on individual neighborhoods but that reported crimes have decreased precinctwide.
But Joan Ramer, district manager for Community Board 5, disagrees. "Before, with fewer people around here, robbers were less apt to hang around," she said. "Why would they want to stake out an area with such slim prospects?"
There are no public schools in the area. Most children attend either P.S. 40 in the Gramercy Park area or P.S. 41 in Greenwich Village. St. Francis Xavier High School, a Roman Catholic school for boys, is on West 16th Street.
THE proliferation of hot nightspots draws thousands of people to the district almost nightly, giving those who live there their biggest headache. But, since the neighborhood is zoned for commercial rather than residential use, that problem is not likely to be alleviated anytime soon.
On West 20th Street between Fifth Avenue and Avenue of the Americas, for example, are four clubs and an aerobic dance studio that, their neighbors say, send thudding bass vibrations through their apartments day and night. They are further annoyed by crowds of young revelers -- often drunk -- on the streets from 10 P.M. till the early morning hours.
"My advice is: If you're thinking of living here -- don't," says Richard Goldman, a photographer whose home/studio is at 36 West 20th Street. "Ever since the Limelight came here nine years ago, other clubs have followed. And we have witnessed nothing less than the rape of a neighborhood."
The Limelight, at the northeast corner of Avenue of the Americas and 20th Street, is a disco in a converted church.
To be sure, living in a "hot" neighborhood like the Flatiron poses problems. Still, for some the noise and congestion are not a bad trade-off for such amenities as neighborhood cafes and the greenmarket at Union Square Park. And while some of the newer tenants may be chic and trendy, there are veterans of the area who have shared in the area's prosperity.
The Old Town Bar and Restaurant, a neighborhood fixture for more than a century on 18th Street between Broadway and Park Avenue South, was virtually unknown five years ago. But its manager, John Sisson, says the casual watering hole and eating place has experienced a tenfold increase in business since 1985.
"It's definitely more 'yuppified' than it used to be," said Mr. Sisson. "But there's no attitude; they're not so bad. In here, everybody mixes together."

It convinced city officials that the Flatiron District was an up-and-coming area and the city changed its plan, repaving as far south as 12th Street.

HEADLINE: Chilly Days Bring Cold Comfort on Slopes

BYLINE: By JACK CAVANAUGH

 BODY:
WHEN up to four inches of snow fell on most of the state on a recent Friday, hundreds of skiers turned out at Connecticut ski areas the next day, eager to take advantage of the first snowfall of the season. The snow was just frosting on the cake, though, since all five ski areas already had good bases of man-madesnow.
"But the snowfall made skiers think skiing," said Dave Harlow, the general manager at the Powder Ridge ski area in Middlefield, near Middletown. He was referring to what ski operators refer to as "the snow in the backyard syndrome": most skiers, and particularly novices, are only inclined to go skiing if they see snow on their own lawns. 
 The ski operators' time of plenty was quickly over. By Monday unseasonably mild weather and heavy rain had melted practically all the snow in backyards and on ski slopes. Continuing rain and high temperatures forced all five ski areas to remain closed last weekend and left the ski operators wondering whether they were to endure another abysmal ski season.
By early last past week, though, a cold front had moved across the state, enabling snow-making machines to blanket many trails with man-made (ski operators abhor the term "artificial") snow. A light snowfall across the state on Tuesday got people thinking about snow again, and by Wednesday all the ski areas in the state had reopened for business. All that bode well for the week between Christmas and New Year's, which is traditionally the busiest ski week of the year. Last year, although about six inches of snow fell across most of the state on Dec. 28, rain, fog and mild weather made ski conditions poor during most of Christmas week.
Two mild winters in a row have hurt all the state's ski areas, as well as those to the north. Even more injurious have been the effects of the current recession, which has led to the demise of two long-established Vermont ski resorts, Magic Mountain and Ascutney. Most ski industry analysts say that the recession, particularly if it is coupled with another unseasonably warm winter, could severely damage other ski resorts in the region.
But some Connecticut ski operators say the recession may benefit them. "Skiers are still going to go skiing, but they're going to be watching their money more closely than ever," Mr. Harlow said. "They're not going to be as inclined to go north and spend an arm and leg on a condo to go skiing." Other ski operators in the state agreed that they could benefit, to a degree, from the tight economy.
"I think we're more recession-proof, since practically all of our skiers are day trippers," said the president and general manager at Mohawk Mountain in Cornwall, Carol Lugar. "People are going to stay closer to home, and that could help us."
While some ski resorts in Vermont now charge more than $40 a day for a lift ticket, prices at Connecticut ski areas have remained about the same as last year, $30 a day or less. Four of the five ski operators have not passed onto their customers the cost of the expanded state sales tax. "We're absorbing the $1.08 sales tax on each ticket," Mr. Harlow said. "Which means the ticket, before taxes, is $25.92. By comparison, last year it was $26."
Lift-ticket prices on weekends this winter will range from $30 at Mohawk, the state's largest ski area, to $20 at the Woodbury ski area, the smallest. Weekend prices at Powder Ridge and Ski Sundown in New Hartford are $27, while at Mount Southington near Waterbury they are $26.
"We've actually lowered some of our prices," said Rick Carter, the general manager at Ski Sundown, about 15 miles northwest of Hartford. "For example, our beginner's package, which includes a lift ticket, equipment and a group lesson, is now $25, $3 less than last year."
As it was at most Connecticut ski areas, business was down at Ski Sundown last season. "The weather was generally lousy, and after a while people got discouraged," Mr. Carter said. "We were open 90 days, which is about average for us. But business was off by about 20 per cent.
Other ski operators said the economic climate also hurt business last season. "It was a very tough year," said the general manager at Mount Southington, Ed Beckley. "There was the bad weather, the economy and the Persian Gulf war. People didn't want to go out and have a good time skiing while the war was going on."
 
'Very Heartening'
 Mr. Harlow said he was surprised when about 1,000 skiers turned out at Powder Ridge after the season's first snowfall.
"It was very heartening, to say the least," he said. "We get as many as 2,500 people on weekends during the middle of winter. But usually we have only several hundred during our first weekend."
Another good sign, Mr. Harlow added, was that group sales for the winter season are up from last year at Powder Ridge. The ski area, which has 14 trails, is also continuing its policy, initiated last year, of allowing skiers to exchange lift tickets for a later date if they are dissatisfied with the conditions, as long as the exchange is made within an hour after the ticket is purchased.
While skiing was not good last December, conditions improved markedly in January and February. But the absence of snow throughout the state once again had a negative psychological impact on the state's ski areas, which rely on man-made snow far more than the ski behemoths to the north.
"We were open 100 days, which is about average, and we had great skiing," Mr. Harlow said. "But we didn't have many customers."
In an effort to attract more customers, Mohawk Mountain has just installed lights for night skiing. Until last week it was the only ski area in the state that operated only in the daytime.
 
'More Socially Conscious'
 Mrs. Lugar said her father, Walter Schoenknecht, who opened Mohawk Mountain in 1947 and is credited with inventing man-made snow a few years later, often talked about putting in lights, before he died in 1987. "But he decided against it, because it seemed to go hand in hand with alcohol and a party atmosphere, and we're a family oriented ski area."
These days, however, "people are more socially conscious," Mrs. Lugar said. "So we don't think there'll be any problem. And there's a big segment of skiers out there that wants to ski at night, particularly people who don't have time to ski during the day."
Mrs. Lugar is hopeful that the profits from night skiing can help pay off some of the bills remaining from a tornado two and a half years ago that tore down several hundred trees at Mohawk and damaged some buildings, she said. "Our insurance only covered one-third of the costs from the tornado," she said. "And so we were left in a financial hole. So we had to expand our skiing base."
With 23 trails and a vertical drop of 660 feet, Mohawk, 28 miles north of Danbury, is Connecticut's biggest ski area, followed by Ski Sundown, which has 16 trails and a 625-foot drop.
So far this year the state's smallest ski area area, Woodbury, which has a vertical drop of only 300 feet, has been open the most. While the four larger ski areas remained closed over Thanksgiving weekend because of unseasonably warm weather, Woodbury opened the day before the holiday and remained open all weekend and through most of the following week.
"We've expanded our snow making, and we probably have more snow-making equipment than any other small ski area," said Rod Taylor, the owner and manager of Woodbury, which is also well known for the reggae concerts held there during the summer. "That's why we were able to open so early. We're hopeful of recouping from last season, when we lost a lot of money, mainly because we couldn't make enough snow for cross-country skiing, which is a big part of our business."
So, too, is snowboarding, a fast-growing sport, in which people slide down trials on what look like oversize surfboards. About half of Woodbury's customers are now snowboarders.
 
'Nine Days Last Season'
 Perhaps the worst hit have been the state's five other cross-country ski-touring centers, which are totally dependent on natural snow.
"We were only able to open nine days last season, and, unfortunately, only two of those days were on weekends," said Heidi Martin, the executive director of the Winding Trails Cross-Country Ski Center in Farmington, near Hartford, which has 12 miles of trails. "We need a snowstorm of at least eight inches before we can operate, and that hasn't happened very often in recent years."
At that, Winding Trails has fared better than some cross-country ski centers in the state that have not been able to open a single day since the last winter with appreciable snow, in 1988.
"When there's no snow, we have to rely on hikers," Mrs. Martin said. "And now we're thinking of opening the trails to mountain bikers."

HEADLINE: Two-Families

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your Talking column on Dec. 8 on the application of the New York City housing antidiscrimination regulations to two-family houses was more than a little dismissive of the reasons such dwellings with an owner-occupant present have been exempt heretofore. 
 Yes indeed, for many resident owners of two-family houses, renting the other apartment is in fact very much like bringing a guest into one's home, to a degree that people who live in apartment houses cannot conceive. If the host cannot select a guest who will be compatible, the consequences can be terrible, for there are no supers or managing agents or co-op boards to intercede in the ensuing disputes, which have the unhappy property of being disputes between neighbors and also ones between landlord and tenant.
Nearly everyone who buys a two-family house has done so till now in the knowledge that we may choose our neighbor-tenant-guest. No doubt racial and other objectionable criteria for choice have been used by two-family house owners.
But often, the criterion used, which now will provide a pretext for a complaint to the authorities, has been entirely sensible -- selecting people who seem likely to be easy to get on with, rather than a new tenant who seems hostile or adversarial from the outset, for example, by bickering about minor provisions of the lease. From now on, an applicant who has been rejected for that reason can depict himself or herself as having been rejected for a prohibited reason.
If the new regulations produce a large volume of complaints and penalties, some owners, perhaps many of them, will withdraw their units from the rental market. That would be too bad, because the 100,000-plus units are an important part of the city's reasonably priced housing stock. Once again, the housing ideologues will have had it their way: more regulation at the price of less and worse housing.

KWANZAA IN YONKERS
The African-American cultural festival of Kwanzaa created in 1966 by Dr. Maulana Karenga, a California professor, as a festival of African-American life, will be celebrated by the Yonkers Public Library Thursday through Dec. 31. 
 A symbolic candlelighting ceremony representing the principles of Kwanzaa will open the celebration at 7 P.M. Thursday at the Getty Square Branch, 7 Main Street. Dr. Eugenia Bains, who teaches in the black studies department of the City University of New York, will be the guest speaker.
In African-American homes where Kwanzaa is observed, candles are lighted for each of seven nights, symbolizing the seven principles of the festival: unity, self-determination, collective work and responsibility, cooperative economics, purpose, creativity and faith.
Those attending the opening are encouraged to wear African dress, and they will be invited to sign a wall of names, which will remain on display throughout the Kwanzaa period.
Among other events is an informal fashion show of African clothes to be held Saturday at 1 P.M. in the Grinton I. Will Branch at 1500 Central Park Avenue. And on Tuesday from 1 to 3 P.M. Adazake Lynn Beville will tell stories in the children's room of the Getty Square Branch. Special exhibitions in both libraries will contain background information about Kwanzaa.
Admission is free; the phone number for more information is 337-1500.
 
'FRIENDS OF THE DRAGON'
 Loquacious the Dragon is the leading character in an original family musical called "Friends of the Dragon, or No Smoking Please," to be performed today at 4 P.M. in the Schoolhouse Theater, Croton Falls.
Produced for a third year by Barnspace Productions, the show was written by Janna Goodspeed, with a score by Lew Zwick. Performers of many ages participate.
Loquacious and his reptilian sidekick, Anguilla, travel the road to Friendship, losing their way but finding themselves in the process. On the journey, the two fire-breathers meet many strange and comedic characters that children have enjoyed each Christmas. Tickets are $6.
Another family-oriented program at the Schoolhouse is a performance at 2 P.M. Friday of Amy Harlib's "One-Woman Chinese Kung Fu Story Theater." Ms. Harlib, wearing the dramatic costumes of ancient Chinese swordsmen, puts on an awesome display of double-edged sword techniques, martial arts, gymnastics and yoga, which she combines with Chinese opera and storytelling of traditional Chinese folk tales.
She developed her performance by drawing on her partly Asian ancestry and from the years she spent in Taiwan in the mid-1980's researching theatrical and martial arts. Admission will be $5. Call the box office at 277-8477 for tickets to both programs. The theater is on Owens Road off Route 22.
 
CHRISTMAS DAY HIKE
 Residents of the Croton area might be interested in taking a break from roasting turkeys and unwrapping presents to participate in a two-mile Christmas Day hike around Old Teller's Point at Croton Point Park.
Christoper Letts, a naturalist-educator with the Hudson River Foundation, will start the tour at 2 P.M., covering the tidal marsh and reef in Croton Bay, a brick one-room schoolhouse and the Underhill wine caverns. Mr. Letts will discuss the influential Teller and Underhill families and the significance of the Point during the Revolutionary War. And he will talk about the Kitchiwank Indians, who were the original occupants of the area, and what has happened to them since they signed a treaty with Dutch settlers in 1645.
The afternoon will end with a cup of hot cider served in front of a roaring fire at the Senasqua Lodge, where the sun can been seen setting behind the Tappan Zee Bridge. Participants will meet in the parking lot of Croton Point Park on Croton Avenue, rain or shine. There is no charge for the program.
 
'A JOURNEY TO AFRICA'
 A segment of the Community Holiday Festival held at Lincoln Center each year will be sponsored by the Westchester Council for the Arts and Con Edison. It features the Ishangi Dancers in "A Journey to Africa," and the program begins at 2 P.M. Saturday in Alice Tully Hall.
The West African dance troupe is led by Baba Ishangi of Ghana, performing in costumes and using 15 native musical instruments from various parts of Africa.
Ishangi serves as a narrator, explaining the religious and secular significance of the songs, movements, masquerades and instruments. One dance performed on stilts is called the Dance of the High Spirits.
Generally, the message of this melange of African cultures is one of the sacredness of the earth, the reverence for family life, respect for elders and the belief that ancestors are part of one's extended family.
Tickets are free and can be obtained by calling 925-6075 or 428-4220.
 
A 'BEANSTALK' MUSICAL
 One of the Traveling Playhouse's most beloved productions is its one-hour musical based on "Jack and the Beanstalk," to be performed Saturday at 1 P.M. in the Yorktown Performing Arts Theater at 1974 Commerce Street in Yorktown Heights. Kay and Ken Rockefeller, directors of the White Plains troupe, constantly revise and update the production, which may account for its continued popularity.
The story line hews closely to the original tale of poor Jack, who trades his mother's cow for a handful of seemingly worthless beans, then climbs the vine that grows from one of the beans into a sky-high world of castles, ogres and hens that lay golden eggs. New songs were written by Richard Kinter, George Corrin designed the sets and Harriet Leigh the costumes. All tickets are $7 and can be reserved by calling 962-6665.
 
LOW-KICK WASSAIL BOWL
 Early American wassail bowls contained a mixture of mulled -- or warmed -- ale and wine, perked up with spices and sugar and garnished with roasted apples. The wassail drink of mulled cider to be served to visitors at George Washington's Headquarters Museum today from 3 to 6 P.M. may not have the same kick, but then the Colonials had horses that knew the way home, something that automakers have not yet devised.
Brandy mace cakes and other toothsome 18th-century sweets called jumbals, king cakes and rout drop cakes will be served around a hearth fire where the cider is kept warm. Recipes for the wassail and cakes will be available.
The museum, once the home of an 18th-century farmer and commandeered by General Washington as headquarters for the Battle of White Plains in 1776, is decorated with handmade folk art ornaments and lighted by candles.
The museum is on Virginia Road in North White Plains, reached by Route 22 or the Bronx River Parkway. Admission, refreshments and recipes are free. Call 949-1236 for more information.

HEADLINE: ALL ABOUT: MOTORCYCLES;
Selling Bikes After the Wild Ones Have Settled Down

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
IT'S fun to think of motorcycle history in terms of celebrity cachet. James Dean and Marlon Brando made motorcycles sexy and sinister. Malcolm Forbes associated them with well-heeled capitalists. Ronald Reagan visited a Harley-Davidson plant and presto, motorcycles symbolized America's renewed manufacturing competitiveness.
But behind the scenes, the motorcycle business is a lot less glitzy than the parade of flashy names might indicate. In fact, it is downright depressed. The recession, creeping couch potatoism and an explosion of consumer electronics products vying for the dwindling discretionary dollar have created a shrinking market for motorcycles. 
 According to the Motorcycle Industry Council, a trade group in Irvine, Calif., there are 7.3 million bikes on the road, down from 7.7 million in 1985. Don J. Brown, a motorcycle industry consultant also in Irvine, said sales of new street, dirt and sport bikes will reach $1.33 billion for 266,000 units this year, almost identical to last year, but a drop from the $1.9 billion in revenues and 680,000 bikes in the industry's peak year of 1984.
Dealers report that their only vibrant sellers are accessories -- like mugs with motorcycle logos, helmets and helmet decals.
Honda and the other Japanese companies have had the worst time of it, because the yen has made their products prohibitively expensive. But even America's Harley, which says it sells every bike it makes, is not sanguine. "A shrinking market is difficult for everyone," said Michael E. Keefe, Harley's director of marketing communications.
The council describes the typical rider as a 32.5-year-old man with household income of $39,200; a decade ago, he was about 27 and had household earnings of $17,800. "Far from being a rebel, the typical cyclist is the guy next-door," said Gary A. Christopher, the American Honda Motor Company's manager of motorcycle product evaluation.
The manufacturers are actively wooing that guy. Through the council, they have formed Discover Today's Motorcycling, a publicity campaign that positions motorcycling as safe, fun and something an educated, well-mannered person would do. American Honda's own $75 million campaign, "Come Ride With Us," has the same goal.
 
Competing With Japan
Harley's Problem Is Too Few Bikes
 For a while, it looked as though Harley-Davidson would get an easy ride.
Through much of the 1980's Honda, Kawasaki, Yamaha and Suzuki, the four Japanese manufacturers that dominated the American motorcycle market, focused primarily on high-performance sport bikes -- bikes that could go 175 miles an hour, that let their riders crouch forward in racer stance as they took corners at hairpin angles.
The problem, motorcycle experts say now, is that the Japanese were so busy innovating they forgot to hark to their market. "Every year would bring a different looking, faster bike," said Paul Dean, editorial director of Cycle World Magazine in Newport Beach, Calif. "That meant a steep depreciation rate, incredibly high costs for replacement parts and huge insurance premiums."
By the late 1980's the Japanese were erring at the other extreme. Recognizing that they were cannibalizing each other's sales as the market shrunk, they set out to woo new riders. They advertised in magazines like Life instead of biker books, they spurned new high-tech products in favor of non-racy bikes like Honda's Pacific Coast, a midsize touring bike that even has a luggage trunk.
"We were trying so hard to get the yuppies that our core group of cycle enthusiasts felt abandoned," said Honda's Mr. Christopher.
Against that backdrop, Harley cleaned up. It made big, clunky cruisers with lots of macho image but little glitz, whose basic design hadn't changed in years. A weak dollar helped it compete on price.
Mr. Brown said Harley had nearly 31 percent of the street-bike market in 1991; second-seller Honda had 26 percent. R. L. Polk & Company, a Detroit company known for its auto industry statistics, said that in 1985, Honda had nearly 47 percent of the street-bike market, with Harley at a paltry 9.4 percent.
But Harley's sales have been constrained by capacity. The company has a new paint facility and two new assembly lines about to open, but for now it cannot make more than about 70,000 bikes a year. And it exports about 40 percent of them.
The result is that Harley dealers remain on allocation. "I have six customers for every motorcycle I get," said Michael J. Lombardi, a Harley dealer in Staten Island.
The Japanese, meanwhile, are back in stride. They are offering new sport bikes to win back enthusiasts, and small off-road bikes that offer an unintimidating introduction to biking.
While they are unlikely to woo away the Schwarzenegger wannabes -- he rides a Harley -- industry experts think they have a good shot at riders who want a bike that is smaller than a Harley.
 
As Machines Age
Used Bikes Are Selling -- For Now
 Bikers aren't the only ones getting older. So are their machines.
According to the motorcycle council, the average motorcycle in 1985 was less than five years old; last year it was about 9.5. Dealers got more than 14 percent of their revenues from selling used bikes last year.
In Harley's case, one reason why the used market is thriving is that demand for new bikes outstrips supply. For the Japanese bikes, which are more plentiful, the reasons are rooted in the steeply rising prices. "People are saying, 'Let someone else take the depreciation,' and looking for good used bikes," said Mr. Dean of Cycle World..
The vibrant secondary market is unlikely to last much longer, though. As fewer new bikes are sold, the number of bikes coming into the used market must perforce dwindle. That means that the most popular used bikes will become harder to find, and concomittantly more expensive.
Mr. Brown, the consultant, predicts that sales of used motorcycle will drop as much as 25 percent in the next four years. "That means new bikes will soon sell well again," he said.
 
The Requisite Helmet
Sales Are Insured As States Pass Laws
 Bike manufacturers may be wimpering, but helmet makers are all smiles. The reason: Unlike bike sales, helmet sales have seen nary a blip. Though the council does not break out sales of helmets, sales of peripheral equipment reached $1.66 billion last year. There are eight million helmets in use.
"Our business has grown 20 percent a year, and there's no reason to think that will stop," said Patrick Donnelly, director of sales for the Shoei Safety Helmet Corporation, the Los Angeles company that is the largest helmet maker.
Helmet sales are bound to increase even further, as more states pass laws requiring riders to wear helmets. California, a major holdout, just passed such a law, effective Jan. 1. Most experts say a Federal law is inevitable.
New helmet technology also is spurring sales. Stores already are selling Italian helmets with a thermal control system that makes them cool in summer and warm in winter. And David A. Bottell, a California entrepreneur, is looking for a manufacturer to make the Protector, a new helmet designed by Lawrence A. Bernstein, the California inventor, that uses special side panels to enhance peripheral vision and hearing. "Those are the things riders complain about most," said Mr. Bottell.
Mr. Bottell is getting high-profile vocal support from Gary Busey, the 47-year-old actor who almost died in a cycle accident three years ago.
Scarcely two months after his accident, Mr. Busey was railing against mandatory helmet laws. His argument: Helmets took away too much hearing and peripheral vision. Now, he claims that motorcycle industry representatives took advantage of his post-accident emotional vulnerability to get him to castigate helmet laws. With almost religious zeal, he is holding press conferences, lobbying in Washington, and otherwise trying to insure that helmets are made mandatory throughout the country.
"There's a reason God let me come back alive," Mr. Busey said. "And that's to make sure that we don't see more kids with the life smashed out of their bodies because they aren't wearing helmets."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Economic Warfare, 1991 Style

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
IT IS NOT only the Soviet Union that evaporated in 1991. So too did the concept of economic cooperation among the leading Western economies.
That became clearer than ever last week, as the German central bank turned its back on the interests of most of Europe, let alone the United States, and jacked up interest rates.
The Bundesbank's surprisingly strong move left its discount rate at 8 percent, or more than double the 3.5 percent rate that this country's Federal Reserve adopted as it cut its rate by a point on Friday. 
 If nothing else, the Bundesbank's move showed that all the talk of international cooperation that emanated from the European summit at Maastricht was little more than empty words, a feeling that was reinforced by signs that the world's trade talks are unlikely to produce agreement. The Bundesbank is worried about rising inflation at home -- 4 percent is deemed too high -- and about requests from labor unions for 6 percent raises. It is also miffed that its good advice a couple of years ago, cautioning against the monetary unification of Germany on terms that grossly overvalued the East German currency, was ignored by the politicians.
It was quickly noted that the national leader most likely to suffer as a result of the Bundesbank's actions is John Major, the British Prime Minister who led the resistance to Germany's effort to unify Europe's economy under German domination. There have been signs that Britain was emerging from its recession and hopes that interest rates might drop. Now rates are unlikely to fall, and could rise, as Britain's election campaign begins.
But the German action will hurt not only those who opposed Germany in the European summit. France, a German ally, is likely to feel compelled to raise its interest rates soon, despite the shakiness of its economy. For both France and Britain, the alternative is likely to be a devaluation of their currencies against the mark.
Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman who only five months ago saw clear signs of recovery in this country's economy, now sees signs of stagnation, a situation that will be worsened as Germany's move dampens Europe's economies.
Mr. Greenspan is responding on several fronts. The decision to cut interest rates again got the most attention, but perhaps even more interesting was his attack on bank examiners, who he said are appraising real estate loan collateral "on a liquidation basis" when they should be giving the banks some slack. "I've always argued that it is the purpose of commercial banks to make illiquid loans," he told a Congressional hearing, adding that it was unfair to appraise property based on what it would get if sold today.
That kind of regulator bashing, coming from the chief regulator himself, may or may not encourage banks to make more loans. But it certainly reinforces the impression that Potomac panic is on the rise as the election nears.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
The Bundesbank's One-Two Punch

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
A BOXER in the ring knows that he is going to get punched. But sometimes he is surprised by the force of the blow. He will recoil, shake his head and wonder what has happened.
That is what occurred on Thursday when the German Bundesbank, which is becoming the rogue elephant of Europe, raised its two key interest rates -- the Lombard rate and the discount rate -- by half a percentage point each. 
 The Bundesbank move was not a surprise. An increase had generally been expected soon because the bank is intent on fighting domestic inflation regardless of the economic pain it causes its allies. But the size -- twice the expected increase of a quarter of a percentage point in the Lombard rate -- and the timing were a shock.
The Bundesbank's decision has an impact throughout Europe because of the dominance of Germany in the European Monetary System. Even though France, Britain and other European colleagues would like to slash interest rates to revive falling economies, the rules of the monetary system force them to follow German interest rates to keep their currencies within the system's set ranges. In this case, the French may have to raise their rates, and other countries may not be able to cut them, as they had hoped.
So there was a collective shaking of heads in Europe as analysts cleared their minds and studied the impact of the rate increase, which raised the Lombard rate to 9.75 percent and the discount rate to 8 percent.
First, it was not brotherly nor was it in line with the theme of European economic unity reaffirmed just two weeks ago. For markets, the rate increase seems to tip the scale in favor of bonds over stocks in Europe, analysts said. The rise in interest rates means slower economic growth and even lower company earnings. This makes stock investments look a little riskier than bonds.
The Federal Reserve Board's cut of the American discount rate to 3.5 percent from 4.5 percent on Friday will probably add to the upward pressure the Bundesbank has applied on European interest rates. The move strengthened the mark in the monetary system, forcing other European currency values closer to the point where interest rates may have to be raised.
The resulting rise in European currencies against the dollar could also hurt the sales of European exporting companies, like chemical and automobile manufacturers. And it will depress the earnings of European companies that have significant operations in the United States.
But looking to the middle or end of next year, the impact on investing decisions is a little harder to divine. The move by the Bundesbank may finally signal the top of the interest rate cycle in Europe, and so interest rates may finally begin to fall and thus give stocks a lift.
"I do not doubt that 1992 will be a good year for continental bond and equity markets," said Andrew Garthwaite, who does international asset allocation at S. G. Warburg Securities in London. "But the first quarter of next year will not be good and bonds will do better than equities."
Guy Rigden, director of strategy at UBS Phillips & Drew in London, was a little more shaken by the Bundesbank blow. The rate increase, he said, confirms his switch in the balance of his recommended portfolio back toward bonds. "I had bonds overweight three months ago and moved back into equities, and that was a very poor move," he said. "And you can quote me on that."
A key for stocks will be the timing of a fall in interest rates. But while analysts said this is the top for official German rates, they do not know when they will drop.
"It gets the top behind you, but it is incorrect to expect the Bundesbank can cut fairly soon," said Warren Oliver, an economist at UBS in London. He expects no reduction before May or June. And if the important German wage negotiations do not go well, he said, "it could be all year" before there is a cut.
Outside of stock and bond markets, the rate rise increases tension in the European Monetary System because of the pressure it puts on other members to keep interest rates high while their economies are sluggish or in recession. This pressure raises talk of realignment, which would mean currency devaluations and is unsettling to investors in markets like Britain and Italy.
And there is the political impact, which could also spill over into the stock market in Britain. The Bundesbank rate increase means that the Conservative Government of Prime Minister John Major has little room to lower interest rates before the 1992 election. High rates play into the hand of the rival Labor Party. Mr. Oliver of UBS said a interest rate cut the firm had penciled in for the first half of the year is now in doubt.
The timing of the Bundesbank's cut is also of interest. It appears the decision could have been made two weeks ago at the central bank's last meeting. But that meeting came just before the critical session in Maastricht, the Netherlands, on European monetary and political union. And the Bundesbank needed all the support it could get, especially from the most reluctant participant there, Prime Minister Major.

But there are those in California political circles who believe that Kathleen Brown could prove to be the family's real star.
Ms. Brown was elected California's Treasurer last year in her first run for statewide office. As Treasurer, she oversees the sale of state bonds and manages the state's investment portfolio. And she holds the job at a time when California faces its worst financial crisis in decades. 
 The state has been battered by unemployment in key industries like aerospace and construction, its tax revenues are falling short of expectations and its budget deficit is mounting. Standard & Poor's recently downgraded California's AAA bond rating a notch and Moody's Investors Services warned that it would take similar action if the state could not resolve its fiscal woes.
Ms. Brown, 46, compared S.& P. to "the Grinch that stole Christmas," arguing that California's economy remains fundamentally strong. She has also been promoting steps she said will help the state bounce back, including increased spending on roads, schools, water systems and other infrastructure.
While her lineage has given her considerable political visibility, it also carries with it some baggage, not the least of which is the inevitable comparison to her brother and what some people consider his lingering "Governor Moonbeam" image.
Ms. Brown, who graduated from Stanford University and earned a law degree at Fordham University, has always said she supports her brother, but has also subtly distanced herself from him, referring to herself during last year's campaign as "a different shade of Brown."

HEADLINE: Making a Difference;
Breaking Away, With a $2 Billion Piece of Carbide

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
BEFORE too long, H. William Lichtenberger will be busy playing the name game.
Until last week, Mr. Lichtenberger was president and chief operating officer of the Union Carbide Corporation. But then Carbide announced that it would be spinning off its industrial gases division in the next few months and that Mr. Lichtenberger would be the new company's first chairman and chief executive. The business will get its own shareholders -- and will soon need its own name. 
 "We are best known in this country as Linde," Mr. Lichtenberger said, referring to the brand name used by the division for its products in the United States. But since a German company owns the rights to that name outside the Western Hemisphere, it will not do for a global business.
About 50 percent of the sales of Union Carbide industrial gases are made outside the United States. In 1990, the division had sales of $2.38 billion, representing roughly one-third of the parent company's total.
The spinoff is the centerpiece of a Carbide plan, which also includes selling $500 million in other assets, to reduce the parent company's debt and increase its attraction to investors. Without the gases division, Carbide sales will be concentrated in basic chemicals and plastics.
Whether this is the most propitious time for the gas division to go it alone is far from certain, of course. Mr. Lichtenberger said sales of industrial gases, like oxygen, nitrogen and helium, largely track the overall health of the American and worldwide economies. "Gases are used by people who make things, from integrated steel mills to the corner auto body shop," he said. "So when people are not making as many things, there is a problem."
Yet environmental concerns both in this country and abroad are providing some opportunities for sales growth, even in a sluggish economy, he added.
"Just about any process that requires heat runs cleaner when you add oxygen to it," he said. And the cryogenic techniques used to liquefy air are applicable to capturing unwanted volatile organic compounds before they are released.
Mr. Lichtenberger, who is 56 years old, has an extensive background in the gas business. After earning both a liberal arts degree and a B.S. in chemical engineering from the University of Iowa, he joined the gas division at Carbide in 1959. Since then, he has held assignments in research, engineering, operations, sales and marketing. He also had overseas assignments, including serving as vice president for the industrial gas business for Union Carbide Europe from 1978 to 1980. He left the gas sector in 1985, when he was appointed president of the company's solvents and coating materials division.
Although he will be independent, Mr. Lichtenberger will not be far from his former colleagues at Carbide. The company sold its headquarters building in Danbury, Conn., in the mid-1980's and then leased it back for 20 years.
"We will have part of that rental obligation in the new company," he said. "I can't see that changing in the near term."

HEADLINE: Are Interest-Rate Cuts Any MAtch for This Recession

 BODY:
For economists, these are puzzling times. The recession was supposed to be short and shallow, but it has lasted 17 months -- 11 months is the average. And the tumble was no less deep than in other recessions. The recovery,  supposed to be vigorous,  has stalled. Last week the White House acknowledged something was amiss: "The economy is going very slow," said Marlin Fitzwater, a White House spokesman. On Friday,  the Federal Reserve again cut the discount rate, this time by an eye-popping  full percentage point, to 3.5 percent. So where is the economy headed? Has the Administration's  reliance on interest-rate cuts as its major policy lever worked?  Lawrence A. Kudlow, chief economist at Bear Stearns & Company Inc., Marc A. Miles, executive vice president of H. C. Wainwright & Company Economics Inc. and Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Company Inc., shared their views with Joel Kurtzman of The New York Times. 

Q. Is the economy recovering?
 
Mr. Kudlow: Yes, I think there's an unmistakable recovery developing. It's slow and it has caused a tremendous amount of impatience from the public and from the politicians. It is a recovery that has some holes in it. I wouldn't say it's touching all cylinders. But my basic sense is that lower interest rates are a powerful recuperative element in the economy, as is lower inflation.
 
Q. Mr. Sinai, you have an elaborate forecasting model for the economy. Does your model say the economy has recovered?
 
Mr. Sinai: No, no, no. The model doesn't really want to produce anything other than a sideways movement in the economy for another two or three quarters and then a very modest upturn. Typically, recoveries average 6 1/2 percent growth after the downturn has run its course. But this upturn will only have 1 1/2 to 2 percent growth from the fourth quarter of this year to the fourth quarter of next year. Not very many households and businesses will feel that's really a recovery.
 
Mr. Miles: We're very bullish right now. We're bullish about the economy, the stock market and the bond market. All the signals we use are pointing up at this point. There are lag times before growth kicks in.
 
Q. Which signals are those?
 
Mr. Miles: Interest rates are the major signal of what's coming. That's what we've been using for the last decade or so to anticipate trends in the economy. We've estimated that the average time between the drop in interest rates and when you get the maximum positive kick is between 12 and 18 months. Interest rates on three-month T-bills have fallen about 350 basis points since mid-1990. We're looking for higher growth and longer growth. We see '92 and '93 as back-to-back years of 4 to 5 percent growth.
 
Mr. Sinai: He must be working for Bush!
 
Q. When do you see those levels of growth beginning?
 
Mr. Miles: Well, you're asking for a level of precision I don't think any of us have.
 
Q. You mean you don't have an estimate?
 
Mr. Miles: My guess is somewhere around the beginning of the year with the growth rate accelerating into the middle of 1993.
 
Mr. Kudlow: My fourth-quarter figures look pretty flat. But I'm not as pessimistic as Allen on the recovery. I expect a much better first half of 1992, in fact a much better 1992 over all. My numbers suggest about a 3 percent growth rate.
 
Q. What is the effect of the interest-rate cuts?
 
Mr. Kudlow: If we look at the declines in mortgage rates and corporate interest expenses, we come up with something around $40 billion to $50 billion on an annual basis. This is slowly stimulating the economy.
 
Q. Does that make the effect of those cuts similar to a tax cut?
 
Mr. Kudlow: I hate to put it in the Keynesian sense.
 
Q. Will they stimulate the economy as Mr. Miles is suggesting?
 
Mr. Kudlow: They're more like incentives, along with lower inflation. They enable real earnings to improve, the quality of real income to improve. Lower inflation is important with respect to capital investment also. If the inflation rate falls and interest rates fall, it is like getting a de facto cut in the capital-gains rate.
What concerns me more is the long-term economic outlook. With just a 3 percent growth rate for the next four or five years, the U.S. economy will remain below its long-term post-World War II average growth rate. That will put output levels almost $2 trillion below what they would otherwise have been by 1996. At the current growth rate, I estimate there will be six million fewer jobs created than if we had a normal recovery.
 
Q. And you still call it a recovery?
 
Mr. Kudlow: It's a recovery in the technical sense, yes. Some key variables are moving upward.
 
Mr. Miles: This recovery is on track. Industrial production is higher now than last spring. Everything that is happening in the economy is consistent with the history that lower interest rates are associated with weaker growth in the near term but more growth down the road. So, yes, in the near term -- now -- the economy, the recovery, has not been very strong. But it is picking up steam and it is getting stronger.
 
Q. In 1982, the economy was led out of the recession by the entrepreneur. New businesses were formed and jobs were created. Is that happening now?
 
Mr. Kudlow: Not at all. What concerns me -- and it's consistent with the weakness in jobs -- is the lack of any new business formation, new business starts. In fact the whole entrepreneurial sector is moribund. That's different from 1982.
In the last three years the policy signals from Washington -- and the actual legislation -- have been against risk-capital investing. Whether we're talking about the increase in the capital-gains tax or the lengthening of depreciation or the elimination of the passive loss in real estate or the heavy-handed regulation of banks and savings and loans, or the interference with the junk-bond market or the regulatory-related cost increases on businesses from such measures as the Clean Air Act and the Americans With Disabilities Act. All of these are noble objectives. But their consequences are turning out to be rather anti-business and anti-capital formation. It has created uncertainty about the future. People are afraid to make commitments of three, four, five years for venture capital investment.
 
Q. Is that the reason you think the recovery will be subpar?
 
Mr. Kudlow: That's right. It takes a lot to derail the American economy, particularly at these interest-rate levels and inflation levels. But if economic policy is operating against the innovator, against the entrepreneur, against the risk-taker, we're going to see a very low rate of employment increase.
 
Mr. Miles: I never underestimate the ability of Washington to make a bad situation worse.
 
Mr. Sinai: You need lower interest rates and lower inflation to sow the seeds of future growth. But the economy is still missing three things: jobs, income growth and profits. Real income growth has been puny. We've lost more than one million jobs in the last year. And of course profits have been squeezed for three years. I agree; the entrepreneurial incentives are very low.
But we have also had tax increases during the recession that have acted like a brake on growth. That's never happened in the post-war period. We've always used fiscal stimulus. This time Federal taxes were increased by $17.6 billion and state and local taxes increased by $15.4 billion. Another $17 billion in increases are due in 1992. Add to that cutbacks in defense spending in real terms. That's a lot of fiscal restraint to put on a weak economy.
 
Mr. Miles: We're going through an adjustment back to a period that's closer to the 50's and 60's with low inflation and low interest rates and that takes some time. People are shifting away from assets that used to be inflationary hedges. Housing prices are dropping; art prices are dropping; gold prices are dropping. The price of about everything is dropping except baseball cards.
 
Q. Who wins from this switch?
 
Mr. Miles: The stocks of companies that produce basic consumer staples will do better in this longer-term environment -- stocks with stable, consistent earnings, that is. So will small cap stocks -- growth stocks -- where the bulk of the earnings are in later years. Utility companies will do well. They went out of favor in the 1970's with all their long-term debt, but with interest rates falling they are likely to become attractive again. Look at banks. Banks made their money in bygone days by the spread between the rate at which they borrowed money and the rate at which they lent it. That became uncertain for them in the 70's. Now we're going back to a period where the spread will be more dependable and banks will thrive.
 
Q. You're optimistic about banks?
 
Mr. Sinai: We all are. Of the various sectors of the economy, I would say finance is best -- banks and security houses. Banks are expanding and will continue to expand over the next year. The residential side of home building and buying will do better over the next year -- a mini-recovery in housing. The financial side of housing is very favorable. I think manufacturing is going into a slide.
 
 Mr. Kudlow: I like the story on finance. But I think we're going to see surprisingly good manufacturing performance, not only for domestic, but also for international purposes. One of the best initiatives of the Bush Administration has been its revival of Latin America trade. United States capital goods producers, manufacturers, construction companies are going to help rebuild Latin America. I wouldn't be surprised if by the end of the 90's, our exports to Latin America exceed our exports to Western Europe.
 
Q. There is a lot of talk in Washington about tax cuts and other measures to stimulate the economy. President Bush said he will reveal new economic measures during his State of the Union Address next month. What new measures are needed?
 
Mr. Miles: There is a panic going on in Washington and there's a lot of emphasis on doing something. But doing some thing does not necessarily mean you are doing what is right. It is a recipe for creating problems. I haven't seen a proposal coming out of Washington that I like. Most of the proposals involve taking from one group and giving to another: giving to the middle class based on the number of children -- which might make a lot of obstetricians happy -- or taking from the upper-income groups based on their income. I can't see any of this really stimulating the overall economy. I don't see anything positive coming out of all this talk in Washington. The best thing they could do in Washington is just go home.
 
Q. What about further interest-rate cuts?
 
Mr. Miles: It will create more uncertainty.
 
Mr. Kudlow: I happen to agree with Marc on that. I agree with Marc that whenever policy reform is in the air there's a risk it will do more harm than good.
We made a lot of big changes in the '86 tax bill -- some of them I like, such as the lower income-tax rates; some of them I dislike, such as the capital-gains changes and the depreciation. It seems to me that in legislative and in economic terms most of the impacts of the '86 tax bill were felt by around 1988. And I think it's not a coincidence that in the past three years the economy has been stagnating. We've had 0.7 percent real growth in the last 11 quarters.
To me the most egregious mistake in the 1986 tax law revision was the hike in capital gains, curtailing pass-through of depreciation, the abolition of any real estate benefits, the luxury tax and the income-tax hike.
 
Mr. Sinai: The Federal Reserve is moving toward a 4 percent discount rate by the end of the year. And as a prescriptive policy, I would say that shortly after the first of the year it should move the discount rate to 3 1/2 and the Federal funds rate to 3 3/4.
On the fiscal side, I would favor a minimal to modest dose of fiscal-stimulus, short-run measures that would help move growth up toward 1 1/2 or 2 percent on the low side, but measures taken that would also help us in some of our longer-run secular growth problems. And I'll tell you what those are. On the growth side, tax cuts -- and I don't care what form, lower Social Security taxes, income credits for members of a family or lower marginal rates. I happen to like lower marginal rates for $75,000-and-under families and a capital-gains tax reduction. I would also prefer a payroll tax break.
 
Mr. Kudlow: I agree we need a cut in the capital-gains tax.
 
Q. Are you worried these stimulative measures might increase the budget deficit?
 
Mr. Kudlow: I can get through whole days, even weeks at a time, without worrying about the budget deficit.

HEADLINE: Some Quality-Testing Methods

 BODY:
BEFORE looking at policy illustrations, it makes sense to compile a list of companies you might want to do business with. Good financial planners are beginning to shop from a short list of insurers that meet specific criteria.
For example, Andrew Wray, a planner in Memphis, looks for an insurer that has been rated A+ for the past 10 years by A. M. Best & Company in Oldwick, N.J., the only agency that has been rating insurers at least that long. The insurer also must be rated at least AA by one of the other three leading ratings agencies: Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Services in New York and Duff & Phelps in Chicago. Mr. Wray rules out any insurer that has a rating below a "contingent A" by Best, an AA- by S.& P. or Duff & Phelps or an Aa3 by Moody's. Ratings from these companies are available by calling the company and asking for the ratings desk. 
 It is also important to know how the insurer has treated existing policyholders. Some apply the same interest rate across the board, adjusting older policies to reflect the company's more recent experience.
But others sort policyholders into groups, marketing new products with competitive rates but leaving existing policyholders with lower rates. "You want to know how fairly they treated old policyholders in the past," said Harold Evensky, a Miami planner.

HEADLINE: Business Is Booming At Consignment Shops

BYLINE: By DEBORAH BLUMENTHAL

 BODY:
Picture a boutique where a Chanel suit sells for less than a third of its original price. Or a shop offering Ralph Lauren boots for $70, an Armani blouse for $150 or a sequined evening suit by Bob Mackie for $550 -- instead of, say, $3,000. Wishful thinking? Not at all. These and similar bargains were recently spotted at consignment shops on Madison Avenue.
From coast to coast, resourceful shoppers with an eye toward a bargain are reaping the benefits of buying recycled designer clothes at consignment shops, which have become one of the country's booming recession-time businesses. People are buying everything from children's overalls to men's dinner jackets and women's sparkling sequined ball gowns at a fraction of their original cost. 
 Consumers benefit from consignment shops in two ways. People with clothes to discard earn back some of their original investment, while budget-conscious shoppers gain access to designer clothing at low cost.
 
Picking and Finding

 
 "If you pick through them, you'll always find something," said Marlene Brown, a substitute teacher at Public School 6 in Manhattan, who shops at the consignment shop Encore, 1132 Madison Avenue, at 84th Street.
One day Mrs. Brown went to Hermes to buy a navy blue patterned scarf. "They were over $200 and I couldn't find one that I liked," she said. "Then I went past Encore and something called my name and boom, there it was: the perfect navy scarf with red and gold. It was $85."
Natasha Anzell, a market research supervisor, raves about Designer Resale, 324 East 81st Street. "I only buy labels," Ms. Anzell said, "and the first time I walked in here, I bought a Donna Karan navy blue crepe suit. It was stunning and brand new. I paid about $150."
Consignment shops accept high-quality used clothing in perfect or near-perfect condition and sometimes clothing that has never been worn. They then sell them at a third or less of the original cost and generally pay those who offer the clothes 40 or 50 percent of the selling price.
"We're getting clothes from women who used to dump them, or give them to their housekeeper or relatives in Hungary," said Laura Fluhr, owner of Michael, a long-established resale shop at 1041 Madison Avenue in New York.
 
Money for Throwaways

 
 Emilie Tribich, for example, a Manhattan woman who confesses to being something of a shopping addict, earned close to $1,000 this year on clothing that she and her husband consigned for sale at the Exchange Unlimited in the Murray Hill section of Manhattan. "It's a tremendous amount of money for stuff I would throw away," she said.
The consignment market has traditionally catered to women and children, but in the last few years, some men's shops have opened up, and business is flourishing. At Gentlemen's Closet in Houston, sales are up by 61 percent over last year, according to Toni Coleman, the owner. The biggest demands, she said, are for clothes by Giorgio Armani. "We sell them as fast as we get them."
Armani suits that would retail for up to $1,200 are $179 to $199, Ms. Coleman said. Tuxedos are also strong sellers. They range in price from $70 to $150, less than one might spend to rent one.
There are no figures available on the exact number of consignment shops, but membership in the National Association of Resale and Thrift Shops, based in Chicago, has increased from 150 five years ago to 850 members today. A flourishing offshoot, particularly at this time of year, is the growing business of renting party clothes, not just men's tuxedos, but women's gowns and accessories.
"People are more concerned than ever about being smart shoppers," said Trudy Miller, the organization's president, who runs a shop in Chicago Heights called Second Thoughts.
Despite the sharp increases in the industry, there is still a stigma attached to the idea of wearing someone else's clothes.
"We're trying to overcome that all the time," Ms. Miller said, "but those who feel uncomfortable with the idea of wearing used clothing probably haven't been in resale shops. Once we get them in the door we can convert them to customers."
But some of those shoppers might not mind taking advantage of a special sale at the Gene London Studio, 897 Broadway (between 19th and 20th Streets), which is not normally open to the public, through Jan. 7, including today. Castoffs from celebrities like Cher, Madonna and Elizabeth Taylor as well as thousands of other clothes made for the film industry by Gene London will be available. The sale also includes designer clothes by Chanel, Norman Norell and Scaasi, and men's clothing at as little as 10 percent of their original cost.
To keep high quality and current stock, many resale shops have strict guidelines about the merchandise they accept. When garments are brought in, they are carefully inspected for signs of wear and tear. As much as half the merchandise offered to consignment shops is turned away, some proprietors say.
At Michael, pieces must be "perfect," no more than a year and a half old (the shop can usually tell if an item is dated) and in women's sizes ranging from 4 to 12. (Larger sizes don't sell well.)
"The better the quality, the faster it goes," said Ms. Fluhr of Michael, the Manhattan shop. The biggest demands, she said, are for clothes from Chanel and Armani.
On a recent visit to the shop, the racks included clothing with both names at less than half their retail cost. A navy Chanel suit, size 8 (at least $2,700 new), was on sale for $750. A silk chiffon Armani blouse, size 8, was $150, down from more than $600 new. A black satin Chanel bag was $275; new ones start at $800.
At the Encore shop just a few blocks up from Michael on Madison Avenue, a recent visit uncovered some enticing new items. Short unworn black leather boots by Ralph Lauren, size 10, were $70, instead of roughly $225. Unworn Chanel flats, size 10, were $200, down from more than $400.
While bargains abound at consignment shops around the country, some proprietors say that the best buys for shoppers in consignment shops are on formal wear that is often worn just once, as opposed to a suit that might have been worn repeatedly.
It's possible to find choice items any time of the year, but arm loads of top clothing often arrive at the end of August and March, when people clean out their closets.
The children's market is well suited to recycling since clothing is worn for such a short time in smaller sizes. At Second Act, a children's wear shop on Madison Avenue in Manhattan, the items that sell best are the most practical ones.
"The smock dress or the Austrian coat sit here," said Joan Blake, the owner. "People are only buying truly what they need" -- like jeans, corduroy pants and winter boots.
Many consignment shops maintain a low profile, aware that buyers may not want to announce to the world where their Chanel clothes -- or even children's garments -- come from.
Unlike Bloomingdale's and Saks Fifth Avenue, said Ms. Fluhr of Michael, "We don't put our name on our shopping bags."

BYLINE: By Robert Byrne

 BODY:
There are players who look for easy marks because they don't want to risk losing. They are not interested in glorious adventures. But there are others who want to cross swords with the very best, to prove themselves in a hot crucible. The latter are more likely to become champions.
One of the latter is the United States champion 17-year-old Gata Kamsky of Brooklyn. In the elite Interpolis International Tournament in Tilburg, the Netherlands, Oct. 17 to Nov. 4 he made a highly respectable even score. But that gave no hint of how his games went with the world champion, Gary Kasparov of the Soviet Union, and with Kasparov's countryman and challenger for the title, Anatoly Karpov. 
 Kamsky twice got the upper hand against Kasparov, only to see this illustrious opponent escape with two draws. Kamsky's first game with Karpov was a level draw all the way, but he won the second with the type of solid, tenacious positional play for which his opponent is famous.
In the 1990 world championship match in New York and Lyons, France, Karpov used this Exchange Variation of the Gruenfeld Defense to score one victory and three draws against Kasparov. But this was the first time he has used 9 Rb1 and it is doubtful that the provoked 9 . . . a6 represents any kind of weakness for Black.
The method chosen by Kamsky was straightforward: exchange queens so White cannot try for a mating attack and play 13 . . . e6 to restrain the d pawn, and economical development. His 20 . . . Nb5! was unpleasant for Karpov to meet. Thus, 21 Be3? loses to 21 . . . Nc3, while 21 d5 ed 22 ed Nc3 23 Bc3 Rc3 yields Black a chance to bring about exchanges that could permit him to approach and win the d pawn with his king.
Karpov chose e5, yet this immobilized his center pawns and encouraged Kamsky to embark on a strategy of infiltration.
Kamsky's exchange of bishop for knight with 28 . . . Be1! was based on the idea that with pawns fixed on e5 and d4, the white QB was restricted in scope. Moreover, it was correct to stop Karpov from playing 29 Nd3 and then either 30 Nc5 or 30 Nf4.
On 46 g4, Kamsky declined to grab a pawn with 46 . . . Na5 because that would have let the white rook penetrate on the c line and, with the QB, organize counterplay against the black king.
Instead, he produced a beautiful pawn sacrifice with 46 . . . Ra1 47 Rc3 Rh1 48 Kg3 g5! 49 hg h4. After 50 Kg2 Re1, Karpov could not play 51 Kf2? because of 51 . . . h3!, nor 51 Bc4 because of 51 . . . Bc4 52 Rc4 Kg6 53 f4 (53 Kh3 Re3! 54 Kh4 Rf3 puts the white king in danger of such machinations as . . . Ne7, . . . Nd5 and . . . Nf4) Re3 followed by 54 . . . Rg3, recovering the pawn with a death grip on the light squares.
Facing the threat of 56 . . . Rg2 and 57 . . . h3, Karpov played 56 Rd3 and was immediately crushed by Kamsky's 56 . . . Rg2 57 Kf1 Re2! 58 Ke2 Bc4. The ex-champion played 59 d5 ed 60 Kd2 Bd3 61 Kd3, but after 61 . . . d4!, he could not stop the two passed pawns except by losing his bishop.
After 72 . . . a5, there was no point in going further with 73 e6 fe 74 Ke6 a4 75 f6 Kg6 76 f7 Nd8. Karpov gave up.

HEADLINE: It's a Mean One;
There's No Place To Hide From The Economic Blues

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
FROM the beginning of the Bush Presidency, the tune from Washington on the economy was upbeat. At first, the soaring 1980's were said to be ending in a soft landing. When the recession hit last year, it was promised to be short and mild. By late last spring, the policymakers were assuring the country that the corner had been turned and new prosperity was at hand.
Last week, the music changed. 
 In an abrupt about-face, the White House acknowledged for the first time what millions have perceived and Democrats have harped on for weeks. "The people of this country know that the economy is in trouble," said Marlin Fitzwater, the press secretary, "and it doesn't make any sense to play games."
To dramatize his determination to ease what he began calling "tough times," Mr. Bush went to Texas the next day, donned a hard hat and said: "Yes, there are layoffs and many families are having a rough go of it, and the American people want action. And action is what they'll get. And I want every American to know that getting the economy back on track is my No. 1 priority."
While the President was traveling, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and the Government's most influential economic policymaker, was telling Congress that his optimism earlier this year had been unjustified and the economy now was flagging.
On Friday, in an almost desperate effort to reverse the momentum, the Fed took the dramatic step of reducing the discount rate by a percentage point to 3.5 percent, the lowest since 1964. It was the first time in 10 years that this key rate, what the central bank charges banks for loans, had been cut by a full point in one day.
Why the turnabout? In part it was because the raw data on the economy could no longer be denied. In part it was because at the start of the week, John H. Sununu was replaced as White House chief of staff by former Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner, who advocates a new public relations approach. The most important reason was probably that as the election year neared, the President was being battered by Democrats accusinghim of being out of touch with many ordinary Americans.
 
Little Consumer Confidence
 The week's economic statistics were indeed stark: The Federal Reserve reported that industrial production, one of the main gauges of current business activity, fell by an unexpectedly large four-tenths of 1 percent in November. Housing starts were off 2.1 percent last month, almost guaranteeing that 1991 will be the worst year for home builders since World War II. A Commerce Department survey found that businesses plan to increase investments in plants and equipment next year by only 5.4 percent, much less than what could be anticipated in a normal recovery. New applications for unemployment benefits in the first week in December reached one of their highest levels in more than eight years.
The data did not tell the whole story. Consumer confidence, as measured by the index of the Conference Board, a widely followed business research group, is at one of its lowest points ever. Mr. Greenspan said the mood of the country was much worse than economic conditions warranted. "There is a deep-seated concern out there, which I must say to you I have not seen in my lifetime," he told the House Ways and Means Committee. People, he said, are worried "about whether the current generation will live as well as previous ones."
The real killer came Wednesday, when General Motors announced that it would close 21 of its plants in the United States and Canada over the next few years and eliminate more than 70,000 jobs. The timing of the announcement the week before Christmas multiplied the shock.
 
Cue From Reagan
 In a political sense, an underlying aspect made the layoffs even worse. The jobs being abolished at the automotive plants are the kind of high-paying manufacturing jobs that were the foundation of the flourishing American middle class in the 1950's and 1960's. The basis of the Democratic campaign against the President is that while fat cats thrived in the Reagan and Bush years, the middle class faltered badly. Robert C. Stempel, G.M.'s chairman and chief executive, whose compensation last year was $1,074,695, is one of a group of business executives going to the Far East with the President late this month. After a meeting about the trip in the White House Thursday, Mr. Stempel was ushered out a back door to avoid reporters.
Mr. Skinner took over in the West Wing of the White House Monday morning and put out the word that he wanted an "inclusive approach" to policy development "to let valued advice get to the President."
Since before Thanksgiving, the Democrats have been hammering the President on the economy at every opportunity. At last Sunday night's debate of the six Democratic Presidential candidates, the one common theme was that Mr. Bush had no notion of how people were suffering. Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa set the tone in answer to the very first question about why he had decided to run for President.
"I started thinking about what was really happening to this country," Mr. Harkin declared. "And I saw more and more people going out of work. I saw families without hope.
"And then what I saw was, I saw a President completely out of touch with the American people," he added. "George Bush doesn't understand ordinary, hard-working Americans. He has no concept of what's going on. He's isolated from the American people."
Each of the other candidates chimed in with a similar piece. The Democrats have taken a cue from Ronald Reagan. He was elected President in 1980 in large part because he articulated how disturbed ordinary people were by the social excesses of the 1960's and 1970's -- more crime, more welfare, racial tension, freer sex, lack of patriotism. The Democrats hope they can win next year by emphasizing how upset people are by the economic binge of the 1980's that favored wealthy investors over working people.
The effect on the President of the staggering economy and the constant pounding from the Democrats was unmistakable. After the war against Iraq, about 90 percent of Americans said they liked the way he was doing his job. The most recent national poll, taken by the Washington Post and ABC News from Dec. 11 through Dec. 15, showed his approval rating at 47 percent, the lowest of any President at this stage of his first term since World War II except for Gerald R. Ford. Only one person in four in this latest poll approved of the way Mr. Bush was handling the economy.
There is little mystery about what caused the economic problems. The country is suffering a hangover from the mergers, rampant speculation, overbuilding, heavy borrowing and irresponsible Government fiscal policy of the 1980's. Businesses, banks and families are now cutting back.
Still, there is no consensus about what to do to get the economy back on its feet. No leading politician, least of all the Democratic Presidential candidates, has suggested radical surgery. Dozens of lawmakers are sponsoring one kind of tax cut or another, many of them involving a tax reduction focused on the middle class, and the Administration will probably go along. But few experts believe that a tax reduction of, say, $300 a family, within the range under consideration, would make much difference overall.
A tax cut that would give the economy a quick jolt would also increase the budget deficit, which could reach a stratospheric $375 billion this year anyway. That could spook the financial markets. The rise in interest rates that could come from an increased fear of inflation might offset whatever kick the economy got from consumers' spending their newfound wealth and might damage the economy over the long run.
But reducing Government spending and enacting inducements for consumers to save, which would stimulate investment and improve the situation in the long run, would put an immediate drag on the economy, the wrong prescription for curing a recession.
But as a political matter, sitting tight and riding out the recession, as Mr. Greenspan and several other prominent economists counseled, is out of the question. The President and the Democrats who control Congress are incumbents, and incumbents cannot afford to sit on their hands while businesses fail and workers lose their jobs.

How an Old Government Reactor Managed to Outlive the Cold War

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
THE last surviving piece of equipment for making nuclear fuel for the American arsenal, the 37-year-old K-Reactor, was designed to survive a one-megaton blast from a Soviet bomb at a range of two miles. But today environmentalists are more worried about a different kind of blast; they note that the outmoded reactor would not survive a far smaller internal explosion without dumping at least part of its radioactive entrails into the piney wetlands of western South Carolina.
Last week the Secretary of Energy, James D. Watkins, said what had long been obvious: since the other big competitor in the nuclear arms race is giving up, much of the American bomb-production system is no longer needed. But as he spoke the K-Reactor, on the Savannah River Site, near Aiken, S.C., was awakening from a three-and-a-half-year slumber to resume the production of tritium for bombs. Mr. Watkins said it would run as a backup until an alternate source was found. While the Energy Department was busy converting its mission from making weapons to dismantling and decontaminating its troubled bomb factories, Mr. Watkins reiterated that a new reactor may be in the wings. 
 It was the latest in mixed signals as the Government tries to adapt its nuclear weapons complex to a new age. The Department of Energy has spent about $1 billion on re-opening the K-Reactor, one of five built in the early 1950's for the production of plutonium and tritium. The reactor was closed in 1988 because of safety problems. When department officials took reporters on a tour of the site earlier this month they said they planned to spend a billion more.
To some extent the problem is simply inertia in what sometimes seems less a defense program than a public works project. The Savannah River Site, like most government nuclear reservations, dominates the economy of the surrounding region and has powerful political patrons.
But the situation also reflects the Government's uncertainty about what the nuclear future holds. Given the delays the department has encountered in building plants far simpler than reactors -- for example, it recently built and abandoned a new factory for making submarine fuel, a few miles away -- officials seem determined to insure that no matter how many nuclear powers this country faces a decade from now, in the former Soviet Union or elsewhere, it will have a way to make tritium. This could be done with a new reactor or a particle accelerator, but for now the job is left to the coddled K-Reactor, which officials insist is safe since it will be run at only 30 percent power.
 
Cleaning Up Wastes
 The K-Reactor is now dedicated solely to making tritium, which is used to enhance explosive yield, allowing for smaller, more maneuverable bombs. But tritium, like all radioactive elements, slowly decays. It is transformed at the rate of about 5.5 percent a year, meaning that even a shrinking arsenal will require tritium production eventually. Weapons in the field, or at least their tritium reservoirs, must be returned to Savannah River to be replenished.
But with the cold war becoming a memory, some environmentalists are pushing to give up the plant, which lacks many modern safety features. Even in accident-free operation, they say, the reactor creates liquid wastes even more difficult to handle than those from civilian reactors, which are in solid form. The Energy Department chops up its fuel and dissolves it in acid to recover unused uranium and the plutonium.
And tritium itself is nasty to deal with. The gas is so difficult to contain and so readily taken up by the body that visitors to the K-Reactor must "provide bioassay samples" (urinate in a cup), twice -- once before they enter and once when they leave.
Some environmentalists say that as disarmament proceeds, it would be safer to scavenge tritium from retired warheads. A study recently completed for the Energy Research Foundation, a South Carolina environmental group, concluded that recycling could probably supply the remainder of the arsenal for about a decade. But the Energy Department wants a longer supply.
Engineers have long been aware of the advancing age of the K-Reactor and the four similar reactors built nearby; one was permanently sidelined by a crack in the reactor vessel. In the late 1970's, when the plants were approaching what some already thought was the end of their useful lives, the Carter Administration cut back tritium production, believing that international tensions were easing. Then President Reagan embarked on a huge arms build-up, and the reactors began new production schedules. Through the 1980's, some in Congress fought for a new production reactor, but the department, still trying to get the most bang for the buck, delayed. Last Monday, Mr. Watkins said that a new reactor might be built, but that it would be smaller than previously planned.
For now, though, the focus is still on the old plant, where in preparation for re-start, operators have completed a 1,000-hour training course, and have been divided into five platoons, enough to insure round-the-clock manning of the control room, vacations and days off, and one shift always in training. The plan is for the reactor to run until October 1992, when workers will remove the aluminum-clad cylinders in which tritium has been produced. Recovery of the gas must wait until early 1993, when heat and radiation have died down.
But as might be predicted for an old machine that has been idle for years, preliminary testing found new squeaks and rattles. In a test, operators withdrew all 66 control rods, one at a time. When raised in unison, these rods allow the neutron flow that sustains the chain reaction; when lowered, they shut the reaction down. But one rod refused to fully lower, so the mechanics and engineers went back to work. Now they say startup will be soon.

HEADLINE: THE END OF THE SOVIET UNION;
11 SOVIET STATES FORM COMMONWEALTH WITHOUT CLEARLY DEFINING ITS POWERS

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALMA-ATA, Kazakhstan, Dec. 21

 BODY:
Eleven former republics of the Soviet Union formally constituted themselves today as the Commonwealth of Independent States, dedicated to reversing their slide toward economic and political chaos.
Putting aside seven decades of central dictatorship, the republic leaders meeting in the Kazakh capital, near the Chinese border, negotiated and signed a broad commonwealth agreement that guarantees their separate sovereignties but leaves unsettled such important issues as how to create an acceptable system of command to administer common military policy and nuclear weapons control. 
 The top governmental body will be a council of heads of state and government, assisted by committees of republic ministers in key areas like foreign affairs, defense and economics.
 
Next Step: Ratification
 Full operations are promised to begin no later than Jan. 15, after ratification by the 11 republics' parliaments. The Baltic states, which regained independence in September, are not participating, nor is Georgia, which instead sent an observer to the talks.
To emphasize their resolve to move beyond the Kremlin, the commonwealth leaders pre-emptively accepted the resignation of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, even though it has not yet been submitted.
Their evident urgency to see him leave was reflected in their decision to promise, "with respect," a generous pension once he is in retirement.
 
'Want Him to Go Gently'
 "We respect Gorbachev and want him to go gently into retirement in December, as he himself wants," said President Boris N. Yeltsin of the Russian federated republic, who is head of the biggest and most powerful of the new commonwealth's constituent parts and who has been Mr. Gorbachev's chief reform antagonist through the last four turbulent years.
"We do not want to carry on the tradition since 1917 of burying our heads of state and having to rebury them later or having to pronounce them criminal," Mr. Yeltsin said. "A civilized state should end this practice."
There was no direct reaction from Mr. Gorbachev, who has suffered a breathtaking fall from power and grace since the failed coup in August. But in an interview with CBS News, he indicated that he would resign shortly after receiving official notification of the results of the Alma-Ata meeting.
"As soon as I receive official documents and see that the commonwealth is a reality, within a few days I will then take my decision," Mr. Gorbachev said. The Soviet leader said that for the meantime, he and the Defense Minister remained in control of the "nuclear button."
Mr. Gorbachev, who initially denounced the commonwealth as illegal and dangerous, today spoke of the new association as an accomplished fact. But he warned Americans that they too faced a difficult transition, saying: "I don't think the transformation will be easy and simple from one partner, the Soviet Union and its leadership. Now you have to deal with 10 new politicians."
Today was the first full working session of the expanded commonwealth. It is designed to be the vehicle for the survivors of the fallen Soviet empire to head toward free-market prosperity and full democracy. It grew out of the founding body announced 13 days ago by Russia, Ukraine and Byelorussia, the three Slavic republics, when they met in Byelorussia and pronounced that the Soviet Union had ceased to exist.
 
Democracies Ruled by Law
 The meeting today went a considerable step beyond, for not only was the new association enlarged and sealed with pledges of peaceful collaboration, but also the heads of state began settling some differences.
In a joint declaration, the leaders set forth their intent to "build democratic states ruled by law and to develop relations between them on the basis of mutual recognition of inalienable right to self-determination, equality, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, renunciation of the use of force or threat to use force, economic or other levers of pressure."
The agreement next must be submitted to the republics' parliaments for ratification. Once they certify this with authorities in Byelorussia, the commonwealth is under way.
The leaders also yielded to President Yeltsin's view that Russia should take over the Security Council seat in the United Nations held until now by the Soviet Union. The Russian Foreign Minister, Andrei Kozyrev, said later that this was critical for the general nuclear control strategy of eventually seeing Russia succeed the Soviet Union as the single guarantor of disarmament.
The broad-stroke agreements constituted an important political accord but left almost every difficult, concrete issue to be decided later, including such basic matters as the economy and Government financing, the precise scope of the new coordinating agencies, borders and citizenship.
The agreements signed today did not specifically mention a common currency or the ruble, but spoke of adherence in principle to the agreement from the Byelorussia meeting, which did call for a common currency. Today's agreements also noted that some republics had expressed reservations on the Byelorussia agreement.
The refining of the agreements was left to the uncertain hands of the republic parliaments.
In line with this, the four republics with long-range nuclear missiles on their soil -- Russia, Byelorussia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan -- again insisted that they were in agreement on joint weapons safeguards, and they issued a statement to this effect. This issue is a central one being pressed by the Bush Administration and other governments as one of the prices for early recognition of commonwealth members.
"This document will answer all the questions being asked by other states," said Kazakhstan's President, Nursultan A. Nazarbayev. The Bush Administration has various questions and uncertainties and wants to send nuclear disarmament specialists next month to see to some of the problems.
The document may not prove entirely reassuring, for Kazakhstan appears to be continuing to insist that it be treated on a par with Russia rather than joining Ukraine and Byelorussia in eventually ceding nuclear controls to Russia.
 
Military Command Unresolved
 And republic leaders could not agree immediately on the related issue of a new military command. This focuses on the precise design of a permanent defense council that is to administer commonwealth military policy.
Such important commonwealth members as Ukraine are especially insistent that the new defense council offer no opportunity to revive central totalitarianism, nor conflict with republic plans to form separate armies.
The commonwealth members put off the military command issue, scheduling it as the topic of a meeting Dec. 30 in Minsk, the Byelorussian capital, which is to be the commonwealth headquarters. As a temporary measure, the republic carried over until the end of the year the central remnant of the union's Defense Ministry, led by General Yevgeny I. Shaposhnikov.
The commonwealth agreement was signed in the heart of this snow-decked mountainside city north of the Chinese border. The ceremony was held at the House of Friendship, a bulky exercise in socialist overdesign, where legions of republic leaders, ministers and patronage retinues showed up for the new post-Communist roundtable, smiling and squinting in the TV lamplight of world attention.
The commonwealth members held a news conference this evening, seated by small freshly minted flags of their sovereign republics under a huge bronze-toned medallion that still bore the hammer and sickle of Communism.
On the issue of approval by the republics' parliaments, various sorts of political flurries are expected. The Ukraine Parliament, which is wary and nationalistic about the commonwealth, has underlined its right to withdraw. Ukraine's lawmakers, passing the earlier commonwealth agreement after the Byelorussia meeting this month, made some adjustments in the agreement before approving it.

U.S. Silent on Recognition
 WASHINGTON, Dec. 21 (AP) -- The Bush Administration offered congratulations to the 11 former Soviet republics on formation of a new commonwealth today, but stopped short of saying when it would formally recognize the new governments.
"We hope the agreement will help to provide a stable and peaceful environment to permit the individual republics to pursue democracy and market economy reforms," said White House spokeswoman Judy Smith.

 Leaders of 11 of the 12 former Soviet republics proclaimed a new Commonwealth of Independent States at a meeting in the Kazakh capital, Alma-Ata. They agreed on the following points.
 
EQUAL BASIS PROTOCOL
 
The 11 republics will be considered co-founders. This was a principal demand of the leaders of the five Asian republics after the Slavic republics, Russia, Byelorussian and Ukraine, formed the commonwealth Dec. 8. The eight republics agreeing to join the commonwealth are the five Asian republics (Kazakhstan, Turkmenia, Uzberkistan, Kirghizia and Tadzhikistan) plus Armenia, Moldavia and Azerbaijan.
 
ALMA-ATA DECLARATION
 
This document recognizes the independence of the 11 former Soviet republics and their current borders.
 
MILITARY COMMAND
 
A temporary military command will exist until Dec. 31. The 11 leaders are to meet again on control of the military on Dec. 30 in Minsk, the headquarters of teh commonwealth. Yevgeny I. Shaposhnikov, the Soviet Defense Minister, is to lead the interim command.
 
UNITED NATIONS STATUS
 
The republics agreed that Russia would take over the Soviet Union's seat on the U.N. Security Concil. Russia and the two republics already represented at the United Nations, Ukrain and Byelorussia, will push for all the other republics to have U.N. seasts as well. (pg. 12)

HEADLINE: THE END OF THE SOVIET UNION;
Baker Doubtful Commonwealth Will Last Long

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Dec. 21

 BODY:
After a week of visiting the crumbling Soviet Union, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d left believing that the republics' new commonwealth has little chance of long-term survival, and that Washington will soon be dealing with a dozen independent states with different policies and varied prospects for success.
By that view, the former Soviet republics are now so enamored of the idea of independence that they cannot work together for long in a meaningful commonwealth, with joint economic and military policies, until they feel the real costs of coming apart. 
 That assessment was given to reporters traveling with Mr. Baker as he prepared to return to the United States today to brief President Bush on his visit to Russia, Kirghizia, Kazakhstan, Byelorussia and Ukraine -- all of which will probably be recognized by Washington before the end of the year.
 
Brittle Commonwealth
 Summing up Mr. Baker's overall impressions, reporters were told: "Whether there is a commonwealth or not, we are going to end up dealing with sovereign, independent nations. Instead of dealing with one foreign minister, it might well end up being 12."
"The richness of our relationships will depend from republic to republic on the degree to which they embrace democracy and free markets" as well as the republics' fulfilling their assurances to the United States on nuclear security, an official said.
The "only thing that is for sure," reporters with Mr. Baker were told, "is that you should have gone out and bought some Rand McNally stock some time ago" -- referring to the map company, which must revise its publications.
Mr. Baker's visit, destined to be the last by an American Secretary of State to the Soviet Union, was a bizarre journey in many ways, turning up a few clues from three scenes in particular.
The first scene could be called sauna diplomacy.
Last Wednesday, Mr. Baker visited Kazakhstan, near the border with China. As he was meeting there with President Nursultan A. Nazarbayev, the Kazakh leader suggested that he and Mr. Baker get away from the conference table for a more informal chat -- in his sauna.
So at 1:30 A.M. the two men drove up to a villa in the mountains, stripped naked, and, with a State Department interpreter in tow, retreated into the sauna. There, as the snow fell heavily outside, the Kazakh from the steppes of Central Asia and the Texan from Houston, discussed the fate of the Soviet Union until almost 3 A.M.
Earlier in the day, while Mr. Baker was visiting Bishkek, the capital of Kirghizia, the President of that republic dressed Mr. Baker in a multicolored Kirghiz robe and hat, so he could get a better feel for the local color.
And Mr. Baker did see a lot of local color. In fact, if he drew one conclusion from his trip, it was that the United States is going to have to deal with a lot of different local colors -- probably too many -- from now on.
Mr. Baker concluded that forces pulling the Soviet Union apart are so strong that the individual republics will soon be pursuing their own homemade economic policies -- with their own currencies, degrees of free-market drive and possibly protectionist practices.
Republics like Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Kirghizia, which are rich in natural resources, have quick-footed leaders eager to cut deals with Western businesses, and relatively homogeneous populations. But the prospects are less clear for republics like Russia, which has a high potential for infighting among the leadership and 100 ethnic minorities that could pull the republic apart further from within.
In fact, reporters were told that Mr. Baker left Russia feeling that "things have broken down there -- everything has broken down." The distribution system has collapsed, middle-class families are having to forage for food and crime is rampant. Without emergency food shipments, officials said, social unrest is likely in the cities before the winter is out.
If the West is lucky, reporters were told, the commonwealth will be able to maintain at least a common defense policy that will allow for a single, unified command over nuclear weapons until they can be dismantled in every republic except Russia. But even that remains questionable.
 
Toeing U.S. Line
 Another scene could be called the pro-American competition.
Wherever Mr. Baker went on this trip, leaders seemed to be competing to see who could seem the most pro-American, pro-democratic and pro-capitalist.
President Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan told Mr. Baker that he now keeps a copy of the "Baker five principles," in the top drawer of this desk. Those principles were laid out by Mr. Baker as a sort of informal yardstick for United States relations with the newly independent republics. They are very general principles -- things like "we support democracy and the rule of law" and "the safeguarding of human rights."
The leader who managed to seem most pro-American was Askar A. Akayev, President of Kirghizia, who said at his news conference in Bishkek with Mr. Baker: "I think if one looks at the memorable speech of the Secretary of State that he gave on Dec. 12 at Princeton and those principles which he enunciated there, and also the fact that the United States has taken a leadership position in not only implementing those principles but also in all the programs and aid that the United States is heading up, this will give us an opportunity to make this transition thanks to the United States."
Those extraordinary displays by former Soviet officials were at once encouraging and disconcerting to the Baker party. They were encouraging because the values the leaders were espousing were Western values instead of worn-out Marxist ones, but they were worrisome because some of the performances seemed as thin and empty as the apocryphal "Potemkin villages" the Russian field marshal supposedly built along the route of Catherine the Great's tour of the Crimea to impress her.
Mr. Baker had a news conference in Kiev with President Leonid M. Kravchuk, during which Mr. Kravchuk seemed to say everything Mr. Baker wanted to hear. Later, Dora Chomiak, a recent Princeton University graduate who has been working in Kiev, commented on the coverage of the Baker visit by American correspondents.
"It's pretty funny," said Miss Chomiak, who works for the Ukrainian-American Renaissance Foundation. "I mean, I hear you reporting that Kravchuk promised this and Kravchuk said that, and I have to tell you he says a lot of things that the people want to hear, but a lot of it never gets done. Or when it does, it's sort of slapped together. Right after Kravchuk signed the first commonwealth agreement in Brest, he came back to the Parliament here to get it ratified and it was really a farce. I mean, they didn't debate it. Half the members didn't even know what they were voting on."
A third scene could be called Greetings and Farewells.
When Mr. Baker's delegation got word that President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia intended to meet them for the first time ever in the Kremlin, seated in the same room, at the same table and in the same chair in which President Gorbachev used to meet them, they bristled. They saw it as a crude attempt by Mr. Yeltsin to rub Mr. Gorbachev's nose in his political defeat. When Mr. Baker shook hands with Mr. Yeltsin that day in Catherine's hall, he looked stiff and uncomfortable.
Eight hours later, Mr. Baker was holding a news conference with Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze. It was an emotional scene as they met in the building where they had done so much business together. Mr. Shevardnadze bear-hugged several members of Mr. Baker's staff when they left. Mr. Baker kept calling him "my friend and colleague."
Why will Mr. Baker miss Mr. Shevardnadze? Reporters traveling with the Baker party were told: "I will miss him because he was a man of great integrity" and because "he's a very reasonable, rational person."
American officials don't like Mr. Yeltsin. In part it is because they believe he is less predictable than Mr. Gorbachev and in part because he did in their friends. The terms they use to describe him are: "crude," "populist," "peasant-like," "impulsive."
"By the end," said an American official, "Baker could deal with Shevardnadze as though he were an allied foreign minister. Yeltsin is more gruff, feisty, rude. Even though we like his politics more, we still find the man off-putting. The way he drove the final nails into the coffins of Gorbachev and Shevardnadze, with such alacrity, made us all shudder."
The "funny thing" is, though, the official said, "Yeltsin was always closer to our ideas of what needed to be done inside the Soviet Union than Shevardnadze or Gorbachev. He was actually listening while we were lecturing and the other guys were not. But it was like in deposing Gorbachev he deposed our friends, and it is going to take time to get over that."

HEADLINE: A Side Effect Of Rates Cuts

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
It has been an article of faith among economists and government officials for decades that when the economy goes bad, the Federal Reserve can fix the problem by lowering interest rates. Lower rates make it cheaper for consumers to take on expensive purchases like cars and appliances and for companies to invest in plants and equipment.
In this slump, that solution has not worked, at least, not yet. But on Friday the Federal Reserve signaled its determination to keep trying, with a vengeance. It slashed the discount rate a full point, the steepest cut in 10 years, to a 27-year low of 3 1/2 percent. Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said the economic recovery seemed to have stalled earlier this year, after regaining about half the recession's losses. 
 Many economists think that the medicine will produce the desired recovery, although few think it will be an especially strong one.
But if economists and politicians typically think of lower interest rates as unalloyed good news, for millions of Americans, particularly the elderly, lower rates are bad news. The fact that rates for savers have fallen faster than rates for borrowers has slowed the recovery.
"Almost every time I turn around, my electricity bill goes up, or my water bill or my telephone bill," complained Joann Brokaw, who is 62 years old and was buying presents for her grandchildren last week in Columbus, Ohio. "At the same time, the money I have coming in is going down." She said she was earning 9 1/2 percent on bank certificates of deposit a year ago. Now the interest she receives is down to around 5 percent, and heading lower.
A Gallup Poll, taken for Fidelity Investments over Thanksgiving weekend, found that more people over 50 years old thought they had been hurt rather than helped by lower interest rates. But a clear majority of respondents under 50 believed lower rates had improved their financial position.
There does not seem to be such a sharp split among economists. Even before the latest rate cut, all but one of the more than 50 economists polled earlier this month by Blue Chip Economic Indicators, a newsletter, believe the American economy would grow in 1992. The dissenter thought there would be no growth but no decline either.
But in previous recessions, the interest paid on savings has fallen much more rapidly than rates on auto loans, credit cards or home mortgages. A year ago, the average six-month bank certificate of deposit was paying 7.14 percent; now it is 4.46 percent, a decline of 2.68 percentage points. But the rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has fallen only 1.10 percentage points, to 8.38 percent.
While all six-month C.D.'s taken at higher rates have expired, most mortgages have not. The Commerce Department estimates that the average effective mortgage rate in the third quarter of this year was 10.1 percent, only a bit lower than 10.2 percent in late 1990. And because mortgage debt has risen, the Goverment estimates that America's collective mortgage interest bill is rising fast enough to offset declines in other interest payments.
 
Potential Help for Recovery
 In 1980, before the 1981-82 recession, Americans received $1.39 in interest income for every dollar they paid in interest. By 1982, at the bottom of the economic cycle, that figure had risen to $1.67. That boost helped to get the economy started again. There was a similar, although less explosive, rise during the mid-1970's slump.
But during the 1980's Americans took on more and more debt, and by 1988 the figure was down to $1.17. It climbed to $1.28 last year, but this year appears to have dipped a bit, largely because interest rates on savings have fallen so rapidly. That means that as incomes from jobs have fallen during the recession, there has been less interest income to make up the slack.
There is no mystery why some rates have fallen more rapidly than others. The banking system, suffering from a hangover brought on by bad loans in the 1980's, needs higher profits. "Banks are dealing with serious balance-sheet problems," said Stephen S. Roach, an economist at Morgan Stanley & Company. "They can't pass it through to their best customers, so they are passing it to you and me."
 
Bailing Out the Banks
 In fact, all bank borrowers are paying part of the cost of helping banks cope with their problems. On Friday, many big banks cut their prime lending rates to 6 1/2 percent. Even at that level, the prime rate is 3 points above the discount rate, at which the Federal Reserve lends money to banks. By contrast, when the Federal Reserve cut the discount rate to 4 1/2 percent in late 1971, the prime rate was reduced to 5 1/4 percent, only three-quarters of a point higher. The result is that business borrowers are paying far more now than they were then, a fact that may be dampening growth.
Another factor holding down growth is that long-term rates have not fallen nearly as far as short-term ones. Mr. Greenspan attributes that tendency to a continuing fear of long-term inflation and has cited it as a cautionary sign against large tax cuts that could rapidly increase the deficit. Twenty years ago, when the discount rate was 4 1/2 percent, the yield on long-term Treasury bonds was 4.98 percent. Now the yield on 30-year Treasuries is 7.57 percent. Thus the benefits of a lower discount rate are not being fully realized by corporations that issue bonds to finance new plants.
 
Less Credit for Some
 Moreover, there has been a fundamental change in the availability of credit in the last two years, with the creation of a two-tier system. The top tier, which includes many people and the most financially secure companies, is able to borrow at ever-lower rates and can borrow large sums. But those not deemed to be part of the most credit-worthy group can find it extremely difficult to borrow at all. In 1991, it appears that records were set both for the issuance of corporate bonds, as quality companies refinanced their debt to save money, and for defaults on existing bonds, as companies facing financial problems were unable to find lenders.
Unfortunately for the prospects of immediate recovery, many who have access to capital are reluctant to use it. "People don't want to borrow because they have too much debt already," said Nancy Lazar, an economist with International Strategy & Investment Group in New York. And Ed Yardeni, the chief economist of C. J. Lawrence, notes, "Businesses do not respond to lower rates as much as they do to better sales." He believes that fiscal stimulus, through a tax cut, is still needed.
 
Homeowners' Predicament
 The tighter credit standards have also hurt some homeowners who seek to refinance their mortgages to take advantage of lower rates. To do so they need to get new appraisals of their homes, and to again get their incomes approved. If the appraisals show the homes are no longer worth the amount of the mortgage, or if the borrowers' incomes have fallen, it may be impossible to refinance the loans.
Many consumers have no doubt been hesitant to spend because of rising layoffs, which have caused consumer confidence to plunge. "You have re structurings going on in manufacturing and spreading to service industries," said Mr. Roach of Morgan Stanley. "That fear is now hurting a whole new part of America, the people wearing the white collars as well as the blue collars."
Still, if that fear wanes, and if the lower interest rates endure, they could be ushering in a period of growth for the American economy. "Huge interest savings will occur," said Lawrence Kudlow, the chief economist of Bear, Stearns & Company. "The whole cost structure will be lowered for American business, making it more competitive." And those savings, he said, will help the economy recover from the excesses of the 1980's.

HEADLINE: THE END OF THE SOVIET UNION;
Hard Realism Wins the Day

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 21

 BODY:
The formation of the commonwealth on the still-warm corpse of the union was hardly a pretty process. But after six years of illusions and false starts, it had a certain crude realism to it.
It began with what was basically a power play by the leaders of the three Slavic republics, who met in a Byelorussian wood on Dec. 8 and devised a plan to overthrow the old union and declare a new league around themselves. 
 With roughly three-quarters of the former union's land and wealth, the Slavic leaders presented the sketchy scheme on a take-it-or-leave-it basis to other republics and began pulling the rug out from under the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
When the other republics came on board today in Alma-Ata, Kazakhstan, the agreements were in the same rough vein. The critical issue of the army and its nuclear arsenal was left unresolved, the exact authority of the new coordinating structures was not defined, the constitutional legality of the agreements was left moot, economic reforms were not spelled out -- and even then the agreements were declared open to revision.
The haste and crudeness of the process were underscored by the fact that it was hard to glean a ringing historic quote in the vein of the American Declaration of Independence from any of the documents adopted by the 11 republic leaders, all of them former Communist officials now espousing democracy and national causes.
 
Unlike Previous Efforts
 Yet that very roughness and ruthlessness imbued the new commonwealth with a harsh realism and directness that set it apart from all the previous failed efforts to find a formula for a new association among the republics.
From the time Eduard A. Shevardnadze resigned as Foreign Minister a year ago, warning of an impending coup, efforts to stem the drift of the republics were all doomed.
First Mr. Gorbachev tried raw force, sending troops into the Baltics and even into Moscow. Then he shifted to the "9 plus 1" process of forging a new union treaty, but as long as the Communist Party and its vast instruments of power were functioning, they resisted, in the end trying the desperate coup in August.
After the coup failed, Mr. Gorbachev at first seemed to recognize that the drive for sovereignty among the republics was real. Yet stripped of his party and much of his power, the President himself became the final obstacle.
Whatever he was told, whatever he was shown, he continued to insist that the center had to survive, that without it the Soviet Union would become another blood-soaked Yugoslavia. No matter that the problem in Yugoslavia was precisely in trying to maintain an artificial union; Mr. Gorbachev repeatedly and insistently fought to keep his center intact.
 
Roles of Russia and Ukraine
 Whether it was Ukraine's nationalism or Russia's ambition that broke the chain is for historians to decide. Probably both. By November, Ukraine made it clear that it would not take part in anything that smacked of the old center, and Russia moved to annex the ministries, properties and powers of the central Government.
There was another problem, too. The collapse of the center had set loose 12 widely disparate republics, each with inexperienced new leaders coping with heaps of domestic problems and struggling to consolidate fragile powers, each with its own ambitions and fears.
Against this background, the decision of the three Slavic leaders to unilaterally declare a new course had a crude logic. Multilateral negotiations were fruitless, the center was discredited, something had to be done fast, and only the Slavic republics could do it.
In effect, the only answer was to go back to the beginnings, to start with the nations that founded the Soviet Union and to see if they could found something more promising, with more sovereignty for the republics and less chance for a dominating center to grow.
 
Positives vs. Negatives
 Nobody could say for certain what chances the commonwealth had.
On the positive side, it resolved the basic conflict between regional ambitions and the need for coordination. It also gave the republics a new chance to start critically needed reforms, and it offered them an acceptable framework within which to cooperate and coordinate.
On the other end of the scale, there was the danger that the centrifugal forces had already thrown the republics too far apart for any cooperation, and that the new commonwealth would suffer the fate of all its predecessors.
There was no telling what would happen to the agreements once they were put before local parliaments. Already the Ukrainian Parliament issued a statement reserving the right to back out and stubbornly insisting that it will have its own army and currency. Russia's ruthless takeover of all former government and Communist parties was likewise assuming an unseemly haste, irritating other republics and laying the foundation for future disputes.
The new leaders are imperfect, their methods are clumsy, their commonwealth is shaky, their act lacks class. But perhaps it could not have happened any other way: the old order had to die before a new one could rise.

HEADLINE: Japan Irked as Bush Visit Turns Into a Trade Quest

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 21

 BODY:
Japanese leaders are reacting with anger and dismay to President Bush's decision to travel here next month with an entourage of executives from the American automobile and other industries to increase pressure on Tokyo to open up its markets to American exports.
Senior Japanese officials say they do not see any possibility of significant concessions on automobile imports, and fear is rising in Japan that the visit could end up deepening mistrust and recriminations between Americans and the Japanese instead of easing tensions as it is supposed to do. 
 Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa has responded cautiously to Mr. Bush's promise to "relentlessly pursue our mission to create jobs and restore prosperity" on the visit to Japan. The Prime Minister said Friday at a news conference that Japan must "concede where it should" in the trade area, but that it must also stand up to the United States when it feels that problems are the result of American policies.
"Economic issues are growing severe," Mr. Miyazawa said, trying to show some sympathy for Mr. Bush's political problems. "But happily we are able to speak frankly and avoid misunderstandings. Even if we engage in debate, the outcome won't be war."
The increasing chill in the atmosphere surrounding the President's visit, which is scheduled for Jan. 7-10, testifies to the difficulty of relations between the two economic superpowers these days and to the political constraints faced by Mr. Bush and Mr. Miyazawa.
The visit was originally scheduled for earlier this month to coincide with the 50th anniversary of Pearl Harbor, as a gesture of reassurance by the United States that Washington and Tokyo have forged a new "global partnership" out of the ashes of war.
But Mr. Bush canceled the original visit to turn his attention to growing domestic problems. Meanwhile, the various plans that Japan had hoped to showcase on the visit have gone down in flames in Parliament.
The main disappointment was the dooming of the Government's hope for legislative approval of a measure to have Japanese troops take part in United Nations peacekeeping forces. This week, Mr. Miyazawa saw the collapse of a separate plan, a tax to finance foreign aid.
Japanese diplomats concede that no big new proposal exists to demonstrate Tokyo's readiness to play a global role commensurate with its economic status. Their hope had been to counter Washington's disappointment that Tokyo has done nothing more than write $13 billion in checks to support the American-led war against Iraq.
 
Premier's Base Weakens
 Mr. Miyazawa's political base has weakened in recent weeks because of his own problems, including a budget deficit that has forced him to raise taxes in an election year. He may also have trouble delivering money to support a supercollider project in Texas, another demand tied to the Bush trip.
Nor does the Government appear ready to make any significant concessions to open up its markets to imported rice, another step demanded by the White House as a way of revitalizing the moribund international trade negotiations known as the Uruguay round.
The prevailing view in Japan is that the United States has not taken its share of steps to increase the competitiveness and quality of its products, particularly in the automobile industry. The pressure on Japan to import American auto parts is widely viewed here as infuriating.
Asahi Shimbun, Japan's leading newspaper, said today in an editorial that Mr. Bush seemed to be waging "gunboat diplomacy in economic areas" and that he should ask American car manufacturers to learn a lesson from Western Europeans, who are more successful in selling automobiles in Japan.
"Why do European cars sell better in the Japanese market than U.S. ones?" the newspaper asked. "American manufacturers should be more aware of the basics of business, which require producers to make goods catering to the tastes of consumers."
A senior Japanese diplomat said he sympathized with Americans who feel anxiety in witnessing the collapse of their car industry, but added, "Personally, I have no sympathy for American automobile manufacturers."
As depicted in the Japanese press, the American car makers have done little to showcase their products here, tailor them to Japanese tastes or forge relationships with retailers, whereas European manufacturers have done all those things.
But since automobiles count for perhaps three-quarters of the $41 billion trade imbalance between the United States and Japan, there have been steps by the big auto manufacturers in recent weeks to try to remedy the situation. Nissan, Toyota, Honda and others have announced that they will set new targets to import more American parts and to use more American parts in their automobile plants in the United States.
Government officials maintain that all these steps were done voluntarily, an assertion that few experts believe. Leaders of the Japanese car industry said this weekend that they did not see any likelihood of further steps. And their criticism of the American automobile industry is seen as potentially embarrassing to the White House if it becomes more outspoken.
Even some American diplomats involved in the planning of Mr. Bush's trips admit that they were surprised by the White House's decision to turn the President's visit into an exercise in trying to sell automobile parts.
A prominent president of a major bank in Japan, asking not to be identified, ridiculed Mr. Bush. "I would have thought after your great victory in the gulf, your President would feel confident enough to leave trade issues to his subordinates," he said.

HEADLINE: U.S. REVIEWS FOCUS OF SECURITY DATA

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 21

 BODY:
In an order to policy makers, President Bush says he envisions a reshaping of the nation's intelligence-gathering functions to include a greater focus on shortages of natural resources, global health problems and other issues that have not previously been considered central to insuring national security.
In the order, known as a National Security Directive, the President does not suggest dramatic cutbacks in the intelligence bureaucracy. Instead he proposes a remolding of its functions to adapt to new, more diffuse requests for data and analysis resulting from the collapse of the Soviet Union, while still meeting the needs of American military security. 
 Robert M. Gates, the Director of Central Intelligence, briefly discussed the Presidential order in a speech on Dec. 4, calling it "the most far-reaching directive to assess future intelligence priorities and needs since 1947." But the text of the order, obtained by The New York Times, offers much more detail on the role of intelligence envisioned by Mr. Bush in the next decade-and-a-half.
 
Re-examining Priorities
 "We are in transition from watching Soviet operational readiness to wondering about the control of Soviet nuclear weapons," the order, dated Nov. 15, says. "The Soviet Union and Eastern Europe have been transformed, the Warsaw Pact dissolved and Soviet activism (especially in the Third World) dramatically curtailed. There is growing interest here at home in our intelligence services tackling new issues and problems.
"Together, these developments urgently require a top to bottom examination of the mission, role and priorities of the intelligence community."
Unless choices are made and priorities are set, the document warned, "our capabilities will spread too thin to satisfy even the highest priorities and our inability to plan and invest long-term will leave us with inadequate intelligence assets to protect our vital interests and our security."
The order has been sent to 20 agencies and departments of the Government. Some, like the State, Defense and Treasury departments, have in-house intelligence bureaus, while several others are nontraditional users of intelligence, like the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Health and Human Services and NASA.
 
Bypassing Intelligence Officials
 In a clear indication that Mr. Bush is looking for an entirely new approach, the order states that in the first phase of the review, policy makers will draft lists of their anticipated needs and that intelligence bureaus "should not be involved." The order faults senior policy makers for having traditionally "neglected their critical role in setting intelligence priorities and requirements."
"You need people who have no equity in the current system," said one Administration official involved in the review process. "One can argue that intelligence people are looking to preserve their current roles."
The directive raises questions about new global problems in which American intelligence may need to become more involved.
"Will we need more and different intelligence information on international aspects of the environment, natural resource scarcities (such as water), global health problems, international research and development efforts, and so on?" the order asked. "What kinds of economic intelligence do we need?"
At the same time, the order asks agencies whether they can do without. "What information are you receiving now that you will not need at all or where you can accept far less detailed knowledge?"
The review will be comprehensive but will be conducted very quickly, a task that Mr. Gates referred to in his speech as "a monumental undertaking."
The bureaus and agencies will respond to the directive by mid-January, and a report will be submitted to the National Security Council for review a month later.
Once the council approves a plan, Mr. Gates will make his own recommendations for structural changes, budgets and possible new legislation, and present them to the National Security Council by March 20.

HEADLINE: Foreign Millionaires in No Rush to Apply for Visas, U.S. Finds

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 21

 BODY:
The United States put its new "millionaire visas" on the market this month, offering American citizenships to big-time investors. But it discovered that among the world's rich, there are not many takers.
After months of preparation and publicity, the Government has just issued its final regulations for the special visas, which offer permanent residency status to foreigners who invest $1 million or more in a business that employs at least 10 people. 
 After almost three weeks, only 177 potential investors, much fewer than the Government initially expected, have applied for the 10,000 visas, which are the first step toward citizenship.
This hesitancy by foreign millionaires contrasts with the avalanche of nearly 19 million applications that the Government received two months ago in a first-come, first-served lottery that offered 40,000 visas to people from 34 selected nations.
Immigration lawyers say a host of fine points contributes to the reticence of rich foreigners, who can easily find other ways to stay in this country. But these difficulties are only a part of a larger debate about the program, which was created last year under a new immigration law.
Critics of the visa program say the nation is abandoning its historic ideals on immigration, which have traditionally held open America's doors to the tired, the poor and the oppressed. They say that for the first time, sheer wealth is a criterion for citizenship.
"The new concept is, 'What is in it for the United States?' " said Arthur C. Helton, an immigration specialist with the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights. "This is a matter of concern in that it may signal a turning away from more traditional humanitarian bases, including family unification and protecting refugees from persecution."
But the visas are drawing praise from others who say that at last America is putting its national interests ahead of sentiment and seeking new citizens who can invigorate the economy.
"I believe we've done a great job with boat people, and I think that a few yacht people are not going to hurt America," said Harold W. Ezell, a former regional commissioner for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, who is now a middleman for potential millionaire visa applicants. "They're going to be good for America in creating jobs and investment."
The 1990 immigration act took a similarly pragmatic approach in nearly tripling the number of permanent residency visas offered to people with special job skills, to 140,000 a year. The shift was seen as a move to compete with other nations for the world's most accomplished people, including its wealthy entrepreneurs.
The bulk of the nearly 700,000 immigrant visas authorized by law each year will continue to be issued following traditional criteria, primarily for family reunification.
 
Competing for the Rich
 The investor-visa program, which offers 10,000 residencies a year, puts America in a competition with Canada and Australia to lure wealthy investors. In Canada, for example, thousands of foreigners, particularly Asians, have won residency over the last four years by investing in or starting businesses.
But a number of factors make the American offer less attractive than those of its competitors: It demands a higher investment, it requires the hiring of a fixed number of employees and it calls for a audit in two years to assure that the investment and the employees are still in place.
Immigration lawyers also say a number of potential investors have been frightened off because citizenship will mean they must pay United States taxes on all their earnings worldwide.
"It's certainly not as user-friendly as the Canadian or Australian models," said H. Ronald Klasko, an immigration lawyer who recently traveled in Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan to gauge interest in the visas.
For wealthy investors, the symbolism of the American flag apparently carries less weight than the dynamics of the marketplace.
"I was a little bit surprised at the lack of raging anxiety for the immigrant investor category," said Mr. Klasko. Many people in Hong Kong, a target of the program because of the impending takeover by China in 1997, showed interest in investing in the United States, he said, but expressed worry about the complications and the tax obligations involved in getting a green card.
An immigration lawyer who has talked with potential European investors, Palma R. Yanni, said: "I don't think people are going to plop down $1 million for a green card and say, 'This is all I want.' Sophisticated investors are going to want a real return on their money."
 
Another Option
 For such people, there is already a mechanism in place, the E-visa that allows a non-immigrant investor to live in the United States as long as he runs a business in this country. All that is missing is the chance to become an American citizen.
"That's the traditional form of investor visa, the one that's been around for years," said Charles Powell, a business lawyer who is advising a number of potential immigrant investors. This visa requires a smaller investment, often in such businesses as laundries or restaurants, and does not stipulate the creation of jobs.
"I sent a flier to people who I knew had $1 million and were already here on E-visas," said Mr. Powell. "I said, 'Here's your opportunity to get a green card,' and I got very little response. I was very surprised at that. I thought I'd at least get one or two people who would actually go through the process, but I didn't."
Among the drawbacks, lawyers said, was an employment requirement that their clients found unrealistic.
"The law has a basic flaw built into it," said Martin Lawler, a lawyer who advises potential investors to start out slowly with an E-visa. "It requires 10 employees for $1 million, when generally speaking, business attorneys tell me, it takes at least $1.5 million to $2 million to carry 10 people."
Another drawback is the requirement for a government review after two years, a hurdle that effectively makes the initial $1 million investment a high-stakes gamble.
Although immigration lawyers and middlemen like Mr. Ezell say they have had inquiries from entrepreneurs in several nations, the common theme seemed to be caution, and none of their clients agreed to be interviewed.
Among the potential investors is a Taiwanese woman who is looking at opportunities at a marble factory and a seafood import business, a German rock music promoter who wants to put down roots here, an Iranian family hoping to transfer its construction business and a Japanese woman seeking to invest $1.3 million in a foundry.
Mr. Ezell's clients include a Taiwanese couple living in Beverly Hills on an E-visa who have already invested more than $1 million in a preschool that employs about 10 people.
"They have made a major commitment to America," Mr. Ezell said. "This business of theirs is over a million bucks, and they have spent $4 million on their home in Beverly Hills. They want their son to be raised here and educated here, and this is the way they want to do it."

HEADLINE: How Final Curtain Fell on a 10-Week Melodrama

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Dec. 21

 BODY:
The melodrama that ended on Friday at the Capitol, where a grim Mario M. Cuomo declared that he was taking himself out of the Presidential race, began exactly 10 weeks earlier, at a breakfast meeting of 150 of his financial supporters at the Regency Hotel in Manhattan.
After months of issuing a standard refrain, that he had "no plans and no plans to make plans" to run, Mr. Cuomo told his friends that he had at last concluded that he would "think about" a campaign for President. 
 "It literally sent a ripple through the room," said one person who was there. "Everybody was turning their heads at each other, and you could see people whispering, 'Did you hear that?' "
Mr. Cuomo prefaced and followed his comment with a warning that the state's budget problems were even more severe than the public perceived. He implied that without a solution, he could not run.
 
Looking Out at '92 From the Edge
 And it was the budget morass that Mr. Cuomo depicted on Friday as the lone obstacle to a campaign.
In the hours before his announcement, Mr. Cuomo called several close advisers from his study in the Executive Mansion and read to them from two statements that he kept revising with his pen even as he spoke.
One was a declaration that he would seek the Democratic nomination and included a defiant assertion that Presidential politics from the Republicans who had blocked a budget deal would not keep Mr. Cuomo out of the race. That statement will presumably remain consigned to his desk.
"He was agonizing about it, he really was, right up until the end," said Vincent A. Tese, State Economic Development Director and one of Mr. Cuomo's closest advisers. After Mr. Cuomo called around 2 P.M. and said he was out of the race, Mr. Tese added, "I could hardly hear his voice on the telephone."
The image of Mr. Cuomo's putting his sense of duty to his sworn oath above his desire to run is a compelling one, especially because he had had expressed enthusiasm to aides that national polls showed him within striking distance of President Bush. But it also shows that his decision making always included the option, perhaps inevitable, that he would not run. For perhaps more than any other state official, Mr. Cuomo knows the recent history of rancor and lateness that mark budget making here.
The issue that may never be fully resolved is whether Mr. Cuomo genuinely thought he could hammer out an early deal with the Republicans to attack the state's fiscal ills. That would have stood in stark and welcome contrast to all recent history of budget making here. Given that history, it is clear that his path to the Presidency always included a detour, a way that he could stand at the very edge of a formal campaign and then turn back. And that is what he did.
 
The Heart, the Head And the Budget
 After the breakfast in October a process of public introspection unique in the annals of American politics began, as Mr. Cuomo's debate with himself eclipsed the attention commanded by the other candidates already in the race and kept the Democratic Party in suspense until the final few minutes before his announcement.
"What does my heart tell me?" he asked himself in late October on a cable-television program on Long Island. " 'Go out and tell them, Mario. Take your best shot, whether you win, lose or draw.' "
But, Mr. Cuomo quickly added, he was still "working on my head," which was focused on the budget. By that time, he had announced a $700 million gap in the state's current $30 billion budget -- it has since grown by $200 million -- and an even more severe problem in the next spending plan.
"Let's be realistic," he told a call-in radio program on Nov. 14. "How can you deal with the Presidency if you've got a $700 million hole?"
 
Overshadowing The Message
 The people who talked to Mr. Cuomo about the Presidency in October and last month said that his attitudes on running soared and fell almost solely on the status of the budget talks. He rationalized that the Republicans would go along with his proposal for a 15-month budget because such a plan was more in their interest than yet another patchwork solution to the immediate deficit, which would guarantee another bloody fight and harsh cuts in the spring and summer, when they would be preparing for re-election campaigns.
Mr. Cuomo complained to reporters that the accounts of his indecision were misplaced. "You don't make a decision until you have all the facts," he said over and over. He also complained that the accounts obscured his speeches and policy statements about reviving the economy through a net investment-tax credit for machinery and pollution control and infusion of cash into the Federal Reserve system for banks to loan to businesses.
 
Hamstrung By Problems
 As the weeks wore on, Mr. Cuomo appeared to be giving conflicting accounts of his conditions for candidacy. One day he said that without a solution to the budget, he could not run. A few days later he said that he did not need to resolve the problems, that he just had to be sure that "my running for President won't make it more difficult, won't make it worse for the state."
Early this week he said that even without a budget accord he might run, if he concluded that the Republicans were purposely obstructing a pact to keep him from the race.
"They would no longer have the motive to slow you up," he said. "And that would save the state, by running for President."
But in private conversations he consistently conceded that he could not envision running, unless he could argue plausibly that he was controlling the state's fiscal problems.
 
Burning the Wires To Concord, N.H.
 J. Joseph Grandmaison, a former chairman of the New Hampshire Democratic Party, received his first call from an adviser to Mr. Cuomo, John Marino, shortly after Thanksgiving. Mr. Marino told Mr. Grandmaison that he was calling at the Governor's request and that he was trying to gather as much information as possible about the New Hampshire primary.
"He did not ask for support," Mr. Grandmaison said. "He just asked me to help him as a friend."
Over the next two weeks, Mr. Grandmaison and Mr. Marino spoke several times on the phone. Mr. Marino was always careful to speak of the Governor's candidacy in the subjunctive. "At no point did John say anything but 'if,' " Mr. Grandmaison recalled.
As the filing deadline drew nearer, the questions from the Cuomo camp grew more practical, like how the other Democratic candidates were doing in New Hampshire.
"I went out of my way to say the other candidates were doing well," Mr. Grandmaison said. "I told them they should recognize that the other candidates had been on the ground, building organizations."
On Dec. 13, Mr. Grandmaison suggested that with a week before the deadline, the filing details should be considered and an application for the primary ballot should be obtained. Mr. Marino wanted to know whether that could be accomplished discreetly. Mr. Grandmaison told him that it could not.
It was then decided that Mr. Grandmaison would pick up a primary form on Monday in Concord and send it by overnight mail to Mr. Marino in New York City and that the press in Albany would be alerted. If the Governor decided to file, he was supposed to do so on Thursday or Friday.
On Tuesday, Mr. Grandmaison started to worry. Mr. Cuomo might arrive in New Hampshire in 48 hours, trailing dozens of reporters, and none of the details of his arrival like buses, lights and sound systems had been tended to.
That evening Mr. Grandmaison met in his house in Rye, N.H., with a half-dozen Cuomo supporters to plan for the Governor's appearance. The next day, they reserved buses for Thursday or Friday and alerted a sound technician for both days. They also scouted around Manchester for a campaign headquarters and solicited bids for office furniture.
Also on Wednesday, Mr. Marino finally asked Mr. Grandmaison for a tentative schedule of the tentative events in New Hampshire, so he could fax it to Mr. Cuomo in Albany. That was the first time, Mr. Grandmaison said, that he sensed any involvement by Mr. Cuomo in the preparations.
By Thursday morning, no word had come from Mr. Cuomo. At that point a legal problem developed. According to some interpretations of the New Hampshire election law, a candidate who does not deliver a primary application in person has to have it delivered the day before the deadline. That, some of Mr. Cuomo's advisers said, meant that he had until only Thursday afternoon to mail his application.
At midday, an aide to Mr. Marino was dispatched to Concord with the Governor's signed ballot application and a certified check for the $1,000 filing fee. At 3 P.M., Mr. Grandmaison met the aide at the airport in Concord, put the application in the trunk of his car and drove downtown to await a decision on whether or not he should hand it to the Secretary of State. That afternoon, Mr. Grandmaison recalled, "I remember John's saying he was the most optimistic he had been" that Mr. Cuomo would run.
At 4:45 he placed a last call to Mr. Marino. No decision had been made. The application was not filed.
It seemed clear that if Mr. Cuomo was going to file, he was going to have to go to New Hampshire, for legal and political reasons. On Thursday night, an advance team was dispatched from Albany and New York City to Concord. In Albany, a long and inconclusive meeting between the Governor and the legislative leaders broke up with no budget agreement in sight.
Friday dawned with still no signal from Mr. Cuomo. At the Albany airport, the two chartered planes, costing $30,000, waited to take Mr. Cuomo and an entourage of reporters to Manchester, N.H. By 7 A.M. reporters began clogging the halls of the Capitol.
By midmorning the hallway outside the Governor's office in Albany began to resemble a crowded subway platform, with reporters and camera crews' milling around wearily. Top aides still did not know whether Mr. Cuomo was going to run or when or where he would announce his decision.
Mr. Cuomo spent the morning at the Executive Mansion. He called the State Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, no relation to John, and continued to press for a budget settlement, but neither side put forth new proposals.
Mr. Cuomo also called several friends and advisers to read them the differing versions of his announcement. They could hear his pen's scratching across the pad as he revised his remarks.
"I said, 'Don't make too many handwritten corrections, because one day, this might be auctioned at Sotheby's,' " a spokesman for the Economic Development Department, Harold Holzer, said.
At 1 P.M., Mr. Grandmaison decided that there was no longer time to have Mr. Cuomo fly to Manchester and drive to Concord to file. The flight plan was changed, so that the planes would fly directly to Concord. About 2 o'clock Mr. Cuomo called several close advisers and told them that he was not running. At about that time, the crowd in Concord, which had grown to include scores of reporters, began to note that there probably was not even enough time for the Governor to fly from Albany for the 5 P.M. deadline.
"At 2, without anybody's saying anything, you realized the likelihood had become substantially reduced," Mr. Grandmaison recounted.
That a decision had finally been reached -- though not what decision -- became apparent to reporters at about 3:15, when a news conference was called. Mr. Grandmaison, calling from a pay phone, had received word that the Mr. Cuomo was not running. At 3:30, 90 minutes before the deadline, Mr. Cuomo faced the press in Albany, and Mr. Grandmaison delivered the news to reporters in Concord.
"He decided fully when the budget was fully decided," Mr. Cuomo's son Andrew said. "From day 1 he said, 'I needed a budget.' "

HEADLINE: The Cocaine War's Biggest Success: a Fungus

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru

 BODY:
In the war on cocaine, a humble root fungus is having a greater impact on Peru's coca leaf harvest than the will of Washington.
Leaving a trail of wilted bushes in its path, the fungus, a strain of fusarium oxysporum, has devastated about 10 percent -- or 15,000 acres -- of the coca fields in the Upper Huallaga Valley over the last two years. Bushes in the valley provide leaves for about half the world's cocaine production. 
 By contrast, an American-supported manual eradication effort was quietly ended in the valley in July in face of armed opposition by guerrillas and lack of interest by Peru's Government.
Coca growers charge that the United States is spreading the fungus with helicopters based in Santa Lucia, an American-built base in the Huallaga. American officials say the fungus is endemic to the Huallaga and is spreading naturally because of single crop cultivation.
"Eradication as a policy of the Peruvian Government does not exist and will not exist in the near future," said a Western drug expert here.
In an economy where living standards are at 1965 levels, Peruvian military officers frequently bribe their superiors in Lima for the privilege of transfers to the Huallaga Valley. Landing fees charged pilots of drug planes taking off for Colombia range from $1,500 to $5,000.
Military coordination has recently improved as the United States has pushed to turn Santa Lucia into a national center for antidrug operations.
Since operations began at Santa Lucia last year, the helicopters' fuel capacities limited operations to a 100-mile radius from the base. But in a coordinated operation last month, American and Peruvian pilots ferried Peruvian troops and antidrug police to Palma Pampas, a major trafficking center 400 miles southeast of Santa Lucia, where the police seized radios, ledgers, generators, laboratory chemicals and 372 pounds of cocaine base.
This month, Peru's Air Force is taking possession of 10 new Brazilian-made Tucano aircraft, which are suitable for intercepting small planes. But one year after an intercept campaign was begun, the air force has made few seizures from an air bridge that links Peruvian growers in the Huallaga and cocaine chemists in Colombia.
"We need a radar system for alerts, but there is no money in the national budget," Peru's new Prime Minister, Alfonso de los Heros, said in a recent interview here.
Acting on American-supplied radar intelligence, Peruvian air force planes forced down a trafficker's plane on Dec. 2, seizing 1,200 pounds of cocaine base. On Dec. 7, air force planes intercepted two planes flying south from Colombia. One crashed into the jungle, and the other reportedly turned back to Colombia.
A plan to wean growers from coca to alternative crops like corn, rice and bananas appears to have had success only in areas where fungus and high labor costs have cut profit margins. In the Huallaga, for example, growers have seen the profit on a kilo of coca leaves shrink from $1.50 to 10 cents in two years.
But as some farmers move to legitimate crops, other coca cultivators are pushing the agricultural frontier into Peru's Amazon lowlands.
"Coca keeps expanding," said one international agricultural expert who works to promote alternative crops in Peru. "We could spend $1 billion to turn around the Upper Huallaga, and then two years later there would be a new Upper Huallaga somewhere else."
With Peru's countryside in crisis because of guerrilla turmoil, coca cultivation now supports an estimated 1 million people out of a national population of more than 22 million.
Aiming to overthrow Peru's civilian government, guerrillas of the Shining Path movement disrupt food production, but protect coca leaf growers. In return for "war taxes," the group negotiates higher producer prices from Colombian buyers, settles disputes among growers and provides protection from the police.
"Where coca goes, Sendero goes," the international expert said, using the group's Spanish name. "They are principally in the jungle for economic reasons -- to get arms and money."

HEADLINE: Political Talk

BYLINE: By Sam Howe Verhovek

 BODY:

 
Lining Up Endorsements
 Even before Gov. Mario M. Cuomo had taken himself out of the Presidential race, other Democratic candidates were preparing their assaults on New York for the primary here next April.
On Dec. 10 Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas held a fund-raiser at the Waldorf-Astoria in Manhattan that pulled in more than $250,000, said Governor Clinton's director of finance in the Northeast, Paul R. Carey, who is the son of former Gov. Hugh Carey, under whom Mr. Cuomo served as Lieutenant Governor. The elder Mr. Carey attended the fund-raiser even though he has not officially endorsed anyone in the race, his son said. 
 And last week, just days before Mr. Cuomo's announcement, the Clinton campaign lined up an endorsement from Joseph E. McDermott, the president of the Civil Service Employees Association, the largest union of state workers in New York. State employees, whose salaries have been frozen for more than a year, are locked in a bitter struggle with Mr. Cuomo over salaries.
Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, meanwhile, announced the opening of his New York campaign office last week, declaring, "We plan to wage an all-out campaign here and will run to win."
And now that Mr. Cuomo is a non-candidate, several of these candidates have begun calling his supporters for help; for instance, within an hour of the Governor's announcement Friday, Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska was on the phone with Assembly Speaker Saul Weprin, who said publicly that he was still hoping Mr. Cuomo would somehow get back into the race.
"Now New York becomes much more interesting," Paul Carey, the Clinton aide, said. "There's certainly more potential here than there was 24 hours ago, especially for fund-raising."
 
Cuomo Fever Spreads
 As one politician decides, another begins to ponder. While Mr. Cuomo was capturing headlines with his political ruminations, a familiar name in New Jersey was nourishing a different kind of will-he, won't-he speculation.
Brian M. Hughes, the 35-year-old son of former Gov. Richard J. Hughes, last week announced formation of a campaign advisory committee to explore his candidacy for Congress in 1992.
The younger Mr. Hughes is an assistant to the executive director of the Governor's Council on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse, a $23,000-a-year job that, his press statement was quick to point out, is not a political appointment.
If he decides to challenge the Republican incumbent, Christopher Smith, it would Mr. Hughes's first try for political office. A decision on his candidacy is months away, but Mr. Hughes, a Democrat, already has the oratory of a candidate.
"The incumbent, Chris Smith, clearly is out of touch with the day-to-day economic needs and worries of real people here in New Jersey," Mr. Hughes said in his statement. "After nearly 11 years in Congress, he's as insensitive to those needs and worries as are the rest of the Republicans in Washington."
Mr. Smith could not be reached for comment on his potential challenger.
 
The Death of Town Hall?
 If you think it's hard to keep up with the dissolution of the Soviet Union, consider this:
Change-NY, a conservative anti-tax group, has proposed that local governments in New York be disbanded. No more Carthage, N.Y. No more Corinth, N.Y. No more Naples, N.Y. The only exception would be large municipalities like New York City.
Change-NY is financed by some of the state's most vocal conservatives, including Lewis Lehrman, the Republican candidate for Governor in 1982, and Herbert London, the Conservative Party gubernatorial candidate in 1990.
The point of the plan, simply put, is to save money. Services provided by the local governments would be taken over by counties. The group estimates that the state would save $441 million this way and that local taxpayers would save $3.1 billion. (But think of all the money schools would have to spend on new maps!)

HEADLINE: After Years of 'Potential,' Will Cuomo Star Still Shine?

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Dec. 21

 BODY:
From July 16, 1984, when he captivated the nation with his keynote address to the Democratic National Convention, until Dec. 20, 1991, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo enjoyed the elevated political status of the "potential Presidential candidate."
The presumption that Mr. Cuomo might someday reside in the White House has bolstered his approval ratings in New York, given him a broader forum for his views and helped him command speaking fees of up to $20,000. 
 "I don't mind you people speculating," Mr. Cuomo said of the press in an interview last year. "It's probably good for me."
Now that Mr. Cuomo has taken himself out of the 1992 Presidential race, that speculation should end, at least for a few years and perhaps forever. And the impact on the political future of a man regarded as one of the Democratic Party's brightest hopes could be significant, both within the recession-wracked state he must continue to govern and in the party whose nomination he declined to pursue.
Mr. Cuomo's longtime friends and aides said the Governor understood that the choice he announced on Friday and the drawn-out process leading up to it might tarnish the shine on his political legacy.
"The decision not to run was the harder of the decisions to make," said Meyer S. Frucher, a former aide who speaks to the Governor regularly. "Mario Cuomo knows there is no glory and certainly no relief in staying and slogging through the budget and economic issues of the state.
"The allocation of losses is always a politically damaging and heart-wrenching problem. There are never winners and he knows it. He knows that he sentenced himself to an agonizing process that virtually any politician in America would attempt to escape."
 
Freedom from Obligations
 That agonizing process continued today as Mr. Cuomo summoned legislative leaders to an afternoon budget meeting in his conference room. Less than 24 hours after a throng of reporters had camped out in front of Mr. Cuomo's office to learn whether he would seek the Presidency, the Governor was back to the mundane and painful business of cutting the state budget.
"Events of the last 24 hours or so have freed me up from some political obligations," he said. "I'm going to use that freedom I didn't anticipate to focus even harder on the budget and the State of the State and that's what I'll be doing in the forseeable future."
There were no signs today that the budget impasse that Mr. Cuomo blamed for blocking his candidacy would dissolve any time soon. And if it does, new gaps in the state budget and new rounds of partisan fighting with the Republicans who control the State Senate are bound to emerge.
Some lawmakers and legislative aides questioned whether Mr. Cuomo's decision to pass up a Presidential race would diminish his popularity in the state and weaken his influence in the Capitol. Some have suggested that the Governor could essentially become a lame duck going into the second year of his third four-year term.
 
Control Already Gone
 But in actuality, it has been several years since Mr. Cuomo exerted significant control over even the Assembly, the Democratic house in the Legislature. Earlier this year, for example, the former Assembly Speaker, Mel Miller, proposed a major increase in the income tax that had been rejected by Mr. Cuomo.
Lee M. Miringoff, a poll taker who has measured Mr. Cuomo's popularity in his nine years in office, said there was less connection now between Mr. Cuomo's national aspirations and his statewide political power than there might have been four years ago, before the recession and four consecutive years of budget deficits had sapped the governor's popularity.
A statewide poll taken in October by the Marist Institute for Public Opinion, which Mr. Miringoff directs, showed that Mr. Cuomo's approval rating was at an all-time low of 44 percent. That was down from 75 percent in January 1988, when the economy was flush and Mr. Cuomo was still being mentioned as a potential candidate in that year's Presidential election.
"I think when the economy was good, his national aspirations fueled his popularity," Mr. Miringoff said. "I think his popularity now is more tied to the state of the recession in New York and the continuous bad budget news coming out of Albany."

HEADLINE: POLLUTION LIMITS DEBATED FOR CARS

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
State air pollution regulators and representatives of the automakers squared off for a debate Wednesday over whether New York should adopt California's tough standards on tailpipe pollution, and succeeded in making the audience, about 80 auto dealers, very nervous.
But perhaps because of heightened environmental consciousness among their customers and among the dealers themselves, the New York State Automobile Dealers Association has not taken a position on the rules. The reason, one dealer suggested, is that the people who sell cars do not trust either the Government or the auto manufacturers. 
 New York and 10 other states from Virginia to Maine have pledged to adopt the standards, which will require that, beginning in the mid-90's, cars emit far less carbon monoxide, a poison, and far less of the chemicals that cause smog. But the manufacturers, mounting a state-by-state resistance campaign, flew a team from Detroit to urge the dealers to oppose the rules.
"You will all remember 1981," said Al Weverstad, General Motors' manager of emission compliance, referring to the year when Federal regulations required yards of extra vacuum tubing in every car, creating balky engines that caused what Detroit calls "driveability problems."
 
Warning of Price Increases
 "Every time you force the technology, you take that risk," he said, arguing that if the new rules are adopted prices will rise by $1,000 a car, performance will drop and consumers will simply stop buying. Mr. Weverstad said that everything from baking bread to pumping gasoline to using hair spray adds chemicals to the air.
But Thomas Allen, director of the Division of Air Resources of the Department of Environmental Conservation, said the automobile industry was being told to spend only a modest amount, per ton of pollutant removed, compared to what factories and other polluters were being ordered to do.
"To point at everybody else's ox and say, 'gore that one, get the fuel guys, get the hair-spray guys,' is not fair," he said.
None of this cheered the dealers gathered at a Holiday Inn near La Guardia Airport. They are having a miserable year because of the recession, and are not anxious to take on anything that a customer will not love.
"Think of the last thing they tried to sell that didn't run on gasoline: diesels," said Henry Famularo, the service manager at Penn Toyota in Roslyn, L.I. Sitting next to him was Frank Apollo, service manager at Sunrise Toyota in Oakdale, L.I. "We have a few of those kicking around, very few," he said. "People thought they were buying a car like a gasoline car, only it's not." The diesels started differently, drove differently and had to be maintained differently, he said, and buyers disliked them.
 
Several Possible Changes
 Just what design changes the new rules would require is uncertain, but the cars available in a few years could include pre-heaters on catalytic converters that could make them slower to start, or incorporate more radical changes, like using natural gas or electricity instead of gasoline.
Despite their wariness of new technology, though, the dealers are not rushing to Detroit's defense. Mark Schienberg, executive vice president of the Greater New York Automobile Dealers Association, an affiliate of the statewide group, said that before condemning the California rules, the dealers were waiting to see that "this is not another air bag situation."
In that case, he said, the dealers enthusiastically backed Detroit's contention that air bags were impractical, too expensive and perhaps dangerous, until Chrysler Corporation abruptly switched positions and began using them as a selling point.
"Down the road, five years from now," he said, "I don't want Lee Iacocca riding around in a California car saying it's the best thing ever invented, and us getting another black eye."
 
A Selling Point?
 Jason Grumet, an assistant to Mr. Allen at the Department of Environmental Conservation, also referred to the air bag case. "My sense is that the one thing moving cars off your lots now is air bags," he said. He predicted that dealers could make a selling point of cleaner cars, too.
The dealers are clearly divided. "New York has had an air pollution program for 20 years, and I don't see any difference in the pollution," said Jim Farley, a Volkswagen dealer in New Hyde Park, L.I. "They haven't proved to me that they're able to solve the pollution."
Bob Bialer of Forest Hills Chevrolet criticized the system under which California passes rules that require inventions, but agrees to review the rules every two years and change them if the necessary technology has not been developed. That, he said, was like playing "chicken" by standing in front of oncoming cars and waiting for them to swerve.
Mark Herrmann of Mark Buick in Yonkers said that he was not eager to offer anything for sale that would reduce customer convenience, as seat belt interlocks did in the 1970's. And if new pollution standards led customers to defer their purchases because they did not like the new cars, that would hurt sales tax receipts as well as dealers' revenues.
But he added: "We do have a moral, social responsibility, not only to our children, but to our grandchildren. I don't know which way you should go."

ECONOMY
 
Earth to Washington: The Recession Continues
When Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, testified before Congress, last week he cautioned the House Ways and Means Comittee not to move hastily on a plan to cut taxes even though, he admitted, "the economy is struggling." Cutting taxes is a "quick fix," he said. He also said he may have underestimated the country's economic woes. The White House, with a new chief of staff, is worried about how the economy will affect President Bush's standing in the polls also changed its view about the economy. "The recession continues," it said reversing its view that a turnaround had occurred. On Friday, Mr. Greenspan put those new insights into action. The Federal Reserve pushed the discount rate, what the Fed charges banks for short-term loans, down a full percentage point to its lowest level in nearly 30 years -- 3.5 percent. There is nothing like a looming election to focus the mind.
 
Little Hope From a Lower Prime
If banks can borrow more cheaply from the Fed, the argument goes, they can charge their best customers less when they drop by for a loan. That should get the country going. Last week at least part of that scenario played out. The most aggressive banks in the country began cutting their prime rates. (Banks compete with each other to make loans, after all). The first to cut its prime was Morgan Guaranty Trust & Company, the nation's fourth largest bank. It cut a full percentage point, to 6.5 percent from 7.5 percent. But will cuts in the prime add enough snap to get the economy going? "Not in the near term," said Mickey Levy, chief economist at CRT Government Securities. "Monetary policy was already easy enough for an expansion." he said. The real problems, Mr. Levy said, have to do with debt-encumbered consumers and overbuilt real estate.
 
A Record Housing Bust
Buy a home and pretty soon you'll have to gussie it it up with everything from drapes to dishwashers. That's why economists say the housing industry is a leading indicator for the rest of the economy. But last week's numbers did not exactly presage a boom. According to the Commerce Department, housing starts fell by 2.1 percent in November. "We are now guaranteed the lowest annual total since World War II," said David F. Seiders, a housing industry economist.
 
Vox Populi or Else
Bedtime reading at the White House must be Lao-tse, the ancient Chinese philosopher who said the best way to lead a country is by following the voice of the people. In September, the White House declared the recession over. Then last week Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said "for all practical purposes the recession continues." The reason for the switch? "The people of this country know that the economy is in trouble and it doesn't make any sense to play games," he said. That's candor.
 
Reading the Economy's Entrails
For the economic mavens studying each minor move of the economy, last week's revision of the gross domestic product did not do much to calm their frazzled nerves. According to the Commerce Department, G.D.P. inched up in the third quarter by a meager 1.8 percent. Since recessions usually end in a torrent of growth -- 6.7 percent is average -- last quarter's figures put the recovery in doubt. "It's a double dip," said Josh Stiles, an analyst at IDEA Inc., a research firm in New York.
 
Yet Another Bad Omen
Industrial output is the Government's gauge for measuring the tangible economy (it excludes services). It even includes the output of the nation's mines. After languishing for three months, industrial output fell by four-tenths of 1 percent, the Federal Reserve said last week. That decline -- led by the automobile industry -- is worrisome because it forecasts further shrinkages in the labor force.
Business is not exactly infused with confidence right now, and its spending plans show it. According to a survey by the Commerce Department, business plans to increase its capital outlays by a timid 5.4 percent next year -- half the rate in the 1980's.
 
COMPANIES
Stempel Stymied
Paleontologists say it took nearly a minute from the time a dinosaur's tail was nipped to the time it felt the pain. For the General Motors Corporation, that nip came way back in the 1970's when imports first started creeping in. Since then, the No. 1 auto maker has been fumbling its way toward competitiveness by trimming jobs and output. Last week, Robert C. Stempel, the company's chairman, said G.M. would become competitive by doing more of the same. The company will trim its work force by 70,000 and close 21 assembly plants. But Mr. Stempel did not say which jobs or plants would go, casting a pall over the holiday season for the entire workforce. With losses this year expected to be as high as $8 billion, Mr. Stempel said he had to act. "G.M. will become a much different corporation," he said.
 
Drexel's Joseph Gets a Rap
Last week, Frederick H. Joseph, the former chairman of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., admitted he probably hadn't done enough to supervise his firm. It was on his watch that Drexel came to dominate the junk-bond business. It was also on his watch that the firm collapsed and Michael Milken, the head of its junk-bond desk, was sent to jail. For his errors, the New York Stock Exchange rapped Mr. Joseph's knuckles -- very softly. The Exchange censured him and barred him from associating with or owning a member firm for two years. The agreement "is an appropriate resolution to a difficult issue," Mr. Joseph said. "One I can now put behind me so that I can go forward with my career." The settlement allows Mr. Joseph to remain as a consultant to Drexel at $350,000 a year.
 
Obviously, This Guy Is No Joker
At least one investment is rising in value. Comic books. Last week at Sotheby's, Harold M. Anderson, the owner of a baseball museum based in Florence, Ala., paid $55,000 for the first Batman comic book ever printed. Mr. Anderson spent $229,845 on 21 books.
 
The Faith of American Express
With the travel business in a slump and so many airlines filing for bankruptcy, you have to have a lot of faith to spend $100 million to buy a travel agency. The American Express Company must be imbued with it. Last week it said it was buying closely held Lifeco, the nation's fifth-largest agency, with $1.20 billion in ticket sales. American Express is the No. 1 travel agency, with $3.25 billion in sales. With the acquisition, American Express will become twice the size of its nearest rival, the Carlson Travel Network. That will give it extra clout to negotiate fares with the airlines -- the ones that stay in business, that is.
 
McDonnell Douglas Gets Choosy
Corporations are supposed to believe in the invisible hand of the market -- but in a pinch there's always the Government. McDonnell Douglas announced it was shopping for a new site on which to build a factory for the MD-12X, its newest passenger jet. Since it will employ about 10,000 workers, McDonnell Douglas wants a building that's roomy, on about 600 acres and adjacent to an airport. But it also wants hundreds of millions of dollars in aid from state and local governments, including tax breaks and worker training programs. Nine sites around the country are competing.
 
Sandoz Rides to the Rescue
When Sandoz Ltd., the big Swiss drug company, said it was acquiring 60 percent of Systemix Inc., for $391.8 million, it was part of a familiar pattern. A group of sharp-minded scientists follow their ideas but suddenly need big money to commercialize them as products. That's when the giants step in. Systemix, is developing ways to separate stem cells from bone marrow cells for the treatment of cancer and AIDS.
 
INTERNATIONAL
An Inharmonic Divergence
 While the United States was pushing its interest rates down last week, the Germans were raising theirs. In a global economy, that combination may not only be disharmonious, but downright dangerous. The Bundesbank raised both of its key rates -- the Lombard and the discount -- by one-half of a percentage point. That puts them at 9.75 percent and 8 percent respectively. That's a tremendous spread compared with 3.5 percent discount rate and 6.5 percent prime rate in the United States. Since investors seek the highest yields, many are expected to flee the dollar and buy German marks. That could drag the dollar down sharply. "The Germans made their move with total disregard for its impact on any other country," said Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics in New York. Letting the dollar fall a little, is not a catastrophe. But "there is a one in three chance of the dollar going into free fall." If the dollar collapsed, "there is nothing we could really do to support it," he said.
 
Maxwell on the Defensive
Last week, the Maxwell Communications Corporation, the largest of the late Robert Maxwell's holdings and the one with the greatest presence in the United States, made a move that riled its British creditors. The company filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code. Maxwell Communications owes its creditors about $2.37 billion. The move was aggressive and defensive. Since Britain does not have a Chapter 11 law, filing in New York was designed to keep the company from being broken up by its creditors to pay back its loans. Maxwell owns Macmillin Inc., the big publisher, and the Official Airline Guide, which publishes airline schedules. After the filing, even Britain's most stiff-lipped bankers were concerned. "We are absolutely livid," one of them said. They haven't been that exercised since, well, Mr. Maxwell was alive.
 
Any Way to Run an Airline?
Not only is the Soviet Union collapsing, running out of food and trying to determine who controls its tens of thousands of nuclear weapons but now Aeroflot, the world's largest airline, is running out of jet fuel. Aeroflot, the national airline of a country that has all but ceased to exist, closed 92 major airports in the republics and announced that 38 others were on the verge of shutting down. Passengers were left stranded throughout the Soviet Union.

HEADLINE: Clinton Record in Leading Arkansas: Successes, but Not Without Criticism

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark.

 BODY:
Bill Clinton, whose record over 11 years as Arkansas Governor is a centerpiece of his campaign for the Democratic Presidential nomination, likes to cite a recent Newsweek poll in which America's governors rated him the nation's most effective Governor.
It is worth remembering, however, that the poll before the last Presidential election accorded the honor to Michael S. Dukakis. 
 Mr. Clinton can point to numerous achievements as leader of one of the nation's poorest states. They include his relentless efforts to increase educational financing and standards, the expansion of health-care services to the poor and to schoolchildren, a national reputation for innovation in government, and a state economy that is growing faster than the national average.
"I think his record as Governor is probably the best record that I know of any Governor, especially when you consider it's not something he just did over a few years, but that it's over 11 years, and he has consistently been on the cutting edge," said Gov. Zell Miller of Georgia, who is supporting Mr. Clinton in the state's Democratic primary.
 
With an Eye to Dukakis
 Mr. Clinton's record will probably be closely scrutinized because unlike an individual lawmaker, a governor can produce a real record in terms of developing and implementing programs. But as Mr. Dukakis painfully learned, a governor's record can be both fragile and an inviting political target.
While the record Mr. Clinton runs on is geared more to long-term change than was Mr. Dukakis's fleeting "Massachusetts Miracle," the Arkansan could be vulnerable on taxes, which increased and became more regressive during his tenure, and on issues like the environment and the social service bureaucracy.
And Mr. Clinton faces the recurring criticism that he has learned the art of political survival too well -- ducking tough battles on issues like tax equity.
"He spends too much time taking care of his enemies and not enough time taking care of his friends," said Tommy Robinson, a former Congressman who ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination for governor in 1990. "Clinton wants everyone to love him."
It is an argument the Governor is quick to dispute.
"Show me another surviving governor who got elected five times during the tough times of the 80's, that got more done and changed more lives and stood up to more interest groups and raised more money for education," Mr. Clinton said in a recent interview
His record on education is widely viewed as the high mark of his tenure. The question some critics ask is whether it is a symbol of his accomplishments or a reminder that his overall record could have been better.
 
Snapping Back
Caution and Success From Early Defeat
 Arkansas is hardly an auspicious springboard for a national campaign. At 2.5 million people, it is the least populous state in the South. Its largest city, Little Rock, has a population of only 174,000, and its economy is dominated by traditional industries like lumber, poultry and oil and gas.
"This is a tough, tough state," said Diane Blair, a political science professor at the University of Arkansas, who is an expert on Arkansas politics and a supporter of Mr. Clinton. "There's a tremendous resistance to taxes. There's an enormous suspicion of activism, particularly by government. He's had to make a lot of tough judgments, and I think on balance his judgments have been excellent. This is a state in which the things that need attention will always outweigh the amount of attention any one individual can give them."
But others argue that governors of bigger states face challenges more complicated than does the leader of a state whose population is only slightly smaller than Chicago's.
A Rhodes Scholar and Yale Law School graduate, Mr. Clinton was first elected in 1978 when, at the age of 32, he became the nation's youngest Governor. His career has been shaped by his lowest moment, which came two years later.
Angered by an increase in automobile license fees and what was taken to be Mr. Clinton's somewhat imperial style, voters kicked him out of office, replacing him with Frank White, a little-known Republican.
Chastened, Mr. Clinton resolved to run again. In 1982, he easily defeated Mr. White and has been Governor ever since.
In his first term, in 1978, he offered a far-ranging package of liberal proposals. Since then, he has painstakingly picked his issues, built his coalitions and chosen his fights. To admirers, that has shown a shrewd ability to use his political capital where it could achieve results. Critics have seen it as timidity in taking on powerful interests.
 
Advances in Education
 Few criticize his record on education.
"A lot of Southern governors have done a lot of talking about education, but the rubber meets the road when you start paying for it," said Dr. Kern Alexander of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, who wrote a brutal indictment of Arkansas's educational system in 1978. "Despite coming from a very poor state, he has done more than talk about it."
Using as a standard state and local revenue per pupil adjusted for personal income, Professor Alexander said Arkansas, which is 47th in per capita income, now ranks 23d in the fiscal effort to support public schools.
Mr. Clinton's push for educational change began in 1983. The program was tough, calling for teacher competency testing that enraged teachers' groups, and it was expensive, calling for a 1 cent increase in the sales tax.
The program, which established standards for teachers and students, mandated smaller classes and elementary school counselors, and established the nation's first eighth-grade test that students must pass before beginning high school.
Other educational programs followed in 1989 and 1991. They included the nation's second program to allow students to choose the schools they would attend, some mergers of inefficient small districts, $1,000 yearly college scholarships for qualifying middle-income and poor students, increases in teacher pay and a revamping of vocational education programs.
Between 1983-84 and 1990-91, the percentage of Arkansas high school graduates going to college rose to 48 percent, from 38 percent. In 1983-84, only 46 percent of the state's high schools offered physics courses and 68 percent, chemistry. Now, they all do.
 
Improving Health Care
 Mr. Clinton also gets high marks on efforts to improve health care, particularly in poor areas. In recent years Arkansas has allocated $15 million for early childhood education and begun new programs in prenatal care and health care for poor children. The Governor has not wavered on some controversial health issues, like the health department's program to distribute condoms to high school students through school clinics.
"He has a real desire to invest in health issues," said Joycelyn Elders, the state's health director. "He has always backed me in tough situations like when he took on the Legislature and fought his guts out for my health department budget."
While employment is expected to grow at a rate of 3 percent this year, compared to a net loss for the nation as a whole, Mr. Clinton cannot take credit for an economic boom. From 1980 to 1990, Arkansas's population grew by only 2.7 percent, as against a 9.7 increase in that of the nation as a whole. In 1980, per capita income in the state was 75.4 percent of the national figure; in 1990 it had only inched up to 76.8 percent.
Business leaders say the Governor's economic-development efforts, including tax incentives, fostering international trade and enhancing job training, have helped Arkansas outpace the nation and its neighboring states in terms of employment growth, growth in manufacturing jobs and income growth in recent years.
Even his critics say Mr. Clinton truly believes in making government work, can be a master at working with the Legislature, has generally hired strong administrators and has a passion for innovative programs, whether one of the nation's first programs to require that welfare recipients work or adopting an Israeli program that teaches parents of 4,500 low-income families how to read to and teach their pre-school children.
 
Answering Critics
Dealing With Taxes And Social Policy
 Still, as much because of Mr. Clinton's abilities as his shortcomings, many critics see what has not been accomplished as clearly as what has been.
Conservatives say he has been too quick to raise taxes. Liberals say he has approved a series of tax breaks for businesses while relying primarily on the sales tax, regarded as the least progressive tax, to improve education. Arkansas is one of only 18 states that tax food at the same rate as other retail sales; the state sales tax is 4.5 percent but local taxes bring the average sales tax to 6 percent.
Mr. Clinton says that his tax policies largely reflect a state Constitution that requires a three-quarters vote of the Legislature to approve any tax increase other than sales taxes and that he pushed for and then supported a ballot proposal for tax reform, a proposal that voters rejected.
As evidence of a broader tax policy, he points to the Legislature's approval last year of an increase in the corporate income tax to help finance vocational education. But some lawmakers grumble that he is taking credit for a program they developed and passed.
"I would say the record of Arkansas since he's been Governor is mixed," said Michael Ettlinger, director of state tax policy at Citizens for Tax Justice, a research and advocacy organization. "I'd say other state income taxes have gotten more progressive, and their's have gotten a little less progressive."
Mr. Clinton is also widely criticized for his environmental record. A study by the Institute for Southern Studies, a research group in Durham, N.C., listed Arkansas 48th among the states in its recent Green Index, which ranked states in terms of the severity of their environmental problems and the rigor of their environmental enforcement.
"I would give him at best a 5 on a scale of 1 to 10," said Chuck Cremeen, president of Arkansas for Environmental Reform.
The Governor concedes that in the tradeoffs he has made economic issues probably took precedence over some environmental ones.
"When I got back in office, I literally had to worry about people being able to keep body and soul together," he said. "And I decided to focus my political energy and my political capital on doing the big things that I thought would help people most over the long run."
Among the state's most glaring problems now is a lawsuit over its juvenile-care system, which charged repeated incidents of abuse at foster homes.
To some, Mr. Clinton is a better idea man and crusader for selected issues than a consistently attentive executive.
"Human services, welfare, I think those things sort of bore him," said John Brummett, editor of Arkansas Life magazine and a longtime newspaper columnist. "They're necessities of government, but they're just sort of messy. There's not a lot of political capital in championing those things as there is in championing education."
Still, even many with criticisms wonder if anyone else could have done better. Because of its poverty, Arkansas has been particularly hard hit by cutbacks in Federal programs. In 1980, Federal money made up 36 percent of the state's revenue; by 1988, it was down to 21 percent.
Few dispute Mr. Clinton's contention that many of the problems are part of a national crisis common to every state.
"One of the reasons I decided to run for President," he said, "was that as the longest-serving Governor in America I had to face the fact that there are limits to what any governor can do in the absence of a national strategy to compete and succeed in the global economy.
"I think you have to ask, What's the standard? I think the standard is, How do you do against the competition? Are you better off than you were when you started? Are you going in the right direction? And have you been willing to change and innovate? It seems to me that's the standard, and I think the results are pretty good."

 CORRECTION:
An article and a chart last Sunday about Bill Clinton's record as Governor of Arkansas misstated several comparative population figures for Arkansas and the United States. Arkansas's population was 2,350,725 in 1990, according to the Census Bureau; it grew 2.81 percent from 1980. The United States population grew 9.78 percent, to 248,709,873.

HEADLINE: Trying to Play by the Rules

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON

DATELINE: INDIANAPOLIS

 BODY:
KATHY BIRK, the manager of Dean Witter's branch here, is known among colleagues and competitors for her dedication to playing by the rules. It's a passion that didn't come casually. When she took her first job as a stockbroker for Prudential Securities in 1980, she felt most comfortable selling ultra-low-risk investments. Her favorite annuity, National Investors, seemed so safe that she even sold it to her parents, who invested the bulk of their savings in it.
One day, abruptly, National Investors went bankrupt, leaving her clients, as well as her parents, in the lurch. She felt terrible. Even worse than the losses, she was haunted by her belief that Prudential's head office had deceived her, keeping the stock of National Investors' parent company on its "buy" list up until the day the annuity went into receivership. 
 "I couldn't believe no one had tipped me off," said Mrs. Birk. "Someone had to have known what was going on." Soon, she quit.
Looking back, she faults herself for having believed in others so blindly. Her chilling experience, during which she considered quitting the business entirely, highlights one of the root tensions in the retail end of the financial services business: The conflict between selling and responsibility to the customer. "We're all in the business of making money," said Mrs. Birk, "but you have to be able to look at yourself in the mirror each morning."
Kathy Birk, according to Andrew J. Johnson, one of the Dean Witter brokers who works in her office, is a stickler for rules. "She is by the book, by the book, by the book," he said, shaking his head as he recalled how she has pestered him to follow her instructions.
But in these back-to-basics days of managing other people's money, Mrs. Birk believes that investors in Indianapolis -- in the whole country as a whole for that matter -- want two things: a safe, simple and predictable financial product and a broker who is equally safe and predictable.
 
Return of the Little Guy
 More than four years after the 1987 stock market crash, which deeply frightened and repelled small investors, individuals are returning to stocks and mutual funds. Bottom-of-the-barrel interest rates have pried them away from safer, but low-yielding, investments like certificates of deposit.
Financial services firms like Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. that are geared toward individual investors are reaping sizable rewards from the shift -- net income for the firm's securities division shot up to $119 million through the first nine months of this year, from just $82 million a year earlier.
Just two years ago, the brokerage business was wailing about the flight of small investors, badly spooked by the market crash, and wondering if they would come back. After the crash, thousands of small investors filed complaints against their brokers, accusing them of pushing unsuitable investments, misrepresenting the risks and returns on investments, doing poor research, churning customers' accounts to earn higher commissions and, in some cases, out-and-out stealing.
The crash, and the subsequent complaints by small investors, were played out against the larger tapestry of the freewheeling, greedy atmosphere that gripped Wall Street during the 1980's and the crop of giant-killer insider-trading scandals that dominated the business news pages.
Now, Mrs. Birk and others contend, only where brokers win the lasting confidence of their customers can profits like those Dean Witter is now enjoying be assured long term. Compliance -- that is, following the rules -- has become the watchword for brokerage house branch managers, though the extent to which many managers are genuinely serious about compliance and not merely playing lip service to the idea is not fully clear.
 
Who to Trust?
 Mrs. Birk insists she is deadly serious about compliance. "The arrows are coming from every direction," she said, referring to customers' disillusionment with the industry.
Indeed. She owes her job to complicance problems Dean Witter had in Indianapolis in 1985.
A broker in the office employed a trading strategy using high-risk instruments, options in this case, which were inappropriate for unsophisticated middle-income investors. Several customers filed complaints, but the broker had already left the firm by then. (Dean Witter refuses to reveal the broker's name, making it impossible to determine from public documents whether the individual was ever disciplined or still employed in the securities industry.)
The office manager, who was responsible for supervising the broker, then stepped aside, returning to the stockbroker ranks in the office, a job he still holds.
After three months of leaving the position vacant, Dean Witter selected Mrs. Birk, who had joined the Dean Witter office two years earlier. "She basically got the job by default. Nobody else wanted it," said Mr. Johnson, who has been with the office since 1979.
Mrs. Birk was left to pick up the pieces. The case went into arbitration and a settlement was eventually reached with the customer that cut sharply into the office's net income. Mrs. Birk's bonus, tied to office earnings, suffered -- despite the fact that she had become manager after the incident occurred.
No Wall Street firm is free from compliance problems, but Dean Witter had a reputation among state securities industry regulators as a firm somewhat more concerned with boosting profits than with playing strictly by the book. "Our compliance record is very good now, certainly better than it was seven years ago," said James Flynn, Dean Witter's director of corporate communications in New York.
In Indianapolis at least, Mrs. Birk seems to have led the way in making a financial services branch office succeed and earn strong profits while building a reputation as a straight shooter.
"She balances as well as anyone I've seen," said Thomas O'Neil, Dean Witter's regional director in the Midwest, referring to the line a branch manager walks between a broker's needs, a client's interests and a head office's directives.
From the time she took the helm of the office, located in Carmel, a suburb at the northern edge of Indianapolis, through 1990 revenues have grown by an average of 18 percent a year. Last year, Dean Witter closed its downtown branch and merged it with the suburban office, making Mrs. Birk sole branch manager.
Office revenue this year is near $9 million, among the best of any Dean Witter office in the country. Mrs. Birk's earnings are now in six figures, and she is up for promotion to senior vice president next month.
"This business is not as mysterious or romantic as a lot of people think," Mrs. Birk volunteered, sitting squarely behind her desk in a no-nonsense blue suit. "The bottom line is sales."
To sell financial products, Mrs. Birk said, she primes her brokers any way she can. She expects discipline and resilience, and encourages an entrepreneurial attitude, leaving each broker to find an individual way to rack up sales. She nurtures and prods them, alternating her support and sympathy with a demanding toughness.
She recalled the time she drove to a nearby bar to retrieve a broker who had left early from a scheduled evening shift: "It was embarrassing for him. But I thought: 'How can I expect others to work hard when they all knew where this guy was?' "
 
Keeping Tabs
 But if the bottom line is sales and a significant portion of her income and that of her brokers is based on how much they sell, how can compliance be job No. 1, as she asserts it is?. Her answer is a simple one: Dean Witter's raison d'etre is to make money for its parent, Sears, Roebuck and Company; the way to do that is through sales; the way to assure those sales, particularly over the long haul, is to treat customers fairly and honestly. And that means, among other things, keeping an eye on what your brokers are up to.
There are plenty of temptations, many far less egregious than putting the unsophisticated in high-risk stock options or churning an account. For example, brokers earn a slightly higher commission on Dean Witter in-house mutual funds. And they rely largely on the head office in New York for research on specific stocks, which can put them at the mercy of a sell-side analyst overly optimistic about a particular investment the firm would like to see pushed.
So she may grumble about having to sift through the tall pile of white and yellow order tickets that await her at the end of each day, but she doesn't feel comfortable until she does. Compliance -- and her bitter lesson at Prudential -- compel her to hammer at her brokers again and again with a salient lesson: sell clients only those investments that are suitable to the client's individual needs.
"I tell them every day, 'Listen to the client's objective. Pay attention to it.' " she said. At weekly staff meetings she doesn't hesitate to bring up cases in which she questions a broker's judgement.
Miriam Dant, Indiana's Securities Commissioner, said Mrs. Birk is one of the few financial service branch managers in Indianapolis who does not act afraid or combative when asked for information about a specific transaction or broker at her firm and that she cooperates fully with all inquiries.
Mrs. Dant added that, although the number of complaints filed against brokers in Indiana has been growing over the past 10 months -- most of them alleging churning of accounts -- no formal complaints have been filed against Kathy Birk's office.
"They run a pretty clean office," said an official of the North American Securities Administrators Association, based in Washington. That group and the National Association of Securities Dealers maintains a database of registration and licensing information on brokers, including complaints against them.
When the official searched the database for the name of every broker in Mrs. Birk's office last week, only two pending complaints by customers from the last five years were found, both from 1991. One was so recent that while Mrs. Birk knew of its existence, she had not seen it and couldn't comment.
Mrs. Birk said the other involves an elderly customer, now ill with Alzheimer's disease. She contends Dean Witter correctly carried out the customer's instructions, delivered prior to the onset of his illness.
Common-sense advice, rather than any divination of high-risk opportunity, is the major task for a retail broker. Mrs. Birk and her staff devote much of their time to patient explanations to customers of the benefits of, for example, a diverse portfolio.
On a recent morning in the Carmel office, a steady stream of assistants and brokers came through Mrs. Birk's office to seek an approving signature. Most required only a quick glance and a flash of the pen; others, a little more discussion.
"Now look at this one," she said, studying a letter from a client. The client, whose work had apparently taken him out of town, wrote to ask that funds from his maturing C.D. be switched into a stock in which he already had a position.
"We can do that," she said hestitantly, "but it certainly wouldn't be in his best interest." She arranged for the customer's broker to talk to him before making the trade.
Mrs. Birk oversees an office with 36 brokers and trainees, only one woman among them. She maintains that gender is not an issue in her office, even though she sees certain advantages to what she describes as her nonmale style of management, emphasizing mediation and conciliation.
 
Job Qualifications
 In a business still dominated by men, her own path upward has not always been easy. Mrs. Birk said she was hired as a trainee broker at Prudential Bache in 1980 because she was a woman. But her boss paid her $400 a month less than the four male trainees who worked beside her. "I didn't make an issue of it," she said. "I thought: 'I'll show him.' "
Mrs. Birk, in fact, said she would not hire a job applicant with the qualifications she offered at the time. But she said she does not do female applicants any extra favors, despite her own example as someone who needed a chance to grow into the job for which she wasn't fully qualified.
As for her knack for mediation and nurturing, she said, previous superiors set a standard in her mind of what not to do: dominating colleagues and staff, bullying, insisting that they be obeyed and not questioned.
Mrs. Birk has sometimes wondered, she said, if her approach compromises her control. She recognizes the danger of being perceived as soft. But in the end, she said, she trusts her sense of where the balance lies.
"I'm a better leader than a follower," she said.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
From the Frigid North Is Carved a Native Terrain

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS

DATELINE: TORONTO

 BODY:
THE idea for Nunavut, a land where Canada's Eskimos could rule themselves, had been around for a long time before it was accepted by Ottawa last week. Still, the announcement that a fifth of the country will be carved from the Northwest Territories and entrusted to 17,500 Eskimos caused many Canadians to pull out maps for a look at the great white vastness that has been at the heart of much of their romance about themselves. A sample of what Nunavut, meaning "our land" in the Eskimos' Inuktituk language, will entail:
The Land -- An American serviceman stationed in the Arctic in World War II described the region as "nothin' but miles and miles of miles and miles," a region that most Canadians know little of. The "true north" of which they sing in 'O Canada' is officially designated as beginning at the 60th degree of latitude, 1,500 miles beyond the summer cottages that are the furthest north that most Canadians venture. Another 1,500 miles lie between there and Alert, the last settlement before the North Pole. Under Ottawa's proposal, most of this will become Nunavut. 

History -- Human activity has been traced back 4,000 years; contacts with Europeans began with Norsemen around the 11th century A.D. Then came maritime explorers hoping to short-cut their way to China, missionaries, and all manner of roughcut adventurers. Ottawa remained largely uninvolved until a 1939 court ruling deemed the Eskimos to be a federal responsibility. After World War II, interest was led by the Pentagon, which was concerned first with building early-warning radars against a Soviet bomber attack, later with the hide-and-seek of nuclear submarines beneath the polar ice cap.
Living -- For the Eskimos, or Inuit as most prefer to be called, a nomadic life based on hunting of polar bears, seals and whales has been in decline. Most communities now cluster around government centers like Resolute. Unemployment, alcoholism, suicide and sexually transmitted diseases are at chronic levels, causing some Inuit to advocate a return to traditional life styles. Others see salvation in an end to paternalism. Thus Nunavut, and the prospect of the Inuit controlling at least part of the $1 billion that Ottawa spends annually on its Arctic domain.
Economy -- To win Ottawa's consent, Inuit leaders made major concessions on land and resource ownership. They will have title to barely one-sixth of Nunavut's 770,000 square miles, and mineral rights over 14,000 square miles. The rest will remain "Crown land," or Ottawa's. While Inuit negotiators demanded mineral rights in some of the most geologically promising areas, this was a lottery. Development of known oil, gas and gold reserves has been minimal, and much prospecting remains to be done.
Politics -- With barely 2,500 "outsiders," an Inuit political majority in Nunavut is assured. But some Inuit fear that they could eventually be outnumbered. Franchise qualifications are among details to be settled, with Inuit leaders favoring a five-year residency requirement. Others worry that Nunavut's start-up costs, estimated at $500 million, together with $160 million a year in annual outlays beyond what it costs to administer the territory from Yellowknife, the Northwest Territories capital, will drain scarce funds. These and other issues will be debated in a plebiscite on Nunavut among the Northwest Territories' 52,000 residents sometime in 1992.

HEADLINE: Mr. Gephardt's Irresponsible Economics

 BODY:
Representative Richard Gephardt, the House majority leader, and several Democratic colleagues gave the nation a wrongheaded and irresponsible economics lesson on trade with Japan last week.
Mr. Gephardt, Senator Don Riegle and four Michigan Representatives said trade deficits with Japan help explain why the U.S. is trapped in recession and why nearly one million Americans have lost their jobs. Mr. Gephardt's elixir: Shut out Japanese cars unless Japan eliminates the trade deficit over five years. 
 But any attempt to cut back imports would destroy as many American jobs as it would protect. If Americans bought less from abroad, the dollar would rise in value -- making U.S. exports increasingly expensive. That would drive down sales, throwing tens of thousands of Americans out of work, from farmers to aeronautical engineers.
It's reasonable for the U.S. to target specific industries where Japan violates international rules to block U.S. exports. But Mr. Gephardt wants to target the whole country on the basis of an overall trade balance. Yet trade balances are not a measuring rod for unfair trade practices. The U.S., as one sobering example, is running a $20 billion trade surplus with Europe. Does Mr. Gephardt believe Europe should retaliate?
Mr. Gephardt's bill would protect Chrysler, Ford and General Motors. But, by jacking up prices, protectionist legislation could cost American taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars for each job saved. Why doesn't Mr. Gephardt bury his protectionist bill and instead ask taxpayers to fork over, say, $80,000 to each auto worker displaced by Japanese imports. That would be cheaper for taxpayers, better for the auto worker . . . and honest.

HEADLINE: U.S. Shouldn't Concede Asian Market to Japan

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Accolades for "Power of the Yen Winning Asia" (Business Day, Dec. 5). American business faces an uphill struggle in East Asia and the Pacific, but it is not a struggle we should forfeit. It is important to remember how much the Asia-Pacific market means to the United States. 
 Trans-Pacific trade accounts for 35 percent of all our trade (about 50 percent greater than trade with Europe). But Japan's dynamism means that it dominates the region economically. (Recent levels of new United States investment in Asia have been roughly equal to Japan's, although the continued capital crunch here and a corresponding glut in Japan indicate this will not be the case for long.)
Much of Japan's lead in Asia may be attributed to proximity: Japan dominates the region as the United States dominates the Western Hemisphere. But given the relative size of the United States and Japanese economies ($5.2 trillion versus $2.8 trillion), Japan's growing power in the Asian market is remarkable.
But it would be overpessimistic to assume that Japan is destined to absorb its neighbors economically and to lock out non-Japanese trade and investment. Continued growth in United States exports, along with small but important market-opening successes in bilateral negotiations with Japan and others in Asia, illustrates that neither American companies nor our Government is willing to cede the region to Japan alone. If this approach is maintained, and if the United States can address chronic fiscal deficits, low personal savings and lack of focus on education, there is no reason we cannot compete as effectively in Asia as elsewhere.
Moreover, Japan's economy and society are evolving in ways that can benefit United States trade and investment. After three decades of remarkable growth under an export-led strategy that has been of great benefit to Japanese business -- but less so to Japanese consumers, who still pay what we would consider outrageous prices for many basic goods and services -- Japan is shifting its priorities from heavy reliance on investment and manufacturing abroad and to domestic infrastructure development. The Japanese Government will need to examine economic and business arrangements that have locked out foreign competition. Other East Asian countries may similarly reorient as they move to industrialized status, creating additional demand for American goods and services.
Perhaps the most immediate concern is saving the multilateral trading system. The United States and Japan need to rescue the floundering Uruguay Round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiations. Locking Japan and its East Asian neighbors into binding commitments to liberalize their markets -- by, for example, opening up to foreign agricultural products (in Japan) and improving protection of patents and other intellectual property (in the rest of Asia) -- will help American companies doing business there.
The increasing drift toward economic regionalism in Asia and elsewhere may be unavoidable. But a strong set of enforceable global trading rules can help mitigate the problems for the American economy that may be caused by Japan's dominance in Asia.

HEADLINE: In the Nation;
What's To Debate?

BYLINE: By TOM WICKER

 BODY:
Mario Cuomo warned the nation that he would not run for President unless New York's massive budget crisis was resolved first. Those who thought he was merely playing games found out last week that he meant what he said.
 That's a welcome change from the usual political double talk and deniability. But there's no use pretending, as some Democrats are doing, that the party's chances for 1992 have not been hurt. Mr. Cuomo would have been the most commanding and articulate figure the Democrats could have put up -- and articulateness is one quality, among many, badly needed in the White House. 
George Bush is undoubtedly relieved that Mr. Cuomo has taken himself out ofthe race; but the President is by no means out of the woods. A gaggle of Administration experts met with him last week to debate his economic options, including whether to declare an emergency that would permit him to break last year's budget agreement with Congress.
 What's to debate?
 General Motors has announced it will close 21 plants, lay off 9,000 white-collar workers in 1992 and eliminate more than 70,000 jobs in the next few years. The company's troubles are not all due to the recession, but a sluggish economy speeded this long-needed "restructuring" of what used to be the flagship of U.S. business. And all those lost jobs won't help recovery.
 For the week ended Dec. 7, first-time claims for unemployment insurance rose by 79,000 -- about twice the number forecast, and a strong sign that the economy is not slowly recovering, as usually claimed, but is contracting.
 In the New York metropolitan area, more than 400,000 jobs have been lost since 1989. In Manhattan alone, job losses in the last two years have wiped out all the private-sector growth of the 1980's, and there are now fewer non-government jobs than there were in 1980.
 And that's only a sampling of the pre-Christmas bad news, with stores still uncrowded and layoffs increasing everywhere. And since G.M. has not specified which of its plants it will close, uncertainty about their personal futures must be a matter of real worry for most of that huge work force.
 Chairman Alan Greenspan of the Federal Reserve -- which dropped the discount rate a full point on Friday -- has conceded that he had underestimated the seriousness of the situation, and that "the economy is struggling." But Mr. Greenspan, in testimony to the House Ways and Means Committee, continued to insist that nothing should be done that might increase the budget deficit.
 There's the rub for the White House. In last year's settlement with Congress, it was agreed that any revenue losses or increases in spending would be offset by gains or cuts elsewhere, so that the deficit would not rise. Mr. Bush would have to declare an emergency to break the agreement, which he has so far refused to do.
 But all the options discussed at the White House this week would run up the deficit. They apparently included an increase in the personal exemption for income-tax payers, a tax credit for middle-income earners and a one-year cut in the onerous and regressive Social Security payroll tax.
 With a Presidential election coming up, the struggling economy is an acute political concern for the White House. With so many unemployed and so many fearful of losing their jobs, taking stimulative action might well be more immediately popular with voters than holding the line on the deficit. So some Administration aides want to send Congress a stimulative proposal designed to have bipartisan support and win quick passage.
 Others argue for a distinctly Republican proposal, based on conservative ideas, like Mr. Bush's familiar call for a reduced capital-gains tax. Such a plan, they concede, might win little Congressional support but would provide a strong conservative platform for the campaign. Mr. Greenspan, meanwhile, cautions against "short-term fiscal stimulus" that might not be helpful to long-term growth.
 This debate seems mostly defensive and technical: What's best for the Administration politically? What's best for the economy in the long term? There's little suggestion of acute Administration concern for the human misery of recession -- which occurs in the short term and surely seems like an emergency to those who suffer it. Mario Cuomo, better than anyone else, could have dramatized that for the nation.

HEADLINE: Credit Cards Cost Exactly What They Say

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 "Credit Cards Cost More Than You Think" (letter, Dec. 16) by Prof. S. A. Ravid reflects fundamental misunderstanding of credit-card interest. 
Most customers have the use of the borrowed funds from the purchase date until the payment due date on their statement. In some cases, this grace period can be as long as 50 days. Then, even when payment is due, most customers can repay the entire outstanding balance interest-free. In effect, interest is waived for them, though they borrowed money, regardless of the amount.
 If the customer pays the entire principal balance on the due date, the customer has had an interest-free loan. If the customer pays less, he or she will have to pay interest at the stated rate. The interest rate does not increase with the amount of payment.
 Finally, and perhaps most important, none of this is a secret. Everything is disclosed by the card issuer, as required by the Federal Truth in Lending Act. Credit cards do not cost more than you think. They cost exactly what they say they cost -- no more, no less.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
America's in the Balcony as Europe Takes Center Stage

BYLINE: By JOSEF JOFFE; Josef Joffe is editorial page editor and columnist of Suddeutsche Zeitung in Munich.

DATELINE: MUNICH, Germany

 BODY:
IS United States influence in Europe going the way of the dollar?
For much of this century, the mighty greenback was worth more than four Deutsche marks; today, it has sunk below 1.60. Not that long ago, about the time when Stormin' Norman had flattened the last Iraqi berm, folks were celebrating the birth of a "unipolar" world in which one power towered above the rest -- and that was the United States. But where is the United States today? 
 Something must have happened on the way to the top of the power pyramid. In Europe, you have to look very hard to see No. 1.
 
A New Shuttlemeister
 True, Messrs. Bush and Baker have recently been preoccupied with other items, notably the Middle East and the former Soviet Union. The Secretary of State has logged more miles crisscrossing the Middle East than the shuttlemeister, Henry Kissinger, did in the 1970's. Just last week, the best minds of the State Department were wrestling with the question whether, apart from tea and coffee, cookies ought to be served to Israelis and Palestinians loitering in the halls of Foggy Bottom.
To be fair, it is right and fitting that President Bush should be spending more time in a recession-weary America; after all, it is only 317 days until election time. And it is just as urgent that Mr. Baker should try to round up as many Soviet nukes as possible before they wind up in the global cash-and-carry market and thence in the hands of such New World Order stalwarts as Iran, Libya and North Korea.
But in the meantime, others are calling the tune in Europe, hardly an insignificant place on the geopolitical map. The last time the United States played a starring role in the Old World was circa 1989-90, when the Bush Administration brilliantly stage-managed German reunification. That wasn't as hard as getting the Syrians to shake hands with the Israelis, but it was an impressive feat nonetheless.
Wary of German clout, France and Britain had to be coaxed and cajoled. Still dreaming of selling Germany's unification for Germany's neutralization, Moscow had to be checked and reassured. And all the while, Washington had to keep a gentle leash on Bonn lest it stray from the path of Western virtue.
In 1989-90, the United States was leading; today it is lagging. Two years ago, Washington did all the right things in Europe: making sure that Germany was reunified in the West, managing the demise of the Soviet empire so that it would go out with a whimper and not with a bang, harnessing Europe's resources in the war against Iraqi imperialism. This was not a bad beginning for the New World Order.
But today? The most significant events in Europe are unfolding without, and sometimes against, the United States. In Maastricht, the site of the most recent summit meeting of the European Community, the Twelve poured the foundations for a mighty economic-monetary bloc that might yet spell more trade troubles for the United States -- and for global free trade in general.
 
A Power Play
 Just last week in Brussels, curtains rose and revealed an astounding, indeed historical, power play on the European stage. Virtually alone in opposition for months, Germany had practically Germanized the community's Yugoslav policy overnight. (At this point, only readers who know the difference between Slovakia, Slavonia and Slovenia might want to proceed; Slobbovia doesn't count.)
Since the early fall, Bonn had been pressing for the recognition of the two breakaway republics of Slovenia and Croatia, the latter the target of a bloody expansionist war unleashed by Serbia. Just as strenuously, France, Britain and the United States tried to resist, on the grounds that recognition would demolish the last chances for a political settlement.
Bonn persisted -- and won. Now the entire European Community is set to recognize Slovenia and Croatia by Jan. 15.
To many Americans, Balkan politics might be about as real as those grainy Hitchcock classics in which old ladies vanish in sooty trains and Slavic heavies in operetta uniforms plot for power and profit. But in Europe, the war of the Yugoslavs has been a double watershed. In the first place, it revealed -- like a bolt of lightning -- a landscape strewn with short-fused powder kegs stretching eastward from Berlin and Vienna. In the second place, it dramatized Europe's new power relationships.
 
Left Behind
 On the one hand, the United States didn't care, and was left behind. On the other hand, Germany claimed -- and won -- the seat at the head of the table, outmaneuvering Britain and the Netherlands while tying France to its side.
Does it matter? On one level, it does not, because the German power play, arguably, was executed for a reasonable cause. Europe's hand-wringing did not stop the slaughter, and maybe a united front will instill a bit more caution among the "Greater Serbia" nationalists.
On a deeper level, though, the Yugoslav tragedy might remind the United States that Europe -- the fountainhead of most significant conflicts in the past 500 years -- is neither pacified nor peripheral to American interests.
Right now, the United States is forgoing, perhaps in a fit of absent-mindedness, a great chance to shape the fate of Europe behind the former Iron Curtain.
Eager as they are for American assistance, Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia et al. have learned to look to Bonn-Berlin, and thence to Brussels, for money and guidance. The southern ex-Soviet republics are looking toward Turkey and Iran. In Washington, however, there isn't even a pale copy of those grand designs that, in the 1940's, gave unto Europe what mattered most to America: stability, prosperity and democracy.
Certainly peace in the Middle East is a must, and so is a strategy that would relieve Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Byelorussia of the wherewithal for a nuclear civil war. But Europe is still the greatest chunk of power next to the United States. Americans may be coming to believe that Europe can take care of itself, but this has proved a dubious proposition in the past.
Today, the siren songs of neo-isolationism are being intoned by the left and the right. Historically, the isolationist impulse was always directed against Europe, not against the world as such. But the United States will not be No. 1 in the world if it becomes irrelevant in Europe.

HEADLINE: The Atchison, Topeka And the Bullet Train

BYLINE: By Tony Hiss; Tony Hiss, a staff writer for The New Yorker, is writing a book on transportation. His most recent book is "The Experience of Place."

 BODY:
THE nine railroad books sitting on my desk -- a sampling from the cream of the latest crop -- are extraordinary documents: bold and buoyant and some of the first fruits produced by the emerging post-interstate approach to transportation thinking. This approach is a collaborative process that looks ahead a generation or so to a unified network of transportation links in North America, a system in which high-speed trains, medium-speed trains, light-rail lines, scenic roads, bicycle paths and even hiking trails will have taken on the same importance the interstates and the airports have already assumed.
This is an area in which breathtaking ideas bubble up almost overnight and then, with equal suddenness, get taken seriously -- people in New York City, for instance, are proposing to outshine London, Paris and Tokyo by healing an old wound, tearing down the much detested building that houses the Amtrak railroad station on 34th Street and replacing it with an exact replica of the soaring Roman vaults and great greenhouse skylights of the original 1910 Pennsylvania Station by McKim, Mead & White that once stood there. Similarly, an open-space group based in Washington wants the country to designate and preserve at least 10 percent of the highways we already have as a national system of scenic back roads. And the National Park Service's 1990 National Trails Agenda Project recommends "that a trail exist within 15 minutes of most Americans' homes." 
 As for the printed page, here are nine straightforward, substantial and well-researched books about trains in which all the authors, editors, photographers and publishers involved have successfully managed to break away from the old self-conscious, hangdog and almost occultist "railroadiana" conventions of so many postwar books about train travel -- books in which the tone was either wistful or aggrieved, and railroads were presented as part of a time that was either just about to be irrevocably sealed off from modern life or else already had been. None of that here. Strangled sobs and gnashed teeth have been blue-penciled (or delete-keyed) from their pages, and instead trains are presented as a given, a permanent asset reinvented again and again by succeeding generations.
Although these books address themselves to three centuries of railroading (19th, 20th and early 21st), most of them anchor their subjects firmly in the urgencies of the 1990's: Jack Simmons' magisterial work, THE VICTORIAN RAILWAY (Thames and Hudson, $39.95), for example, shows us the lasting effects of the successes and failures of the mid- and late-19th-century British environmentalists and preservationists (who, of course, didn't yet have these words for themselves). The preservationists beat back one scheme to run a railroad directly through Stonehenge, and trounced another one that would have built an iron viaduct down the middle of the Thames. But Mr. Simmons concludes that the "massive and hideous bridges" put up in 1864 to take trains into Charing Cross station -- bridges still in use today -- have "damaged the face of south London irreparably."
George F. Scheer 3d's BOOKED ON THE MORNING TRAIN: A Journey Through America (Algonquin, $19.95) even makes it plain just how rapidly a new assessment of America's transportation situation has overtaken people in this country. Mr. Scheer's book is one of two under review here about the transforming effects of traveling over every one of the thousands of passenger route miles in the Amtrak timetable -- the other is the newly reissued MAKING TRACKS: An American Rail Odyssey (Owl/Holt, Paper, $14.95) by Terry Pindell. As Mr. Scheer acknowledges in his epilogue, with disarming candor, he began work on his book in the mid-1980's thinking he might end up with yet one more tome for the overstocked shelves of railroad lugubriousness: "I thought I might be writing a requiem for Amtrak and for passenger rail travel in the United States. As it has turned out, I was longer than I ever imagined getting into print, and, more surprisingly, in the interim Amtrak has grown stronger rather than weaker" and "seems now to be more popular among travelers, more sound fiscally, and more secure politically than at any previous time."
There are some further signs in this stack of books that railroading can once again be treated as a full partner in the transportation equation: the subject is capturing the imagination of people who until recently haven't been known for writing about, or taking pictures of, railroads -- George Scheer is host of a late-night jazz program on the National Public Radio station in Chapel Hill, N.C.; Terry Pindell is an English teacher who's been a candidate for mayor in Keene, N.H.; and Gary J. Benson, who took the unforgettable full-color photographs of modern freight trains in ROLLING THUNDER: A Portrait of North American Railroading (Norton, $49.95), was best known, before he became fascinated with railroads in 1986, for his work documenting the heroism and frustrations of big-city firefighters. Nicholas Faith, a London journalist who has written books about wine and about auction houses, tells us at the beginning of THE WORLD THE RAILWAYS MADE (Carroll & Graf, $22.95) that his new book was in fact sparked by a series he wrote for The Economist in 1985 entitled "Return Train," which, "somewhat to my surprise, established that virtually every country in the civilised world was investing heavily in railways."
Three of the books on this list -- Mr. Benson's "Rolling Thunder" plus books about the Santa Fe and the Canadian Pacific railroads -- are among the most gorgeously and lovingly produced railroad books of the year. Two of the books here -- Mr. Benson's and SUPERTRAINS: Solutions to America's Transportation Gridlock (St. Martin's, $35), by Joseph Vranich -- would easily qualify for an all-categories list of the most compelling books of 1991.
However little regard you have for freight trains, particularly now that they've done away with cabooses, spend even an hour turning the pages of Mr. Benson's book (it also carries a short, information-packed text by Fred W. Frailey) and you will find it hard ever again to look unfeelingly at a battered diesel hauling a clanking string of empty coal cars. Gary Benson does for freight trains and their settings what Ansel Adams did for Yosemite. The photographs here are shockingly beautiful, even achingly so, because they use the overarching strength of the landscape and the seasons -- purple mountains, orange deserts, numbing cold, shimmering heat -- to make visible a more fragile kind of strength, today's giant freight trains. These mile-long trains weigh tens of millions of pounds and must be pulled through the countryside by diesel-electric engines that, working in tandem, have as much power as 15,000 horses. "Rolling Thunder" shows us that the strength of these trains endures only because all day and every day they get renewed by the 230,000 men and women who staff America's freight railroads.
Mr. Vranich's "Supertrains" is another horizon enlarger, but instead of showing us an asset we've already got, he focuses on a yawning void, our almost 40-year-long campaign to persuade ourselves that we don't want the high-speed trains that dozens of other countries -- including the Portuguese and the South Koreans -- are now busily acquiring to save themselves from both gridlock and from what Mr. Vranich calls "winglock," meaning intolerable airport delays. The news that Mr. Vranich brings is that we've done such a first-rate job of hypnotizing ourselves on this subject that many people haven't noticed that demand for high-speed trains has become a powerful new grass-roots cause in this country.
This new movement, as Mr. Vranich has discovered, already has enough momentum so that, despite continuing hostility from many in the Bush Administration, the first components of a 21st-century American network of high-speed train lines -- a 250-miles-per-hour German magnetic-levitation line (Maglev) in Orlando, Fla., and the first stage of a 167-m.p.h. line from Dallas to Houston -- will be up and running before the end of the century. Mr. Vranich even has a long-term hope for American transportation -- quiet would once more descend on the land: a six-car, 250-m.p.h. Maglev train makes less sound "than the noise generated by one automobile on an interstate. . . . Cows don't even look up."
VISIONS & VISIONARIES: The Art & Artists of the Santa Fe Railway (Peregrine Smith/Gibbs Smith, $34.95) by Sandra D'Emilio and Suzan Campbell is also a picture book, the first to make public a generous selection from the Santa Fe's largely unknown and immense collection of dazzlingly colored oils and watercolors by Taos and Santa Fe artists and by painters the railroad lured to the Southwest by offering them studio space on the rim of the Grand Canyon.
SURVEYING THE CANADIAN PACIFIC: Memoir of a Railroad Pioneer (University of Utah, $24.95) by R. M. Rylatt is the first publication of a deservedly treasured family heirloom. Rylatt had been quartermaster of a British survey party in the Canadian Rockies in the 1870's, and in later life he quietly set down for his children in a leather-bound journal a matter-of-fact account of his harrowing adventures. In the same book he drew for them a series of remarkably accomplished watercolors of the untrammeled wilderness landscapes that had caught at his heart.
Finally, a word of praise for OLD RAILS' TALES (Press of San Francisco, 2440 16th Street, No. 234, San Francisco, Calif. 94103; Cloth, $46.95; Paper, $34.95), volume one of an up-to-the-minute American railroad oral history edited by Alan Allen. This book is so in touch with modern railroading that it even records the energetic, compassionate and no-regrets reminiscences of Pat Lollis, a Californian born in 1953 who worked for the Santa Fe Railway as an engineer from 1974 until 1989 and who was, as she notes, "the first woman to run an Amtrak train out here" for the railroad as well as "the first woman engineer in California for Santa Fe."

HEADLINE: After the Rate Cuts, What?

BYLINE: By ROBERT JOHNSON; Robert Johnson is managing director of global trading at Bankers Trust.

 BODY:
THE Federal Reserve's one-point cut in the discount rate on Friday underscores the seriousness of the current recession, reinforcing that this is not a garden variety recession. The fear and pessimism among debt-laden consumers and business executives are stronger than is usual at this stage of the business cycle, reflecting deeper doubts about the long-term health of the economy -- doubts that might themselves prolong and deepen the downturn.
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, touched on some of this in his testimony before Congress last week. And Friday's strong move by the Fed suggests that he is even more worried than he has publicly acknowledged. 
 There are three valid causes for such extreme pessimism: The traditional tools of macroeconomic policy appear ineffective, economic cooperation among the allied nations seems to have broken down, and the private sector has no clear source of strength to propel the economy.
Monetary policy has had difficulty jump-starting the economy because interest rate reductions by the Fed have not entirely reached consumers and businesses. Troubled financial institutions have used them instead as a means to rebuild their earnings flows to survive. Futhermore, lenders appear to be reluctant to extend credit at any interest rate if they believe there is risk of default.
And even if interest rate reductions were passed through to the public, fresh spending might not result, as consumers would likely use the money to reduce their private debt load. Eventually, debt reduction will liberate purchasing power. But the linkage between rate reductions and renewed spending is weak in the near term.
Many fear that fiscal policy cannot be effective in the current environment. Any move that enlarges the budget deficit may cause long-term interest rates to rise and depress the economy. And tax cuts may not have a strong stimulative impact because the proceeds may also go toward paying down debt or purchase imports.
The second cause for fear is the weak private sector. The construction industry is moribund. Debt-laden businesses have been unwilling to spend and eager to close plants and lay off workers. This has put further pressure on wages -- and exacerbated fears encouraging further consumer retrenchment, contributing to a downward spiral.
Executives have also been reluctant to expand capacity because of a budget deficit that will ultimately have to be reduced by a combination of taxes increases and spending cuts, both of which will depress the economy in the future.
The third source of fear is that we cannot rely on other countries to spark economic growth. Exports from the United States have been the silver lining in this recession, but are simply too small a percentage of American economic activity to levitate the economy. And the buyers of our goods -- including the Japanese and the Europeans -- are watching their economies slow down, diminishing their appetite for American products.
Furthermore, the Asian and European economies, which have built their postwar success on a strategy of export-led growth, are not ready to make the profound changes in their laws, regulations and political structures necessary to buoy worldwide economic activity.
This is particularly troublesome because the United States's ability to influence other nations to make these transformations is more limited than ever since World War II. The collapse of the Soviet Union reduces the value of the defense umbrella that the United States provides to its allies. And our flagging influence was made clear last Thursday when the German Bundesbank aggressively raised interest rates in the face of a slowing German and world economy; Japan may be on the verge of raising taxes. Those we call allies are taking actions that add to the deflationary pressures on the United States.
So what should be done?
President Bush, who has formidable skills as an international diplomat and leader, should pressure Japan and Germany to adopt stimulative policies and urge that European and Asian markets be opened. Domestically, interest rates could be reduced a step further if necessary. Lower rates will lead to refinancing and could arrest the decline in the values of property and lift consumer sentiment. They will also weaken the dollar, helping to spur foreign direct investment in this country and leading to greater profitability for exporters.
On the fiscal side, a package concentrating on a burst of spending on public works and education would provide the maximum stimulus for the economy, but would be difficult to enact after a decade of ideological combat centered on the evils of Government spending.
Finally, to influence psychology, our nation's leaders can learn from the example of Magic Johnson. He showed courage and strength in acknowledging his illness. Last week's statements by Mr. Greenspan and Samuel Skinner, the new White House Chief of Staff, acknowledging the severity of the current economic condition, are to be applauded. Accepting that you have an illness is the first step in overcoming it. The next step is constructive action -- the task to which the Administration and Congress must now turn.

DATELINE: PYONGYANG, North Korea, Dec. 19

 BODY:
Revolutionary slogans are strung across drab office buildings and apartments. Loudspeakers exhort workers with picks and shovels at construction sites to toil for the glory of President Kim Il Sung. Statues and pictures of the "Great Leader" beckon everywhere.
North Korea is the land that the 1990's forgot. Seemingly immune to the historic forces toppling or weakening Communist systems throughout the world, officials here speak of "mistakes" made by other Communist governments that they can avoid. 
 "We know about the changes in the world, but they have not affected us," said Li Song Chol, a 28-year-old runner studying to be an athletic coach. "We Koreans have built our own socialist economy. We believe in ourselves. We have chosen our own system. Our faith will not be shaken."
 
Questioning U.S. Pressure
 Mr. Li was sitting in the dim recesses of a nightclub for the city's elite, where he and a group of male friends were having a night off from their wives. Around them were fountains, rock formations and colored lights making the club look like a honky-tonk grotto.
As is the custom in this prim society, the men danced with one another. But Mr. Li stayed behind to make a new point about the main topic in the news these days: American pressure on North Korea to stop developing a nuclear bomb.
"We don't believe we have nuclear weapons," he said firmly. "We have no ability to make them. Why are you Americans putting such pressure on us? It is very dangerous to world peace."
 
Following the 'Great Leader'
 Outside of North Korea, one of the most closed societies on earth, experts speak of a nation gripped by crises: a stricken economy, poor harvests, food and fuel shortages, declining industry and an oppressive government.
Human rights groups speak of a smothering totalitarian environment. North Korea's people are said to be indoctrinated from early childhood to follow the Great Leader, and his son and successor, Kim Jong Il, the "Dear Leader," and to espouse the doctrine of juche, or self-sufficiency.
Because Mr. Li and the others spoke through a Government-supplied interpreter, who presumably reported on what he heard, there was no way to know to what degree the interpreter's presence inhibited the expression of their true feelings. But here in Pyongyang, random conversations over a day and a half revealed only the mildest signs of distress, and there are no discernible signs of dissent. Indeed, the uniformity of political opinions makes it appear that Pyongyang is a city for the loyal elite, who are well treated.
The streets are crowded but not congested with cars. Pedestrians cram into buses, subways and trams. Stores downtown carry a variety of goods, though hardly in much abundance.
On the subway, two young women who said they were off to buy flowers to place at the Revolutionary Martyrs' Tombs had nothing but compliments for the subway, with its gleaming vaulted ceilings, colored chandeliers, mosaic friezes and piped in music.
"As far as we know, there are no unemployed people in our country," said Pak Il Hwa, a 25-year-old bookkeeper for the municipal bus system.
People said that rice was rationed and that they faced delays in getting meat, dairy products and such household goods as soap and drugs. A housewife said her family ate three meals a day but meat only once or twice a month.
"Koreans are not people who like to eat meat," said Ryu Chun Sim, who was buying pencils for her children to use for homework, adding cheerfully that she liked the fact that prices were the same everywhere, even in remote areas. "Articles are supplied in a planned way," she said.
 
Patriotism and Red Pins
 At nearby counters of the five-story Pyongyang Department Store No. 1, the counters and display racks were packed with goods, some of them expensive. A man's suit cost $125 -- two month's salary, a guide explained. In the store, which was unheated, all the shoppers wore little red pins featuring President Kim. The guide said that although wearing such pins is voluntary, everyone wishes to show their patriotism.
Mrs. Ryu said she was proud to be a member of the Workers' Party and was aware of recent developments regarding North Korea, including the recent signing of a treaty with South Korea.
"The agreement was a great event for us," she said. "We consider it a first step toward achieving unification. But now the implementation may bring some problems. You Americans can help us by persuading your Government to withdraw nuclear weapons in South Korea."
The fact that President Roh Tae Woo had announced this week that South Korea had been made nuclear free was not publicized here.
 
Monuments to Kim
 Pyongyang has had two bursts of construction. In 1982, in honor of the President's 70th birthday, the city put up an immense Arch of Triumph, a 60-foot bronze statue of the Great Leader and a huge obelisk with a red torch-like set of lights on top.
Then in 1988, the nation completed a vast complex of stadiums, rinks and amphitheaters in the hope of becoming co-host of the Seoul Olympics. Spurned by the Olympic Committee, North Korea held its own huge Youth Festival in 1989 and finished a vast stretch of 20-story apartment complexes nearby.
What the citizenry truly thinks of these granite and marble edifices at a time when North Korea has defaulted on its external debt is impossible to say. But what may have been a note of dark humor crept into one man's comment on the 105-story structure for a hotel that remains uncompleted after years of delay.
"It is the will of the people to build such a big hotel," he said, shaking his head. Seeing a foreigner share in the skepticism, he quickly added that although North Korea had been belittled before in its ambitions, the country would prove its critics wrong again with this hotel, 5 fewer stories than the towers of the World Trade Center in Manhattan.
 
Birthday Apartments
 This year, yet another new construction enterprise is under way, this time in honor of President Kim's 80th birthday next April. In the southern part of the city, another vast complex of 50,000 new apartments is going up. The site is filled with workers tramping through the mud and being exhorted by martial music and a voice shouting over a loudspeaker such things as: "We must manage our economy in our own way following the instructions of President Kim Il Sung!"
The workers had few bulldozers or cranes, and were joined by battalions of army troops brought in to speed things up. A guide was asked why, if everything was so wonderful in North Korea, there was a need to harangue workers with such propoganda.
"We need it to mobilize the people in a proper way," he said. "It makes people work harder in a creative way."
 
Sports and the Party Line
 There seem to be plenty of diversions for the people of Pyongyang. There are public baths where men can relax and get a massage and an enormous array of sites for sports. At the city's big ice rink, a group of high school speed-skating teams were competing as a small crowd shouted. Two huge "Children's Palaces" -- closed this winter, perhaps because of fuel shortages -- house dozens of rooms for after-school studies and such activities as singing, dancing, painting and music making.
A group of high school students wandering the streets in the evening explained that they had been studying the revolutionary teachings of President Kim since the age of 6 or 7. At least, they said, the high school course on these teachings was an easy one, since they had been exposed to it all their lives.
One thing missing from the streets of Pyongyang has been bicycles. Outsiders and defectors say the Government does not permit bicycles because they give too much mobility to the people. But a few bicycles are now being allowed in North Korea, a stunning contrast to the bicycle-filled streets of China.
In their casual comments, the people here speak of a society under siege and threat by the United States and its nuclear weapons, suffering under economic pressures but determined to go their own way.
 
Linking Peace and Business
 While not wanting to admit that the system has failed, people here acknowledge that things could be better if there is a rapprochement with Seoul or Washington. "If we have peace, then business can improve," said a businessman aboard a flight from Beijing to Pyongyang.
With a briefcase loaded with imported chocolates and a bag stuffed with bottles of cognac, the businessman said opportunities were growing for North Korea to sell gold, silver and precious and non-ferrous metals abroad, especially to Japan. But everything else reminds the North Koreans of the evils of capitalism.
Even an English lesson on the radio reinforced the message, offering these as sample sentences for listeners: "I made some bad investments and it looks like I may go broke." "My brother's company went broke last May." "She is so extravagant. No wonder she is broke."

HEADLINE: Experts Doubt Cutbacks Alone Will Save G.M.

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Dec. 22

 BODY:
When the General Motors Corporation announced last week that it was closing 21 plants and shedding 74,000 workers in the next three years, its chairman, Robert C. Stempel, said the changes would enable the world's largest auto maker to "meet the competitive challenges of the 1990's."
But many experts are not so sure that G.M. can halt its inexorable decline just by getting smaller. 
 Time and again in the last decade, G.M. has closed plants and laid off workers, each time proclaiming that a "leaner and meaner" company was ready to take on the world. G.M., the experts say, needs more than a trimmer waist; it needs a change of mentality.
 
A Repeat Ahead?
 "What they've announced doesn't answer the interesting question," said James Womack, an automotive industry consultant. "G.M. is going to get smaller, but will there be a similar event four years from now?"
The changes announced Wednesday, which will cut G.M.'s North American work force by 18 percent, should help staunch the horrendous losses in the company's North American operations, which have reached $15 million a day in the last year. But the company's waning financial state has hurt its chances for recovery.
The plight of General Motors -- and of the nation's No. 2 and No. 3 auto makers, Ford Motor and Chrysler -- is a vivid symbol of the nation's struggling manufacturing base.
 
Victim of Success
 Forty-five years ago, Peter Drucker, now a professor of social sciences at the Claremont Graduate School in California, extolled G.M. as the epitome of a successful corporation. Now, he says, it has become "a victim of its own success," unable to break with managerial habits that are outmoded.
Why, for example, does G.M. insist on retaining its five car divisions -- Cadillac, Buick, Oldsmobile, Pontiac and Chevrolet? Fifteen years ago, they were marketed to different socioeconomic segments. Now most people's choice of vehicle reflects "life style" rather than just their pocketbooks. Chrysler's Jeeps and mini-vans, for example, are bought by people of many different economic backgrounds.
The five divisions require separate design departments, marketing and advertising campaigns and dealer networks, which all contribute to the bloat at G.M., which has more white-collar workers in North America than the Toyota Motor Corporation has workers of all kinds in the world. Mr. Stempel said Wednesday, when the huge cutbacks were announced, that the five divisions would be retained.
In recent years, G.M. has been trying to forge new and better relationships with suppliers, dealers and employees. Its goals are to develop models more quickly and to manufacture them more efficiently, hoping to lure back the millions of customers who have defected to foreign brands.
But there are formidable roadblocks: G.M.'s institutional resistance to change, its enormous bulk and an outdated management style that controls rather than delegates.
Ford and Chrysler are also altering their management styles. But having slimmed down during their financial troubles in the early 1980's, they are not so bloated with overcapacity or as inefficient as G.M. Each G.M. worker, for example, produces about 13 cars a year, compared with 45 a year at Toyota.
And almost anyone who has dealt with "the General," as G.M. is known in the auto industry, can offer an anecdote about its sometimes overbearing, sometimes rigid management style.
One supplier rolled his eyes as he described efforts to trim G.M.'s costs -- which failed inside G.M.'s bureaucracy. An engineer moaned about endless meetings, mountains of paperwork and vicious office politics. A Chevrolet dealer complained that his telephone calls to divisional headquarters were not returned.
This is not to say General Motors is not trying. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of consultants have been hired to hold seminars explaining the importance of change and how to accomplish it. Top executives have participated in sensitivity training.
Now, management experts say, as white-collar employment shrinks in the next three years, G.M. must learn to eliminate redundant or irrelevant activities. It must hold fewer meetings, ask that fewer forms be filled out, impose fewer controls on supervisors -- instead of just reducing its headcount.
G.M.'s top-heaviness has a direct impact on manufacturing efficiency, which becomes strikingly clear to anyone who strolls through the Honda Motor Company's plant in Marysville, Ohio, as well as through G.M.'s plants and offices.
Honda's top manufacturing executive, for example, is dressed in overalls, often greasy; has a desk in a room with 40 other engineers and often works near the assembly line. G.M.'s manufacturing executives wear expensive suits and spend most of their time in nicely decorated offices and meeting rooms.
 
Stumbling Block for Supervisors
 Some old-line American manufacturers have been able to nurture a new culture in their operations, but only through radical action. Dennis J. Gormley, chief executive of the Federal-Mogul Corporation of Southfield, Mich., which makes bearings and other engine parts, discovered that production-line workers were eager to accept more responsibility, but some of their supervisors got in the way.
In the last two years, Mr. Gormley said, he has replaced the plant managers in 80 percent of his company's 20 American factories because they could not or would not cede responsibility to subordinates.
In most G.M. plants, hourly workers have been pushed to become more involved in quality control, designing parts and dealing with suppliers. But many managers, who roam the plants in white shirts and ties, still impose too much authority, and G.M. has been slow to weed them out.
 
Workers Feel Betrayed
 What will make matters more difficult now is that many G.M. workers feel betrayed and threatened. They live with an ax dangling over their heads, because the company said it would eliminate 74,000 jobs but did not identify which ones, or where. At least a third of those cuts are expected to come within the salaried ranks.
When General Motors began its innovative Saturn project in 1985, it said the attempt to embrace the ideas of worker empowerment and greater participation by dealers and suppliers would eventually become a model for the parent company. But the plant in Spring Hill, Tenn., has started slowly, and its influence within G.M. remains minuscule, compared with that of Chevrolet, Pontiac, Buick, Oldsmobile or Cadillac.
Motivated workers and flexible factories can yield enormous gains in marketing. The best Japanese car makers are able to make a profit with far fewer sales of a specific model than G.M., partly because their engineers and factory workers can set up machines faster, solve glitches without supervision and keep the cost of model changes low.
Because model changes cost them more, G.M. and other American companies must build hundreds of thousands or millions of a given model to break even. And to sell hundreds of thousands of cars of one model, say a Chevrolet Caprice, the company chooses a bland design.
 
Motivating Individual Workers
 Professor Drucker warned G.M. as far back as the 1940's that it was doomed eventually unless ordinary workers somehow could be motivated to contribute more than physical or menial labor. At about the same time, W. Edwards Deming, an influential consultant and statistician, was helping Toyota ignite a manufacturing revolution that today is sweeping factories around the world.
The revolution has not yet set G.M. on fire, and many people who follow the auto industry think perhaps it never will.
