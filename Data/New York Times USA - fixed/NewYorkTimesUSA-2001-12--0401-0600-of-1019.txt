HEADLINE: Prices of Imports Are Down, As Is U.S. Appetite for Imports 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 12 

 BODY:
Prices of imported goods fell more than expected in November, the government reported today, signaling that inflation does not yet pose a threat to economic recovery.
 The import price index dropped 1.6 percent after a record 2.4 percent decline in October, the Labor Department said. Excluding petroleum, prices paid for finished goods and raw materials from abroad fell 0.6 percent, the same as in October. 
 "Inflation is down and out for the foreseeable future," said Joshua Shapiro, the chief economist at Maria Fiorini Ramirez Inc. in New York. "That reflects excess capacity around the world."
A separate report showed that the current account deficit, the broadest measure of international trade because it includes investments, narrowed to $95 billion in the third quarter as the recession curtailed Americans' appetite for imports.
The gap shrank in the July-September period after contracting to $107.6 billion in the second quarter, the Commerce Department said. The decrease, which left the deficit below $100 billion for the first time in almost two years, resulted in part from a surge in insurance payments after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
The current account deficit represents money that the United States has to borrow overseas to pay for all the goods and services Americans import and to finance investment not covered by American savings.
The import prices index is the first of three measures of inflation for November. The Labor Department will report on producer prices on Thursday and on consumer prices on Friday.
Import prices have fallen 8.9 percent since November 2000, compared with a 4.6 percent increase in the previous 12 months. Excluding petroleum, import prices have declined 3.6 percent over the last year, compared with a 0.5 percent increase for the 12 months ended in November 2000.
Analysts had expected a decline of 1.3 percent from October to November in the import price index. Imports account for about a third of all goods bought in the United States.
The price of petroleum and related products fell 10.8 percent in November and has fallen 41 percent since last year, reflecting slower demand in a cooler economy and less travel since Sept. 11. Natural gas prices fell 6.3 percent last month after falling 16 percent in October as warm weather crimped demand for heating fuel.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
BargainHunters to the Rescue After a Day of Price Dips

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Buyers still worried about the economy but unable to resist bargain prices went back to Wall Street late in yesterday's session, giving stocks some modest, hard-fought gains.
 Investors overcame their misgivings about earnings warnings from Merck and American Express that had sent prices falling for much of the day. 
 "There is a big desire to get money back to work" on daily weakness, "which is why the bouts of profit taking have been limited," said Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Ltd. "Money wants to get into stocks." 
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 6.44 points, or nearly 0.1 percent, at 9,894.81, after falling as much as 81 points earlier.
The broader market followed the same path, recovering from losses in the last 30 minutes of trading. The Nasdaq composite index closed at 2,011.38, up 9.45 points, or 0.5 percent, after having lost 26 points earlier. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index inched up 0.31, to 1,137.07, recovering from an earlier 10-point loss.
Analysts were unfazed by the selling that persisted for most of the session.
"The stock market has moved up too far, too fast," said Alan Ackerman, executive vice president of Fahnestock & Company. "And stocks are having a tough time holding those levels without strong earnings to support them."
The Dow is 20.1 percent above its low for the year, 8,235.81, which occurred on Sept. 21, in the aftermath of the terror attacks. The Nasdaq is up 41.3 percent from its low; the S.& P. is up 17.7 percent. The market's post-attack comeback is more important than occasional downturns and profit taking, analysts said.
"To come back from that kind of hit is a Herculean feat, and basically states there will be an economic recovery next year," Mr. Bleier said.
The market had two reasons for not trading even higher near the close yesterday: Merck and American Express, both Dow industrial stocks.
Merck fell $2.18, to $58.52, having on Tuesday projected no growth in earnings per share next year, mainly because of the expiration of the patent on its key ulcer drug, Prilosec.
American Express declined 84 cents, to $33.42, after warning yesterday of weaker profits in the fourth quarter and announcing 5,500 to 6,500 job cuts.
The market drew some strength from a positive outlook from another Dow industrial, Procter & Gamble. P.& G. soared $3.25, to $79.95, after an announcement on Tuesday that it expected to beat analysts' earnings estimates for the current quarter by 2 to 3 cents a share.
But much of the market's late-day jump came from the technology sector, which has suffered the most from the economic slump and which many analysts have predicted will ultimately lead the market higher. I.B.M. rose $1.70, to $123.20, and Intel climbed 89 cents, to $34.08.

Treasury Prices Gain
 (By Bloomberg News) -- Treasury bond prices rose yesterday for a third day after a firm of investment consultants said the Bush administration would support Japan's buying of United States bonds.
Investors bought Treasuries because Japan's purchase of the securities would add to demand, helping drive up their prices.
The investment consultants, Medley Global Advisors, said the United States would back Japan's buying of the debt as part of the country's effort to weaken its currency, Dow Jones Newswires reported.
The 10-year Treasury note rose 14/32, to a price of 100. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5 percent from 5.06 percent on Tuesday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 30/32, to 98 19/32. The bond's yield fell to 5.47 percent from 5.54 percent on Tuesday.

LOAD-DATE: December 13, 2001 TDana Hannon, 29, wanted to be a firefighter for almost as long as he wanted to hunt. After high school, he worked as a carpenter to support himself while he served as a volunteer firefighter in his hometown, Wyckoff, N.J., where he rose to the rank of captain. He got his first paying job as a firefighter in Bridgeport, Conn., where he was awarded the medal of valor for a rescue. Seven years after taking the exam, he joined the Fire Department of New York. He was with Engine Company 26."He was the best brother anybody could ask for," said his sister, Kyle. "Just the right mix of friend and tormentor." THOMAS P. DeANGELISIn the Thick of ThingsFive years ago, when Thomas P. DeAngelis was promoted to battalion chief in the New York City Fire Department, his wife, Patty, told him: "You've been running into burning buildings for 22 years. But you're a battalion chief now, so you won't have to do that anymore."In her heart, she knew better. Tommy DeAngelis would never send a firefighter into a building he had not personally entered and checked out. Around the East 51st Street firehouse in Manhattan, he was known as "Chuckles" because of his sunny good humor and his lust for life: sports, cooking, sailing, carpentry, writing. But when the alarm sounded, he would suddenly become all business.Sometimes he would kick around the idea of retiring in a year or two -- he was 51 -- maybe to take up writing children's books. But, again, Mrs. DeAngelis knew better. "He loved being a firefighter way too much to ever quit early," she said.On Monday, Sept. 10, she had lunch with him at their home in Westbury, on Long Island, before he headed into Manhattan to pull a 24-hour shift. "See you Tuesday night," she said as he left, giving him a kiss. "Be careful." ALEXIS LEDUCA Born FatherSome people are made to be fathers. Alexis Leduc, a maintenance supervisor for Franklin Templeton on the 97th floor of 2 World Trade Center, was like that. He and his wife, Isa, had Adolfo, 23; Cindy, 21; Elvis, 21; and Alexia, 10.Then there were the neighborhood children in the Bronx that Mr. Leduc, 45, was father to. Eddie and Freddie Perez across the street have nice parents, but sometimes when they were younger it was easier for them to discuss things with an outsider. And there is another Elvis, also 21. Elvis Castillo has a good mother, but got into trouble and went to jail. After he was released, he asked to live with the Leducs. He has no siblings, his mother works all day, and the Leduc children are close to him in age. Mr. Leduc made a deal with him: Elvis could stay, if he got a job and helped himself. He found a job, and has lived there since.Mr. Leduc's other great love went right along with being a father. He collected toys. "He was a big kid when it came to Christmas," Mrs. Leduc said. He grew up poor in Puerto Rico and had few toys. When he died, he left behind 100 Spawn figures, 500 toys from McDonald's, 500 toy antique cars, and thousands of baseball cards. JOSHUA ARONReveled in Life's DetailsAt age 7, Joshua Aron would sit at the kitchen table bent over a copy of The Wall Street Journal, analyzing the stock tables with his chocolate milk. "I explained what makes it go up and down," said his mother, Ruth Aron. "He loved to do puzzles, and to him it was just another puzzle."Fast forward two decades. Mr. Aron was an equities trader at Cantor Fitzgerald, facing a bank of computer screens. When there was a break in the action, he sent love notes to his wife, Rachel, by instant messenger. "We were best friends," Mrs. Aron said. "Everything just came naturally."Mr. Aron's intense, childlike enthusiasm made him a blur of activity in the kitchen, on a bike, or researching new fascinations on the Internet. He delighted in life's details, repainting his Upper West Side apartment, installing a 200-bottle wine closet and a 90-inch projection-screen television.Even in the high-stakes world of finance, Mr. Aron, 29, remained playful, quoting liberally from Austin Powers movies ("Would they be ill-tempered sea bass?"). If Mrs. Aron was upset, he would cheer her up by promising to help get back at her tormentors. "You want to get 'em?" he would ask with mock intensity. "Come on, let's get 'em right now." BRIAN NOVOTNYRomantic TouchesBrian Novotny first glimpsed Theresa Thomas as he and some Cantor Fitzgerald clients were leaving the Monkey Bar on the East Side of Manhattan. He shook their hands, said goodnight and made a beeline back inside.Ms. Thomas, visiting from Los Angeles for the weekend, had been in New York less than an hour when she noticed a tall, soft-eyed young man smiling at her. Soon they were deep in conversation. "The chemistry was very strong -- no question," she said. "When you have that chemistry, it's unavoidable." Two years ago, after numerous cross-country visits, she moved to New York, and fell more in love with Mr. Novotny, 33, than ever. One day she remarked of the weather, "It's getting hot," and returned home the next day to find a new air-conditioner humming in her apartment. Feeling out of sorts while vacationing, she comforted herself with a long bath -- and emerged to a room filled with candles and soft jazz.But then, this was a man who surprised his parents by painting the entire exterior of their house while they were away for the weekend.A week before Sept. 11, Theresa Thomas and Brian Novotny were engaged. For a few days, the future seemed to unfold joyously before them.JOANN TABEEKTough Cookie, Soft HeartJoAnn Tabeek worked in the World Trade Center for more than 20 years, always for Cantor Fitzgerald. "She was dedicated to her job," said Vincent Milotta, Ms. Tabeek's fiance. "But she wanted to get out and retire in three years. We had already gone to Florida to look around for a place."When she wasn't working, Ms. Tabeek, who was 41, spent time with Krystal, her 11-year-old daughter from her first marriage. She liked to shop for clothes. Often, on weekends when Krystal was with her father, Ms. Tabeek and Mr. Milotta would motor to Atlantic City. "We liked to go down and see a show and eat," he said. "We liked being together."At work, Ms. Tabeek was all business. But appearances often deceive."The first impression was of one tough cookie," said Jennifer Megna, a friend and former co-worker at Cantor Fitzgerald. "But once you got to know her she would give you her heart. You could call at 3 or 4 in the morning and talk to her for hours."On Sept. 13, Ms. Tabeek's body was found, one of only seven to be recovered thus far from Cantor's offices."I have her engagement ring around my neck," Mr. Milotta said. "She is with me all the time."December 16, 2001

HEADLINE: Film Directors' Union Reaches Tentative Contract Agreement 

BYLINE:  By RICK LYMAN 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 12 

 BODY:
The union representing Hollywood's film and television directors reached a tentative agreement on a three-year contract today with negotiators for the leading studios, networks and production companies, with many of the provisions mirroring agreements reached earlier in the year with actors and writers.
 "Given our industry's -- and our country's -- current economic climate, everyone at the table recognized the importance of reaching an agreement without the disruption of production that inevitably comes in the months immediately preceding the expiration of a contract," said Gil Cates, chairman of the negotiating committee for the Directors Guild of America. 
 In fact, film production in Hollywood has been in a serious slump since early summer. Fearing strikes by the industry's writers and actors, whose contracts expired in May and June, studios had accelerated their production schedules in the first half of the year. 
When the writers and actors agreed to contracts, however, the studios found themselves with so many films stockpiled that they did not need to increase production immediately. Then, the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks caused the slump to continue through the fall as many producers worried about what sorts of movies would interest audiences after the attacks. 
Mr. Cates said that the union had been able to incorporate into the agreement the gains made by writers and actors, like improvements in residual payments, as well as some additional provisions that were specific to directors' situations. For the first time, directors of feature films will be guaranteed a bonus payment should someone make a sequel to one of their movies.
The agreement also expands the contract language to include new digital technologies, requiring that all prime-time dramatic programming be covered no matter the medium on which it was shot. 
The tentative agreement will be submitted to the guild's national board at its regular meeting on Saturday. If approved, the guild's membership will vote on final ratification.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
To avoid terrorism, end poverty and ignorance. Right? Guess again. Debunking conventional wisdom about the roots of hate crime.

BYLINE:  By Alan B. Krueger; Alan B. Krueger is the Bendheim Professor of Economics and Public Affairs at Princeton University and editor of The Journal of Economic Perspectives. E-mail: akrueger@princeton.edu.

 BODY:
HARDLY a day goes by without an expert proposing more foreign aid or support for education as a cure for terrorism. There are compelling reasons for improving the living standards and education of people in developing countries, but is reducing terrorism one of them?
 Available evidence from a close cousin to terrorism -- violent crimes against religious, racial or ethnic groups -- yields surprisingly little support for a connection between material well-being or education and hate crimes. 
 Until recently, social scientists thought economic deprivation was a crucial determinant of such crimes. The logic is obvious: the most disadvantaged have the least to lose (especially in suicide attacks), and minority groups are a convenient scapegoat in times of trouble. 
The empirical support stemmed mainly from historical evidence on lynchings of blacks in the South. In 1940, the psychologists Carl Hovland and Robert Sears reported a correlation between the value of an acre of cotton and the number of lynchings, using data from 1882 to 1930. As economic conditions improved, lynchings fell.
But a careful study by Donald Green, Jack Glaser and Andrew Rich of Yale, published in The Journal of Personality and Social Psychology in 1998, showed that this correlation vanished when pre-existing trends were taken into account. That is, apart from the long-term tendency for the number of lynchings to decline and the economy to grow, lynchings were unrelated to year-to-year economic changes. More important, when they examined additional years of data, they discovered that lynchings did not rise during the Great Depression.
The evidence of a connection in contemporary events is also elusive. Professors Green, Glaser and Rich studied the incidence of hate crimes against blacks, Jews, Asians and gay men and lesbians in New York City each month from 1987 to 1995. They found that the incidence of such crimes was unrelated to the city's unemployment rate.
The United States does not appear to be unique. Germany experienced a rash of organized violence against foreigners in the early 1990's. Unemployment was high, particularly in the former East Germany. Yet in a study published in The Journal of Human Resources, Jorn-Steffen Pischke and I found no relationship between the unemployment rate and the incidence of ethnic violence across counties in Germany. Likewise, average education was unrelated to the amount of violence against foreigners.
Neither cyclical downturns nor longer-term disparities in living standards appear to be correlated with a wide range of hate crimes.
This is not proof of the absence of a causal relationship, but any causal effect of economic conditions is likely to be complex, indirect and weak. If there was a direct effect, one would expect hate crimes to rise during periods of economic hardship.
But do the findings from these studies apply to terrorism, particularly for the poverty-stricken and poorly educated populations in the Middle East? Hate crimes could be spawned by different conditions from those that are responsible for politically motivated attacks.
The fragmentary evidence on terrorists, however, suggests that the common stereotype that they come from the ranks of the most uneducated and economically deprived is a myth.
From 1996 to 1999, Nasra Hassan, a United Nations relief worker, interviewed nearly 250 people involved in suicide attacks, including failed bombers, families of deceased bombers and trainers. Her conclusion, as reported in The New Yorker: "None of them were uneducated, desperately poor, simple-minded or depressed."
Professor Ariel Merari, director of the Political Violence Research Center at Tel Aviv University, concurred: "All information that I have also indicates that there is no connection between socioeconomic indicators and involvement in militant/terrorist activity in general and in suicide attacks in particular, at least as much as the Palestinian case is concerned."
The profile of the 19 terrorists who carried out the Sept. 11 attacks -- many of whom were college-educated and from middle-class families -- may not be so atypical after all.
Another fragment of evidence is that the average illiteracy rate of men in the seven countries the State Department designated as sponsors of terrorism (Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan and Syria) is 17 percent -- about the same as the worldwide illiteracy rate. Ireland and Spain, which have struggled with terrorism for years, are neither poor nor neglectful of education.
The impact of education on international terrorism is undoubtedly complicated. Certainly, terrorists with global reach are likely to be drawn from the ranks of the educated and relatively well off, so they can blend into their new environs. Schools might be preaching hatred instead of peace and harmony, as Thomas L. Friedman has argued in The New York Times.
A country's economic development may influence terrorism and political violence in another way: by affecting the likelihood of civil war.
A new study by James Fearon and David Laitin, political scientists at Stanford, finds that nations with a lower per-capita level of gross domestic product are more likely to undergo a civil war. In fact, economic development is a far more important predictor of civil wars than is whether a nation's population is fragmented along religious or ethnic lines. Mr. Fearon and Mr. Laitin highlight the role of "insurgency" as a cause of civil war: weak states are unable to suppress insurgents intent on waging a civil war. The governments in poor countries lack the means, skills and knowledge to thwart rebellions. In addition, they argue, it is easier for insurgents to recruit foot soldiers where poverty is high.
Why might economic development affect civil wars and terrorism differently? Mr. Fearon suggested: "You get terrorism when the state is strong and competent enough to prevent the initial attacks of would-be rebel leaders from escalating into a big civil war (e.g., Northern Ireland, the Basque region in Spain, the Red Brigade in Italy). Income, we argue, is a measure of such capabilities."
So a Marshall Plan to aid economic growth may lead to greater stability. Moreover, fostering development would alleviate much suffering, and promoting education would generate many benefits, including improved health, faster economic growth and participation of the disenfranchised in modern society. Alas, there is little ground for optimism that such worthy assistance would greatly reduce international terrorism.

HEADLINE: Top Democrats Feud Over Bill to Aid Camden 

BYLINE:  By IVER PETERSON 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Dec. 12 

 BODY:
Some South Jersey leaders said today that their fellow Democrat, Governor-elect James E. McGreevey, had angered them by trying to kill a $180 million spending plan to improve Camden.
 Without directly saying that he wanted the long-debated measure to die with the current Legislature next month, the governor-elect said today in an interview, "Considering the $1.9 billion budget shortfall, it is incumbent upon the State Legislature and the state government to stop all discretionary spending." 
The Camden measure is sponsored by State Senator Wayne R. Bryant of Camden, who used harsh language to attack his fellow Democrat, accusing Mr. McGreevey of failing to grasp the depth of Camden's desperation, and of favoring North Jersey aid projects over those in the south. 
Senator Bryant said the governor-elect had told him he favored the kind of programs that the state had used in Atlantic City and other cities: a special taxing district, abatements and other lures for private investment. Senator Bryant's measure would commit the state to spend $180 million to hire more police officers, build new housing and sewers and make other capital improvements. In addition, it would install a state-appointed chief executive with veto powers over the City Council, in effect controlling the city's finances. Mr. McGreevey approves of the state controls but not the $180 million.
"He said we should do like we did in Atlantic City," Senator Bryant recalled. "I said, 'Give me $12 billion in ratables like Atlantic City and I won't need anything else.' The point is that Camden is completely different from anyplace else. It has no boots, it has no bootstraps, it has no socks. It has nothing to work from."
Mr. Bryant's bill has passed the State Senate and is scheduled for a vote in the Assembly on Dec. 20. It was not clear today whether the Democratic minority would obey the governor-elect's wishes or vote with the Republican majority and saddle Mr. McGreevey with spending he says he cannot afford.
There was talk among some Democrats this week that they might agree to postpone the Camden measure if the Legislature also shelved Acting Gov. Donald T. DiFrancesco's proposal to build a new sports arena in Newark. Mr. McGreevey declined to say what he had told Democratic leaders in the Assembly, or what they had told him. 
"My personal conversations are personal," he said.
The arena does not require direct state spending, but relies on a combination of local and private spending, and on the creation of a special taxing district. But the bill to create the so-called tax increment district has become encrusted with appropriations for other sports facilities in other parts of the state, particularly in South Jersey, the home of the departing speaker, Jack Collins.
Mr. McGreevey said today, as he has in the past, that he was in favor of the Newark arena, but not the other projects that had become attached to the legislation.
"I am strongly and unequivocally committed to the redevelopment of our urban centers and I have been for the last two years," Mr. McGreevey said. "There is a strong argument for a tax increment financing district as proposed for the Newark arena to spur economic growth without direct state expenditures. But attached to the tax increment financing district were certain special projects -- certain Christmas tree items -- and any bill with that kind of pork can't be kosher."

HEADLINE: St. Paul Cos. Exits Medical Malpractice Insurance 

BYLINE:  By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
Because of heavy losses, the St. Paul Companies will exit the medical malpractice insurance business, ending coverage for 750 hospitals, 42,000 physicians and 73,000 other health care workers nationwide, the company said yesterday. 
 St. Paul said its losses had mounted despite average increases of 24 percent in its malpractice rates in more than 25 states, some of the highest increases since the mid-1980's. Fueled by resentments against managed care, jury awards against doctors and hospitals now average $3.49 million each, according to Jury Verdict Research of Horsham, Pa. 
The increases in malpractice premiums are passed on to employers and consumers, now adding about one percentage point to double-digit health care inflation, analysts say.
St. Paul, the nation's fourth-largest business insurer, said it was facing losses on its malpractice business of $940 million this year. Premiums were $500 million. The company also had $941 million in losses from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. After the attacks, reinsurance companies raised charges to insurance companies, compounding their problems.
Staying in the malpractice business "would threaten the solvency of the company," said Jay Fishman, the chairman and chief executive of St. Paul, who was hired in October from Citigroup's insurance units.
St. Paul said it would take a $900 million pretax charge in the fourth quarter. It will add $600 million to reserves for pending malpractice claims and $150 million to other reserves, including $75 million for Sept. 11 claims. It will also take a charge for $150 million in costs related to good will and severance.
Mark Hamel, a spokesman for the company, said St. Paul's withdrawal from malpractice coverage would take two years to complete under varying state rules.
Carol Brierly Golin, editor of the Medical Liability Monitor, an industry newsletter, said St. Paul had been reducing coverage for more than a year for high-risk specialists like obstetricians, gynecologists and emergency room doctors. 
Malpractice insurance is a hot issue in West Virginia, where St. Paul tried to withdraw but was blocked by state officials, and in Pennsylvania.
Pennsylvania regulators took over one of the largest hospital malpractice insurers, Phico, when claims threatened to exceed its ability to pay. A Pennsylvania backup fund for catastrophic insurance claims is "$2 billion in the hole," Ms. Brierly Golin said, and doctors are paying heavy assessments to bail it out.
New York, where malpractice rates are among the nation's highest, "has been able to hold the line" on further increases, said Donald J. Fager, vice president of Medical Liability Mutual Insurance, the nation's largest malpractice insurer. Malpractice rates in the state are set by the insurance superintendent, he noted, and the company's actuaries had built large reserves, although these are now dwindling.
Mutual companies owned by doctors and hospitals, like Medical Liability Mutual, have about 60 percent of the national malpractice business. St. Paul had less than 10 percent, Mr. Hamel said. 
Dr. Donald J. Palmisano, secretary-treasurer of the American Medical Association, said the St. Paul announcement bolstered the association's arguments for laws to limit jury awards in malpractice cases. "Because of the sky-high cost of professional liability insurance, physicians are closing or limiting their practices" or going without insurance, he said.
Shares of St. Paul fell $1, to $46.38. Standard & Poor's reduced the company's senior debt rating to A-.

Drop in Gifts to Muslim Charities Is Attributed to U.S. Scrutiny

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 12 

 BODY:
The government's scrutiny of Muslim charities in the United States since the Sept. 11 attacks has contributed heavily to a sharp drop in donations to those groups, many relief organizations say.
 Donations to Muslim charities in the United States during the month of Ramadan are down by more than 50 percent from the period last year, the organizations report. 
 Muslims are required by their faith to give 2.5 percent of their annual income to charity, called zakat, and often do so at Ramadan, when donations are believed to receive extra religious merit. Muslim relief groups rely heavily on the generosity of Muslims during the holy month -- which began Nov. 16 and is to end this weekend -- to meet much of their yearly fund-raising needs. 
But as federal authorities continue to investigate Muslim charities for possible links with terrorism, American Muslims are withholding contributions, charity officials said, worried that their donations may draw suspicion from the government.
"People are fearful," said Muhammad Rahman, executive director for social service and relief at the Islamic Circle of North America in Queens. "They don't know what organization to give to, or trust."
In 2000, Mr. Rahman helped solicit $1.5 million from private and corporate sponsors during Ramadan, which was used for projects at home and abroad. This year, he said, less than $500,000 has found its way into his group's coffers. While the downturn in the economy may factor into the decline, Mr. Rahman said, it alone could not account for the substantial drop. 
The result, community leaders say, is that international relief efforts could suffer as many Muslims choose to give their dollars locally in support of charities they feel will avoid scrutiny.
Omar Saleem Abu-Namous, head imam at the Islamic Cultural Center in New York, said that "the United States has shut the door" on international charities. 
Instead, he said, American Muslims were "giving to the mosques, the schools, the Islamic centers" in their communities. 
Since the Sept. 11 attacks, the Bush administration has moved to block the assets of 153 individuals, organizations, and entities, including charities, believed to have connections to terrorist groups, a Treasury Department spokesman said. 
Last week, offices of the Holy Land Foundation, a Muslim charity based in Richardson, Tex., were shuttered, and its assets frozen. The United States and Israel have long accused the foundation of financing activities of the Hamas terrorist group. 
The White House continues to pledge support for Muslim charities, insisting that the war on terrorism is not a war on Islam, or Muslims.
"The president would hope that donations will continue to all charities that do good works," Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman, said today. "That, of course, includes Muslim charities."
Still, many Muslims are rethinking their charitable giving. 
"Muslims feel, across the board, that they do not want to invite scrutiny into their giving," said Sohail Mohammed, an immigration lawyer in Clifton, N.J., and general counsel to the American-Muslim Union of New Jersey. 
A Bush administration official said tonight that Muslims who donated to charities like the Holy Land Foundation without knowledge of the group's activities would be wrong to assume they were putting themselves at risk. 
"The donors are not targets," the official said, "and should not expect a federal agent at their doorsteps."
Just the same, to fulfill his philanthropic obligation this year, Mr. Mohammed said, he opted to make donations to charities supporting children who lost parents in the World Trade Center attack.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE INTERVIEWS; 
Questioning With a Powder-Puff Edge

BYLINE:  By JODI WILGOREN 

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich., Dec. 12 

 BODY:
The conversations have been less probing than most job interviews, more comfortable than many a visit to the doctor. Sometimes, law enforcement officials sit in armchairs next to the young foreigners rather than across the table, to make it less confrontational. They make small talk, little digs about the quality of passport photos. Often, they apologize for questions that seem redundant or ridiculous.
 After a while, according to people who have sat in and to tape recordings, the meetings sound like a broken record. Investigators read a monotonous list of questions -- Do you know anyone who has recruited terrorists? Raised money for them? Trained in a camp? -- and their subjects, some clearly nervous, others feigning nonchalance, reply in monosyllables: No, no, no. 
 "You know, when you ask 5,000 people the same questions, at some point somebody's going to say yes to some of these, O.K.?" an F.B.I. agent said in a recent interview, according to an audiotape provided by a lawyer who attended. "So if you're thinking these are odd questions, perhaps to some people they're not."
A month after the Justice Department announced its plan to question 5,000 men ages 18 to 33 who arrived in this country over the last two years from nations suspected of links to terrorism, the canvass is just beginning in much of the nation.
In San Francisco, the United States attorney announced today that local and federal officers would fan out across Northern California this week to find 85 people on the Justice Department's list. In Chicago, the authorities just met on Tuesday with Arab and Muslim leaders to discuss how they will proceed. 
Local and federal officers have already started knocking on doors in Florida, Texas and Los Angeles, among other places. There are six people on the list from Utah, three at the University of Iowa. No one, according to immigration lawyers and the Justice Department, has been detained or deported as a result of the interviews.
Here in the heart of the nation's largest concentration of Arab-Americans, where those interviewed have been allowed to bring lawyers or other guests and to tape-record the conversations, many who have participated say that the meetings have been friendly and professional, but that it seems impossible for the pro-forma questioning to yield useful information.
They wonder whether there are hidden motives behind the effort -- to convince the public that the government is working hard to fight terrorism; to isolate foreigners who do not agree to the voluntary interviews for more scrutiny, or to compile a dossier of a segment of the population now deemed suspicious.
"I took a class in survey design -- that's the worst survey I've ever seen in my life," said Sam Khatib, a lawyer who has been at four meetings. "The impression is this is not about collecting information. This is like a psychological assessment of people. I do not think it's about gathering information; it's too silly. I don't think anyone would tell them, 'Yeah, I know terrorists, I know someone who wants to blow up a building.' "
Susan Dryden, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, refused to say how many interviews had been conducted, what had been gleaned from them or the prospects for completing them by the Dec. 21 deadline.
"We are gathering information from individuals that will, hopefully, give us a better and more complete picture of this puzzle," Ms. Dryden said. "Each piece we gather may not be fully understood until it's part of this whole complete picture."
Interviews with half a dozen people who have taken part in a total of about 50 sessions, and tapes of two meetings -- which were provided by Nabih Ayad, an immigration lawyer -- paint a portrait more like a consumer's poll than a criminal interrogation. Have you been to Afghanistan? Participated in any armed conflict? Did you recognize the hijackers' names and faces?
"Please, call me Bob," an F.B.I. agent insists on the tape, trying to ease the called-to-the-principal's-office air. "We do not think you are a terrorist. I just want you to relax. You're not a suspect."
In eastern Michigan, where more than 500 of the 5,000 men live, the interviewers come from 50 local police departments and nine federal agencies. They attended one two-hour training session, and received a 10-page script from Washington. 
Many are unschooled in the politics of the Middle East, confusing Hamas with Hezbollah, and unsure of how to spell the names of places like Dhahran and Abu Dhabi. 
At the University of Michigan, an F.B.I. agent often cracks jokes about the A-minuses on a student's transcript, or how much his hairline has receded since his passport photo was taken.
"A lot of questions, he flew by them because he knew there was no substantial thing he was going to get," said Junaid Iqbal, 22, a Pakistani-born senior who is majoring in economics at Michigan. "I did feel relieved to have it done with. Even if you know you've done nothing, if you get a letter in the mail saying that the feds want to meet you, it's not the nicest of things."
Mr. Ayad, who has sat through seven or eight interviews, said the process seemed like "a way of saying we're doing something." Mo Abdrabboh, another lawyer who has taken part in about eight sessions, noted that "there's no follow-up questions," and said the interviews are "a big waste of time."
But Robert Cares, an assistant United States attorney who is overseeing the project in eastern Michigan, said the questions could result in leads, sometimes even at a future date. "It's unfair to characterize these as stupid interviews," Mr. Cares said. "The acquisition of information is important. You don't get it unless you ask."

HEADLINE: Jai Alai Retires From Connecticut; 
Sport's Fans, Most Elderly, Lament

BYLINE:  By PAUL ZIELBAUER

DATELINE: MILFORD, Conn., Dec. 12 

 BODY:
When the big red Budweiser clock above the bettors' lounge struck 5 today, it not only ended the state's 25-year experiment with jai alai -- the speedy, balletic court game that means "merry festival" in the Basque language -- it also closed a small but colorful chapter in this state's political, cultural and sporting past. 
 Gone now are the players, most of them Basques with names like Arzubia, Txelis, Guisasola and Iturraspe; closed is the aging 4,800-seat multitiered stadium (called a fronton) off Exit 40 on Interstate 95; heartbroken are many of the game's fans, mostly over 50, mostly attracted by the chance to make a few bucks off a $3 bet. 
 "Jai alai is the best thing that ever happened to me," said Linda Ugarte, a betting-card puncher who was holding back tears while holding up a cardboard sign to the audience that read, "We Love You + We Will Miss You." Ms. Ugarte, 49, like many of the customers she refers to as family, feels indebted to jai alai.
"It got me a good husband" -- a Basque player named Okoki who caught her eye here in 1984 -- "and a lot of wonderful friends. I can't put into words how much I love this game," she said, her voice cracking as Ruben Gonzales, a hefty frontcourt player, scored on his opponent a few feet away. "And don't ever let anyone tell you the games are fixed." 
In a way, Connecticut's odd rendezvous with jai alai, which began before casinos existed even in Atlantic City, was fixed from the beginning. The only reason the sport -- a combination of cricket, squash and lacrosse played by men with curved wood-weave baskets tied to their hands -- ever came to Connecticut was to make money -- for Connecticut. 
In 1972, the year after the state Legislature created the lottery, horse-racing and off-track betting to increase its revenue, it added jai alai and dog racing. Horse racing, for various bureaucratic reasons, remained a stalled idea, but by June 1976, jai alai frontons in Hartford and Bridgeport were among the first, and premier, legal gambling sites run by the newly formed Division of Special Revenue. 
The Milford fronton opened in May 1977; by 1978, with no competition from Indian casinos and with the Atlantic City casinos still on the drawing board, it had accumulated a million customers, who placed more than $70 million in wagers. Connecticut collected $76.5 million in revenue from the fronton in its 24 years.
"There wasn't cable television, VCR's weren't that popular yet; we were the only game in town," said Bob Heussler, the fronton's longtime spokesman. 
Bridgeport's fronton closed in April 1995, and a dog track, still in operation, was built adjacent to it. Hartford's fronton closed five months later and just stayed closed. Since then, Connecticut's flirtation with jai alai has focused on the Milford arena, set behind a truck stop and sleepy motel off the Connecticut Turnpike. 
What the place lacks in beauty -- the atmosphere is gray concrete, buzzing halogen lights and an electric scoreboard missing a few bulbs -- it makes up for in heart. 
Down on the front row, directly in front of the metal fence that separates the gamblers from the athletes and the whizzing ball, is Frank Benida, who looks like a groggier, fleshier version of Robert DeNiro in "Casino," gold-chain crucifix and all.
"This is a tremendous, beautiful game," Mr. Benida, 64, said as a jai alai player crashed into the fence before him, spawning cheers from the crowd. For 22 years, on every Saturday "except maybe 10," Mr. Benida, a former Telex operator from Valhalla, N.Y., has been a front-row Milford jai alai gambler, losing a bit more money than he has won. 
"The players know me, I know them," he said. "Every Saturday, you come here and see the same faces. They're all my friends." Three years ago, he said, Ricky Lasa, the president of the jai alai players union, came over and cooked Mr. Benida a Basque specialty, paella. And see that referee, Martija, the former player? "He did the central air in my house," said Mr. Benida with a grin. 
Then there is 84-year-old Tony Consiglio, who wears a blue blazer and a Division of Special Revenue tie clip and works for the agency as a kind of fronton cop, making sure everything is legal and fair.
Mr. Consiglio was Frank Sinatra's personal valet in the 1950's and 1960's, and he said he still remains close to "Nancy and Junior."
In fact, he said, he spoke to Mrs. Sinatra in Las Vegas this morning, offering condolences on this, the singer's birthday. "He's 86 years old today," Mr. Consiglio, said with a tough-guy Hoboken inflection. He and Sinatra never graduated from high school together, he likes to say. "He was a good man," he said, waltzing off to watch the next match.
Not all fans are friendly. "Every day, it's 'Get a job,' 'You stink,' 'You're a bum,' " said Wayne Pattie, 27, one of the few Americans playing at Milford's fronton. 
Thirty-four of Milford's 48 players have found work elsewhere, said Leonard (Lenny) Meyers, 67, a parking garage entrepreneur originally from Rhode Island who is president of Connecticut Jai Alai Inc., which runs the Milford fronton. Mr. Pattie, a well-muscled rising star here, is taking an offer to play in Miami; some of his older colleagues, however, are retiring, or filing for unemployment, or both. 
Known as the world's fastest ball game, jai alai evolved from the sport of handball in the mountainous Basque region of northern Spain. Using a curved basket, or cesta, to hurl a ball at speeds approaching 150 m.p.h. against a wall, Pelota Vasca, or Basque Ball, was often played at local festivals, and eventually came to be known as jai alai. 
Basques carried their sport to Cuba in 1898. After its United States debut at the 1904 World's Fair in St. Louis, jai alai was introduced as a professional game in Hialeah, Fla., in 1924. Helmets were not worn until 1968, after a champion, Orbea, was hit in the head, ending his career.
"These guys spend more energy in one 15-minute game than a baseball player does in nine innings," said Jules Boullosa, 81, of Milford, a 13-year jai alai gambler who said he usually breaks even on his $50 worth of bets here.
Mr. Meyers, who said he had no choice but to close a business losing cash, is not divulging what he plans to do with the fronton's 25-acre site. Many of the 200 or so employees working their last shifts today, though, feel cheated.
Beverly Weir, 63, the fronton's $8.35-an-hour snack-bar attendant for 13 years, may never serve another hot dog or dispense another Pepsi. "Where am I gonna find a job like this?" she asked, wrapping a pretzel in wax paper. "I love this job. A lot of my customers, I don't even have to ask what they want to eat, I automatically get it for them. This is like a second home to me."
And then the big Budweiser clock struck 5, and the fronton's lights dimmed, and after 25 years, jai alai in Connecticut was dead.

HEADLINE: ENRON'S COLLAPSE: MARKET PLACE; 
Calpine's Accounting Ways Have Been Issue With S.E.C.

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
Securities regulators earlier this year instructed the Calpine Corporation, the nation's largest independent power producer, to alter its financial documents to make them more easily understood by investors. And though the company promised to make the requested changes, subsequent filings show that it did not always do so. 
 At issue was Calpine's presentation of its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, commonly known as ebitda, in its annual report. The Securities and Exchange Commission objected to Calpine's version of that figure, because it contained adjustments to earnings that were not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. 
 The exchange of letters between the S.E.C. and Calpine, now under pressure from investors alarmed by its declining profits and growing reliance on energy trading revenues, accelerated in April. 
In an April 19 letter to Charles B. Clark, Calpine's chief accounting officer, H. Christopher Owings, assistant director of corporation finance at the S.E.C., complained that the company's version of ebitda included items added to or taken away from earnings that are not normally part of ebitda. "In future filings, either remove all of the other reconciling items or retitle the non-GAAP measures to accurately describe what it actually represents," Mr. Owings wrote. "At a minimum, retitle the non-GAAP measure as 'ebitda, as adjusted.' "
Calpine responded to the S.E.C. in a letter dated May 7, "We will henceforth label this measure 'ebitda, as adjusted.' " 
But an examination of subsequent filings shows that the company did not always keep its promise. In some documents, the company flagged to investors that its ebitda was its own version, as the S.E.C. had instructed. But in others it did not. 
An Oct. 22 document contains a table showing how the company's ebitda has grown over time. The 2000 figure of just over $1 billion is labeled simply ebitda. Only by reading a paragraph above the table would an investor know that the figure is a non-GAAP measure that includes certain expenses that have been added back, making the figure larger than it would have otherwise been. 
Chuck Clark, Calpine's chief accounting officer, said that flagging the figure as a non-GAAP measure in the text above the table should satisfy the S.E.C.'s request. "We believe the assertion of that word provides the equivalent as saying 'ebitda, as adjusted,' " he said.
But not everyone agrees. John Gavin is president of SECInsight, a Plymouth, Minn., research firm that used the Freedom of Information Act to secure the correspondence between Calpine and regulators. He said: "This is what we call manufactured ebitda. The government told them to stop doing it. They haven't, and it's potentially misleading." 
To be sure, some investors may not care what is included in a company's ebitda. But after the collapse of Enron, which was known for opaque financial statements, investors now find small details like how ebitda is calculated looming larger. 
In an interview last week, Calpine officials said the company was working with its auditor, Arthur Andersen, which also was Enron's auditor, to make its financial reports easier for investors to understand. But the officials declined to specify areas that they might change. In an interview on CNBC yesterday afternoon, Peter Cartright, Calpine's chief executive, said his company was an open book. "We have no secrets," he said.
As is its custom when asked about specific companies, the S.E.C. did not comment.
Baruch Lev, professor of accounting at the Stern School of Business of New York University, said that if a company wanted to present an unusual version of a financial measure, it must also reconcile the number to generally accepted accounting principles. "The numbers have to be anchored to something that we know how it is measured," Mr. Lev said.
He added that a company interested in presenting a clear picture to investors must provide a list of the items and the amounts attributed to each item used to calculate the figure. "Maybe I will accept some of their adjustments," he said. "But just a number that is not reconciliated with GAAP earnings is not very meaningful."
Speaking at a forum in San Francisco, Lynn E. Turner, former chief accountant of the S.E.C. and current director of the Center for Quality Financial Reporting at Colorado State University, discussed how important it was for investors to be able to understand a company's operations through its financial statements:
"Re-establishing the public's trust and confidence in the numbers must also include a renewed effort on the part of the standards setters to provide timely guidance in the form of high-quality accounting standards. And by high-quality accounting standards, I mean standards that will result in the financial statements reflecting the actual economics of the underlying business transactions."
Calpine's stock and bonds rebounded yesterday after the company repurchased in the open market $122 million of its zero-coupon bonds and after Standard & Poor's affirmed its rating on the company's debt. Although the rating is not investment grade, S.& P.'s comments that the company's fundamentals had not deteriorated were viewed as positive by investors. After hitting a low of $10 each during the day, Calpine shares wound up at $15.91 by the time trading closed.
Rick Barazza, head of investor relations at Calpine, said: "We are steadfast that we have sufficient cash to meet both our current refinancing needs. But it's still very much of a concern to investors."

HEADLINE: Added Rush On Revising Tort System 

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 12 

 BODY:
The movement by big business to revise the civil liability system, considered a political dead letter before Sept. 11, may be enjoying its best legislative year ever.
 As with criminal laws and procedures, some say the nation's civil law, or tort, system is now undergoing a necessary re-examination because of the terrorist attacks. Others say that what is happening is little more than opportunism on the part of the business lobby. 
 Already, airlines, landlords and real estate owners in Manhattan, as well as New York City itself, have won important protections against lawsuits arising out of the attacks. And if other businesses and biotechnology companies have their way, they could receive immunities and limitations on damages from lawsuits in the future. 
The issue has prompted a showdown between the administration and Senator Tom Daschle, the majority leader from South Dakota. The White House has always supported changes in the tort system but never pushed for them before the September attacks. Since then, administration officials say such revisions are an essential element of any measure that aids the insurance industry. Mr. Daschle has been working to strip the measure, currently before the Senate, of the liability revisions. 
The insurance bill, which passed the House two weeks ago, would cap lawyers' fees in lawsuits involving future terrorist attacks, eliminate punitive damages and sharply curtail the ability of victims and their families to collect against multiple defendants for noneconomic damages, like pain and suffering and loss of companionship. It would also prohibit plaintiffs from bringing lawsuits in state courts, which defendants often believe are more sympathetic to victims.
Not wanting to be left out, the biotechnology industry, which produces vaccines or medications that might be used to combat bioterrorism, has also sought its own protection from lawsuits. The industry has been pushing for legislation that would protect it from lawsuits over injuries caused by its products.
Some opponents of amending the tort system said they viewed the changes so far as idiosyncratic and largely limited to terrorist attacks of the past and future.
"All of these sporadic liability efforts are really only secondary to the larger pattern of the government bailout of a host of private industries, or idiosyncratic or personal in nature," said Jonathan Yarowsky, a former top Congressional and White House official in the Clinton administration who is now in private practice and representing the Association of Trial Lawyers of America. "Most important, they are tied to the events or the aftermath of Sept. 11 -- and not to any sea change in feeling about the importance of access to the civil justice system."
But some lawmakers say that business interests have been seeking to establish a precedent for more changes when Congress returns next year.
"They are just trying to take advantage of the situation and get their foot in the door," said Senator Ernest F. Hollings, the South Carolina Democrat who has fought against many of the changes being proposed. "It's now on the agenda for next year."
The administration and its supporters have maintained that changes to the rules are essential to revive the economy and also to protect the compensation fund set up by the government for victims of the September attacks.
When the federal Treasury is at risk, "it's easier to make the case to lawmakers that there ought to be some rational limits on liability and the ability of plaintiffs' lawyers to engage in forum shopping," said Victor E. Schwartz, the general counsel of the American Tort Reform Association, a group of businesses and other organizations that have sought changes to the liability laws and often find themselves the targets of litigation. "As a lawmaker, it's easier to understand that there is a limited amount of assets when taxpayers are at risk rather than when General Motors is at risk."
Moreover, Mr. Schwartz and others say there is a far different mood in Washington now on tort revisions.
"We're getting opportunities to talk to more members of Congress about this than anything I've seen in 24 years," he said. "When I went up to talk about torts in the past, I'd often be sent to the most junior aide. Now, members are saying, 'What is this all about?' "
But critics say that the lobbying and proposals reflect naked opportunism of the worst sort.
"Many businesses are taking advantage of the horrible acts of terrorism to immunize their business practices," said Gene Kimmelman, senior director of Consumers Union. "The business community is taking advantage of the fact that terrorists have done horrible things. The country needs to unite to make sure we do everything to compensate people harmed and businesses are up and running.
"But that sidesteps the issue of whether security firms were doing their job. It circumvents such issues as whether people at the World Trade Center did the right thing by telling people to stay at their desks, and whether material was used that might not have been flameproof."
Before the attacks, pledges by the candidate George W. Bush to limit corporate liability and restrain what critics called runaway juries were considered sops to the business community that would have a difficult time being adopted in the face of powerful opposition from trial lawyers and consumer groups.
The issue was put on the back burner by the administration, and the only change that the supporters of revisions managed to move through Congress was a measure protecting teachers and school administrators from lawsuits by students; it was adopted only because of bipartisan support for educators.
With the economy sagging and the federal government taking steps to assist the airline industry and possibly the insurance industry and also set up a large compensation fund for victims of the September attacks, opponents of changes in the tort system have found it more difficult to counter the administration's push to revise the civil liability rules. 
But the administration and the business groups have now moved beyond the September attacks, and to the consternation of consumer organizations and trial lawyers, have found a growing number of lawmakers sympathetic to calls by a variety of industries to protect them from lawsuits. As a result, what began in the days immediately after the attacks as a narrow effort as part of the airline bailout legislation to assist two airlines by limiting their liability to their insurance coverage has gradually cascaded into other areas. 
Calling its legislation the "airline parity act," the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and Larry A. Silverstein, who holds the lease on the World Trade Center, as well as New York City succeeded through heavy lobbying last month to get sharp restrictions on the possible damages they could face from victims' lawsuits. Their protections -- which by some estimates could shield them from $15 billion in potential damages -- were attached to the aviation security legislation that was recently signed into law.

HEADLINE: ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE OVERVIEW; 
Enron Auditor Raises Specter of Crime

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN with JONATHAN D. GLATER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 12 

 BODY:
Enron's accounting firm told Congress today that the company had engaged in "possibly illegal acts" before its collapse and misled its auditors by withholding crucial information.
 Enron executives, meanwhile, presented a plan for the company to survive by spinning off its prized energy-trading operation and emerging as a more conventional energy producer and wholesaler. 
 Joseph P. Berardino, chief executive of Arthur Andersen, Enron's longtime auditor, provided a House panel with the first direct testimony that the company, now bankrupt, might have violated securities laws. He did not specify any violations. 
Both the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department are investigating Enron's demise, which burned investors who once owned Enron stock worth tens of billions of dollars and left thousands of employees unemployed. The S.E.C. went to court today to force Andrew S. Fastow, Enron's former chief financial officer, to testify in its inquiry. It said he had failed to comply with an earlier subpoena. Page C6. 
Andersen auditors told Enron's board that company officials had withheld information about a so-called special-purpose entity on Nov. 2, Mr. Berardino said. One week later, Enron issued a revised financial statement and reported $586 million in losses connected with such entities, contributing to its death spiral.
Andersen also acknowledged that its auditors had made mistakes in analyzing another of Enron's special-purpose entities, which the company often used to remove debt from its balance sheet. "We made a professional judgment about the appropriate accounting treatment that turned out to be wrong," Mr. Berardino said.
Enron said in a prepared statement today that it had always cooperated with its auditors and that it had been the Enron management, not Andersen's, that "discovered the arrangement" that raised questions about the accounting treatment of one special-purpose entity. The company said it had immediately reported the findings to Andersen as well as to an investigative panel of its board.
"Enron is determined to get to the bottom of these issues and began work on that effort before Andersen's advice," the company said.
Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, conceded that someone at Enron must have known about the Enron information that Andersen said had been withheld and that had forced the change in accounting. But he added: "It was not known to our chief accounting officer. It was not known to our senior management."
The quality of the audits is likely to come under close scrutiny because Andersen gave its seal of approval to Enron's financial reports for 10 years, as Enron grew from a medium-size natural gas company to a complex energy trading concern that reported more revenue than all but seven companies in America.
At the hearing, before the House Committee on Financial Services, the first of several House and Senate panels that are expected to inquire into Enron's collapse and its impact on energy and financial regulation, lawmakers said there had been widespread abuses by company executives. Company officials enriched themselves by selling hundreds of millions of dollars worth of stock while they engaged in questionable financial practices that ran the company into the ground, several congressmen said.
Company officials were "just having too much fun," said Representative Richard H. Baker, the Louisiana Republican who presided over the hearings. "We must make the careful determination of whether we are dealing with a case of outright fraud and violation of existing securities laws," he said.
Mr. Berardino of Andersen said he thought that his appearance at the hearing was important to help restore public confidence in the stock market, where investors must trust the quality of financial results certified by the Big Five accounting firms, including Andersen.
"I am here today because faith in our firm and in the integrity of the capital market system has been shaken," he said.
Mr. Berardino said the firm was still seeking to learn why it had not been provided information that would have allowed it to account properly for a special-purpose entity called Chewco Investments. Andersen let Enron exclude Chewco's debt from its own books.
He said Enron had kept Chewco off its books by arranging in 1997 for a financial institution he did not identify to invest $11.4 million in it. That satisfied an accounting rule saying that if an unrelated party provided at least 3 percent of the equity, disclosure was not mandatory.
But, he said, Enron had in fact "arranged a separate agreement with that institution" in which Enron guaranteed half that amount and put up cash to back that guarantee. Had Andersen known that, he said, the accounting would have been different, and Enron's reported profits in subsequent years far lower.
Mr. Berardino said it had allowed Enron to treat Chewco as an independent entity because it had not known the full scale of the company's financial involvement. "Important information was not revealed to our team," Mr. Berardino said.
But he said it had been Andersen's own "error in judgment" that had led to incorrect accounting for another special-purpose entity, LJM Cayman.
In New York today, Enron gathered creditors to present its plans to remain in business. Executives said the company planned to sell its troubled Azurix Corporation water unit and its wind energy business, among other operations that they predicted could raise up to $6 billion. The surviving company would have three primary business lines: pipelines, energy exploration and production.
Enron is in advanced talks to sell a controlling stake in its energy trading unit to one of its financial backers. Wall Street firms like J. P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup, among Enron's largest creditors, are thought to be among those that might want to invest in the trading operation.
"We will do everything we can to maximize value," said Kenneth L. Lay, the company's chief executive, as he spoke to more than 100 assembled creditors, bankruptcy lawyers and investment bankers at the New York Hilton. He said he envisioned the company's emerging from bankruptcy proceedings within a year. 
Mr. Lay declined an invitation to address the Congressional committee yesterday, but he said he expected to testify in Washington at a later date. "I couldn't today because of this," he said, referring to the meeting with creditors. "This is the No. 1 priority for the company."
The trading floor, one of Enron's most prized businesses, is also one of the most fragile because of the risk that employees will leave. It is essential to set up the joint venture quickly, before Enron's traders flee the firm, said Jeff McMahon, Enron's chief financial officer, emphasizing, "The key here is timing."
Enron executives, trying to hurry the reorganization process, offered yesterday's presentation -- one of the first opportunities for creditors to hear directly from the company since its bankruptcy filing on Dec. 2 -- even before an official creditors' committee was appointed.
Enron's bankruptcy lawyer, Martin Bienenstock of Weil Gotshal & Manges, urged creditors to withhold judgment on what had driven the company to bankruptcy so quickly. "Don't assume there's a smoking gun," he said, "because this company was in the forefront of this business."

HEADLINE: Northwest Goes From High-Tech to High Jobless 

BYLINE:  By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: GRESHAM, Ore., Dec. 12 

 BODY:
Steve Haggard was in quality control at the Fujitsu semiconductor plant here. Lisa Pagel was an account manager at a grocery warehouse in nearby Milwaukie. Eric Spengler was a mechanic at a commercial cleaning business.
 These three Oregonians all lost their jobs in recent weeks, in a part of the country where, by many measures, the national recession first hit and continues to hit the hardest. 
 On a percentage basis, Oregon has lost more jobs than any other state in the past year, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, and its unemployment rate, at 6.5 percent, is now the second highest in the nation -- surpassed only by its next-door neighbor, Washington State, at 6.6 percent. 
The number of Oregonians receiving food stamps jumped 32 percent in September, compared with the same month a year ago, the biggest year-to-year increase since 1974. 
When a wave of layoffs hit the the Northwest's high-tech industry, which has replaced the traditional resource industries, like logging and fishing, as an economic linchpin, the ripple effects were severe. Portland's "Silicon Forest" area has nearly one of every 10 semiconductor jobs in the nation. 
Fujitsu announced recently that it would close the semiconductor plant here, which makes "flash memory chips" used in cellphones, hand-held organizers and other devices. That has thrown 670 people out of work and set off a budget crisis for officials in this Portland suburb, where the $2 million a year that Fujitsu paid in taxes represented about 10 percent of all property-tax revenue.
Problems have also hit heavy manufacturing and the service sector, leaving many workers with their first experience of being laid off. 
"It's a weird feeling to have someone just say, 'Poof!, your job's gone," said Mr. Spengler, 38. Like many people filling out unemployment forms at a state office here, he said he had almost taken for granted that he could move from one better-paying job to another.
Ms. Pagel, 36, who started as a deli manager and worked her way up to account manager for a wholesale grocer, said she was stunned when her employer laid her off a week ago.
"I didn't think it would happen to me -- it's the first time ever that I've been laid off, and I've been in the work force for 14 years," she said as she visited the State Employment Department office here with her husband, a tow truck driver, to check listings for other jobs. 
"I don't think it's really hit me yet, that I'm unemployed," she said.
While Fujitsu is pulling an entire plant out of Oregon, other high-tech companies, including Intel, TriQuint Semiconductor and Mitsubishi Silicon America, have all announced cutbacks at plants here.
Heavy manufacturers like Boeing, with plants in both the Seattle and Portland areas, are laying off thousands. Freightliner, a big truck manufacturer in Portland, has laid off about 700 workers this year. Many smaller businesses are contracting as well, officials say. 
Last Friday, state economists said the state was facing a $720 million shortfall in its two-year, $11.4 billion budget. State lawmakers convened hearings this week on cuts and possible tax increases to make up the difference.
Gov. John Kitzhaber, a Democrat, recently formed a 17-member Economic Strategy Advisory Group to come up with ideas for stimulating the state's economy. The state is also starting an advertising campaign to attract more tourists and even to "encourage Oregonians to visit Oregon," as Governor Kitzhaber put it.
While the economy was struggling before Sept. 11, the terrorist attacks have had an impact, as seen in the downturn in tourist visits and the layoffs at Boeing, which has scaled back production of commercial airliners. 
Officials are hopeful that the state will bounce back in the coming months. While unemployment has jumped, they note, the rate is still barely half what it was during the recession of the early 1980's in Oregon, when the state depended more on logging and fishing. 
Even as it became a high-tech state, Oregon never lost its manufacturing base, and in some ways it is paying a price for its reliance on an industry prone to swings in demand. 
In Oregon, manufacturing accounts for about 28 percent of the gross state product, compared with a national average of 17 percent, said John Mitchell, an economist with U.S. Bank in Portland. 
"I don't think this is a structural problem," Mr. Mitchell said. "I think it's cyclical. When there was a downturn in the forest-products sector, I would have said, hey, that's not coming back. But a lot of this will." 
Many of the laid-off workers, as well as local and state economic development officials, said they expected the economy to bounce back soon. 
"This could be a fundamental shift, but I don't think it is," said Mr. Haggard, who is now involved in mothballing the Fujitsu plant.
For now, though, most of the news is bad. Fujitsu's announcement, for instance, came just after SEH America, which produces silicon wafers in Vancouver, Wash., just across the Columbia River from Portland, announced that it was moving some of its operations to Malaysia, and cutting about 350 employees, or a quarter of its Vancouver work force.
Many laid-off workers said they had had problems finding new jobs, while others said they had found work in more traditional fields. Mr. Haggard, for instance, is returning to his old line of work, as a loan officer at a mortgage company. 
Here in Gresham, Max Talbot, the director of community and economic development, said officials were hoping that some other company would emerge to buy the Fujitsu factory.
"Hopefully, a year from now things will have turned around and somebody else will be at that site," Mr. Talbot said. "We're hoping that we can look back on this time and say, well, that was bad, but it wasn't as bad as we feared."

HEADLINE: ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE RIPPLES; 
Fallout From Enron Continues to Take Toll on Power Sector

BYLINE:  By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. and ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
The power companies that not long ago were criticized as profiteers responsible for the California energy crisis are now reeling from Enron's collapse. 
 Their stocks and bonds have tumbled in recent weeks as investors have retreated, worried about whether the companies' financial statements can be trusted and whether their profits can grow if natural gas and electricity prices remain low. Regulators and lawmakers, stung by the California energy crisis and Enron's demise, are talking tough. And Wall Street bankers who raised tens of billions of dollars for the companies are now pulling back, threatening to slow construction of power plants that a few months ago were a national priority. 
 All this is happening despite assurances by analysts and regulators immediately after Enron's bankruptcy filing that the company's collapse was unlikely to cause big ripples in the power industry. 
Since the end of October, the shares of the El Paso Corporation have fallen 16 percent; Dynegy, 30 percent, Calpine, 36 percent: and Mirant, 28 percent.
"Investors are just fleeing the sector," said Carol Coale, an analyst with Prudential Securities in Houston. "I'm not sure it's going to make a turn for the better between now and the end of the year. There's no positive support in any of the stocks."
To allay investor concerns, several of the companies took steps to shore up their financial positions, easing some of the market pressure on their stocks yesterday. 
El Paso, which owns the nation's largest gas pipeline network and is the fourth-biggest gas producer, announced a broad restructuring plan. El Paso said it would sell $2.25 billion in assets, cut capital spending, issue new stock and eliminate off-balance-sheet activities that have raised investors' eyebrows.
The move is, in part, a reversal for El Paso, which recently completed an off-balance-sheet financing. Investors who only a few months ago were encouraging energy companies to grow as fast as possible are now focused on the risks that heavy debt can bring. As El Paso explained yesterday, "It has become clear in the last month that the market now expects energy companies to maintain lower leverage and more simplified balance sheets."
The plan buoyed the company's shares, which rose 4.9 percent, to $41.07.
The company hit the hardest has been Calpine, which operates power plants and is based in San Jose, Calif. Yesterday, Calpine officials told investors that the company would buy back some of its debt, and S.& P. said the company's credit rating, though below investment grade, was not in jeopardy of falling and that the company's fundamentals had not deteriorated. Investors have grown concerned about how much of Calpine's profits are coming from trading electricity and whether it can continue to finance its aggressive growth plan.
Ms. Coale of Prudential said she was encouraged by El Paso's move, and hoped that other companies would follow its lead. Within the last few days, she said she has gotten fewer calls from hedge funds -- which are often making short-term trades or are betting stocks will fall -- and more from mutual fund and pension fund managers who are more likely to buy and hold. "That's the encouraging thing," she said.
So far, the stock market's concerns have been confined largely to electricity and natural gas companies. The average large-capitalization stock rose yesterday and is now up about 5 percent since Enron began its slide in mid-October. But as the stocks and bonds of energy companies plunge, analysts are now wondering whether the sell-off will spread to other companies that have heavy debt burdens and opaque financial statements.
"There is clearly a crisis of confidence," said Glen Grabelsky, senior director of credit policy for Fitch, a credit rating agency. "Anyone who's been in the news recently has been pretty much locked out of the capital market."
The situation could broaden the scope of the current credit squeeze, which is making it hard for highly leveraged companies to roll over loans or bonds when they come due.
The last time Wall Street faced the specter of a widespread credit squeeze was the fall of 1998, after the Russian debt crisis and the failure of Long-Term Capital Management, a hedge fund. Stocks dropped 19 percent from July to early October of that year as investors worried that the economy might fall into recession.
But the Federal Reserve and major securities firms came together to dispose of Long-Term Capital's portfolio, and the Fed cut short-term interest rates to make credit more widely available.
This time, the economy is in recession, and the Fed has already cut short-term interest rates 11 times this year. There is little more it can do if the problem spreads. 
Because debt may be harder to roll over, Mr. Grabelsky said he had asked Fitch's analysts to review the bonds of any company that will need to refinance its debt in the next few months, especially if the company already carries a low credit rating.
Credit rating agencies also say they plan to pay more attention to the interaction between stocks and bonds, especially at companies that issue debt that they can be forced to repay if their stock falls below a certain price -- one contributor to Enron's downfall.
Last week, Moody's Investors Service, a major bond rating agency, announced that it would pay closer attention to such triggers, and Mr. Grabelsky said Fitch would take similar steps.
The retrenchment in the merchant energy industry follows an extraordinary period of rapid growth prompted by legislative and regulatory changes in Washington -- promoted by Enron and other companies -- that created a vibrant wholesale market for both electricity and natural gas. These changes prompted old-line pipeline companies and electric utilities to get into the highflying energy-trading business, and led to the creation of new companies that built power plants, financed by billions from investors.
Total debt issued by merchant energy companies soared from $23.6 billion in 1999 to $48.6 billion this year, according to Thomson Financial. 
But after Enron's downfall, investors are skittish. "The highly leveraged, undercapitalized firms are going to have trouble getting capital," said Philip K. Verleger Jr., an energy economist and former Treasury Department official in the Carter administration. "Some of these generating plants that looked like they were going to be real money makers turned out to be losers."
Conversely, the companies that are now replete with assets -- power plants and other tangible items as opposed to just trading and marketing operations -- will be better off, he said. Even if another major energy trader or merchant company collapsed, it would probably not upend the economy, he added. "It would be very surprising if Enron's failure and even the failure of one or two other energy companies has any real long-lasting impact on economic activity," Mr. Verleger said.
Investor squeamishness may make for a bumpy ride for a while. At Dynegy, a major marketer of natural gas, some investors are nervous about its cash position, as cash and available short-term credit fell from $2.04 billion on Sept. 30 to $900 million on Dec. 6, according to public filings and statements from Dynegy.
Meg Nellen, Dynegy's senior vice president for investor relations, said $600 million was used to purchase natural gas storage sites in Britain in November. Dynegy also used $300 million in short-term debt to finance partnerships that are building electric plants around the United States, she said. The company used the other $240 million to pay for other capital expenses and business needs, like buying natural gas that will be sold this winter.
"There is not a liquidity crisis at Dynegy," Ms. Nellen said.
But short-sellers, who will make money if Dynegy's stock declines, questioned why the company had drawn down its short-term credit lines to finance long-term projects at a time when Wall Street wants energy companies to have a cash cushion. Acquisitions and investments should be financed with long-term bonds, not short-term corporate debt or bank loans, they said.
"If that's the way they're treating the function of corporate finance at this company, heaven help them," said James Chanos, president of Kynikos Associates, a New York hedge fund.
The problems at Enron have already put added pressure on companies to disclose more information to investors, especially about partnerships between companies and outside investors. Yesterday, the Securities and Exchange Commission said it planned to consider new rules next year that would force companies to make more precise disclosures about the assumptions behind their financial statements.
"Each company's management and auditor should bring particular focus to the evaluation of the critical accounting policies used in the financial statements," the commission said. The statement comes on the heels of a promise last week from the five major accounting firms to work to improve financial disclosure.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: ESTATE PLANNING; 
Jolted by Sept. 11, Many Rush to Make Wills

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
Ellen and Mark Genender showed up at their lawyer's office in Manhattan at 9:15 a.m. Friday to complete a task they had begun more than a year ago, but could never quite bring themselves to finish. They signed their wills and put their affairs in order.
 For Mr. and Mrs. Genender, a couple in their 30's who live with their three children on the Upper East Side, that hour at their lawyer's office was the uneasy, and possibly inevitable moment familiar to trust and estate lawyers everywhere: an implicit, if grudging, acknowledgment of mortality. 
 And in the three months since the attack on the World Trade Center, it has taken place across New York, and to a lesser extent the nation, at a brisk and unabating pace. 
If there is any business that is booming since Sept. 11, it is the business of writing wills. Starting about 10 days after the collapse of the towers, and continuing ever since, trust and estate law firms say, they have been overwhelmed with requests from people who suddenly want to prepare their wills. A specialty of law once noted for its procrastinating clients and mordant put-the-client-at-ease jokes has suddenly become serious and urgent.
Many of the requests are from people like Mr. and Mrs. Genender, affluent families with children -- though Mr. Genender, a partner in a private equity firm, has the added prods of working on the 59th floor of a Midtown office tower and flying often on business.
But estate lawyers say the influx is astonishing for its breadth as well as its volume: from people of all ages and economic classes, from married and gay couples and singles, from people with children and without, and from all neighborhoods. (People who work or live near the trade center site, though, have shown a particular eagerness to prepare a will, said Anita S. Rosenbloom, an estate lawyer at the downtown office of Stroock & Stroock & Lavan.)
In the normally sleepy business of writing wills, it is now not uncommon to hear of a three-week wait to get an appointment with a lawyer, or to get the first draft of a will back.
"We've been incredibly busy," said Barry S. Berger, an estate and trust lawyer with Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson. "There has been a tremendous upsurge in people who are first beginning to think about their estate planning, and there has been an inordinate number of our clients who have been sitting with will drafts, who have now seen a new sense of urgency in bringing their wills and planning up to date." Gloria S. Neuwirth, of Davidson, Dawson & Clark, who drew up the will for the Genender family, described a heightened sense of urgency: "It's 'I want to get my affairs in order. I want to make sure my children are protected. Let's get this over.' "
This change in the tempo and tenor of the process -- best known for the awkward dance in which lawyers nudge clients into considering the improbable event of their own demise -- suggests a fundamental change in the way many people have come to think about their lives. Suddenly, the notion of dying at an early age -- before one's parents, and with children still growing up at home -- is not an irrational fear, but the kind of reality that long ago became familiar to people living in places like Jerusalem or Beirut.
For people like Mr. and Mrs. Genender, a project that was started and then forgotten in the day-to-day bustle of raising a family in New York suddenly became critical. Mrs. Genender, who is 34, said: "After everything that happened, and after having three small kids, we decided it was time to do something. Time to sign it."
Mr. Genender, who is 37, said: "We were dragging our feet on getting it finished. The 11th made me realize that you're more vulnerable than you thought. And you can't control the circumstances."
The phenomenon is not confined to the city where the attack took place. Dennis I. Belcher, the chairman-elect of the American Bar Association's section on real property, probate and trust law, who is based in Richmond, Va., said lawyers across the country had reported an upsurge in requests for wills. The wave was accelerated by the rush of anthrax scares and a series of terrorism alerts from the Justice Department.
Still, not surprisingly, the interest in estate planning is most intense in New York, where so many people are reminded of their vulnerability by the changed skyline, the still occasionally pungent smell of smoke in the downtown air, the debris trucks rolling along the Hudson River, the daily obituaries with photographs of young and vibrant people, and, of course, the patch of downtown that remains a barricaded crime scene.
"It puts things in perspective," said David C. Levine, 35, a tax accountant who lives in Chelsea, Manhattan, and who sat down with his lawyer on Monday to tend to his will. Mr. Levine had a particularly persistent reminder: his office was on the 13th floor of 7 World Trade Center, with a view of the north tower. He emerged from the subway station at Cortlandt Street just after the first plane struck that tower.
"I realized it was time to put things in order," he said.
The events of September have, it seems, changed the atmosphere that surrounds the preparation of a will. Lawyers say it is hardly uncommon for a client to expect that a will be done overnight. "I've gotten calls from someone who was delaying, saying, 'Could you come over right now and talk about my will,' " Ms. Rosenbloom said. Lawyers say there has been an epidemic of what are darkly known in the trade as "runway wills" -- overnight wills sought by people who learn of a major plane crash just before they are to fly. 
Even though lawyers usually try to move things along with a bit of Addams family humor, the atmosphere at law firms these days does not lend itself to levity. "It's really hard to keep it light in this environment," said Judith E. Turkel, a Manhattan lawyer. "People come in with emotions running very high, with tremendous fear, and with the realization that they could die in a way they didn't realize before."
There are other factors that lawyers point to in explaining the rush. In a manner reminiscent of how people responded when AIDS was diagnosed in the early years of the epidemic, before there were effective treatments, "sometimes people feel they are gaining some control by putting their affairs in order for their loved ones," Ms. Rosenbloom said.
Joshua S. Rubenstein, who oversees an estate department of 24 lawyers at Rosenman & Colin, said his firm's business had more than doubled over the last three months. "Sept. 11 took away the ability to do what people do when they come in to talk about wills, which is to say, 'Here's what I'd like to do if I die' -- as if they have a choice," Mr. Rubenstein said. "Now it's not if but when."
A number of lawyers suggested that the very nature of the attack meant that the rush in estate planning was not about to fade. Since so many of the victims were so young, it is just a matter of time until their estates wind up in court, the subject of litigation and confusion over the intentions of men and women who never expected to die without a will.

HEADLINE: Need Coasters? Dust Off Those LP's 

BYLINE:  By HILLARY ROSNER 

 BODY:
SHOSHANA BERGER sleeps on a "meat cart" bed. At her office in Berkeley, Calif., she keeps a blanket of stitched-together sweaters wrapped around her legs for warmth. She has jumped on the paint-by-numbers revival.
 Two years ago, Ms. Berger, a writer who did a stint as a trend spotter for Young & Rubicam, was discussing Martha Stewart with a friend. Ms. Stewart had created an impressive empire -- but for 20- and 30-somethings, Ms. Berger said, Martha Stewart Living "is their mother's magazine." 
 "We were talking about what an amazing uberbrand she'd created," said Ms. Berger, 32. "And my friend was like, 'Nobody's doing this for us.' " 
This week, Ms. Berger introduced ReadyMade, her do-it-yourself magazine for the MTV generation, with the tag line: "Instructions for everyday life." It is an irreverent indie-rock Martha Stewart Living that combines cheeky writing with step-by-step instructions on how to make quirky items. Conceived as a Web site ("Right before the content sector of the Net crashed and burned," Ms. Berger said), ReadyMade the magazine will initially come out four times a year and be sold at newsstands, bookstores and branches of Urban Outfitters.
"I've always been a natural-born do-it-yourselfer," said Ms. Berger, who created the meat-cart bed, a plywood platform bed on wheels inspired by industrial food carts, for the magazine's first issue. "I was a total flea market hag. I spent a lot of time dragging furniture off the street and refurbishing it." Among those finds was a hulking metal cabinet from an oil refinery, which she spent three days stripping with vile-smelling paint removers. "My roommates wanted to put me in quarantine," she said. "But it's beautiful." 
Ms. Berger, whose father is a professor of mechanical engineering and a garage tinkerer, believes that common objects should be reused. This sensibility infuses the magazine, from its title -- a nod to Marcel Duchamp's object-as-art ethic -- to projects such as making an LP fruit bowl (which requires nothing more than a record, an oven and some peanut oil). Well-equipped do-it-yourselfers can tackle LP coasters, which require the use of a hole saw and C-clamps. (The coasters are for sale on ReadyMade's Web site in case you are unsure about your skill level: www.readymademag.com.)
ReadyMade's first issue offers instructions for making the sweater blanket, found-object clocks, a Fed Ex wallet and dozens of other items, including a "spice station" by Constantin Boym. But the magazine extends its how-to ethos to droll articles such as "How to Become a Famous Writer" by Neal Pollack, who wrote the tongue-in-cheek book "The Neal Pollack Anthology of American Literature" last year. At one point, Mr. Pollack was accused of being fictional, the alter ego of Dave Eggers, the author of "A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius."
Other ReadyMade headlines in the first issue include "I'm an Unlicensed Therapist, Here's My Card" and "How to Lose 40 Pounds," which begins "First, gain the 40 pounds."
Ms. Berger and Grace Hawthorne, the publisher, printed 50,000 copies of the first issue. They hope to reach 10 issues a year by 2004. The project has been funded by friends and family, Ms. Berger said.
Ms. Berger believes that ReadyMade is tapping into an underserved market: 21- to 34-year-olds who want dominion over their personal environments and who find satisfaction in creating something with their hands. People, that is, who are just too cool for Martha. Some of them reject the Gap-ing and Pottery Barn-ing of America. Others find themselves with B&B Italia tastes and jigsaw-in-the-basement budgets.
Sixty-one percent of American households consider themselves do-it-yourselfers, according to Home & Garden Television. Based on demographic figures, ReadyMade estimates that 33 million of them are between the ages of 21 and 34. In research conducted in June, the Home Improvement Research Institute, which tracks the broad industry, predicted that home improvement product sales would grow by 3.9 percent in 2002.
OTHER attempts have been made to reach this market through decorating shows and books. Katie Brown was heralded as the Gen X Martha Stewart when she had a show on Lifetime (it has since been canceled). A Web site called GetCrafty.com, which features instructions on knitting a human skull, is devoted to "making art out of everyday life." Teen Magazine is even grooming a new do-it-yourself generation with a column (Su Casa) that promises "fun with chairs" and "it's time to customize your walls."
"We're seeing a continuation of the D.I.Y. phenomenon within youth culture, and it seems to be becoming more important now because of the state of the economy," said DeeDee Gordon, a president of Look-Look, a Los Angeles-based company that tracks youth trends. "Anything from baking to making your own CD's to making your own films to knitting."
Olivia Sammons, 26, a photographer's prop stylist in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, makes and sells her own skin-care products. "Martha doesn't represent the kind of woman who is from our generation," she said. "She's got great ideas, but you can say, 'I'd rather make it out of hot pink.' " Ms. Sammons owns two sewing machines; a serger for finishing edges; a well-stocked toolbox, courtesy of her fiance; a glue gun; and her favorite, a grommet kit. She recently took a felting class.
Ms. Berger would probably find her an ideal reader for ReadyMade. "We're more about invention than convention," she said. "People want to customize their environments. You see that in iMacs, the home-studio D.J., all that stuff. Martha totally hit a nerve for the over-40-year-old country-chic-loving market. We want the post-Martha market."
ReadyMade even has a column called Post-Martha, which puts an irreverent spin on a typical Martha project. "It's not about lampooning her," Ms. Berger said. It's about recognizing that Martha's crafty spirit has permeated the culture. 
Yet there are those who think it is a crazy idea to start a magazine when so many established publications are folding. "Advertisers don't really look at quarterlies," said Martin S. Walker, a magazine industry consultant in New York. "And they're operating in an arena that has large-circulation magazines, so if they don't get some size quickly, they're going to struggle." Mr. Walker likes ReadyMade's premise, but doubts it can succeed. "As an editorial idea, it sounds like it has merit, but I'm not sure it's a business idea," he said. "And you have to have both."
Dan Capell, the editor of Capell's Circulation Report, based in New York, also had some doubts. "It's such a crowded field to begin with," he said, "and the ad climate is so bad." Mr. Capell also questions whether, amid generally poor newsstand sales, customers will shell out $4.95 for ReadyMade's mere 76 pages, even if they are 50 percent recycled heavy-stock paper.
Nonetheless, ReadyMade hopes to engage its readers through its own kind of market research, which has been influenced by the give and take of the Internet. Ninety percent of the projects in the magazine's first issue were created and designed by readers who received a trial issue in April. Among the submissions, said Ms. Berger, were things to make with your first issue of ReadyMade.
Ms. Hawthorne, ReadyMade's publisher, previously worked at the failed media Web site Inside.com. Unlike the Oprah and Martha empires, which are celebrity-driven, she said, ReadyMade is intended to be community-driven. A "mini-manifesto" in the issue includes a vow of virtue, and the magazine seeks to debunk the maker-as-auteur. 
But even that conscious rejection of celebrity won't stop Ms. Berger and Ms. Hawthorne from trying to build a Martha-style universe, leading masses of glue-gun-wielding youths to ReadyMade product lines (like the paint-by-numbers kits, for which five artists have been commissioned), anthologies and, of course, television shows. "In terms of brand extensions, ReadyMade is one of the most ideal types of media properties," Ms. Hawthorne said. "It's evergreen content."
In other words, it may be time to buy that grommet kit and begin felting.

HEADLINE: Computer Consultant Giant In Europe to Lose Its Chief 

BYLINE:  By KERRY SHAW 

DATELINE: PARIS, Dec. 12 

 BODY:
Geoff Unwin, the chief executive of Cap Gemini, Europe's largest computer services firm, will retire in 2002, the company said today. Paul Hermelin, the chief operating officer and the architect of the company's acquisition of Ernst & Young's consulting arm last year, will replace Mr. Unwin.
 The company also announced that because of worsening erosion of its revenue after the Sept. 11 terror attacks, it will lay off 2,500 more workers, bringing the jobs cut so far this year to 5,400, or 9 percent of its former work force. 
 Mr. Unwin's announcement was unexpected, but the company said it was not a result of pressure by the board. Rather, the company said in a statement, it came from Mr. Unwin's desire to finish his career when he turns 60 next year. Mr. Unwin, who has been at Cap Gemini for 11 years, will remain on the board.
Mr. Hermelin, 49, joined Cap in 1993. He will retain the chief operating officer title after he takes over the top post in January.
The transition comes at a difficult time for the company. Like other technology consultants, Cap Gemini has experienced a sharp contraction in revenue in the last year, made worse by the newfound emphasis on United States business after the Ernst & Young deal, which brought to one-third the share of its revenue derived there.
Shares of Cap Gemini have fallen 53 percent in 2001, and closed today at 80.5 euros ($71.80) in Paris.
The job cuts announced today are expected to save the company around $715.6 million annually.
In a conference call today, Mr. Unwin said that Cap Gemini expected a decline in revenue in the first half of 2002, but that major outstanding contracts to be completed in the second half "should help lift revenue figures regardless of economic outlook," Bloomberg News reported.

HEADLINE: Political Memo; 
Bloomberg Appointments Trouble Some G.O.P. Leaders

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
Shunning the political party that he adopted to successfully usher him into office, Mayor-elect Michael R. Bloomberg has put together an inner circle that is nearly Republican-free. His selection of four deputy mayors, the corporation counsel and the leader of his transition team, registered Democrats all, has set off some grumbling among the state's and city's Republican leaders, some of whom believe that Mr. Bloomberg owes them at least a nod as he puts together his administration and who worry about what his choices may mean for city policies.
 "It was a pretty difficult campaign, and a lot of people extended themselves," said Guy V. Molinari, the Staten Island borough president, one of Mr. Bloomberg's earliest and most vocal supporters during the mayoral campaign. "One way you extend yourself back is by appointing at least one Republican, that is how the book runs. I hope going forward he becomes more sensitive to that fact." 
 In New York City, where Democrats outnumber Republicans roughly five to one, a qualified token hire might be enough to mollify many of the most conservative elected officials. But Mr. Bloomberg, who paid for his campaign with his own money and often boasted that this helped keep him from owing anything to any special interests, so far seems impervious to this notion.
On Tuesday, during a news conference in which he announced the appointments of Carol A. Robles-Roman as deputy mayor for legal affairs and Michael A. Cardozo as his corporation counsel, both were asked for their party affiliation. Mr. Bloomberg seemed genuinely surprised, looked at the two appointees with widened eyes and said, "I never asked you." Only Edward Skyler, his press secretary, is a registered Republican, and he changed his registration from independent over the summer, Mr. Skyler said.
Further, many of the state's more conservative leaders are concerned about the policy implications of key appointments: Marc V. Shaw, executive director of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority; Dennis Walcott, the longtime leader of the New York Urban League; and Patricia E. Harris, who worked in the Koch administration, all named deputy mayors; and Nat Leventhal, who leads his transition team which is appointing commissioners.
The leaders say they are wondering whether Mr. Bloomberg, a lifelong Democrat who changed parties to run for mayor and who, near the end of his campaign, stood shoulder to shoulder with Gov. George E. Pataki and proclaimed himself a liberal, will remove some key pillars of the Giuliani administration. "I would like him to switch parties so when he starts his liberal policies I will better be able to attack him," said one leading Republican strategist who preferred not to pick a public fight with the mayor-elect.
Mr. Skyler said yesterday that critics should wait and watch. "The mayor-elect has tremendous respect for Guy Molinari, who was one of his closest advisers," he said. "He spoke to the borough president this morning and assured him that the process is still in its early stages." A few Republican leaders said yesterday that Queens party leaders had already been called, and that City Councilman Thomas V. Ognibene, among other Republicans, was being considered for a job. Mr. Ognibene did not return calls seeking comment yesterday. 
Many leaders accept Mr. Skyler's explanation and even say that Mr. Bloomberg's moves could bring newcomers to the party. "I am confident that there will be Republicans in key positions," said the majority leader of the State Senate, Joseph L. Bruno, yesterday. 
Still, several Democrats have looked upon Mr. Bloomberg's appointments with a smile. Mark Green said yesterday that he would have asked many of the same people whom Mr. Bloomberg has called on to serve in his administration had he managed to capture the mayoralty. Others said that unlike with the Giuliani administration, in which Democrats who joined found themselves scorned by their party for their disloyalty, no one cares this time around because Mr. Bloomberg's Republican stripes are nominal at best.
"Do you expect me to complain?" said Fernando Ferrer, who consults with Mr. Bloomberg regularly about various issues. Indeed, Mr. Bloomberg's first courtesy calls were to Democratic leaders including Mr. Ferrer, the labor leaders Dennis Rivera and Randi Weingarten, and the Rev. Al Sharpton. Mr. Bloomberg's other closest aides yet to be given formal titles include Kevin Sheekey, a former aide to Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, and William Cunningham, a former executive director of the state Democratic Party.
Some Republican leaders said yesterday that given the anemic pool of registered Republicans in the city, Mr. Bloomberg best serves his party by simply governing well, regardless of the party affiliations of his appointees. "If Bloomberg ends up being a good mayor, that is what helps," said Kieran V. Mahoney, a Republican strategist. "People will then say, 'You elect Republicans and good things happen.' "
But others are concerned that it is only a matter of time before Mr. Bloomberg starts scuffling with Gov. George E. Pataki, who does not need tension with a leader from his own party during an election year. Because of tremendous losses that the city and state have incurred since the terrorist attack in September, Mr. Pataki will have to make tough budget decisions and cannot afford to alienate upstate voters, whose local economies have been troubled for years. But if Mr. Bloomberg begins to grumble about the city not getting its share, that could create tension between the two men, some party leaders said.
Already this week, Mr. Bloomberg has expressed disappointment over the governor's decision earlier this year to appeal a landmark court ruling that ordered a major increase in spending on New York City schools by the state.
"I am sympathetic with the plaintiff," said Mr. Bloomberg, referring to the Campaign for Fiscal Equity, which brought the suit. Mr. Giuliani had said earlier that he would have preferred that Mr. Pataki not appeal the decision.
Michael McKeon, a spokesman for Mr. Pataki, said yesterday: "We think it's important that he have a good team in place. In making his decisions the governor has focused on ability and merit, not on politics, and it seems Mr. Bloomberg is doing the same."
Many other Republicans said yesterday that it was still too early to draw broad conclusions about Mr. Bloomberg and his new policies, and that anyone who expected him to stack his administration with Republicans was fooling himself, given that the mayor-elect has never tried to cover his true political leanings. 
"We all knew where he came from, he didn't hide it," said State Senator Guy J. Velella, the Bronx Republican leader, who spoke to Mr. Bloomberg yesterday. "So am I overly concerned? No. But are their warning signs that we have to watch him and make sure he keeps the faith? Absolutely."

HEADLINE: City Has Idea (Think Office Buildings) to Stretch Midtown to Far West Side 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
The oversize maps propped up on easels in City Hall yesterday -- to help officials explain their plans to extend the Midtown business district to the far West Side of Manhattan -- discreetly omitted any mention of a new stadium there. 
 So Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, the city's first sports fan and stadium booster, borrowed a black Magic Marker from an aide, strode up to one of the easels and scrawled "N.Y. Jets" and "Olympic Stadium" over a section of the map that had been labeled simply "the rail yards." "It's a nice spot," he said. 
 Stadium or no stadium, city officials said yesterday, the time has come to develop a new business district in a 59-square-block area stretching from West 24th Street to West 42nd Street, and from the Hudson River to as far east as Eighth Avenue. 
The city's Planning Department has issued a 65-page report that calls for extending tracks for the No. 7 train from Times Square south to Pennsylvania Station and west to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, and changing the city's zoning rules to allow for the construction of bigger office buildings in the area. 
The new business-oriented approach is reflected in the name for the neighborhood: Far West Midtown. And although the World Trade Center attacks, the weakening economy and the city's looming budget deficits may make it seem like an odd time to unveil big plans for new development, Joseph B. Rose, the director of the city's Planning Department, insisted that the proposal was eminently doable. "This is not pie in the sky," he said. 
Mr. Rose proposed two ways in which the plan could pay for itself: levying a fee on developers who want to build bigger buildings at the new zoning levels, and dedicating part of the increased property taxes to backing capital-improvement bonds. 
But it could be a lengthy process. The subway extension is subject to an environmental review, the State Legislature would have to approve the plan to dedicate part of the taxes, and the Planning Department has to draft the new zoning regulations.
Mr. Giuliani applauded the plan, saying it would give an economic lift to an area he described as "underproductive." He said that the transportation improvements would pave the way for a new stadium or Olympic center, if approved, but would create a new business district in any case. And, he said, the plan takes on added significance as the city tries to find office space for businesses displaced from Lower Manhattan following the terror attacks.
In releasing the plan at the end of his mayoralty, Mr. Giuliani was, in effect, leaving it to Michael R. Bloomberg to put in place.
The governor-elect of New Jersey, James E. McGreevey, who met with Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Bloomberg yesterday, was less than enthusiastic about the thought of losing the Jets to New York. 
"It is incumbent upon New Jersey," Mr. McGreevey said, "to set forth a fiscally responsible and thoughtful plan toward encouraging a long-term commitment on behalf of the Jets management team."

HEADLINE: Swift Action Is Planned On Fare Plan In New Jersey 

BYLINE:  By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: NEWARK, DEC. 12 

 BODY:
New Jersey Transit officials plan to move swiftly to raise fares next year, scheduling hearings and a vote for early January and the new rates to take effect April 1. 
 The date of the vote, Jan. 7, would allow Acting Gov. Donald T. DiFrancesco to approve the new rates a day before leaving office, sparing his successor, James E. McGreevey, the politically onerous chore of giving the increases his blessing. 
 The proposal calls for fares to increase an average of 10 percent next year. In each of the five following years, automatic fare increases would be pegged to the inflation rate. Fares last rose in 1991. 
Tom Wilson, a spokesman for Mr. DiFrancesco; a spokeswoman for Mr. McGreevey's transition team; and James Weinstein, the chairman of New Jersey Transit, all said today that there had been no discussion between the DiFrancesco administration and Mr. McGreevey's aides about the proposed increase. But at the board meeting, few were accepting the idea that the increases were about to be put into effect without the blessing of both the departing and arriving governors.
"They are sneaking it in the gap," said William Wright, a spokesman for the New Jersey Association of Railroad Passengers. "Plus they are holding the public hearings the day after New Year's Day, when a lot of people will still be out of town. It's all designed to cut down on opposition."
Mr. Wilson, the spokesman for Mr. DiFrancesco, said that although Mr. DiFrancesco had made no final decision, "it was certainly an appropriate time for an increase given the strains on the system."
The plan would mean an average fare increase of 10 percent in the first year for more than 90 percent of New Jersey Transit's 380,000 daily bus and rail commuters, many of whom buy monthly passes. But with the plan's elimination of some discounted round-trip "excursion" fares during off-peak hours, the increases for riders at those times amount to 44 percent to 89 percent on a number of lines.
The discount for people 62 and older would drop to 50 percent from 55 percent.
There would be no change in 2002 for the new Hudson-Bergen Light Rail line, which connects Bayonne and Jersey City and will soon extend to Hoboken. 
After that, the fare would rise with inflation -- a figure that Jeffrey Warsh, the agency's executive director, said was likely to be in the "2 to 3 percent range."
The increase would begin to close a gap in which revenues from fares declined 29 percent while costs have risen 67 percent. The agency is running an annual deficit of about $500 million, which has been covered in recent years by state subsidies and the use of some capital funds for operating expenses.
For commuters into New York, the proposal comes nine months after a large increase to ride the PATH into Lower Manhattan and at a time when concerns have been raised that increases may be needed in 2003 to run city buses and subways. 
The public hearings, on Jan. 2, will be at 8 p.m. at the following locations: the auditorium of the Atlantic County Office Building in Atlantic City, the council room of Freehold Borough Hall in Freehold, the multipurpose room at the Department of Transportation's headquarters in Trenton, the board room at the New Jersey Transit headquarters in Newark, Paramus High School in Paramus, and the lobby of the Walter Rand Transportation Center Terminal in Camden.

Details of Rate Plan
Here are highlights of New Jersey Transit's proposal to raise most train and bus fares by about 10 percent on April 1:
* Eliminate weekday rail round-trip excursion fares. This would increase fares 44 percent to 89 percent.
* Set a common rail fare -- $3.30 one way -- between Newark's two train stations and New York. The current fares are $2.50 between New York and Newark Pennsylvania Station and $3 between New York and Broad Street.
* Reduce the discount to 50 percent from 55 percent for people 62 and older.
* Raise the surcharge for buying tickets aboard trains to $5 from $3.
* Limit refunds to 10-trip and monthly passes. Currently the refund policy extends to one-way tickets.
* Combine one- and two-zone bus fares into one zone.

HEADLINE: The Center Can Hold 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
"Things fall apart," bemoaned the poet Yeats, "the center cannot hold. . . ."
 Not so today. In three critical areas, the center is holding up fine. 
 1. Missile Offense and Defense: The Shanghai "no-deal deal" between President Bush and Vladimir Putin, which seemed to go off the tracks at their summit in Crawford, Tex., is now back on. 
The U.S. will "unilaterally" reduce its offensive nuclear missile stockpile to 2,000 or less, a level that the Russians can afford to maintain. That's a relief to Colin Powell coalitionaries. Meanwhile, as urged by the Rice-Rumsfeld right, the U.S. will exercise its option to withdraw from the cold-war ABM treaty, enabling us to build a limited missile defense against rogue states and terrorist groups. 
In the U.S., this reassures hard-line strategists who are troubled by our huge stockpile reduction and who have insisted Bush live up to his missile-defense campaign pledge. Soft-liners like Senator Joe Biden and consterned scientists will grump, but their ranks are thinned by the growing prospect of a Saddam or independent terrorist buying or building a nuke that could take out a U.S. city. 
Putin will sulk about ABM withdrawal but has to accept the double unilateral. Result: weaker missile offense, stronger missile defense -- a good deal for all medium-liners. 
2. The Anti-Recession Deficit: The president and the Republican House steered right, offering speeded-up tax cuts for all taxpayers and a tax-cut bonanza for big business. The Democratic Senate steered left, preferring direct assistance to the growing number of unemployed. Result: impasse. 
But lo! Bush has just signaled his willingness to aid the jobless with longer benefits and assistance with health insurance, while denying major corporations much of the succor they seek. And the Democrat Tom Daschle, while still dragging a foot on speeding up cuts to individuals, responded with acceptance of tax breaks to business for job-creating investment. Both sides are flirting with the Republican Pete Domenici's idea of a short holiday from the payroll tax. 
In a recession, temporary red ink is desirable. It now looks as if the lefty spenders and the righty tax-cutters will eschew their old lock-boxing and meet in the popular middle. 
3. Prosecution of Suspected Terrorists: Only last week, Attorney General John Ashcroft was smearing all who opposed his proposed secret military trials in the U.S. as unpatriotic aiders of terrorists. He adjudged American judges unable to protect secrets and American juries too craven to convict terrorists. 
Evidently cooler heads are prevailing. The first indictment related to the Sept. 11 attack was filed this week in a civilian criminal court, not a military tribunal. The venue chosen by Michael Chertoff, head of Justice's Criminal Division, was the Eastern District of Virginia, where jurors are not easily intimidated and are not averse to the death penalty. 
Meanwhile, at the Defense Department, Secretary Donald Rumsfeld treated the concerns expressed about civil liberty as "useful." He turned for guidance on military tribunals for Al Qaeda leaders to such tough-minded and respected legal minds as Judge William Webster, former F.B.I. and C.I.A. chief, and Lloyd Cutler, adviser to presidents, it seems, since Lincoln. 
The Pentagon refinement of Bush's military order may well incorporate rights to the accused that are in today's Uniform Code of Military Justice but were expressly denied in his original, hastily drawn order. 
Such a defender of personal freedom as the conservative representative Bob Barr of Georgia does not challenge Bush's authority to convene a military tribunal overseas to do speedy justice to non-U.S. citizens. But if such trials are held inside the U.S., he says, the president is required to ask for a declaration of war (which Barr introduced) or to seek specific authorization by Congress. 
What we are likely to get, if Bush is wise enough to ask for it, is Congressional approval of overseas trials of terrorist leaders by military courts adhering to basic standards of U.S. military justice. Most civil libertarians as well as Ashcroftite zealots would express a degree of satisfaction with this, just as they have with the trial of the accused conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui in a regular criminal court in Alexandria, Va. 
Thus is the center holding. Nothing is falling apart. The falcon hears the falconer loud and clear.

HEADLINE: Making the City Whole 

BYLINE:  By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
Who loves New York?
 During the unimaginable agony that followed the attack on the twin towers it seemed that everybody did. 
 Signs sprouted at sporting events from coast to coast saying, "We're all New Yorkers." Good wishes and emergency assistance flowed into the stricken city from every part of the nation.
Robert Byrd, a West Virginia Democrat and chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, dubbed himself the "third senator from New York." And when Senators Charles Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton met with President Bush in the Oval Office to explain the dire need for federal assistance, the president said to Mr. Schumer, "You need 20 extra billion for New York?" 
"Yes," said Mr. Schumer.
"You've got it," said Mr. Bush.
Hostility toward the Big Apple was put on hold. New York was part of the U.S., after all. And Rudy Giuliani, the fire-breathing autocrat who remade himself into a sensitive, caring leader, was touted as America's mayor. 
Things have changed. Not drastically. But somewhat. Americans, for the most part, are still concerned about the plight of New York. But as for the federal assistance so quickly and generously offered by the president -- assistance that is crucial to getting the city back on its feet -- well, the government now seems to be saying, "Not so fast."
The $20 billion promised to New York by the president is not really the issue. What is critically important, as members of the House and Senate debate various aid proposals this week, is whether the federal government will ensure that an American city severely damaged in an attack by a foreign enemy will be made whole.
New York is likely, eventually, to get $20 billion or something close to it in direct disaster aid from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. But the catastrophe that hit New York on Sept. 11 resulted in an array of problems far more complex and long-lasting than those that tend to result from an earthquake or a hurricane or a tornado.
"In the long run we are going to need more than $20 billion," said Senator Schumer. He noted that an enormous number of businesses, which collectively employ thousands upon thousands of people, are trying to decide right now whether to stay in Lower Manhattan, or even whether to stay in New York.
"No amount of FEMA aid is going to keep either Merrill Lynch or Joe's Hardware Store in Lower Manhattan, because FEMA doesn't pay for that," said Mr. Schumer.
The city is faced with a long list of similarly difficult and potentially debilitating problems. Other forms of assistance are essential, said Mr. Schumer. "The most important thing is to get as many ongoing revenue streams as possible early on."
The Senate has approved an appropriations bill that would bring the total federal aid to New York this year to $12.5 billion (about 60 percent of it FEMA money). The House has passed a bill that is substantially less generous. It would result in a total of $9.5 billion in aid for New York.
House and Senate conferees are trying to work out the differences, and the result of those negotiations will be telling. An agreement that is close to the Senate version would indicate a genuine national commitment to provide meaningful assistance to New York as it makes its comeback.
At the same time, Senators Schumer and Clinton have proposed that a national economic stimulus package (also being debated this week) contain a $5 billion program of tax cuts and other assistance designed to encourage businesses and residents to stay in Lower Manhattan.
Senator Schumer said he was optimistic that, despite some tough obstacles in Congress, New York in the long run would get the aid it needed. "I look at the glass as two-thirds full rather than one-third empty," he said. 
I asked the senator how he thought New Yorkers should view President Bush as the debate over assistance unfolds.
"His opening gambit was extremely generous," Mr. Schumer said. "I think he fully intends to give us the reimbursement money down the road. But I don't think, at least at this point, that he's fully on board that we should get this panoply of other programs that we need. On the FEMA side, he's good. But on the other side, he needs a little persuading."

HEADLINE: Armey Says He'll Retire, And DeLay Looks to Lead 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 12 

 BODY:
House Republicans began maneuvering for top leadership jobs today as Dick Armey, the majority leader, announced that he would retire from Congress after serving one more year.
 Tom DeLay of Texas, the House Republican whip, did everything possible to secure his position as the overwhelming favorite to replace Mr. Armey as the second-ranking Republican in the next Congress, which convenes in January 2003. 
 By some accounts, Mr. DeLay is already the most powerful man in the House. He has a network of about 65 deputies and assistants, close ties to scores of lobbyists and proven ability as a fund-raiser. 
Mr. DeLay, a hard-changing conservative known for his ability to round up votes in the House, is expected to play a central role in the party's effort to widen its House majority in midterm elections next year.
Representative Thomas M. Reynolds, Republican of New York, a deputy whip, said tonight that Mr. DeLay had commitments from 140 of the 221 Republicans in the House. "This freight train is moving down the tracks," Mr. Reynolds said.
Democrats said they were delighted to have Mr. DeLay as the public face of Congressional Republicans. They vowed to run against him as they ran in 1996 against Newt Gingrich, who was then speaker.
Representative Martin Frost of Texas, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, said: "Tom DeLay is the most divisive figure on the Republican side of the aisle. If he moves up in the leadership, it would make clear that the Republican agenda is far right."
Mr. Armey, who has represented suburban Dallas for 17 years, confirmed his plans to retire in a speech today on the House floor. He threw a few backhanded compliments to his Democratic foes, whom he described as "constant, consistent and reliable."
Mr. Armey, who is 61, said he was "pretty exhausted" and wanted to spend more time with his family. His son Scott is expected to run for the seat Mr. Armey now holds.
House Republicans will choose their leaders after Americans go to the polls next November. In their maneuvering today, Republicans assumed they would keep control of the House. Their calculations could be upended if they lost their majority to the Democrats.
Mr. Armey's colleagues began jockeying for position even before he formally announced his plans. "If you want one of these jobs, you have to move quickly," said a senior House Republican. "Votes are being locked up."
The turmoil in Republican ranks will probably show up more in the race for majority whip than in the contest for majority leader.
Mr. Armey's position makes him second in the House leadership hierarchy, behind Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois. As whip, Mr. DeLay is the chamber's third-ranking Republican.
Mr. DeLay wants his chief deputy, Roy Blunt of Missouri, to succeed him as whip. But it is not clear that Mr. DeLay can force his choice on the party.
In the speaker's lobby, Republicans weighed their options and discussed their own ambitions.
Representative Ray LaHood, Republican of Illinois, said he was considering running for either majority leader or whip. "We need new faces, new blood and new ideas," Mr. LaHood said. 
Jennifer Dunn, Republican of Washington, said she believed that House Republicans should have a woman in one of the top jobs. She praised the Democrats for selecting a woman, Nancy Pelosi of California, to be their whip.
"I'd like to see us match what the Democratic Party has done with Nancy," said Ms. Dunn, who ran unsuccessfully for the job of majority leader in 1998.
Representative John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, has told colleagues he is considering a run for majority leader or whip. "I have not ruled it in or out," Mr. Boehner said.
A spokesman for J. C. Watts Jr. of Oklahoma, chairman of the House Republican Conference, said he too was "seriously considering" a run for majority leader or whip.
The one group on the sidelines, reserving judgment, was moderate Republicans. 
Representative Amo Houghton, Republican of New York, said he was not going to endorse anyone at the moment. "We should keep our powder dry, rather than just going in automatic lock step or rushing into a decision pell-mell," Mr. Houghton said.
Another moderate Republican from New York, Sherwood Boehlert, said: "I would love to see a moderate in the leadership, but I'm realistic. We are a minority in the majority, with 25 to 50 votes in the House Republican Conference."
The House has 221 Republicans, 211 Democrats, 2 independents and 1 vacancy. 
The majority leader sets the agenda of the House and decides what bills will be considered on the floor at what time.
If Mr. LaHood runs for a leadership position, he can count on support from some moderates. "Tom DeLay relishes the idea of being called 'the Hammer,' " Mr. LaHood said. "I'd rather be called the velvet glove."
Political advisers to President Bush said they were skittish about an increase in power for Mr. DeLay because he was a polarizing figure and would be an easy target for Democrats. Mr. DeLay is also more conservative than Mr. Bush on some issues, including economic policy. But the Bush advisers said the White House would not get involved in the House leadership races and would not push one candidate over another.

Suing the City For Sept. 11? Oh, Why Not?

BYLINE:  By JOYCE PURNICK 

 BODY:
THE MAYOR-ELECT, Michael R. Bloomberg, wants his administration to be less litigious than the current one. Would that Mr. Bloomberg's idea caught on with the rest of the world, which has this persistent habit of seeing New York as Fat City. Even now.
 Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has hardly avoided court. But the greatest number of lawsuits are filed against the city, not by it. The suits range from personal injury claims (the sidewalk broke my ankle) to allegations of police brutality. In the fiscal year that ended in June 2000, people filed 26,336 claims against the city, most for sidewalk injuries (3,975), followed by charges of police misconduct (1,781). 
 Settlements cost the city $459 million that year, the latest for which statistics are available. In the most costly category -- medical malpractice suits against the Health and Hospitals Corporation -- the city paid out $150.6 million. Recently, the number of suits has declined slightly, but the settlement costs have risen.
You might expect the litigation to slow down as a hurt and financially damaged city looks to rebuild and weather a recession. You would be wrong. 
In fact, the city is being sued for Sept. 11 and its aftermath. State law gives people three months from the date of an alleged injury or damage to file notice of intention to sue. The city has not yet tallied the claims it has received, and more claims are expected, including late ones that the city has indicated it will not thwart. Interviews with lawyers for the city and prospective plaintiffs indicate that the attack will generate substantially more than 1,000 notices of claim.
The most -- 1,050 so far -- come from firefighters, who contend that they did not have the proper equipment to protect against toxic substances at the attack site.
Their lawyers say they would much prefer not to litigate and instead be compensated by the federal fund that promises financial aid to victims of the attack and their families. But eligibility to share in the fund, sometimes called the superfund, has not yet been defined. So the claims filed by firefighters could function not only to preserve their right to sue, but also to lobby for their inclusion in the federal dollars.
"It would be a shame if they sue because I think the city and the mayor have gone properly out of their way to do everything to make sure uniformed families are taken care of," said Michael D. Hess, the city's corporation counsel. 
But Michael A. Barasch, who represents 700 firefighters who may sue, was not sympathetic. "What if they are not included in the superfund?" he asked. "Do we then say, 'Too bad, we feel so sorry for the city, you have cancer, but you shouldn't sue in behalf of your families' ?"
AN unknown number of lawsuits are also expected from residents of New Jersey, which even asked the city to extend the three-month time limit beyond last Monday for filing claims directly related to Sept. 11.
The Giuliani administration decided yesterday not to oppose late claims from New Jersey, which judges can grant case by case. Roger Shatzkin, spokesman for New Jersey's attorney general, John J. Farmer Jr., said he wasn't clear, though, on what grounds residents of his state might sue. 
He wasn't the only one.
"It's really a little bit of chutzpah," said Mr. Hess, the corporation counsel. "New York City is not negligent in any way. We didn't fly the planes, we didn't maintain the buildings; there's no basis whatsoever to sue the City of New York. However, the mayor feels that there may be a lot of people who have been so busy with other things legal, emotional, whatever, that they didn't know about the 90 days. If someone brings a case, we'll let the judge decide it. We are confident that when a judge does examine the merits of any case relating to that day, we didn't do anything wrong."
Mr. Hess exhorted those inclined to sue the city to realize that the taxpayer foots the bill. His boss's litigiousness aside, Mr. Hess has tried to discourage lawsuits, as have his predecessors. They make only a dent, even with the 1979 law that requires prior written notice of defective roads and sidewalks if the city is to be held liable for injuries and property damage.
Civil libertarians and lobbyists for lawyers successfully fight evergreen efforts in Albany to put limits on personal injury lawsuits. So the suits continue because, as at least eight lawyers said superfluously yesterday in interviews for this column, this is a litigious society.

HEADLINE: House and Senate Negotiators Agree to More Base Closings 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 12 

 BODY:
House and Senate negotiators reached agreement today on legislation that would close more military bases, starting in 2005.
 The measure also says the Navy cannot close its training range on the Puerto Rican island of Vieques until it finds a suitable replacement. The legislation cancels a referendum on the issue that was to have taken place in Vieques next month. 
 These issues and many others were addressed today in a bipartisan agreement on the Defense Department authorization bill for the current fiscal year, which began on Oct. 1. The House and the Senate are expected to approve the legislation in the next few days, clearing the measure for President Bush. 
The House also passed today an intelligence measure that would increase spending by 8 percent -- higher than the 7 percent sought by President Bush -- and puts renewed emphasis on the use of agents to gather intelligence. Actual spending levels are classified, but current spending is estimated at $30 billion.
The military bill provides legal authority for spending a total of $343.3 billion, the amount requested by Mr. Bush, plus $21 billion to respond to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
The House and Senate negotiators decided to provide up to $8.3 billion for continued development and testing of ballistic missile defenses. That sum, the full amount requested by President Bush, is $3 billion more than Congress provided in the last fiscal year. The president could use up to $1.3 billion of new money for efforts to combat terrorism.
Under the bill, military personnel would receive pay increases of 5 percent to 10 percent, starting next month. Noncommissioned officers and junior officers would get the largest pay raises.
The House had opposed another round of base closings, while many senators wanted them to begin in 2003. Lawmakers compromised on an elaborate procedure to review the nation's security needs and close bases in 2005. 
Senator Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said, "We are closing bases to make money available for homeland defense." 
Moreover, Mr. Levin said: "With our men and women putting their lives at risk, they need all the resources we can give them. It's inexcusable that we would maintain bases that are not needed when we've got people putting their lives on the line." 
The Bush administration had insisted that the Pentagon should have the right to close unneeded bases and had threatened a veto of any bill that omitted such procedures.
Closing bases is politically unpopular. Such installations provide thousands of jobs and inject millions of dollars into local economies. But Mr. Levin said many states had found productive uses for military bases forced to close in the last decade. 
House members argued that it would send the wrong signal if Congress moved to close bases while the nation was at war and the armed forces were gearing up for new battles against terrorism.
"Everybody's expressed concern that we should not be doing this while we're at war," said Bob Stump, the Arizona Republican who is chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. In the end, Mr. Stump said, most of the House negotiators accepted the compromise.
Four rounds of base closings since 1988 have shut down 451 installations, including 97 major bases, and have saved $15.5 billion, federal investigators estimate.
House and Senate negotiators said they had decided to delay the next round of base closings to 2005 so the economy could recover from the current recession and the Defense Department could assess its needs and the value of specific installations.
Under the agreement, the president would appoint a nine-member commission to realign and close bases. The commission would meet in March 2005. In May of that year, the secretary of defense would propose a list of bases to be closed. The commission could modify the list. The president would have 15 days to accept or reject the entire list. If he accepted it, Congress would then have 45 days to approve or reject the entire package.
If bases are to be closed, the Defense Department would not necessarily have to dispose of them. It could hold onto some of the bases, as a caretaker, if it believed that they might be needed for "national security purposes" in the future.
With the nation on a war footing, Democrats backed away from their demand that the Navy immediately halt bombing exercises on Vieques.
But the deputy secretary of defense, Paul D. Wolfowitz, sent a letter to Congress saying that the Navy was "planning to discontinue training operations on the island of Vieques in May of 2003, contingent upon the identification and establishment of a suitable alternative."

HEADLINE: Officials Recount Road to Deadlock Over Missile Talks 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER and PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 12 

 BODY:
Six months of negotiations between the United States and Russia over the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty failed because the Bush administration was unwilling to discuss each missile test with Moscow in advance, senior administration officials said today, and because Russia refused any change that would allow unrestricted testing.
 The officials said that the critical moments in their talks came when President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia told Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld in Moscow on Nov. 3 that the American plans for extensive testing would gut the landmark accord. 
 Mr. Rumsfeld shot back that if that was Russia's position, then the United States would withdraw from the treaty -- exactly what President Bush is expected to announce Thursday.
Any hope of reaching an accord was finally buried in the opening hours of Mr. Putin's visit to the White House on Nov. 13. Neither president had any new proposals to break their impasse, each recognizing that there was simply no way to accommodate the Pentagon's aggressive testing program in a treaty that was clearly designed to prevent just that. 
As one senior administration put it this afternoon, the American testing plan "would essentially negate the fundamental nature of the treaty."
Still, at a meeting between the two presidents two days later in Crawford, Tex., Mr. Putin signaled that American withdrawal from the treaty would not end his personal relationship with Mr. Bush, nor would it end Russia's desire to reduce nuclear weapons in tandem with Washington and fight terrorism through greater cooperation.
Mr. Bush also pledged to enhance Russia's role in the NATO alliance and help integrate Russia into the world economy, thus deepening the incentive for Mr. Putin to move beyond the dispute. 
Mr. Bush's expected announcement that the United States would withdraw from the treaty will mark the first time in the nuclear era that the United States has renounced a major arms control accord. His critics at home and abroad argue that it could incite a new arms race and undermine other major accords, including the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. 
A senior administration official repeated today the White House's past offers to Moscow to participate in developing missile defenses and cooperate with NATO in developing such defenses for the Western alliance.
"There is a whole list of potential cooperation on defenses that we intend to fully explore," a senior official said. 
Another official said, "I think cooperation now gets much easier."
The description of the negotiations came today from senior Bush administration officials, as they called around Europe and Asia warning allies of the impending announcement.
They described differences with Mr. Putin as amicable, and said they did not expect an explosive reaction from Moscow. At the same time, they insisted that Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, who had made little secret of his desire to reach a new accord with Moscow, agreed with the president's decision.
American officials said today that they anticipate that Mr. Putin will issue a statement of regret on Thursday but pledge to continue working with the United States to reduce strategic offensive weapons and fight terrorism. 
He may also announce, they said, the size of planned Russian reductions in the offensive strategic weapons, a sign that the two countries are still working together closely. 
If Mr. Putin's objections to Mr. Bush's action are muted, it will mark a pronounced shift. Last summer he warned that abandoning the treaty would trigger the collapse of other arms control agreements and the deployment of new Russian multiple-warhead missiles.
Administration officials said they do not expect either to occur. "I think the Russians will react," said a senior State Department official. "It is not going to be the end of the world, and it will not be the end of cooperation on strategic issues across the board."
However, they said, the reaction of China -- whose small nuclear arsenal would be more vulnerable to any antimissile system than Russia's huge missile stockpile -- was harder to predict. 
China was never a signatory to the treaty, and Mr. Bush and President Jiang Zemin of China have not discussed the issue in any detail. China had previously said it would increase the size of its nuclear arsenal, and Mr. Bush's announcement may well speed that process.
The question of the treaty's fate came up first in the presidential campaign, when Mr. Bush said he would deploy a much more ambitious missile defense system than President Bill Clinton had proposed -- and made it clear that he would not be constrained, as Mr. Clinton was, by the treaty.
Once in office, Mr. Bush's suggestion that, if necessary, the United States could withdraw from the treaty rattled many European and Asian allies. 
In June and July, Mr. Bush sought to reassure those allies during two trips to Europe and by meeting Mr. Putin and pledging to work with him in creating a new "strategic framework." He said he would consult broadly before making any decisions on the treaty.
By the time the two men met in Shanghai in October, the terrorist attack on Sept. 11 had drawn them closer than ever. Mr. Putin emerged from their meeting declaring that "we can reach agreements" on missile defense, and administration officials said that, for the first time, Mr. Putin no longer viewed American missile defense testing program as "a threat." Privately, Mr. Putin said he could "stretch" the treaty to accommodate a great deal of testing.
But it was not clear whether that meant he was willing to reach an agreement allowing tests that the treaty clearly prohibited, or if he would insist that Russia be briefed -- and perhaps approve -- each and every test.
That was the case until the administration sent a detailed list of questions to Moscow, and then sent Mr. Rumsfeld to get the answers on Nov. 3. Mr. Rumsfeld had been the administration's most outspoken critic of the treaty. 
It was Mr. Rumsfeld, who on that Saturday afternoon in Moscow described to President Putin a broad program of American missile defense testing in the air, space, at sea, and from a new base under construction in Alaska.
Mr. Putin objected, saying, "You want such flexibility that you are asking to effectively to gut the treaty," according to a senior administration official who participated. 
John R. Bolton, the undersecretary of state for arms control, who accompanied Mr. Rumsfeld, interjected that he agreed with the Russian interpretation. Mr. Bolton said the United States was "asking for the ability to test" in a manner that was completely "unrestrained by the treaty."
At that point, Mr. Putin asserted that as a lawyer, he viewed the American demand as overly broad with "too much latitude." He said such an interpretation was not acceptable to Moscow. 
"Well, then," Mr. Rumsfeld said, "we will be giving you notification of unilateral withdrawal from the treaty."
Still, there was another attempt to brief top Russian military officials, this time in New York a week later during a meeting of the United Nations General Assembly. American officials described in great detail the tests they had in mind. The Russian officials, according to American accounts, were somewhat stunned by the scale of the testing program, noting that they were completely out of the treaty's bounds.
"Basically what the Russians figured out was that this was a serious testing program to develop missile defenses and that wasn't going to work within an ABM treaty designed to prevent it," one senior State Department official said.
But White House officials held out a sliver of hope that, once they sat down together a few days later at the White House, Mr. Bush and Mr. Putin could work out an accord.
Their aides had left an open space in their draft joint statement that they hoped could be filled with a breakthrough reached by the two leaders. A breakthrough still seemed possible based on their public statements.
But it was a mirage. Neither Mr. Putin nor Mr. Bush offered any new ideas that morning, and during lunch, their senior staffs jammed into a cramped room in the basement of the White House to hastily draft a statement that conveyed a sense of progress on strategic talks when, in fact, none had occurred. 
"We had not reached an agreement," said one official in the room. Moments later, the two president stepped into the East Room with nothing to announce about missile defenses, and over the next two days at Mr. Bush's ranch in Crawford, Texas, they barely discussed the subject. 
Secretary Powell, last week in Romania, told his Russian counterpart that the time was "very close" when the president would make a decision to unilaterally withdraw. Still, there was no progress as Secretary Powell flew to Moscow for a final session with Igor S. Ivanov, the Russian foreign minister.
On Friday, Mr. Bush called Mr. Putin and told him the United States would withdraw this week. 
"It is absolutely the case that this would have been a lot harder to do eight months ago than today, because the president took the time to build the relationship with Russia," a senior administration official said. 
That will depend on the Russian reaction, which will have the greatest effect on how the rest of the world judges the wisdom of Mr. Bush's choice.

HEADLINE: American Express Will Cut Up to 6,500 From Payroll 

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
The American Express Company, which has laid off 7,700 employees this year, said yesterday that it planned to eliminate an additional 5,500 to 6,500 jobs. To cover severance and related expenses, the company plans to take a pretax charge of $240 million to $280 million in the fourth quarter. 
 Michael O'Neill, an American Express spokesman, said that more than half of the job cuts would be in the company's travel business, which has slumped deeply since the Sept. 11 attacks. The remainder will be spread through the rest of the organization, he said. 
 "In October, travel sales were down about 46 percent from a year earlier," he said. "In November, sales were down about 38 percent."
At the start of the year, about one-third of the more than 88,000 people who worked for American Express were employed in its travel business. About one-third of the 7,700 positions that had already been eliminated were in the travel business, Mr. O'Neill said. 
With yesterday's cuts, American Express will have cut about 15 percent of its global work force. Pretax savings generated by the cuts are expected to be $230 million to $260 million next year and about $290 million to $315 million starting in 2003.
The American Express work force in the New York metropolitan area, which numbered about 4,000 employees at the start of the year, will be reduced proportionately to the overall cuts, Mr. O'Neill said. 
American Express said it expected some of the savings to bolster earnings in the form of improved operating-expense margins. The rest will be reinvested in high-growth businesses, the company said. 
Wall Street had been expecting additional cost cuts from American Express, and analysts said the company would lose little muscle by laying off people in the travel business. 
"There are still an awful lot of American Express travel offices," said Michael R. Hughes, an analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company. "The fixed costs have to be killing them, especially when they don't have all this travel revenue to hide behind. Younger, more Internet-oriented people have probably never been in an American Express travel agency." 
American Express has said it has shifted part of its travel business to the Internet, but will not specify how much. 
"The margins in the travel business have been under pressure for years," said Robert G. Hottensen, a specialty financial analyst at Goldman, Sachs. "The cuts that were announced today were expected and are in areas that are kind of logical."
Excluding the announced charge, American Express said it expected fourth-quarter earnings of 34 cents to 36 cents a share, less than the 40 cents a share expected by analysts. 
Credit card billings have also slumped since Sept. 11, American Express said, but the pace of the decline has slowed. 
Billed business volumes were down 14 percent in September, about 10 percent in October and about 6 percent last month, the company said. 
"These declines reflect continued weakness within the corporate travel and entertainment category," the company said in a statement, "offset in part by relatively stronger consumer spending. Credit trends are likely to show a modest deterioration, reflecting the increase in unemployment and the overall industry environment." 
Investors did not react harshly to the news. Shares of American Express, which have lost more than 38 percent of their value this year, fell 84 cents, to $33.42. 
With the expense cuts in place, most analysts said American Express was in good shape to deliver improved financial results next year, assuming the economic slump does not continue. 
"Through this restructuring and earlier ones, the company has lowered its cost base so that even if a recovery takes longer than people expect, they can deliver earnings growth in 2002," said Howard K. Mason, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company.

HEADLINE: Prospects for Stimulus Plan Hinge on Bush Demand for Tax Cuts 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 12 

 BODY:
Negotiations about an economic recovery package hinged today on President Bush's insistence that any plan include a cut in personal income tax rates, a provision that Congressional Democratic leaders said would be hard for their members to accept.
 Both parties said all issues were on the table as the administration and Congressional leaders made one last push to reach a deal on an economic stimulus bill before the House and Senate go home for Christmas. 
 Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill spent much of the day calling lawmakers, trying to assemble a package that could get through both the Senate, where Democrats have control, and the House, where Republicans are in the majority. 
Negotiators from the two parties met for two and a half hours tonight. "We're making a lot of progress, a lot," said Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.
Mr. Bush tried to put pressure on the Democratic majority leader in the Senate, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, by negotiating with at least three moderate Democrats and a group of centrist Republicans on a compromise proposal set out by the administration on Tuesday.
Speaking to reporters today at the White House, Mr. Bush said there were "enough votes to get a good package out of the Senate, a package that I think will help our economy." 
The White House pressure appeared to be yielding some results. Though Mr. Daschle said earlier today that agreeing to accelerated reductions in income tax rates would be "almost an impossibility," by tonight Democrats were discussing giving Mr. Bush some of what he wanted in return for more help for unemployed workers. 
Mr. Bush's latest offer seeks an immediate cut in the current 27 percent income tax bracket to 25 percent, identical to a provision in the House-passed stimulus bill but less sweeping than his original call for cuts in the higher brackets as well.
Democrats said they might be willing to accept a cut to 26 percent. They had argued that any acceleration of the rate cuts included in the tax bill Mr. Bush signed earlier this year would be fiscally irresponsible, would do little to help the economy and would eat up money that could be used to help low-income and unemployed workers.
The compromise offered by the White House included several provisions both parties in Congress agreed to. Among them was a one-time $300 payment to each worker who did not earn enough to qualify for the rebates sent out this summer under Mr. Bush's tax cut, and a move to let some businesses offset past tax liabilities with current losses.
The compromise plan also moved toward the Democratic position on providing assistance to unemployed workers. The administration said the plan would create a tax credit that laid-off workers could use to pay half the cost of health insurance, up to $110 a month for individuals and $294 a month for families. The plan would apply to all unemployed workers, even those not previously covered by an employer-provided health plan.
The administration also agreed to Democrats' demands that workers in all states be eligible for a 13-week extension of unemployment benefits beyond the current 26-week limit. And it addressed their insistence that the unemployment-insurance program expand to part-time workers by proposing to release more than $4 billion to states next year to bolster programs for the jobless.

HEADLINE: ARCHITECTURE REVIEW; 
Fireside Intimacy for Folk Art Museum

BYLINE:  By HERBERT MUSCHAMP 

 BODY:
WE can stop waiting for state officials to produce plans for redeveloping the city's Financial District. The Rebuilding of New York has already begun. The new American Folk Art Museum in Midtown, designed by Tod Williams and Billie Tsien, is a bighearted building. And its heart is in the right time as well as the right place. The design delves deeply into the meaning of continuity: the regeneration of streets and cities; the persistence and mingling of multiple memories in the changing polyglot metropolis; and the capacity of art to transcend cultural categories even as it helps define them.
 Folk art denotes point of view: this is the design's understated message. History, aesthetics, anthropology, religion, psychology, politics, authorial intention: the works on view will try on as many interpretive frames as we care to toss around them. Not all will fit. But the building enshrines the desire to comprehend as an American freedom. 
 A wonderful painting hangs in the museum: an 1813 sign from a Connecticut tavern. Displaying a stagecoach and pair, the sign advertises "Entertainment for Teams." I asked Stacy Hollander, the museum's chief curator, what the entertainment might consist of. "Drink," she replied, "and maybe music, sitting by the fire, talking, companionship -- drinking." What a world. Europe gave us the tavern. We gave them EuroDisney. That's entertainment! 
There is a category of building now called "entertainment architecture." Disney virtually invented the genre by reinventing the Victorian resort. Michael Graves, Robert A. M. Stern and John Jerde are among its most successful practitioners. 
Mr. Williams and Ms. Tsien entertain in the archaic fireside tradition. These modern architects have made values associated with folk art -- intimacy, companionship, aspiration -- accessible to modern audiences. They do not crib folk-art forms. They do not draw upon pop-culture kitsch. Rather they turned modern architecture inside out. In place of modernism's aesthetic of objective norms, they use abstract form to explore the emotional content of public space.
The two inject themselves into the work, not to express their egos but to create rooms where our empathic powers -- including the power to be moved by art -- rise naturally into a conscious frame of mind. That's entertainment for grown-ups.
The museum's facade is already a Midtown icon. Like that of the Austrian Cultural Institute, now nearing completion two blocks away, it demonstrates the capacity to project a powerful urban presence at town-house scale. For the best view, approach the museum head on, from the mid-block arcade between the CBS and the Deutsche Bank Buildings on the south side of West 53rd Street.
These two towers make a frame of time as well as space. CBS, designed by Eero Saarinen, is one of the last New York skyscrapers of serious ambition. Deutsche Bank, designed by Kevin Roche (who completed the design of CBS after Saarinen's death), is a sad relic of postmodern confusion. An outdoor sculpture in the public space aggravates the disarray. But that's New York, a city whose landmarks are often accidentally framed.
Viewed from this approach the museum's facade resembles a flip-flop version of the classical aedicule: a shrine within a temple in the form of a temple front. This temple's giant "doors" are two six-story trapezoidal walls. The walls splay outward, as if hinged, from a glazed, off-center seam that extends vertically across the facade. A triangular form, inserted between the trapezoids, flares from the top of the seam to the roof line.
The three forms are made from panels of alloyed bronze. Each panel was produced individually by pouring the molten metal onto two kinds of surface: bare concrete or stainless steel. Gases escaping from the materials formed irregularities in the color and texture of the panels, which are themselves individually sized. The results look like travertine marble alchemically rendered into bronze. (Compared with this radiant effect, the marble miracle mile of the Getty Center in Los Angeles looks produced by reverse alchemy. Travertine in, chip board out.)
The architects have acknowledged that the form created by the triangle atop the window is an etherealized human hand. The image establishes the building in relationship to the craft tradition and also to the continuity of modernism as epitomized by the French architect Le Corbusier. That 20th-century pioneer inscribed hand forms into his poured-concrete buildings to symbolize humanity's mastery of tools. This is the common theme Mr. Williams and Ms. Tsien have uncovered for their building and the art inside it.
The museum's interior is an atrium of domestic proportions, slightly stretched. Even without a fireplace and rum punch, the place is companionable. The intimacy is also an alchemical operation, because visitors will be moving around and atop the building's exposed concrete structure. At first you may not notice this Brutalist proposition. In the galleries the concrete has been polished to reveal the terrazzolike aggregate within it. The 19th-century philosophy of "truth to materials" is applied more consistently here than in buildings by Frank Lloyd Wright.
Most of the art is displayed in a compact stack of four gallery floors that rise from the second story to a skylight on the roof. Elevators serve the galleries, but staircases offer a better way to experience the spatial continuity. A wide main staircase is complemented by narrower flights along the side walls. Designed on the scale of backstairs in a mansion, the latter encourage visitors to find individual paths through the museum.
The arrangement of galleries recalls Mr. Williams and Ms. Tsien's design for an art collector's private house in Manhattan, completed in 1995. Low-ceiling spaces of roughly rectangular shape alternate with longer balcony areas overlooking the central atrium. What is the opposite of museum fatigue? This arrangement embodies it.
A giant weathervane of yellow metal dominates the atrium's thin slot of a void. Designed in the form of a Native American chief, this haunting figure is pierced by bullet holes made by the American pastime target practice, a post-tavern amusement, perhaps. The weathervane dominates the space not only by virtue of scale, but also by suggesting that the museum's view of folk art is not naive. Folks can be quite mad. As both cowboy and Indian, Charlton Heston is folk art, too.
Materiality always pulls Mr. Williams and Ms. Tsien back from the brink of pure abstraction. They treat pieces of translucent corrugated plastic, steel supports on a stair, and panels of polyurethane foam like artifacts of incalculable value, as if the building were the private scrapbook of industrial culture. Now and then you want to swat the architects for coming on so Zen. Yeah, we're a wasteful society, we treat everything like junk, so what?
At this moment in American history, however, we'd do well to take our technology and its products less for granted. Or at least architecture is a field in which it is still possible to embody our technology in humanist form. This is the concept on which the tradition of progressive architecture was established.
In New York we've been wasteful of that tradition for more than a generation. Architects like Mr. Williams and Ms. Tsien, who are among its leading exemplars today, have not previously been favored with commissions commensurate with their talent. Our builders have largely dedicated themselves to turning back the clock. With few exceptions they have treated the city's postwar architecture as if it were that yellow weathervane. Let's kill off the present! Bang, bang!
But a city whose thoughts have turned to rebuilding has an opportunity to restore its eroded sense of optimism about the urban future. Mr. Williams and Ms. Tsien have made a magnificent contribution to this project. I see their building's flaring facade as the wings of my personal holiday angel. It tops my New York tree.

HEADLINE: America's Tires: Worn Down, Overlooked and Underinflated 

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
THIRTEEN months after Congress required new tire safety measures, out of concern over Ford Explorer rollovers caused by the failure of Firestone tires, studies by the Transportation Department show that there is still much to be done to improve the safety of the small but crucial patch where rubber meets the road. And the department has already missed a deadline established under the new law.
 That deadline called for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to issue by the end of November detailed regulations that automakers will have to follow to install the tire-pressure-warning systems that Congress wants on all new cars. In a recent interview, Dr. Jeffrey W. Runge, the agency's administrator, would say only that the rules would be published soon. 
 By June, the agency is supposed to issue rules on tire labeling. Staff members say they are likely to meet that deadline.
Since tires became an issue, Mr. Runge's office has completed surveys on the condition of tires on the road, and the results were distressing. Government experts say they do not know if tire problems are worse now than before, because the surveys are the first of their kind. But they show that motorists widely neglect their tires -- and that service stations often don't help.
"Tires tend to be the forgotten part," Dr. Runge said. A member of his staff, Roger Kurrus, chief of the Consumer Automotive Safety Information Division, said, "People just assume that tires are there and they're safe, with never a second thought."
The studies show how little consideration is given to tires. One indicated that one passenger car in 11 has at least one bald tire. The other shows that more than one car in four has at least one tire underinflated by at least 8 pounds per square inch, or p.s.i.
Tires were most likely to be underinflated on older vehicles, especially pickups, sport utilities and vans. Rear tires tended to be most frequently underinflated. The study is posted at www.nhtsa.dot.gov/people/ncsa.
But even conscientious drivers may find it hard to keep a tire properly inflated. The safety administration collected its data on tire-tread wear at 300 service stations; while there, it checked the air pumps. While more than 90 percent of the stations had pumps, nearly 10 percent were out of order. Of those that worked, fewer than half had tire-pressure gauges for customer use.
It is also possible, the agency found, for a vigilant driver to be misled by pressure gauges built into pumps. At the pressure levels typical for cars and S.U.V.'s, nearly 10 percent of the pumps overstated a tire's pressure by 6 p.s.i. or more. Twenty percent overstated the pressure by 4 p.s.i. or more.
Only 139 of the 300 stations surveyed had both working air pumps and working tire-pressure gauges.
The obvious solution would be for motorists to buy a gauge, for $2 or so. (Fancy ones cost $20 or more, but the agency staff said they were not any better.) Gauges are available at auto-parts and hardware stores, but are hard to find at gas stations, where the only pencil-shaped item displayed near the cashier is often beef jerky.
Dr. Runge saw this as another sign of the problem. "This is a market economy," he said. "I'm sure that if you had a big demand for tire gauges, anybody would be happy to sell you one. It's more evidence that consumers have failed to create a demand for tire gauges, or, for that matter, functioning air pumps."
Underinflated tires can result in tread separation and blowouts. In the case of Explorers, the tire failures tended to flip the vehicles. Underinflation also makes the tire wear faster and wastes gasoline.
Overinflation, which was also possible because of bad tire gauges, wears out tires faster, too, and makes the ride rougher.
And bald tires provide less traction. Dr. Runge's agency is beginning a public service campaign that urges drivers to check tire pressure and tread wear; for the latter, it gives the time-honored method of sticking a penny into the tread. If the top of Lincoln's head is visible, it is time to replace the tire.
The surveys found that bald tires were 50 to 80 percent more likely to be underinflated than tires with an acceptable amount of tread. A spokesman for the Rubber Manufacturers Association, Daniel Zielinski, said this was because "people who drive around on bald tires are probably not checking their tires at all."
One long-term solution is a system built into the car that warns when the tires are low. But Dr. Runge said it would take many years before all cars had those, and besides, he said, they are not as effective as a $2 gauge.
Stung by the Explorer problem, Ford now builds tire monitors into some vehicles. New Windstar minivans are equipped with a low-tire-warning system, which includes an amber dashboard warning light shaped like a cross-section of a radial tire with an exclamation point in the middle. But a recent test by a reporter suggested that pressure changes registered only if they were quite sharp and sustained.
With three tires pumped up to 35 p.s.i., the maximum recommended inflation stated on a sticker on the pillar behind the driver's door, I let 5 pounds of air out of the left rear tire, as measured by my $1.99 pencil-type pressure gauge, and drove a few minutes. I repeated this exercise three times, in an effort to activate the warning. At 20 p.s.i., with the warning symbol still unlighted, I gave up and pumped the tire back up.
The Windstar owner's manual warns, "The low tire warning system may not detect an underinflated tire under all conditions and is not a substitute for manually checking tires regularly for proper inflation." It can be thrown off by uneven tread wear, driving on gravel or snow, driving less than 10 miles -- in truth, I drove only a couple of miles -- and driving with two tires deflated at the same time.
The reason is that the system measures pressure only indirectly; it uses the antilock brake components to count the number of times the wheel turns. If one wheel turns more than another, it concludes that the faster wheel has a smaller circumference, a sign of less air pressure. Other designs measure pressure directly and transmit the information back to the dashboard.

HEADLINE: Warmer Isn't Better 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Warming Up to the Notion of Warming" (Big City column, Dec. 7), John Tierney repeats the conclusion of Robert O. Mendelsohn, an economist, that global warming won't be so bad for New York. But the researchers and agency representatives who participated with me in a recent assessment agree that the trend poses serious challenges for the region. 
 The effects will be widespread but uneven, with the greatest impact on the elderly, the poor and those in coastal areas. Storm surges may threaten infrastructure. Other problems include deaths from heat and increased summer energy demands that will affect air quality and costs. 
 The most severe effects will come later this century, but planning and prevention should start now. Fortunately, decision makers in the area are embracing the concept.

HEADLINE: Give the Afghans A Hand 

BYLINE:  By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF; E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan 

 BODY:
To fight Afghan terrorism, I got a haircut.
 A dozen barbers were lined up on the cracked sidewalk near the Kabul market, and one of them, Jalad Khan, said he had once worked inside a real barbershop before it (along with much of the country's economy) went broke. The price was right: 2,000 afghani, or 6 cents. 
 So I squatted down on a wooden stool that Mr. Khan set out on the sidewalk, and he pulled out an ancient pair of scissors. A crowd gathered, for entertainment possibilities in Kabul are few and there was always some hope that the foreigner might lose an ear. 
It was a great haircut! It was better than $20 cuts I've had in New York, although I appreciate that Americans are unlikely to fly to Kabul for 6-cent haircuts. Not to make too much of a trim, but one lesson that emerged broadly from my visits to factories and shops in Afghanistan is that the country's economy is not hopeless, and it can begin to compete internationally -- especially on price.
It will need to, if terrorism is to be defeated in this part of the world. To prevent future Osama bin Ladens from arising, we need to see economic development to lift living standards and create viable countries.
A growing body of evidence suggests that civil wars and terrorism arise in part from economic roots. An important study last year by the World Bank, for example, suggested that among the best ways to prevent civil war (which, as in Afghanistan and Somalia, often spawns terrorism) is to promote economic growth and in particular manufacturing, so as to diversify economies away from dependence on commodities. 
There is a landmark step we could take to fight terrorism: Announce our willingness to work toward a free-trade area encompassing Afghanistan, Pakistan and the United States. We already have several such free-trade agreements and are negotiating others. Just this month one will enter into force with Jordan, and it is an excellent model.
In this case, Pakistan and Afghanistan would have to open their economies, solidifying them on a course toward free markets and, ultimately, greater political stability. India would be offended by any trade preference for Pakistan but could be invited to join in the future, and India too has a powerful interest in the emergence of a Pakistan that is more stable and more integrated into the world economy.
Afghanistan's economy may seem a lost cause, capable of producing nothing but opium. But Afghanistan has the tastiest melons and pomegranates in the world, and its wages are only about 90 cents a day for an ordinary worker, so it can compete in labor-intensive industries.
Moreover, many Afghans are born entrepreneurs. I heard about several men who set out dozens of lanterns in a field during the American bombing of Kabul. They hoped the Americans would mistake the lights for a Taliban site and bomb it, allowing them to collect high-grade metal from the bomb to sell as scrap in Pakistan. 
In Kabul, I visited a factory where 30 workers produce plastic shoes that sell for about 55 cents a pair. In Pakistan such shoes sell for $1.90 a pair, but the factory cannot export because of prohibitive Pakistani duties. A free-trade area could help this factory and spawn many others.
There is, however, a reason that this kind of trade arrangement will probably never happen: American protectionism. America's textile mills have so far blocked proposals to lower tariffs on Pakistani clothing, and they would shriek at the prospect of a free-trade area -- even though Afghanistan and Pakistan make cheap rugs and shirts that do not compete with American-made goods. 
When Pakistan's leader, Pervez Musharraf, meets with Colin Powell and asks for help in staving off the threat of a radical Islamic revolution in his country, don't think that he is asking for riot-control equipment. Rather, he pleads for lower tariffs. He knows that the best way to stabilize the region is to bolster trade -- but Congress, which has been unyielding on tariffs, has been too shortsighted to recognize this.
The political reality is that the United States is willing to sacrifice lives and budgets for a military campaign to defeat terrorism, but unwilling to take more modest steps on the economic front. Granted, fighting terrorism with trade and economic development is not as satisfying as dropping bombs on Taliban tanks, but in the long run it is more important.

HEADLINE: New Claims for Unemployment Hit Lowest Level Since Sept. 11 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 13 

 BODY:
The number of workers filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell last week to the lowest level since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the government reported today, suggesting that the job market may be improving.
 A separate report showed that retail sales declined last month as auto purchases fell from a record pace and consumers turned to discounters to save money. 
 New jobless claims fell 86,000, to 394,000, in the week ended Saturday, the Labor Department reported. The last time initial claims fell as much was the week ended Aug. 1, 1992, when auto workers were returning from a two-week shutdown at General Motors plants. 
"The labor markets are stabilizing and the consumer is continuing to spend, which points to the possibility for the recovery to start early in 2002," said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisers in Holland, Pa.
Retail sales declined 3.7 percent in November, the largest drop in almost 10 years of comparable data, the Commerce Department said. The decline came after a record 6.4 percent rise in October.
Wal-Mart, Costco and other discounters lured shoppers trying to balance the holiday season with concerns about job security.
"Consumers are being smart," said Oscar Gonzalez, an economist at John Hancock Financial Services in Boston. "They haven't stopped shopping. They've only stopped buying everything in sight, and they've stopped paying full price."
The value of sales at gasoline stations fell as prices reached a two-year low. Sales increased 0.1 percent last month at retailers other than auto dealers and gas stations, after a 1.7 percent increase in October. 
A third report showed that prices paid to factories, farmers and other producers fell in November, led by declines in gasoline, beef and dairy products. The Producer Price Index dropped 0.6 percent, the Labor Department said, after falling a record 1.6 percent in October.

HEADLINE: Fed Policy Panel Debated How Large a RateCut 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 13 

 BODY:
Members of the Federal Reserve's interest-rate-setting panel debated how much to cut rates at their meeting on Nov. 6 before agreeing to a reduction of half a percentage point, according to meeting minutes released today.
 "A number of members noted that the choice between 25 and 50 basis points of easing was a close call," the minutes said. 
 While the vote to ease rates by a half-point was 10 to 0, the disclosure of the debate may add to speculation in the financial markets that the Fed is close to ending its cycle of rate cuts. It made a smaller quarter-point cut at its most recent meeting on Tuesday. The federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks now stands at 1.75 percent, the lowest level since 1961.
In the minutes of the November meeting, members of the panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, that favored a smaller cut did so because they thought monetary policy was already "accommodative." They feared a larger cut would lead markets to "build in inappropriate expectations" for additional cuts.
Those favoring a half-point reduction said there was little evidence that the economy was stabilizing in the aftermath of the attacks on Sept. 11. They also worried that not easing enough "would risk a more extended contraction of the economy and possibly even downward pressure on prices that could be difficult to counter with the current federal funds rate already quite low."
Looking ahead, the F.O.M.C members thought that the economy was likely to rebound in 2002, the minutes said. But the strength and timing of that rebound were seen as depending on proposed fiscal stimulus legislation, the fight against terrorism and economic conditions abroad.

HEADLINE: Pataki Promises Transit Fare Will Not Rise Next Year 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

 BODY:
Despite deepening financial woes at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Gov. George E. Pataki pledged yesterday that there would be no fare increase next year, and that the state would help the agency balance its budget. 
 "We're not going to do it," Mr. Pataki told reporters about the prospect of a fare increase. "It would just be the wrong thing." 
 The M.T.A. faces a 2002 budget shortfall of up to $800 million, a result of falling ridership due to the recession and the Sept. 11 attacks. Authority officials say some of that could be eliminated through cost cutting, but the state would still have to supply hundreds of millions of dollars. It is unclear how Albany will come up with the money, at a time when the state faces its own deficit and budget cuts. "Yes, it's going to be hard, but as we try to revive the economy in the aftermath of Sept. 11, as we try to encourage more people to come to town, to come downtown, this is not the time to have a fare hike," said Michael McKeon, the governor's communications director.
As the governor runs for re-election next year, a fare increase could be politically disastrous for him. The M.T.A. includes the city's subway and bus system as well as the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North.
When Mr. Pataki took office, he raided the transit network's reserve fund and made deep cuts in aid to the system. That helped bring on a fare increase in 1995, the system's last to date, and has forced the authority to go much more deeply into debt to pay for capital improvements like new subway trains and a planned Long Island Rail Road link to Grand Central Terminal.

2 Weak Forecasts in Technology Push Equities Lower

BYLINE:  By SHERRI DAY 

 BODY:
Stocks fell sharply yesterday on renewed fears about the health of the economy after two technology bellwethers, Lucent Technologies and Ciena, forecast unexpected weakness in their financial results, and the government reported a steep drop in retail sales in November.
 "The market and especially the Nasdaq went down because of the comments out of Ciena and Lucent," said Tony Rosenthal, a money manager at TimesSquare Capital Management. "All of technology had been doing well for October, November and half of December, but those companies that have exposure to telecom are going to have difficulties in 2002. Their turnaround is going to happen much later than a turnaround in the overall general economy." 
 Owen Fitzpatrick, who leads the United States equity group at Deutsche Bank Private Banking, said the latest financial warnings unnerved investors, who had previously come to believe that the worst might be over since many earnings forecasts had already been severely ratcheted down. 
"The thought process was that we've come far enough." Mr. Fitzpatrick said. "I think Ciena and Lucent, and two days ago, Merck, show that this is not the case." 
The Nasdaq composite index dropped 64.87 points, or 3.2 percent, to 1,946.51. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 128.36 points, or 1.3 percent, to 9,766.45. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 17.69 points, or 1.6 percent, to 1,119.38.
Shares of Lucent, the telecommunications equipment maker, plunged $1.21, to $6.52, after the company said it would post a first-quarter loss from continuing operations of 23 cents to 26 cents a share. Analysts had predicted a loss of 17 cents a share, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. 
Ciena, an optical networking company, plummeted $3.03, to $14.94, after it said it expected sales in the first quarter to decrease 30 to 40 percent, possibly resulting in an operating loss for the year. The company also posted a net loss of $1.8 billion, or $5.51 a share, for the fourth quarter, in contrast to a profit of $25.8 million, or 9 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. 
The warnings from Lucent and Ciena sent other telecommunications equipment stocks reeling. Cisco Systems fell $1.49, to $19.01; JDS Uniphase lost $1.14, to $8.71; Nortel Networks slipped 95 cents, to $7.43; and Qualcomm declined $2.67, to $55.
The S.& P. communications index dropped 11.7 points, or 8.75 percent, to 121.64.
Qwest Communications fell 30 cents, to $11.80, after it issued a profit warning and said that it would cut 7,000 jobs.
Applied Materials, a maker of semiconductor equipment, said it planned to shed 1,700 jobs. Its stock fell $3.79, to $41.08, on the news and was an albatross for other semiconductor issues. The Philadelphia semiconductor index dropped 39.03 points, or 6.8 percent, to 536.59.
Shares of Immunex, a biotechnology company, rose $2.51, to $26.96, after its rival Amgen was reported to be considering a bid for the company. The proposed takeover by Amgen was expected to be valued at about $18 billion in stock and cash, people close to the companies said. Shares of Amgen dropped $4.20, to $60.19.
After the market closed, Oracle, a leading software maker, reported a 12 percent decline in net income, to $549.5 million, or 10 cents a share, for its fiscal second quarter, meeting expectations. But the company missed analysts' revenue projections, reporting sales of $2.36 billion compared with forecasts of $2.5 billion. Shares of Oracle, which dropped 43 cents, to $14.67, in regular trading, fell an additional 32 cents, to $14.35, after hours, according to Instinet.
Investors were also unnerved by a spate of negative economic reports, which pointed to continuing economic weakness. Retail sales dropped 3.7 percent in November, as consumers spent far less than in October, when sales surged 6.4 percent, the Commerce Department said. --------------------

Treasury Prices Fall
(By Bloomberg News)
Bonds fell for the first day in four yesterday, as a drop in jobless claims dampened speculation the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates next month.
The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 18/32, to 99 14/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.07 percent from 5 percent. The 30-year bond fell 18/32, to 98 1/32. Its yield rose to 5.51 percent from 5.47 percent.

HEADLINE: Congress Takes Small Steps on Economic Aid 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 13 

 BODY:
Democrats and Republicans in Congress pressed ahead today with negotiations on an economic recovery package, seeking to overcome substantive differences even as they positioned themselves to avoid blame if their efforts failed.
 The negotiators said they intended to try to narrow their differences over the next few days in the hope of coming up with a compromise that could be voted on before Congress finishes its work for the year next week. 
 Democrats continued to demand more assistance to laid-off workers and Republicans insisted on income tax cuts for middle income people and above. While they reported some progress, the two sides remained far enough apart on important details that neither was ready to predict that a deal could be reached. 
Members of the two parties said it was likely that the talks, which have included representatives from the Bush administration, would go on through the weekend. With unemployment rising sharply, neither party wants to be seen as putting political advantage ahead of helping the economy and the people who have been hurt by the recession.
The two sides were in general agreement about some components of the plan. They include providing one-time payments of $300 per person to low-income workers who did not qualify for the rebate checks sent out this summer; tax incentives for businesses to spur more investment in new factories and equipment; and an extension of unemployment benefits by 13 weeks beyond the current 26-week limit.
But Republicans were resisting calls by Democrats for an enhanced program to subsidize health insurance premiums for workers who have lost their jobs. And Democrats were blocking the No. 1 priority of the White House and Congressional Republicans, dropping the 27 percent personal income tax rate to 25 percent immediately instead of phasing it in over the next five years.
Democrats are also trying to kill or scale back a Republican proposal to reduce the corporate alternative minimum tax.
"There is very little chance that we could agree to the full rate-reduction acceleration that the Republicans have suggested, nor could we agree" with their alternative minimum tax, said Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic majority leader. 
Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman, suggested that much of the responsibility for getting a deal rested with Mr. Daschle and the Democratic-controlled Senate, which the White House has portrayed as obstructionist.

HEADLINE: Law on Mortgages Is Expanded 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 13 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve Board has expanded the scope of a 1994 law aimed at preventing the growth of what is known as predatory mortgage lending without making all the changes consumer groups sought. 
 The Fed has revised the Home Equity Ownership and Equity Protection Act to extend the 1994 law's consumer protections to more high-cost mortgages. 
 Currently, 12.4 percent of "subprime" first mortgages, those made to borrowers with tarnished credit, are subject to the law. When the changes take effect on Oct. 1, 2002, 38 percent of such loans will be covered.
"The rules are a measured response that balances various concerns so as not to impede the growth of the legitimate subprime mortgage market," said Edward Gramlich, a Federal Reserve governor.
Predatory lending involves loans with excessive or hidden fees or a mortgage refinancing that does not help the consumer.
The subprime loans market has grown to $140 billion in loans in 2000 from $65 billion in 1995, according to Inside Mortgage Finance, an industry publication. The rise of the subprime loan market has led to a growth in predatory lending.
The Fed "didn't come through on everything we wanted, but on whole, the proposal represents a step forward," said Allen Fishbein, executive director of the Center for Community Change, a housing advocacy group in Washington. 
The Fed lowered a threshold that requires certain consumer warnings and disclosures for high-cost mortgage refinancings, or those with interest rates and fees 10 percentage points above comparable Treasury securities. The Fed lowered that trigger point to 8 percent above Treasury securities.

HEADLINE: Cuba Leads Latin America in Primary Education, Study Finds 

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 13 

 BODY:
Cuba, a Marxist nation with profound economic difficulties, leads Latin America in primary education, a regional task force has found.
 In test scores, completion rates and literacy levels, Cuban primary students are at or near the top of a list of peers from across Latin America, the task force reported. 
 Indeed, the performance of Cuban third and fourth graders in math and language so dramatically outstripped that of other nations that the United Nations agency administering the test returned to Cuba and tested students again, according to a coordinator of the study. 
"They went back to Cuba and retested because there was some anomaly," said Jeff Puryear, the co-director of the Partnership for Educational Revitalization in the Americas, which helped organize the task force. "This is a good, solid, reliable comparison."
The task force highlighted the results of the first region-wide test of primary students, which was administered in 1998 by the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization, or Unesco.
"Cuba far and away led the region in third- and fourth-grade mathematics and language achievement," the panel said. "Even the lowest fourth of Cubans students performed above the regional average."
Cuba's educational system, along with health care, has been a priority of the government of President Fidel Castro since the early days of the revolution four decades ago. 
Critics say Mr. Castro has used education as a tool for political indoctrination. In the past, first-grade reading textbooks have included such revolutionary slogans as "Study, Work, Rifle," and the government frequently mobilizes young students for political demonstrations.
The findings are especially remarkable since the island has lived under an American economic embargo for decades and lost its Soviet patron -- and billions of dollars in subsidies -- a decade ago, plunging Cubans into a period of austerity, blackouts and food shortages. Government planners say they have diverted funds from other areas to bolster schools and hospitals, which nonetheless have deteriorated.
"The question is whether Cuba is going to be able to sustain that system over time," said Peter Hakim, the president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington-based forum of hemisphere leaders, which co-sponsored the study.
Resources alone do not explain Cuba's success. Most nations of the hemisphere spend more public money per student than Cuba's allocation of less than $1,000. The United States spends more than $6,000 per student, while Chile, Mexico and Brazil all exceed $1,000, the study said.
"It does show that countries with low levels of national income can still establish quality education for their children," Mr. Hakim said. 
Some analysts speculated that Cuba's ruined economy has the paradoxical effect of stacking the schools with good teachers. According to that argument, opportunities are so limited that many would-be entrepreneurs and professionals have little recourse but to teach.
The findings for the rest of Latin America were grim. The study, which is to be presented Friday by the president of the Inter-American Development Bank, reported that quality remains low, inequality remains high and few schools are accountable to parents and local communities.

HEADLINE: Hotels Expect Tough Times Next Year 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
They are packing them in for the holidays at the Regent on Park Avenue and at the Royalton on 44th Street, as local hotels rebound from a calamitous fall, but Manhattan operators still foresee a tough year as international travelers continue to avoid New York.
 The Waldorf-Astoria, the Essex House, the St. Regis, the Four Seasons and other luxury hotels have cut their rates sharply in a fairly successful attempt to lure customers back to their rooms, after the attack on the World Trade Center left many people fearful of coming to New York. 
 With their hotels nearly full on at least some nights, Ian Schrager, Jonathan M. Tisch and other Manhattan hoteliers said that it was almost like old times. As a result, about half of the 3,400 hotel workers laid off in September and October after the World Trade Center attacks are back at work, said Peter Ward, president of the Hotel Trades Council, which represents union workers. 
But he does not expect the rebound to last.
"They're very busy right now," Mr. Ward said. "But we expect them to be laid off again in January. We're hearing that January and February are going to be bad months."
According to a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the New York hotel industry will finish this year with an average occupancy of 73.3 percent, down 10 points from a high in 2000 to the lowest level since the recession in 1993. But in good news for hotel patrons and bad news for hotel owners, the average room rate at Manhattan hotels has fallen to $191.70, from a record of $222.37 in 2000.
Sean Hennessey, a hotel analyst and a director of PricewaterhouseCoopers, said he expected that 2002 would wind up at about the same occupancy levels and room rates as this year.
"Next year will continue to be very tough for the hotel industry in New York, even though revenues will be flat," Mr. Hennessey said. "We expect business to be worse in the first half of the year but to pick up in the second half. Still, that'll create a lot of financial pressure on hotels. There are a number of hotels that don't have a cushion to weather the bad times."
Mr. Hennessey said that expensive new hotels and boutique hotels that did not have national reservation networks might face financial difficulties as occupancy and room rates declined.
Next month, four hotels, with a total of 1,166 rooms, are expected to open: the W Times Square hotel on West 44th Street and Broadway; two Ritz-Carlton properties, one on Central Park South and one at Battery Park City; and the City Club on West 44th Street, between Fifth Avenue and the Avenue of the Americas. Next fall, the Westin New York at Times Square, with 850 rooms, plans to open at Eighth Avenue and 43rd Street.
The recent decline in room rates has been most significant at some of the city's fancier hotels. The price of a room at the Peninsula Hotel on Fifth Avenue fell to $410 a night from $580 a year earlier, according to one hotel executive. Meanwhile, a room at the Waldorf-Astoria could be had for $238, or $119 less than in 2000.
"Occupancy is up to pre-Sept. 11 levels," said Mr. Schrager, who owns the Royalton, Henry Hudson and Paramount hotels. "But everyone's rates have gone into free fall."
The problem, hotel analysts said, is that profits evaporate faster than revenues. And it may take years for hotels to get back to 2000 rate levels.
Of course, hotel owners have had seven strong years in which they raised room rates at a fast clip, well in excess of inflation. The average daily rate at Manhattan hotels jumped 79 percent in the 1990's, to $222.37 in 2000 from $124.11 in 1992. A surge in business travelers and domestic and international tourists kept most hotels effectively full for most of the year.
Earlier this year, hotel operators began to feel the effects of an economic slowdown and began offering modest discounts to attract travelers. But after the terrorist attack on Sept. 11, business all but collapsed, as nearly two-thirds of the city's hotel rooms sat empty.
Not only were European, Asian and South American tourists nervous about flying into New York, but corporate executives also cut back and negotiated discounts.
Mr. Tisch, chairman of Loews Hotels, said that the company's flagship, the 360-room Regency, was having a good month because it had a loyal group of domestic customers. But, he said, the Metropolitan, a 720-room hotel at Lexington Avenue and 51st Street, has suffered from the loss of international travelers.
"International travel is way off and is projected to remain down next year," Mr. Tisch said. "The international traveler spends six times what the domestic traveler spends. That has implications for Broadway shows, restaurants and retailing. It paints a troublesome picture for the first half of the year."

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about economic prospects for New York hotels in the coming year misstated the name of one on Park Avenue that has many guests for the holidays. It is the Regency, not the Regent.

HEADLINE: An Illinois Tire Plant Closes and a Way of Life Fades 

BYLINE:  By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: DECATUR, Ill., Dec. 13 

 BODY:
Steve Collins is a skilled tire builder. For 17 of his 22 years at the Firestone plant here, he worked nights. His wife has not worked for 13 years, since the second of three children was born. On his wages, now $23 an hour or about $46,000 a year, he said, "I built the house, got the toys -- the boat, the cars." 
 But when the factory closes for good on Friday, Mr. Collins will be among 1,500 Firestone workers who will be out of jobs. When the last tire leaves the two-million-square-foot plant, Mr. Collins, 45, will be just three months short of the 23 years he needs for a full and immediate pension and lifetime health insurance. 
 It is more than a year since some models of Firestone tires, most made in Decatur, were cited in the rollover deaths of at least 271 occupants of sport utility vehicles, mostly Fords. A federal government analysis found that the tires were defective, and that their treads could separate during use. Millions of tires were recalled. 
The Ford Motor Company, the Bridgestone Corporation of Japan and its Bridgestone/Firestone subsidiary, based in Nashville, dispute the causes of the rollovers. And after the rollovers, the 90-year association between Ford and Firestone came to an end. But workers, who have never been implicated, see themselves and their plant as the scapegoats. 
"It's a slap in the face," said Bobbe Mathews, whose husband, Jesse, is a tire builder. "I know he makes good tires."
Roger Gates, president of Local 713 of the United Steelworkers of America, the plant's union, said: "Tires do fail. But when tires fail, vehicles shouldn't turn over and kill somebody." 
However commonplace the jolts of plant closings have become for American communities, the shuttering of the 38-year-old factory here seems a case apart. The usual reasons -- competition from cheaper imports and American companies moving production abroad -- do not apply, because American factories still hold their own in making tires. 
Bridgestone bought Firestone in 1988 and operates nine other North American tire plants. Earlier this year, it was refurbishing this plant. 
"Everything was looking positive then," said John McQuade, vice president for manufacturing at Bridgestone/Firestone in Nashville. 
Then the economy intruded. The Decatur plant, already about 25 years old when Firestone bought it, became a victim of the stalled economy's sagging tire market. "It was the oldest and smallest plant," Mr. McQuade said, "so it became pretty obvious to move its production elsewhere." The rollovers had nothing to do with the decision, he added.
About 1,000 of the plant's workers are in the same situation as Mr. Collins: short of a full pension and health insurance for life. Instead, these workers will get two years of health insurance and at 55, they can start collecting part of their pension, typically 40 percent.
"I'll find a job, construction maybe," Mr. Collins said.
Decatur, population 81,860 last year, down 2,025 from 1990, is an unabashedly muscular community of ranch houses, backyard sheds and chain-link fences. Its skyscrapers are smokestacks. Without a Starbucks, a Borders or a Banana Republic, Decatur's shopping strips cater to middle incomes and below. 
With contracts negotiated by Local 713, Firestone workers like Mr. Collins and Mr. Mathews could own houses, raise families on one income and plan to send children to college or to well-paid industrial jobs.
But with the closing, old aspirations are fading fast. "The Great American Dream is to buy a five-year-old car," said Mike Hassinger, 51, who for 30 years drove a fork-lift truck at Firestone.
With $6 to $8 an hour, mostly part-time jobs proliferating in stores, restaurants and motels, and more well-paid health care jobs, "our latest survey shows more white-collar jobs than blue collar for the first time," Mayor Terry Howley said. 
"I was the youngest guy at Firestone when I started," said Larry James, 60, who retired with a full pension in October, after 38 years. A quality control inspector, he held shop floor jobs, then salaried, necktie jobs, then factory jobs again. 
"I got married at 21," he said. "I had a son about eight months later and two years after that another son." At 24, Mr. James bought a house. He sold it six years ago and built another. "I got my sons through college," he said. For amusement now he hunts birds and mushrooms.
Workers here are angry in part because they accommodated the shifting production demands that, they were assured, would keep the plant running and help Firestone stay competitive. To end the big strike in 1996, they gave up the eight-hour work day. 
"We worked 12-hour days -- two days on, two days off, then three on and two off, then two on and three off," said Doug Chandler, 47. The new scheduling meant everyone had to work every other weekend.
Dick Cours, 64, recoiled at the changed family and daily routines, so he retired when the new schedule took effect. These days he hunts mushrooms with Mr. James.
Tim Ternous, 44, a painter at the plant, has no such agreeable options. Burned once before with the closing of a coal mine in Colleen, Ill., he has worked for Firestone for only 14 years, so he still needs a wage. "I'll probably have to hit the road somewhere," he said.

Arab Leaders Call on World To Contain Israel's Advances

BYLINE:  By SUSAN SACHS

DATELINE: CAIRO, Dec. 13 

 BODY:
Arab leaders today renewed their demands for an international force to protect Palestinians and their institutions from renewed Israeli bombardment, warning that the violence may spin out of control with or without Yasir Arafat.
 The Egyptian foreign minister, Ahmed Maher, said Israel's decision to cut ties with the Palestinian leader signaled that it had chosen aggression over negotiations. 
 "I hope now that the world realizes that it is time to step in very strongly against the policies of the Israeli government," Mr. Maher said. "It is only through negotiations with the elected leader of the Palestinian people that there could be security, not by trying to weaken him." 
Arab leaders have repeatedly warned that a failure to resolve the Palestinian-Israeli conflict could ultimately lead to a wider regional conflict. But none would seem to be in a position to go to war, if for no other reason than to avoid antagonizing the United States and Europe. 
Two of Israel's neighbors, Egypt and Jordan, have signed peace treaties and depend on American aid. Lebanon and Syria, which also border Israel, are in deep economic trouble and have been trying to attract European aid and investment. 
In general, Arab officials seemed at a loss about what they could do other than plead for help from beyond the Middle East. 
Amr Moussa, the general secretary of the Arab League, said a working group on the Palestinian conflict would meet in early January. He also called for an urgent meeting of the United Nations Security Council, saying he had been telephoning Mr. Arafat, Arab foreign ministers and European Union officials all day to discuss the latest Israeli attacks. 
But Mr. Moussa, clearly angry, called on the United States to intervene and salvage the peace process.
"The United States must decide on the ways to save their peace efforts, if they have the will," he said. 
Neither Syria nor the Persian Gulf states, which have had the rockiest relationships with Mr. Arafat, publicly commented on his predicament. 
Others expressed concern that the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, may want to destroy the Palestinian Authority and its institutions, which represent the Palestinians' hopes for a state of their own. 
"I don't think Sharon will get rid of the Palestinian Authority," said Taher el-Masri, a former Jordanian foreign minister whose family had been prominent West Bank landowners for years. "This is still a red line for every international group. But will he get rid of Arafat? Maybe."
Mr. Arafat himself is far from popular with his fellow Arab leaders, who refer to him in private as a volatile man who has a tendency to choose the right stand but at the wrong time. 
But they have also watched in alarm as militant groups like Hamas and Islamic Jihad have grown more defiant during the past year's uprising against Israeli occupation. So they have rallied around Mr. Arafat as an essential moderate counterweight to the fundamentalists.
In an interview published today, King Abdullah of Jordan said he worried that Hamas has cast itself as a political alternative to Mr. Arafat and the Palestinian Authority.
"I am very concerned that these developments will push the situation into a civil war on the West Bank and Gaza," the king said.
In the past when fighting became intense, thousands of Palestinians fled from the West Bank into Jordan, where at least half the population is of Palestinian origin. If another exodus begins, King Abdullah told the newspaper Asharq Al Awsat, Jordan would close the bridges that span the Jordan River. 
Much of the Arab media has cast the Israeli actions of the past week as a personal settling of scores by Mr. Sharon, who directed the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982 that led to Mr. Arafat's expulsion to Tunisia. 
In an interview published today in the Kuwaiti newspaper Al Rai Al A'am, Mr. Arafat also called it a personal battle between old foes.
"He tried to expel me from Beirut, and here I am back in Gaza, Ramallah, Nablus, Hebron and all the West Bank," Mr. Arafat said. "Sharon either forgets history easily or he never learns from it."

HEADLINE: Port Authority Approves New PATH Station for Lower Manhattan 

BYLINE:  By RONALD SMOTHERS 

 BODY:
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey yesterday authorized spending $544 million to build a temporary PATH station in Lower Manhattan beneath the rubble of the World Trade Center.
 The temporary terminal could be completed within two years, said officials of the agency. It would help directly reconnect downtown to the rest of the PATH system for the more than 65,000 commuters who used the Lower Manhattan station before the Sept. 11 attack, which destroyed the trade center and the underground network of train tunnels and shopping concourses there. 
 In addition, the agency's board of commissioners allotted $10 million yesterday to plan an ambitious, permanent PATH terminal in the area -- one that would establish better and more connections to city subways, buses and ferry terminals.
Chris Ward, the director of planning and external affairs for the port agency, said planning for the permanent station and all the needed interconnections would require tight coordination with city government and New York State transit agencies. He acknowledged that in the past such regional coordination had been difficult, marred by concerns about maintaining local control.
"What has changed is the attack of Sept. 11 and the loss of the system and the interrelationships it did have," said Mr. Ward, adding that the agency and New York transit officials were working well together. "That event has laid bare the interrelationship between the New York and New Jersey economies and how neither can survive without the other."
Gov. George E. Pataki said earlier yesterday that the plan for a temporary station would help renew the spirit of the city, while the longer-term plan for a permanent station would result in "a downtown that is even stronger and more dynamic" than it was before the attack.
The port agency will work closely with the recently created Lower Manhattan Redevelopment Corporation, which is also working on creating a permanent memorial to those killed in the attack, the governor said.
Currently, PATH trains from New Jersey into Manhattan can use only one of the system's two trans-Hudson tubes -- the one from Hoboken. That train makes its southernmost Manhattan stop at Christopher Street in Greenwich Village.
As part of the temporary terminal plan, the agency would remove water from the tunnel connecting Jersey City with the twin towers site and reopen it to trains, as well as improve access at two other Manhattan PATH stations and two New Jersey stations.
Even as the agency was taking the step to re-establish the PATH terminal, its staff and commissioners were pondering the impact the attack had had on the once vigorous revenues that flowed from its ownership of the twin towers and operation of the region's three airports.
Officials involved in the discussions say the board is now considering deferring some $250 million of its $9.5 billion, five-year capital plan. That plan includes everything from dredging the harbor channels and expanding airport facilities to buying new PATH trains and building additional bridge crossings between New York and New Jersey.
The agency is projecting a 23 percent decline in operating revenues this year while it expects a nearly 45 percent increase in the cost of security at all of its operations.

Just See the Way They Play Games

 BODY:
A COLLEGE basketball game is scheduled for tomorrow night in Uncasville, Conn., at the Mohegan Sun, not a campus but a gambling casino. The University of Massachusetts will be "visiting" Central Connecticut State in an arena adjoined by the clanging of slot machines, raising the obvious question of what's wrong with this picture?
 Nothing, say the participating schools and the casino people. 
 Something, says the National Collegiate Athletic Association. 
Everything, says an expert in the field of compulsive gambling and related addictions.
"College basketball in a gambling casino -- what a sad, sad state of affairs," said Arnie Wexler, whose passionate voice on gambling addiction has long been heard, on campuses and elsewhere, and who operates a national hotline and South Florida treatment facility with his wife, Sheila.
They still call the players amateurs, but only those living in Tora Bora for the last 40 years don't know that to understand big-time collegiate sports one must follow the money. According to Charles Jones, the Central Connecticut State athletic director, that Northeast Conference school had been looking for a game, preferably at home, against an opponent from a larger conference -- in this case, from the Atlantic 10 -- to raise its Division I profile.
"Our options are limited in terms of expanding our schedule," Jones said. "We have a small gym and a school like UMass is just not going to come to Central Connecticut State.
"Frankly, we also don't stand too much of a chance of beating a team like that on the road, but we have a large Connecticut alumni base and I think we have a shot against them in a new arena that seats 10,000 like the one at Mohegan Sun."
Why not book the Hartford Civic Center, as does the University of Connecticut, and shoot for a crowd of 20,000?
"We can't afford to lease the Civic Center," Jones said.
And here is where the symbolism at least and potential perils of such a marriage at worst are forgotten while the temptation of mutual back-scratching prevails. According to Paul Munich of the Mohegan Sun, the arena, which opened in October to a preseason pro game between the Washington Wizards and Boston Celtics, is not being leased for tomorrow night's game, nor for the men's and women's doubleheader later this month featuring Clemson and Hartford. 
"We pay them a guarantee," Munich said. In return, Mohegan Sun draws a few thousand people into its adjoining restaurants, shops and, duh, its casino. 
Is it morally wrong for a casino -- even one that has no sports bookmaking and an age requirement of 21 -- to be offering itself as a host environment for impressionable and vulnerable basketball players? Munich, who formerly ran the college basketball program at Madison Square Garden and knows the score on college sports, said, "We're not the ones making millions of dollars off 17- and 18-year-olds."
By the same token, if a few hundred 21-year-old students with mom and dad's credit cards happen to find their way into the casino after the game, well, no laws will technically be broken.
"Most coaches will tell you that a far greater threat is the Internet, which these kids can do right out of their dorm room," said Bob Marcum, the UMass athletic director. As for his team, he is convinced none of his players will be sneaking hands of blackjack. They'll be spending the night at the Marriott over in Mystic.
"But we've played in Atlantic City," he said. "We stayed in at a casino in Las Vegas. Let's face it, we're surrounded by gambling, as far as casinos and state lotteries go."
Jones of Central Connecticut added, "These casinos contribute a lot to the Connecticut economy."
As evidenced above, rationalizations were rampant when I called to ask about the game, except in William Sawn's office in Indianapolis. Sawn, who oversees the N.C.A.A.'s gambling prevention and security, said the schools were given the standard line when they called to inquire on the propriety of the game. As far as the regular season is concerned, member schools are free to play wherever they choose. As for casino bookings, we'd rather you not.
"There are plenty of studies that show our student-athletes are more at risk when they are challenged by the high visibility of gambling," Sawn said. "They are elite athletes who are used to winning, used to taking chances."
He doesn't blame the casino for trying to do business. The schools, on the other hand, are supposed to educate their students, not send what he called "a mixed message."
Back in South Florida, Arnie Wexler argued that there is nothing mixed in the message sent by playing at a casino. It's another surrender for the sake of a buck.
"These schools will sell their souls to the devil if it brings them money, and the N.C.A.A. is full of it," he said. "They're all just worried about kids fixing games and making the media think they care. They don't want to know about prevention. If they did, there would be rules against games in casinos."
Whom to believe? Experience tells me it's never a bad bet in such a noisy debate to give the last word to the person with the lowest level of self-interest.

HEADLINE: Times Goes Forward on Plan for Tower on Eighth Avenue 

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
At a moment when skyscrapers have never seemed more vulnerable, The New York Times Company and Forest City Ratner Companies declared their intention yesterday to build a 52-story tower described by its designers in terms of lightness and transparency.
 "We do not believe that is inconsistent with security at all," said Michael Golden, vice chairman and senior vice president of the Times Company. 
 The final design of the tower was made public at a news conference less than an hour after the Times Company and Forest City Ratner posted letters of credit worth $106 million to guarantee they would meet the cost of acquiring the site, across Eighth Avenue from the Port Authority Bus Terminal. New York State will condemn 10 properties to create the site, which it will lease for 99 years. Mr. Golden would not put a price on the construction project. 
The Times will move its headquarters to the Eighth Avenue tower in 2005 from 229 West 43rd Street, which it will sell. It will own and occupy 800,000 square feet of space in the new building, from the 2nd through 28th floors. Forest City Ratner will own 600,000 square feet and lease floors 29 through 50 to office tenants, asking rents of $75 to $85 a square foot annually.
There are to be restaurants on the 40th and 41st Street sides, stores at the Eighth Avenue corners and a 350-seat auditorium with views of a courtyard filled with birch trees across its stage.
At the summit will be a small grove of maples outside a rooftop conference room, above which a lightweight mast will rise, with no broadcasting or technical function, and will sway in the wind. "It shows where the fresh air comes from," said Renzo Piano, the Italian architect who designed the building with Fox & Fowle. "That is a good enough reason to exist, for me."
Two skins will clad the building: one of transparent glass and another of some 250,000 white ceramic rods, one and five-eighths inches in diameter, arrayed in screens suspended one and a half feet from the exterior wall, spaced at varying intervals to allow people inside to see out -- and the other way around.
"From the outside to the inside, the inside to the outside, there is a permeable feeling," said Mr. Piano, whose works include the exoskeletal Pompidou Center in Paris. "The building talks about movement to the street and the street sees it."
Mr. Piano said Times executives had decided in the wake of the attack on New York to stick with the concept of transparency and visibility "not really as defiance to terrorism but because it was correct."
To the top of the mast, the tower will reach 1,142 feet, almost 100 feet taller than the Chrysler Building. The ceramic screens will reach a height of 840 feet and the building itself will be 748 feet, slightly shorter than Carnegie Hall Tower at 152 West 57th Street.
"It breaks new ground," Gov. George E. Pataki said at the news conference. "This moves the Times Square redevelopment process further to the west" -- exactly the outcome feared by many in the Clinton neighborhood, one of the last low-rise and moderate-income pockets in mid-Manhattan.
Some 55 businesses -- sex shops, trade schools, a student dormitory, architectural and engineering firms and third-generation hatters and fabric dealers -- will be displaced to make way for the tower.
The project will benefit from $26.1 million of government incentives: sales-tax exemptions on the equipment and materials used in the new building, a waiver of the mortgage-recording tax and a discount on electricity rates.
Though the developers will pay acquisition costs up front for the 200-by-400-foot site, they will ultimately be liable for only $85.56 million. The excess will be refunded over time as a credit against the rent they pay for the site, made as a payment in lieu of taxes, meaning that the city is likely to forgo millions in future revenue.
Citing that deal, Gary Barnett of the Intell Management and Investment Company, who owns a parking lot on the development site, filed suit last week against the project. He charged that the "sweetheart arrangement" between the government and the developers amounted to "fraud, bad faith and collusion against the taxpayers of the city" and a waste of taxpayers' money.
A spokeswoman for the Times Company, Catherine J. Mathis, said the lawsuit was without merit.
Lawyers were busy Wednesday as partnership agreements were signed between Forest City Ratner and ING Real Estate, a subsidiary of the ING Group, a financial concern in the Netherlands.

Bruce C. Ratner, president and chief executive of Forest City Ratner, said yesterday, "The hardest part has really been done."

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New York: Manhattan: Costs For Homeless Rise 

BYLINE:  By Nina Bernstein (NYT) (Compiled by Anthony Ramirez) 

 BODY:
 When the city's shelters are full, the city pays hotels to house homeless families with children. Such emergency spending rose sharply, to $40.9 million in the fiscal year that ended June 30, up nearly 43 percent from the year before, the city's Independent Budget Office reported yesterday. 
The office also warned that as the economy weakened, the city's costs for homeless services were likely to grow even more steeply than the increasing number of homeless people. Over all, city costs are anticipated to rise nearly 12 percent, to $531 million next year. The state pays only half of the costs of adult shelters, up to $72 million. The limit was exceeded last year, and is likely to happen again. Nina Bernstein (NYT)

HEADLINE: Japan Bursts Merrill's Balloon 

BYLINE:  ByJAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 13 

 BODY:
Three years ago, Japan's "Big Bang" financial reform fired a starting gun that stampeded Merrill Lynch's thundering herd into Tokyo. Merrill's goal was bold: transform a nation of savers into a nation of investors, and, along the way, make an American brokerage firm a big player in Japan.
 Today, the bulls are tiptoeing out the door, taking career-saving assignments in London or New York or buyouts in time for Christmas in Vail. After losing $600 million in three years, the retail operation faces major surgery. The surgeon, G. Kelly Martin, president of Merrill's International Private Client Group, arrived in Tokyo this week. 
 "We were the only good-news story in 1998 in Japan," John P. Sievwright said wistfully as he prepared to depart on Friday after four years as Merrill's chief executive here. 
The pruning of what Merrill had optimistically called Project Blossom in the spring of 1998 is a tale that revolves partly around American hubris and partly around enduring malaise in Japan, which is stumbling into its fourth recession in a decade.
While Merrill made its fair share of mistakes here, it was stuck trying to make water run uphill. In 20 months, Tokyo's main stock market index has fallen 50 percent. The profits of Japanese brokerage firms have plunged, forcing them into a wave of mergers. Most foreign securities companies are giving up the game of calling the bottom and are closing their retail brokerage outlets.
"If we had seen the stock market going up 5 percent a year for the last three years," said Mr. Sievwright, "we wouldn't be here having this conversation." 
American firms are also cutting back here because Japan's near-term prospects are bleak. After more than half of the major companies on the Tokyo Stock Exchange reported lower profits or bigger losses for the first half, an article in Nihon Kezai predicted that aggregate profits would plunge 74 percent for the year.
For Merrill, the retrenchment represents a second failed bid to win over Japan's investors. An earlier attempt was abandoned in 1993.
"They thought they were going to come sweeping in and bring the gospel," said James C. Abegglen, an American economist who has worked here for half a century and was an adviser to Merrill in the early 1990's. "Well, the heathen didn't want to be converted."
The new venture, he said, was "not sensitive to the local scene."
"They wanted to bring in the University of Florida football coach to run sales training," he added.
Merrill's trademark bull was so little known here that more than once people walked in the door expecting to order a Korean beef barbecue lunch. Since the Japanese are deeply private people, many potential customers felt uncomfortable providing the financial and family details routinely asked by Merrill's brokers.
In 1998, the Big Bang deregulated the financial sector to allow easier foreign investment. But the big pot of gold that lured companies from around the world was half a trillion dollars in time deposits that were due for renewal starting in April 2000. With new deposits offering far lower interest rates, many foreigners calculated that Japanese savers would turn to mutual funds.
Mr. Sievwright, a Scot, said many foreigners arrived here with 1990's good feelings about America's markets. But Japanese investors were more in a 1930's mood.
"Americans had 10 years of good experiences with investing," said Mr. Sievwright, who is taking a buyout from Merrill. "You had morning shows talking about stocks. But if people had constantly put their money into this market and lost money, you would have to be a mad person to say, 'Let's keep doing this.' "
That view was echoed by Brian A. Murdock, regional chairman for Merrill Lynch Investment Managers.
"I don't think the children of the Depression era in the U.S. ever evolved to be aggressive investors," said Mr. Murdock, who is taking a new post with Merrill in London. "In Japan, everything you have learned in the last 15 years of your life says that stocks are not to be trusted."
Last year, savers at the state-run postal savings banks faced the choice of renewing 7 percent deposits at 1 percent or investing in mutual funds. About 80 percent renewed.
"Everyone overestimated the amount of money that would flow out of the postal savings," Mr. Murdock said.
On one level, Merrill's retail retrenchment is part of its wider retrenchment from its 1990's global expansion. In recent weeks, Merrill has sold its Philippines brokerage, and laid off most of its staff in Australia and Singapore. It has found buyers for its operations in South Africa and Canada.
In Japan, where Merrill manages nearly $14 billion, it closed five outlets last summer. Now it is expected to reduce its remaining network of 28 branches to a handful, which will concentrate on its most affluent customers. Merrill had taken over about a quarter of the branches and employees of Yamaichi Securities, once Japan's No. 4 brokerage firm, after it collapsed in scandal.
The firm was closed for six months, giving Merrill time to retrain Yamaichi employees, trying to change them from "churn and burn" brokers to financial advisers.
"We had to get people trained and get everything set up," said Mr. Sievwright, recalling the agony of watching Yamaichi accounts drain away. After reopening, in July 1998, he said, "we were very surprised that the money did not come back."
An economist with another American brokerage firm here recalled watching Japanese rivals take quick advantage of Merrill during the six-month delay, saying: "They immediately lost the corporate accounts to Nikko and Nomura, while people lined up to get their money out. It was like plucking the legs off a dead spider, and Merrill got left with the body."
Although the assets under management have since nearly quadrupled, the hemorrhaging of money at Merrill's retail operation reflects the enduring conservatism of Japanese investors.
With more people over 65 than under 15, "Japan today has the demographics of Florida," Mr. Siev wright said. About 65 percent of Japan's $11.7 trillion in household assets is in older people's hands.
Japanese investors, American brokers say, typically have two pots of money -- one for savings and one for securities, which they see as akin to gambling. Japanese brokerage firms have often had the air of off-track betting parlors, with chain-smoking men watching an electronic ticker board.
One Tokyo resident, Toshiko Suzuki, 56, said she liked to play with small amounts in the stock market, but she said she saw it as gambling.
"My father liked stock transactions," said Mrs. Suzuki, who, like many Japanese housewives, controls family finances, "and he sent me to university with the profits he gained. But in general, people think you lose money in stock transactions."
Japanese markets are seen as far behind American markets on transparency, corporate governance and shareholders' rights.
"Hopefully, we can use Merrill's experience to beat the government over the head for future reforms," said Robert F. Grondine, the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan. "They need to create an S.E.C. to force full disclosure, punish insider trading and manipulators."
Bill Wilder, president of Fidelity Investments Japan, part of FMR, said he was not gloating that Fidelity was enduring here as others retrenched. Keeping overhead low, Fidelity relies on investors using toll-free numbers to reach brokers.
"You want to be out there in a playing field where there are as many competitors as possible," he said. Arguing that Japan's $500 billion mutual fund industry should be 5 to 10 times that size, he added: "The investors would say, 'I want to be part of this pie that is getting bigger and bigger.' "
Despite the blandishments of Merrill and other companies, the portion of the Japanese market owned by individuals has dropped, to about 20 percent today from a third in 1975.
The complaints of Japanese investors usually surround the practice of churning, when brokers buy and sell simply to earn commissions. In the United States last year, only 24 percent of mutual fund portfolios turned over in a year, compared with 64 percent in Japan.
But Japanese stockholders are increasingly knowledgeable about their rights. In the last two years, there has been a doubling, to about 6,000, in the number of investor complaints filed with the Japan Securities Dealers Association.
To educate a new generation of investors, last month five Japanese securities organizations formed a service that will send about 110 former stock analysts out to high schools and colleges to lecture about the basic structure of the stock market and how to invest.

HEADLINE: Aetna Will Cut 6,000 Jobs, About a Sixth of the Work Force 

BYLINE:  By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
Aetna Inc., the troubled health insurance giant, said yesterday that it would eliminate 6,000 jobs, or about one-sixth of its work force, and take a $125 million charge in the fourth quarter as it struggled to regain profitability.
 The job cuts -- including 360 in Hartford, Middletown and Windsor, Conn.; 444 in New Jersey; and 659 in Pennsylvania -- reflect Aetna's dwindling enrollment. It has lost 1.8 million health plan members this year, now at 17.5 million from 19.3 million in January, and it expects to lose more members as it raises rates and eliminates unprofitable Medicare and commercial health maintenance organizations. 
 Dr. John W. Rowe, Aetna's chairman and chief executive, said the cuts were needed to advance the company's turnaround plan, which he said was "emphasizing profitability over size." Health plan membership is expected "to decline materially" in 2002, he said, as Aetna raises prices to cover rising medical costs and as the withdrawals that it has already announced take effect.
As Aetna, based in Hartford, shrinks, it is expected to give up its position as the nation's largest health insurer to the UnitedHealth Group, based in Minnesota, which has 16.5 million members. 
James A. Lane, a health care analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, said the announcement implied that Aetna might lose as many as 2.1 million more members next year, dropping to 15.4 million.
Wall Street analysts expect Aetna to lose $1.65 to $1.93 a share this year, according to Thomson Financial/ First Call. Last month, Aetna reported an operating loss of $49.3 million, or 34 cents a share, in the third quarter as medical costs continued to increase faster than Aetna could pare expenses and raise premiums. The operating loss was $95.9 million, or 67 cents a share, in the second quarter. 
The cuts are "the right decision for the long term," said Lori Price, a health care analyst at J. P. Morgan Chase. But they are not likely to result in "visible signs of recovery" before the second half of next year, she said. 
Aetna has not made a financial forecast for 2002. A spokesman said it would probably make an earnings forecast in February when it reports its fourth-quarter results for 2001. Dr. Rowe has said that he expects the company to match the profitability of the industry leaders by the end of 2003.
Almost half the cuts, 2,700, are customer service workers, which may add to complaints from health plan members, Ms. Price said, despite a pledge by the company yesterday to maintain service levels. Aetna said it was also cutting 1,120 jobs from regional operations, including sales, and 580 jobs in other areas, including information technology and human resources. 
The company said that 4,400 jobs would be eliminated outright and that 1,600 others would be left unfilled as they become vacant. The 6,000 reduction comes on top of the elimination of 5,000 jobs, half through attrition, announced by Aetna last December. 
Todd Richter, an analyst at Banc of America Securities, said most managed care companies had slimmed down, usually through attrition, as the economy has slowed. "But the other companies did it while their business was growing, not while shrinking, like Aetna's business is," he said.
Shares of Aetna fell 30 cents, to $30.74.

HEADLINE: Rebuilding a Day at a Time; 
Law Firm Pushes 2 Steps Forward for Every Step Back

BYLINE:  By JOHN SCHWARTZ 

 BODY:
In the world before Sept. 11, John A. MacKinnon rated a spacious corner office -- not quite big enough for basketball, but enough to consider playing handball. That kind of luxury was not unusual for the partners at Sidley Austin Brown & Wood, a worldwide law firm that occupied most of floors 54 through 59 at 1 World Trade Center.
 His office today is as small and spare as a monk's cell. Gone are the artwork and family pictures, the bound "deal books" containing the papers from each project and the dozens of Lucite "deal cubes" commemorating them, all now part of the rubble being removed from ground zero. 
 Like the other 800 employees of the firm, he has been shoehorned into a building in Midtown Manhattan at 52nd Street and Third Avenue. Mr. MacKinnon says that a friend who knew the building well said: "I hope you got one of the nice corner offices." 
"I'm next door" to one, Mr. MacKinnon replied. The big corner office? Four lawyers work there.
The squeeze is only one of the changes that the people of Sidley Austin have been living with in the months since the terrorist attacks. They have resurrected work that had been scattered to the winds, striving to carry on for clients as if nothing had happened. To a remarkable degree, they have succeeded -- but with their exhilaration and dedication has come a toll in exhaustion and tension.
All the difficulties pale, though, beside the simple fact that all but one of them are still alive. With more than 600 people working at the World Trade Center, the firm lost a single employee, Rosemary Smith, a switchboard operator.
The Monday after the attack, nearly all 800 New York employees met in the ballroom of the Waldorf-Astoria. Thomas R. Smith Jr., the vice chairman of the firm's management committee, opened the meeting with a simple statement: "I'm really glad to see all of you."
The burst of applause caught him by surprise. As the volume rose in a rolling crescendo, Mr. Smith, a steely lawyer and deal maker whose glare might just crack stone, bit his lip. Fighting tears, he, too, began to clap; the people of Sidley Austin rose to their feet, giving a standing ovation to survival itself.
The second-biggest wave of applause went to Charles W. Douglas, chairman of the firm's management committee. He told the crowd that Sidley Austin's insurance policies included tens of millions of dollars worth of coverage for damage to people and facilities, and $1.5 million for the art collection alone. On top of that, the insurance included a provision to recover the losses from interruption of business, even in case of terrorist attack. The policies, he told them, had been renewed on Sept. 1.
Most important, "the assets of the law firm are not the desks in the offices, the woodwork that's on the walls or the paintings that are hung in the corridors," he said. "The assets of the law firm are its people."
Sidley Austin's people say they return day after day to the struggle to rebuild their practice -- for many reasons. Because work itself can be therapeutic. Because that is what they do. And, ultimately, because they think they send a message with every contract and brief.
That's the way Michael L. Fitzgerald sees it. He was in charge of what would have been a garden-variety deal for the firm: a $300 million bond issue for the Mexican broadcaster Televisa. On Sept. 11, Mr. Fitzgerald had been on his way to work to wrap up the project when United Airlines Flight 175 hit some 20 floors above his office; a tire from the plane struck his cab. Shaken, he walked nine miles to his home on East 90th Street.
The next day, Mr. Fitzgerald sat at a conference table with representatives of the other law firms and companies working on the deal; he told them that what they were doing was bigger than an 8 percent senior bond issue due in 2011.
"I said it wasn't just our professional duty but our patriotic duty to get the job done," he recalled. Here, he explained, was a Mexican company coming to Wall Street to raise funds from investors around the world -- a prime example of the global economy at work. "This is something that the terrorists are trying to destroy," he told them. They worked frantically to recreate a foot-high stack of papers that had been drawn up over many weeks.
By the next day, they had pulled it all together: the paper, the lawyers on all sides, the bond underwriters at J. P. Morgan and Salomon Smith Barney, the executives at the bond rating agencies and the company to clear and record the transaction. Some people with offices in the shuttered financial district worked from home. Sidley Austin lawyers got help from colleagues in the firm's branches around the world.
And that afternoon they completed the deal -- on the day it had originally been scheduled to close. "A little bit later in the day than usual," Mr. Fitzgerald allowed.
"We had demonstrated," he added, "that the U.S. capital markets were still open for companies around the world."
That kind of drive astounded Byron Babbish, a senior staff lawyer for Chrysler, which had a deal of its own in the works that Sidley Austin helped to turn around within a week of the attack. He recalled asking Renwick D. Martin, a Sidley lawyer on the deal, whether he really wanted to go forward.
"I whispered to Ren, 'Are you guys up to this?' I didn't want to pressure them. We could probably put this off a day or two. Ren said: 'Let's do it. Anything is better than thinking about what happened.' "
Although the firm has continued to move forward, it has not been easy and the progress has not been steady. Those who returned are still dealing with trauma, and not just their own. Patricia Drake, the office services manager, could not return to work full time for a week because her 4-year-old son, John, could not bear to let her go. The family lives in Brooklyn, and Mrs. Drake's mother, who baby-sits during the day, often pointed across the East River to the World Trade Center towers and said: "Say hi to mommy! She's waving to you." With the towers gone, John asked, "Mommy, will your new building fall?"
Sidley Austin management has hired an outside counseling firm and is trying to be attune to the traumatic after-effects of the attack. "We're not looking for stiff upper lips here," Mr. Smith said.
John Feldkamp, executive director of the New York office, said that at the peak, 18 people found themselves unable to cope with going back to work. The number has dropped by half, he said, but he expects a few to opt eventually for disability payments.
Tensions remain high, and tempers occasionally flare. Dennis O'Donovan, who runs the firm's technical operations, said that when people snap at members of his staff, he tells his employees to "disappear for a half-hour -- take a breather." Still, he said: "It's good to see that our users are back to acting like the New York lawyers that they are. And, of course, I mean that in the nicest possible way."
The effects linger. John Connelly, the director of administration for the firm, spent precious time on Sept. 11 making sure that every Sidley Austin employee left the offices. He carried down emergency supplies with co-workers, getting out just a few minutes before the building collapsed. He is still haunted, he says, by the sight of firemen charging up the stairs as he was on the way down.
"I can go a week or two weeks," he said, "and be absolutely fine."
But on a recent outing with his wife to a street fair in Whippany, N.J., for instance, he saw T-shirts being sold to raise money for firefighters, police officers and emergency medical technicians. The back of the shirt bore this message: "The essence of America are its citizens who are willing to sacrifice their lives as guardians of this nation."
"I just read the T-shirt, and I broke down," he recalled. The shirt hangs in his closet now.
Can any good be wrestled from the horror of Sept. 11? Many at Sidley Austin think so. Sidney Rembert, who walked the floors of Sidley Austin the day of the attack with Mr. Connelly and a cafeteria worker, Kary Wippons, said that their experience had forged deep friendships. He and Mr. Wippons talk at least once a day, and his feelings toward Mr. Connelly -- who he believes saved his life -- are powerful.
"He's not a boss," said Mr. Rembert, 37, sitting in Mr. Connelly's office. "He's like a brother to me."
After getting others out, Mr. Connelly urged Mr. Rembert and Mr. Wippons down the stairs as the fire raged above. When the men reached the ground floor and began to sprint away from the building, they suddenly heard the unearthly roar of the tower's collapse. Still within the range of the falling debris, Mr. Rembert stopped and turned. "I had to see for myself," he said. "I just had to look." 
Mr. Connelly was already many yards ahead. He realized the others had not kept up, and turned. "Let's go!" he shouted. Mr. Rembert snapped out of his trance and ran to safety.
Mr. Connelly and Mr. Rembert treasure a group photo from a Yankees game in 2000. Mrs. Drake is on the far left of the photo, which sat on her desk for more than a year; she intended to make copies for the others. A recovery worker found it at ground zero and recognized a friend in the picture, which made its way back to Mrs. Drake. She has since made the copies.
For his part, Mr. Connelly, 35, has not sought therapy; he talks instead of the excitement he feels during the visits with his wife to the obstetrician to listen to the heartbeat of the child that he and his wife, Donna, are expecting in March. "The baby is therapy now," he said.
As he talked, Mr. Connelly fiddled with a paper clip, bending it slightly and bending it back perfectly into place, again and again. He showed far more concentration in the restoring than the bending.
The process of restoring Sidley Austin continues. The days since Sept. 11 have been filled with an intense hunt for new offices. Last week the firm announced it had finally found a new home, which it will move into next year: 11 floors in the Equitable building at 787 7th Avenue. "We are delighted and relieved and pleased all at once," said Thomas A. Cole, the chairman of the firm's executive committee.
Sidley Austin continues to plan for the future. Nancy L. Karen, chief information officer, said that while she was pleased with how well her network recovered, it could go more smoothly still. "We think we ought to be able to recover in less than a day next time," she said. Then she realized what she had said.
"God forbid!" she added quickly, and laughed nervously.

HEADLINE: Wrapped Tight for the Holidays; 
Shoppers Jam Stores and Form an Emotional Line

BYLINE:  By SHERRI DAY 

 BODY:
 "Stay on your right, you'll always be right," shouted L. E. Jones, the self-proclaimed mouthpiece of the security operation at F. A. O. Schwarz. He was trying to prevent pedestrian gridlock inside the toy store, at Fifth Avenue and 58th Street, where two gargantuan lines of shoppers converged. "Look at this traffic jam," he said. "It's a head-on collision." 
 Long lines, colder weather, shoulder-to-shoulder pedestrian traffic along Fifth Avenue and security guards turned foot-traffic monitors. Despite gloom's best efforts -- the still-healing scars from the terrorist attacks and the financial worries from the recession -- it finally feels like Christmas in New York City. 
And last Saturday in Midtown, the sidewalks and stores overflowed with potential customers, each with a personal philosophy about how to handle shopping in this oh-so-strange holiday after Sept. 11.
Many were determined to spend money. Erwin Baker, a retired publishing executive, calmly perched on a chair outside a dressing room at Bloomingdale's while his wife tried on clothes. 
"We're shopping, and we're keeping our life together," said Mr. Baker, 69, who lives on the Upper East Side. "The holidays just have more meaning."
His wife, Phyllis Fogelman, agreed.
"My office is 10 blocks north of the World Trade Center," she said. "We're not going overboard, but it hasn't stopped us."
Mark Testoni and his wife saved to make sure that their children would have a big Christmas bounty.
"We put a little bit more away than we did last year," said Mr. Testoni, 46, a state trooper from Connecticut. "These knuckleheads didn't stop us. They'll be a little bit more under the tree this year." 
Sophie Ciszewski, a registered nurse from Jersey City, brought her family to Manhattan for their yearly ritual of gazing at window displays. 
"I really haven't altered my Christmas," said Ms. Ciszewski, 42, said as she scoured the glass cases at Tiffany & Company for a silver bracelet. "I love New York. I wouldn't not come. The only bad thing is we can't take the PATH in." 
But there were those in the crowds who were thinking twice about lavish spending. Charles and Kathy Johnson, of Woodhaven, Queens, said they planned to buy most of their gifts from flea markets, vendors' stands and discount stores like Odd-Jobs Stores.
"You get more for your money," said Mr. Johnson, who had just bought several pieces of $5 boxed jewelry from a street vendor. "The prices are too inflated in department stores."
Although DeDe Guthartz and her husband, Matt Guthartz, were doing their last-minute Hanukkah shopping at retail stores, the couple said they were not buying as many gifts as they had in previous years.
"With the economy the way it is you have to be able to find things that don't break the bank, and you still want to find things that make everybody happy," said Mr. Guthartz, 33, a shoe designer.
Mrs. Guthartz said they were also putting more thought into the selection of gifts, instead of simply buying things, and making some presents by hand.
One difference in the stores this year, shoppers said, was that sales clerks were plentiful and seemed more perky and gracious.
At Crate and Barrel, a security guard greeted customers with holiday catalogs, while a line captain directed people to cashiers. An employee at Bloomingdale's invited shoppers to visit Santa Claus on the third floor.
At Tiffany's, employees turned the revolving door for patrons as they stepped inside. Customers noticed the extra effort.
"I think the retailers want you to spend money so they're being a lot nicer than they usually are," said Melissa Kelley, a secretary at American Airlines. "They're not taking anything for granted." 
Carolyn Conner, who owns an insurance agency in Hazlehurst, Ga., and comes to New York during the holidays every year, loved the new attitude.
"It's been wonderful," Mrs. Conner said, as she watched a gift wrapper at Saks Fifth Avenue tying neat bows around her packages. "From sales people on down, they're gracious and appreciative."
One sales clerk offered an explanation. "People are doing more window shopping, and if they're buying they're really looking at the price tag three times," said Kathleen Cecala, who works at Bloomingdale's. "I'm a makeup artist and we stay very busy. Now I have to work for business." She offered an onlooker a facial and free gifts with purchases.
Many of the tourists shopping on Saturday said they came to New York City because they thought it was one way they could help the city in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks. 
Robert and Eve Wall, of Greenville, S.C., came because Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's appeal for tourists impressed them. The couple's first stop after visiting ground zero was Saks.
"The only thing I asked her to do is not to try and save the whole city by herself," Mr. Wall said. 
Mrs. Wall smiled. "But you know," she said, "you only go around once."

Lucent Lowers Sales Forecast; Stocks Hit Hard

BYLINE:  By SIMON ROMERO 

 BODY:
The stocks of Lucent Technologies and other big makers of communications equipment dived yesterday, as reports from Lucent and several other companies indicated that the telecommunications industry's long slump was continuing.
 Lucent, the largest maker of switches and other telecommunications gear, warned that its revenue for the current quarter would shrink by 35 percent, as low as $3.1 billion. 
 Lucent's continued decline is in many ways a result of the company's specific problems. And yet, the broader telecommunications industry has been in recession and Lucent's announcement was accompanied by grim statements yesterday from other companies. 
Qwest Communications, the big Denver-based phone company, said it would cut a further 7,000 jobs and reduce spending on equipment next year to $4.2 billion from an original goal of $5.5 billion. Ciena, a maker of fiber optic equipment and an important Lucent competitor, said revenue would decline by 30 to 40 percent this quarter.
But it was Lucent's warning that shook an industry that had mustered a rally of sorts in the last couple of months. Lucent said it expected a loss this quarter of 23 cents to 26 cents a share, substantially more than the 17 cent loss that had been expected by analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call. 
Lucent's stock fell 15 percent, to $6.52, yesterday, erasing more than a month of modest gains. Ciena's shares fell nearly 17 percent, to $14.94. Qwest was 2 percent lower, at $11.80. Other equipment makers caught in the downdraft included Nortel Networks, Lucent's largest competitor, which lost 11 percent, closing at $7.43. Juniper Networks fell 11 percent, to $21.18. 
Lucent's chief executive, Henry B. Schacht, said in an interview yesterday that his company's forecast, despite its bleakness, was a sign that the worst could be over for Lucent, which has already lost more than $16 billion this year.
"I think we have seen a bottom," Mr. Schacht said. "The best we can tell from our intelligence is that infrastructure spending around the world was very weak this quarter, but we expect our revenue to improve in the coming quarter."
Mr. Schacht declined to provide precise estimates, citing market uncertainties. But he reiterated previous predictions that Lucent would return to profitability in 2002. 
According to Mr. Schacht's earlier estimates, though, Lucent needs at least $4.75 billion in revenue each quarter to break even, which means it would have to increase sales by at least 50 percent from this quarter's level to reach his goal.
"It wouldn't be too herculean a task to grow revenue from this miserable quarter," said Ed Oppedisano, a telecommunications debt analyst at Deutsche Bank, "but meeting their previous goals will be tough. We think they're still burning through a lot of cash despite all the cost-cutting. There is a confluence of negative events that still hangs over Lucent."
The company's problems became evident last year when it disclosed that it could not meet ambitious sales targets. It became apparent that Lucent had offered generous loans to many of the start-ups that bought its products. When the financing for these companies dried up and larger customers grew increasingly cautious, Lucent's bad debts mounted and its sales went into decline. Around the same time, many of the investments it had made in dot-com start-ups went sour. 
Concern over Lucent's liquidity has eased with the recent completion of the sale of its fiber optics business to Furukawa Electric of Japan and CommScope for $2.3 billion. Lucent is thought to have used the proceeds to service debt financing provided by a group of banks earlier this year. Lucent declined to say exactly what it did with the cash.
Still, the unexpected revenue forecast for this quarter has renewed some analysts' concern about Lucent's ability to return to profitability even with a slimmed-down business structure. By the end of the first half of 2002, Lucent expects to have 57,000 to 62,000 employees, down from 150,000 in the middle of 2000. Mr. Schacht said he did not foresee further work force reductions.
It is not yet clear, though, how or when the global telecommunications market will recover, spurring a rise in Lucent's fortunes and those of other equipment makers and carriers. After the bursting of the technology bubble in the last year and a half, the big international phone companies that are Lucent's primary customers remain cautious in spending.
"The turbulence in the market right now points toward further consolidation and rationalization," Graham Wallace, chief executive of Cable and Wireless of Britain, said in an interview yesterday. "As far as we're concerned, our investment in infrastructure has peaked."
Salomon Smith Barney said in a report yesterday that it thought the main reasons for the decline in Lucent's revenue were the loss of market share in crucial products used in land line and wireless networks and in urban fiber optic systems. And Salomon predicted that spending by Lucent's customers would fall by an additional 30 percent in the coming quarter.
"We are not as convinced as Lucent that December should be the low point for sales," Alex Henderson, a Salomon analyst, said in the report. 
Mr. Schacht said the decline in sales was a result more of overall weakness in the market than erosion of market share.
Even as it seeks the comeback path, Lucent is also looking for a successor to Mr. Schacht, who came out of retirement more than a year ago to replace Richard A. McGinn.
One candidate who had been mentioned, Ben Verwaayen, accepted an offer on Wednesday to be chief executive of the BT Group, the renamed British Telecom. Mr. Verwaayen, who joined Lucent in 1997, had led Lucent's sales efforts in Europe and served as its vice chairman.
A Lucent spokeswoman said yesterday that the company was "still in the middle" of its search for Mr. Schacht's successor.

HEADLINE: '02 Forecast For Europe Is Darker 

BYLINE:  ByEDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Dec. 13 

 BODY:
The European Central Bank cut its forecast today for the European economy, predicting that growth in the 12-nation euro zone would be about 1 percent next year.
 The forecast provided more evidence that Europe was falling into a slump that is only slightly less pronounced than that in the United States. 
 It also comes less than three weeks before the arrival of euro notes and coins, which will begin replacing national currencies in 12 countries on Jan. 1. 
The euro changeover appears to be going fairly smoothly, with most banks already finished with the job of stocking up on euros. But consumers are extremely jittery about possible price increases, and overall consumer confidence has dropped sharply.
The European Central Bank said that growth in the 12-nation euro zone was likely to range from 0.7 percent to 1.7 percent next year and that the current stagnation was likely to persist at least several more months.
But the central bank also said that inflation was likely to drop well below 2 percent, which many economists say will allow the bank to reduce interest rates.
Jose Luis Alzola, an economist in London at Schroder Salomon Smith Barney, said the forecast was roughly in line with forecasts by private banks.
The central bank's most surprising prediction, he said, was that the euro zone's economy would expand only 2.5 percent in 2003. That would be no more than the long-term average growth rate in Europe, despite the fact that growth is usually faster than normal as an economy bounces back from a slump or a recession.
Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, provided its own bleak assessment today. Germany, which accounts for a third of the euro zone's economic output, is already technically in a recession, and many economists predict it will grow less than 1 percent next year.
"What we are missing the most right now is confidence and trust," said Ernst Welteke, the Bundesbank's president. German growth has been hurt by a slumping global demand for its exports, and domestic demand is too weak to pick up the slack, he said.
The only good news in today's assessments was the strong expectation that inflation would continue to decline. European inflation peaked at 3.4 percent in May, mostly because of rising oil and food prices, but it has now declined to about 2.4 percent.
"The message that I would draw from that is that we will are still going to see more rate cuts," said Mr. Alzola of Schroder Salomon Smith Barney.
Unemployment is rising again in Europe, with companies in manufacturing, telecommunications and technology reducing their work forces by thousands of people.
That poses big political problems for Germany's chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, who will face national elections next fall and who made unemployment the main issue in his political campaign last year.
But the bigger problem is that European budget deficits are rising sharply, and some countries are in danger of bumping against the limits set by the Stability and Growth Pact that governs all countries that adopted the euro.
Germany, which had pushed the hardest for rules limiting deficits to 3 percent of a country's gross domestic product, will see its own deficit more than double next year to 2.5 percent.
Though European leaders insist they still plan to adhere to goals for achieving balanced budgets the next several years, most private economists are extremely skeptical that they will succeed, given the growing pressure for fiscal stimulus to revive economic growth.

HEADLINE: A Boost for the Economy 

 BODY:
President Bush and Congressional leaders are finally getting serious about negotiating an agreement to stimulate the economy and provide help for those hit hardest by the recession. With only a few days left to reach an accord, Republicans have, little by little, acceded to Democratic demands to extend jobless payments and provide health benefits to those thrown out of work. The Democrats in turn have agreed to expand tax breaks for business. But the talks remain snagged on a few areas, the biggest of which is the Republicans' misguided insistence on income tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. Dropping that demand could help produce a quick and welcome agreement. 
 In striving to reach a compromise, Republicans and Democrats need to remember a few key principles. The first is that the package, estimated to cost $100 billion in the next year, should not permanently widen the federal deficit. It should concentrate its benefits on the most needy Americans. It should provide a quick and real stimulus to the economy. Finally, and most important for New York, it should not only hold states harmless against tax code changes that reduce state tax revenues, it should provide financial relief to the states. 
 Unfortunately, the Republican strategy since Sept. 11 has been to lard the stimulus bill with unnecessary tax benefits to those least in need of help. Republicans are now trying to win over a handful of conservative Democrats who voted for Mr. Bush's tax cut earlier in the year. The administration should instead work for a package that wins broad bipartisan support.
Republicans do seem willing to drop their insistence on eliminating the corporate minimum tax, a step that would have awarded huge tax breaks to the nation's biggest businesses. But the G.O.P. still insists on accelerating the individual income tax cuts enacted earlier this year. That mostly helps families making $150,000 or more. It also widens the deficit, and is intended to lock in tax cuts for the rich. 
Though the Republicans have agreed to expand health benefits for the unemployed, their proposals favor young and healthy people at the expense of older and ill Americans. The health benefits plan needs to be restructured. Equally important, the tax breaks for expenses and depreciation, now endorsed by Democrats as well as Republicans, would cost the states $5 billion in lost revenue, because their taxes are based on federal law. The bill needs both to make up for that lost revenue and help New York and other states cope with their budget deficits. Otherwise, Congress would end up trying to stimulate the economy while forcing states to cut aid to schools, health care and social services. 
Congress members love to talk about their respect for state governments. They should back up their talk with money and include state aid, as George Pataki of New York and other governors are asking.

HEADLINE: Eleven And Counting 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Embarrassing but true: Just one month ago the James A. Baker III Institute presented Alan Greenspan with its Enron Prize. I'm not suggesting any impropriety; it was just another indication of how deeply the failed energy company was enmeshed with our ruling elite.
 And yet Mr. Greenspan also finds himself in Chapter 11. That is, the Fed has now cut interest rates 11 times this year, and has yet to see any results. What's going on? 
 One answer is that something has gone wrong with the monetary "transmission mechanism," the drive train that normally links the Fed's actions with the real economy. And one of the people who stripped the Fed's gears is Mr. Greenspan himself. 
The Fed's direct power over the economy is actually more limited than is widely appreciated. People often say that the Fed controls interest rates, but what it actually controls is only an interest rate, the rate in the overnight federal funds market. And this interest rate is, in itself, of very little economic importance. 
Normally, however, a fall in the federal funds rate indirectly affects financial variables that do matter; it leads to higher stock prices, a weaker dollar and -- above all -- lower long-term interest rates. Goldman Sachs economists have incorporated these variables into a "financial conditions index" that, they show, has historically done a very good job of predicting future economic performance. 
Based on past experience, you would have expected the Fed's dramatic rate cuts since January to lower the Goldman Sachs index by about five points -- enough to produce a roaring 2002. In fact, however, the index has fallen only about half a point, largely because long-term interest rates have not fallen at all. The Fed, in other words, is getting almost no bang for its bucks. Why?
Part of the explanation is self-defeating optimism. Bond traders continue to believe, despite mounting evidence to the contrary, that Mr. Greenspan is a magician -- that he will soon conjure up another dramatic boom, and will then raise interest rates to cool a red-hot economy. Ironically, this very belief helps keep long-term rates high, and thus ensures that no such boom seems imminent. 
And then there's the federal budget. Just months ago we were dazzled with projections of huge federal surpluses; there was enough money, the Bush administration insisted, to have a big tax cut, increase spending and still pay off the federal debt. But on Tuesday Paul O'Neill quietly asked Congress to raise the federal government's debt ceiling -- something he had previously said would not be necessary until 2008 at the earliest. 
Has the sudden return of federal deficits had an impact on long-term interest rates? Of course it has. Just a few months ago everyone expected the federal government to pay off its debt, drastically reducing the supply of bonds; now it turns out that it will actually be borrowing money. Inevitably this depresses bond prices, which is the same as raising long-term interest rates. So the rapid deterioration of federal finances is part of Mr. Greenspan's problem. (Has the negative impact of the tax cut on the economy via its effect on interest rates outweighed the positive effect on consumer spending? Yes, on any reasonable calculation.)
Mr. Greenspan, then, finds himself with much less ability to move the economy than anyone expected. And it's partly his own fault. After all, he did much to cultivate the mystique that now turns out to be a handicap. And let's not forget that he intervened decisively on behalf of large tax cuts back in January, when he urged Congress to prevent what he then saw as a great risk: that surpluses would be too large, and that the federal debt would be paid off too quickly.
It might be helpful if Mr. Greenspan would now say something to dampen self-defeating belief in a sudden economic turnaround. It would be even more helpful if he would concede, however indirectly, that he gave Congress bad advice last January; that might prepare the ground for an eventual return to fiscal responsibility. But the Fed chairman, who was quite willing to intervene in fiscal politics when that was helpful to the Bush administration, has gone oddly silent on the subject now that those surplus projections turn out to have been bad science fiction.
Maybe Mr. Greenspan deserved that Enron Prize after all.

HEADLINE: From Bush, 'Formal Notice' of End of Pact 

 BODY:
Following is an excerpt from the text of President Bush's remarks in the White House Rose Garden yesterday announcing that the United States would withdraw from the Antiballistic Missile Treaty, as provided by the White House:
 I've just concluded a meeting of my National Security Council. We reviewed what I discussed with my friend President Vladimir Putin over the course of many meetings, many months. And that is the need for America to move beyond the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty. 
 Today, I have given formal notice to Russia, in accordance with the treaty, that the United States of America is withdrawing from this almost 30-year-old treaty. I have concluded the ABM treaty hinders our government's ability to develop ways to protect our people from future terrorist or rogue-state missile attacks. 
The 1972 ABM treaty was signed by the United States and the Soviet Union at a much different time, in a vastly different world. One of the signatories, the Soviet Union, no longer exists. And neither does the hostility that once led both our countries to keep thousands of nuclear weapons on hair-trigger alert, pointed at each other. The grim theory was that neither side would launch a nuclear attack because it knew the other would respond, thereby destroying both.
Today, as the events of Sept. 11 made all too clear, the greatest threats to both our countries come not from each other, or other big powers in the world, but from terrorists who strike without warning, or rogue states who seek weapons of mass destruction.
We know that the terrorists, and some of those who support them, seek the ability to deliver death and destruction to our doorstep via missile. And we must have the freedom and the flexibility to develop effective defenses against those attacks. Defending the American people is my highest priority as commander in chief, and I cannot and will not allow the United States to remain in a treaty that prevents us from developing effective defenses.
At the same time, the United States and Russia have developed a new, much more hopeful and constructive relationship. We are moving to replace mutually assured destruction with mutual cooperation. Beginning in Ljubljana, and continuing in meetings in Genoa, Shanghai, Washington and Crawford, President Putin and I developed common ground for a new strategic relationship. Russia is in the midst of a transition to free markets and democracy. We are committed to forging strong economic ties between Russia and the United States, and new bonds between Russia and our partners in NATO. NATO has made clear its desire to identify and pursue opportunities for joint action at 20.
I look forward to visiting Moscow, to continue our discussions, as we seek a formal way to express a new strategic relationship that will last long beyond our individual administrations, providing a foundation for peace for the years to come.
We're already working closely together as the world rallies in the war against terrorism. I appreciate so much President Putin's important advice and cooperation as we fight to dismantle the Al Qaeda network in Afghanistan. I appreciate his commitment to reduce Russia's offensive nuclear weapons. I reiterate our pledge to reduce our own nuclear arsenal between 1,700 and 2,200 operationally deployed strategic nuclear weapons. President Putin and I have also agreed that my decision to withdraw from the treaty will not, in any way, undermine our new relationship or Russian security. As President Putin said in Crawford, we are on the path to a fundamentally different relationship. The cold war is long gone. Today we leave behind one of its last vestiges.

Oracle Hits Profit Goal, but Sales Are Far Off Estimates

BYLINE:  By CHRIS GAITHER 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 13 

 BODY:
The Oracle Corporation reported quarterly earnings today that matched Wall Street's expectations despite a sharp decline in its sales, especially in its software that runs enormous computer databases.
 Calling the quarter its toughest in a decade, Oracle said it never fully recovered from the Sept. 11 attacks, which happened two weeks into the company's second fiscal quarter. 
 The company, the world's second-largest software maker, said the terrorist attacks and the faltering economy caused sales for the quarter, which ended Nov. 30, to decline 11 percent from the comparable period last year.
Overall sales of software licenses, a crucial benchmark of the company's health, fell 27 percent, a much steeper decline than anticipated. Eighty percent of Oracle's license sales come from its database business. Oracle, based in Redwood Shores, Calif., said it did not expect business to grow rapidly again until the worldwide market recovers. 
"While we have lots of competitive challenges, it's more that we are all prisoners of the economy right now," Jeff Henley, the chief financial officer, said in an interview. But in a conference call with analysts, Mr. Henley said he expected a slight improvement in the coming months. For the current quarter, he predicted flat earnings and new license sales that would decline less sharply than during the last quarter. In the fourth quarter, he said, earnings should improve 2 or 3 cents a share from the year-earlier quarter, when Oracle reported a profit of 15 cents a share.
Oracle, more than competitors like I.B.M. and Microsoft, relied on booming business from dot-coms, which accounted for 15 percent of its North American sales last year. This year, Oracle is struggling to make up for the demise of those businesses.
For the second quarter, Oracle reported earnings of $549 million, or 10 cents a share, compared with $623 million, or 11 cents a share, during the second quarter last year, meeting estimates by the research firm Thomson Financial/First Call. Oracle's revenue declined 11 percent, to $2.36 billion from $2.66 billion. Analysts expected $2.5 billion.
Software licenses fell to $803 million, from $1.1 billion during the comparable period last year. The 27 percent plunge exceeded the warning from Lawrence J. Ellison, chief executive of Oracle, who said shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks that licenses could decline as much as 15 percent.
Oracle's core business, the database market, declined to $1.11 billion, from $1.25 billion in the period last year. In an interview, Mr. Henley conceded that Oracle might have taken its domination in the market for granted, but said customers had expressed satisfaction with its newest database software application, the 9i.
Mr. Ellison said many investors had asked him whether I.B.M. and Microsoft had taken market share from Oracle. "It's a resounding no," he said, adding that he thought the opposite was true.
James A. Moore, a managing director with Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown, said Oracle seemed to be holding its own against its competitors as the market slowed. His team of analysts recently surveyed Oracle customers and found that most were pleased with the 9i database. But while he praised the company for cutting costs to bolster profits, he warned that he saw little growth potential until budgets for information technology loosen.
Oracle is "basically a proxy for the health of I.T. spending," he said.
But Betsy Burton, an analyst with Gartner, a market research firm, said Oracle faces deeper challenges. She said major companies had told her that they refuse to let Oracle sales representatives in the door because of displeasure with their pricing and negotiating tactics. And Oracle has suffered some high-profile defections of top executives, including the recent resignation of a vice president, Jay Nussbaum.
Ms. Burton said Oracle had recently improved its pricing methods, but still had work to do to improve its credibility with customers.
"I don't purely see Oracle as a victim of the economy," Ms. Burton said. "They have their own housecleaning that they have to deal with."
The company reported its results after regular trading hours. In regular trading, Oracle fell 43 cents, or 3 percent, to $14.67. It fell as low as $14.30 in after-hours trading.

Executions declined across the country for the second year in a row, to 66 from 85 in 2000 and 98 in 1999. The decline is partly attributable to the ebb and flow of the appeals process, but it also comes in a year in which many states have re-examined the fairness of capital punishment. A24

HEADLINE: Beliefs; 
Tithing in a time of extra need. For a Manhattan couple, a 10th is a good round number.

BYLINE:  By Peter Steinfels

 BODY:
Among some devout religious believers, tithing -- giving 10 percent of one's income to charity -- is a duty commanded by God and strictly observed. But meet a Manhattan couple who do not tithe primarily out of religious obligation. They do it out of efficiency. 
 It is true that they chose that standard because they know that tithing is a practice rooted in the Bible. And they know that tithing has its parallels in other religious traditions, as well; in the zakat, for instance, the religious tax that is one of the five pillars of Islam, and in the alms-giving practices of Buddhism and Hinduism. 
 But for this couple, 10 percent is no more sacred a target than 9 or 11 percent, or 5 or 15 percent. Their point is simply that it is a venerable, reasonable target, and hewing to it gets the job done. 
Estimates of charitable giving vary depending on what methods are used, but the latest survey by the Independent Sector, a coalition of nonprofit and philanthropic organizations, reports that 89 percent of American households contributed to charity last year, giving an average of 3.2 percent of their income. Include the households that did not give at all, and the average drops to 2.6 percent. 
It is not surprising that the couple in question are unwilling to be named. Matters of personal finance are far more private these days than sex lives, it seems, especially for professional people like these, with careers (and modest reputations) in publishing, teaching, freelance writing, consulting and occasional public relations work. Ordinarily they would be deathly embarrassed to reveal anything about their tithing. They worry that appearing to boast of it could seriously complicate their work lives. 
Only the impression that this is a time of expanded need and a tightening economy, a time of unemployed shopkeepers in Lower Manhattan and children at death's door in Afghanistan, has loosened their tongues, in hopes of encouraging people to think about their giving habits. 
Both of them work. Their income varies from year to year; usually it is over $150,000 and under $200,000. They could probably earn more but have a weakness for jobs with various not-for-profit organizations. Their mortgage is paid off. Their children are through college. 
For years, they gave to charity on an ad hoc basis. They contributed regularly to their religious congregation. They responded to appeals after natural disasters. They supported several cultural activities with small sums and gave to human rights organizations and groups fighting hunger overseas. They wrote modest checks to help the disabled and those suffering from AIDS. 
But they never knew the total of each year's giving until income tax time. 
"And then I was usually embarrassed," the husband said. " 'Oh, we'll give more this year' -- that was my good intention -- but it always turned out to be pretty much the same."
"Naturally, I didn't think of us as rich," he continued, "but I was aware that from the perspective of the world's population or of all of human history, we were among the richest sliver of a fraction of people who ever lived.
"And then I knew the shocking data that shows that poor people are actually more generous in giving than the well-off," he said. 
A 1999 study by the Independent Sector did in fact suggest that low-income households tended to be significantly more generous than those wealthier, but other analysts disagree, contending that the organization's methodology misses large contributions from those in higher-income brackets.
The Manhattan couple have not stopped giving regularly to their congregation and writing checks to other charities as the spirit moves them. But about this time each year, they sit down, add up all these contributions and figure out how far short they have come to giving away 10 percent of their income. Usually it is at least several thousand dollars.
A few weeks ago, they began filling a manila folder with the appeals that flood the mail at this time of the year. Sometime in the next two weeks they will sit down again, pick and choose among those appeals and write checks until their tithing is done. 
"It's not terribly thoughtful," the husband admitted. "I have some ideas about which charities use their resources most effectively, and of course we have some causes that are closer to our hearts than others. But in the end a lot of this is guesswork." 
In the end, however, the checks do get written and the target sum is reached. The spouses share a discomfort with getting on anyone's list of big donors, so it's only $100 here, $200 there, maybe one or two $500 contributions. It adds up quickly, and if the couple need to delve a bit into their savings, they will do so, just as they would for any unavoidable financial obligation. 
The husband plays down the religious significance of this method. In fact, he suspects it could be spiritually deleterious. 
"At least I'm not using our tithing as a salve for, say, cutting corners ethically in my work," he said, "but I do worry about making it a substitute for more personal acts of helping." Self-described workaholics, the couple believe they give far too little of their time to hands-on service to those in need. 
"Tithing does not excuse this," the husband said. "I know that, but I still wonder whether at some level I take just enough satisfaction in our giving to let me off the hook." 
The process may be mechanical but it is also efficient. 
"I can't promise anybody that they'll be better because they do this," the husband said. "I doubt that I'm really a better person myself since we started. But becoming a better person is a lifetime job. Meanwhile, some people in need will have food in their bellies or medical aid at hand or counseling or an advocate to help them through their troubles. That should count for something."

HEADLINE: November Industrial Output Was Off but Beat Estimates 

BYLINE:  Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 14 

 BODY:
Industrial production dropped for the fourth consecutive month in November, the Federal Reserve said today, down 0.3 percent after a 0.9 percent October plunge.
 Analysts had expected a 0.7 percent decline. Industrial production has fallen 6.8 percent since its June 2000 peak -- the biggest decline since the 1981-82 recession. 
 The current recession's grip, meanwhile, kept consumer price inflation in check during November.
The Labor Department said today that falling food and energy costs kept the Consumer Price Index flat last month after a decline of 0.3 percent in October. Analysts had expected a 0.1 percent decline. Imported energy is cheaper primarily because the global economic slowdown has reduced demand.
Despite their overall grim tone, the reports from the government contained hints of the potential for recovery ahead. Analysts said that meant aggressive interest rate cuts by the Fed were probably near or at an end.
But costs for medical care and shelter as well as for 2002-model cars and tobacco all climbed, helping drive the core rate of inflation -- which excludes food and energy -- up 0.4 percent.
That was twice the 0.2 percent rise posted in October and the sharpest gain for any month since a matching 0.4 percent rise in January 1996.
Businesses ran at their slowest rate in 18 1/2 years, using only 74.7 percent of maximum operating capacity.
The automotive sector proved a bright spot, however, because auto production was ramped up to match sales driven by no-interest loans from automakers.
The Fed said vehicle assemblies rose to an 11.81 million annual rate from 10.70 million in October, the strongest clip since July.
A third report, from the Commerce Department, showed businesses were making solid progress at the start of the fourth quarter in paring down overstocked inventories -- a necessary condition before industrial output can reaccelerate.
Inventories dropped 1.4 percent in October, the biggest plunge since records were first kept in their current form in 1992, after a revised 0.6 percent decline in September. Overall business sales climbed a record 2.7 percent, with retailers posting strong gains on booming new-car sales.
"All of these reports can be taken as tentative signs that recession is at least slowing," said Robert Dederick, economic consultant to the Northern Trust Company in Chicago. "These data also suggest that the need for, and desirability of, further monetary easing may be coming to an end."
Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors Inc. in Holland, Pa., said the C.P.I. report constituted a red flag for markets and for policy makers. Medical and other service costs will probably keep rising once the economic turnaround occurs, he added.
"Thus, while inflation remains tame for now, any indication that the economy is moving into an above-trend growth mode will almost certainly be met by aggressive Fed tightening," he said.

HEADLINE: Joblessness Is Fraying Istanbul's Social Fabric 

BYLINE:  By SOMINI SENGUPTA 

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, Dec. 14 

 BODY:
Hands stuffed into empty pockets, Ali Adiguzel stood in the cold dusk, waiting for the muezzin's call and a free meal. 
 Like tens of thousands of urban Turks, he is unemployed. Mr. Adiguzel, a 32-year-old Ankara man, arrived here a month ago in search of work. Today he had come, along with about 2,000 other people, to a large tent in the city's main square, Taksim, to break his Ramadan fast. Private donations, customary during the holy month, paid for this evening's supper: soup, rice, vegetables, a four-inch hunk of bread. 
 "I don't feel happy about being here now," Mr. Adiguzel said. "I'm a young man. I'm healthy. I'm strong. I should be able to work." 
Every year during the Muslim holy month, which ends here on Sunday, the rich feed the poor at public tents like this one. But lines are twice as long at this tent this year, organizers say, echoing similar reports from other tents handing out the free meals. Demand for food packages has also risen.
The economic crisis that began in February has altered the social fabric of this city in many ways. Gasoline has become so unaffordable for many that traffic is noticeably lighter. Window bars have gone up to stave off thieves. A new brand of drive-by purse snatchings has shaken residents' sense of safety. 
Turkey, one of the United States' strongest allies in the Islamic world, is in the throes of what is widely regarded as the worst economic crisis in its modern history.
There is little confidence in the coalition government. Islamist political parties currently banned by the ruling elite in their striving to preserve modern Turkey's secular state are still important players because of the support they have traditionally enjoyed from the urban poor, whose ranks are now swelling.
Today, the International Monetary Fund announced that it had reached what it called an agreement in principle on a $10 billion package for Turkey, if the government carried out certain reforms. The new package would come on top of an existing $19 billion bailout from the fund.
On Wednesday, the Turkish Parliament passed a budget with tight spending limits designed to comply in advance with the fund's demands.
In some quarters, the I.M.F. aid is seen as a reward for support of the American-led war in Afghanistan. (Turkey was the first Muslim-majority nation to offer troops.)
"Sept. 11 was a blessing for Turkey," said Mensur Akgun, an international relations professor at Kultur University in Istanbul. "We were luckier than Argentina," he added, referring to that nation's efforts to stave off default on its much larger debt, and the fund's refusal so far to extend extra loans.
Others are less cynical, noting that Turkey, which fought armed insurgents of the Kurdish minority for 15 years until a cease-fire in 1999, has its own reasons to join the fight against terrorism.
"Of course we wanted support in the I.M.F. or wherever," said Cem Duna, a former diplomat who is now an investment consultant. "But our own efforts to combat terrorism were no less an element than anything else." 
For their part, I.M.F. officials have said the loan package had nothing to do with Turkey's new geopolitical role. 
Word of the I.M.F. loan has lifted the Turkish lira for the first time in months. Over the past year, the currency has lost approximately half its value against the dollar, and today stood at about 1,470,000 to the dollar. Inflation is in the high double digits, the economy is expected to shrink 8.5 percent this year, and per-capita annual income hovers around $2,200, the lowest since 1994.
The general aversion to air travel since the Sept. 11 attacks only sharpened the economic crunch by hitting tourism, one of few sectors that was still relatively flourishing.
In the working-class Istanbul district of Zeytinburnu the other day, Nevin Yakupoglu snaked through the narrow rain-soaked streets, trolling for the neediest of families.
As a volunteer with the municipal government's Ramadan charity program, Ms. Yakupoglu had in the trunk of her car sealed cardboard boxes of Ramadan aid: cans of tomato sauce, rice, a jar of marmalade, a big tin of olive oil.
In Hatice Cil's home, a two-room shanty built illegally years ago, Ms. Yakupoglu heard a familiar story. Mrs. Cil, 27, said her husband sold grilled liver on the street. Nowadays, business is so meager that the couple and their two small children barely survive. The landlord is owed a year's rent. They were behind on their bills. Yes, she said, they were all eating. But fruit was a luxury, and only for the children.
This year, what has surprised Ms. Yakupoglu most, she said, are the reluctant calls for help from ordinary working families -- people with jobs, education and ambition, unaccustomed to seeking charity. "It's a frightening thing to see," Ms. Yakupoglu said. 
Zeki Mergen, 27, a father of three who was standing in line at the tent in Taksim Square, waited with his TV-dinner tray in hand. He has a job, but the 250 million liras he earns each month as a construction worker -- roughly $180 -- is not nearly enough to cover basic expenses. "Each day is getting worse," Mr. Mergen said. "We miss yesterday."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS; 
Shares Advance to End Week of Uneasiness for Investors

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks eked out gains after a late afternoon bounce yesterday, capping a week of losses amid increasing investor unease about the slipping economy and unrelenting bad news on corporate profits.
 "We've had a bit of profit taking after a pretty good couple of weeks, and the consensus had become that there would be a correction," said John Manley, chief equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney. "But now there's more upside to the market after all the selling." 
 Recent data have failed to offer a concrete picture of how and when the economy will emerge from recession. The market has also been buffeted by a steady procession of companies warning that their earnings have been deeply eroded by the economic slump, including blue-chip companies like Merck and American Express. 
"People are counting on a recovery very soon," said James Park, senior vice president of the brokerage firm of Brean Murray & Company. "Guidance and earnings are just telling you that it will take a little more time, but it's going to be a tough market."
The fourth-quarter confessional season -- when companies warn that results may miss forecasts -- heats up at the end of December. Analysts predict that profits for the Standard & Poor's 500 companies will sink by almost 19 percent, according to the research firm Thomson Financial/ First Call. That forecast could drop further as analysts cut their outlooks throughout the quarter.
After spending much of the session hovering near unchanged levels from Thursday's close, the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average climbed 44.70 points, or 0.5 percent, to 9,811.15. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 3.69 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,123.07. The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index advanced 6.66 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,953.17.
For the week, the Dow fell 2.4 percent, while the S.& P. 500 dropped 3 percent and the Nasdaq slid 3.4 percent.
The possibility that the war in Afghanistan could be drawing to a close gave traders reason to buy, analysts said. 
McDonald's helped support the blue-chip Dow and ignited a rally in restaurant shares by predicting growth next year, even as it said fourth-quarter U.S. sales would fall slightly. McDonald's climbed $1.16, to $26.80.
Amgen, the world's largest biotechnology company, fell $4.16, to $56.03, as investors seemingly gave a "thumbs down" to reports of a plan to buy the Immunex Corporation, an arthritis drug maker. Immunex lost $1.34, to $25.62.
Cisco Systems Inc. led technology issues higher and was the most actively traded stock on the Nasdaq. Shares of Cisco rose 38 cents, or 2 percent, to $19.39.
The software giant Oracle posted an earnings drop late Thursday, which helped curb gains in technology. Oracle shed 10 cents, to $14.57.
The company, the software vendor, posted earnings that were down from a year ago and called the last quarter "our toughest quarter in a decade." But Oracle said it expected profit growth to resume by the second quarter of next year.
Treasury bond prices fell yesterday after hints the economy might soon emerge from recession, with data showing a record drop in business inventories in October, while industrial production in November declined less than forecast.
The 10-year Treasury note fell 24/32 , to a price of 98 22/32 . The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.17 percent from 5.07 percent on Thursday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 31/32, to 97 2/32 . The bond's yield rose to 5.58 percent from 5.51 percent on Thursday.

HEADLINE: Washington Talk; 
Congress Starts Looking for Plan to End Session

BYLINE:  By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 14 

 BODY:
The senators' cars were marshaled outside the Capitol on Thursday evening, looking like an officers' motor pool or perhaps the start of the Beltway 500. Senators had just finished saying how urgent it was to pass a farm bill or an insurance guarantee measure. Now it was time to take the last four-day weekend of the legislative year.
 The House had adjourned earlier and will return later on Tuesday than the Senate. 
 Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the majority leader, was asked whether he had a deadline for the end of this session of Congress, and the closest he would come to a commitment was, "Christmas Day, maybe." But to keep a quorum of senators in town past sundown on Friday, Dec. 21, would require the kind of magical powers that could be used instead to pass all the legislation that he wants.
The farm bill is the current business before the Senate. But Republicans have been stalling it. Democrats argue that it needs to be passed this year before a shaky economy overcomes the urge to spend billions on subsidies. For the same reason, the Bush administration would rather wait. This is one bill that could actually move faster after the four days off. Democrats hope farm state Republican senators will be pressured at home and vote to end the filibuster.
The only bill most of the public would consider urgent is the economic stimulus measure. Meetings, though not necessarily negotiations, will be held all weekend, with both sides continually weighing whether it is better to give in on an important issue or try to sell the public on the idea that it was the other guy's fault that nothing happened. 
House Republicans have already announced a plan to make Democrats look bad. If there is no deal, they will ram through a bill that has the backing of a few Senate Democrats and contend that they behaved in a bipartisan fashion, even though they know that it will not become law.
The insurance bill is an issue that almost everyone on Capitol Hill concedes is urgent. About 70 percent of business insurance policies expire on Dec. 31, and many insurers are refusing to provide coverage for future terrorist attacks. Banks and other lenders say they will not lend money for real estate or manufacturers without adequate insurance coverage. A credit crunch crippling a struggling economy is a serious forecast.
The stumbling block is Republican insistence that if insurers are to be protected, taxpayers should be, too, by limitations on lawyers' fees and liability payments. The insurance industry asked for no such provision, and most Democrats and trial lawyers regard it as an intolerable interference with the rights of plaintiffs. The House passed a bill with such provisions. But in the Senate, a filibuster would be guaranteed, unless Republicans promise not to raise the issue.
Three major appropriations bills remain to be voted on. The one that would cover the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services and Education is pretty well wrapped up. The bill to cover foreign aid has one hurdle remaining, how to deal with family planning activities abroad. The military appropriations bill has a major fight over how much of a $20 billion add-on should go for the Pentagon, because the House and the administration want more than the Senate does.
Probably the only other must-pass legislation is a bill dealing with removing tax liabilities for this year and last year for victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and providing some tax relief for businesses in Lower Manhattan.
Mr. Daschle talked bravely today of merely recessing the Senate, subject to the call of the chair, and calling it back to work in mid-January to finish up things left undone this year. But January vacations have already been planned.
He may have better luck relying on history. Sometimes a remarkable amount of legislation -- some of it remarkable for its eventually discovered contents -- is passed in the last few days of a session. If a problem is really crucial, sometimes lawmakers drop their objections or look for a compromise.

HEADLINE: Fannie Mae Sets Mortgage Record 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 14 

 BODY:
Fannie Mae, the nation's leading buyer of home loans, said it had committed itself to buying a record $49 billion in mortgage loans in November as homeowners flocked to refinance and take out new loans. 
 The figure surpassed the previous high of $33.6 billion, which Fannie Mae agreed to buy in October. 
It bought $25 billion in loans last month. Its portfolio of loans and bonds grew by $3 billion, to $696 billion, for a 4.8 percent annualized growth rate, the slowest this year as refinancing spurred the liquidation of $21 billion in loans. 
 Fannie Mae is benefiting from a lending boom that has taken place as the Federal Reserve repeatedly cut interest rates this year and the 30-year mortgage rate slipped to a record low of 6.45 percent during the week of Nov. 9. Some analysts expect lending to top $2 trillion this year, beating 1998's record of $ l.5 trillion. 
"The mortgage purchase volume is going to stay high a couple of months after refinancing slows down," said Makiko Coakley, an analyst at Lehman Brothers. 
The lending boom has created a backlog of mortgage applications and the industry is "pushing the big volume into next year," said Mr. Coakley.
"I'm trying to get a mortgage myself," he said, "and it's really, really slow."
Earlier this week, the Fed cut its overnight lending rate between banks for the 11th time this year, to a 40-year low of 1.75 percent.

HEADLINE: Delivering Hope By Another Route; 
H.I.V. Activists Collect Drugs For the Needy Outside the U.S.

BYLINE:  By JENNY HOLLAND

 BODY:
It started when a stranger asked for help. 
 A woman walked into Jesus Aguais's office at St. Vincent's Manhattan Hospital in the fall of 1996. She had traveled from Venezuela because her son and daughter-in-law had tested positive for H.I.V., she said, and she had sold everything, including her burial plot, to come to the United States for medicine. The drugs they needed for survival cost $1,000 per month. 
 Her story gave him an idea. Mr. Aguais, an AIDS educator at St. Vincent's and an H.I.V. activist, had been collecting surplus medication from friends and storing it, but until then, he said, he was unsure what to do with it. 
"Who makes $1,000 a month in South America?" he asked in an interview. "I had to get organized."
He started Aid for AIDS, which collects donated medication from across the United States and Canada, from various sources, including from people with H.I.V. who change prescriptions, stop taking a certain medication, or die. The drugs are inspected and then sent overseas to needy people with H.I.V. who would not otherwise have access to medications.
The medicine collected by Aid for AIDS comes from patients, social workers and doctors. The organization says it is now helping to keep alive 300 people from Ecuador to Ethiopia, through its shipments and efforts to find local health care. 
Aid for AIDS is small -- just three employees -- and most of its money comes from private donors. (It is a federally registered charitable group.) The group, whose office is on Greenwich Street in Manhattan, hopes to raise $100,000 at a fund-raiser on Monday at Latincollector, a gallery at 153 Hudson Street between Hubert and Laight Streets.
"With an overhead of just $150,000, we sent over $3.5 million worth of AIDS medication last year," Mr. Aguais said. "Now a lot of people have their eye on us." Although the program has been praised by the United Nations' AIDS organization and the World Bank, it has been operating in a legal gray area. According to the Food and Drug Administration, the program violates the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, which forbids the delivery or receipt of drugs from any source other than the manufacturer, processor, packer or distributor. 
"There is no quality assurance once the medication has left the pharmacy," said Richard Klein, the H.I.V./AIDS program director at the F.D.A. "It's a humanitarian program, but there is no guarantee of the drugs' integrity."
While the F.D.A. questions the legality of drug recycling, it has not received any reports of tainted drugs or drugs that have lost their potency being processed through Aid for AIDS and has not tried to stop its work. But Mr. Klein said that it was unlikely that the agency would hear complaints since the recipients are outside its jurisdiction.
Aid for AIDS says the group is not breaking any laws. "This absolutely does not violate the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act," said Paul O'Dwyer, the lawyer representing Aid for AIDS. "They are not going to touch any medication if there is the possibility that it was adulterated." 
Aid for AIDS does not accept unsealed bottles of liquid medicine, organizers say, and each tablet and capsule is checked to ensure it has the pharmaceutical imprint. "These are very unique drugs," Mr. Aguais said. "If someone is going to do damage to them, they are going to have to own a lab."
While the group is aware that its drugs can end up on the black market, it is adamant that what it is doing is better than doing nothing. "You can never be totally sure, but this is about surviving," Mr. Aguais said. "We did what we needed to do in order to save lives." The organization keeps a three-month supply in stock for each person. There is a long waiting list to enroll, the group says, because it still has limited drug supplies.
Organizers say that they send medicine only to people whose T-cells -- a type of white blood cell -- are down to a count of 250. Aid for AIDS requires (and pays for) blood tests done in the recipients' home countries every six months to ensure that they are adhering to the treatment. Jaime Valencia, the clinical coordinator for Aid for AIDS, says that some packages of drugs are sent directly to patients and some to doctors, and that the group keeps in regular contact with both.
"These kinds of programs have to have really strict guidelines," Mr. Aguais said, because some of the drugs are toxic and the virus can become resistant to treatment if a person does not adhere to the regimen.
Even with the strict requirements, the medication from Aid for AIDS was a godsend for a Venezuelan family: Sandra Varela, 32; her husband, Americo Teijeiro, 39; and their 6-year-old son, Alejandro. They received drugs from Aid for AIDS in 1996, shortly after finding out that they were all H.I.V.-positive. Although the family is now receiving free medicines through a health insurance program administered by the Venezuelan government, Mr. Teijeiro said that the year they were helped by Aid for AIDS was critical.
"It meant life, basically," Mr. Teijeiro, a taxi driver, said in a phone call from Caracas. "We wouldn't be here today if it hadn't been for their help. I know our son wouldn't. He was born with the virus and he is doing great, going to school and leading a normal life."
The work done by Aid for AIDS has been called "a very important initiative" by Bertil Lindblad, deputy director at the New York office of the Joint United Nations Program on H.I.V./AIDS, known as Unaids. And the AIDS Education and Treatment Initiative has sent people to Aid for AIDS. The initiative is run by Hans Binswanger, an AIDS activist and director of the rural, social and environmental development program for Africa at the World Bank.
"In the U.S. and Canada there are six or seven groups that collect medication and send them to developing countries," Mr. Binswanger said. "Aid for AIDS is the biggest and the best."
Aid for AIDS just absorbed another group based in New York, Hope's Alive, that sends medication to an orphanage in Trinidad. To Nicole Guide, the founder of Hope's Alive, discarding or not using the surplus of medication in this country is part of a "culture of waste." 
"People would rather throw away food than send it to somebody who's starving," she said. "It's the same with medicine."
The concept of recycling and even sharing AIDS drugs is not new. Michael, an H.I.V.-positive man who has donated medication to Aid for AIDS and who asked that his last name not be used, said that it is not uncommon for friends to share pills informally with someone who does not have medication handy. 
Another man who has donated drugs to Aid for AIDS said he was motivated by gratitude. "I've been very fortunate in receiving the care that I need," said Bill, who also asked that his last name not be used. "This is a good way to help others and pay back the good fortune I've had."
Aid for AIDS's work has not attracted a lot of attention from the pharmaceutical and insurance industries. Paul Macielak, president of the New York Health Plan Association, a trade organization representing managed care companies, said that drug recycling seemed to be unknown from the group's standpoint. "Health plans are not able to recoup pills or medication from members," he said. "We have no significant involvement with the issue."
One doctor who volunteers for Hope's Alive said he understands that drug regulations are vital to protect people in the United States, but he said that the situation in poor countries is so dire that the same rules should not apply.
The doctor, Dr. Edward L. Handelsman, an assistant professor of pediatrics at State University of New York Downstate Medical Center and Kings County Hospital Center in Brooklyn, travels to Trinidad for Hope's Alive to monitor children's progress. "The F.D.A.'s opinion notwithstanding, the simple fact is without the medicine, the children will die -- some right now, some later," Dr. Handelsman said. "Either you do it in a roundabout way, or you don't do it."

HEADLINE: Top Official, But No Others, To Get Raise At Port Agency 

BYLINE:  By RONALD SMOTHERS

 BODY:
At a time when the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is projecting a 23 percent drop in operating revenue, the governors of the two states have approved a 22 percent salary increase for the executive director's post. 
 But Gov. George E. Pataki yesterday rejected a Port Authority consultant's suggestion that salaries be raised anywhere from 10 percent to 40 percent for some of the agency's senior management staff and department heads. 
 "We are facing very difficult economic times," Mr. Pataki said in a statement. "We are facing the need for all of us to tighten our belts, and to consider massive pay raises like this at the Port Authority now is wrong. It's not going to happen." 
Joseph J. Seymour, who was approved as the agency's executive director on Thursday, will make 22 percent more than his predecessor, agency officials said yesterday. Mr. Seymour will receive $225,000 a year, as opposed to the $185,000 starting salary paid since March to Neil D. Levin, who died in the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center.
Unlike other salaries at the authority, which are set by the agency's 12-member board, the executive director's pay level is the prerogative of New York's governor, who by tradition gets to name the bistate agency's top staff member, said the board's vice chairman, Charles A. Gargano. The salary must then be approved by the New Jersey governor, who by tradition defers to his New York counterpart, Mr. Gargano said. "That was the level of salary that Joe Seymour wanted, and the governor agreed to it because he needed him for this position at this critical time for the Port Authority after Sept. 11," Mr. Gargano said.
The terror attack struck a financial and physical blow to the authority, whose headquarters were in the trade center. The board is considering deferring about $250 million worth of projects in a $9.5 billion, five-year capital plan adopted a year ago.
Even as the two governors were approving a raise for the executive director, Governor Pataki put the brakes on a consultant's report suggesting raises for members of the senior management staff and department heads. A board committee had commissioned the report, which listed comparable salaries in the private sector for many of the authority's senior management posts. 
Mr. Gargano said that however much those raises might be deserved, Governor Pataki -- and, he believed, Acting Gov. Donald T. DiFrancesco of New Jersey -- would not allow such increases at this time.
Tom Wilson, a spokesman for the acting governor, said he thought that Mr. DiFrancesco would favor the staff increases. 
Sean Walsh, a spokesman for New Jersey's governor-elect, James E. McGreevey, said he had not reviewed any of the salary studies for the top officials among the agency's 7,200 employees.
Still, Mr. Gargano and Lewis M. Eisenberg -- who stepped down this week as authority chairman but remains as a board member -- said that raises for top staff members were overdue, and would have to be granted at some point to keep the agency competitive in attracting and keeping qualified people. Mr. Eisenberg said that most of the agency's managers, even in this economy, could probably make "a whole lot more" if they took comparable private-sector jobs. 
Any raises for staff members must be recommended by the executive director to the board. They must then be approved by the board in a public session, and ultimately by both governors, who traditionally signal approval or disapproval by signing or not signing the minutes of board meetings at which particular actions are taken.
Mr. Seymour's salary, however, received no such public vote or discussion because it was set by Governor Pataki, Mr. Gargano said. It was impossible to determine the salary figure from the various resolutions, motions and calendar items that the board voted on Thursday.
Mr. Gargano said that the same salary study authorized by the board for senior management salaries recommended a salary of $225,000 to $250,000 for the executive director. "And the governor chose the lower end of that range," he said.
The other study recommendations that were put on hold included new salaries of $175,000 to $200,000 for those now earning between $140,000 and $160,000, and $150,000 to $175,000 for those now earning $135,000 to $145,000.
Mr. Eisenberg said the salary studies had been authorized months ago but had lain dormant as the agency coped with other, more pressing matters and was then enveloped by the Sept. 11 crisis.

HEADLINE: The Familiar and the Cozy Are Much in Favor This Year 

BYLINE:  By MICHELINE MAYNARD 

DATELINE: BLOOMINGTON, Minn., Dec. 8 

 BODY:
Just an hour after the gargantuan Mall of America opened here on this cold Saturday morning, customers were already bumping into each other amid the retro-print chenille robes and pajamas in Francoise Shirley's shop here.
 Ever since the Sept. 11 attacks, shoppers have been clamoring for comforting apparel, said Ms. Shirley, the owner of the store, Sleepyheads.com. She has been taking in $5,000 to $6,000 a day, several times what she needs to break even, and has already surpassed her fourth-quarter sales target. 
 And the same yearning for old-fashioned things, including toys from the past, is providing one of the few comforts for retailers during this recession-bound holiday season.
Indeed, while Ms. Shirley's store here was bustling, shops with familiar names like Ann Taylor and Casual Corner were practically empty inside the sprawling mall, the largest in the country. Even the big anchor department stores, including Nordstrom and Macy's, could be easily traversed during what is normally one of the busiest shopping days of the year, reflecting a trend toward specialty shopping that mall officials have seen develop all year -- and which is being echoed in retail sales nationwide.
In a typical year, the Mall of America has 35 million visitors, or as many as 900,000 a week during heavy shopping times like Christmas. Figures for the current shopping season are not yet available.
"I don't think it's crowded at all," said Mary Windmiller, a frequent visitor to the Mall of America who drove two and a half hours from Wausau, Wis., and was pleased that she did not have to fight for a parking spot and could simply stand quietly for a while, listening to folk music from a balcony above a stage. Even the line for Santa was manageable, with space available in the area cordoned off for visits.
Among the mall's 520 stores, those that sell the unique or offer tradition and patriotism are thriving this season, according to Maureen Cahill, the mall's spokeswoman. But business appears to be off at places where merchandise is similar to what customers can already find in their homes.
The 78-acre mall typically draws 40 percent of its customers from around the country, but its reach extended even further than usual last Saturday, thanks to deeply discounted fares offered by Northwest Airlines for its annual "Shop 'Til You Drop" promotion. This is the 10th holiday season that Northwest has offered the fares, which start as low as $99 for a round-trip ticket from places like Grand Rapids, Mich., and Philadelphia.
In past years, between 1,000 and 2,000 people have taken part, a Northwest spokesman said. He did not provide figures for current flights. This was the first time Northwest had offered the deal since Sept. 11.
Security measures added since airports reopened after the attacks meant a pre-dawn journey for Tricia Anne Alexander of Temperance, Mich., who joined her mother and her aunt, Linda McMahon of Toledo, Ohio, on a flight from Detroit. They arrived at 4:45 a.m., before the security checkpoints opened, for their 7:05 a.m. takeoff.
Mrs. McMahon, making her first plane trip since Sept. 11, said she felt "apprehensive." But Ms. Alexander, armed with a list of 21 stores she hoped to visit, was ready to go. "I have six hours," Ms. Alexander said. "I have this down to a science."
The flight was uneventful, and by midday, the women were taking a break at a coffee bar. Mrs. McMahon and Sharon Alexander showed off bracelets featuring the American flag in rhinestones. Then, all three headed off for more shopping before their 8 p.m. return flight.
To draw more shoppers, the mall's operators are trying to expand offerings that seem particularly popular this year. They cleared out a store they had operated in a prime location to sell Mall of America souvenirs and offered the space, including the lights and fixtures, to Ms. Shirley so she could open a second shop. The new store is called Hollywood Legends and features an entire section inspired by Lucille Ball. 
Just one floor above, another new shop, the 911 Marketplace, was doing a brisk business selling New York Fire Department T-shirts and baseball caps, as well as coffee mugs, key chains, toys and other related gifts.
Sean Moriarty and Tom McDonough, two local firefighters, opened 911 Marketplace -- originally meant to refer only to the emergency phone number -- for business last summer before the terrorist attacks. The store was already deluged with customers when Sept. 11 turned police, fire and emergency workers into national heroes. Now, customers wait in the hallway outside until there is room to browse.
"It's really something," Mr. Moriarty said.
At the mall's Nordstrom store, however, the atmosphere was more subdued. The main floor at Nordstrom at first appeared jam packed, but the traffic was helped by a dozen black-clad Estee Lauder makeup artists offering free makeovers, and by other cosmeticians giving out mini-manicures.
Upstairs on the apparel floors, the aisles were lightly traveled. Entire departments, including gifts, were empty, and even at the height of the lunch hour, it was easy to get a seat in the cafe. Sales clerks rushed to help customers, and markdowns abounded -- 25 percent, 40 percent and even 50 percent off on names like Ellen Tracy, Ralph Lauren and Nordstrom's own Caslon line.
Nordstrom would not comment on sales of any individual store.
Tracee Aube, the owner of the Afternoon, a gift shop that has been open since 1994, recalls the entire mall being that quiet during the fall. The mall was evacuated on Sept. 11. Business remained tepid through October, particularly on Halloween, when an Internet rumor cited the mall for an attack. All this caused Ms. Aube to fear for the Christmas season.
But in recent weeks, her shop has been bustling once again, with customers spending, on average, about $50 apiece. Pointing to a wall of blown-glass ornaments, Ms. Aube said: "We can move faster than Target or Dayton's. That's the only thing that saves us."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; 
Finance Minister Of Argentina Resigns Post

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

 BODY:
The uncertainty of Argentina's precarious financial situation deepened yesterday when Daniel Marx, the finance secretary, resigned.
 Mr. Marx stepped down as Argentina paid $700 million in short-term debt owed to local banks by forcing pension funds to buy government bonds. The payment was the first of two in December that would hold off a default on its public debt.. Argentina has been struggling to contain its public debt, now totaling about $132 billion, after four years of recession. 
 In discussing his decision, Mr. Marx suggested that it was time for someone else to oversee the government's negotiations with its creditors. "It's a cycle," he said. "I had also some personal things to deal with."
Mr. Marx added that he would still work with the government, in a capacity that had not yet been formalized. "I agreed to continue to work on the national debt issues for Argentina," he said.
In the last few weeks, working with the economy minister, Domingo Cavallo, Mr. Marx had been trying to persuade Argentina's foreign creditors to accept lower interest rates on existing debts. Domestic creditors already agreed, under some duress, to swap roughly $40 billion in obligations for new loans. Mr. Marx said that his foreign consultations had been proceeding "according to schedule."
There was no doubt, however, that Mr. Marx's job had recently become tougher. The International Monetary Fund decided last week to delay the release of $1.3 billion in aid, which is needed to cover a budget shortfall. During the last few months, political infighting has eroded the government's ability to adhere to the zero-deficit rule favored by the I.M.F. and promised by Mr. Cavallo.
Mr. Marx's resignation also followed a national strike on Thursday by union members, shopkeepers and unemployed workers, which brought the country close to a standstill. The strikers were protesting federal budget cuts and restrictions on withdrawals from bank accounts.
Mr. Cavallo instituted the banking controls on Dec. 1 to stave off a run on Argentina's banks. Depositors who worried that the peso's fixed one-to-one exchange rate with the dollar was about to be broken by a devaluation, despite Mr. Cavallo's insistence to the contrary, were withdrawing dollars from bank accounts. A sudden, widespread drop in deposits threatened to choke economic activity and worsen the country's financial troubles.
The controls were a sign of the financial pressures on Argentina, according to Vincent Truglia, an analyst at Moody's. "They were indicative of the very difficult situation that the country was in and continues to be in," he said.
Mr. Marx declined to say in an interview whether he had favored imposing the restrictions.
Mr. Marx became finance secretary in December 1999 after a career in private finance and a stint on the board of Argentina's central bank. The finance secretary is effectively the economy minister's deputy, with specific responsibility for the public debt.
Mr. Marx kept his job through the resignation and replacement of two economy ministers, Jose Luis Machinea and Ricardo Lopez-Murphy, and the return of Mr. Cavallo to government. His technical knowledge and strong relations with Argentina's foreign creditors won him considerable respect at home and abroad.
Mr. Marx is known for favoring market-based rather than regulatory solutions to economic problems, a reputation shared by Julio Dreizzen, who resigned as finance undersecretary on Oct. 29, citing personal reasons.
Mr. Marx's departure may pave the way for Miguel Kiguel, an economist from the Justicialist opposition party, to join Mr. Cavallo's team. On Thursday, Argentina's president, Fernando de la Rua, met with Carlos Saul Menem, a former president and leader of the Justicialists, to discuss economic strategy. The appointment of Mr. Kiguel to succeed Mr. Marx may be seen as a way to bring the Justicialists into Mr. De La Rua's ruling coalition, forming a sort of national unity government to address the economy.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 19, 2001

 CORRECTION:
A headline in Business Day on Saturday about the resignation of Daniel Marx, a senior Argentine government official, misstated his title. Mr. Marx holds the post of finance secretary, which is below cabinet level. He is not finance minister; Argentina does not have a finance ministry.
Because of editing errors, a biographical sketch on Saturday about two family members who worked together at Cantor Fitzgerald and died at the World Trade Center misspelled their surname in some copies and at one point misstated their relationship. They were Frederick J. and Michele L. Hoffmann, not Hoffman -- father and daughter, not uncle and niece.

LOAD-DATE: December 15, 2001 TAt least, he said, there is "nobody wondering, 'How did Greg feel about me?' " OLEH WENGERCHUKSoul Mates From Age 2Oleh Wengerchuk and his wife, Oksana, met as children, when their families were interred at a German displacement camp when they were toddlers. Their families were Ukrainian. "I don't remember him from that time," Mrs. Wengerchuk said. "My mother used to tell me that we would play together all the time, he and his brother and I. We were like the three musketeers. We were only 2 or 3 years old."Through the years, and in the turmoil after the war, the two families kept in touch. Hers ended up in South Bend, Ind., while his immigrated to New York a year later. When her father died, her family moved to Trenton, N.J., and they visited the Wengerchuks. Oleh Wengerchuk was in the Army. "We fell in love, which wasn't planned," Mrs. Wengerchuk said. "We had a long history. We were like soul mates."Fast-forward to the year 2001. He was a transportation designer for the Washington Group International, with an office on the 91st floor of 2 World Trade Center. The couple had a nice home in Centerpoint, N.Y., on Long Island. They loved to entertain.One of Mr. Wengerchuk's passions was going sailing with his brother. The Wengerchuks had a daughter, Andrea, who is 23, and just out of college. She had come home to live with her parents again; father and daughter were forging an adult friendship.The weekend before Sept. 11, the couple had friends over for dinner. At the end, as they sat in the twilight, Mr. Wengerchuk, 56, took his wife's hand and kissed it, as he often did after these nights of wine and good conversation. "He told me, 'I just want you to know how much I appreciate everything you do for me. If one of us has to go first, I hope it's me because I can't imagine life without you.' " DAVID T. WOOLEYA Decorating OfficerAnyone could see that it was a strange combination of jobs, fighting fires and interior decorating. But not David T. Wooley. Captain of Ladder Company 4 in Midtown Manhattan, he also put up wallpaper on the side, turning it into a family affair that included his son, brother and cousin. "He did that because my mother was always asking him to decorate around the house," said his son, David Jr. "He changed the wallpaper so often, and he was so good at it, that he decided to make it his second career. He did it since 1985 or 1986."Sure, hanging wallpaper did not quite pack the rush of running into a blaze. But in Captain Wooley's crew were his brother Burt (another firefighter), his cousin Jeff and his son. "It was time we spent together, and it was almost like not working," David Wooley Jr. said.As they beautified houses, Captain Wooley, 53, would tune in to a politically conservative radio station. Then his son would switch the dial to a liberal station. That was how it went between the two of them -- listen to politics, debate about it, laugh over it.Captain Wooley's son made fun of him when he took a job putting up wallpaper in the Westchester home of Bill and Hillary Clinton. Meeting them did not change the captain's political leanings. But Captain Wooley was what his son called a "people person," and he told his son afterward that the Clintons were "nice and personable." CHRISTOPHER M. DUFFYNice Suits, Hawaiian ShirtsChristopher M. Duffy was determined. At 160 pounds, he was the fullback on his high school football team. He was captain of his lacrosse team and spent a good part of his time on the field knocking other players down.But when his two brothers, one older and one younger, both grew to over 6 feet tall and Mr. Duffy stopped at 5-foot-10, he decided he just was not big enough. So he made up for it with muscle. "Chris was the most ferocious of the three of them," said John Duffy, Chris's father.Chris Duffy was known for his weekend "Duff Jam" parties in high school. When his parents went away, Mr. Duffy and his friends would play. "They covered their tracks," said his father. "But over the years we learned about the extent of the parties."Mr. Duffy, 23, started working at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, where his father is president, as an assistant equity trader after graduating from Villanova in 2000. His sister Kara said her brother was a smart dresser, loving to shop at stores like Hugo Boss. Still, outside the office he was often seen in flip-flops and a Hawaiian shirt. His 12 closest friends, who were honorary pallbearers at his memorial service, wore suits -- and flip-flops. JIM CLEERE'Good Man.' Good Voice.That October night in 1977, Jean Rieger, a divorced mother with a 10-year-old daughter, got down on her knees and prayed to God to send her "a good man" to marry.When she got up, the phone rang. On the other end was Jim Cleere, a divorced father of two sons, ages 12 and 10.They married one year later.Mr. Cleere, vice president of Seabury & Smith, a division of Marsh & McLennan, was in New York Sept. 11 for a meeting at the insurance brokerage firm on the 96th floor of 1 World Trade Center. Mr. Cleere, 55, was across the street at the Marriott Hotel when the first plane struck the north tower. He called his wife at their home in Newton, Iowa. They were on the phone when the second plane struck the south tower."He said he was O.K. and would be coming home," said Jean Cleere. "That was our last conversation."Mrs. Cleere says her husband was a man of faith. "He had a deep, rich baritone and sang all the time," she said, mostly the old-time hymns.She loved that voice of his. That's why she hasn't changed her answering machine tape. It has Mr. Cleere's voice on it. TYRONE MAYThe Music, and Party, Man Tyrone May's music collection was vast: hundreds and hundreds of records and CD's, running the gamut from reggae and disco to rhythm and blues. And his apartment in Rahway, N.J., was littered with the announcements for record fairs he received in the mail each month. Naturally, people leapt to conclusions."Everybody comes into the apartment and says, 'Who's the D.J.?' " said Mr. May's wife, Marva May. The truth is that on any given day, Mr. May, 44, an auditor with the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance, was more likely to be crunching numbers than spinning records. But he had an expert ear and, more important, the party-planning skills of a born impresario. Nearly every December, Mr. May would rent a club somewhere in the city and throw a huge dance party for a few hundred friends and family members. By early September, he had a date (Dec. 15) and location (a club in Brooklyn). On Sept. 11, before he left home for 2 World Trade Center, Mr. May told his wife to keep an eye out for a fax from the agency that was designing the tickets for the event."I still have the fax," said Mrs. May, who is saving many of her husband's possessions for their son, Tyrone Jr., 2. "Everything is the same way since he left." The Confirmed DeadFollowing are the names of the people most recently confirmed to have died in the World Trade Center disaster, according to the New York City medical examiner's office, which said the victims' families had been notified.

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Europe: Sweden: Electrolux Cuts More Jobs 

BYLINE:  By Suzanne Kapner (NYT) 

 BODY:
 Electrolux, the Swedish appliance maker, said it would eliminate a further 2,800 jobs, making the total number of staff reductions this year 6,900, or 8 percent of its work force. Electrolux, the maker of Frigidaire refrigerators and Eureka vacuum cleaners, said it might cut more jobs next year if the economy did not improve. Electrolux shares fell 96 cents and closed at $28.89. The company said it would take a 1.5 billion kronor ($142 million) charge to account for the job reductions. The company said it expected to save 1.4 billion kronor by the end of 2003, after which it would save 940 million kronor a year by operating with less staff. Other appliance makers have struggled as consumers delay large purchases in the face of rising unemployment and an economic slowdown. Moulinex S.A. of France was liquidated in October, and Maytag of the United States said last week that it would eliminate 200 jobs.

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Europe: Turkey: I.M.F. Pact Paves Way For Loan 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
 Turkey and the International Monetary Fund agreed on a three-year economic program, clearing the way for new aid from the lender to close a $10 billion financing gap through the end of next year. The agreement with Turkey, a United States ally in the war against terrorism, follows by a month an I.M.F. promise to provide $10 billion in financing, in what would be the fund's third infusion of aid in the last year. 
The economy minister, Kemal Dervis, has argued that the Sept. 11 attacks undercut Turkey's ability to emerge from its worse recession since World War II. "The first priority under the new program will be to make Turkey's economy more robust to shocks and prevent future crises," the fund said in a statement.

HEADLINE: Grounded by an Income Gap 

BYLINE:  By ALEXANDER STILLE 

 BODY:
For 30 years the gap between the richest Americans and everyone else has been growing so much that the level of inequality is higher than in any other industrialized nation.
 What no one can quite figure out, though, is why, or even whether anything should be done about it. 
 "Why there has been increasing inequality in this country has been one of the big puzzles in our field and has absorbed a lot of intellectual effort," said Martin Feldstein, a professor of economics at Harvard University and the chairman of President Ronald Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers. "But if you ask me whether we should worry about the fact that some people on Wall Street and basketball players are making a lot of money, I say no."
With inequality growing through out the industrialized world, Mr. Feldstein, like many economists, has come to see inequality as a basic feature of the new high-tech economic scene, the natural consequence of an economy that has begun to reward talent, skills, education and entrepreneurial risk with increasing efficiency. 
"There is no doubt that market forces have spoken in favor of more inequality," said Richard Freeman, a professor of economics at Harvard. Just look at the figures. Most of the incredible wealth generated during the 1990's boom went to the richest of the rich. "Forty-seven percent of the total real income gain between 1983 and 1998 accrued to the top 1 percent of income recipients, 42 percent went to the next 19 percent, and 12 percent accrued to the bottom 80 percent," writes Edward Wolff, an economics professor at New York University in a new edition of his book "Top Heavy" (New Press), about growing economic inequality.
In the 90's only the people at the very top and very bottom made any real improvement. Wages for full-time male workers, for example, have grown only 1.3 percent since 1989. The richest 10 percent of American households, economists point out, have 34.5 percent more financial wealth than the average family. These changes have persisted through Democratic and Republican administrations and began at the same time in Britain, even before Margaret Thatcher's market-oriented policies, Mr. Wolff said, indicating that they are not simply the product of economic policy but reflect deep structural changes in the economy. The leading hypotheses are technological advances, increases in trade and imports, growing immigration and declining union membership.
But where economists split is whether anything should be done about the divide. "The question is whether you lean against the wind of the market to try to preserve decent living standards for working and poor people," Mr. Freeman said. "Europe and Japan are leaning against the wind."
Many liberal economists say the United States should, too. 
Levels of equality and inequality play a large role in people's sense of satisfaction or dissatisfaction with their lot in life, said Ronald Inglehart, a sociology professor at the University of Michigan, who for 30 years has been conducting something called the World Values Survey. "Interestingly the levels of dissatisfaction are highest in both the most equal countries in the world, the Communist countries or those that have just emerged from Communism, and also those with very high levels of inequality," he said. 
The only way you can achieve total equality is through coercion, he said, which makes people feel they have no control over their lives and no way to benefit from their labor. But highly unequal, extremely stratified societies, where people feel crushed by the economic power of others, breed similar dissatisfaction.
Conservative economists insist that the problem with the new economy is not that some people make a lot of money but a series of noneconomic factors that are holding others back. "The problem is not inequality but poverty," Mr. Feldstein said. Poor education, the breakdown of the family and what he terms "low cognitive ability," together, may be responsible for holding back many of those mired in persistent poverty. He added that some poor people may choose not to work as hard as investment bankers working 70 hours a week, or to skip school, and so earn less.
James Heckman, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago, argued: "We have to look at some of the basic structural reasons why we have so many unskilled, poorly educated, poorly motivated people in our society. One of the most amazing phenomena of recent years is why so many people, especially minorities, have not responded to the opportunities out there. There has been a big increase in demand for skills, educated blacks have done very well, but college completion rates have leveled off."
Perhaps never before, economists say, has education been such an important factor in predicting future earnings. Marvin Kosters, a senior economist with the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington, said the earning advantage for those who attend college over those who do not has doubled to about 60 percent from 30 percent in the early 1970's. 
"Even finishing high school improves your income by about 30 percent," Mr. Heckman said. 
One of the biggest reasons people fail to finish school is teenage pregnancy and the strains of running a household as a single parent. "More than 40 percent of all female-headed families with children had incomes below the poverty line," Prof. Marc L. Miringoff of Fordham University writes in his recent book, "The Social Health of the Nation" (Oxford University Press).
Meanwhile the high school dropout rate for Hispanics -- the fastest-growing ethnic group in the country -- remains more than 30 percent, more than twice that of blacks and nearly three times that of non-Latino whites. 
David Ellwood, a liberal economist who does worry about inequality, said this may be just the beginning of a trend toward greater inequality. "We are in the midst of two huge demographic changes," he said. "In the last 20 years our prime labor force -- people between 25 and 54 -- grew by 20 million people, 16 million of them native born. In the next 20 years the growth of that labor force will be zero, all growth will be by immigrants and by older workers." Immigrants generally do not have the same education and language skills as native-born workers, he said, meaning that there will be fewer skilled laborers and more unskilled, accentuating the income gap.
"The other thing that is happening is a slowdown in the upgrading of the work force," Mr. Ellwood added. "Baby boomers got a lot more education than their parents. There was a lot of upgrading in skills. But the children of baby boomers are not more educated than their parents. This would mean that wage inequality could increase rapidly." 
Economists like Mr. Feldstein consider the level of inequality -- measured by something economists call the Gini quotient -- irrelevant. "If the stock market goes up, which we generally regard as a good thing, the Gini quotient may well go up, too, as stockholders get richer," he said. "If the stock market collapses and everyone gets poorer, the Gini quotient would go down. So I think that's the wrong way to focus the question." If one person's good fortune does not harm others, why should we worry? 
The problem, said Alan Krueger, an economist at Princeton University, is that Mr. Feldstein's analysis looks at money in the abstract. "There is a relationship between economic power and political power," he said, noting that as the income gap has increased, political participation among those at the bottom of the economic ladder has dropped precipitously. Poorer people may be dropping out of the process because they feel they have no voice.
To Mr. Ellwood a host of social ills come with growing inequality. Problems like drug use, teenage pregnancy, crime and lowered life expectancy all have gotten worse with widening income inequality, while these improved somewhat when the poverty rate went down and real wages went up in the late 90's. 
"If you are born to a woman in the bottom quarter of the income scale or grow up in the a single-parent household, the odds that you will go on to college, even if you have the same grades and the same test scores, are much lower," Mr. Ellwood said. 
Curiously, this is a point on which the views of conservatives like Mr. Heckman converge with those of liberal economists. 
"Never has the accident of birth mattered more," Mr. Heckman said. "If I am born to educated, supportive parents, my chances of doing well are totally different than if I were born to a single parent or abusive parents. I am a University of Chicago libertarian, but this is a case of market failure: children don't get to 'buy' their parents, and so there has to be some kind of intervention to make up for these environmental differences."
Even Adam Smith, the prophet of laissez-faire economics, had a strong concern for equity if not equality. "No society can surely be flourishing and happy, of which the far greater part of the members are poor and miserable," he wrote. "It is but equity, besides, that they who feed, clothe and lodge the whole body of the people should have such a share of the produce of their own labor as to be themselves tolerably well fed, clothed and lodged."

HEADLINE: As the War Shifts Alliances, Oil Deals Follow 

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE with SABRINA TAVERNISE 

 BODY:
There is no oil in Afghanistan, but there are oil politics, and Washington is subtly tending to them, using the promise of energy investments in Central Asia to nurture a budding set of political alliances in the region with Russia, Kazakhstan and, to some extent, Uzbekistan. 
 Since the Sept. 11 attacks, the United States has lauded the region as a stable oil supplier, in a tacit comparison with the Persian Gulf states that have been viewed lately as less cooperative. The State Department is exploring the potential for post-Taliban energy projects in the region, which has more than 6 percent of the world's proven oil reserves and almost 40 percent of its gas reserves. 
 The United States government cannot compel investment, but it can clear away diplomatic and bureaucratic obstacles. Western oil companies say warming relations with regional powers could yield small openings. Better ties between Russia and the United States, for example, have accelerated a thaw that began more than a year ago over pipeline routes from the Caspian Sea to the West. 
"The sharp edges are off that discussion, and things are seen as less of a threat," said Martijn Minderhoud, a senior regional vice president for Royal Dutch/Shell. 
But any payoff remains distant. The entrenched problems that hobbled oil investment in Russia and Central Asia before September still exist. Oil companies and regional experts wonder whether significant new oil and gas reservoirs will be opened to foreign investment, whether onerous laws and tax codes will be reworked and whether persistent corruption can be reduced.
"This is a period of reassessments among oil companies, and a time of cautious optimism," said Scott Horton, a partner at the law firm of Patterson, Belknap Webb & Tyler in Manhattan. "But all have been badly burned in the former Soviet Union before." 
Skeptics, especially in the Islamic world, contend that oil interests lie at the heart of the West's war in Afghanistan. "The Pipeline of Greed," read the headline on a recent article in the Pakistani newspaper Dawn about the American-led attacks on the Taliban and Al Qaeda. "The war on terrorism may well be a war for resources," it said.
The Bush administration says that its war goals have been clear -- and do not involve oil. "There is no such hidden agenda," said an administration official. "Operation Enduring Freedom is meant to get rid of terrorism in Afghanistan, Central Asia and the surrounding areas."
Still, the administration lately has discreetly overlooked the pitfalls of doing business in the former Soviet Union. During a visit a week ago to Kazakhstan, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said he was "particularly impressed" with the money that American oil companies were investing there. He estimated that $200 billion could flow into Kazakhstan during the next 5 to 10 years.
Two weeks earlier, on a visit to Russia, Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham championed the cause of increased foreign investment in Russia's oil industry. On the same trip, David J. O'Reilly, the chairman of ChevronTexaco, said his company was reviewing possible projects in the Russian Far East. 
Pipelines are the clearest realm of progress. For years the United States and Russia clashed over routes to transport oil and gas from the Caspian Sea region to lucrative Western markets -- and the political and economic power that control of those networks conferred.
Russia wanted pipelines built on its territory, and some were. The United States backed a pipeline from Baku, Azerbaijan, to the Turkish Mediterranean port of Ceyhan, bypassing Russia entirely. The pipeline consortium is led by BP and represented by Baker & Botts, the law firm of James A. Baker III, a Bush family confidant and former secretary of state.
Over the last year, Russia's opposition to that route has subsided, and in October, the oil ministry invited BP to make a presentation about it to domestic oil companies. Industry analysts said that meeting would have been unthinkable if ties between the United States and Russia had not improved. Russia's largest oil company, Lukoil, confirmed that it was seriously looking into investing in the project.
The arc of countries in Central Asia where Western oil companies work grazes Afghanistan. But the value of Afghanistan itself, if any, might be as a pipeline route. 
Four years ago, the Unocal Corp. -- with the State Department's backing -- negotiated with the Taliban to build a pipeline through Afghanistan linking Turkmenistan, which is rich in natural gas but landlocked, to Pakistan. Although Pakistan has called for reviving the pipeline, industry experts say oil companies are so far not interested. 
But the plan could be dusted off.
"Once we bomb the hell out of Afghanistan, we will have to cough up some projects there, and this pipeline is one of them," said Matthew J. Sagers of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a research and consulting group. "Can oil companies be persuaded by the United States? It has happened before. Look at Baku-Ceyhan."
That project exemplifies how Washington fosters oil investment. The White House began advocating the Baku-Ceyhan route about five years ago, but oil companies in the Caspian argued that it made little economic sense. At that time, there was little oil from the Caspian Sea. But there was plenty of natural gas, and companies needed a pipeline for it.
They agreed to develop the Baku-Ceyhan oil pipeline if they could get the American government's help to build a parallel gas pipeline, a person close to the Baku-Ceyhan consortium said. The presence of an Iranian company, OIEC, as a 10 percent shareholder in the gas pipeline consortium might have prompted the United States to block the project. But it did not, and both pipelines are now proceeding.
This fall, the antiterrorism campaign raised oil companies' hopes that relations between Iran and the United States might improve. The industry's favored export route for Caspian oil is through Iran. But while the Bush administration confirms that Iran is sharing intelligence about Afghanistan with the United States, the president is maintaining Washington's longstanding policy against doing business with Tehran.
Western oil companies, showing a bit more faith than before in Central Asia and Russia, are gingerly looking for investment opportunities, industry consultants said. But the barriers are significant. 
Through the 1990's, the United States fostered good relations with Kazakhstan to circumvent Moscow. But the relationship cooled when the Justice Department last year began investigating accusations of high-level corruption in oil projects there. 
That investigation continues, but Kazakhstan -- which holds about 88 percent of Central Asia's oil wealth -- has offered the United States use of its airspace and military bases for the war. Its president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, is due in Washington next Friday to meet with President Bush and then will travel to Texas to mingle with oil executives.
Russia would seem the most attractive candidate for investment, given its warming relations with the United States -- missile defense aside -- and its relatively extensive economic changes.
But Russia is hard to figure. Its recent decision to acquiesce to OPEC's demand to cut exports has been interpreted in differing ways. Moscow might have come under American pressure to go along with the Middle East to protect oil prices, and so ensure political stability among the United States' Arab allies. Or the cut, which went against the official position of the United States, might have defied Washington.
Either way, Western oil companies understand, Russia's underlying motivation is the same: the Russians pursue their interests, which occasionally coincide with America's. 
Those Russian interests still preclude serious involvement by Western oil companies in developing most Russian fields, except for complex offshore projects. Russia has tarried in developing tax laws and a production-sharing agreement for foreign oil concerns. Russian politicians fear surrendering oil to foreigners. After years of courting their wealthier and more-experienced Western counterparts, Russian oil companies, made richer by high oil prices, mostly want to go it alone. 
"In the last year, the attitude of Russian oil companies to Western ones has changed," said Yevgeny Khartukov, general director of the International Center for Petroleum Business Studies, a nonprofit research and consulting group in Moscow. "Now they don't need them."

HEADLINE: Verizon Seeks Advantage Over Smaller Competitors 

BYLINE:  By JAYSON BLAIR

 BODY:
Verizon Communications, New York's local phone carrier, has begun a lobbying effort in the wake of the terrorist attack on Sept. 11 that would give the company a competitive advantage, and its rivals are criticizing it for trying to profit from the disaster. 
 Since Sept. 11, Verizon executives and lobbyists have argued in Albany that the rates competitors pay to lease space on its networks should be increased to pay for new security and backup systems necessary in light of the attack. 
 In Washington, Verizon lobbyists have asked federal regulators to make it more difficult for competitors to lease space on its network, arguing that its success in restoring phone service in Lower Manhattan proves that only a big company could handle maintenance, recovery and security in the wake of such a disaster.
The trade center collapse knocked out nearly 300,000 telephone lines and damaged a central office that ran much of Verizon's network in Lower Manhattan, one of the most congested telecommunications hubs in the world. Verizon has been praised by many for its efforts to quickly restore phone service after the attack. But the company has also been criticized for not restoring service to some customers, particularly in Chinatown and other parts of Lower Manhattan, where Verizon says about 10,000 of its lines still do not work. 
"Think about what happened at ground zero and ask yourself who else could do what we did," Ivan Seidenberg, the co-chief executive of Verizon, said during a speech at the National Press Club in Washington last week. 
Mr. Seidenberg and other Verizon executives have advocated ending the practice of encouraging smaller competitors to lease lines on its local telephone networks and then resell them to consumers. Verizon has long argued that this competitive business model was flawed.
The new twist is that Verizon's leaders and advocates have been arguing since Sept. 11 that all competitors should eventually be forced to build their own networks, in part because of the security and logistical challenges that became clear after the attack and during the recovery efforts.
"Verizon has really kicked up its public policy and lobbying presence since Sept. 11," said Michael Morrissey, vice president for law and government affairs at AT&T. "They did a good P.R. job in terms of the recovery efforts; frankly, they did a good job with recovery, although others did just as well."
But he added, "It comes as no surprise that their kind of solution is that if you want to take care of the problems of Sept. 11 and wipe out the threat of terrorism, 'wipe out my competitors.' "
Verizon, an offspring of the old Bell network formed when Bell Atlantic and GTE merged last year, operates more than 128.5 million phone lines in 31 states and the District of Columbia. The company is New York's main local telephone company. 
Mr. Seidenberg said that he would welcome competition from companies with the same scale as Verizon, but that smaller ones that lease lines on a local carrier's network would not be able to ensure security, build backup systems and pull off a recovery of the scale of what was needed after Sept. 11.
Verizon has made no public estimate of the total cost of the disaster. But company officials have told Wall Street analysts that they believe most of the cost will be covered by insurance. 
In a speech last month at the Chief Executive Club in Boston, Chuck Lee, Verizon's chairman and other co-chief executive, made remarks similar to Mr. Seidenberg's. "For all the focus on the viability of small niche competitors in the communications industry, this was one instance where, when push came to shove, scale mattered," Mr. Lee said of the recovery efforts. 
The Telecommunications Act of 1996 allowed local carriers to enter the long distance business as they allowed other companies to compete with them in the local arena. The equation has turned out better for the local carriers, the Baby Bells, which have been able to make significant inroads into long distance service as other competitors have had a hard time piercing into their local customer base.
The telecommunications act forces Verizon to sell access to its network to competitors at a price that is capped by the New York State Public Service Commission. Verizon officials have long said those prices are too low, and they have repeated that with increasing insistency since Sept. 11. 
All of Verizon's local competitors contend that they are not profitable in New York.
In response to a question from the Public Service Commission about the impact of the terrorist attacks, Verizon's regulatory counsel, Joseph A. Post, wrote a letter on Oct. 9 asking that the commission take into consideration the extra security costs when it reviews the amount that Verizon could charge for leasing the lines.
He also said that the small competitors that lease lines "did not and could not contribute in a meaningful way to the restoration of vital telecommunications services in Manhattan."
The Verizon lobbying efforts led three industry groups that are financed by Verizon's small competitors -- the Competitive Telecommunications Association, the Association of Communications Enterprises and the Association for Local Telecommunications -- to sharply rebuke the company in a letter to the Federal Communications Commission.
"Verizon's management is attempting to gain commercial advantage from these sad events," the letter read. "Verizon is attempting to use this tragedy to gain nothing less than a de facto repeal of the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996, and a return to an integrated monopoly." 
The letter went on to say, "The scale and scope of the Verizon network is the cumulative byproduct of nearly 100 years of monopoly service and government protection. The core vision of the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 -- that these inherited scale and scope economies are to be shared with competitors -- is as important today, in the wake of Sept. 11, as it was on the day the act was passed."
Verizon executives and lobbyists have said that there are concerns about security when it comes to allowing technicians from competitors into its offices. More important, the Verizon officials have said that the size of their company allowed them to pull in resources from all over the region for repair efforts, and that the size of Verizon's network allowed them to more easily reroute service.
In the days and weeks after the attack, as they scrambled to get the New York Stock Exchange and other Lower Manhattan customers back online, Verizon officials warned that they would have to invest untold amounts of money into improving security and making a backup system for telephone service. The moves would include increasing physical security, like making its offices less vulnerable to blasts and fires, as well as network security, like adding computerized switches that could be easily replaced.

HEADLINE: Moody's Cuts Calpine's Credit Rating to Junk 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif. Dec. 14 

 BODY:
Moody's Investors Service cut the credit rating of Calpine today to junk, causing its shares to fall to a two-year low and its bonds to drop to 78 cents on the dollar.
 A lower credit rating could hamper Calpine's effort to secure as much as $1.5 billion to finance power plants under construction. Moody's lowered the rating to Ba1, the highest junk level, from Baa3, the lowest investment grade. Further cuts are possible, affecting $11.6 billion in debt, the ratings company said. 
 Moody's review and subsequent ratings reduction unnerved investors because after Enron, the energy trader, had its rating reduced, it filed for bankruptcy.
Calpine's shares, down 40 percent the last month, fell $2.85, or nearly 18 percent, to $13.20, the lowest closing price since Oct. 28. Its 8.5 percent notes maturing in 2011 traded at 78 cents on the dollar, to yield 12.6 percent, from more than 84 cents on Thursday. The bonds traded above 100 as recently as November.
Also today, Moody's cut the credit ratings of Dynegy Holdings, a unit of Dynegy Inc., to Baa3. Moody's said said further cuts are possible. It cut Dynegy Holdings' senior unsecured rating by one level, to the lowest on its investment-grade scale, and it lowered the commercial paper rating to P3 from P2. Dynegy shares, which dropped $1.64, to $24.94, fell to $23 in after-hours trading.
Moody's said it was concerned about Dynegy's high debt levels relative to other similarly rated companies. Dynegy, which abandoned its bid to acquire Enron, has about $5 billion in debt securities that are affected by the downgrade, Moody's said. That compares with the company's $8 billion stock market value.
On Thursday, a top Dynegy official told Dow Jones that it has put long-term building plans on hold indefinitely as power companies' ability to obtain financing for new projects had been damaged by the collapse of Enron. Dynegy is still on target to bring four plants producing 2,300 megawatts of new power on line by the summer of 2003, the official said.
Moody's said it lowered its rating on Calpine because the company must manage the "significant debt burden" it incurred for its expansion plan "in the face of modest operating profits."
Standard & Poor's affirmed its BB+ rating, the highest junk grade, on Dec. 12 and is not considering changing the rating.
Fitch Inc., another ratings company, also placed Calpine on watch for a downgrade, saying that "while the company's operating fundamentals are sound, the financial profile is aggressive."
Stoking the concern is the comparisons some investors are drawing between Calpine and Enron. Both companies financed some of their business with off-balance-sheet debt and both trade power, which requires a credit rating high enough to finance positions. Calpine and Enron also used the same auditor, Andersen.
Calpine is relying on loans to pay for power plant construction. Calpine plans to almost double its generating capacity in coming years, building and expanding enough plants to light 18.4 million average homes.
The company, based in San Jose, has about $190 million in debt that does not appear on the balance sheet, spread over seven power-plant projects, a spokeswoman, Katherine Potter, said. The company has bought the interests of some partners, reducing off-books debt from about $300 million on Sept. 30, Ms. Potter said.
"In the wake of Enron, the mild weather and the economic downturn, these are short-term difficulties, but our long-term strategy remains in place," Ms. Potter said.

Vivendi Universal Plans To Challenge Media Giants
Vivendi Universal of France has lined up a set of deals intended to challenge the American entertainment giants in their struggle to dominate the production and distribution of movies and television programs.
 The company will place its programming on five satellite television channels, giving Vivendi its own distribution capabilities for the first time. As soon as Monday, Vivendi hopes to announce an agreement giving it control of USA Networks. At the same time, Vivendi may announce that it is putting its American movie and television holdings under the control of one of the entertainment industry's most experienced executives, Barry Diller.

NBC Is Said to Lose N.B.A. Contract
Starting next season, ESPN and ABC Sports will pay nearly $1.6 billion over four years to televise National Basketball Association games, two industry executives said. The new contracts, which are to be announced soon, will usher NBC Sports out and give cable TV its largest role in a major league sport. S1.

Factory Production Drops Slightly
Industrial production dropped for the fourth consecutive month in November, the Federal Reserve said, down 0.3 percent after a 0.9 percent drop in October. Separately, the government reported that falling food and energy costs kept the Consumer Price Index gauge of inflation flat last month after a 0.3 percent decline in October and that business inventories dropped 1.4 percent in October.

Kirin Brewery Stake in San Miguel
Kirin Brewery said it would pay 27.9 billion Philippine pesos ($536 million) for a 15 percent stake in the beer and beverage conglomerate San Miguel, tapping into Asia's fast-growing thirst for beer and providing what may be crucial boardroom support for San Miguel's embattled chairman, Eduardo M. Cojuangco Jr., above. Despite high marks from investors, Mr. Cojuangco is tainted by his friendships with the former dictator Ferdinand E. Marcos and with Joseph E. Estrada, who was discredited and ousted from the Philippine presidency in January. C3.

Small Uptick After a Week of Losses
Stocks eked out gains after a late afternoon bounce, capping a week of losses amid increasing investor unease.

Containing Al Qaeda, Reviewing Bin Laden, Seeking Aid at Home

BYLINE:  By ROBERT D. McFADDEN 

 BODY:
Two months ago, the war in Afghanistan seemed dauntingly open-ended. Taliban and Al Qaeda forces controlled 90 percent of the land. The local opposition was in disarray. Mullah Muhammad Omar reigned in Kabul and blustered in Kandahar. Finding Osama bin Laden seemed hopeless.
 By yesterday, the Taliban had been beaten, Mullah Omar was in hiding, a new government was preparing to take power in Kabul, and the last remnants of Al Qaeda were under heavy attack in the eastern mountains of Tora Bora, which may be Mr. bin Laden's final refuge. 

A CAVE IN SIGHT -- "Al Qaeda is finished," Commander Hazarat Ali, the ranking Afghan military officer, proclaimed. "They are surrounded." After a week of heavy American bombing, sporadic ground fighting and walkie-talkie attempts to negotiate a surrender, the war's last big battle appeared to be nearing a climax, and what could be Mr. bin Laden's last redoubt seemed in sight. "There is one specific cave," Commander Ali declared. "We can see it. We are trying to reach it."
American officials were more cautious. Pentagon spokesmen said they believed Mr. bin Laden was still somewhere in the Agam and Wazir Valleys of Tora Bora, but the Pakistan-based Afghan Islamic Press, quoting unnamed sources, said the world's most wanted man slipped into Pakistan in late November. President Bush said it hardly mattered, that Mr. bin Laden would be captured, sooner or later, dead or alive.

VIDEOTAPE FALLOUT -- Reaction to the videotape of Mr. bin Laden gloating over the terrorist attacks that killed more than 3,000 people continued to pour in. The United States and its allies see the tape as damning evidence: on it, Mr. bin Laden admits to knowing about the attacks in advance and even speaks of calculating casualties. Prosecutors said it could be decisive in court, if Mr. bin Laden were brought to trial. But defense lawyers said there were ways to undercut its value.
Having seen the tape, some prominent Muslims in the United States who had been skeptical of the accusations against Mr. bin Laden are now persuaded of his guilt. But many ordinary Muslims in America and around the world dismissed the tape as a fake, and many Muslim states reacted cautiously, or not at all, mindful of restive Islamic public opinion. Investigators, meantime, note that Mr. bin Laden did not mention anthrax, and are mulling over what that means.

MARINES SECURE AIRPORT -- Hundreds of United States marines occupied the Kandahar airport in southern Afghanistan, some landing by helicopter and others arriving in a convoy. They met no armed resistance, but moved cautiously, checking for booby traps, land mines and unexploded bombs. The airport, fixed up, is to become a major arrival point for humanitarian aid that will be desperately needed this winter.
The marines had come from Camp Rhino, their base southwest of Kandahar, and were expected to move many operations to the airport. But the rear-guard camp may serve another purpose soon. A prison being constructed there is expected to hold many Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners. Two weeks ago, the Bush administration appeared to be interested only in the enemy's top leaders, but officials now see intelligence possibilities in the captured rank-and-file fighters.
In Kandahar, new details emerged of the fighting that led to the Taliban's defeat there a week ago. They suggest a strange picture of incongruous allies -- Afghan warlords whose hatreds turned some encounters with the enemy into summary executions, and the American commandos who contributed lavish technology and awesome ordinance.
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld flew off to Azerbaijan, Armenia and Georgia for talks on the war. Those former Soviet republics have offered the use of their airspace for American military action. Attorney General John Ashcroft was in Rome on his European tour seeking support for the extradition of terrorist suspects facing the death penalty. He had no success in Britain, Spain or Germany. Italy, which outlawed capital punishment in 1948, is not likely to go along either.
In Washington, where Congressional negotiators were trying to reconcile differences over an economic stimulus plan, New York lawmakers were mounting a bipartisan effort to get the $9.5 billion the Senate approved last week to help New York City recover from the Sept. 11 attacks. House Republicans put in only $7 billion, despite New York jeers that it was too little.

HEADLINE: HOLLYWOOD'S NEW FORCE: THE REGULATORS; 
State Attorneys General Taking Steps to Block Satellite TV Acquisition

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER 8. LEE 

 BODY:
Even as Vivendi announced its plans to take a stake in EchoStar, some state attorneys general said yesterday that they were preparing efforts to block EchoStar's purchase of a rival and take control of 90 percent of the satellite TV industry. 
 Their concerns reflected those of some members of Congress, particularly from rural areas, who have warned that EchoStar's plan to buy Hughes Electronics could result in a monopoly in many areas of the country. Together EchoStar and Hughes's DirecTV satellite unit control more than 90 percent of the satellite TV market. 
 "We're very close to taking action," said Richard Blumenthal, the attorney general of Connecticut. "There are strong and serious grounds for opposing this deal because very clearly it will have anticompetitive and anti-consumer effects." He estimated that "5 to 10 states at a minimum" would participate in any legal effort. 
Charles Ergen, the chief executive of EchoStar, has said that the merger is necessary to allow satellite television to compete with cable TV. He has also argued that a merged company would make more local channels available to consumers, eliminating redundant broadcasting on the limited satellite bandwidth. He has also promised a national price plan, so that rural residents would benefit from prices that result from urban competition with cable.
Vivendi's chairman, Jean-Marie Messier, has said that the investment is worthwhile regardless of the outcome of the merger. But if the merger is approved, Vivendi would obtain a distribution network reaching more than 16.7 million subscribers, the largest pay TV service in the nation. 
Shortly after EchoStar agreed to buy Hughes for $26 billion in late October, offices of state attorneys generals began regular conference calls to discuss it, with about 20 states regularly participating and sometimes more than 30 states calling in, participants said.
The attorneys general have formed a working group to interview experts, read documents and explore legal theories.
Most of the public attention on the debate has focused on Washington, where the Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission have regulatory authority over the merger. Last Tuesday, the House of Representatives held two hearings on the merger. 
But the states may prove to be a more difficult battleground, and opponents are already working to be heard. Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, which had also bid for DirecTV, has distributed an "Essential Guide" to the merger, an inch-thick book that details the economic and legal issues. News Corporation has also retained Robert Abrams, the former attorney general of New York, to lobby against the deal on the state level, while the National Rural Telecommunications Cooperative has reportedly retained Jeffrey A. Modisett, the former attorney general of Indiana. 
While a number of state attorneys general express concern privately over the merger, they take care to to note that the review process is still in its early stages. The approval process could take up to a year, and many states have just begun to examine the issue.
A few states, however, have been outspoken from the beginning. In late November, the attorney general of Missouri, Jay Nixon, sent a three-page letter to the Department of Justice outlining his opposition. The merger would leave Missouri residents who are not wired for cable, about one-third of the state, under a satellite television monopoly, he said. "I disagree that this monopoly would increase competition," Mr. Nixon said. "I think it would obviously end the competition between these two companies."
In Washington, members of the House of Representatives are also circulating a letter asking the Department of Justice and the F.C.C. to "rigorously scrutinize this proposed merger to ensure that rural consumers do not suffer the consequences of higher prices, fewer choices and reduced services." The letter has gained bipartisan support, with more than 60 representatives from rural and urban areas signing it. The leaders of the rural caucus expect to have at least 80 signatures before they send it next week. Representatives from EchoStar and Hughes have requested a meeting before the letter is sent. 
Congress has no direct role in the regulatory approval process. But state attorneys general do have the power to block mergers by filing lawsuits grounded in both state and federal antitrust laws.
The state attorneys general have become a feisty political force in the last few years, taking legal action against tobacco companies and Microsoft. Many of the attorneys general seem willing to march down their own path, independent of the new Justice Department administration.
"This is ramping up as if it will be a significant and serious effort on behalf of a number of states," Mr. Nixon said.
For all the opponents of the EchoStar deal, there have been some politicians who have enthusiastically endorsed it. Representative Rick Boucher, a Virginia Democrat who represents a mostly rural district, says that his constituents would benefit from a single satellite television company.
A combined entity would be more efficient, allowing his constituents to receive their local television channels, which are currently not available on satellite. In addition, it could bring high-speed satellite Internet access at a lower price. "It would be an enormous benefit," Mr. Boucher said.
EchoStar has a service center in his district, but Boucher said he did not know whether it would benefit from the merger.

HEADLINE: Lawmakers Slip Farther Apart On Economic Recovery Deal 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 1 

 BODY:
Talks in Congress over an economic recovery package stalled today after the chief Republican negotiator asked for more sweeping income tax cuts than the Bush administration is seeking.
 Participants in the talks said the negotiator, Representative Bill Thomas of California, who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, sought to persuade Democrats to speed up planned reductions in income tax rates for upper-income brackets as well as for middle-income people. 
 President Bush had proposed this week that the income tax cuts be limited to accelerating a planned reduction in the current 27 percent rate to 25 percent, a change that would apply to individuals with taxable income starting at $27,950 and couples starting at $46,700. 
Mr. Thomas also continued to press for a full repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax, participants in the meeting said, even though the White House and Senate Republicans have already signaled they are willing to compromise on the issue.
Senator Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said Mr. Thomas's proposals moved the talks backward.
"They're asking for full A.M.T. repeal and significant acceleration of the rate cuts, which I think is too much," Mr. Baucus said in an interview, referring to the alternative minimum tax. He added that the two parties remained far apart over how to provide laid-off workers with help buying health insurance coverage.
"There's been a lot of talk but no real movement," Mr. Baucus said.
After optimism on both sides this week that an agreement was in sight, the negotiations have made almost no progress in the last few days. If there is no deal by the middle of next week, Congress will most likely go home for Christmas without taking action to help bring about a recovery from the first recession in a decade.
To try to break the logjam, Mr. Baucus, who is his party's main negotiator, and Mr. Thomas scheduled a one-on-one meeting for Saturday morning. 
In an effort to put pressure on the negotiations, House Republican leaders have scheduled a vote for Tuesday on a compromise proposal that is also supported by a handful of moderate and conservative Democrats in the Senate. Democrats said the strategy was nothing more than an effort by Republicans to give themselves political cover should the negotiations fail.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE FEDERAL AID; 
State's Leaders Are Together In Fight for $9.5 Billion Deal

BYLINE:  By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 14 

 BODY:
New York lawmakers are mounting a bipartisan effort to ensure that New York gets at least the $9.5 billion that the Senate approved last week to help the city recover from the Sept. 11 attack, an amount that is by no means assured.
 Democrats included that money in a $317.5 billion defense appropriation bill that the Senate approved last week. But House Republicans provided only $7 billion for New York in a similar defense appropriations bill they approved, despite complaints from New York lawmakers that that was not nearly enough. 
 Now, negotiators for the House and the Senate are trying to reconcile that and other differences between the competing defense bills. That, in turn, has prompted a vigorous lobbying campaign by New York lawmakers, who say they face a tough fight. 
This week, Representative John E. Sweeney, a Republican from upstate New York, sent a letter to his House colleagues urging them to provide the entire $9.5 billion for New York. But in an interview, he conceded that New York might not get that much. Even Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican who has kept a low profile in the battle, is urging Congress to accept the $9.5 billion figure.
In a letter he sent to Capitol Hill lawmakers Thursday, Mr. Pataki recalled the people who died in the attack on the World Trade Center, as well as the damage it did to the city and state economies.
The fight for New York money is being waged on yet another front. Democratic leaders in the Senate advanced a national economic stimulus plan that included $5 billion worth of tax credits and other incentives to encourage businesses to stay in Lower Manhattan. The package was sponsored by New York's two Democratic senators, Charles E. Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton.
House Republicans did not include such a package for New York in the national economic stimulus plan approved by that chamber. But Thursday, the House did approve $6.1 billion in tax breaks to help New York City recover from the attacks, along with a measure that would free the estates of victims from any income tax liability for this year and last year.
The House measure -- which would create a new economic development zone, called a Liberty Zone, in Lower Manhattan -- had been strongly supported by a bipartisan group of New Yorkers in the House, as well as by Mr. Pataki.
Now, New York lawmakers are trying to convince House and Senate negotiators to include some sort of economic recovery package for Lower Manhattan in whatever compromise they reach on a stimulus plan for the national economy.
The lobbying comes just days after Republicans defeated a Democratic effort to add $17 billion for New York to the defense appropriations bill. The additional money was added at the request of Mr. Schumer and Mrs. Clinton.
In the end, Democrats accepted a smaller figure for New York -- the $9.5 billion. That was seen as a victory for Mr. Bush, who had opposed the $17 billion proposal. Mrs. Clinton conceded that she and her New York colleagues faced an uphill battle in getting the entire $9.5 billion for New York as the House and the Senate head into negotiations. Mr. Schumer echoed that sentiment. But he noted that at the very least, the showdown over the $17 billion prompted Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska, the ranking Republican on the Appropriations Committee, to promise to seek more money for New York as early as January.
Many New York lawmakers are worried that Republicans will put off the question of giving New York additional aid until the shock of Sept. 11 might have faded and, along with it, national sympathy for New York. "There is still a great deal of good will toward New York," Mr. Schumer said, in arguing for getting additional money sooner rather than later.

HEADLINE: South Korea Sees Prospects Of Its Leader Steadily Ebb 

BYLINE:  By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Dec. 12 

 BODY:
One by one in recent weeks presidential candidates have been emerging like hibernating bugs from Korea's political woodwork, first in the opposition parties, and then in the ruling party of President Kim Dae Jung himself.
 Few democratic countries have had more imperial presidencies than this one. So across the spectrum, with elections still a full year away, the sudden crowd of hopefuls is inevitably being seen as a signal of the end of Mr. Kim's once formidable powers. 
 "The president's popularity is way down and his party has lost major elections three times in a row," said Park Shin Il, an official of the opposition Grand National Party, who was fairly clucking. "Most importantly, his favorite dream of all, his sunshine policy toward North Korea, is totally stalemated. Even people in his own party are calling Kim Dae Jung a lame duck."
Even if the 77-year-old Mr. Kim's political allies are not willing to completely write him off yet, for many who follow this country's rough and tumble politics, the president's stunning descent, to 25 percent approval ratings and scarcely veiled challenges within his own party, has been a breathtaking thing to watch. 
Just one year ago this week, Mr. Kim was being toasted by the Nobel Committee in Sweden as its latest peace prize laureate.
At home and abroad, having unexpectedly pulled off a reconciliation with his country's cold war enemy, North Korea, Mr. Kim had the aura of a political miracle worker.
Critics and admirers alike say, though, that what has happened in the last year is an object lesson for future leaders of this nation of 46 million about the limits of influence in a region where far larger and more powerful nations have always called the tunes. 
For many indeed, Mr. Kim's successes with North Korea, including the historic summit in Pyongyang in June 2000, represent the beginning of the end for the South Korean leader. Critics say that Mr. Kim seemed so determined to reconcile with his Communist neighbor that he neglected other vital aspects of governance like mushrooming official corruption and a sputtering economy.
Then, even his diplomacy ran aground, falling badly out of synch with the new Bush administration, whose suspicion of the North went undisguised during a visit by Mr. Kim to Washington in March and effectively knocked the supports out from under his policy.
Resurgent hostility from the North was soon to follow, leaving Mr. Kim suddenly with few laurels to lean on.
"When President Kim went to the United States -- standing right next to him at a press conference -- George Bush said he was skeptical toward North Korea," said Yong Soon Yim, a political scientist who is dean of the Sungkyunkwan University graduate school in Seoul. 
"It almost sounded like a rebuke. Already with the economy going bad here, people had begun to ask, 'Why should we be helping North Korea so much when we are suffering?' " The reception gave fuel to Mr. Kim's political enemies at home. 
The Sept. 11 terror attacks managed to strip Mr. Kim of any remaining momentum for his policy once provided. The Bush administration's posture toward the North grew even tougher as it warned that the United States would not only go after terrorists but also the states that sponsored them, something Washington has long accused North Korea of doing. 
Rather than assisting Mr. Kim as he began to experience troubles at home, North Korea has exhibited the kind of bad timing and political tone-deafness for which it is famous. Pyongyang has recently stepped up the volume of its criticisms of the South, launching into vituperative attacks on the United States as well.
The low point came late last month when the two countries exchanged automatic weapons fire across the border for the first time since 1998. 
Another ace in the hole for Mr. Kim has been the country's burgeoning civic groups, which once strongly supported the president because of his credentials in the democracy and human rights movement that date to his long years as a persecuted dissident. 
The civic movement has turned decidedly lukewarm, however, blaming the president for not pushing his economic reforms vigorously enough. 
"Ordinary people can't feel any benefits from his economic programs," said Lee Tae Ho, chief coordinator of People's Solidarity for Participatory Democracy, a leading civic group. "Support for Kim has waned because it seemed like he wasn't interested in reform anymore." 
Mr. Kim had set out to break up many of Korea's giagantic industrial conglomerates and to open the economy to independent entrepreneurs. But since the middle of his term, after an economic crisis swept through Asia, he backed off many of his promises. In recent weeks, however, the ecnonomy has begun to pick up again, and so have grass-roots calls for reform.
Yet for all of the gloom surrounding the remainder of Mr. Kim's term, there are still those who warn that writing off a man who has survived for so long, combining extraordinary willpower, wile and courage would be foolish. For one thing, they say, the engagement with North Korea remains a major historical achievement.
"The North has destroyed Kim Dae Jung's diplomatic credibility by failing to show him even a minimum of respect lately, but it would be quite inaccurate still to call the sunshine policy a failure," said Ralph A. Cossa, the president of Pacific Forum, a Hawaii-based Asian affairs research group. "People will look back at this as a tremendous accomplishment, even if it didn't live up to expectations."
Associates of the president say, however, that while he is not giving up completely on North Korean diplomacy, his eyes are already focused on a more immediate goal: defying his critics by helping his Millennium Democratic Party pull off a surprise victory in next December's presidential election.
"It no longer matters whether Kim Jong Il comes here to visit at this point,"one presidential aide said, referring to the North Korean leader. "The focus is one thing now -- the elections. And if the economy keeps improving the way it has been, our president believes his party can win."

HEADLINE: HOLLYWOOD'S NEW FORCE: THE PLAYER; 
If Diller Did Comment on This, He Might Say, 'Rosebud'

BYLINE:  By BERNARD WEINRAUB 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 14 

 BODY:
Barry Diller's favorite movie is "Citizen Kane," in which Orson Welles plays a brilliant, restless and enigmatic media mogul.
 The same adjectives describe Mr. Diller, who is now in final negotiations to achieve his longstanding goal of becoming one of the handful of powers -- like Rupert Murdoch, his former boss, and Michael D. Eisner, his former employee -- who dominate the entertainment landscape. 
 Although Mr. Diller and Vivendi Universal are still dickering over the details, the 60-year-old multimillionaire is expected to become chief of the company's Hollywood businesses, running Universal's film and television operations. 
In the process, he would cement his control over USA Networks Inc., the company he cobbled together while waiting in Hollywood's wings. USA Networks would contribute its cable channels and television studio to Universal, leaving USA with a variety of Internet properties, Ticketmaster and the biggest home shopping networks.
The deal is expected to be announced as soon as Monday.
Mr. Diller quit the chairmanship of Fox Inc. nearly 10 years ago because he no longer wanted to work for Mr. Murdoch, the owner -- or anyone else, for that matter. So his willingness to consider working for Jean-Marie Messier, Vivendi's ambitious chief executive, puzzled even Mr. Diller's friends, especially given his insistence to more than one in recent days that "I would never give up my independence for anything."
The explanation, perhaps reflecting the ambiguity in which Mr. Diller thrives, is that the deal he is on the verge of reaching with Mr. Messier lets him have it both ways. 
He will continue to be his own boss at whatever USA Networks' rump properties are renamed -- and, in fact, will give that business the majority of his time, according to friends who have discussed this with him. In addition, he will be firmly in control of Mr. Messier's much larger Universal operations.
"It's a win-win for Barry," said a longtime friend. "He'll have his own assets, he'll do things in his own way. And he'll have this arrangement where he runs Universal as long as he's comfortable. And if he's not comfortable, he'll pick up his marbles and leave anytime."
That Mr. Messier would even consider such an arrangement appears to show the trust he has developed working with Mr. Diller over the last year. As the 43 percent owner of USA Networks, Vivendi s already in business with Mr. Diller -- a result of an earlier deal that reflects Mr. Diller's financial shrewdness (some say cunning).
Mr. Diller may now sell to Mr. Messier the same television assets that USA Networks bought four years ago, for $4.1 billion, from Seagram, the company that Mr. Messier bought last year to get Vivendi into the media business. 
In exchange, Edgar Bronfman Jr., who was running Seagram, got the 43 percent stake in USA. And Mr. Bronfman got Mr. Diller to run his television business, as Mr. Messier hopes to now.
The deal would add to Mr. Diller's already substantial wealth; if Vivendi, as expected, pays $10 billion or so for the USA holdings -- more than twice what they cost Mr. Diller -- his 7 percent stake in the company would reap him $700 million. 
And he would be reaping it during an economic slump in the television business.
"The business of owning a general-entertainment cable network has gotten worse and worse," one top television network executive said. "He's walking into a price that's good for him."
Besides money, Mr. Diller -- who has never lost his cachet on Wall Street or the New York and Los Angeles social scenes -- would be assuming the kind of prominent job that would again make him a dominant figure in show business. He would at least regain the stature he had when he ran Paramount and then Fox, if not the standing he sought in making failed bids in the 1990's for control of Paramount, CBS and NBC.
"Barry's been marginalized," said a longtime friend in the film business. His USA holdings "all seemed so amorphous, like odds and ends," the friend said. "This gives him a clear focus. It's movies, television, theme parks, the Internet." Running Universal, this person said, "he's now one of the five or so most powerful guys in this world here -- that hasn't escaped him."
Diane Von Furstenberg, who married Mr. Diller in February after 27 years of friendship, said today: "What drives Barry is to realize his vision. I don't think it was ever just about money. Money was the consequence. Barry has a vision, and he likes to make things happen. That's what he does. That's what drives him."
But Mr. Diller has always seemed to have a problem with authority. When he joined Fox in 1984, he had a clause in his contract that he would speak to the owner, then Marvin Davis, twice a year, according to Mr. Diller's former associates.
On a personal level, Mr. Diller can be at turns charming and abrasive. He has a temper.
One of the most famous stories about him -- one he has never denied -- is that in the mid-1980's, in a fit of rage, he hurled a videocassette at an associate, Stephen Chao. It went right through the wall. Mr. Chao, who until recently remained a Diller deputy at USA Networks, had that section of the wall framed.
"Barry nails you if you don't know your stuff," said a film producer who has worked with Mr. Diller at Paramount and Fox. "He goes after weak spots; he doesn't let you get away with anything." Still, this person said: "He actually prefers when you don't agree with him. And he's only intimidating if you're intimidated by him."
A college drop-out, Mr. Diller, at 25, became the youngest vice president of programming ever at ABC. He invented the "Movie of the Week" and the "novel for television," the latter of which turned into the mini-series.
In 1974, at the age of 32, he was the head of Paramount, where he employed a group of young executives like Mr. Eisner, now the chairman of the Walt Disney Company, and Jeffrey Katzenberg, now a partner at DreamWorks. Under his lead, the lackluster Paramount studio was revived with hits like "Raiders of the Lost Ark" and "Saturday Night Fever."
Ten years later, Mr. Diller jumped to Fox, where he started the Fox television network and programmed shows like "The Simpsons," "Married . . . With Children" and "Beverly Hills, 90210."
After leaving Fox in 1992, because he wanted to control his own company rather than work for Mr. Murdoch, Mr. Diller bought a 13-seat Gulfstream jet and an Apple PowerBook laptop computer, and traveled around the country considering his next move. 
In 1995, he took control of the Home Shopping Network. In 1998, he bought USA Networks, whose USA and Sci-Fi cable channels became the centerpieces of his company. 
Over the next five years, he added a grab bag of assets including Ticketmaster, a number of UHF television stations, Web ventures like the Internet Shopping Network, a production company called Studios USA and the Hotel Reservations Network.
In the process, Mr. Diller built his company's market capitalization from $250 million to $17.58 billion.

HEADLINE: HOLLYWOOD'S NEW FORCE: THE STRATEGY; 
'01 Media Model: Content and Distribution Go Together

BYLINE:  By AMY HARMON 

 BODY:
Ever since Jean-Marie Messier began aspiring to turn Vivendi Universal from a French water company into a global media conglomerate, critics have said its weakness was a lack of control over the distribution of its entertainment products. 
 After all, Vivendi's main competitors -- AOL Time Warner and Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation -- combined content and distribution, and experts said they represented the smart paradigm. Mr. Messier's deal-making this week finally gives him distribution, through the EchoStar Communications and DirecTV satellite systems, and lets him poke Mr. Murdoch in the eye as well, since the News Corporation had hoped to win control of DirecTV itself. DirecTV is owned by General Motors. 
 There are fewer and fewer dissenters from this business model, despite some failures in the last decade when media companies sought to merge with phone companies and then became infatuated with the Internet as a new means of delivery. 
Now media analysts and executives are convinced that the most efficient business plan is to own as many outlets as possible to deliver the movies, television, music and books that they themselves produce. 
The pursuit of that goal has been hindered in the past not only by misguided visions of the future but also by government action that sought to limit the control entertainment producers could have over the distribution of their material. But government regulators in recent years have been far more lenient on that front.
As a result, the media winners of the coming decade will be the ones that best combine multiple means of distribution with many forms of entertainment production.
"There's always that potential threat that your own productions will not see the best positioning on a competitor's distribution system," said Harold Vogel, a media analyst and author of Entertainment Industry Economics. "If you have your own distribution assured then you can use that as leverage against anybody that would dare to deny you access."
It is a model that traces its roots to the dawn of the movie industry in the 1920's and 1930's, when the studios consolidated control over the theaters where their films would be shown. Those combinations were dissolved by a 1948 consent decree by the government. 
Similarly, in the late 1960's, the Federal Communications Commission inaugurated rules that prevented television networks from owning the programs they broadcast. Those rules were dropped in 1995, paving the way for deals that included the mergers of Disney and ABC; Viacom and Paramount Studios; and later, Viacom and CBS.
AOL's merger last year with Time Warner was also based on the logic of combining content with distribution -- albeit a different kind of distribution called the Internet. For its part, the News Corporation has purchased satellite companies in Europe and Asia in pursuit of a global system to deliver its own products. 
Still, the question remains whether the marriage of content with ownership of cable or satellite systems is the best mix. At least one media giant, Disney, contends that content is most valuable when it can be shopped to a variety of distributors. 
"For us, the main product is intellectual product, or content," Disney's chairman, Michael D. Eisner, said in an interview last summer. "And it is our single driver."
And some media paradigms seem to have a half-life of only a few years. After cable distribution companies like Viacom and Time Warner scooped up programmers like MTV and Turner Broadcasting, conventional wisdom held that the next step was for the cable companies to merge with phone companies. That way, they could deliver interactive services to consumers over whichever wire into their home best suited their needs.
But those deals fell apart, largely over an inability to merge technologies and corporate cultures. Similar issues may plague the media giants as they seek to merge more production and distribution today.
"For every business there is a natural size and the natural-size unit in movie and television production is fairly small," Mr. Vogel said. "But distribution requires much larger-size units to be effective. If there's too much bureaucracy injected into the whole structure, whether distribution or content production, then it becomes less efficient and you start to lose creative people."
Still, for the moment, the argument is not over whether bigger is better but which kind of bigger is best. AOL Time Warner, for instance, clearly has an edge in Internet distribution, while Viacom has solid cable holdings. The News Corporation is seen as needing to plug a gap in its satellite distribution network in the United States. Disney's Internet ventures foundered, but the firm has strong properties in ESPN and its film library.
Vivendi, everyone agrees, needs a television network partner, and may get one soon if its negotiations with USA Networks bear fruit.
"Vivendi simply wants to be more like AOL Time Warner and Viacom CBS and Disney ABC," said Paul Sagan, a media analyst with Paul Kagan Associates. "That's the model, and that model is working."

Barry Diller, right, has wanted to widen his own horizons and may have found a way if he and Vivendi can reach a deal. (Reuters); (Chester Higgins Jr./The New York Times) Chart: "Reshaping a Media Giant"Vivendi Universal, in a series of deals, is attempting to put its television and film production and distribution businesses on an equal footing with other media giants like AOL Time Warner and Viacom. Here is a look at its deals with EchoStar (completed), and USA Networks (still pending). Gaining access to television subscribersFor its investment in EchoStar, a satellite-to-home broadcaster, Vivendi would get five channels.

HEADLINE: THE CLOSE READER; 
Expecting the Worst

BYLINE:  By Judith Shulevitz 

 BODY:
EVER since Americans began fighting wars, they have mostly done so in the name of ideals -- freedom, democracy, human rights. The war in Afghanistan is no exception. Once the press conferences are over, however, relatively few of the people who decide when and where to wage war actually think of themselves as idealists. The term preferred by members of the American foreign policy establishment is "realism," which in this context has a very precise meaning.
 Realists, who hold many of the best jobs in our graduate departments of international relations, foreign policy think tanks and world-affairs commentariat, are a knit-browed bunch. They see reality as a condition of uncorrectable anarchy, particularly the reality of international politics, and one to which the proper response is sternness. Hence the expression Realpolitik, used to describe the kind of statecraft Henry Kissinger made famous, in which considerations of power and security take precedence over moral concerns. 
 To quote Hobbes (and everyone who starts talking about realism does), life for people in the state of nature is "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short," and life for states is similarly dubious, spent in the throes of "continuall jealousies, and in the state and posture of Gladiators; having their weapons pointing, and their eyes fixed on one another; that is, their Forts, Garrisons and Guns upon the Frontiers of their Kingdomes; and continuall Spyes upon their neighbours; which is a posture of War."
If Hobbes's imagery suggests the landscape of an Elizabethan tragedy, you've grasped the guiding spirit of political realism. An aura of doom hangs over realist policy analysis, though few academic realists call themselves "tragic realists." That popular formulation is journalistic, used notably by the foreign correspondent Robert D. Kaplan, whose account of the Bosnian conflict as rooted in ancient tribal hatreds was said to have caused Bill Clinton to stall for years before getting involved in the Balkans.
Though Hobbes gives tragic realism its tone and Kaplan its epithet, foreign policy pessimism goes back to Thucydides, the great Greek historian of the Peloponnesian War. In one often quoted sentence, he implied an origin of that war that realists have expanded into a universal theory of belligerence. "What made war inevitable," he wrote, "was the growth of Athenian power and the fear which this caused in Sparta." In other words, an imbalance of power between states triggered the struggle of all against all that lurks beneath the surface of seemingly civilized relations.
Realists agree on their disdain for woolly-headed idealism (which they also call "moralism" and "utopianism") but not on much else. In the millenniums since Thucydides, writers as diverse as Machiavelli and Rousseau have contributed to the canon, but realism has finally thickened into two main flavors, historical and scientific. Historical-minded realists generally come from outside the discipline of political science; their conservatism stems at least as much from temperament as from a systematic assessment of the data. They are historians like Thucydides or Gibbon, worldly diplomats like George F. Kennan or, in one notable case, a theologian. Reinhold Niebuhr, the American Protestant thinker, believed that even the religious outlook required a certain -- though not excessive -- amount of cautionary pessimism. Realists of this sort see multiple reasons for hostilities: the distribution of power, domestic politics, ideology, national traits, leaders' personalities. They think wars are inevitable, but they tend to hold out some hope that by promoting democracy or wiping out poverty abroad, international violence can be averted.
Scientific realists, on the other hand, emphasize a single cause: the zero-sum game that is international politics. They think in terms of systems and structures, rather than personalities, and they downplay internal politics in favor of a vision of the world as a chess game in which the question of whether one's knight is made of marble or wood is irrelevant. They doubt that governments can do much to cure the social diseases said to lead to war, and have a strong predisposition to stay out of foreign conflicts.
Eight years ago, Samuel P. Huntington, a scholar of international relations, advanced a theory that falls somewhere between scientific and historical realism. Huntington's ideas have gained enormous currency in the past few months, if only because they appear to have come true. Huntington is monocausal, but his prime mover is not politics but culture. In "The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order," he identified several great cultures (he calls them civilizations) bound to compete for power now that Communism and fascism -- the great ideologies -- have come to an end. (He doesn't see much future for liberalism, either.) Among those civilizations are the Chinese, the Hindu or Indian, Islam and the West. The most volatile, he predicted, would be Islam. His prescription: to renew a strong and proud Western identity at home and eschew a false universalism abroad.
In some ways his advice is unexceptionable. Indeed, it even has a strong moral appeal, since in making our characters our destinies Huntington appears to avoid the paralyzing effects of thinking in terms of vast, impersonal constellations of power. Yet like many of his fellow realists, Huntington reveals a strong strain of fatalism. He turns culture -- the record and embodiment of human innovativeness -- into something surprisingly fixed and eternal. Theorists of interconnectedness, who rank high among the realists' intellectual opponents, think Huntington and others gravely underestimate the ability of the global economy to reshape cultures and nations from within.
It's salutary to grapple with realism, since it forces us to think in hardheaded ways about how far we'd go to keep ourselves safe. But at the same time we run the risk of slighting our own knack -- and that of our adversaries -- for trust, cooperation and growth. Like Greek tragic drama, in which it is partly grounded, realism has a way of seeing the world as so intractable and human options as so narrow that we can no longer be held responsible for our own fates.
Half a century ago, the philosopher Isaiah Berlin dismissed theories of what he called "historical inevitability" for that reason. He believed that their disregard for human freedom gave them the power to wreak a great deal of havoc. Deterministic models of behavior, he said, were like "djinns," which "once set free from the jars in which they have been confined for centuries, become uncontrollable, and capriciously play with the lives of men and nations." His warning seems as apt as ever. We wouldn't want Hobbes's gloomy, garrisoned frontier to become the farthest reach of our aspirations.

 BODY:
 THE CHRISTMAS PROMISE. By Susan Bartoletti. Illustrated by David Christiana. Blue Sky/Scholastic. $15.95. (Ages 5 to 9) This wistful story tells of a young girl and her unemployed father, who are on the road as hobos during the Great Depression. They do find a warm, safe place for the child to stay at Christmas. The endpapers include the hobo signage indicating places where there is danger or a jail, a place to camp or a kind lady.

CHRISTMAS SOUL: African American Holiday Stories. As told to Allison Samuels. Illustrated by Michele Wood. Jump at the Sun/Hyperion. $17.99. (All ages) A charmingly illustrated collection of holiday memories of popular celebrities ranging from Debbie Allen and Halle Berry to Aretha Franklin, LL Cool J and Patti LaBelle. Shaquille O'Neal tells about receiving the Stretch Armstrong doll he loved, and spending the whole special day with his father.

PINOCCHIO: A Classic Illustrated Edition. By Carlo Collodi. Compiled by Cooper Edens. Chronicle. $19.95. (Ages 5 and up) This publication of the familiar, and always startling, story of Geppetto the carpenter and the adventures of the wooden boy he carved uses most of the original 1892 English-language translation. As with other titles in this series, including "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" and "Peter Pan," the illustrations come from more than two dozen other editions -- including here the splendid familiar one by Attilio Mussino. As great as the movie version is, Jiminy Cricket and all, it is well worth reading these short, surprising chapters aloud.

A CHRISTMAS TREASURY: Very Merry Stories and Poems. Illustrated by Kevin Hawkes. HarperCollins. $16.95. (All ages) Here's a basic collection for fireside reading, which includes excerpts from "The Wind in the Willows," "A Visit From St. Nicholas," "Christmas at the Hollow Tree Inn," by Albert Bigelow Paine, and two carols, "Jolly Old St. Nicholas" and "The Friendly Beasts," all exuberantly illustrated.

ROVER SAVES CHRISTMAS. By Roddy Doyle. Illustrated by Brian Ajhar. Arthur A. Levine/Scholastic. $14.95. (Ages 5 and up) Remember Rover from "The Giggler Treatment"? Well, he's back, because one Christmas Eve up in Lapland, Rudolph got the flu and Santa realized that Rover, back in Dublin, is the one to help. It's another loopy, very Irish, adventure set in Lapland, Dublin and Lagos (by the author of "Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha"), with wordplay, bad jokes and even commercials for toothpaste.

THE PAPER DOORWAY: Funny Verse and Nothing Worse. By Dean Koontz. Illustrated by Phil Parks. HarperCollins. $17.95. (Ages 8 to 12) A cheerful collection of light verse from a writer more associated with scary adult fiction. The topics range from "The Monstrous Broccoli Excuse" to "An Interesting Fact About Dogs." The black-and-white illustrations are extremely funny, and each one, the author and illustrator claim, contains a mouse somewhere.

TABLE MANNERS: The Edifying Story of Two Friends Whose Discovery of Good Manners Promises Them a Glorious Future. By Vladimir Radunsky. Illustrated by Chris Raschka. Candlewick. $16.99. (Ages 5 and up) A hilarious illustrated conversation on the topic, between the author, known as Dudunya, and the illustrator, called Chester. It is perhaps better suited to teenagers or college students than to children, who really haven't got a grasp of table manners.

One by one, the defendants file into the large steel cage. There are 10 of them, young men in their mid-20's. Some wear jeans and sweatshirts -- and defiant expressions. Others appear bruised and frightened.
 Soldiers in desert camouflage fatigues and black jackboots ring the cage, which runs along one wall of the Akmal Ikramov District Court. Outside, sheep graze next to Tashkent Police Station No. 2, and anxious relatives mill around a fountain, waiting for the courthouse to open its doors. 
 Today is the last day of hearings, and the verdicts will be handed down. The mothers, grandmothers, sisters and wives of the accused murmur prayers and recite verses from the Koran, though many of them know that praying won't save their sons and husbands. 
Judge Rustamov Nizam is presiding, and in these parts of Central Asia he has a reputation for dispensing swift justice. He sits at a raised plastic-laminate table, beneath the blue, white and green seal of Uzbekistan with its crescent and stars, looking supremely self-confident -- as if he has the power over life and death, which he does. 
"Silence," he commands, and a hush falls over the courtroom. This afternoon, the 10 defendants will get their only chance to say their piece, to beg the court's forgiveness and to ask for clemency -- not that it's likely to be forthcoming. They all stand accused under Article 159 of the criminal code of undermining the constitution. But their real crime is religious fanaticism, of wanting an Islamic state. It's a serious offense in this former Soviet cotton colony, where the government of the onetime Communist Party boss, Islam Karimov, has ruled with an iron fist since the days when the Red Army used Uzbek bases to occupy neighboring Afghanistan. Today, thanks to a three-year crackdown following a terror attack, leaders of the Islamic opposition are all either in jail or in exile.
In many respects, President Karimov is no different from the region's other strongmen, whose abysmal human rights records and bizarre notions of democracy appear to have been inspired more by Genghis Khan than by George Washington. But Uzbekistan is America's newest ally in the war against terror, and any rumblings in the State Department over Karimov's heavy-handed ways have been silenced since the Uzbek leader allowed American troops to use his desert nation as a beachhead for their assault on Afghanistan. The trade-off -- for a regime that was frequently snubbed by the Clinton administration -- is political legitimacy. In exchange for that precious commodity, Karimov granted access to a key air base in Khanabad, a few hundred miles north of the Afghan border, where more than 1,000 special light infantry rangers were immediately deployed. Until last week, his generosity had not extended to the "Bridge of Friendship," the main link with Afghanistan, which had remained closed to all traffic -- including essential food shipments. 
But Uzbekistan, meanwhile, is free to continue its decadelong policy of persecuting anyone perceived as a threat to Karimov's authority. It just so happens that with all political dissent crushed, the targets of the current crackdown are about the only people left in the country who don't see eye to eye with the president: militant Muslims. That, of course, makes it a whole lot easier for Washington to look the other way. 
"The accused Aliev will rise," Judge Nizam says. Mohamed Aliev stands in the steel cage. He is a slim young man, with shorn dark hair and a blue Adidas T-shirt. "We are charged because of our beliefs," he begins. "Because we are part of Hizb-ut-Tahrir. But we are not against the constitutional order."
The judge interrupts him impatiently: "You are confessing guilt but saying you're not guilty." Aliev doesn't know it, because like most of the other defendants he is not represented by legal counsel, but simply admitting membership in Hizb-ut-Tahrir is tantamount to treason in Uzbekistan, as the fundamentalist Islamic movement seeks to replace the secular state with the Caliphate, or religious rule.
"I demand that medical experts examine us to prove that we were beaten and tortured," says another defendant, Sayeed Ahbat, when it is his turn to address the court. Nizam cuts him off brusquely. "If he was beaten, then he needs to write a statement of complaint -- I will not allow you to speak anymore," Nizam says, raising a pudgy hand. "Next." 
Mohamed Sharatin rises unsteadily to make his statement. He is tall, handsome and athletically built. Tears stream down his broad face, which is purple and red in parts and badly swollen. "I beg forgiveness," he begins, to which the judge nods approvingly. "I confess to reading Hizb-ut-Tahrir literature." Sharatin's crime was to be caught in possession of a leaflet from the radical organization, which labels Bush a "war criminal" and calls on the faithful to rise up against the great "Satan" that is America. "But I was simply curious and did not force anyone else to read it."
Sharatin's curiosity could cost him 19 years in Jaslyk, the notorious penal colony opened two years ago in the salt beds and sand flats south of the shrunken Aral Sea. Specifically constructed to house the growing influx of religious prisoners, the new desert gulag has developed such a reputation for torture and tuberculosis that dissidents say the only way out of Jaslyk is in a body bag -- if the pretrial interrogation, or a firing squad, doesn't kill you first. 
Uzbekistan's jails aren't confined to suspected religious fanatics. In 1995, for instance, when one of the country's former ambassadors to Washington fell out of favor with Karimov, his pregnant niece was hauled in on smuggling charges. Rather than release her on bail pending trial, as Uzbek law requires for expectant mothers, authorities aborted the fetus in a prison hospital. 
The rest of the Hizb-ut-Tahrir defendants make their statements. Finally, a defense attorney, Rustam Rakhmatulaev, addresses the court. He speaks for barely two minutes, since the outcome of most trials here is a foregone conclusion. "All the defendants have requested forgiveness under interrogation," he begins. "None of them said anything bad about the president," he adds hopefully. Insulting Karimov, whose photograph hangs in the courthouse, as it does in hotel lobbies, storefronts and schools, and whose specter seems to hover everywhere in Uzbekistan like an unseen presence, is punishable by up to five years in prison. 
"I request that the court be lenient," Rakhmatulaev says, concluding his summation. Uzbekistan's courts, however, are not inclined to mercy; not, at least, in instances in which religion threatens to impinge on affairs of state. Since the government declared its war on militant Islam in 1998, some 7,000 people, according to Human Rights Watch, have been imprisoned. Many of those were tortured and, in some cases, even killed for their religious beliefs. The campaign had drawn worldwide criticism for its arbitrariness and brutality; that is, until Sept. 11 changed the way most Americans look at the world.
And as Nizam calls for a recess before handing out a passel of 19-year sentences, it suddenly dawns on the relatives of the accused that they may not be seeing their sons or husbands for a long, long time. The families press forward, crying out, trying to reach through the steel bars for one last hug. The soldiers spring into action, linking arms and forming a human chain between the defendants and their loved ones. Slowly they push the wailing mothers, sisters and wives out of the courtroom.
Outside, Savara Umarova stands stunned by the fountain. "My brother will be an old man when he gets out," she says, her voice shaky and barely audible. "He's not a terrorist. He's just a believer."
The toppling of the twin towers has indeed muddied the waters for critics of Uzbekistan's human rights record. They strongly suspect that the Bush administration's embrace of Karimov could backfire, as have past marriages of convenience to dictators like Manuel Noriega of Panama or the shah of Iran. It's hard to tell if the new relationship will prove quite that disastrous. But for the first time since the fall of the Soviet Union, Washington is pursuing a strong, overarching foreign policy goal; in this case, fighting world terrorism (and, of course, getting rid of Osama bin Laden and his Taliban cohort). And as we saw repeatedly during the cold war, such single-mindedness often leads to moral compromises, which often end up doing more harm than whatever is gained in the original pact.
"If Uzbekistan is going to be a strategic partner," Rachel Denber of Human Rights Watch says, "then the burden is greater than ever for the Bush administration to use the leverage that it has to clean up the appalling human rights record. Otherwise, the people of Uzbekistan will draw the conclusion that the United States condones torture, unlawful arrests and other abuses." 
Nevertheless, Washington is likely to be very circumspect in criticizing its new partner in Central Asia. "We have serious disagreements with the Uzbek government on human rights and an absence of democracy as we define it," says Joseph Presel, a career diplomat who served as American ambassador in Tashkent. "On the other hand, Uzbekistan has been very helpful to us in the present circumstances, and it is my belief that the best way to foster the developments that we all want is through close and continuous engagement." 
It is unclear what engagement will accomplish in a country where the K.G.B.-schooled secret police have a hard time distinguishing pro-democracy demonstrators from hard-core Muslim militants. But nothing is simple in Central Asia. The fact is that the police-state tactics so criticized by the human rights establishment have allowed this isolated nation of 24 million to remain an oasis of relative stability in one of the most troubled corners of the globe. And Karimov's zero tolerance policy for Muslim extremism is not without its supporters both here and, increasingly, in Washington.
"I, too, am a believer," Feruza Insavaileov informs me when I call to tell her about the trial and ask if she can recommend someone to interpret from Uzbek, a Turkic tongue, into Russian, the lingua franca in post-Soviet Central Asia. "But I support what the government is doing," she adds. "I'll explain over lunch, if you want."
We meet at the Aladdin restaurant in Independence Square, one site of a bloody 1999 bombing spree by the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan -- the Afghan-based terrorist group that first announced itself a year or so earlier by decapitating a police chief and sticking his head on a stake. Security is tight around the grimy government buildings that surround the square, and Feruza, when she turns up, is pretty enough to turn many of the militiamen's heads. Twenty-three, and an administrative assistant two years out of college, Feruza says she has a story to tell that might better help me understand the "complicated" human rights situation in Uzbekistan. It's about her kid brother, she explains, and how he narrowly escaped a fate similar to the 10 convicted Hizb-ut-Tahrir members.
The story begins shortly after the collapse of Communism, when, after decades of imposed atheism, Uzbeks were suddenly free to explore their Muslim roots. At the time, missionaries were pouring into Uzbekistan from places like Pakistan, Egypt and, especially, Saudi Arabia, which flooded the country with Korans and started building hundreds of mosques.
In the Insavaileovs' neighborhood in one of the leafier suburbs of Tashkent, an abandoned mosque had reopened next to the cemetery, and one day a mysterious stranger showed up there. "Some said he was from Pakistan or Tajikistan, and others were sure he was from right here in Tashkent," Feruza recalls. "In any event, he had a long beard and torn robes, like the prophet."
This stranger aroused the curiosity of many of the neighborhood kids and was apparently very charismatic. Soon, Feruza's 12-year-old brother, Eldor, and his friends were bringing the holy man food and spending more and more time at the old mosque.
"At first, I thought it was cute," she says, "but then Eldor started acting strange." There was the constant praying and sermons about the evils of alcohol and tobacco. That Feruza's family could live with. But suddenly television and radio were also treacherous foreign inventions, and young Eldor wanted to throw the new color TV out of the house. Things just got weirder from there. "It was like he was being brainwashed," she recalls.
Feruza invites me over to her house to meet Eldor and the rest of her family to get the full story. The Insavaileovs live in Kibray, about a 25-minute drive from the capital, just past the new presidential palace Karimov is building for himself. Their home is built around a large courtyard, with an ornate gazebo in the center, cherry trees, grapevines and a hand-cranked well. There is also a barn, where the family keeps its cows -- Zoya and Milka -- and 14 chickens. A satellite dish the size of a small automobile sits on the flat tile roof. 
Feruza's father, Malik, greets us with a traditional Muslim prayer of welcome, followed by Russian-style vodka toasts. He is an onboard mechanic and navigator with Uzbekistan's cargo air carrier, and his job has taken him around the world: delivering food for the United Nations to sub-Saharan Africa, gold to Switzerland, sacrificial lambs to Saudi Arabia, generators to China. 
Feruza's mother, Zera, an economist, joins us at the table, which is laden with fruit and traditional Tatar and Uzbek dishes. Soon the conversation turns to Eldor's flirtation with fundamentalism. "Since we didn't know much about being Muslim, we initially approved of Eldor's interest in religion," Zera says. "At first, he was teaching us what the proper prayers were, about Ramadan, things like that."
After a few months of this, though, his behavior changed. "Eldor became very aggressive toward women," Feruza recalls. "He started insulting us and calling us immodest." Eldor began insisting that his sister wear a hijab, or scarf, and a robe to cover her limbs. "He complained about the way Mom and I wore our hair, said it was sacrilege."
It wasn't just at home that Feruza encountered this type of animosity. At the university, some boys who had gone abroad to study in madrasas returned with very different notions about how women should behave. It was becoming a national problem in Uzbekistan in the mid- to late 1990's, agrees Frederick Starr, a leading Central Asia scholar in Washington. "Saudi foundations were paying for young Uzbeks to study in Pakistan or Medina, and these kids were coming back with their heads filled with crazy ideas," he says. 
For Eldor, of course, the crazy ideas were available right in his own neighborhood. "We started worrying about losing our boy to a cult," Malik recalls. "It was as if he was becoming a different person." The family didn't know what to do at first. They consulted with the leaders of their mahallah, the powerful neighborhood organization in Uzbekistan that governs everything from family disputes to real-estate transactions. The neighborhood elders were equally stumped.
Around this time, the Karimov government was also grappling to find a solution to the growing problem of extremism. "Obviously, it would be political suicide for us to be against Islam, because we couldn't oppose 90 percent of the population," says the deputy foreign minister, Sodyq Safaev. "But we couldn't allow the Islamization of politics or the politicization of Islam. That would lead to chaos. We had to fight these foreign imports." 
Fortunately for Eldor, the family struck upon a solution well before the big government crackdown. By mutual agreement, it was decided that he would no longer visit the holy man and would avoid the mosque altogether. This proved to be the right choice. "Where is Eldor now?" I ask Feruza.
"He's probably tinkering with the car again," her mother suggests. "Try him on his cellphone." 
Sure enough, he shows up a few minutes later in a dirty U.S.A. T-shirt, hands covered in motor oil. Cars, apparently, are one of his new passions, now that he's 19 and earning good money in sales for a textile mill. "The new Mercedes C-Class Kompressor is my favorite," he says with the salesman's ready smile. "But it's hard to get in Uzbekistan."
He is also into Hollywood movies and pronounces Angelina Jolie's latest action thriller "excellent." Looking at him, it's hard even to imagine the Eldor of old. He doesn't really want to discuss those confused times -- though he will talk your ear off about Pentium III chips -- but concedes that "many of the things the imam told us at the mosque were wrong."
The Insavaileovs, not surprisingly, are much relieved that their son saw the light. "I'm glad Karimov is locking these Wahhabis up," Malik says. "They are a menace to society."
"Don't get me wrong," Zera says. "I'm not against religion. I'm a believer. I just don't think I need to be covered from head to toe in a burka to prove it. It's like anything in life, moderation is best."
That message, thanks in part to heavy doses of propaganda in the state-controlled media, appears to have gotten through in most parts of Tashkent, including some very unlikely places, as I discover the next day at the cockfights. The bouts are held every Sunday in an abandoned warehouse in the Kuluk industrial sector of town. It's not far from the women's prison and a psychiatric institute where a political activist was recently sent for protesting, among other things, the government's decision to bulldoze some homes to make room for a road.
The atmosphere around the ring is spirited, drawing hundreds of vocal gamblers, many of whom, with their black leather jackets, scars and tattoos, look downright scary. Several of these toughs take an unusual interest in the photographer I am traveling with, viewing his presence with clear suspicion. Finally one man jabs an accusing finger at the photographer's black beard. "Wahhabi?" he demands in a decidedly unfriendly tone. "Yevrey," the photographer shoots back -- Jewish." The tension lifts immediately, and relieved grins crease the men's faces. "Ah," one says, smiling. "I'm a Muslim. Welcome."
It's an odd but telling exchange, one that you would be hard pressed to witness in most other corners of the Muslim world. But Uzbekistan, because of its Soviet past, is a strange cultural crossroads: part Europeanized Politburo puppet, part proud inheritor of Tamerlane's 14th-century Golden Horde.
All this makes Islam an important part of the country's identity, especially since the break from Moscow in 1991. Devotion, far from being banned, is actively encouraged. Men openly walk around in dopas, the colorful Muslim caps. At Tashkent's tiny airport, hundreds of ghostly figures move about the predawn gloom: pilgrims in white robes making the hajj to Mecca. The city's huge central mosque -- erected by the Sheik Zainudin Foundation of Saudia Arabia in 1993 -- is nearly full to its 10,000-space capacity for Friday prayers. And on Saturday mornings you will find all 139 modestly veiled pupils from the Khadichi Kubra madrasa for girls studiously poring over their lessons. What you won't find there is any of the revolutionary rhetoric that has given madrasas in places like Pakistan the nickname "Jihad U." 
"There is freedom of religion in Uzbekistan," Presel, the former ambassador, says. "As long as you practice mainstream Islam." It's when you cross the line, he adds, that things can get a little dicey.
"His feet are still swollen, but he's put on a little weight and looks better," Irina Mikulina, a defense attorney, is reassuring the wife of a client she has just visited in jail. "I brought him your letter, and the food."
Her client, Imam Abduvahid Yuldashev, is serving a 19-year sentence under Article 159, which is something of a catchall provision in Uzbekistan's harsh criminal justice system. The Muslim cleric recently received 20 lashes with a bamboo baton on the sole of each foot for committing some minor prison infraction. He couldn't walk for a week, Mikulina says, but that was nothing compared with what he suffered during pretrial interrogation. "The police put a lighter to his genitals," she says matter-of-factly, as if this sort of thing happened all the time. "At first, he wouldn't tell me about it. He was too modest." 
The imam was luckier than some victims of police interrogations here, who, according to Human Rights Watch, are sent home wrapped in sheets soaked with blood, along with dubious explanations from the coroner's office attributing the cause of death to heart or kidney failure. Electric shock, beating and burning are routine tools of Uzbekistan's anti-Islamic inquisition, says Acacia Shields, a Human Rights Watch researcher who recently returned from a two-year posting in Uzbekistan. She adds that another tactic to elicit confessions involves stripping the accused's female relatives and threatening to gang-rape them in front of their loved ones.
Even some senior Uzbek officials acknowledge privately that the methods are at times excessive. "We treat Muslim extremism as a cancer that has to be cut out," one says. "But sometimes we act more like butchers than surgeons. It's, how would your Pentagon put it?" he adds slyly, "the collateral damage of dealing with such a large-scale problem." 
That's small consolation to Mikulina's clients, like Yuldashev. The 34-year-old cleric first ran afoul of the law in 1999, during the big roundup that followed the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan's bombing spree in Tashkent, which hospitalized hundreds and killed 16. Ten thousand people were detained in one week alone, Mikulina says, and the arrests were often arbitrary. Yuldashev was accused of Wahhabism, but his real crime, the attorney says, was preaching at a mosque where another outspoken imam had fallen out of favor with the authorities. Everyone associated with that imam and a dozen of Yuldashev's pupils were charged and promptly convicted, so that in the close-knit community where the Yuldashevs live you now see only very old men and very young boys -- as in wartime.
Several female relatives of the imam's imprisoned followers have gathered at his damp apartment to hear news from Mikulina about their loved ones. Mikulina does her best to reassure the veiled women, and her tough, no-nonsense manner seems to give them some strength. Away from her clients, however, she is not so upbeat. "I'm losing hope," she told me on the way to the Yuldashevs'. "Especially since the events of Sept. 11. Who is going to come to the defense of orthodox Muslims now? The government can do whatever it wants to them, and most people in the West will probably just cheer."
She has a point. Watching Yuldashev's young wife, Omina, shyly prepare pomegranates and rice pilaf, or plov, as it is known here, I find myself not worrying about how much of a sacrifice this costly display of hospitality is for a family with no income but about the dirt on the unwashed fruit and the flies on the greasy plov. Casting an eye around the barren apartment, I wonder how anyone can choose to live without furniture, television or radio, as this family's adherence to the strict Wahhabi sect requires. And looking at Omina struggle with her four disheveled children, I feel more baffled than sympathetic. 
Under her hijab, she is a very pretty young woman, blemished perhaps by her rare smile, which reveals a dowry of a dozen gold teeth. We don't speak much. Omina is too modest to talk to men, and I am the first male to set foot in the apartment since her husband's arrest. Only when she shows me photos of her husband do her dark eyes light up with real emotion. The photos themselves tell the story of a life transformed. The first shows a burly paratrooper with sergeant's stripes striking a virile pose in Red Square: Yuldashev as an 18-year-old conscript. Another, around 1991, captures a mustachioed young man on the make, in flared jeans, a suede jacket and an open-collar shirt. All that's missing is a few gold chains, and it could be an outtake from "Saturday Night Fever." The third, most recent, photograph is a mosque ID in which Yuldashev appears intense beneath a long, pointed beard, a black robe and a dopa on his head. "My husband is not a threat to anyone," Omina says. "He is a good Muslim."
It is hard to say for certain who here harbors revolutionary intentions and who is simply a victim of circumstance in the state's struggle to control people's minds. "Karimov is far less concerned with keeping the world safe from Islamic terrorists than keeping himself in power," says Shields of Human Rights Watch, adding that the crackdown on religion is a thinly veiled attempt to stamp out dissent. Opposition parties are banned in Uzbekistan, and Karimov, when he does bother to run for re-election (he side-stepped a competitive ballot in 1995), hand-picks his challengers. (The last, in 2000, proclaimed loudly that he was voting for Karimov.) 
In Washington, however, many are willing to give the Uzbek president the benefit of the doubt. "Karimov would probably win a free and fair election," Presel says. "The sad part is that he is unwilling to take the chance."
As for the crackdown on religion, that, too, has some justification, say people who follow the region. "Left unchecked, extremism could become a serious problem in Uzbekistan," says Glen Howard, a security expert on Central Asia. "Civil war, maybe, like in Tajikistan," speculates Abdumannob Polat, an exiled opposition leader, when I ask him what the ultimate result would be if the government halted its campaign against fundamentalism. 
While it remains to be seen if Washington will live to regret its alliance with the Karimov government, for now relations are rosy, and the Uzbek leader is basking in the glow of frequent photo ops with top White House officials. Indeed, cashing in on his enhanced prestige, Karimov just proposed a referendum to extend his current five-year term by two years.
Even Mikulina concedes that a majority of Uzbeks support Karimov's hard-line stand, though many get only a skewed picture of what is really going on because of the state's tight grip on the media. Omina Yuldashev found that out the hard way when she turned to her mahallah for financial assistance after her husband's arrest. Not only did community leaders turn her down, but they also subjected her to a humiliating mock trial and hate rally, in which neighbors denounced her and hurled insults at her jailed husband. "They said I was an enemy of the people," she recalls.
Not so the Insavaileovs, whose mahallah just named them "family of the year," an honor Feruza's parents cherish, prominently displaying the award photograph in their dining room. And as for Eldor, he has found a new idol to worship: Bill Gates. He even mailed the Microsoft founder a fan letter some months ago, telling him how much he admires the way he runs his company and crushes the competition. He is still waiting for Gates to write back.

HEADLINE: The Web Is In for the Short Haul, Too 

BYLINE:  By BOB TEDESCHI 

 BODY:
Like millions of other travelers this fall, Christina Washington has stayed close to home since Sept. 11. But she hasn't stopped traveling. 
 For a variety of reasons -- chiefly the terrorist attacks, but also the slowing economy and lower gasoline prices -- many Americans are shelving extended vacations in favor of weekend getaways by car, often planned at the last minute. The Internet, where last-minute travel deals abound, dovetails nicely with this trend. 
 Take the case of Ms. Washington, an administrative secretary for the City of Rockford, Ill. Before the attacks, she and her husband, Jack, a salesman, had planned to fly to Las Vegas in October. "But after what happened, I was not going to fly," she said, "so we decided to do a short trip to Chicago," which is about two hours' drive southeast of Rockford. 
Having never used the Web to explore travel options before, Ms. Washington logged onto some of the more well-known search engines, like Google.com, and found a listing for Site59.com, which specializes in discount weekend vacation packages by air or car. There, she booked a three-night Hotel Plus package at the Sheraton Gateway Suites O'Hare, a mile from the airport. 
The package, including a walking tour of Chicago, cost just under $200 for both of them. (Site59.com had the same package for early December priced at $202 for two.) Rates at the Sheraton typically are $160 to $284 a night. 
Internet travel executives say they have generally been able to withstand the travel industry's autumn slump, in part because airlines and hotels see the Web as a way to get rid of unsold seats and rooms at the last minute, quickly and cheaply. While that's a boon to discount-minded travelers, the deals are not necessarily easy to find if, like many road-trip travelers, you have a short list of destinations. 
Ms. Washington was fortunate in that Chicago is one of the roughly 30 cities Site59 includes in its Hotel Plus packages. If she were looking for a deal near, say, Albuquerque, she would have been out of luck. 
To be fair, such capriciousness is almost always the case with Internet sites that cater to the weekend traveler. Some sites are strong on destination information, but give no help in finding a room. Others offer deals on hotels but give scant details on why you'd want to visit that city. Still others offer a smattering of both, but not any great depth. 
In short, the Web is still a big help for those embarking on weekend jaunts, but it can also mean a lot of work. 
The genesis of many weekend road trips -- the "Honey, let's just get away somewhere" scenario -- often results in travelers' drawing a circle with a radius of 300 miles or so from their hometown, and nominating a few possibilities based on what they have heard about a given destination. The Web makes this process much more efficient, since virtually every town lists its tourist attractions and weekend events on the Internet. 
For suggestions from a source that's presumably more objective than the local chamber of commerce, though, the American Express site offers a useful feature, Destination at a Glance. From the home page of AmericanExpress.com, click on the Research Your Vacation link. There, click on the Choose Your Resource menu, to find Destination at a Glance. 
This has a pull-down menu, so you can quickly peruse different regional stops. There are 30 destinations in the Northeast, for instance, each with a thumbnail description of the area and links for special offers, so you can start some budget-minded brainstorming. 
You can also get a look at the four-day forecast for an area, a map of A.T.M.'s and a short list of activities, restaurants, shops and accommodations (with a link to a more comprehensive list for each). One caveat: not every destination may be completely up to date. Late last month, the Lake Placid, N.Y., section still listed Fort Ticonderoga among activities, even though it's open only from May to October. 
Once you've narrowed down the possibilities, sites like RandMcNally.com and MapQuest.com are particularly useful in filling in the details. Rand McNally, for instance, lets users type in a particular destination and choose from six types of attractions; then it lists everything that fits the bill. That these sites will also help you get to the destination, of course, is a bonus.
Assuming the aforementioned sites help you decide on a destination, finding a hotel room is the logical next step. Here, the most useful Web sites are Quikbook.com and HotelDiscounts.com. 
According to Bob Diener, president of the Hotel Reservations Network, which operates HotelDiscounts.com, the rates on his site have dropped significantly this fall. Late last month, for instance, his site listed the Caesars Tahoe for $75, "whereas we'd normally have it for between $129 and $149," Mr. Diener said. 
The all-purpose online travel agencies, Expedia, Travelocity and Orbitz, depending on their relationships with certain hotels, can sometimes offer rates that are comparable to those found at Quikbook and HotelDiscounts. 
Site59 is also worth a look. Unlike many other hotel sites, Site59 bundles something of value with its discounted hotel rooms -- in the case of Ms. Washington, the walking tour of Chicago. For some Vermont hotels, the bonus is a cheese sampler. According to Michele Peluso, Site59's chief executive, this bundling approach is intended to prevent customers from knowing which product is actually being discounted -- is it the cheese or the room -- so consumers don't think the hotel in question has gone lowbrow. 
Whatever the motivation, Site59 is fast, simple to navigate and easy on the eye. The descriptions and suggested activities for each destination are far from exhaustive, but they are helpful. And, as Ms. Washington can attest, the prices have been good of late. 
Given that it can cost more for a dinner for two at a good hotel than for a room upstairs, weekend travelers may want to use the Web to research restaurants. On this front, the online city guide services from DigitalCity.com and CitySearch.com offer some good suggestions. If the city you're interested in is covered by either Digital City or CitySearch -- and in many cases, it will be -- users can expect a decent number of reviews and, often, boxes that allow users to search for cuisines. 
Zagat.com is also worth a look. The purveyors of word-of-mouth restaurant reviews pack the site with great, and not-so-great, restaurants. The search function, however, can be moody: one recent day, the site refused to show me restaurants in the Berkshires, even though that was one of the selections on a pull-down menu. (You'd think a restaurant site would have the menu thing figured out.) 
And the list of restaurants, while long, is not as comprehensive as it could be. I tried to research restaurants in Vermont to see how to round out the Site59 weekend packages there, but Zagat apparently had nothing worth listing there. So for the Vermont tourists looking for good food, a little more surfing would be in order. While you're looking, if you've booked the right Site59 package, you can snack on that cheese sampler.

Duty-Free Shopping

BYLINE:  By Amy Goldwasser; Amy Goldwasser is a frequent contributor to the House & Home section of The Times.

 BODY:
I have bought three pairs of jeans since Sept. 11 in Lower Manhattan. I don't mean to sound unpatriotic, but I bought them because they make my bottom look good. Not because they're all-American or utilitarian or because "boot cut" and "rivet" sound kind of butch-military appropriate. Certain acts -- for starters, shopping, sex, leaving work early to see a dumb movie, ordering mashed potatoes -- are most enjoyable when not premeditated or endorsed by anyone else, when you can believe that the only economy you're affecting is yours and when neither the mayor nor the president is involved.
 But that kind of selfish indulgence just isn't an option anymore. Wherever you look these days, there's a public official telling you that these petty little pleasures are brave acts of patriotism. That may make them more noble, but it sure doesn't make them more fun. Encouragement from the public sector to go on with private delights feels like an announcement from the waiter that it's just the right time to kiss your date. Even worse if you know it's happening simultaneously in restaurants all over town. 
 My dad died suddenly last holiday season. I have probably never spent more (or earned less) money in my life than in the few months that followed. In deep grieving, I developed tastes for an odd collection of things that never interested me enough to buy before and wouldn't now: chai latte, the Palm V, an expensive, ridiculous knee-length turquoise silk tunic or whatever-you'd-call-it that has never left my closet. At the time of purchase, though, its shiny blueness made me touch it and smile, and that was no small thing. Discovering it and taking it home felt pretty organic and all mine. Had the impetus come from anyone else, however -- the shop owner offering a Now More Than Ever discount or the commissioner of public grief telling me I owed it to my father -- the sale would have never gone through. It was no more a tribute to my father than a $10,000 Prada splurge is a bulwark against terrorism. 
I have a friend who goes to Barneys in times of trouble because he's convinced nothing bad can happen there; he called me from the store's pay phone on Saturday, Sept. 15, as he had a few days after his mother died in January 1999. If it works for him, it's only because his strategy for solace is an original one, the retail involvement unsolicited.
This holiday season, the enduring denim and irony-free pop music and scented candles and Omaha Steaks and 400-page novels and puppies that we were told we wanted last year and the year before and every year in recent memory are being offered to us under a new rubric. For 2001, "inspired by events," we are targeted to want them not just now, but especially now -- now more than ever. The gravity-lending phrases can be tacked onto the end of any current slogan as seamlessly as an "in bed" to a fortune from a cookie.
There's an especially-now pitch for almost any product, with varying degrees of legitimacy. People are afraid of malls (a boon for online shopping). People are cocooning (a boon for DVD systems, pashmina blankets, leather sofas, Tickle Me Elmos, PlayStations). People are seeking answers in faith and family (sales of crosses, Bibles and Korans, self-help titles and diamond engagement rings all rose in the months following the attacks). And people are feeling patriotic, leading to more flags in more ads than anyone can ever salute.
When something like shopping becomes so serious -- a part of the war effort rather than an escape from it -- we lose our ability to act unburdened locally at a time when we're feeling helpless globally. This frustrated nation has an awful lot of decompressing to do, in movie theaters, shops and restaurants, at home. In bed. Time Out New York's annual sex issue came out in mid-October this year. Its cover exclaims, "SEX: NOW MORE THAN EVER!" If ever there was a cause that needs no patriotic rallying, this is it. I imagine that citizens of New York and Kabul alike were doing it on Sept. 10, 2001, as much as they are tonight. And as little of it for God and Country. The 2002 Zagat Survey of New York City Restaurants, published after the attacks, has a drawing of Lady Liberty's raised, torch-holding arm on the cover above the words "Stronger Than Ever." 
But what's stronger than ever? We know it's not the city's restaurant industry, which is reeling. Is the guide itself stronger than ever? Or is it that we the people who courageously patronize restaurants are stronger than ever? A preface by Nina and Tim Zagat reasons: "None of us can reverse the horrific events that caused the destruction of buildings and lives. But we can fight back by dining out." There's not a regular follower of Zagat's 2002 who's in danger of forgetting what happened to New York restaurants in 2001. 
It has become difficult to do anything in this town that isn't of national significance. I wore my new jeans to a benefit reading for a firehouse that lost 12 men in the World Trade Center attack. I saw "Zoolander" and watched the Yankees win and then lose in them. I dribbled some mango drink on them while overdoing my part in fighting back at a favorite downtown restaurant. Sometimes I wear them on the subway while reading a magazine I just bought at a local newsstand. All, it turns out, acts of accidental patriotism. New Yorkers are just trying to get on with our lives, as sometimes self-indulgent and silly and vain as they are. I feel taller than I am in my jeans. This is not to be mistaken for philanthropy, even -- especially -- now.

HEADLINE: Housing Problems The City Faces 

 BODY:
Regarding your article "Cracks in Pillar of Affordable Housing" Nov. 18 : 
 Reduction in the number of homes covered by Section 8 contracts is but one of several housing problems facing the city. 
A similar prospect faces owners and tenants in buildings built with federal low income housing tax credits and those constructed under the state's Mitchell-Lama program. At the same time we still face demographic pressures, as our city's housing stock has not kept pace with the growth in our population. We must remember that each day roughly 27,000 New Yorkers still spend the night in homeless shelters. 
 New York City faces a host of great challenges in overcoming disaster, a slowing economy and budget shortfalls. We cannot however defer our commitment to affordable housing. The social and economic costs of increased homelessness and displaced families will be significantly greater than any near-term investments. Government at all levels and the private sector must work creatively to preserve the precious affordable housing resources that have been created under Section 8 and other programs.

On Dance Floor, Jobless Meet Employers

BYLINE:  By MARCELLE S. FISCHLER; E-mail: lijournal@nytimes.com

 BODY:
STANDING on the dance floor at Chelsea Street, a nightclub in East Meadow, Kellie Ullah ignored the thumping music, moving not to the beat but from table to table, spotting prospective employers by the glowing green plastic bracelets on their wrists. 
 "I need a job," said Ms. Ullah, wearing a bright pink wristband to distinguish herself as a job hunter. She was laid off from her midtown Manhattan position as a learning and development specialist after her company's data center in the World Trade Center was lost on Sept. 11. 
 "I have two children to take care of," she said. "It's not easy. The bills don't stop coming. Everything still has to be paid even though I don't have a job." 
At Long Island's first pink slip party on a recent Wednesday evening, the mixing, networking and mingling was not about relaxing after a day at work. The crowd at the bar may have been imbibing as if it were any other happy hour, but the beer was consolation and the buzz commiseration. Among the nearly 250 laid-off men and women the talk was of changing career paths, acquiring new skills and the paucity of prospects for information-technology and middle- and upper-level management jobs.
But if anything could make Ms. Ullah, 33, feel like dancing, it was being able to hand out resumes and meet face to face with 24 headhunters and recruiters.
"This makes it more comfortable," said Ms. Ullah, referring to the informal disco setting for a job fair. "I still might not get a job, but I feel better about it. You feel like people are paying attention to you. Maybe they're not. They're making you feel better and at times like these, we need to feel better."
Lisa Cotoggio, the event planner for Chelsea Street, said the club has always done a Wednesday corporate happy hour. After holding a slew of corporate farewell parties for the newly jobless in the last six months and reading about other layoffs on the Island and job-search parties for unemployed dot-commers in Manhattan, she decided to hold one. She plastered job notices on a board by the entryway and put out blue wristbands for sympathizers and nervous employees who think a layoff might be in their near future. 
Deborah Brown, a career coach from Long Beach, runs a group called Life After the Layoff. She set up shop at a table by the upper level bar, dispensing advice and touting the benefits of networking and job hunting in a dim nightclub over a bright exhibition hall or sending a resume via the Internet.
"It's a little more laid back," Ms. Brown said. "It's not as much pressure. The atmosphere is a little less threatening."
The free buffet and the liquor, she said, calmed the aspirants down, though she recommended having a drink before seeing, but not in front of, a potential employer.
"When you send a resume to a company and the company doesn't get back to you, you feel rejected," Ms. Brown said. "At least here you feel like you can touch somebody. You are touching a recruiter. You are touching a company. You are making contact versus just this resume that just goes into the air."
When Baglan Altuntug, 31, moved to the Island from Turkey when she got married last January, she declined job offers that would have continued her career as a bank department manager. Instead, she enrolled in a computer school in Westbury to enhance her skills. Then the economy fizzled.
"Money is not important," Ms. Altuntug told Bob Schneider, a staffing specialist from Lloyd Staffing in Melville. "We just want to get our foot in the door. We want experience now."
But Mr. Schneider did not have a job to offer. Like many of the recruiters, he was pooling resumes for future opportunities.
"It's great to meet candidates right now," he said. "Hopefully when the market opens up a month or two from now, we have a candidate."
Dominick Bianco, an executive vice president with Continental Broker-Dealer Corporation in Carle Place, took a swig from a bottle of Bud Light, confident that the ball was in the employers' court.
"If we find a few quality people, we can ask them to stick around and have a drink later," he said. 
Mr. Bianco was surprised by the quality, and age, of the job seekers. Many were in their late 40's, refugees from mid- to senior-level management posts, not just 20-something casualties from the dot-coms. Several people he spoke to had been making $100,000 to $150,000 a year.
"We might be able to find a diamond in the rough at a great price," Mr. Bianco said.
In August, Ivan Leon, 40, of Manhattan went to a pink slip party in the city as a sympathizer and landed a date. Then he got laid off. At Chelsea's, he made the rounds of the employer booths, displaying the four employer business cards he collected in his hand like a royal flush. Seaman's Furniture, he said, needed accounting people and the recruiter took his resume. His background as an auditor might fit.
Besides, there were other prospects at the disco. "A woman approached me and gave me her card and put her number on the back," he said, munching on peanuts. "Now I might find a job and a date."
Tom Holmes, 25, the chief executive partner of Live Free Inc., a five-week-old Connecticut start-up, surveyed the club. He was looking for salespeople to start at $60,000.
"A bar is where people can be themselves," Mr. Holmes said. "You can see the other intangibles. You can check out their social skills. This is a great place to interview somebody." 
It's also a way for Chelsea Street to attract customers. Greg Buttle, the owner, said about 35 percent of the pink-slip party people stayed at the club after the event ended.
Sitting at the bar, Myron Kamil, 47, of Bellmore, a former vice president of finance and controller at a telecommunications company who was laid off in August, and Ron Ferraro, 51, laid off from a mid-level position at J. P. Morgan Chase last month after 23 years and four mergers, sipped Zinfandel and wondered where their next jobs would come from. Both men had children in college, were out of work for the first time in their lives and were disappointed in the level of jobs the recruiters at the event had to offer. They hoped other companies would show up at future pink slip parties, scheduled for the first Wednesday of every month beginning Feb. 6, but hoped even more fervently that they would be employed by the time the next job fair rolled around.
"It's a frustrating experience, the job search," Mr. Ferraro said. "The camaraderie of networking is extremely important."
Mr. Kamil's attention was already on other things. "Having it in a bar, even if it's not good, could be a good pickup place," he said.
As they were talking, the disc jockey announced a raffle. Mr. Ferraro and Mr. Kamil pulled out their ticket stubs and peered at the numbers. The prize was a camera bag. 
Mr. Kamil crumbled his ticket, disappointed. "I thought they were giving away a job," he said.

Chance for a Mitzvah
Santa Claus is not the only holiday spirit with a beard, spectacles and a broad appeal. There's Anchelle Perl, 47, an ultra-Orthodox Lubavitch rabbi and executive director of the National Committee for the Furtherance of Jewish Education of Nassau County.
"It's a holiday of light and we want to bring our light to you," said Rabbi Perl, presiding over his 10th annual Hanukkah telethon, broadcast to the tristate area last Sunday from Pro Image Studios in Islandia, accompanied by a bevy of dark-suited, cheerleading Hasidim, their ritual fringes flying like pompoms as they danced.
With his black hat, frail frame and pious manner, Rabbi Perl is an unlikely Jerry Lewis stand-in, pitching for dollars to launch a Center for Performing Arts for Jewish singles at his Congregation Beth Sholom Chabad in Mineola.
"I am trying to bring across traditional ideas in a nontraditional way," the rabbi said. He tap danced, pulled on an Uncle Sam hat and auctioned off a Harley-Davidson motorcycle. Among his guests were the owner of the Long Island Ducks, Bud Harrelson; the chairman of the Long Island Power Authority, Richard Kessel; and the Town of Oyster Bay supervisor, John Venditto.
In Rabbi Perl's honor, "I got this little beard started," said Mr. Harrelson, stroking a gray goatee.
"Buddy, as soon as you have a full beard grown, give me a call," the rabbi replied. "I'll give you a black hat." 
Marilyn Michaels, the singer and impressionist, was a co-host. She did her rendition of Ivana Trump and Joan Rivers, but was not allowed to sing because of Orthodox laws prohibiting women from singing in front of men. She wished her non-Jewish friends a merry Christmas.
"This is about humanity," Ms. Michaels said. "This is for people of all religious denominations. Send in a donation. It's called a mitzvah."

Pennsylvania Power Plant to Get New Life as Offices

BYLINE:  By MAUREEN MILFORD 

DATELINE: CHESTER, Pa. 

 BODY:
SOME people who grew up near the electrical power plant on the Delaware River here remember it as an ogre at the foot of Ward Street that puffed plumes of dark smoke from its head. 
 "We called it the Monster and the Monstrosity," said Bishop Dickie L. Robbins, 45, recalling the coal-fired Chester generating station, formerly owned by the PECO Energy Company. "It was huge and dismal and just had an eerie look about it." As a child, Bishop Robbins, pastor of the Life in Christ Cathedral of Faith, lived near the station, but he never set foot on the property. 
 Now, neighbors like Bishop Robbins are touring the imposing 1918 Neo-Classical building as it undergoes a $55 million conversion into offices. 
The onetime power plant is the centerpiece of a $300 million redevelopment being done by a private developer along a half mile of riverfront. Called the Wharf at Rivertown, the project is southwest of the Commodore Barry Bridge, which connects Interstate 95 in Pennsylvania with Interstate 295 in southern New Jersey.
Once inside the power plant, Bishop Robbins could not help but be impressed by the majestic turbine hall, with its 115-foot vaulted ceiling, ornamental skylights, Corinthian pilasters and bronze wall sconces. "My view of it has changed -- I see it now as a symbol of hope," he said.
For many, the commitment by Preferred Real Estate Investments Inc. of Conshohocken, Pa., to redevelop the vacant Chester Station is confirmation that the city of 36,854 is inching up from the bottom.
An industrial town southwest of Philadelphia International Airport, Chester has been battered in recent decades by poverty, drugs, crime and AIDS. Founded by Swedish settlers as Upland in 1643, it is now one of the nation's most distressed cities, according to Keith W. Reeves, who grew up in Chester and now heads the Center for Social and Policy Studies at Swarthmore College.
The violent crime rate in 1999 was 14 times higher than the rate for surrounding Delaware County, according to the center's data. Though Chester is encircled by comfortable suburbs, at least 75 percent of students at its middle and high schools are eligible for free or reduced-priced lunches. The school district, taken over by the state in 1994, has ranked dead last for academic performance among Pennsylvania's 501 districts, the center reports.
Since 1990, the population has declined by 12 percent, with burdensome property taxes helping to drive out middle-class families. Jobs dwindled to about 5,000, a far cry from the 1940's, when the Sun Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company alone employed 30,000. In the oldest section of the city, where William Penn landed in 1682, a smattering of derelict Colonial houses provide the only evidence of a place described in an area history just 60 years ago as resembling an old English city.
But residents are proud of Chester's cultural, industrial and social heritage. Penn spent his first winter in America there. Martin Luther King Jr. preached in local churches while attending nearby Crozer Theological Seminary in 1948 to 1951. The legendary singer Ethel Waters was born here at the beginning of the 20th century. And a regional artist, Andrew Turner, uses the city as a setting for colorful paintings.
"Older folks remember a vibrant, hard-working city," Mr. Reeves said. "Despite its problems, we love it."
For most of the second half of the 20th century, there was little outside investment in Chester. But since 1996, more than $500 million has been committed by the private, public and institutional sectors, according to David N. Sciocchetti, executive director of the Chester Economic Development Authority. Projects include three new housing developments for low- to moderate-income families and a new technology park near Widener University.
When the converted power plant's lead tenant, Synygy Inc., relocates from Conshohocken at the end of 2002, it will bring the largest number of jobs to the city since World War II, said Mayor Dominic F. Pileggi. Synygy, the country's largest provider of software to manage comporate incentive compensation plans, will employ 700. 
Along with other tenants -- a financial consulting firm has already agreed to take 10,000 square feet -- Synygy will receive tax relief for 10 years under a state program to stimulate job creation in deteriorated areas.
Tax benefits were important to Synygy's founder, Mark Stiffler. But Mr. Stiffler, 39, also has a love of architecture, which he studied at Massachusetts Institute of Technology before getting a degree in civil engineering and management information systems. He was struck by what the plant's architecture was meant to convey.
"At the time, electricity was not trusted," he said. "The building was built in a grand style as a marketing tool. It portrays a combination of creativity and reliability."
THE architect John T. Windrim of Philadelphia, who was on the board of the Philadelphia Electric Company, designed the plant as the utility geared up to provide power to industries that supplied the Allies during World War I. When it opened, it was considered an architectural showplace, according to Nicholas B. Wainwright in his book "History of the Philadelphia Electric Company 1881-1961." 
"If one could see over the coal piles on the landward side," Mr. Wainwright wrote, "one might mistake it for an enormous public library!" 
From its earliest days, Chester was part of the "arsenal of democracy," Mr. Sciocchetti said. Shipbuilding began in 1778, and the industry continued until the late 20th century.
Sun Shipbuilding constructed tankers and cargo ships during World War II. The Ford Motor Company had an assembly plant in Chester and made small tanks and jeeps. The Scott Paper Company occupied a full block on the river. The city's population was about 70,000 during the war years.
Today, of the major manufacturing companies of 50 years ago, only the Kimberly-Clark Corporation, which acquired Scott Paper, remains. PECO stopped generating at the Chester Station in 1982, when it moved to nuclear plants.
Despite being vacant for two decades, the Chester Station building is still magnificent, according to Michael G. O'Neill, chief executive of Preferred Real Estate. "They always tell you, 'Don't fall in love with the real estate,' " he said. "But with this building I couldn't help it." 
On the southeast side of the building facing the river are huge concrete Tuscan columns and cornices designed to look like stone. Interior details are equally striking. "It was a temple to electricity," said James B. Garrison, senior associate of historic preservation at Hillier, the Philadelphia architectural firm handling interior design for Synygy. "It was a highly symbolic structure."
PECO considered demolishing the building but sold it with 60 acres for $1 with the provision that the new owner tackle interior environmental clean-up. The remediation mostly involves removing materials in the building, which Mr. O'Neill estimates will cost $10 million.
Synygy will occupy 178,000 square feet, or nearly half the building. The turbine hall, two floors of the attached switch house and two floors in the boiler house section will be converted to offices once power equipment is removed. The company will also have a corporate apartment, fitness center and meeting rooms in one of two coal towers.
Smokestacks will be removed, and a glass penthouse floor will be added. Other elements, like the coal tower cranes, will be maintained for historic reasons. The building is expected to total about 380,000 square feet on six floors.
Once the renovation is completed, Preferred intends to build a 500,000-square-foot office building on the property. There will also be two marinas and several restaurants. 
The project, which is to be completed by the end of 2003, is expected to benefit from road improvements, including construction of a ramp to Interstate 95 near the property.
A river walk running from the Commodore Barry Bridge to Highland Avenue is to be open to the public. Initially, the developer considered putting the complex behind gates but decided that would send the wrong message, said Michael P. Balitsaris, marketing manager with Preferred Real Estate. "We realized nobody wants to be isolated like that," Mr. Balitsaris said.

Used-Car Sales Hitch a Ride With the New Cars

BYLINE:  By WARREN STRUGATCH 

 BODY:
THE advertisements promoting "zero percent financing" have been all over the papers and airwaves this fall, but what brought Michael and Susan Cespites of Port Jefferson Station to Ramp Chevrolet were the bleak prospects for the 10-year-old sedan Mrs. Cespites has been driving to work at the allergist's office where she is a nurse. 
 With 140,000 miles on the odometer, the car often requires a mechanic's ministrations. "The guy in the garage sees me and says, 'If I were you, I'd bail on this car,' " said Mr. Cespites (pronounced cess-PEED-us). "So we're looking to replace it. We want to make sure it comes with a warranty. And it definitely has to be an American-made car." 
 Late one afternoon last month, Mr. and Mrs. Cespites and their three children came to Ramp Chevrolet in Port Jefferson Station, the biggest Chevrolet dealership in New York State. Even with no-interest financing, they found that their $15,000 budget would not stretch to cover the cost of a new model, so they headed toward the used cars. Like many dealers, Ramp is selling more used cars these days, and the couple looked carefully at an Impala and a Malibu before heading inside the showroom. 
Sales of used cars constituted about 25 percent of Ramp's total sales in October, about double the usual number, said John Rampone, an owner. While the glamour in auto sales is clearly in moving new metal, profits are usually higher on what the industry likes to call "previously owned."
Mark Schienberg, the president of the Greater New York Automobile Association in Whitestone, Queens, said: "A General Motors dealer might make as little as $300 profit on a new vehicle. The manufacturer controls the wholesale price, and the sticker price is pretty much frozen. The dealership tends to make its money on used cars, as well as from the service and parts departments."
When automakers began introducing "zero percent financing" and other promotions for new cars and trucks this fall, they jump-started a year that had begun dismally. Nationally, sales for cars and light trucks have passed 17 million and are expected to finish the year a shade under last year's all-time sales record of 17.4 million, said Paul Taylor, the chief economist at the National Automobile Dealers Association in McLean, Va. "Clearly, the promotions helped boost new-car sales in the fourth quarter." 
At the same time, he said, the promotions have indirectly driven up the sales of used cars and light trucks, projected at 12.6 million this year, up from 12.5 million the year before. In October, when the sale of new vehicles spiked at 1.7 million, more than half of the buyers brought along an old vehicle to trade in, flooding dealership inventories with an additional 212,000 used cars and trucks. Other factors, including fleet-culling by rental companies and the return of leased vehicles, have helped to create what some people in the industry openly call a used-car glut.
Despite the large inventories, used-car prices at dealerships have not fallen but have increased nearly 2 percent, Mr. Taylor said. He attributed the uptick to the fact that dealers have a larger number of newer cars with more options than in the prior year. In the first eight months of this year, the average used-car price was $13,858, he said, compared with $13,594 for the same period the year before.
The auto dealers' association expects the trend to continue, a reflection of the sluggish economy. "The myth is that people tend to buy used cars in a recession rather than new ones," Mr. Taylor said. "The reality is that car sales drop, but used cars drop slower than new ones."
The growth of the used-car market also reflects a push-me-pull-you dynamic. "There has been the emergence of a near-new market, of cars three years or less in age, because of the strong volume in leasing over the last five years and the relative popularity of luxury brands," Mr. Taylor said. "It's now possible to buy a relatively young used car that is still certified by factory warranty and to purchase an extended warranty that takes the uncertainty out of the transaction." All this for a third to a half the price of a new car.
Back at the Ramp Chevrolet showroom, Steve Brian, a salesman, found that Mr. and Mrs Cespides were in no hurry to buy any of the cars they inspected. Mr. Brian tapped some information into the computer sitting on his desk, and in a moment he said he had good news. There was, he said, a blue Malibu available that fit their needs. It had 39,000 miles on the odometer, and in fact, it was one of the vehicles the couple had seen on the lot before they came into the showroom.
Mr. Cespites nodded but said nothing. Mr. Brian asked if the color was an issue. As he asked the question, he tapped away at the computer, which provided him with information on the dealership's inventory. "We have a white one," Mr. Brian said after a moment, and the price was the same, just under $10,000. "However," he added, "it has another 2,000 miles on it. And it's still being prepped, so I can't show it to you."
Mr. Brian chatted on, suggesting that the process of buying a used car was similar to buying an antique. "You see something you like -- it's one of a kind, so you buy it," he said. Neither Mr. nor Mrs. Cespites responded. "You never know," he continued, "if it will be there the next time."
The couple seemed untroubled by that possibility and left without buying. Later, Mrs. Cespites said her husband's employer, a paint shop in Sayville, had offered him great terms on a Ford Contour it owned, and the couple bought it. "They were terms we couldn't pass up," she said.
While Mr. Rampone didn't get the Cespiteses' business, he has been closing other deals and expanding his family-owned dealership, now in its third generation. Mr. Rampone is turning the eight-acre lot across Route 112 from his dealership into a Corvette showroom, which is to open next spring. He also has secured the rights to sell Hummers, now made by General Motors, and Indian motorcycles. Indian, founded in 1901, went out of business in the early 1950's but was revived two years ago by the Indian Motorcycle Company of Springfield, Ill.
Mr. Rampone said that he likes the bikes and went out of his way to become a licensed dealer. He plans to sell the motorcycles at the former Daewoo dealership he bought in Smithtown, and the Hummers from his flagship dealership in Port Jefferson Station. 
Mr. Rampone, who is a grandson of the dealership's founder, Alfred Rampone, began his career in retailing, moving to Manhattan and rising to a merchandising executive at Giorgio Armani and Bergdorf Goodman. He returned to take over the family business in 1988, he said, at a time when he felt disillusioned with the fashion industry. But he has used some of the merchandising lessons he learned to transform the hidebound world of auto sales.
"When I took over in 1988, this was the smallest Chevrolet dealership on Long Island, and now it's the biggest," Mr. Rampone said with pride. "If you want to buy a Chevrolet on Long Island, you are going to end up with us."

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/Glen Cove; 
An Unusually Inclusive Gold Coast City

BYLINE:  By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
A FORMER Gold Coast stronghold on a North Shore peninsula of Long Island's Nassau County, Glen Cove is now home to people whose means range from very great to extremely modest. Dwellings range from gated estates to subsidized apartments and rooming houses, with a variety of residential-neighborhood choices in between.
 One of two cities on Long Island (the other is Long Beach), Glen Cove is low-rise and generally suburban, with industrial patches and a center for Hispanic laborers who shape up here looking for work and often find places to live in the Orchard section. 
 In size and layout, the city looks more like a moderately sized town loosely organized around a commercial district. 
Reflecting the Gold Coast era that peaked about 1910 and ended after World War II, most of the greatest wealth is in the city's north and near the water. But public beachheads long ago opened up the grand views over Hempstead Harbor and Long Island Sound, where the financier J. Pierpont Morgan's black yacht, Corsair, once carried Morgan from Manhattan to his estate on what is now called East Island, a waterfront community of expensive to moderately expensive single-family homes. 
There are marvelous vantage points at the 62-acre Garvies Point Museum and Preserve, a county-owned Indian archaeology and regional geology museum, where five miles of nature trails weave through primordial woodland containing dozens of species of trees, shrubs, vines and other flora. 
Most of the old estates have been diced into housing lots since Morgan, F. W. Woolworth and the Standard Oil magnate Charles Pratt and his numerous sons built extravagant and ultraprivate mansions. 
The city is known now less for exclusiveness than inclusiveness. Real estate professionals and others familiar with Glen Cove say its ethnic and economic variousness sets it apart from other North Shore areas. 
"This is the real world -- yes, it is," said Carol A. Caggiano, a sales associate at Daniel Gale MacCrate Real Estate and a former city councilwoman. "It's what the world is about now, the diversity."
In a pattern common throughout Nassau, housing prices have risen substantially in the last five years. But some market segments remain low to moderate when compared with many other North Shore communities. "It's the North Shore, but it's got middle-income areas between the extravagances," said Bob Carlson of Century 21 Jimco Realty. 
Since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, sales have slowed and prices have stabilized here, as elsewhere. 
Single-family houses predominate, but Glen Cove also has a substantial number of two-family houses whose owners sometimes occupy one unit and rent the other. 
The Legend Yacht and Beach Club, a newly constructed waterfront enclave of about 40 homes on a former Gold Coast estate overlooking Hempstead Harbor, fits within the upper end of the city's real estate market, if $5 million estates are excluded. The prices range from about $750,000 to $2 million for the quasi colonials, most of them on half-acre lots. The gated and guarded entrance recalls an old Gold Coast habit. 
In midrange Roxbury, a neighborhood with many single-family ranches and Capes mostly built in the 1950's, prices range from about $325,000 to $425,000. Single-family homes in Strathmore Glen, most built about 30 years ago, go up to $500,000.
More affordable homes, many built in the 1920's, are in the Landing, an area named for its proximity to a former steamboat and ferry landing. One-family houses range from about $225,000 to $265,000. There are also some two-family houses.
Three condominium complexes -- Cove Landing, Lattingtown Ponds and Long Meadow -- were built within the last 15 years. Co-ops include the Glen Pearsall with three separate five-story buildings and Trousdale Village, a former rental complex.
The Glen Cove Housing Authority maintains 250 units, including 70 units for people 62 and older, in apartment buildings, town houses and row houses at various locations. Tenants pay no more than 30 percent of adjusted gross income in rent. 
Like the city as a whole, the Glen Cove public schools are ethnically and economically diverse. There are two primary schools for kindergarten through second grade, one of which offers half-day pre-K classes: two elementary schools for Grades 3 and 4; and a middle school for Grades 5 through 8.
At the Glen Cove High School, 59 percent of the 170 graduates in the class of 2001 went to four-year colleges and universities, while 34 percent continued at two-year colleges or technical schools and 7 percent enlisted in the military or went to work. More than half the graduates received Regents' diplomas.
College Board averages for the class were 481 in verbal and 496 in math, below the state averages for college-bound students of 495 in verbal and 505 in math.
THE high school, built in 1962 on a 50-acre campus, offers 12 advanced placement courses and a special robotics program in which students build a robot and enter it in a regional competition. The district superintendent, Mary Ellen Freeley, said another program popular with students teaches the fundamentals of business and personal financial management. 
In an academic leap forward, 60 percent of eighth grade students met the state standard in English language testing this year, up from 35 percent last year. Dr. Freeley said the increase resulted from "focus, focus, focus" on test preparation. Improvements were less striking in math, where students meeting the state standard rose from 24 percent to 40 percent. "We still have a long way to go, but we're getting there," Dr. Freeley said. 
Beginning in 1997, when the state first permitted residents of Glen Cove and more than 50 other small cities to vote on the local school budget, two budgets have gone down to defeat. But in 1997, voters approved a $2.5 million technology bond that Dr. Freeley said put Glen Cove among the technological elite districts on Long Island. At least three computers are in every classroom in addition to computer laboratories in school buildings.
Private and parochial schools in and near Glen Cove include Friends Academy and St. Patrick's elementary school.
There are three Long Island Rail Road stations within the city boundaries -- Glen Cove, Glen Street and Sea Cliff -- but the line, on the railroad's Oyster Bay division is not electrified and service is by diesel.
Some residents make private arrangements to secure parking spaces in Manhasset to ride on the Port Washington branch, whose frequently scheduled electric trains whoosh to the city in little more than half an hour. It takes about 20 minutes to drive to Manhasset.
Fox Navigation runs a weekday ferry service to Wall Street for $26 round-trip. Fares are lower for purchasers of weekly, monthly or annual tickets. The ferry leaves from the mouth of Glen Cove Creek at 6:30 a.m. and leaves Pier 11 in lower Manhattan at 5 p.m. The trip takes about 50 minutes each way aboard a high-speed catamaran with room for nearly 400 passengers.
Glen Cove has its own police force and city courts, a large public library, an array of municipal services and plenty of restaurants in downtown areas, although small shops have struggled there. 
"Everything is really right here for me," said Valerie Grella, who paid about $200,000 17 years ago for a Cape Cod now worth about $350,000. "It's diversified, it's waterfront, the restaurants are great and the night life is terrific." 
Rosemary Olsen, the executive director of the city's community development agency, was 5 when her family left Glen Cove, where she was born. She came back many times over the years to visit her grandmother and moved back for good in 1985. "A lot of people come back," she said. "There's a sense of community here."
For golfers, the Glen Cove Municipal Golf Course, with views over Dosoris Pond and Long Island Sound, charges residents and nonresidents $17 on weekdays and $20 on weekends for 18 holes. Residents must purchase an annual permit costing $50. Nonresidents pay $850. 
Three public beaches -- Morgan Park, Crescent Beach and Pryibil Beach -- are reserved for residents, although Morgan Park, a gift from the Morgan family in 1932, is also open to residents of neighboring Locust Valley. 
A city boat ramp on Hempstead Harbor near the mouth of Glen Cove Creek charges residents $10 a day or $30 a season for boats or jet ski access. Nonresidents pay $35 daily and $150 for a season. There are several private marinas. The Hempstead Harbor Club, a privately managed club owned by the city, is open to residents and nonresidents.
Tennis, paddle ball, basketball and handball courts as well as children's playgrounds are located in Stanco Park and Old Tappan Park. An eight-field baseball and softball complex, also used for soccer and football, is at the John Maccarone Memorial Stadium. There is a separate soccer complex at Pascucci Field and large numbers of local children play on junior soccer teams.
Mayor Thomas R. Suozzi, a Democrat, is serving his final weeks as Glen Cove mayor before taking office as Nassau County executive. In November, he defeated the incumbent, Thomas S. Gulotta, a Republican. Mr. Suozzi's successor will be City Councilwoman MaryAnn Holzcamp, a Democrat.
The Matinecock Indians called the Glen Cove area Musketa, meaning a place of rushes. Joseph Carpenter came from Rhode Island to buy harbor lands from the Matinecocks in 1668 and with partners built a saw mill on what is now Glen Cove Creek. Other lumber mills followed.
By 1829, steamboats brought city dwellers, establishing the area as an early summer resort. A starch factory employed Irish immigrants and a power-transmission belt company gave work to Italian immigrants beginning in the mid-19th century. Others worked at estates that wealthy New Yorkers began building in the same period. The name Musketa, regarded as too much like mosquito, was changed to Glen Cove in the 1830's. 
In the early decades of the 20th century, many residents worked in local industries and on estates. After World War II the estates declined, and the population soared with suburban development. After commercial declines in the 1970's and 80's, the city rebounded in the 90's and now harbors plans to revive a long moribund tourist industry. 
One of the city's attractions is Welwyn, a surviving Pratt family estate, which now houses the Holocaust Memorial and Education Center of Nassau County, and where nature trials are open to the public. The winding, tree-lined entrance gives some hint of what it was to live in such a place.

Residents complained that too little of the taxes paid by estate owners to the town were spent on their behalf. "We were paying a large chunk of tax money to the town, and it just dawned on people here that we could keep all that tax money if we became a city," said Daniel Russell, a Glen Cove historian. As a city, Glen Cove, with fewer than 27,000 residents, is far less populous than the town of Oyster Bay, with nearly 300,000 residents. And it is also smaller than the village of Hempstead, which has nearly 50,000 residents. Map of New York State highlighting Glen Gove and surrounding areas.

HEADLINE: Suozzi Assembles His Advisory Panels 

BYLINE:  By BRUCE LAMBERT 

DATELINE: GARDEN CITY 

 BODY:
PREPARING to take over Nassau County government on Jan. 1, the county executive-elect, Thomas R. Suozzi, has assembled advisory panels that include two former New York City police commissioners, the deans of two law schools, the co-owners of the New York Mets and other prominent business and civic leaders.
 Mr. Suozzi called his transition advisors "the best and brightest" of more than 1,000 candidates. They will serve for $1 a year and, with a few exceptions, are not expected to become county administrators themselves. 
 Their role is twofold. One is to help select prospective officials to serve in key posts in the Suozzi administration, Nassau's first Democratic regime in three decades. They will also review county agencies and functions and recommend ways to revamp the government.
As part of his shakeup, Mr. Suozzi sent letters to about 140 non-civil service officials, like agency commissioners and their deputies, asking for their resignations and also their resumes, if they wish to continue. Not all the posts will necessarily be filled, Mr. Suozzi said, as he tries to pare the government. Although most top officials are expected to be replaced, Mr. Suozzi said he does not preclude keeping some holdovers, based on performance. 
A spokesman for the Republican minority in the County Legislature, Robert Lazaro, criticized the transition, saying Mr. Suozzi's appointments of top aides are lagging behind the pace being set by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor-elect of New York City.
Given Nassau's chronic fiscal problems, a high-priority panel is the one on the budget. Its co-chairs are Adam Barsky, New York City's budget director, and Kathleen M. Carrano, Westchester's budget director.
A related panel on economics is headed by Dr. Irwin Kellner, an economist at Hofstra and chief economist of CBS Marketwatch. Other members include James L. Dolan, president of Cablevision; Rhonda Brown, president of Nine West Group; Scott Rechler, chairman of Reckson Associates Realty; Charles Wang, chairman of Computer Associates; Fred Wilpon, co-owner of the Mets; Edward Travaglianti, Citibank's president for commercial markets; John Bransfield, president of Roslyn Savings Bank and John J. O'Neill, executive vice president of Fleet National Bank.
The cochairmen of the police panel are William Bratton, a former city police commissioner, and Anthony Cancelliere, Rockville Centre's village administrator and a former police officer who will serve as a deputy county executive.
The assessment and real estate panel's cochairmen are Michael Martone, a lawyer who specializes in that field, and a state Supreme Court justice, Frank Rossetti.
Heading the panel on the county attorney's office is Joseph W. Bellacosa, the dean at St. John's University law school and a former judge.
The cochairmen of the social services panel are Willy B. Edlow Jr., president of the United Way of Long Island, and Brooke Spiro, dean of social work at Adelphi University.
On the information technology panel, the cochairmen are Bert Brodsky, chairman of the Sandata company, and Yogesh Gupta, senior vice president of Computer Associates.
The cochairmen of the community development panel are Patrick G. Duggan, director of Sustainable Long Island, a "smart growth" advocacy group, and David Mejias, a lawyer who ran unsuccessfully for the County Legislature as a Democrat.
The cochairmen of the evaluations and productivity panel are Tom Germano, the Long Island director of the Cornell School of Industrial and Labor Relations, and Hezekiah Brown, a Hempstead village trustee.

HEADLINE: Finding a Connection, Though a World Away 

BYLINE:  By ALAN BISBORT 

 BODY:
ACCORDING to an environmental mantra, one must think globally and act locally. Some Connecticut residents, however, have the means to turn that mantra on its head by thinking globally and then acting on their thoughts. Because of this, Connecticut residents have had an impact on the environmental health of the planet. 
 Stewart H. Greenfield, a Westport financier, decided in 1988 that he wanted to help protect the world's rain forest. 
 Though soft-spoken and philosophical by nature, Mr. Greenfield does not go lightly into any effort, and he brought the same focus to his conservation business that he has brought to his highly profitable Oak Investments, a venture capital firm. He was particularly drawn to the Nature Conservancy's Latin American program. 
"My concerns were twofold," Mr. Greenfield said. "One, to save the maximum amount of biomass per dollar, and, secondly, to focus on species preservation. There's such an enormous number of indigenous species in the tropical rain forest and acreage is therefore important. For the price of a building lot in Westport, you can save 100 square miles of rain forest."
Specifically, he was able to help purchase a 25,000-acre ranch on the sparsely populated high Bolivian plateau. That initial investment became the headquarters for the then-2.2 million-acre Noel Kempff Mercado National Park, home to 600 bird species (the United States is home to 768 bird species according to the Nature Conservancy).
Set along a river that borders Brazil, the park had been ravaged by drug traffickers and timber poachers, who had built a bridge across the river and logged hardwoods. An on-site inspection convinced Mr. Greenfield it was time to make some serious moves.
"When I visited in 1991, we went to the center of the lumber operations," Mr. Greenfield said. "We saw incredibly wasteful cutting of mahogany, where only 10 percent of the hardwoods were used.
"It's a major problem to re-establish mahogany because trees don't grow in separate stands in the tropics. On an acre down there you'll find 125 different species of trees, whereas here you are lucky to find eight species."
The Brazilian government has since interceded to stop the poaching and a Bolivian environmental group worked to disassemble the bridge. The national park has expanded to four million acres, when the Bolivian government rescinded timber licenses on an adjoining 1.8 million acres. 
"The park is now half again as large as Connecticut," Mr. Greenfield said.
Dorinda and Mark Winkelman of Essex have assumed a different role. Before this year, they had acted locally, donating $250,000 to protect the tidelands of the Connecticut River. But, after being offered a chance to visit Palmyra Atoll, a "flyspeck on the map" 1,052 miles south of Hawaii, they donated $1 million toward the purchase the fragile sanctuary, considered the last marine wilderness of America's tropics.
The atoll, a fragile cluster of islets, covering 680 acres of land and 15,512 acres of reefs, has three times as many coral species as all of Hawaii, and it is one of the few nesting areas for sea birds within 450,000 square miles.
"This came about in a serendipitous way, when Mark went bonefishing," Dorinda Winkelman said. "The fragility of the atoll is just incredible. It is said to have one of the biggest indigenous forests in the Pacific, just a few acres of a dwarf pin oak that looks more like scrub. No indigenous people were displaced by the project, which was an extra bonus that made it special."
The Winkelmans' gift also kick-started a Nature Conservancy grant program, whereby the national office gave 50 percent in matching funds to the state chapter. Thus, saving the Pacific atoll will have an effect on Connecticut's landscape as well.
"The Greenfields and the Winkelmans provide a great example for the kind of thinking and generosity we'll need to succeed at global conservation in the years ahead," said Dennis McGrath, director of the Nature Conservancy's Connecticut Chapter. 
The Winkelmans' gift also spared Palmyra a different fate.
"There was some talk to use it as a dump for plutonium rods, and the Japanese were interested in basing a seaweed processing plant there," Dorinda Winkelman said. "There was a real opportunity to protect it, and the Nature Conservancy put together the deal, with the U.S. government." 
Other projects, of course, beckon. Mr. Greenfield, for one, continues to focus on Latin America, partly because he has seen positive results. He has also donated to programs in Paraguay, Panama, Costa Rica, Belize, Mexico and the Dominican Republic. 
"Environmental concerns were a low priority 20 years ago, but there's a growing body who have been able to use television to inculcate in the people the rich holdings of species and natural gifts that they have in Latin America," Mr. Greenfield said.
Jim Brunton, who is based in Westport, runs JAB Enterprises, a computer software company whose profits drive the work of two conservation efforts, the Pajaro Jai Foundation (www.jabinc.org) and Ocean Wood Gallery, which sells "rain forest furniture" and other products created by indigenous peoples.
The area Mr. Brunton seeks to protect is the Darien Rainforest in Panama, and his conservation partners are the indigenous Chocoe Indians in the village of Mogue.
Their symbol is a boat, named the Pajaro Jai (a half-Spanish, half-Chocoe phrase that describes a phoenix-like bird). This 92-foot ketch, due to be completed in July 2002, is being built by the Indians from the hardwoods found in the nearby forest.
Though it will become the foundation's flagship, it is the resurrected kindred spirit of the original Pajaro Jai, also built by the Chocoe and launched in 1986. That vessel had a string of environmental successes, including being a driving force behind preserving the coral reefs of Montego Bay in Jamaica, but it was lost in a tropical storm in 1991.
"The key to everything is to let the people themselves do the work," Mr. Brunton said. "We can't solve ecological or human economic problems with Band-Aids. Money alone sometimes brings action to a halt. I've seen it do more damage than good."
Mr. Brunton said the Chocoe are skilled with their hands, "so the project emphasizes boat-building and furniture."
"But, in the long run," he added, "we want to create an economic development dynamic inside the culture itself, to catapult them 20 years ahead. They'll be eaten alive if we don't."
Mr. Brunton dates his relationship with the Chocoe to 1967, when as a Peace Corps volunteer he found himself in the Panamanian rain forest.
"They had dignity, beauty and an intact culture, and I began to fear that my presence was going to destroy some of this," Mr. Brunton said. "Fate dropped me, an ordinary person of average morality, into an extraordinary situation. Since the cultural disintegration would proceed with me, or without me, would it be a cop-out to walk? Might I contribute to a healthier future in some way?"
Almost 40 years later, Mr. Brunton is still involved with the Chocoe. "All of this comes from my guts, from knowing these people," he said. "Trust is important."
Mr. Brunton said that the products the Chocoe can produce from a single tree in the rain forest are worth the income generated from 40 acres of cattle grazing, and three trees can generate as much income as a village the size of Mogue's entire cropland.
"Despite all the awareness and efforts to do green business in the tropics, the rate of destruction of the rain forest is increasing, not diminishing," he said. "Something we're doing is wrong."

HEADLINE: A Holiday Gift for Retailers: Plenty of Sales Help 

BYLINE:  By FRAN SILVERMAN 

 BODY:
LAST year, Emmanuel Hemelsoet, the manager of the Eddie Bauer store at the Stamford Town Center, was having such a tough time finding employees to staff his holiday shifts that he walked the mall trying to recruit employees from other stores.
 This year, he is turning people away. 
 "Loads of people came in," he said. "We are feeling much more comfortable."
With the economy sagging, retailers across the state said they are having an easier time finding holiday help. Many said they haven't had to advertise for employees as aggressively as last year, offer quite as high salaries and have been able to hire more experienced staff. 
"Last year, people thought they were doing me a favor by walking in and punching in," Mr. Hemelsoet said. "This year, if they don't do their job, I can politely say goodbye."
The labor market was so tight last year, retailers went to some unusual lengths to hire staff, offering benefits and employee discounts to their part-time temporary help that they had not offered in the past. And still some stores were unable to fill their spots.
John Michaels, co-owner of Michaels Jewelers, said he had to offer his existing staff time and a half to work extra shifts at his 12 stores in the state last year and a higher base salary regardless of experience. This year, he hasn't had to.
"Because there is more unemployment, people are not switching and jumping, so we have less turnover," said Mr. Michaels, who is offering his staff between $8-$15 an hour based on experience. "People are more committed to what they are doing and are willing to inconvenience themselves to work the extra hours."
Marc Gratt, 54, of New Fairfield, a car salesman, is working nights and weekends at Macy's at the Danbury Fair Mall for the season. He said he had earned less at the Honda dealership in commissions than in previous years and sought the part-time holiday job to help make ends meet.
"It's getting harder and harder to make the car sales," he said. "Business is not as good as a year ago. The economy is playing into everything. You just don't know what will happen next."
Megan Wicklund, 23, works at the pocketbook counter at Macy's. She graduated from the University of Connecticut in June, but has been unable to find a job. She said she had interviewed at an insurance company in Boston three times, but the company has a hiring freeze, so she applied to Macy's shortly after Thanksgiving. The store offered her $8 an hour and a 20 percent discount on purchases.
"I'm living home with my parents, so I will save up some money and try to develop a wardrobe for when I do get a job," she said.
Retailers said the big question this year is not whether they will be able to fill their sales spots, but whether shoppers will fill their stores.
"What's on everybody's mind now is how business is going to be, will we do the same numbers as last year," said Kevin Keenan, general manager of Westfarms Mall in Farmington.
Retailers said they had seen an increase in applicants from people who were recently laid off and those looking to earn extra money in an uncertain economy. In October, the state unemployment rate was 3.2 percent.
Deidre Goodrich, marketing director at Westfarms, said there was a sudden surge of applicants looking to fill retail slots right before Thanksgiving.
The mall kept lists of which stores were hiring at the customer service desk and handed out dozens of them to people looking for work.
"That certainly didn't happen last year," she said.
She attributed the surge to unease among workers about their financial security.
"When you hear a lot of mixed news about how things are going in the economy, if you see an opportunity to make yourself a little more secure, you will go for it," she said.
A spokeswoman for Filene's said the department store chain had cut back on recruitment efforts this season.
"We've seen an increase in applicants over last year, more walk-ins and as a result we've been able to reduce our advertisements for sales help," said Robin Reibel, the spokeswoman.
While Ms. Reibel wouldn't discuss details about holiday staffing needs or what salary and benefits the department store is offering its temporary workers, she said the stores were able to fill most of their staff levels this year.
Larry Davidson, chief executive of Weathervane, a New Britain-based chain of women's clothing stores, said the quality of holiday applicants had improved from last year. While he attributed the change to an increase in the store's popularity, he said the economy was also playing a role. 
"We've been able to be a little more selective and to hire quicker," he said. "The applicant pool seems hungrier. Last year, there was trepidation of would you be able to fill your positions, forget quality, could you just find them."
Two years ago, Bob Hertzel, owner of Kleins of Westport, a frame and stationery store, had to take out advertisements to attract holiday help. This year, people approached him for work. 
"I had two or three applicants right away," he said. "The applicants were older and had more experience."
Retailers said staffing for the holiday season was tricky this year because of the uncertainty of the market following the Sept. 11 attacks. Mall traffic dropped from the previous year by 5.3 percent in October, plummeting by 17 percent on Halloween alone. Traffic dropped by 7.4 percent on Thanksgiving weekend, according to the National Retail Traffic Index.
Because of the drop in sales, many retailers said they didn't expect to need as many holiday workers as last year -- and can't afford to hire as many.
Mr. Hertzel usually hires three additional workers for the holiday season. This year, he hired just one.
Isiah Robinson, manager of FAO Schwarz in Stamford Town Center, said the store hired only 12 extra workers for the season this year. Last year, the store hired between 15 and 20.
"We had a lot of people come in this year, but we didn't need them," he said.
Leon Magarian, owner of Travel Necessities at Westfield Shoppingtown in Trumbull, didn't hire any holiday help this year. He said sales plummeted in his store, which sells luggage and other travel-related items, after Sept. 11.
"Business is very bad. Last year, I hired three workers, this year, I can't afford to hire anyone," he said. "I am working seven days a week, 12-14 hours each day."
Mr. Magarian said sales were down by 40 percent from last Thanksgiving. 
Other retailers said sales were starting to pick up.
"Our traffic was up over last year on Friday of Thanksgiving weekend," said Karen Pollard, general manager of the Brass Mill Center in Waterbury.
Mrs. Pollard said stores in the mall, stung by last year's tight labor market, recruited earlier this year and were easily able to find enough workers. 
Tim Phelan, president of the Connecticut Retail Merchants Association, said consumers might surprise retailers this year.
"Consumers are starting to bounce back," he said. "They weren't necessarily ready at Halloween, but they may be by the time Christmas comes around. Retailers may not feel a great need to staff like they did last year, but the need is still there."
Because of the unpredictability of the holiday market, retailers said they ha've had to be more fluid with their staffing levels this year, hiring part-timers who could easily expand or reduce their hours depending on sales levels.
"We are being very careful and monitoring what our needs are every day," said Ms. Reibel of Filene's. "It requires a closer eye than in other years."

HEADLINE: Certainly a Recession, but an Odd One 

BYLINE:  By HARLAN J. LEVY 

 BODY:
RESTAURANTS from Southport to Vernon to West Hartford are crowded; some manufacturers are reporting growing profits and are considering hiring more workers; housing permits are up, and defense contractors are saying they expect to have a good year in 2002.
 What kind of recession is this? 
 The state, along with the rest of the country, was slipping into recession before Sept. 11, when the terrorist attacks pushed the economy over the edge. But while the national unemployment rate rose to 5.4 percent in October, the Connecticut rate actually fell to 3.2 percent, down from 3.6 percent in both August and September.
By all accounts, this recession isn't going to be anything near what the state experienced during the last one, when from 1989 to 1992 the state lost 158,000 jobs, jobs that weren't fully replaced until January 2000. This time many economists estimated that only a maximum of 45,000 jobs will be lost and the recovery will begin as early as the middle of next year, although the recovery itself may be slow. 
"We will stop the declines in jobs in 2002," said Daniel Kennedy, senior economist at the Connecticut Department of Labor. "In 2002 we'll be trying to come out of it, and it's going to be anemic. You may see some job growth in 2003, but nothing significant until late 2003 and early 2004."
Economists said that what is muting the recession in the state, at least so far, is that the economy is more diversified than it was during the last recession and that the state does not have to contend with the speculative building boom and bust and subsequent bad debt crisis of 10 years ago. Also, the growth in service jobs has offered some protection, said Steven Lanza, an economist at the University of Connecticut.
"Services are holding up pretty well," Mr. Lanza, "and our economy is more reliant on service jobs."
Nicholas Perna, an economist in Ridgefield who was chief economist for Fleet Financial Group, said that barring anything unexpected, like another terrorist attack, the downturn will not last long.
"This recession will be over in four or five months, and it's going to be followed by a fairly impressive recovery," Mr. Perna said. "We're going to look a lot like the national economy, and the national economy should be out of recession next spring, around March or April."
Stimulation from the 11 interest rate cuts with another one possible, the federal tax refunds that were distributed this summer, "plus the added defense and security outlays ought to make for a pretty decent expansion starting in the spring," Mr. Perna said.
Although October figures show that durable goods manufacturing, financial services, retail and wholesale trade, and technology continued to have the largest job losses, which started after Sept. 11, pockets of profitability sprinkled statewide have some business owners very relieved.
Owners of moderate-priced restaurants in Southport, Stamford, Vernon, Hartford, Glastonbury, Avon and West Hartford all said they had solid though not spectacular 5 percent to 6 percent increases from September through November over the same period last year.
It took anywhere from one to six weeks after the attacks for their businesses to recover, they all said.
"Weekends are particularly strong, but there's less during the week," said Richard Rosenthal, owner of the Max chain of five restaurants in Hartford and its affluent suburbs. "People are spending, but businesses aren't. People go out on the weekends. But when the boss decides he needs to make year-end numbers, he freezes discretionary spending."
The Southport Brewing Company and its sister location in Stamford had "a lot of corporate parties cancel," the owner, William daSilva, said. "Now it's starting to pick up again. We're booked for Christmas both places, partywise."
In manufacturing, the W. E. Bassett company of Shelton, which employees about 120, also reported growing sales. It makes the Trim brand of nail clippers and emery boards.
Sales are up 13 percent for the year through November over the same period last year, with a 25 percent gain in October and 20 percent in November, William Bassett, the president, said. After Jan. 1, he said, a decision will be made on "how many permanent employees we will need to hire."
On the other hand, Allyson Bernard, a real estate agent in Danbury and president of the Connecticut Association of Realtors, has seen a drop in her residential sales. Ms. Bernard usually sells or buys about 25 to 30 homes a year, most going for $200,000 to $300,000.
"Before Sept. 11, I had four to five active listings and eight to 10 contracted buyer clients on average," Ms. Bernard said. "Now I have three listings and five contracted buyer clients, but it's not all doom and gloom."
The end of the year is traditionally slow, she said, but low interest rates and sparse inventory have kept traffic flowing, and prices have held steady.
"Buyers are waiting and being more patient," Ms. Bernard said. "Before, if a new property came on the market they might make an offer right there and then. Now they sleep on it. The good news for everybody involved is they're more positive and committed once they decide to go forward."
Ms. Bernard, reported home sales down in most of Fairfield County, with an average price of $381,734, down from $403,506. The Greater Hartford market saw new listings rise, with an average price of $201,594, up from $187,694. Eastern Connecticut had more home sales in the third quarter with an average sale price of $190,891, up $14,000. And the shoreline/Middlesex County area had fewer home sales from Sept. 1 through Nov. 28.
Lux Bond & Green, a jewelry, watch, and giftware chain with stores in Hartford, West Hartford, Glastonbury, Westport, Greenwich and the Mohegan Sun casino, reported profits off "double digits" in September. But October and November were up by "single digits," said Marc Green, the owner.
"We were pleasantly surprised at how much business came back in Fairfield County," Mr. Green said. "But the merchandise is a little different mix. I'm selling a lot more religious jewelry and charm bracelets, and we've sold more engagement rings in all the stores."
Some of the state's largest employers are also continuing to report solid results. 
United Technologies, the Hartford defense contractor, showed a 14 percent third-quarter gain in earnings, although it announced in October that it would be cutting 2,500 jobs in the state. The drug company, Pfizer, which has a research operation in the New London area, also reported double-digit earnings growth in the third quarter. The company also predicted it would have an even better year in 2002, as did Fairfield-based General Electric.
Still, the manufacturing industry lost 1,600 state jobs from September through October, and for the first 10 months of the year 9,200 jobs disappeared from the same period last year. Most of that was in durable goods manufacturing. James Moor, a professor at the University of Connecticut Business School, said he doesn't expect the manufacturing industry to do well.
"It always tends to take it on the chin in a global recession," said Mr. Moor, formerly chief economist at the Hartford Financial Services Group. "This is the first synchronous global recession since the early 1980's, so exports, which we are long on in Connecticut, are not going to be a strong suit."
He also said that a lingering weakness will persist in financial services, "which is getting the double whammy of a recession plus World Trade Center losses for local insurers and re-insurers in particular."
The state reported that it lost about 4,000 jobs from the end of September through October, but actually gained 800 jobs from October of last year. With forecasts ranging from 35,000 to 45,000 jobs lost for this recession, the overall total of lost jobs would be a mere quarter of the last recession's.
Minnie Clancy of Bloomfield, who worked for LSG Sky Chefs of East Granby, which prepares in-flight meals for airlines at Bradley International Airport, lost the job on Sept. 25. Her job became expendable when many airlines cut back meal service on domestic flights.
Since then Ms. Clancy, 49, has applied for similar food service jobs but has had no luck. "The places I did have luck I didn't want it because it starts back at the bottom again," she said. "I'm finding very low-paid jobs, and even those are snatched up, so I'm giving up right now."
In October, the state had 542,200 service jobs, down 600, or 0.1 percent, from 542,800 during the previous October, but up 1,300 from September. Restaurant services gained 300 jobs, health services 2,300 jobs, hotels lost 200, and business services lost 5,300 from October 2000. Restaurant jobs, such as Ms. Clancy's, however, fell by a total of about 2,000 in September and October.
Construction, usually hit hard in recessions, actually increased by 200 jobs from September through October, although they were down by about 2,000 from the previous October.
Transportation, communications, and utilities lost 1,000 jobs between September and October, with 2,200 jobs lost from October, 2000. The retail and wholesale trades lost 1,800 jobs from September to the end of October and lost 3,800 jobs compared with October, 2000.
The recession has also hit the state's tax revenues. For the first 10 months of the year, total tax revenues declined 4.3 percent. Although revenues fell 7.9 percent in September compared with the same month last year, revenues in October fell only 3.2 percent.
Housing permits also showed some life. The state issued permits for 820 units in October and 7,912 for the year through October, compared with 7,850 a year ago.
Economists warned that there are still many unkowns. Consumer spending, for example, is a key issue, much of it coming in the fourth quarter as people shop for the holidays.
"Consumers represent two-thirds of Connecticut's gross state product, but it's difficult to forecast anything in these times," said Mark Prisloe, chief economist of the State Department of Economic and Community Development. He said that with New York State reporting a 30 percent decline in Wall Street bonuses this year, spending on big-ticket items such as cars and vacations will likely decline, especially in Fairfield County.
Edward Deak, an economics professor at Fairfield University, said other risks include the war against terrorism, increasing personal bankruptcies and business failures, the erosion of the dollar, energy prices and supplies, and the effect of job worries.
"The risks are just a laundry list of potential events, some or all of which may never materialize," he said. "However, collectively they raise concerns that breed caution at a time when cyclical recovery demands confidence."
How long before Connecticut gets back on its feet is the big question, Mr. Kennedy said.
"To quote Yogi Berra," he said, "it ain't over till it's over."

HEADLINE: In the Region/New Jersey; 
Restoring the Glory of an Early Hotel in Cape May

BYLINE:  By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
BEFORE Cape May turned from a whaling colony to a premier seaside resort in the middle of the 19th century, there was Congress Hall, among the first large hotels in this coastal community and in the state.
 Though the building, where four United States presidents summered, has changed its look, size, name and even use over the years, it has stood on the same site since 1816. It is on four oceanside acres on Beach Drive in the heart of this city of sea breezes and waves that tango with the beach at the southern tip of the New Jersey shore. Cape May is also a national historic landmark, thanks to its Victorian-era buildings, more than 600 of them, colored mauve, chartreuse or pink and adorned with turrets and gables as well as wood trim that looks like lace. 
 Congress Hall, with its tall colonnade and sprawling back lawn, is among the last of the grand shore hotels and until recently was mostly dormant and in need of repair. Now the L-shaped hotel is nearing the end of a $22 million rehabilitation that will return it to its former grandeur and help keep alive memories of the city's glory days. 
When it opens in April, the hotel will have 104 guest rooms and five suites, a 150-seat restaurant, a nightclub and a ballroom that will double as a conference center, with nearly 3,000 square feet of meeting space. The new Congress Hall will welcome guests year round -- not all shore hotels do -- and it will include 16 retail shops. 
Cape Advisors Inc. of Cape May is restoring the Federal-style, four-story building according to federal guidelines. Financing is coming from public and private sources, including federal historic-rehabilitation tax credits.
Curtis J. Bashaw, who with Craig D. Wood founded Cape Advisors, called the project an opportunity and an "emotional experience." 
Mr. Bashaw, 41, a local hotelier, spent summers as he was growing up at a range of jobs from dishwasher to bell hop at Congress Hall and the 330-room Christian Admiral Hotel, which was razed in 1996. A grandfather of Mr. Bashaw, the Rev. Dr. Carl McIntire, headed the Christian Beacon Press, a religious group that owned both hotels before it declared bankruptcy in 1990. 
In a 1995 transaction sanctioned by the bankruptcy court, Mr. Bashaw and Mr. Wood bought the mortgage of both hotels from the lender and the land under them from Christian Beacon Press. The price was $4.5 million. 
Seeing Congress Hall restored is good news for the city. "It is one of Cape May's last links to the 1800's," said Luciano V. Corea Jr., the city administrator. It also means additional tax revenue, he said. Projections are that the restored hotel will contribute more than $200,000 in local property taxes a year, compared with the $35,000 it now pays.
Still, getting to this point has not been easy. There is a legal challenge from neighbors worried that the project would hurt the area if the hotel's lawn is used for overflow parking for guests, as it has been for decades. The parties are trying to reach a solution through mediation, a process that will not hinder the hotel's opening, lawyers for both sides said.
The rehabilitation is also proceeding at a time that the state's lodging industry has slipped, as the recession and the effects of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 take their toll. Through October the statewide occupancy rate was 66.6 percent, down from 69.6 percent a year earlier, according to Smith Travel Research in Hendersonville, Tenn. 
The impact is harshest on business hotels in the northern part of the state, said Sean F. Hennessey, director of the hospitality consulting group at PricewaterhouseCoopers. But the expectation, he added, is that the statewide market will not see "a massive number of closings, since hotels have more of a cushion to absorb a downturn today than they did the last recession." 
The Congress Hall project, Mr. Hennessey said, "could have a good deal of merit," given the general lack of sizable shore hotels. In light of the sluggishness of the economy and consumer concerns about traveling by air, resort communities will benefit from a surge in "drive-in business," he added. 
That has helped to keep business fairly stable so far in Cape May, where a number of tourism businesses have made a concerted effort to extend the season beyond the end of summer, local lodging professionals said. "We will fare well in the 2002 season, if gas prices and the stock market stay the same," Barbara Jackson, executive director of the Chamber of Commerce of Greater Cape May, said, noting that the city is within a three-hour, 175-mile drive of 18 million people. "Here, you can really get away, step back in time and feel safe."
She said the restoration of Congress Hall, "has also created a buzz" and will draw the curious. The developers said they intend to attract not only tourists but also a business and meeting crowd.
UNLIKE some other hotels or motels in town, Congress Hall will have a liquor license, which is available only to hotels with at least 102 rooms.
The market for conventions is still an unopened niche in Cape May. But Mr. Bashaw said he had successfully tapped it at his 24-room Virginia Hotel -- a tattered Victorian building he restored in 1989. 
Congress Hall opened in 1816 as a three-story boarding house called the Big House and soon became a hotel. It was given its current name after its owner, Thomas H. Hughes, was elected to Congress in 1828. The hotel's appeal and size grew through 1878, when it was destroyed by fire; it was rebuilt to its present design the next year. 
For most of the 19th century, it was a dazzling attraction, visited by Presidents Ulysses S. Grant, Franklin Pierce and James Buchanan, and President Benjamin Harrison made it his summer White House. The composer John Philip Sousa also performed there and wrote the "Congress Hall March" in its honor.
With the 1920's came competition from other seaside towns, like Atlantic City, and the Depression turned Cape May into a sleepy town. The hotel closed and did not reopen until after World War II. 
From 1968 to 1995 the Christian Beacon Press, headed by Mr. Bashaw's grandfather, owned Congress Hall and the Christian Admiral. Dr. McIntire, a firebrand radio preacher and pastor of the Bible Presbyterian Church in Collingswood, drew his followers to both hotels for Bible conferences and seminars. 
In 1990 the group filed for bankruptcy and eventually the Christian Admiral, which was in far worse condition than Congress Hall, was condemned. After attempts to salvage that hotel failed, Cape Advisors in 1995 bought the mortgage on both hotels and the land under them. The next year, as required by the bankruptcy court, the Christian Admiral was razed. 
Its seven-acre site was subdivided into 26 single-family building lots. They were sold to pay creditors, Mr. Wood said. 
Essentially, Mr. Bashaw added, the Christian Admiral was sacrificed to save Congress Hall. Over the next three years the partners secured the approvals and financing to proceed with the rehabilitation. 
But some neighbors opposed the project and in 1999 challenged the city's approval, contending the approvals violated federal laws for such preservation projects. They also said the Congress Hall renovation would have a negative impact on the surrounding historic district if parking on the hotel lawn continues. 
The court dismissed the complaint, and the neighbors appealed. Last year the appeal was stayed, pending mediation. 
Mr. Bashaw said he is optimistic a solution will be reached. So are Mr. Corea, the city administrator, and Philip Walker, a lawyer representing the neighbors. "I am hopeful we can come away from this in a way that benefits all involved," Mr. Walker said.
Meanwhile, the renovation continues. The work, 80 percent completed, includes installing 11 miles of new plumbing and 18,000 slate roof shingles as well as removing, cleaning and reinstalling 158,000 bricks. The 19th century facade is also being restored. 
Inside, the rooms, some with balconies, are being refurbished to reflect how they looked in the 1920's when the hotel was last renovated. They will be furnished with antiques and fixtures original to the hotel, and the bathrooms will have tubs and pedestal sinks from the renovation era. 
Mr. Bashaw said the goal of this project, like Mr. Hughes's 1816 original, "is to create a place within the bones of this special building that people will see as their second home by the sea."

Pleasantville: Film Center Success Has Ripple Effect

BYLINE:  By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
THREE years ago, Salvatore Arcidiacono, a commercial real estate broker and property owner in Pleasantville, had 20 empty storefronts for rent in the economically struggling downtown area of the village. Today he has only one.
 One important factor in the turnaround in the eight-block business district, Mr. Arcidiacono said, was the opening last spring of the Jacob Burns Film Center, a multiscreen complex for foreign and independent films. The film center, which is at 364 Manville Road, makes use of a building that was built in the 1920's as a movie theater but housed offices in recent years. 
 The nonprofit center's board had anticipated selling 500 memberships in the first year; instead, it has sold 5,000 in only six months. Admission prices are lower for members than for the general public. 
"The new theater certainly has had an impact," said Mr. Arcidiacono, a lifelong resident of Pleasantville, explaining that the popularity of the film center theater has had a spillover effect.
In the past six months, there have been more pedestrians on the sidewalks, especially in the evenings -- with many of them coming from distant parts of the county and even from New York City and neighboring counties. Restaurateurs said they were serving more meals, and merchants reported that sales were up.
"The Film Center appears to have put Pleasantville on the map," said Martha Krakow, branch manager for Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage. "It's brought a panache to the town. It used to be so sleepy in the evening that everything closed up at 5. Now it's lively."
The village had been without a movie theater since 1987, when the popular Rome Theater, which opened in 1925 and had 459 seats, ceased doing business. "People loved the Rome," said Toni Emerson, whose grandfather Pancrazio Aucello built the original theater in the Spanish Mission style -- with a barrel-tiled roof, porticos, outside columns and pediment -- architectural details that remain. 
Ms. Emerson, a member of Pleasantville's Chamber of Commerce and the co-chairwoman of its Business Support Council, recalled attending movies on Saturday afternoons at the Rome when she was growing up in Pleasantville in the 1940's and 50's. For the 14 years the village was without a movie house, there was a feeling that "something was missing," she said.
After the closing of the Rome, which was a two-screen theater in its later years, and before the site became the home of the Jacob Burns Film Center, it was converted into an office building with photographic studios for an advertising agency. "Then we got wind of the Burns Film Festival proposal, although no one dreamed at first that it would become as popular as it has," Ms. Emerson said. "It really has had a cascading effect on real estate and business."
In 1998, Stephen Apkon, a former merchant banker and now the executive director of the film center, formed the Friends of the Rome Theater, a nonprofit organization, and purchased the 11,000-square-foot former moviehouse and a 6,000-square-foot parcel of land next door for $1 million.
Another $4 million was spent for design and construction, and today the film center covers 18,500 square feet and houses three theaters: one with 260 seats, another with 140 and a third -- a screening room -- with 72 seats.
The center, which opened in June, has been financed in part by a $1.5 million gift from the Jacob Burns Foundation, a family foundation named for a local lawyer who died in 1993. The foundation also got $4.5 million in tax-exempt bond financing assistance from the Westchester County Industrial Development Agency, only the second nonprofit arts organization to do so. The Music Conservatory of Westchester in White Plains was the first, also receiving $4.5 million in tax-exempt bond financing. Typically, such bonds provide long-term purchase financing and short-term construction funds during renovation.
The complex was designed by Davis Brody Bond Architects of Manhattan, which also did the Rose Building at Lincoln Center, including the 268-seat Walter Reade Theater and the Juilliard School. 
NATHAN HOYT, an associate partner at Davis Brody Bond, said it was decided to leave intact what remained from the Rome Theater -- mostly the exterior -- but not to recreate the Spanish style, most of which was obliterated by the advertising firm. 
"Especially inside, there was nothing much left," Mr. Hoyt said. "So rather than mimic what was there once, we created a fairly contemporary interior. We did the addition in a modern style in contrast to the old building."
"But we didn't want it to look like a multiplex, so we gave it a more artistic look and created a more downtown kind of space with industrial materials like concrete flooring in the lobby," he said.
The architects also used steel and slate for the stairs and aluminum mesh on the acoustic panels rather than fabric. And they left the interior brick walls exposed.
"Since there would be foreign and independent films shown here, we gave the center an organic look," Mr. Hoyt said. "We chose honest materials as opposed to glitzy or fancy finishes."
Next door to the theater, one of the new commercial tenants in the village, Michael Marchica, the owner of I Fetish Optique, an eyeglass store, installed awnings outside, new plate glass windows and oak floors inside 700 square feet of space owned and formerly occupied by Mr. Arcidiacono as a newspaper and candy store. Mr. Marchica declined to say how much he paid to revamp the storefront, but he did say his investment was paying off because of what he call "the resurgence in Pleasantville."
Mr. Arcidiacono, who owns 6,500 square feet of commercial space next door to the theater, said his properties are now more in demand than ever. And although he would not specify what rents he charges, he said most properties in the village go for about $20 a square foot a year -- several dollars a square foot higher than two years ago.
Across the street from the film center, Carol Greenman, the owner of the Village Bookstore, said her business in August was double was what it had been a year earlier at another site in the village. When she lost her lease on the first store, she moved to the present storefront, which is 1,700 square feet, and paid more per square foot, in part because it is on a corner and in a more prominent location. "It's been worth the extra cost," she said. "It's been a good synergy between the theater and the bookstore, in spite of the economic recession we're experiencing."
Tara Klein, who plans to open a bed-and-breakfast in the village in a 215-year-old wood-frame Victorian house that was to be demolished, said she and her husband, Russell, an architect, were "inspired by the film center" to undertake their venture. 
"We probably wouldn't have considered something like this a year or two ago," she said. "The film center has laid the foundation for all kinds of new and needed businesses in town."
Another entrepreneur, Warren Schloat, the president of Schloat Properties, has a proposal to build a 60,000-square-foot retail, office and residential complex in the village.
"I had my plans before the film center came in," Mr. Schloat said, "and I didn't say to myself, 'Wow! The Burns is open and now I'm going to build this.' But the thing is, I have a growing confidence in Pleasantville, and certainly, the Burns is part of that. I would be planning the complex even if it were not for the theater, but now my confidence is off the charts."

HEADLINE: IN PERSON; 
Creating a Community of Theaters

BYLINE:  By JILL P. CAPUZZO

 BODY:
HE may have played Tevye in "Fiddler on the Roof" and Fagan in "Oliver," but it soon became painfully clear to John McEwen -- with no singing voice and minimal dance talent -- that his love of theater would need to be redirected. Offstage.
 Mr. McEwen's onstage experiences were as a teenager. He soon decided to direct his energy toward the business side. Now after 15 years in theater and arts development, he finds himself as the executive director of the New Jersey Theater Alliance, a statewide consortium of theater companies that offers marketing, research and advocacy for the theater community. Mr. McEwen, who lives in West Orange, will be shaping theater programs and policy for the alliance's network of 23 senior professional theaters and 6 affiliate members. 
 Mr. McEwen, 40, says his passion for theater dates back to his childhood, when he saw his first professional stage production: "South Pacific" with Betsy Palmer at the Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn. His own performing days were short-lived -- mostly summer stock theater in his teens, since his high school in Linden (where his father was assistant principal) didn't have a drama department. His interest in the business side of theater began when he was an undergraduate student at Montclair State and he served internships at the Berkshire Theater Festival and later as jack-of-all-trades at the Ensemble Studio Theater in New York City. 
"Once I got behind the scenes I began to see how theater could be used not only to entertain but also to help in community development, how it has so many other points of value, how it can nourish the soul," Mr. McEwen said.
While Mr. McEwen was getting a master's in arts management at New York University, he was back at the scene of his first theater encounter, working in the box office of the Paper Mill Playhouse. After finishing the program in 1987, he went to work as an assistant in Paper Mill's development department and quickly moved his way up to development director, overseeing an annual $3.5 million fund drive and a $7 million capital campaign. In his 14 years at Paper Mill, Mr. McEwen also initiated many new programs, particularly those addressing the needs of the handicapped, which have become models for theaters throughout the state and country. 
Paper Mill Playhouse was the first New Jersey theater to provide sign-interpreted performances. The theater was also equipped with an infrared system that beams the actors' dialogue into the earpieces of those with hearing problems; for the blind, the earpieces also provide an account of the action on stage. Before performances, the theater also puts on "sensory seminars," allowing those with vision problems to feel the costumes, sets and props to gain a better sense of the play.
"These programs have had a huge impact on the theater going experience for those with handicaps," said Angelo DelRossi, executive producer and president of Paper Mill. "And they were all brought about with John at the helm."
Mr. McEwen's sensitivity to the disabled was awakened by a childhood friend with muscular dystrophy. "We'd listen to music and play checkers together," he said. "And I just knew how much I enjoyed theater myself and if I lost the use of my arms or legs or sight, it would be devastating."
Mr. McEwen founded the New Jersey Arts Access Task Force in 1995, to promote access for the disabled to other theaters. He also served as chairman of the Theater Alliance board at that time. His advocacy on disability issues won him a number of awards, and also gave him a statewide presence in the theater community that made him a natural choice to become the organization's second executive director, following Laura Aden, who announced her departure last summer.
"Laurie led this organization through so much growth and success, replacing her would be somewhat daunting for anyone," said Michael Stotts, the chairman of the Theater Alliance board and the managing director of the George Street Playhouse in New Brunswick. Mr. Stotts said Mr. McEwen had done a good job filling Ms. Aden's shoes.
"He brings a tremendous amount of experience and knowledge of all New Jersey theaters, as well as the entire funding community and all the relationships that are needed to keep theater going," Mr. Stotts said. 
Supported by financing from the New Jersey Council on the Arts, the Theater Alliance began as the New Jersey Theater Group in 1981, changing its name last year to reflect its bigger mission of fostering a statewide identity for New Jersey's professional theaters. 
Before taking over at the Theater Alliance, Mr. McEwen had a short stint as vice president of development at New Jersey Network, where he formed a close bond with NJN's executive director, Elizabeth Christopherson. He also stays in touch with Ms. Aden, who has joined the Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation, a big contributors to the arts in New Jersey. Having these connections at a time when a weak economy has philanthropists reconsidering where their dollars will be best spent is vital to the state's theaters, most of them nonprofits. 
"Theaters tend to operate on a week-by-week basis and they are certainly feeling the pressure, but I haven't heard any stories of panic yet," said Mr. McEwen, who is encouraging theaters to continue pursuing givers and to discuss their post- Sept. 11 situations. 
Besides private donors, many theaters depend on grants from the state's Arts Council, which may be affected by anticipated belt-tightening by the state next year. 
But despite a downturn in the economy and the threat of cuts in state funding, Mr. McEwen predicts that the impact of the Sept. 11 attacks will be positive for theater.
"The word 'community' is taking on a whole new meaning," he said. "I think people are starting to look around and see what's right in their own backyard. And what better way to bring a community together than theater?" As one of his first initiatives, Mr. McEwen is organizing a symposium to discuss the impact of Sept. 11 on the theater community. The symposium, which will take place next month, is being financed by the Dodge Foundation. According to Mr. Stotts, this program represents the direction he sees the Alliance moving in under Mr. McEwen.
"It was John's idea to bring together artists and professionals to talk about the effects these events have had on our lives," Mr. Stotts said. "He'll be a great leader in identifying new projects and programs necessary for the times we are in."
Besides increasing the alliance's role as a forum for exchanging ideas, Mr. McEwen had set a goal of visiting all 23 member theaters by the end of the year. Since taking over in August, he's made it to about half of them, which, despite the relatively compact geography of New Jersey, has turned out to be quite an accomplishment. The members range in size from the 99-seat Cape May Stage to the Paper Mill, at 1,200 seats the largest equity theater in the state.
All member theaters are treated equally in the alliance's direct mail campaigns and other promotional programs, which are a major thrust of the alliance. Mr. McEwen says he'd like to see the marketing efforts tied into the state's tourism promotions.
"The beaches in New Jersey are great, but the culture here is amazing too," he said.
While Mr. McEwen refused to say which of the state's theaters he thinks are doing a particularly good job, he did suggest "keeping an eye on" some of the newer and more experimental theaters, like Luna Stage and 12 Miles West in Montclair and the New Jersey Repertory Company in Long Branch.
And what does he do with his time off? Attend the theater, of course, taking in four to six plays a month. His favorite recent productions have been "Three Sisters" by the New Jersey Shakespeare Festival in Madison, "Lady Day" at George Street and "Red, Hot and Blue" at Paper Mill. But his theater viewing isn't always Jersey-centric; he did catch "The Producers" on Broadway.
And though he hasn't set foot on a stage for a number of years (except to solicit donations), it's clear that theater is in Mr. McEwen's blood.
"I can't say anything else has brought me more joy in my life," he said, breaking into a smile that creased his eyes. "It gave me direction, purpose and pleasure. I've found what it does for me, and in watching other people what I see it doing for them, very fulfilling."

Health Care: The Sound and the Fury

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER; Jennifer Steinhauer covered health care at The Times for three years. This is her last column.

 BODY:
DURING the year and a half that I have been writing a column about the economics of health care, I have received e-mail messages from readers calling me shortsighted, hopelessly antimanaged care, maddeningly pro-managed care and just plain dumb.
 I have never been happier. 
 One thing I have learned, in covering health care generally and in writing the column, is that few subjects interest so many people more. One can write a front-page article about the doings of the mayor of a major metropolitan center (as I do in my new job, covering City Hall in New York) and hear nary a voice from readers. But write a column about prescription drug costs or even something as remote as the debate over defined contributions in health care plans, and the e-mail rolls in. 
The lessons? People care deeply about health care. And both those who receive it and those who provide it are profoundly dissatisfied with the way it is delivered these days. Many believe they have the solution. Patients feel mistreated by their doctors, who in turn feel abused by managed-care companies, which, for their part, feel misunderstood and that they are scapegoats of both groups.
No issue was too tiny, too "inside baseball," to attract attention. I was extremely impressed and often moved by how people explained their opinions and frustrations, often at length. Sometimes the stories were terribly sad -- a parent who lost a child, a young man struggling with advanced cancer, an elderly person with myriad medical problems who could not understand the paperwork involved in reimbursement for prescription drugs. In terms of legal and policy experts, there are no shortages in this business. And they are always willing to help me wade through federal waiver argot and tricky insurance laws.
Of all the columns I wrote, none generated as much comment, and perhaps as much controversy, as the one in July, describing how doctors were becoming fed up with patients whose first priority was finding doctors who participated in their managed-care plans. Many doctors were dropping the plans altogether, and saying goodbye and, in some cases, good riddance, to patients.
In the column, I noted a letter from Bradley A. Radwaner, a cardiologist in Manhattan, to the New York attorney general. In it, Dr. Radwaner described a common feeling among many doctors:
"Since the vast majority of patients cannot distinguish a quality, experienced and well-trained physician from one who is simply personable, decisions are made based on $10 co-pays versus paying full fees," he wrote. "Patients want referrals only to 'participating' physicians so they have to pay as little as possible." As such, he was moving out of managed care.
Doctors by the droves wrote in, agreeing with him. "The inability to control the way we practice medicine and deliver care to patients is the reason that physicians are leaving medicine in record numbers," one of them said. "I can tell you that on an ordinary working day, if I didn't have a single patient to see, I would still be busy for eight or nine hours doing nothing but paperwork and phone calls that are directly related to managed-care issues."
Patients often had something quite different to say. "I doubt that a single doctor I have seen over the last 10 years would know me if he or she fell over me on the street, including my current 'primary care physician' whom I have probably seen six or seven times over the past two years," one reader said in an e-mail message to me. "The feeling I get is that I am just another widget coming down the medical care assembly line."
She added: "I don't get the feeling the doctors care one whit about me as an individual. This particularly struck me when I recently was seeking a specialized type of medical care and I telephoned some providers trying to locate the right one for me. The first question with which one was invariably assaulted on the phone was not 'What could we do for you?' or 'What problem(s) are you having,' but, rather 'What insurance do you have?' "
Health care is one of the most dynamic and interesting subjects to cover as a reporter. Just when you think you understand some aspect of federal health insurance, bioterrorism or community health insurance rating, you find a whole new angle on it -- a state that does something different from all other states, or a doctor who has found a way, where none have gone before, to try to make things work. 
It was an honor to explore those issues here. Thanks to all those who helped set me straight. And thanks most of all for reading.

HEADLINE: Meltdown Worries Literally Hit Home 

BYLINE:  By COREY KILGANNON 

 BODY:
AS concern over the security of the Indian Point nuclear power plant has grown since Sept. 11, much of the worryhas been over the health threat of a potential nuclear accident.
 Many people conjure nightmares of Chernobyl-on-the-Hudson, but environmental groups say that the more likely scenario is less extreme, one with a minimal health threat but widespread damage to property. If radioactive fallout from a meltdown contaminates portions of the county, making them uninhabitable, residents could lose their homes. 
 The property issue is coming to the fore now because the Price-Anderson Act, a federal insurance program that covers power plants in the event of a nuclear accident, is set to expire in August. 
The act, which puts a cap on what plant owners must pay to nearby property owners, was approved by the House of Representatives last month in a verbal vote in which only a small fraction of the 435-member body participated. The Senate is set to consider it early next year.
Environmental groups want the cap removed so that a larger number of homeowners will be compensated. 
Many members of the House were not on the floor during the vote, said Rob Ostrander, a spokesman for Representative Sue W. Kelly, whose Congressional district includes Indian Point and much of Westchester around the plant. Mr. Ostrander said Mrs. Kelly hoped that more scrutiny was paid to the legislation before the hasty voice vote.
"The Congresswoman feels that Price Anderson should be fully debated and revisited and that the nuclear industry needs to be held accountable for their actions," he said. "Residents should not be left footing the bill in the event of a problem at any nuclear plant."
Few homeowners' insurance policies cover loss due to nuclear accidents. The standard, most widely used policy, the Homeowners-3 plan, does not cover certain risks, including floods, earthquakes, war and nuclear accidents.
Allison Bertsche, a spokeswoman for State Farm Insurance Companies, the leading insurer of homes in the United States, said policies don't cover nuclear accidents because "the loss would be so extensive that it could put us out of business."
"Everyone talks about survivability and health risk with a nuclear disaster," said Stephen Kent, a spokesman for the Indian Point Safe Energy Coalition, "but short of that, there is a serious financial risk. People could lose their homes and still be on the hook for their mortgage. Some people might say it's silly to point to property damage when you're talking about nuclear accident, but it's a reality."
The nation has roughly 100 operating power plants; there are more people living within 10 miles of Indian Point than any other reactor. But there is little awareness among residents of the limited liability.
"If you asked 100 homeowners in Westchester County, most would tell you they were insured against disaster," said Alex Matthiessen, executive director of Riverkeeper, a Garrison-based environmental group, "but the fact is, they're not insured against nuclear disaster. You would have to sue and get in line, and once the payouts totaled $10 billion, you and I and everyone else would walk away with nothing, even people who owned their homes before the plant was built."
But Larry Gottlieb, a spokesman for Entergy, the company that owns Indian Point, said the watchdog groups were recklessly exaggerating the situation.
"We feel very confident that the money would more than cover damages resulting from an accident," he said. "Security is very strong at Indian Point, but even in the worst case scenario, if you needed to dip into funds, they'd be there."
Mr. Gotttlieb accused the groups of using scare tactics and strategically trying to exploit suburbanites' sensitivity to property values.
"They say, 'Look at what happened at Chernobyl,' and that's a terrible example to use,' he said. "We could not have a Chernobyl-type disaster here. We use a different technology. You're not going to have uninhabitable areas where people can't live again."
The Price-Anderson Act, first enacted in 1957 and renewed every 10 years thereafter until 1987 when it was renewed for 15 years, allows nuclear companies to carry a relatively small amount of commercial insurance and pay money into one collective fund to cover claims nationwide. Liability is limited at $9.5 billion in total payouts per accident.
Watchdog groups call this a tiny fraction of the amount of damage to health and property that would likely be caused by a major accident. They point to a study that estimates actual damages at hundreds of times higher. The study, the Calculation of Reactor Accident Consequences (CRAC-2) report, was prepared for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and published by Congress in 1982. It estimated the "peak" number of deaths and casualties that would result from a meltdown at reactors including Indian Point.
UNDER a so-called Class 9, or worst-case meltdown scenario at Indian Point 3 reactor alone, the report estimated peak property damage at $314 billion, in 1982 dollars. Local environmentalists say that, adjusted for inflation and the rise in real estate values since then, the figure is probably closer to $2.3 trillion today.
"It's the taxpayers who would have to pay the costs," said Richard L. Brodsky, who represents the area in the State Assembly. 
Antinuclear groups have fought for years to have the limit lifted, calling it an unfair subsidy to the nuclear industry, and having taxpayers assuming risks above the $9.4 billion limit.
The nuclear industry claims that without the limit, it would be unable to get insurance protection from private companies. Officials argue that the act provides a large pool of funds in the event of a meltdown and a simplified procedure for victims to collect immediatelywithout having to prove anyone was at fault, only that damage was caused. Without the act claims could be tied up in court.
"You look at Chernobyl and everything within 30 miles is uninhabitable," said Karl Coplan, a professor of law at Pace Law School. "How many million-dollar houses are within even 10 miles of Indian Point?"

HEADLINE: They've Got a Little (or Not So Little) List 

BYLINE:  By NADINE BROZAN 

 BODY:
THE holiday tip proffered to the doorman, super, porter, handyman or concierge -- or, in the suburbs, the gardener or gatekeeper -- is the gift no one wants to discuss. 
 People who confide their most intimate secrets to strangers turn silent when asked how much they intend to slip into the envelopes they pass out at Christmastime. 
 But silence does not mean they're not calculating to whom they should give tips or how generous they ought to be. Should a cash gift be a reward for services past or an insurance policy for the future, an obligation or a courtesy? Those are questions owners and renters grapple with every year, and then keep their solutions as confidential as their tax returns. 
"People talk more easily about sex than they do about money, and tips are money," said Renee Solomon, a professor of social work at Columbia University who also has a private therapy practice on the Upper West Side. "They wouldn't even talk about it at the holiday party in the lobby the other evening. But they do want to know how much to give. They want to be fair and repay employees for kindness and service, but they don't want to look foolish or stand out in any way." 
Moreover, this year there are financial and emotional considerations fostered by the downturn of the economy and the World Trade Center disaster to be factored in. 
"Every year I've gotten more than before, but this year, I don't know -- it looks pretty bad," said Sixto Mendez, who has been a doorman at the Fairview, a 422-unit co-op building in Forest Hills, Queens, since 1974 and who received $6,000 last year. "We have a lot of people unemployed this year. The mailman has told us he has never seen so many unemployment checks." 
In addition, Mr. Mendez said, 24 members of his union, Local 32 B-J of the Service Employees International Union, were lost in the World Trade Center collapse, and 2,000 jobs disappeared. "As long as we have jobs and salaries, we must be grateful, and whatever we get in tips, we get," he said. 
In addition to tips from individuals, the staffs of many co-op and condo buildings also receive year-end bonuses from the boards of the buildings in which they work. Based on longevity and performance, these payments tend to be at least a week's salary but frequently are more. 
"Virtually all the buildings we manage provide some sort of holiday bonus," said David Kuperberg, president of Cooper Square Realty, which manages more than 100 buildings in Manhattan. "I've seen bonuses as low as a week's pay and as high as $15,000." 
But no matter how bountiful the bonus, it does not let residents off the hook for personal gratuities. In some buildings they are spared the anxiety of figuring out who gets what by a system of pooling, where all the funds are combined and divided up by the management. That seems to work better in large buildings where there are phalanxes of employees.
"There are advantages and disadvantages," said Ronni Lynn Arougheti, president of Heron Ltd., a brokerage and management firm and treasurer of the Park Avenue co-op building where she lives. "The recipients don't know who gave what or even who contributed, and the staff knows that it is being doled out pro rata and not necessarily according to merit."
On the other hand, pooling does insure that the behind-the-scenes workers like porters and night doormen who have little interaction with residents get their fair share.
"I once worked in a 1,200-unit building downtown where they pooled," recalled Carl Perrault, who has been the super at Berkley House, a 118-unit co-op building at 120 Central Park South, for two years, "and we only got $150 each." At his current building the gifts are distributed directly. "I like this better," he said.
So do the 10 doormen, elevator operators and porters who work with him. "The men look forward to it every year," he said. "But they don't tell me how much they make. That's pretty personal." 
However much they are, gratuities can constitute a good chunk of income, which under the Local 32 B-J contract, covering most of the employees in the city, is $704.63 a week in the "handyperson" category and $639.63 for concierges, porters, doormen and other staff members, excluding superintendents. 
Enrique Calo Jr., who said from behind his lobby desk at Saga House, a 23-unit condominium at 157 East 74th Street, "Call me concierge, because that sounds better than doorman," estimated that tips can account for roughly 10 percent of his income. "They pay for my education," he said, explaining that he is a student at the Manhattan Center of Nyack College, where he is majoring in Bible and history. 
Like the four other doormen on the staff and Erika Pest, the super there, Mr. Calo wears many hats. "We polish the wood; take out the garbage; do the mail, the packages, the dry cleaning; deliver the groceries," he said, "and the gifts do reflect that we have multiple jobs." 
In addition, Ms. Pest said, bonuses equal to four to seven weeks wages are usually given by the board. "I think this is the best building in New York City," she said, "the management and the people who live here are very respectful of the staff; they're almost like friends." 
As executive director of the Council of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums, Mary Ann Rothman is familiar with a wide gamut of tipping styles. But she prefers the more personal approach for herself. "I never reach in my pocket during the year," she said. "At Christmas I want them to know the tip comes from me, shake their hands, look them in the eye and thank them for services rendered in the course of the year." 
Owners in the 415-unit Century condominium at 25 Central Park West have a choice of contributing to a pool or expressing their appreciation directly to staff members. 
The fact that there are 57 names on the holiday greetings distributed throughout the building does not daunt Roberta Brandes Gratz, the urban affairs writer, who said: "We are one of the largest buildings in the city. We have three entrances, six elevator banks and all the service elevators are manned." 
She winnows her gifts down to the people with whom she and her husband, Donald Gratz, have personal contact or those who service her line of apartments in the building, which occupies the block from 62nd to 63rd Street. 
She is helped along in that task by the fact that the staff list includes names, job titles and areas of the building to which individuals are assigned. 
For example, Ms. Gratz, who has lived in the Century for 30 years, said: "There are 18 people in the janitorial, porter and elevator category, but only three of those are on my line. There are only two full-time doormen on my door, so when you break it down, it becomes less awesome. But it does take real work to figure all this out."
For those who are left to their own devices, there is official advice from New York City.
According to a pamphlet entitled "Tips on Tipping," first issued in 1999 by the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs, $30 to $100 is appropriate for superintendents, $25 to $100 for doormen ("Consider if they actually open the door for you," the booklet says) and $20 to $30 for custodians and handymen. However, those sums presume that those employees periodically receive tips ranging from $1 to $25 each.
The agency also suggests that car owners who regularly use a garage allot $20 to $25 for each parking attendant. Newspaper delivery people should get $15 to $25.
Though many people are unaware of it, as government employees, mail deliverers are officially barred from accepting cash gifts, said Pat McGovern, a spokeswoman for the New York area of the postal service, adding, "Certain items like soda, coffee, doughnuts and calendars are not considered gifts."
Similarly in places where the trash collectors are municipal employees, acceptance of money is prohibited. 
COMPANY policy at FedEx bars deliverers from taking cash gifts, but Hilka Klinkenberg, founder and managing director of Etiquette International, said, "If you're running a business from home and get several deliveries a week, you could give them small gifts like cookies or chocolate." 
At U.P.S., Dan McMackin, a spokesman and former driver, said that there was no formal regulation prohibiting deliverers from accepting cash but that they were trained not to do so.
"We do recognize that our service providers have a special relationship with our customers," he said. "But if, from time to time, especially at Christmas, customers would like to present a token of appreciation, that's certainly fine." When he was a driver, he said he was given tokens like socks and food.
On her Web site, Ms. Klinkenberg recommends holiday gifts of $50 to $100 for superintendents and building managers, $25 to $100 for doormen, $20 to $50 for elevator operators and $10 to $20 for porters and handymen. 
But in a phone interview, she emphasized the role of economic circumstance and geography.
"You should pay according to how tony your address is," she said. "If you live, say, on Second Avenue in the 90's, that will be different from living on Fifth Avenue in the 60's. If you make several million and drive a Bentley, that will be different than if you earn $60- or $70,000 and drive a Taurus."
For those who have suffered an economic reversal -- a shrinking investment portfolio or, more drastically, a job loss -- Ms. Klinkenberg advised, "If you're not making ends meet, get a card, tuck in $5 and a little note saying, 'I wish this could be more. You deserve it.' "
Another consideration is the frequency with which residents tip during the year. "If you tip the doorman every time he carries a shopping bag for you, you will be giving him a lot of money throughout the year and should give less than if you gave at the end of the year," Ms. Klinkenberg said. 
People in the suburbs, especially those in single-family houses, have far fewer candidates for tips. While there may be no doormen, porters or handymen with outstretched palms to be accommodated, there may be gardeners, snow shovelers (assuming there is snow), newspaper carriers and other delivery people. In addition, in gated communities ranging from small and secluded compounds on the North Shore of Long Island to the sprawling towers of Newport in in Jersey City, there are the gatekeepers, who keep watch over entrances and are happy to see residents with envelopes in hand at this time of year. 
"If you have a gardener, he is probably working for you on a half-year basis, so give the equivalent of a half a week's fee," Ms. Klinkenberg suggested. "If that same guy is the one who shovels your snow all winter, then give a week's fee."
Hal Schwartz, a graphics designer and photographer who moved from the Upper East Side to Scarsdale in 1994 and now lives in Hastings-on-Hudson, said: "I give the garbage men $50 to split among themselves, the newspaper boy $10 and the postman $20." 
When he lived in Manhattan, he said, "I gave the superintendent handsomely -- about $100 -- and in exchange he made sure I had a place to store my bike." 
In many community associations, it is not customary to give holiday tips. Scott Pohl, president of the Twin Rivers Homeowners Association in East Windsor, N.J., explained: "Our staff does not perform individual services for residents. They mow the lawns, clear the street, collect the leaves, repair the walks, but that is all part of the maintenance fee. Most people here tip the mailman, and that's it." 
The situation in suburban apartments more closely approximates the city. "Most residents here tend to tip the mail carrier, the superintendent, the U.P.S. and FedEx deliverers and the housekeeper who maintains the common areas," said Lisa Galaz, the business manager for Clocktower Close Apartments, a 132-unit loft rental building in Norwalk, Conn. 
In the past, she said, "The super has gotten up to $200 from one person and as little as $10."
Ms. Galaz was not optimistic about how much residents would be able to give this year. "I think it's going to be considerably less than in the past," she said. "Most of our residents work in Manhattan and a number of them, mainly in upper management, have lost their jobs." 
Several years ago, the Applied Companies, which owns and manages properties in New Jersey, recommended that residents of a rental building they owned in Jersey City tie the amount of their tips to the size of their apartments. Some tenants did not appreciate the advice. "People thought it was either mandatory or offensive," said Leigh Carr, senior vice president for property management. "Now we would never set a standard for anyone. 
"This is a very tough year to make recommendations. People are more strapped, but they may also be more appreciative of what they have, so they may give more."
Though many employees of residential buildings say they are hopeful about prospects this season, they do not know whether a shrinking economy portends shrinking tips. 
As Benny Diaz, an elevator operator at 120 Central Park South, put it: "Every year it changes. Some years are better than others, and last year was wonderful. I'm hoping it will stay the same."

P.S. (Your Name Here)

BYLINE:  By ROBERT STRAUSS 

DATELINE: BROOKLAWN 

 BODY:
JEFF BROWN was a bit perplexed over the summer when Mayor John Soubasis asked him to lunch. To Mr. Brown, who owns the only supermarket in this small Camden County town, the ShopRite of Brooklawn, a call from the mayor could only mean trouble.
 "We've done little things for people in town, helped pave a roller hockey rink, helped someone short on funds for food," said Mr. Brown. "But when the mayor calls you to have lunch, you know it's something bigger than that." 
 What Mayor Soubasis had in mind at that lunch meeting is now seen as a unique arrangement. He asked Mr. Brown to put up some money to effectively buy naming rights to a new gymnasium for Brooklawn's only school, the Alice Costello Elementary School.
Last month -- after mulling over the mayor's offer -- Mr. Brown, who also owns five other ShopRites in the suburbs of Philadelphia, pledged $100,000 over the next 20 years to pay the debt service on the $1.7 million gym. When it is finished next year, the gym will be known as the ShopRite of Brooklawn Gymnasium.
Michael Yaple, a spokesman for the New Jersey School Board Association, said he knew of no other sale of naming rights for any part of a school building in New Jersey and, as far as he can determine, anywhere else in the country.
"Certainly, advertising is in the public schools," he said. "But there is nothing permanently named in return for a donation, not until now."
So far, no voice has been raised in protest in Brooklawn, a community that is not particularly well off in terms of per capita income. The fact is, school officials would not have been able to build the gym without a tax increase or some other help.
"We've crossed the line and we know it," said John Kellmayer, Brooklawn's superintendent of schools. "The issue is really the privatization of civic responsibility. In an era when infrastructure needs to be updated and it's hard to raise taxes -- well, we may be the first to do this, but I can assure you we won't be the last."
Even in such wealthier districts as Cherry Hill, where Mr. Brown lives, the Brooklawn experiment is being taken seriously.
"Oh, yes, we're open to things like this," said Cherry Hill's superintendent of education, Morton Sherman. "I can assure you if you come up with a million or two for us, we'll find a place for your name." 
Brooklawn -- a town with little crime and little abject poverty -- finds itself in a position more difficult than that of a larger town, said Mr. Kellmayer. For one thing Brooklawn is rated by the state as one level above the poorest, so it gets little state aid. 
On the other hand, nearby Gloucester City, a larger city but with a similar economic profile, is one of 30 districts to obtain supplemental state aid -- $31 million in this case, while Brooklawn is receiving none.
While Brooklawn has been a stable community, Dr. Kellmayer and Mr. Soubasis realized that the school system had to improve for the town to remain that way. Last year, Brooklawn was designated a school-choice district by the state, meaning that starting next year any student in Camden County can attend Costello and the state will pay the pupil's tuition.
"Brooklawn is a safe school with high-achieving kids and small classes," said Dr. Kellmayer. "We have a good start."
Still, there had to be a more substantial reason for students from other communities to seek out Costello, so Dr. Kellmayer and the school board came up with innovative programs in music and technology.
"We would infuse the curriculum from kindergarten to eighth grade so, if the student and parents chose it, they would in effect be majoring in music or tech for their time here," he said.
But doing that meant upgrading. The gym was one thing. And now there are other projects on Dr. Kellmayer's wish list -- a library media center and a technology center, for instance.
"So we're out looking for sponsors there, too," he said. "They kid us about looking for sponsors for a center-jump circle and a scoreboard, but I'd think about them, too."
For his part, Mayor Soubasis said he would not stop sponsorships with the schools, noting that he had already been soliciting in the town for businesses that might want to help pay for a new street sweeper.
"Anyone who helps out will have their names printing on the side so that when the sweeper goes through town, everyone will see," he said. "When I got to council a few years ago, I saw how difficult it was to do a budget in a small town. I'm into creative finance, so this idea came up. I'm saving clippings now to show people in other towns later who talk against this. When they end up doing it, too, I'll have them."
But Dr. Kellmayer said there were lines he would not cross.
"Look, no one is suggesting us contracting with Delilah's Den," he said, referring to a gentleman's club in Philadelphia. "We wouldn't consider a product tie-in. There wouldn't be a Coke Tech Center here. No alcohol or tobacco or guns, anything like that."
He went on: "But everyone uses food, so we contracted with a supermarket, a local supermarket. We're talking to local banks, people like that." 
For his part, Mr. Brown eschewed the idea of naming the gym after himself or his family.
"I have an ego, but I thought it would be best to have a sense of the community there," said Mr. Brown. "ShopRite of Brooklawn keeps the town name on it. I could have done advertising elsewhere, but this tells us we are sticking here in this community, trying to build it."
Moreover, Dr. Kellmayer said the gym and proposed tech center would be open to the entire community during nonschool hours.
"In this sense, it is a multiple win," he said. "We really couldn't raise taxes. There are many seniors here who would just not be able to take the increase. But we needed improvements and now everyone will be able to take advantage."
"If someone wants to criticize that we have opened up a can of worms, well, they are right," he added. "Someone will eventually cross the line into something much more controversial. I hope it won't be us."

Hey, Pal, Want an Umbrella With That Newspaper?

BYLINE:  By DENNY LEE 

 BODY:
When you buy a $2 pack of batteries at the Sheridan Square newsstand, you're buying the most expensive non-reading-matter item a newsstand is allowed to sell. But that maximum price may go up. 
 The City Council passed a bill on Tuesday raising the cap on nonreading merchandise to $5, allowing newsstand operators to sell more expensive sundries like film and umbrellas. Robert Bookman, counsel to the New York City Newsstand Operators Association, a trade group, said the increase would help the city keep its newsstands. There are roughly 300 newsstands today, down from 1,580 in 1940. 
 A spokeswoman for the mayor's office, Lynn Rasic, said the mayor is expected to veto the bill next week because of a second provision that would allow newsstands to be owned by corporations as well as individuals.
But Councilwoman Karen Koslowitz said the provision was needed to make newsstands more economically viable. 
"It would help their industry not only survive," she said, "but possibly grow."

HEADLINE: ON POLITICS; 
Ah, That Spirit of Giving Lives On in the Legislature

BYLINE:  By David Kocieniewski; David Kocieniewski is Trenton bureau chief of The New York Times.

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
With all the bellowing about spiraling budget deficits and shrinking tax revenue emanating from New Jersey's State House these days, it might be logical to assume that your elected civil servants might attend to the treasury with a bit of austerity.
 But since when did logic have anything to do with the workings of New Jersey government? 
 As the legislative session lurches toward its conclusion on Jan. 7, and Acting Gov. Donald T. DiFrancesco prepares to leave office Jan. 8, elected officials from both parties are furiously trying to slip through an assortment of sweetheart bills before the lame duck session ends. 
The national economy may be in recession and the regional economy still reeling from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, but you can be assured that in Trenton this holiday season, the spirit of giving is in the air. Yet the recipients of that generosity are those you may not consider among the needy.
Take, for example, the Public Service Electric and Gas Company, New Jersey's largest utility, part of an energy conglomerate that last year posted $764 million in profits. Two years ago, the state enacted a deregulation plan that has brought consumers a marginal drop in utility costs, but offered power suppliers huge savings on debt run up by building inefficient nuclear and coal-fired plants in the 1970's and 80's.
Not to be outdone, this term the Legislature is trying to provide the utility with a $1 million annual tax credit, which the company says it is entitled to because it is building two power-generating plants in New Jersey. Consumer advocates say the bill, an amendment to a 1993 law enacted to reward companies that invest in New Jersey, is simply a thank you for the $381,000 in campaign contributions the company and its top executives have showered on lawmakers since the early 1990's.
Then there is the Somerset Hills School, a privately run academy for troubled teenagers. Assemblyman Richard Bagger is pushing legislation to bestow $1.5 million in taxpayer money on the school. According to state campaign finance records, the school and its owner contributed $254,000 to the Republican Party over the past decade. But the school's owner and Mr. Bagger both say the project is a worthy one and that the campaign contributions played no role in the decision.
Legislators were also sure to aim beneficence toward themselves.
A bill sponsored by State Senator Walter J. Kavanaugh, a Republican from Somerset, would fatten the pensions given to legislators who retire after 25 years of service. The rules, which Mr. Kavanaugh pushed through the Senate State Government Committe -- of which he is the chairman -- would immediately help two lawmakers: Ray Zane, a former Democrat who switched parties last year but then lost his re-election bid, and Mr. DiFrancesco, who served in the Legislature since 1976 and would qualify for the increased pension when he turns 60. Mr. Kavanaugh, who has held office since 1976, would also qualify, although he says he has no plans to retire.
Even some bills that appeared to target undeniably needy causes, like the beleaguered city of Camden, had expensive strings attached. State Senator Robert Littell, a Republican from rural Sussex County who will be leaving after the current session, showed an uncharacteristic interest in urban affairs this past month as he pressed for a $180 million economic assistance package for Camden, an overwhelmingly Democratic community on the other end of the state.
Tucked into the measure, however, was another spending plan: a $130 million initiative to rebuild an assortment of New Jersey dams, many of which are in Mr. Littell's district.
There were other proposals intended to steer taxpayer dollars to wineries and racehorse owners, plus requests for scores of pet projects by various towns, counties and villages. 
And while the vast majority of the proposals were sponsored by Republicans, who have a majority in both houses, Senator Bernard Kenny Jr., a Democrat, still managed to push for a last-minute proposal to lower taxes on corporations.
Since his election victory last month, Governor-elect Jim McGreevey has been incessantly warning that the state faces a mounting deficit and has pointedly urged lawmakers to restrain their spending. Mr. McGreevey has also apparently scuttled the expensive plans for Camden and for dam repairs, plus a proposal to finance an arena in downtown Newark. At least for now.
After Mr. McGreevey's inauguration on Jan 15, however, a new Legislature will convene with Mr. McGreevey's fellow Democrats in control of the General Assembly and in a 20-20 split with Republicans in the Senate. The unions, businesses and political leaders who helped propel Mr. McGreevey to victory will come calling and asking that their loyalty be rewarded with, at the very least, some attention to their concerns.
And when the next legislative session enters its lame duck period, and Democrats come seeking handouts for their pet projects, Mr. McGreevey will face a revealing test of his leadership -- when he shows whether he is willing to play Scrooge with members of his own party as well.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 6, 2002

 CORRECTION:
The On Politics column on Dec. 16, about the lame-duck session of the Legislature, misstated the plans of State Senator Robert Littell, a Republican from Sussex County. Mr. Littell, who won re-election last November, does not plan to step down at the end of the session.
The column also referred incorrectly to the support of State Senator Bernard F. Kenny Jr., a Democrat from Hoboken, for a corporate tax cut. While Mr. Kenny sponsored such a bill earlier in the session, he asked last month that it not be brought up for discussion because of concerns about the looming budget deficit.

HEADLINE: How Loud Does Money Talk? For Some, It Shouts 

BYLINE:  By VIVIAN MARINO 

 BODY:
WOULD you swallow a worm for $300 -- provided, of course, that you wouldn't become sick? How about shaving your head for $10,000? 
 While the very thought of doing either would make many people squirm, many others would rise to the occasion, for the right price, says Bernice Kanner, a New York writer, in her recent book, "Are You Normal About Money?" (Bloomberg Press, $12.95). 
 Of course, there is nothing "normal" about asking people to eat worms or to go around bald for cash, even a lot of it. But by asking hypothetical questions about money -- from the whimsical to the more serious -- the book provides a peek into the financial psyche of Americans. Call it a self-examination for people who wonder just how crazy they are about money, or a guide to whether other people share their opinions. 
The numbers are far from scientific. The bulk of the book, a 143-page paperback, is based in part on an informal survey conducted on the Web site of the Bloomberg media company over 18 months ending last summer. Some of the material was derived from existing data from other sources. Ms. Kanner said that she did not know exactly how many people had responded to the Bloomberg survey over all, but that each question drew 2,000 to 16,000 responses.
What surprised her most, she said, were "the incredible lengths that some people will go for money." For example, 21 percent of the respondents would wolf down that worm for $300, while 26 percent wouldn't touch it for less than $1,000. Fifty-nine percent, meanwhile, would eagerly shave their heads for $10,000.
"Your approach to money says more about you than probably any aspect of your personality," Ms. Kanner said. She acknowledged some fiscal idiosyncrasies herself, like reusing wrapping paper. (Fifty-seven percent of the respondents did the same.)
Jonathan Pond, a financial planner from Watertown, Mass., says attitudes about money are also affected by the state of the economy and personal income. "If you're unemployed and you don't know when your next meal is coming, you'd kiss a stranger for $200; if you don't need the money you probably won't," he said.
"Unfortunately, in this capitalistic society, money is the report card on how you're doing, and that's the problem a lot of people overseas have with our society."
Michael R. Bloomberg, the mayor-elect of New York and the founder of the media company, was among those who took the survey, according to Ms. Kanner. Calls to Mr. Bloomberg's aides at his transition office were not returned last week, so it was not known how he responded to all the questions, although his answer to this one is apparently clear: Is it wrong for a rich politician to spend his own money lavishly on an election? (Nearly two-thirds of the respondents thought it was O.K., too.)
Following are some of the other questions, and answers, that can be found in the book:

Views on Money
* What's more fun -- making money or spending it? Forty percent say making it, 22 percent say spending it, and the remainder enjoy both.
* How much extra money would it take to make a real difference in your life? One-third say $100,000; 14 percent, at least $500,000; 16 percent, $1 million; and 24 percent, $10 million.
* Would you rather personally strike it rich but have a nation at war, or enjoy peace without personal prosperity? Twelve percent would rather be rich and at war, 20 percent would rather be poor and have peace, and 68 percent would prefer to reach a compromise.

Penny-Pinching
* Do you take home the leftovers from a restaurant meal? Sixty-two percent say they do.
* Would you put back an item on a store shelf if you left your coupon for it home? Fifty-seven percent would forgo the purchase, while just 3 percent would return home to retrieve the coupon.

Investing
* Do you feel comfortable about your ability to earn back any money you lose? More than half say yes; 7 percent have significant doubts.
* What is the best way to get rich today? Of those earning at least $100,000 a year, 26 percent say starting a business; 22 percent, investing in stocks; and 15 percent, investing in real estate.
* Do you read the prospectus that comes with a mutual fund? Seventy-two percent never bother.
* How often do you check stock quotations? Forty-one percent say once a day; 18 percent, three times a day; 15 percent, more than three times a day; 10 percent, once a week; 5 percent, once a month; 10 percent, never.

Of Love and Money
* Do you know how much your spouse earns? Three out of 10 respondents say they don't.
* Who should pay on a date? Fifty-four percent say the man should pay, while 13 percent say the woman, provided that she earns more. Thirty-one percent say the couple should just split the bill. But if the woman does the inviting, two-thirds say she should pay.
* If you borrow money from a spouse, do you pay it back? Just 30 percent say they do.

Shopping Habits
* Do you buy store brands or pricier national ones? National brands are the winner, 85 percent to 15 percent.
* Do you set limits for holiday gifts? Fifty-seven percent say yes.
* Have you ever bought counterfeit goods, like a fake designer watch or handbag? Sixty-seven percent say no.
* Do you consider shopping fun? Seventy-nine percent of women do, while 74 percent of men don't.

Going to Extremes
* Have you ever switched tags to pay less in a store? Ten percent have engaged in such a practice.
* Would you take a three-month vow of silence for $20,000? Two-thirds would, if they could write down their thoughts.
* Would you commit a crime for $10 million if you knew you wouldn't be caught? Twenty-three percent would. But lower the amount to $100,000 and only 8 percent would.
* Would you spy for another country for a lot of money? Three-fourths wouldn't, but 15 percent would consider it, depending on the payoff.

Child Care: AnIndustry for All Economic Seasons

BYLINE:  By BARBARA WHITAKER 

 BODY:
EMPLOYERS are eliminating jobs around the country. The economy is officially declared to be in a recession. But child care businesses are expanding. 
 Institutional child care, born out of a profound shift in the labor force that began more than 30 years ago as more mothers went to work, has emerged as a surprisingly resilient industry in tougher times. 
 Professional, for-profit chains that care for children and preschoolers outside the home, such as KinderCare Learning Centers and Primrose Schools, are not growing at the fast pace of the 1980's. But these businesses also say they are not feeling much of an economic pinch -- at least not yet -- even in areas where many working parents have been laid off. 
Institutional child care experts say the industry's resistance to the ups and downs of the economic cycle has been strengthened by a growing acceptance of the value of early education and socialization for children. The high percentage of mothers in the labor force has also helped.
"We've had quite a few months into a fairly serious recession, and we don't see any letup in the number of centers," said Mike Wilson, owner and president of the Wilson Marketing Group, a consulting firm in Culver City, Calif., that specializes in child care services research. 
That does not mean the child care industry is totally insulated from national economic problems. It has always been challenged by low profit margins, constant staff turnover and heavy regulation, and it is bracing for higher insurance rates after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Moreover, moves by many states to offer public preschool education could reduce an important source of business.
"I think the child care industry is taking a very cautious approach right now," said Roger Neugebauer, publisher of Child Care Information Exchange, a trade journal based in Redmond, Wash., that has monitored the industry for 15 years. 
Mr. Neugebauer said that the largest for-profit child care chains had been projecting a growth rate of 5 to 7 percent for 2002, but that the estimate had been cut to 2 to 3 percent. 
The number of licensed child care centers has been increasing for a decade, to 111,506 in 2001 from 86,212 in 1992, according to the Children's Foundation, an advocacy group based in Washington that tracks those numbers. 
But there is much more room for growth in the market. Institutional child care, Mr. Wilson said, is now providing services to only roughly half of all American children aged 5 and younger who could theoretically enroll. "There's an awful lot of kids out there that could still be served," he said.
Some big chains are continuing to expand aggressively, assured of future business from corporate clients that offer subsidized child care as an employee benefit.
Bright Horizons Family Solutions, a Boston-based chain of employer-sponsored day care and early education centers with customers like Ford Motor, Merrill Lynch and Johns Hopkins University, opened 21 sites in the July-September quarter alone, a record for the company. 
Roger Brown, the chief executive of Bright Horizons, and his wife, Linda Mason, the chairwoman, founded the business 15 years ago. He said he expects to open 40 to 50 centers in 2002, compared with about 45 this year. The company, publicly held, reported a 23 percent increase in third-quarter earnings, to $2.3 million, on a 17 percent increase in revenue, to $87.2 million.
Others are expanding at a more modest pace. KinderCare, which is based in Portland, Ore., and is the nation's largest child care chain with 1,257 centers, plans to open 35 centers in its current fiscal year, which ends May 31, about the same as in the previous year. 
KinderCare, which expanded so aggressively in the 1980's that it faced debt problems in the recession of the early 1990's, is now far more stable financially. It was acquired in 1997 by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the investment firm.
Primrose Schools, a franchiser of day care and early education programs, said it had not wavered from a long-term expansion plan of 20 to 25 new centers a year. It now has 95.
"While I can't say we're recession-proof, child care is probably the second priority to parents after the mortgage," said Jo Kirchner, president and chief executive of Primrose, a subsidiary of the Security Capital Corporation, a conglomerate based in Greenwich, Conn., that also owns health insurance services and specialty retailing businesses. "In this slumping economy, what we're seeing is more women who might have chosen to leave careers going back to work."
Nearly 73 percent of mothers with children under 18 have jobs outside the home, Labor Department data show.
Ms. Kirchner said many Primrose clients tended to be professionals who, if laid off, pursued work elsewhere.
"They're educated," she said. "They know the importance of early childhood education. They will sacrifice to keep their children in school." 
For many child care businesses, the strength or weakness of the economy is of far less concern than a chronic inability to find and retain qualified educational professionals. The average annual salary in the child care industry is about $15,000.
"That to me is the biggest issue because if we can't attract bright, capable young people, how can you excel?" said Faith Wohl, president of the Child Care Action Campaign, a group based in New York that advocates changes in child care services.
For-profit child care centers are also becoming concerned about potential competition -- a trend among the states to offer prekindergarten programs themselves. The move could hurt or help the growth of preschools and day care centers -- depending on whether the states establish programs within the public schools or contract the work out.
ONLY Georgia offers prekindergarten universally to 4-year-olds, but New York is phasing in a program over seven years. Forty-three states have some form of state-financed prekindergarten programs in effect. 
"Economically, a center can't survive without that 4-year-old classroom," said Lynn White, executive director of the National Child Care Association, a trade organization based in Atlanta and representing about 7,000 private licensed child care centers. 
The labor in caring for an infant is much more intense than in the classrooms for 4-year-olds, which are among the more profitable age groups in institutional child care, she said. Infants may require one worker for every three or four babies, while a class of 4-year-olds may have an adult-to-child ratio of as high as 20 to 1. In a field where profit margins are about 4 percent and staffing typically accounts for 60 to 70 percent of a center's costs, a decline in the market for 4-year-olds can be worrisome.
"It's a very, very delicate economic situation that a child care center operates under," Ms. White said. "You take one component from it and it's a problem." 
For some child care businesses, the growing acceptance of dual-career households beyond the United States is an opportunity. Bright Horizons, which now operates more than 345 centers in 34 states, has expanded into Ireland and Britain and last month announced its first foray into Canada.
The company's international expansion is in some ways a circular route for Mr. Brown and his wife. They founded Bright Horizons in 1986 after returning from Sudan, where they had worked as managers for the Save the Children Foundation. 
"I often joke if I'd known more, I might not have done this," Mr. Brown said.

HEADLINE: COUNTERINTELLIGENCE; 
New Kit Bags, to Send Troubles Packing

BYLINE:  By Alex Witchel

 BODY:
THE Kate Spade store at 59 Thompson Street, near Broome, is tiny, only 300 square feet. So it's hard to ogle its owner without her noticing, though two teenage girls were recently giving it a go.
 "You feel a flutter, really?" one asked the other, who nodded mutely, the designer of her dreams at such close range. The questioner remained unconvinced. "I don't know," she said, surveying the diminutive Ms. Spade, who in turn fussed with a display, trying not to notice. "I feel a flutter for Laura Bush." 
 Well, to each her own, though Mrs. Bush's husband would certainly approve of Ms. Spade's newest venture: she has turned her original store -- the other, at 454 Broome, is at least three times larger -- into a travel boutique, stocking it with luggage, cosmetics cases, pajamas, journals and maps. 
That's right, despite forecasts by the travel industry of declines of up to 20 percent in flying from a year ago, Ms. Spade is convinced that the country will shake its travel phobia sooner rather than later. She and her husband, Andy Spade, the chief executive of Kate Spade L.L.C., came up with the travel concept well before the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center, but they believe it's still viable. They've also allotted space for it in their Chicago store.
"I'm not sure the idea has changed, though I'm curious to see whether or not the customer has," Ms. Spade said last week over lunch. "I think the question is, How long can we be held hostage by fear?"
For Ms. Spade the answer has been not one second. She and her husband were in Kansas City, Mo., her hometown, on Sept. 11, where she was scheduled to do a promotional event. She and Mr. Spade drove back to New York instead.
On the day the United States began the bombing of Afghanistan she was in Paris -- alone -- buying fabric. And the week that Gov. Gray Davis warned against using bridges in the San Francisco area, she was in town for a Kate Spade store event. But for her this kind of travel is the norm. She goes to Florence six times a year to supervise the manufacture of her handbag and shoe lines, to Japan twice a year to check in on the 5 Kate Spade stores and 13 in-store boutiques there, and twice a year to her stores in Boston and Chicago.
But unlike so many people who have traveled frequently since Sept. 11, she sports no macho bluster and readily admits she was most afraid when her husband flew to Arizona soon after the crash of American Airlines Flight 587 in Queens. "When you get that nervous, you almost have to resign yourself," she said. "But I think not flying would be worse." She smiled. "I realize that's also easier said than done."
Ms. Spade, 38, is best known, of course, for her stylishly simple handbags, which somehow escape being vulgar even though her name is sewn on the outside of each one. The effect is like Mom sewing name tapes on your camp clothes. And that homespun Midwestern quality has always been offset by the clean, modern design -- as if Audrey Hepburn had been raised in Kansas City. In recent years, the handbag line has been joined by stationery, shoes and eyeglasses. And travel.
"We thought of the idea after realizing we're suddenly surrounded by hotels," Ms. Spade said. "The Mercer, TriBeCa Grand, SoHo Grand and 60 Thompson Street, which is right across the street from us. And in its history, this store is where we try out experimental ideas."
After the original Kate Spade boutique outgrew the Thompson Street space, Ms. Spade first sold rare and vintage books there; then, more successfully, stationery. The travel incarnation is now three weeks old. "It's too early to say how we're doing," she said at Quilty's, a nearby restaurant, where she debated whether to take her leftover roast chicken home to her dog, Henry. (She didn't. No Kate Spade doggie bags?)
AT the table, Ms. Spade's posture is ramrod straight, her manners are impeccable and her upturned nose, rosy cheeks and pulled-back hair conjure images of Mary Poppins, known more for what was in her magical bag than for the bag itself. But unlike the often forbidding nanny, Ms. Spade has an easy way about her, and a warm, comfortable laugh. It's not surprising to learn from one of her employees that the company's orientation materials stipulate saying please and thank you -- in the office, not just the stores.
Ms. Spade reached for her black bag, a sample from the spring line that tantalizingly called to mind a big, fat Tootsie Roll. She gamely opened it for inspection.
"Isn't it fun?" she said, which in fashionspeak beats "Isn't it divine?" any day, though a case could be made that this actually was. The lining was bright red fabric, and crammed inside were Ms. Spade's passport (she had gotten back from Florence the night before), a pen, a half-eaten candy cane wrapped in plastic, a cellphone, lipstick, a fistful of lire, sunglasses and some phone messages from the hotel.
The effect was part glamour, part girl next door, just like the company. Its success -- annual sales have grown to $70 million this year, from $10 million in 1996 -- has been due, Ms. Spade says, to her and Mr. Spade's insistence on not expanding too quickly. In 1998, the company hired away the president of Donna Karan, whose push to build resulted in his leaving within three months. Since 1999, when Neiman Marcus became the majority owner in Kate Spade, nothing has changed internally, Ms. Spade said; Neiman functions as a financial and distribution resource.
That kind of security has come in handy during the downturn all retail businesses have suffered since Sept. 11. Both Kate Spade stores in SoHo were closed for a week. But it would seem that bad times can be good times for Ms. Spade's business. The company was founded in 1993, during the last recession. "Well, it's not deliberate," she said carefully. "But if we can do something under the radar, that is good for us. When we started up we had the great luxury of being slow and small for a couple of years, which allowed us to learn and grow. Also, when it's quiet, we can sense what sells, and when things get better we'll know what people have been responding to."
The feedback so far is good. Michelle Kessler Sanders, the accessories director for Vogue, said: "It's patriotic to plow ahead and try this, instead of turning the space into yet another bag shop. New Yorkers do travel -- that's what our lives are like. And beautiful luggage does get overlooked in our accessories world. But with Kate's stuff you get a great-looking piece for a great price. With a Louis Vuitton steamer trunk, who knows if you'll ever see it again?"
For Ms. Spade, the Christmas holiday is just another opportunity to travel. She's off to Jackson Hole to ski with Mr. Spade's family. (His brother David is the comic actor.) She saw her own family at Thanksgiving; the fifth of six children, she has four sisters, one brother, a sister-in-law, two parents and a stepmother. Her parents divorced when she was 8.
"I told my sister that I wasn't going to send bags to everyone at Christmas this year because it didn't seem like a gift I put a lot of effort into," Ms. Spade recalled. "I said, 'It's not very sincere to just go through the inventory and send them out.' " She laughed. "And my sister said: 'No, no -- be insincere. We want them, it's O.K.' "
All things considered, Ms. Spade is being generous; she still remembers pining for a raspberry-pink velvet dress with a matching pink velvet purse as a child. "When it came in, it wasn't my size anymore, so my mother gave it to my sister," she said. "I got the purse and remember thinking, 'You never grow out of the purse.' "
After lunch, she returned to the store, where business was brisk. The two teenage girls ogled her, then bought wallets and boxes of Eleni's cookies in the shape of Kate Spade handbags.
"My grandmother just bought this whole line of luggage," one of the girls said, pointing to a brightly striped set. "She said it's the only one she can see on the belt."
Sunglasses, a cashmere pillow, a cashmere scarf and a cosmetics bag made it out the door in minutes, though no one picked up on the conversion charts for shoes and clothes in European sizes or the vintage copy of "I Married Adventure" by Osa Johnson. The Kate Spade travel kits, outfitted with disposable cameras, eye masks, mints, playing cards, Woolite and Q-Tips, won't be in stock until January.
Ms. Spade raced around a while helping customers and answering the phone. But finally her jet lag triumphed, and she sat slumped under a map of Europe. At that moment, she seemed so small and so tired, it was almost too much to imagine what the store might look like in the slog of January.
Then again, she was only tired, not crazy. Like any savvy businesswoman, this one has hedged her bets. Her latest endeavor? Kate Spade Home.

HEADLINE: A Harvard Shopping Guide? Charge It 

BYLINE:  By ELLEN TIEN 

 BODY:
EVEN the most experienced shopper enjoys thumbing through a Zagat or Berlitz shopping guide every now and then, in the hopes of picking up a retail tip.
 So, when I came upon an advance copy of "The Harvard Design School Guide to Shopping" (Taschen, March 2002), overseen by the architect Rem Koolhaas, I felt a flicker of anticipation. Eight hundred pages of armchair browsing! A wealth of department store secrets in a glossy tome the size of a Prada men's shoe box! Charge! 
 Don't be fooled by the title. Nowhere in its 800 pages did this weighty manual tell me where to get the best deal on tie-dyed chinchilla or when to reserve my Paris tickets for Porthault's midwinter whites sale. In fact, the book is not really about shopping at all -- at least, not in the True Shopper's pleasure-drenched sense of the word. Rather, it solemnly explores the social psychology and calculus of the Great American Pastime: how the evolution of retail shapes our culture, defines our cities and infiltrates our lives. In short, it looks at the chill behind the thrill. And then, in subliminal Socratic Method, it asks the inveterate consumer: What do you have to say for yourself?
The product of graduate-level thesis research directed by Mr. Koolhaas, who is a Harvard professor (Dutch designers are very big right now), the "Guide to Shopping" juxtaposes gorgeous graphics, charts and statistics with erudite essays on such retail groundbreakers as the air-conditioner and escalator. Mr. Koolhaas and company use precise modernist math to harness rampant mall lust, and in doing so, create their own super-controlled environment. To put it in Dutch design terms: Gerrit Rietveld wrestles Viktor & Rolf to the ground.
For all its density, the book is remarkably readable. A good thing, since career shoppers are not always known for their reading comprehension skills (I mean, how many times have I heard a customer in Saks inquire, "On what floor is the Cafe on Seven located?"). With no major text appearing until Page 93, it opens with a glut of statistics: the United States has 31 square feet of retail area per person (as opposed to four square feet per person in Europe and two in Asia). Wal-Mart sales are larger than the gross domestic product of three-quarters of the world's national economies. 
It documents how consumerism has infected every living space, from hospitals (consider Rhode Island's proposed Medical City, a $267 million hospital with a six-story atrium, a waterfall and retail shops) to the military (witness the Norfolk Naval Base's plans to become a theme park with aircraft carriers). Further, it explores the spooky concept of "captive shopping," as seen in airport and train station malls.
To be sure, this is less the book for a person who adores shopping, and more for one who is wont to study the pseudopathology of such behavior. The kind of person who has greater interest in the Manhattan Project than the Gotham Salad at Bergdorf -- and who might have nodded emphatically when Newton Minow declared television a "vast wasteland." To wit, "The Harvard Design School Guide to Shopping" is for the lepidopterist, not the butterfly.
In other words, the perfect gift for a butterfly to run out and buy for all her lepidopterist friends.

As Winter Looms, Advocates for the Homeless Raise the Alarm

BYLINE:  By ERIKA KINETZ 

 BODY:
Last week, a 105-bed shelter for homeless men opened on East 123rd Street in Harlem. But advocates for the homeless say this apparently good news is not good enough. The city, they say, still has not done enough to prepare for the surge in demand for shelter that winter brings. 
 The surge may already be starting. On Thursday night, Francis Griffiths, 48, reaching into a trash bin near Bellevue Hospital for a piece of cake, said he had first sought shelter more than a week ago. "It's getting cold," Mr. Griffiths, who has been homeless for five years, said in a soft, slow voice. 
 Patrick Markee, a senior policy analyst for the Coalition for the Homeless, said Mr. Griffiths was one of hundreds of men the city might not be able to house adequately this winter. Since 1996, Mr. Markee said, the cold weather has driven an average of an additional 450 adults to homeless shelters each year. But, he said, the city is adding only 233 beds, including the new East Harlem shelter, for homeless men this winter. 
Furthermore, Mr. Markee said, the need may be greater this year because of the softening economy and increasing unemployment. The men's shelters are already full, he added, citing the city's need on Tuesday to put eight emergency beds at a men's shelter on Wards Island to meet demand.
But Bob Mascali, first deputy commissioner of the Department of Homeless Services, said the city was prepared for the winter. 
"We've never turned away anyone," he said, adding that full shelters may reflect heightened outreach work. "We have eight outreach teams out there practically around the clock to bring people in." 
The city also calculates a smaller need for beds than the coalition does. The Department of Homeless Services figures that the winter increase in demand has averaged only 322 a year in the last five years. Furthermore, said Mr. Mascali, in addition to the 233 new shelter beds, the city has increased the number of temporary folding beds by 90, bringing the total of emergency beds past 300.
But Mr. Markee says that under the terms of a 1981 consent decree, such beds can only be used during severe weather emergencies. "That's not meant to be a day-to-day remedy for a seasonal rise in demand for shelter," he said.
Mr. Mascali responded that the emergency beds were "a legal and appropriate method of dealing with occasional spikes in the shelter census." 
"Right now we feel that what we're putting on line will be sufficient, but we will also monitor the situation carefully," he added. "We're looking for additional capacity if necessary."
Local resistance can make that search difficult. "These people are not from our community," said David Givens, the chairman of Community Board 11 in East Harlem, referring to the 123rd Street shelter and other social welfare centers in the neighborhood. "How can we ever encourage development or tourism when you allow our community to be a dumping ground?" According to the Coalition for the Homeless, East Harlem and Wards Island now have 1,258 beds for homeless adults and space for about 100 families.
Still, Mr. Markee said, stuffed shelters present human as well as legal problems. "Once you start approaching capacity, there's back flow," he said. "The people at the front door end up suffering long waits or they end up getting bounced around from night to night."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: EAST VILLAGE -- BUZZ; 
Fighting for Truth, Justice And Fair Rental Practices

BYLINE:  By DENNY LEE 

 BODY:
THE SETTING -- The theatrical premiere of "Rent Wars Ronin," a full-color anime film in which the city's tenant-landlord skirmishes are recast in the fantasy of Dungeons and Dragons. In this pixel-generated world, knighted tenants and "Barracudi" lawyers possess kung fu powers to duel with the likes of Chief Judge Sleazy and Slimy Slumlord.
 Word of the premiere had spread through tenant circles like new rent regulations. At 6:30 p.m. on Tuesday, combatants in real rental wars began filing into the Anthology Film Archives in the East Village. 

THE BUZZ -- "We all dream when we go into court and defend our clients, that we are really some superhero," said Brooke Davis, 30, a tenant lawyer with the Brooklyn Neighborhood Office of the Legal Aid Society.
As several dozen people milled in the lobby, waiting for the box office to open, the creator of the film, Ronin Amano, came bursting through the door with the videotape and bad news. Two-thirds of the film had been corrupted by a software meltdown that morning, said Mr. Amano, a burly paralegal from Park Slope, Brooklyn. So the audiences would get only a "taste."
Disappointment rolled over people's faces, but most paid the $10 admission anyway. They understood this to be a labor of love, scraped together from a secondhand computer and volunteer actors.
After a 30-minute film about the making of "Rent Wars Ronin," the 10-minute clip was shown. "There is a war in progress," the voice-over warned. "For the sake of evil, the Slumlords twist the law to cause agony and despair. But there is at least one tenant who can fight back. One, Ronin."
The animation fell far below Disney standards and the original score had a Nintendo flavor, but the audience didn't care. When Ronin says to himself (as superheroes often do), "But bribes go a long way in the D.H.C.R.," the audience was in stitches at the joke, an allusion to the state's Division of Housing and Community Renewal.
Potato chips and cheese were served afterward, but the audience was hungry to see more of the film. 
"It's a great concept," said David Powell, 29, a tenant organizer with the Metropolitan Council on Housing, an advocacy group. "It's good to see the age-old struggle between the landed and landless connected to the reality of New York tenants."
Others felt soothed by what they had seen.
"It makes you feel like you have an ally," said Yarrow Regan, 44, an unemployed bookkeeper who is in a protracted dispute with her landlord in Queens. "This should be shown in housing court, in the children's room." 
Mr. Amano, who stayed up all night finishing the film, only to see his work evaporate, reassured fans that the work could be salvaged from his hard drive. The plan, he said, is to show "Rent Wars Ronin" in full in February on his cable show, "Rent Wars."

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH/Michael T. Kennedy; 
Stein Roe Intermediate Bond Fund

BYLINE:  By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
THE chance that corporations will default on their bond payments is high because of the recession, but investors are being well paid for taking on the risk, said Michael T. Kennedy, who runs the $652 million Stein Roe Intermediate Bond fund.
 "From a valuation perspective, the difference in yield between corporate bonds and Treasuries is at a historically wide point," Mr. Kennedy said from his office in downtown Chicago. Currently, 10-year United States Treasury bonds yield 5.1 percent, compared with 6.6 percent for corporate bonds rated A. That yield spread, 1.5 percentage points, compares with a more typical spread of 0.9 points, he added. 
 "We are more than compensated for the risk of credit-quality deterioration with extra yield," Mr. Kennedy said. "And we think the economy will bounce back in 2002, which means earnings will grow and credit quality will improve."
The fund returned 6.8 percent a year, on average, for the three years through Thursday, compared with 4.9 percent for its intermediate-bond fund group, according to Morningstar Inc. It returned 9.3 percent in the last 12 months, versus 7.8 percent for its group, Morningstar said.
Mr. Kennedy, 39, is a senior vice president of the fund's adviser, Stein Roe & Farnham in Chicago. He picks most of the fund's 100 or so bonds from among issues rated investment grade by Standard & Poor's and BB, the highest grade of junk bonds, also called high-yield bonds.
Typically, he invests 10 percent of the fund's assets in United States Treasuries and 60 percent in corporate bonds. Today, the Treasury stake is just 2 percent, while corporate bonds account for nearly 80 percent of assets. Junk bonds account for 14 percent of the portfolio, up from a typical level of 10 percent but still below the 20 percent permitted in the fund's charter. While 20 percent of the bonds are issued by companies outside the United States, all are denominated in dollars. 
A month ago, $3.65 million in bonds issued by Enron accounted for 0.5 percent of the fund's assets. Enron has since collapsed amid questions about its accounting practices, and the bonds have lost 80 percent of their value -- about $2.92 million. Because of the loss, they account for just 0.1 percent of fund assets today, Mr. Kennedy said. Like many other money managers, Mr. Kennedy was surprised by the extent of the company's problems.
When choosing bonds, Mr. Kennedy focuses on industries that he believes will perform well, given his economic forecast. Currently, he is focusing on the banking, finance and automobile industries.
Next, he reviews company financial statements, looking closely at earnings trends and multiples of debt to cash flow and debt to total capitalization. "These help us to judge the company's ability to repay its debt," he said.
Mr. Kennedy calls himself a sector rotator, moving among different classes of bonds as well as among issues of the same class. That strategy created a relatively high annual turnover rate, 356 percent, in 2000. Even so, the fund's expenses averaged 0.72 percent of assets last year, less than the 0.99 percent average for the intermediate-bond group, Morningstar said.
The average duration of the fund's bonds is now 4.8 years, slightly longer than usual, Mr. Kennedy said, to better lock in yields. That compares with an average duration of 4.2 years for the intermediate bond group, Morningstar said.
In September, Mr. Kennedy bought 10-year bonds issued by General Motors, paying $99.699 for each $100 worth. They closed on Friday at $95.585. The bonds are investment grade, rated BBB+ by Standard & Poor's; their coupon rate is 6.875 percent. He said that G.M. was cutting costs to improve its balance sheet and that the auto industry outlook should improve in the next 12 to 18 months.
IN July, he bought bonds issued by First Massachusetts Bank, with a 7.625 percent coupon and due June 2011, at $103.76. On Friday, they closed at $104.349. First Massachusetts is an affiliate of the Banknorth Group of Portland, Me.
S.& P. rates the First Massachusetts bonds BBB, the lowest investment-grade rating. "We think the agency rated the bonds too low," Mr. Kennedy said. First Massachusetts has strong earnings growth and a solid balance sheet, he said.
In June, Mr. Kennedy bought bonds of the La Quinta Companies, due August 2004, at $94.55; they closed on Friday at $97. The coupon rate is 7.114 percent, and S.& P. rates them BB, the top junk grade. The La Quinta hotel chain, based in Dallas, was acquired in 1998 by the Meditrust Companies, a financier of real estate related to health care. After management recognized that its diversification strategy was not working, Mr. Kennedy said, it sold health care assets and is using the proceeds to pay down debt.
"What's left is La Quinta, which we expect will be acquired by some bigger hotel chain," Mr. Kennedy said. "If not, we have a solid hotel company."

He notes that the gap in yields between corporate bonds and Treasury issues is much wider than usual.

NestEggs Have Shrunk. But Tuition Bills Haven't.

BYLINE:  By SANA SIWOLOP 

 BODY:
JO-ANN AND CHRISTOPHER DAVIS of Haddonfield, N.J., spent the first years of their marriage building up their electrical contracting business. It was not until about six years ago that they could start putting away college money for their six children, now 9 to 18 years old.
 Mrs. Davis, 41, is on the interviewing committee for applicants at her alma mater, Georgetown University, so she knew that college would be an expensive proposition for her family. Its grocery bills alone run $1,200 a month. 
 Lately, the Davises have been feeling especially under pressure. Like millions of other people, they have watched the volatile stock market lop off a big chunk of their college nest egg, which was invested in six mutual fund accounts, one for each child. As of last week, the values of the four accounts that had not been cashed in were down about 40 percent from their peaks. 
To make matters worse, college tuition continues to rise faster than inflation. In an annual survey released in October, the College Board found that the average in-state tuition and other fees for public four-year colleges rose 7.7 percent this year, to $3,754 a year, while tuition and fees at four-year private colleges rose 5.5 percent, to $17,123 a year.
To meet those rising expenses, the Davises, like many other families, are aggressively seeking financial aid. Their oldest child, Lauren, entered St. Joseph's University in Philadelphia in September with a $16,000 academic scholarship as well as an $8,000 work-study grant for all four years. In addition, she has taken out $28,000 in federal and college loans.
The College Board survey found that a record $74.4 billion in aid -- in the form of grants, loans and work-study jobs -- was available to students and their families this fall, an increase of more than 7 percent from last year. Still, some parents have been liquidating retirement accounts or even pulling their children out of schools, according to financial planners.
"Most lower-income families are still going to get a lot of financial aid," said Raymond D. Loewe, the president of College Money, a firm in Marlton, N.J., that helps parents plan for college expenses. "But a lot of wealthier parents, like those who are midlevel executives, are panicking -- they thought that they had it all figured out."
Mr. Loewe said that instead of cashing in their stock investments, a growing number of his clients who might not be eligible for direct financial aid were turning to loans offered by the federal Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students program, better known as PLUS. The loans let parents borrow up to all the cost of a college education, with no collateral. The current interest rate is 6.79 percent, the lowest since 1994.
For students, the most widely used plan is the low-interest, federal Stafford Loan program. Eligibility is determined by the school's financial aid office. In the subsidized version of these loans, based on need, the government pays the interest while students are in school. In the unsubsidized version, students pay all the interest, although they can defer payment until after graduation. The current rate is 5.39 percent.
Many colleges have their own low-interest loans for incoming and continuing students, Mr. Loewe noted. Students who are already enrolled when they run into financial problems should inquire at their schools' financial aid offices about retention loans and grants, he said.
These loans are usually for $1,000 to $7,000 and are most often offered by medium-priced private colleges and universities. 
"These are the schools that tend to be struggling because they don't have as many applicants as the state schools or the Ivy Leagues," Mr. Loewe said, adding that such schools often found it less expensive to keep good students than to bring in new ones.
College financial planners are also urging parents to be more flexible in choosing schools.
"Most parents naively assume that public schools will save them money," said Milton E. Eisenhardt, the director of counseling services at College Money. "But too often they're focusing just on tuition costs. Private colleges are doing some very creative things when it comes to money for students. And a small private college may actually pay more attention to moving a student through the system so that they graduate in four years instead of six."
Michael A. Tedesco, a counselor at New Rochelle High School in New York, said college-bound students in his area were increasingly looking at "solid, non-Ivy League schools where they can get good and, in some cases, great financial packages."
Mr. Tedesco, who is also a part-time adviser for college financial aid, said he had noticed such packages lately at schools like Case Western Reserve, Emory, Vanderbilt, Carnegie Mellon and the University of Rochester. Rochester offers $5,000 scholarships to residents of New York State, as well as $5,000 scholarships to students who have SAT scores of 1,350 or more.
Although tuition keeps climbing at most colleges, some have actually reduced their costs. Examples are on the Web site of the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, which tracks its more than 900 members (www.naicu.edu). Based on a recent informal survey, the association found four colleges that charge no tuition at all (Cooper Union in New York is one), three that have recently reduced tuition and almost three dozen that have either frozen tuition for the 2001-02 year or have kept their recent tuition increases below the national average.
This fall, Bethany College in Bethany, W. Va., announced one of the largest tuition cuts ever reported by a private college: it is cutting tuition for its incoming freshmen next fall by 42 percent, to $12,000 from $20,650. Almost three-quarters of Bethany's students come from West Virginia, Ohio or Pennsylvania; the reductions were made in response to the weaker economy in those states, but also because they help make the school stand out, said Brian C. Ralph, a vice president for enrollment management and marketing.
"We felt that many students weren't even giving our school a look because of price," Mr. Ralph said.
(He added that many continuing students would receive financial aid, including scholarships, grants and merit awards, to offset their higher tuition.)
Since the plan was announced, the number of new applicants to Bethany has jumped 33 percent, he said; to make up for the lower tuition income per student, Bethany plans to increase the size of its next freshman class by 14 percent.
Elsewhere, officials report rising interest in colleges that offer a fifth year of tuition free -- in most cases so that students can finish accelerated master's degree programs. That means that the students can essentially receive two degrees for the price of one.
At Clark University in Worcester, Mass., David P. Angel, the dean of the graduate school, said 15 percent of Clark students were taking advantage of the school's "fifth year free" program.
Persistence appears to be more important than ever in seeking help with college costs. Mr. Tedesco said he knew of a father who was able to get an extra $10,000 in financial aid for his daughter after he wrote a courteous letter to the school, explaining that his business was about to go under and detailing the family's monthly budget.
Joan Winer Brown, 56, a widowed mother of three who lives in New Rochelle and works for a nonprofit group in Manhattan, used a written appeal to get more financial aid for her daughter Alice, 21, a senior at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst who is spending this semester at McGill University in Montreal.
MRS. DAVIS is learning the ropes as well. After spending $4,000 last summer just to set up her daughter Lauren with college needs like a computer, she decided to establish a simple savings account for such future expenses. She now deposits $50 a week into that account.
"It's not much money," she said. "But I didn't prepare for my first child like I'm going to prepare for the next few children."
Early preparation may be more important than ever, though financial planners say most parents still wait until the last minute.
Mr. Eisenhardt, for example, said 70 percent of the parents who came to him for advice had children who were already seniors in high school.
"The biggest problem I have in this business is that parents tend to deny that they'll have to pay for college until the end of a student's junior year," he said. "My ideal parent would be the one who is in a maternity ward."

HEADLINE: A Venture In Ships Is a RareZell Flop 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE WAYNE 

 BODY:
SAM ZELL may have the Midas touch when it comes to investing in real estate. But his efforts on the high seas -- with cruise ships -- have ended in a debacle that has cost him over $100 million and taxpayers at least three times that.
 Mr. Zell is the chairman and largest shareholder of American Classic Voyages, which filed for bankruptcy protection in October. This came after the failure of an ambitious project by Mr. Zell to build two 1,900-passenger cruise ships, the first that were to be constructed in this country in 40 years. It also came despite a boatload of government aid to Mr. Zell, including $1.08 billion in federal loan guarantees. 
 When it came to playing the Washington game, Mr. Zell walked away a big winner in the mid-1990's. His cruise ship plan -- called Project America -- wrapped up patriotism and politics and allowed him to construct his two huge ships by putting government money, not his, at risk. He also secured a 30-year monopoly on all cruise-ship traffic within the Hawaiian islands.
Helping him get this sweet deal were Senator Trent Lott, the Republican minority leader, who wanted to land a big project for the Ingalls shipyard in his home state of Mississippi, and Senator Daniel K. Inouye, the Hawaii Democrat, who engineered the exclusivity pact. Mr. Zell's ships, American-made and with American crews, would be the only ones allowed to sail port-to-port within Hawaii; others must stop at foreign ports first, eating up time.
"Obviously, I lost a lot of money," Mr. Zell said. "Everyone talks about the taxpayer losses. But they never mention the fact that others lost significant amounts of money as well. Shareholders lost a lot of money, and that's very unfortunate."
Last year, with American Classic shares trading at $36, Mr. Zell's 3.8 million shares were worth $137 million. This fall, the shares were delisted from Nasdaq when they were trading at 45 cents, chopping Mr. Zell's stake to $1.7 million. The government, meanwhile, is looking at losses of $367 million from American Classic, which also operates four paddlewheel steamboats through its Delta Queen Steamboat subsidiary.
The failure has incurred the wrath of Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who called for an investigation, which the inspector general of the Transportation Department has undertaken.
Rob Freeman, a staff member of the Senate Commerce Committee, where Mr. McCain is the ranking Republican, said: "It was a bad idea. The taxpayer took all the risk."
Mr. Zell got such government largess by being the right person in the right place when the United States Maritime Administration wanted to revive the domestic shipbuilding industry, which had been beaten down by lower-cost foreign competitors. Without aid, American Classic executives say, their project would never have gotten off the ground. 
"We were supposed to be promoting shipbuilding," said a former top Maritime Administration official, who insisted on anonymity. "Inouye and the whole state wanted to grow the cruise business. The maritime trade unions wanted jobs. So there was a lot of political support."
MR. ZELL never lobbied the administration directly; his top executives did. In 1996 and 1997, American Classic executives met with members of Congress, labor leaders and shipyard owners in an all-out effort to promote the project in Washington. That effort was backed by campaign contributions from Mr. Zell and American Classic to Mr. Lott, Mr. Inouye and other crucial members of Congress.
It paid off. The $1.08 billion loan guarantee was the largest the Maritime Administration had ever approved, and it allowed American Classic to enter debt markets that would otherwise be closed to it -- and at rates comparable to government debt. American Classic was also allowed to buy an old foreign-made ship and use it for Hawaii cruises while the two new ships were under construction, giving the company an exemption from a law prohibiting foreign carriers from that route.
But the souring economic picture of 2001 halted these ambitions. By last summer, the company had cash-flow problems, and the downturn in tourism after the terrorist attacks pushed it over the edge. "Sept. 11 just put it away," Mr. Zell said.

To the Editor:
Re "Radicalism: Is the Devil in the Demographics?" (Week in Review, Dec. 9):
 America's war on terrorism is being waged in the military and propaganda spheres. 
We have to extend it into the educational and economic arena. What is needed are conditional grants to the overpopulated Arab and Islamic countries to help them develop agricultural and light-industrial projects away from urban centers to create employment, especially for youths. 
 Grants could also provide for schooling beyond the madrasas, concentrating mostly on primary education and on developing teachers who would teach the Koran without the revolutionary input. 
The billions of dollars needed could be pooled from the United States and its Western allies and administered by the United Nations. Money so spent would reduce high birth rates, alleviate unemployment and help us avoid future wars.

HEADLINE: This Separate Season 

 BODY:
The patterns that shape the December holiday season are so familiar to most Americans that even the slightest variation makes one year's version of Noel or Hanukkah seem strikingly different from another's. Much snow or little snow, more prosperity or less, "It's a Wonderful Life" or "The Bishop's Wife" -- these things make an enormous difference in what matters most of all, which is how the season feels. If it seems odd, some years, that so much should depend on the emotions these few weeks arouse, in other years it seems entirely natural, a fitting indulgence of what is often the very best we know about ourselves. 
 This year no one really knows just how the holidays should seem. Nothing could be more welcome than to cross into the fullness, the separateness of this season the way Harry Potter and Hagrid stepped into Diagon Alley. The streets of New York are full of people looking for the right way to do that, the combination of weather and music, of parties and gift-giving needed to usher them into some semblance of the proper spirit. The distractions are innumerable, and many of them, like the war in Afghanistan, are not really distractions at all, but the proper focus of our attention. 
 This December brings with it a kind of self-consciousness, too. In part, it's the self-awareness of consumers who know that a recession is on, that retail sales declined steeply in November and that our sense of economic equilibrium will depend in part on how good the December numbers are. But you can also see self-consciousness in the decorations this year, and not only in the fact that the colors have shifted from green and red to red, white and blue. The Christmas lights are blazing in small towns and on rural houses as they never have before. Porches and rooftops, set aglow at night, seem to be speaking aloud to passers-by, making a hortatory point about something larger even than the good cheer of Christmas.
Somehow we always stumble into this season, never quite prepared, more than a little skeptical the first time someone mentions "the meaning of Christmas." It has gathered so many meanings over the years. But it seems certain that the way we honor the holidays in this extraordinary year will add something abiding to our sense of what these dark winter weeks, when the days are so short, will mean to us in the future. Even this late, it's still hard to say just what that something might be. 
But it will have little to do with the volume of retail sales or the uncertainty that still worries air travelers making their way home for the holidays. Many Americans are finding that the familiar touchstones of this season have a different resonance than they did in past years. That may be, in part, because of the stress we have all felt for the last three months. But it may also be because we have nearly all of us been led to a new understanding of the claims our emotions make upon us and what those claims signify about our relation to the world. We know we need to bring something new to our celebration of this season, and we are still learning how.

Breaking the Benchmarks, in Reverse

BYLINE:  By SHERRI DAY 

 BODY:
Stocks slipped back below some benchmark numbers this week, leaving investors to ponder whether the market in general, and the technology sector in particular, had come too far too fast.
 The Federal Reserve's decision on Tuesday to cut short-term interest rates by one-quarter of a percentage point received a muted reaction on Wall Street. 
But the statement accompanying the rate cut offered little to support the market's hope for a speedy recovery. While the bank said some signs of economic weakness appeared to be abating, it said the evidence was preliminary, leaving room to cut rates again in January. 
 A spate of earnings warnings from companies like Ciena, Lucent Technologies and Merck further dampened investor sentiment. 
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 238.31 points, or 2.37 percent, falling below the 10,000 level to 9,811.15. The Nasdaq composite index fell 68.09 points, or 3.4 percent, dropping below 2,000 to 1,953.17. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 35.22 points, or 3.0 percent, to 1,123.09.
 Bond prices fell, pushing up yields. The yield on the benchmark 10-year note rose to 5.18 percent from 5.16 percent. SHERRI DAY

Of Patriotism and Real Trees

BYLINE:  By Vivian Marino 

 BODY:
The holiday season is shaping up as a disappointment for American retailers, many of whom say their sales have been affected by the weak economy and the terrorist attacks. But those factors, it seems, may actually help one group of merchants -- sellers of natural Christmas trees. 
 "The reduced travel and increase in spirituality and family activities in America will prompt more consumers to choose a real Christmas tree this year," said Jim Corliss, the president of the National Christmas Tree Association, a trade group based in St. Louis. 
 Mr. Corliss, who also runs Piper Mountain Christmas Trees in Newburgh, Me., said a preseason poll had projected that 32.3 million families would buy real trees this year, up from 32.1 million last year. Based on sales so far, he said, "I'm a bit more optimistic than that and expect sales to reach 35 million trees."
The trade group said a good harvest in most parts of the country would mean plentiful supplies and only modest prices increases from last year. Vivian Marino

Money Market Yields Plunge

BYLINE:  Compiled by Jeff Sommer 

 BODY:
Average yields on money market funds plunged to their lowest levels ever last week, with yields on tax-free funds dropping below 1 percent, but investors have been pouring money in anyway, according to iMoneyNet Inc. of Westborough, Mass.
 The organization, which tracks the funds, said they had taken in more than $230 billion of new cash in the last three months, despite minuscule yields. 
The average compound yield for taxable funds fell to 1.73 percent from 1.84 percent for the week ending Dec. 11, iMoneyNet said. The average compound yield for tax-free funds fell to 0.94 percent from 1.2 percent. 
 Repeated cuts in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve have lowered the money market yields, which are expected to continue to decline.

HEADLINE: Europe Agrees To a Review Of Changes For Its Union 

BYLINE:  By SUZANNE DALEY 

DATELINE: LAEKEN, Belgium, Dec. 15 

 BODY:
European Union leaders, who for months have been engaged in a sometimes strained debate about the future of the union, have agreed to set up a constitutional convention to review its institutions.
 The goal of the convention is to make the 15-member organization, which expects to admit as many as 12 new members in the next few years, more efficient, more democratic and more understandable to the average citizen. 
 Belgium's prime minister, Guy Verhofstadt, who currently holds the rotating presidency of the European Union, said that its leaders had agreed that the convention would be allowed to study a full range of issues -- from whether the leader of the European Commission, the administrative arm of the union, should be an elected official to the need for a European constitution.
"There are no more taboos," Mr. Verhofstadt said, adding that the convention would be a way of bringing a discussion of the European Union's strengths and weaknesses "into the open air for the first time." 
Past reform efforts have been decided by small groups of officials and politicians. But the yearlong convention is likely to be Europe's biggest consultation exercise, with more than 100 participants, including union leaders and academics.
The reform process was set in motion last year at the Nice summit meeting, which was supposed to result in a major overhaul of the way decisions are made, streamlining and improving them. But it is widely agreed that the Nice treaty fell far short of that goal. At the time, having negotiated far beyond the allotted time, the European leaders decided to go home and revisit the issue later.
The most fundamental divide between them is whether the union will move toward a more federalist model. Among those pushing for that is Germany, which would probably increase its power under a more democratic federalist system. In the complex voting system now in place, it is underrepresented, given the size of its population.
But President Jacques Chirac of France and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain argue vehemently that the union must remain an organization of "states united," not a "united states."
Early drafts of the declaration calling for the convention were rejected for sounding too much in favor of a federalist system. The latest draft says that Europe stands "at a crossroads, a defining moment in its existence" and adds that a way must be found to bring the bloc closer to the people, especially the young.
"Citizens are calling for a clear, open, effective, democratically controlled community approach, developing a Europe that points the way ahead for the world," it says. "An approach that provides concrete results in terms of more jobs, better quality of life, less crime, decent education and better health care. There can be no doubt that this will require Europe to undergo renewals and reform."
Mr. Verhofstadt announced that former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing of France, 75, would be the president of the convention. The vice presidents are to be former Prime Minister Giuliano Amato of Italy, 63, and former Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene of Belgium, 61.
Mr. Giscard d'Estaing, a center-right political leader who was the president of France from 1974 to 1981, has built up a reputation as a dedicated pro-European leader.
The work of the convention is to start next March.
In 2003, the convention is to present recommendations to the governments of the 15 member states, which in turn would decide a new package of reforms for the European Commission, the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament to ensure that the European Union can work smoothly as a potential bloc of 28. The convention would not only have to suggest changes, but also report on how much support such changes have and from whom.

PERSON: John M. Culbertson 

HEADLINE: John Culbertson, Economist And Trade Protectionist, 80 

BYLINE:  By SIMON ROMERO 

 BODY:
John M. Culbertson, an economist known for mounting an articulate defense of protectionist economic policy long after the tenets of free trade were de rigueur among his colleagues, died on Sunday in Madison, Wis. He was 80.
 Mr. Culbertson had been suffering from Parkinson's disease, according to his wife, Frances. 
 Mr. Culbertson began his career as a specialist in monetary issues for the Federal Reserve System in Washington in the 1950's. He shifted his focus to trade relatively late in his career, in the 1970's, nearly two decades after he became a tenured professor at the University of Wisconsin.
Mr. Culbertson was born in 1922 in Detroit and grew up on a farm in Walled Lake, Mich. His undergraduate education at the University of Michigan was interrupted by World War II, when he served in the U.S. Army Air Corps as an instructor of pilots and a pilot of B-26 Marauders in Europe.
Mr. Culbertson became well known when support for protectionism grew in the 1980's when concern grew about companies' decisions to shift manufacturing and jobs from the United States to cheaper countries abroad and about swelling imports from other nations, especially Japan.
He was a passionate advocate of protectionism, favoring tariffs to limit imports and other barriers designed to shield domestic industries from the threat of foreign competition. Mr. Culbertson's ideas were well received by unions, but he had many detractors in university faculties and research groups.
"The future of the United States depends on whether we can escape from the childish dream world in which 'free trade' is The Good Fairy, and 'protectionism' is The Wicked Witch of the West," Mr. Culbertson wrote in an essay in 1986.
Unable to find publishers for his books and concerned that the University of Wisconsin Press would not enthusiastically promote his work, he formed his own publishing concern, 21st Century Press. He designed the typeface for the press on a personal computer and promoted books with fliers sent to prospective readers.
Using that strategy, Mr. Culbertson published several books in the 1980's, including "Competition, Constructive and Destructive" and "The Dangers of 'Free Trade.' " An earlier book, "Money and Banking," published by McGraw-Hill in 1972, was used as a textbook for undergraduate economics courses for many years.
Mr. Culbertson's critics did not mince words. William A. Niskanen, a former presidential economist, once said that an economics professor who supported protectionism is rarer than "a creationist in a leading biology department." 
By the end of the 1980's, Mr. Culbertson was saying that Reaganomics, with its regulatory changes, tax cuts and increases in military spending, would sputter and fail.
Mr. Culbertson was disillusioned with the spread of free-market policies to countries in the developing world in the 1990's. He attributed much of the instability in these nations to the adoption of theories imported from rich countries.
In addition to his wife, Mr. Culbertson is survived by four children, John, of Vienna, Va.; Joanne, of Arlington, Va.; Lyndall, of New York; and Amy, of Arlington, Va.; and two grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Charity of Relative Newcomers Rivals Gifts to Atlanta From Old-Timers 

BYLINE:  By KEVIN SACK

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Dec. 15 

 BODY:
For most of the last century, the color of corporate and philanthropic influence in Atlanta has been red, Coca-Cola red. But these days, two transplants from the Northeast, Bernard Marcus and Arthur M. Blank, founders of the Home Depot, are painting the town orange.
 Three weeks ago, Mr. Marcus, who grew up in a tenement in Newark, announced he would donate $200 million to build a world-class aquarium in Atlanta. Last week, Mr. Blank, who grew up in the New York borough of Queens, sealed a deal to buy the Atlanta Falcons football franchise for $545 million. 
 Mr. Blank has also become a philanthropic leader in Atlanta, pledging $15 million toward the construction of a symphony hall and announcing this week that his foundation will spend up to $30 million over the next three years to preserve urban green space.
The emergence of Mr. Marcus, 72, and Mr. Blank, 59, reflects something of a transition in a city where the name of Robert W. Woodruff, the Coca-Cola magnate who died in 1985, adorns everything from a downtown park to the city's arts center to the main library at Emory University. Mr. Woodruff's foundation remains a huge player -- it will give away $100 million this year, including $25 million to the arts center -- but it is no longer peerless.
The city's leaders are, of course, thrilled to see Mr. Marcus and Mr. Blank opening their checkbooks. While corporate philanthropy has long been vigorous here, individual philanthropy has been somewhat lethargic, with the notable exception of the Coca-Cola millionaires.
Ted Turner, the wealthy founder of CNN, has lately become more involved with local issues, but his philanthropy in Atlanta has been dwarfed by his devotion to national and international causes. Anne Cox Chambers, the chairwoman of Atlanta Newspapers, which publishes The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, is one of the country's richest women, but officials with local charities say she seems more interested in political fund-raising than in philanthropy. 
That the big money in town is coming from what Mr. Marcus refers to as "Jewish carpetbaggers" says much about the character of modern Atlanta. Not only are Mr. Marcus and Mr. Blank not natives, they are relatively recent arrivals, by Atlanta standards. It was only 23 years ago that they selected the city, purely for business reasons, to open the first of their now 1,313 home improvement warehouses.
"This is a town made up of transplants," said Charles H. McTier, the president of the Robert W. Woodruff Foundation. "But they've come and attached themselves to the community and found an environment that's attractive to them and they want to stay and invest in it." 
Mr. Marcus and Mr. Blank arrived here shortly after being fired as top executives with the California-based Handy Dan Improvement Centers. After surveying four cities, they settled on Atlanta as the place with the right market and real estate conditions to test their theory that consumers would flock to huge stores offering a broad selection of home improvement products, low prices and hospitable service.
Mr. Blank fully retired as chief executive of the Atlanta-based company last May with stock holdings estimated at $1.6 billion. Mr. Marcus will step down as chairman this month with a net worth estimated at $3 billion. Both said they planned to devote themselves to giving back to the community that nurtured their success. 
"Our hope," Mr. Blank said, "is that this will set an example for other individuals who succeeded in their own way."
Mr. Marcus has given scores of millions of dollars to medical research, children's groups and Jewish causes. A new Jewish community center here is named for him, as is an institute devoted to helping children with developmental disorders and brain injuries. He has also given heavily to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The aquarium, which is expected to open by 2005 and will be run by a nonprofit corporation financed by Mr. Marcus, is a bit of a departure. 
"I wanted to do something that was going to be, you could say, spectacular, magnificent, something unique and unusual for the state," said Mr. Marcus, an aquarium buff. 
There has been some grumbling from arts groups that Mr. Marcus's money could have been better spent, but that is apparently a minority opinion. 
"My own feeling," said Shelton g. Stanfill, president of the Woodruff Arts Center, "is that it will only help historical and cultural organizations because it will help make this city a greater destination."
Mr. Blank's foundation has given away $73 million since 1995 and expects to donate $37 million in 2002. An avid runner and sports fan, he said he wanted to use Home Depot marketing techniques to improve the Falcons, a team that has suffered on the field and in attendance.
A recent cartoon in The Journal-Constitution heralded the ownership change by depicting a fan purchasing nails, paint and a toilet seat at a stadium concession stand. Mr. Blank chuckled when he saw it. But at his first meeting with the team, he assured the players that he would resist any temptation to change their uniform colors from red and black to orange.

DATELINE: HOTAN, China 

 BODY:
A crowd gathered in a sports stadium beneath a blue morning sky here in October to watch court officials sentence a man to death, a scene that has been played out hundreds of times across China this year as part of the Communist Party's latest drive against crime.
 But this rally was different. The man, Metrozi Mettohti, 34, was given the death penalty for trying to "split the country" and for storing weapons as part of a persistent and occasionally violent separatist movement among China's Uighurs, the Turkic-speaking ethnic group of nine million people, most of them Muslims, concentrated along the country's far western border. 
 Six other men were given jail terms of up to 12 years that day for separatist activities, said local residents and activists abroad. According to one account, Mr. Mettohti shouted "Long live Eastern Turkestan!" -- the name of the country separatists would like to create -- before being gagged. 
After the rally, local people say, he was put in the back of a truck, driven to a village outside of town and shot in the back of the head. The execution could not be officially verified.
The fragile, fertile strip between China's rugged western mountains and its vast western desert is the only place in the country where people are regularly put to death for political offenses. The country's current anticrime drive, coupled with a renewed focus on Islamic militancy in the wake of the American-led war on terrorism, has only increased the pace of the executions, Uighurs say.
"The government gives very little information about the people who are executed, and news of executions isn't published outside the places where they occur," said a young Uighur man in Hotan, speaking in the privacy of a car in a region where most everyone is jittery when talking to outsiders. 
"Have you heard of 'hazat?' " he said, using the Uighur word for jihad, or Islamic holy war. But he was startled when he saw the word written in a reporter's notebook and insisted that his cellphone number be torn from the same page. 
Then he thought better of discussing politics at all, and with good reason. His brother had been released just days earlier after nearly a decade in jail for publishing separatist tracts. "The secret police are everywhere," the young man said. "You never know who they are."
Most of the Uighurs condemned to death here are charged with murder or with otherwise causing deaths, but some, like Mr. Mettohti, are being executed for lesser transgressions.
The Chinese government says the executions are meant to keep the separatist threat in check, arguing that Beijing is battling Islamic terrorists not unlike those the United States is fighting in Afghanistan, just a few hundred miles away.
But Uighurs say that the number of executions is incommensurate with the threat posed by separatists and that many innocent people have been swept up in the crackdown. Some of those charged with separatism are simply frustrated young men demanding their rights, they say, adding that the war against terrorism war has given Beijing the political cover to pursue policies that are meant to erode their cultural identity.
At least 25 Uighurs have been executed this year and scores more are waiting on death row, say people who track these executions in the local news media. They say the number is probably much higher because the government in August stopped publicizing most of the executions, which Uighurs say are part of a larger effort to suppress legitimate dissent and accelerate the ethnic group's assimilation into the country's larger Han Chinese population. 
This sparsely populated area's oases once watered camels and fortified travelers with raisins, mutton and bread while they paused between mountains and desert on the fabled Silk Road. The Uighurs' local economy is still made up of such stuff.
Though called the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region today, its autonomy is largely symbolic because all major policy decisions are made by the Communist Party and almost all of the region's senior party posts are held by ethnic Chinese. Though Uighurs accounted for more than 90 percent of the region's population when the party came to power in 1949, they account for less than half now.
Hopes for an independent homeland increased after the breakup of the Soviet Union, when a cluster of new, independent Turkic countries appeared on China's western border. But a quick Chinese crackdown dashed those hopes. By the late 1990's, the separatist movement had turned increasingly violent, culminating in a series of bombings and clashes with the police in 1996 and 1997.
The Uighurs are at the eastern end of a swath of Turkic-speaking Central Asia that stretches from the Bosporus to the western edge of the Mongolian steppes and includes 120 million people.
For centuries, the area was ruled by various khans until the Qing dynasty took control here in the mid-18th century. The Qing court consolidated its hold on the region in the mid-19th century with the help of China's legendary General Zuo Zongtang (better known in the West as General Tso, for whom a popular chicken dish is named). He renamed the area Xinjiang, or New Territory.
Today, Xinjiang is China's largest province, accounting for one-sixth of the country's land and much of its valuable natural resources, most notably oil.
Despite centuries of Chinese rule, though, the Uighurs have maintained a vibrant culture, with writers and musicians continuing to produce popular works -- some now banned by the government -- in the Turkic language.
They re-established contact with the Muslim world in the 1980's as the country opened up again. Some Uighurs were allowed to travel to Mecca for the hajj, Islam's annual pilgrimage, and many young Uighurs who made the trip brought back a renewed sense of their religious and cultural identity.
How many Uighur separatists are operating in Xinjiang today is impossible to estimate. China says several hundred Uighurs have received training from the Afghan Taliban, and several Uighurs are among the Taliban fighters who have been captured in Afghanistan in the last few weeks. But the number of serious separatists inside China is still believed to be small.
"This is mostly social and civil unrest by disorganized, disgruntled, fairly impulsive young men, not a widespread movement," said Dru C. Gladney, a professor of Asian studies at the University of Hawaii who follows developments in Xinjiang.
The unrest of the late 1990's resulted in a surge of executions. Amnesty International reported that at least 190 people, an average of nearly two a week, were put to death in Xinjiang from January 1997 to April 1999.
Several of the executions this year have taken place in Yili, known as Yining in Chinese, where a Uighur demonstration protesting China's restrictive policies erupted into a riot in February 1997. At least nine people died in the melee, scores of Uighurs were arrested and many of them were sentenced to death or long prison terms.
As recently as Oct. 15, two Uighurs were executed in Yili for their roles in the riots, according to local press reports. Three other Uighurs were given the death penalty with a two-year suspension and six more were sentenced to jail terms, two for life.
The repression has deepened Uighur resentment of the Chinese, but has also eroded sympathy for the separatists. In Kashgar, an ancient Silk Road market town, talk of the political tensions are nervously dismissed by most people, many of whom say the desire for independence remains, but the hope for it is gone.
"We just want to make money and live in peace," said a young Uighur businessman in Kashgar. "The separatists have brought pressure on everyone."
The anticrime campaign is not likely to stop the periodic violence.
In September, local Uighurs say, a gun battle on the road from Kashgar to the Pakistan border left one policeman and two Uighurs dead. A third Uighur involved in the incident was caught and is expected to be executed soon. 
The government has called for an intensification of the crackdown in Xinjiang.
China's vast state security apparatus monitors tens of thousands of people whose allegiance to the Communist Party is suspect. While the majority of Chinese enjoy a level of freedom today unprecedented in the 52 years since the Communist Party took control, the party is unforgiving and unrelenting in its pursuit of anyone who challenges its rule.
In Uch Turfan, or Wushi, a county seat in a crook of the snowy-peaked Heavenly Mountains, which separate China from Kyrgyzstan, armed guards patrol bridges and children scatter in panic when a strange car stops near them.
The town has been a center of anti-Chinese sentiment since the mid-18th century, when Qing troops were sent here to quell a Uighur uprising.
According to Uighur legend, seven girls retreated to a rocky mount at one end of town and resisted the troops for days until they were killed by cannon fire. Access to their tomb atop the mount is now blocked by a locked gate.
Local residents, most of whom are reluctant to speak to foreigners, say 28 Uighurs were sentenced at a rally outside the town's movie theater on Nov. 11. Among them was a man who had translated the United Nation's Universal Declaration of Human Rights into the Uighur language and distributed it to others. He was reportedly given a 20-year jail term.
Most of the others were also charged with political activities and two were executed immediately after the rally. Dilxat Raxit, a spokesman for the East Turkestan Information Center, based in Sweden, said the men were political activists, but an Uch Turfan court official, reached by telephone, insisted that the men had been executed for murders unrelated to politics.
China acknowledges that its prisons hold nearly 2,000 political prisoners, most serving sentences for endangering state security, according to China's Justice Department.
But those numbers do not include people locked up in the country's reform-through-labor camps, to which the Public Security Bureau has the power to sentence people without trial. In the last three years, there has been a marked increase in the imprisonment of religious activists in such camps, including Uighur Muslims. 
Nor does the Justice Ministry's count include political activists charged with other criminal offenses. Many of the state's political enemies are convicted of disturbing social order, illegal publishing or even consorting with prostitutes.
Thousands of people are held for days, weeks or even months in Public Security Bureau detention centers and Communist Party guest houses while under investigation for political crimes. The country's Religious Affairs Bureau has even put bishops loyal to the pope into retirement homes where they are neither allowed to leave nor receive visitors.
The political activists in Xinjiang stand out because of the potency of their dissent and the power of the government's reaction.
Many towns in southern Xinjiang are populated almost entirely by Uighurs, and Chinese rule of the territory has long been marked by Uighur uprisings. 
In 1933, the short-lived Eastern Turkestan Islamic Republic was declared in Kashgar. A decade later, Uighurs tried to found another republic farther north in Yili and governed a semiautonomous area there under Kuomintang control until the Communists took over in 1949. Uighurs in Hotan staged another failed uprising in 1954 before lapsing into decades of isolation under Mao.
Fearing that Islamic orthodoxy could be used as a cloak or catalyst for political activism, China is quietly trying to stop its spread and suppress its religious practices. Dozens of illegal religious schools and unauthorized mosques have been shut this year, according to people and press reports here. Government employees risk their jobs if they go to mosques, and women working for the government are forbidden to wear veils.
The government denies that it has also stepped up efforts to dissuade Uighurs from observing Ramadan, Islam's holy month of daylight fasting. But Uighurs say that restaurants and food stalls are given tax breaks if they stay open in the daytime and that schoolchildren are prohibited from going home at lunchtime and are encouraged to eat a noon meal at school.
Mainstream Uighurs say the repression and the drumbeat of executions threaten to turn a small ethnic-based movement into a more volatile religious one.
Near the medieval bazaar in this ancient Silk Road town where Mr. Mettohti lived stands a beige-brick mosque, which is closed and uncompleted, leaving local Muslims yet again without their traditional home for the festivals at the end of Ramadan.
Asking why the mosque's main gate remains boarded up, years after construction began, makes residents visibly nervous.
"We wanted to build it taller, but the government would not agree," said a young Uighur man with a thick black mustache.
To isolate orthodox Uighur Muslims, some of whom have been influenced by the extreme Wahhabism of Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, Beijing is mounting a political re-education campaign for 8,000 imams in charge of the region's state-sanctioned mosques.
The campaign started in mid-March and will run until the end of December. The Muslim leaders are required to attend seminars on religious and political policies set by the government and on Xinjiang history as written by the Communist Party.
"These lessons are essential to the long-term stability of Xinjiang," said a recent report by the official New China News Agency, "as they will guide our students away from ideological confusion and mistakes."

HEADLINE: Some Book Buyers Read the Price And Decide Not to Read the Rest 

BYLINE:  By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK 

 BODY:
Taking a break from Christmas shopping last week, Bernadine Fagan stopped by the Borders near her home in Bohemia, on Long Island, to buy some books for herself -- Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of Literature and a paperback by Susan Johnson, the romance novel "Tempting." 
 But then she saw that the hardcover encyclopedia was $45 and the paperback was $15. 
 "Granted the encyclopedia is a big book," Ms. Fagan, 60, said, "but that is a lot of money for a book. And they wanted $15 for the paperback, so I put it down -- I couldn't be bothered." 
Across the country this holiday season, recession-minded book buyers are suffering a wave of sticker shock. Cover prices have crossed thresholds over the last two years, and the big bookstore chains and online retailers have pulled back from previously widespread discounts. More shoppers face prices like $35 for hardcover nonfiction, $26 or more for a hardcover novel, $15 or more for upscale paperbacks. 
Customers show signs of resistance. Publishers say that, along with the rest of the economy, book sales have fallen off this fall. Some in the industry say publishers should reconsider their prices, especially in view of the many cheap alternatives to reading a book.
Publishers say that book prices have risen only about as fast as inflation over the last decade, and that their profit margins have not improved. But books still seem expensive compared with other, proliferating forms of entertainment, said Paco Underhill, a retail consultant and the author of "Why We Buy" (Simon & Schuster, 1999, $25).
"Everyone screams about how the number of books selling is flat or going down," Mr. Underhill said, "and yet the relative price of books keeps going up and the relative price of everything else keeps coming down." Movies, though more expensive at theaters, he said, are also available on videotape and DVD and cable. 
Just last week, Leonard Riggio, chairman of Barnes & Noble, interrupted a meeting with several major publishers to urge them to reconsider prices. He told them that publishers and retailers would both make more money if books cost less. In a speech to publishers last year, Mr. Riggio told them that they chose prices "foolishly" and that some prices were "abominations." 
"I am just exhorting them to do what is good for themselves," Mr. Riggio said in an interview. Publishers paid too much attention to their own costs, he said, and too little to consumer expectations. As a result, prices are not only high but also unappealing. A typical price of $22.50 should be below $20 or it might as well be $25, he said.
Booksellers customarily insist that all their wares are bargains, but some small bookstore operators agree with Mr. Riggio.
"I think they would sell more books and make more money if they lowered the prices," said Paul Ingram, a buyer at Prairie Lights Bookstore in Iowa City, "but whenever I tell that to someone in publishing they go completely gaga about all the costs." 
Still, other store owners trust publishers to pick the right price. Many consumers continue to pay up, albeit not as many as publishers would like.
The retailers' complaints have provoked disagreements among publishers over how to respond. Publishers acknowledge that they pick prices more by instinct than by market research. But many say that consumers would pay even more for the unique experience of reading a book. 
Stephen Rubin, publisher of the Doubleday Broadway group at the Random House division of Bertelsmann, said, "I am just convinced that there is no difference between $22 and $23. Let's face it, price is not a factor if it is a book that you really want." 
But Laurence Kirshbaum, chairman of the books division of AOL Time Warner, said he got Mr. Riggio's message. 
"There is no question that, at the low end, with respect to mass market paperbacks, for example, we have hurt ourselves by going to $7.99," Mr. Kirshbaum said. "That is not an attractive price for the consumer.
"I don't agree that prices are too high across the board, but we will certainly reassess at the end of the year," he added. "When our retailers feel our prices are too high, then we have to take a hard look."
Carolyn Reidy, president of adult publishing at the Simon & Schuster division of Viacom, said she planned to be more conservative about prices, mainly because the biggest bookstore chains were no longer marking down as many books.
"Publishers have come to rely on that discounting at the major accounts to help us market the books, and as they started doing less discounting it became worrisome," Ms. Reidy said. She says customers have been shopping around more for the best price.
Still, she said, such worries have not stopped Simon & Schuster from pushing the limits with some books, like David McCullough's biography "John Adams." Simon & Schuster published it this year for the lofty cover price of $35 -- $5 more than for his last book, "Truman," in 1992. 
"We priced 'Adams' at $35 with a hope and a prayer and a gulp, because that is a high price for a popular book," Ms. Reidy recalled. 
It became a best seller. Now it has set the pace for other publishers this year who have imposed prices $35 and above on a range of hardcover nonfiction, including some non-best sellers, like a collection of essays by the novelist Martin Amis. Farrar, Straus & Giroux priced Roy Jenkins's biography of Winston Churchill at $40, and Doubleday priced Peter Ackroyd's "London: The Biography" at $45.
Publishers and bookstore owners emphasize that movie tickets have gone up, too. 
"Compared to a movie," said Richard Heffernan, president of hardcover sales at the Penguin Putnam division of Pearson, "you get quite a few hours of entertainment for the price, you can give it to somebody when you are done, and 9 times out of 10 the book is better than the movie anyway." 
But Lorraine Shanley, a principal in the book industry consulting company Market Partners, noted that many books went unread. "It doesn't matter that you could get 15 hours of pleasure out of it," Ms. Shanley said.
Some publishers worry that 15 years of price wars among retailers have eroded consumers' sense of what a book is worth, leading jaded shoppers to pay more attention to the level of the markdown than the price. Consumers may balk at paying $25 for one hardcover book when they see another $35 hardcover marked down at some stores by 40 percent, to $21.
As book retailers have narrowed their discounts, general merchandise stores like Wal-Mart and warehouses like Price Club have become the principal remaining discounters. Although they stock only a small selection of the fastest selling titles, they can sell more than 25 percent of the copies of some books.
Mr. Riggio, of Barnes & Noble, helped set the pattern himself 15 years ago by pioneering deep discounts, which in turn encouraged publishers to raise prices and count on retail markdowns.
Mr. Kirshbaum, though cautious about price increases, also said that consumers' hunger for discounts led him to keep prices up.
"The fallacy is that even if we lower our prices they are still going to be discounted by lots of people, and all we are going to be doing is cutting into our profit margins," Mr. Kirshbaum said, "The bargain hunters are going to want a book discounted, whatever the price is."
The cycle of rising book prices and retail discounts is a longstanding complaint of small bookstore owners, who say they cannot afford to keep up. They say discounting best sellers increases their sales at the expense of other books. 
Bill Petrocelli, vice president of Book Passage in Corte Madera, Calif., argued that once publishers raised best-seller prices above psychological barriers like $20, $25 or $30, "it has a drag effect on the rest of the list." 
Some independent stores argue for removing suggested prices from the book jackets and covers so that discounts at the big chains would not be so conspicuous and alluring. But publishers say they want some control over what stores charge customers. Prices to consumers have risen over the last decade even though printing and binding costs have declined significantly, said Stephen Snyder, executive vice president of the Book Manufacturers Institute. Although paper prices are cyclical, improvements in technology have made manufacturing cheaper. Consolidation in both publishing and printing has lowered prices through economies of scale and stiffer competition, he said.
As a result, manufacturing a hardcover book usually costs a publisher little more than $2 a copy, while producing a high-end paperback costs less than $1 a copy. Longer books and special features like color photographs raise costs, however.
Publishers also need to pay for the cost of unsold copies, typically about 30 percent of the number printed. Publishers typically sell books to stores wholesale for about half the cover price.
But publishers' profit margins remain among the lowest in the media industry. They are spending more for advances for big-name authors and to market their books. Publishers compete fiercely in both areas, fighting to woo authors and readers and squeezing their profits in the process. Bookstores have raised publishers' costs, too, by charging more to promote their books.
The resulting prices came as a shock to Lori Traikos, a photographer back from 12 years in London. At a Midtown Manhattan Barnes & Noble last week Ms. Traikos said she was struck by higher prices and fewer markdowns than she had remembered. 
"The prices are kind of astonishing," she said, "I keep putting things back because I look at the price -- $34.95 for a hardcover book." 

CORRECTION-DATE: January 5, 2002

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, a front-page article on Dec. 16 about the rising prices of books omitted necessary words in a comment from Stephen Rubin, publisher of the Doubleday Broadway group at the Random House division of Bertelsmann. The error was repeated in the Economic Scene column on Thursday. Mr. Rubin's quotation, with the omitted passage shown in brackets, was: "I am just convinced that there is no difference between $22 and $23. Let's face it , if you want a book in translation from a Czech writer, you are going to buy the book -- price is not a factor if it is a book that you really want."
A biographical sketch on Dec. 28 about James Straine, a World Trade Center victim who was a Cantor Fitzgerald bond salesman with a passion for fishing, misstated his age. He was 36, not 38.

LOAD-DATE: December 16, 2001 THe was a steady, gentle man, slow to anger, who covered his wife Diane and her children with a mantle of security. He understood the value of time and unwavering persistence: he beat back bladder cancer and smoke inhalation, too.What's the exceptional rush? Only to a fire: Henry Miller drove the truck for Ladder Company 105 in Brooklyn. MARY STANLEYModest Helpmate Mary Stanley was not the kind to go on and on about herself. Even her closest friend, Bunny Johnson, did not know until after her death that Mrs. Stanley was a vice president at Marsh & McLennan. Nor did Mrs. Johnson know what had brought her from the Midwest to New York as a teenager, with just a high school diploma, or why she was out of touch with most of her family.But Mrs. Johnson, who grew up in Bedford Stuyvesant with Mrs. Stanley's husband, Paul, did not care. It was enough for her that "every important occasion, there was Mary." When the Johnsons' landmark home was gutted by fire, for example, Mrs. Stanley was at her friend's side, on nights and weekends for nearly a year, sifting through debris, restoring ruined woodwork and helping to replace what was lost with a steady stream of gifts.Mrs. Stanley, 53, was equally steadfast when her husband, 14 years her senior, had a brain embolism more than two decades ago. Mrs. Johnson said that everyone "gave Paul up for dead, but he survived because of Mary." She became the family breadwinner, while Mr. Stanley was the cook. She also was in charge of technology, as she was at work. Mr. Stanley does not even know how to turn on the answering machine, Mrs. Johnson said. So these days the phone just rings and rings. MICHAEL DeRIENZOHalf of a Duo Michael DeRienzo, a broker at Cantor Fitzgerald, had the safe job in his family. It was his twin sister, Lisa, a narcotics detective in the New York City Police Department, who put herself in harm's way every time she went to work. Mr. DeRienzo was so nervous that he would call daily and beep her if he got no answer at her desk. "I'm OK, I'm OK," Ms. DeRienzo, who just turned 36, would assure him.Mr. DeRienzo and his sister were close as close can be, twins and then some. Their father had disappeared years back, remarried and not maintained contact with the family. Their mother died of cancer four years ago. "It was just him and me," Ms. DeRienzo said. "We were like magnets."As children, attending parochial school near the family's Staten Island home, she was the standout athlete. Michael would grow testy with people who considered him merely "Lisa's brother." All that changed in college, she said, when her brother reached his full growth -- tall and thin, a marathoner-in-the-making, a favorite among the girls at Wagner College. "Then it was 'Lisa who?' " she said.On Sept. 10, the twins were planning a weekend trip to Chicago for a Mets-Cubs game, to be together on the anniversary of their mother's death. Instead, with a fellow member of the narcotics task force who also lost a sibling, Ms. DeRienzo spent the doubly sad day in the bucket brigade at the World Trade Center. DOROTA KOPICZKOSunny Personality Bugoslawa Kopiczko's words about her daughter Dorota come in a torrent of tearful Polish. "We came in September 1992," she said, with a neighbor, Ewa Kowalski, interpreting. "Dorota was 17. She loved it right away. She wanted to know everything."Dorota Kopiczko embraced the American way from the start. After teaching herself English and working her way through Montclair University in New Jersey by cleaning offices and waiting tables, she got an accounting job at a firm in Parsippany, N.J.When the firm was acquired by Marsh & McLennan and she started working on the 100th floor of 1 World Trade Center, Ms. Kopiczko was overjoyed. She bubbled through the office every day -- she was known there as Sunshine, for both her ebullient personality and her blond hair -- and made friends with everybody. At night she prepared for the C.P.A. exam. She had already fulfilled her dream of owning a home -- a town house in Nutley, N.J. -- at age 25. But she wanted more. "She was all the time dreaming to get a higher position at work," her mother said. "One time she took me to Franklin Lakes, one of the most beautiful towns in New Jersey. We looked at the houses, and she said, 'Mommy, don't worry. One day we will have this.' " CHRISTOPHER S. GARDNERThe Captain of the Ship Christopher S. Gardner had a lifelong passion for the sea and was a born skipper. "He was always the captain of the ship," his brother Jonathan said, "whether that was at work, around the house, or on the boat. He had an incredible amount of energy."Mr. Gardner, 36, rose at dawn each day and drove to the World Trade Center, where he was an executive at Aon, with a large staff reporting to him on the company's global risk services. He was a combination of boss and friend -- a captain beloved by his crew, even when he had to lay someone off, which he found agonizing.When he got home, he and his wife, Susan, put their children, Christopher Trowbridge, almost 4, and Alexander, 2 1/2, to bed, which he found delightful. "He never brought work home," Mrs. Gardner said. "He never played golf a single weekend in his life. We really tried to maximize our time with the children."This past summer the family spent a lot of time in Maine, where Mr. Gardner took the boys sailing and began their seafaring education. They were too young to absorb much information, but they loved steering the ship with their dad. "First Christopher drove the boat," Jonathan Gardner. "Then Alexander got so excited, he just had to drive it. And meanwhile the boat is going all over the place, all over this crowded harbor." But the captain was happy and in control."He was never worried," Mr. Gardner said. BARRY SIMOWITZOf Cats and Cashmere Not every cat is presented with its own futon. But then, not every cat owner is as devoted as Barry Simowitz was to Wanda June, the brown-and-white beauty with whom he shared the last five years.The pair could often be found in the living room of Mr. Simowitz's apartment on the Lower East Side -- Wanda June on her futon, Mr. Simowitz in his favorite chair from Pottery Barn -- listening to opera on his high-end stereo system. "Animals were his main passion," said Mr. Simowitz's sister, Laurie. "And he really, really loved Wanda June."Mr. Simowitz, an auditor for the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance, also had a thing for luxurious clothing. "He left about 100 cashmere sweaters in his closet, all different colors," Laurie Simowitz said. "You name an expensive store, my brother shopped there."He loved his job in the World Trade Center, where he showed off his impeccable fashion sense and answered colleagues' questions about their cats. His mother, Mollie, stopped working at 83, and Mr. Simowitz, who was 64, had every intention of following her example.Mollie Simowitz, now 93, misses her only son fiercely.December 23, 2001

Broad Recession Touches Most Sectors of Country
The nation's first economic downturn in 10 years has quickly become one of the broadest on record. Every large industry, except health care and housing, is shrinking, and almost every state is losing jobs. But the economy remains much stronger than it was in the 1980's or early 90's. Many fewer people are out of work now. Still, the blanket of recession has managed to cover the country despite remaining relatively thin. A1

Consumers Balk at Book Prices
Recession-minded book buyers are suffering sticker shock this holiday season, resisting prices like $35 for a hardcover and $15 for a paperback. Publishers defend their steady price increases, but some in the industry say it is time to reconsider. A1

Seizures of Drugs Surging
Heightened security after the Sept. 11 attacks has had a major side effect: seizures of illegal drugs along the nation's borders and at its ports of entry have increased greatly. The biggest increase, 326 percent, was in seizures from commercial traffic along the Canadian border. A32

Missile Program Canceled
The Pentagon has canceled a Navy program intended to shoot down short-range ballistic missiles, a decision that military officials said was the first in a series of likely changes in missile defense programs. A34

In the Rockaways, sand dunes ripple past underground silos that once housed nuclear-tipped missiles. On the island where New York City maintains potter's field, prisoners bury the indigent near the foundations of former Army barracks. At a Staten Island park, children dig soccer cleats into land that offers a faint outline of a former Army air field. Almost anywhere you go in New York City, there are vestiges of a colorful military past. Today, Fort Hamilton in Brooklyn is the only active-duty base remaining. A41

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: LOOKING HOMEWARD; 
Afghans Looking Homeward From Exile With Wary Eyes

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS FRANTZ 

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Dec. 15 

 BODY:
The streets of Islamabad's Afghan quarter bustle with the sights and smells of Kabul. Freshly slaughtered sheep hang on hooks outside butcher shops and sidewalk chefs prepare fried cauliflower and lamb to break the Ramadan fast. Most people pausing over the gold bangles and bolts of cloth are Afghans, and most of them have one eye turned toward home now that the promise of peace has arrived there.
 Ghulam Dastgir sews wedding dresses in his tiny shop in the heart of the quarter, stitching pearls to satin just as he did in Kabul until the Taliban beat his customers for irreverent indulgence and closed him down six years ago. 
 Like some four million of his countrymen over the last 22 years, Mr. Dastgir fled Afghanistan in search of sanctuary. He sought it in Pakistan, making his way here to the capital with his wife and child, trying to rebuild a life. 
Now Mr. Dastgir, a handsome, bearded man of 55, is weighing the prospect of going home. But like most of his countrymen, the collapse of the Taliban is not enough to lure him back. He has, he said with a flash of his scissors, certain conditions.
"If there is work, we would like to go back," he said, "but only when things are settled and there is peace. Even now, things are not that certain."
Pakistan is home to at least two million Afghan refugees, the largest population outside Afghanistan itself. Judging from interviews in Islamabad and the frontier town of Peshawar in recent days, the great majority of them want to go home, but they appear to be in no great hurry.
"The people know better than any of us when would be the best time to return," Maki Shinohara, an official with the United Nations relief agency in Pakistan, said. "For now we don't believe it's safe, and it's not feasible in winter."
Afghans have learned from bitter experience that security is elusive. They have escaped the last 22 years of virtually continuous war in waves -- the first 400,000 pouring into Pakistan in 1980, the year after the Soviet invasion of December 1979. By 1990, after a decade of war evicted the Soviets, the total in this country peaked at 3.27 million, according to United Nations figures.
Even after the defeat of the Soviets, refugees took their time returning home, wary of the constant and indiscriminate violence of feuding warlords. Still, more than a million went home from Pakistan in 1992, the largest repatriation in Afghan history. 
But the number venturing home dwindled to a few thousand a year as the civil war went on and the medieval rule of the Taliban started. In 1995, the number of refugees in Pakistan reached a low of one million, but it soon resumed an inexorable climb as the Taliban spread their orthodoxy in the company of drought.
There were at least two million refugees in Pakistan before the start of the American bombing in October; another 200,000 or so are thought to have arrived since through borders that, while officially closed, are porous to those who either bribe their way across or trek through on remote mountain paths.
In the last two weeks, however, the first brave -- or desperate -- souls began returning to Afghanistan. Their numbers are small -- the United Nations estimated 7,000 people crossed back at the southwestern Pakistani city of Quetta last week and another 1,800 at Torkham in northwestern Pakistan.
Buses crossing to Afghanistan over the weekend were loaded with families headed home for the Eid holiday that marks the end of the holy month of Ramadan. Women wore new, brightly colored burkas and men carried gifts and children.
The visitors acknowledged that these are tentative steps -- holiday visits with relatives to sample life at home before returning to Pakistan. Still, many are determined to go home for good, and soon.
"I'm trying to make enough money to go back to Jalalabad as soon as I can," Hayat Ullah, 19, said as he stood in the butcher shop outside Peshawar where he works. "Everyone I know wants to go home, but they don't know when it will be safe."
Indeed, the primary obstacle to large-scale repatriation now is security. Though the American-led coalition has routed the Taliban and contained Al Qaeda in a mountainous enclave of eastern Afghanistan, the country's many warlords and tribal factions are still scrapping over the spoils. The prospect of anarchy and mayhem replacing the Taliban is not illusory; rival groups have, for instance, been fighting in northern Afghanistan.
Then there is a matter of jobs and food, both in short supply in a country where six million to seven million people are reported to remain on the brink of starvation despite the resumption of music in the streets.
Finally, there is winter; only the bravest or the most desperate are likely to return before spring.
But when the snows melt from the beautiful mountains and temperatures warm in the valleys, Afghans will start to go home in large numbers. United Nations officials expect close to a million Afghans will head back over the next year, provided that they feel there are sufficient security, jobs and food.
Ahmed Farid Nasri, once a soldier in the Afghan army, left Kabul 17 years ago after his home was destroyed in fighting against the Soviets. Now a short-order cook in Islamabad, he said he would pack up his family return in a heartbeat and start from scratch if the situation remains peaceful in the spring. "I'm going home, no problem," he said enthusiastically. "I will be very happy."
Abdul Qahar is a refugee success story. Jailed in the early 1980's for anti-Communist activities, he escaped and ran away to Peshawar in 1985. He finished his degree in accounting and moved to Islamabad, where he has a good job with a United Nations affiliate. He and his wife have three children, all born in Pakistan. "If there is peace tomorrow, I'll go," he said while waiting for a bus. "Why should I stay here?"
Aid workers expect two groups of Afghans to be among the first to return next spring -- those like Mr. Qahar with the means to start over and the newest arrivals who are so poor and miserable that they have no future in Pakistan and, in the eyes of some Pakistanis, no place here.
The government of Pakistan has kept the new refugees in harsh camps near the border, primed to push them home at the first opportunity. One day last week the government said it would begin rounding up refugees in the cities, too, and sending them to the camps. The plan was scuttled the next day after pressure from the United Nations.
Still, Pakistan -- like Iran to the west -- has been burdened economically with its unwanted guests for two decades and United Nations officials are trying to design incentives that will both persuade refugees to go home and help Pakistan recover.
For some, however, home is no longer Afghanistan and they have no plans to return.
Syed Omar and his mother fled Kabul in 1994 after internecine fighting spilled into his brother's wedding party. Seventy-five people were killed, including Mr. Omar's father, four brothers and sister. Only he and his mother escaped, and she refuses to think of returning to the place of such horror.
"My mother is crying and saying she doesn't want to go back no matter what," said Mr. Omar, 27, who works in a music store in Islamabad. "Life is good and we are relatively safe over here."
Mr. Omar said he has been refused refugee status by the United Nations, so he lives illegally in Pakistan. United Nations officials say people like Mr. Omar who choose to stay should be accommodated in some fashion by the Pakistani government.
"You cannot just uproot people," said Ms. Shinohara of the United Nations. "We found that out in the Balkans when long-term refugees refused to go home," she said, alluding to the 1990's wars in the former Yugoslavia, which also displaced millions of people.
There also is the matter of accommodating the people who do return to Afghanistan, many of them skilled. 
Inevitably tensions arise, with those who remained resenting those who fled. But in the first tentative glow of peace there seems to be a sense among at least some refugees that they will be welcomed home with open hearts.
"We are all Afghans," said Mr. Qahar, the accountant, "and that has not changed."

HEADLINE: Equal Opportunity Recession: Almost Everyone Is Feeling It 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT; This article was reported and written by Daniel Altman in New York; Pam Belluck in Boston; David Firestone in Elba, Ala.; Rachelle Garbarine in New Jersey; Laura M. Holson in Stateline, Nev.; Peter T. Kilborn in Alton, Ill.; Ross E. Milloy in Houston; Terry Pristin in New York; and Matt Richtel in San Francisco, with Mr. Leonhardt.

 BODY:
The nation's first economic downturn in 10 years began, like many of its predecessors, with a drop in factory orders along the manufacturing spine that runs from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico. By early this year, the slump had spread to the technology cubicles of Silicon Valley and elsewhere, courtesy of the deflation of the Internet bubble.
 But in the three months since Sept. 11, the recession's narrow early focus has been lost. The downturn has quickly become one of the broadest on record. 
 Every large industry, save health care and housing, is shrinking. Almost every state is losing jobs. Unemployment has risen for nearly every group, climbing most sharply for college graduates and others who usually escape the brunt of a downturn. 
However weakened, today's economy remains much stronger than it was in the 1980's or early 90's. Many fewer people are out of work today than then. Yet most remarkably, the blanket of recession has managed to cover the country despite remaining relatively thin.
"This is a very broad-based, shallow recession," said Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Economy.com, a consulting firm in West Chester, Pa.
In resorts around Lake Tahoe, in California and Nevada, hotels are offering rooms for $39 a night to keep up their business. In Boston and elsewhere, temporary-help agencies continue to pare their payrolls. Business is still weak in technology centers like San Jose, Calif. And old-line industries like steel and textiles, which were shrinking even before the recession began, are faring even worse now.
Almost no part of the country has been spared, Mr. Zandi said, but nearly every part of the country is worse off than it was a year ago. And the magnitude of the decline has been unusually uniform.
This pattern contrasts with the patchwork of past recessions, when layoffs were concentrated in a few regions and among those who worked with their hands on assembly lines and construction sites. The recession of 1990-91 was the first to leave large numbers of white-collar workers jobless, but it still did not spread its pain equitably, pushing the Northeast and California into such a deep hole that they did not catch up with the rest of the country for several years.
Even the vast service sector, which normally serves as the economic stabilizer, is now suffering. It has lost more jobs since September than it did in any other three-month period since World War II.
People who remain secure in their jobs are receiving smaller salary increases than they did in recent years, and many well-off Americans -- whose prodigal spending helped fuel the boom -- will be receiving much smaller bonus checks in coming weeks than they did in recent years.
The end of rapid income growth could make consumers thrifty for months, some economists worry, and could mean that the recovery gets off to a slow start. Still, with interest rates and energy prices low, forecasters expect the recession to end early next year, even if they disagree about how strong the recovery will be.
The breadth of the current downturn is not solely the result of the shock caused by the terrorist attacks. In recent years, as many cities and towns have lured companies from elsewhere with tax breaks and cash grants, regional economies have diversified and begun to look more alike.
Between March, when the recession officially began, and November, 37 states lost more jobs than they gained. Many of those states, now grappling with revenue shortfalls, are considering budget cuts that themselves are likely to aggravate the downturn. Although the 1990-91 recession was more severe than this downturn, employment fell in only 31 states through its first eight months. 
For many younger people, who have known nothing but prosperity since they entered the work force, the new situation has come as a shock. Many without work are unsure how soon they will be able to find a job that pays as much as their old one did.
"Growing up, you never heard of this: this didn't happen to my friends' parents," said Allegra Kochman, a 31-year-old graduate of Dartmouth and Columbia who was laid off this month, along with 40 other people, from her job at an architecture firm in New York.
"I was stunned," said Ms. Kochman, who was locked in a stairwell the night she was laid off, when her company turned off her electronic key before she was finished cleaning out her desk. "This isn't supposed to be happening."

Travel
The Industry Hurt the Most
Snow for the nearby ski slopes was on its way outside a huge casino in southern Lake Tahoe in Nevada, but inside, the chairman of Harrah's Entertainment Inc. was anxiously watching the chips fall instead.
"Those are $100 chips," said Philip G. Satre, Harrah's chief executive, peering across the floor of the casino at an elderly man seated at a nearly empty poker table. The problem, from Mr. Satre's standpoint, was that there were not enough of them.
When Mr. Satre's eyes lit upon six young players clustered around a nearby game, however, they brightened. "I like that table," he said. "It's fully occupied."
While almost every sector of the economy ground to a halt at least briefly after the Sept. 11 attacks, companies dependent on travel-and-leisure spending were hit the hardest. Already in retreat as companies cut back on business travel, airlines and hotels lost even more business when many Americans simply stopped flying.
Now, three months later, more people are traveling again, but that has done nothing to reverse the loss of more than 202,000 jobs -- about 6 percent of the total -- in the airline and lodging businesses since March.
Particularly hard hit have been gambling meccas like Las Vegas and vacation destinations like Orlando. In a typical year, the Lake Tahoe region in California and Nevada has two million visitors, who provide the spending that supports jobs for about 80 percent of the working population in this town of 40,000 people. But not this year.
Mr. Satre said he first saw the downturn at Harrah's casino after the Internet boom imploded in Silicon Valley. The company has a sophisticated system to monitor customers; last spring business dropped 30 percent among the casino's most infrequent guests -- casual younger visitors who ski or hike for a weekend and gamble a little as well.
To combat the downturn, Mr. Satre said that Harrah's, in Stateline, Nev., decided to pursue customers it knew could spend as much as $1,500 a year gambling. It usually only goes after much bigger spenders. "What we did is reach down into our database and make offers to customers we otherwise wouldn't," he said.
In October, Harrah's and its sister casino, Harvey's, mailed cards to those customers, offering rooms for as little as $39 a night. They also hit hard on the theme "We're close to home" in advertisements in newspapers in the San Francisco Bay area to capture affluent travelers who, in rosier times, might take off to Vail or Aspen instead.
That strategy has helped hold the tide. For October, Harrah's occupancy rate rose to 91 percent from 82.5 percent last October. Visitors held steady in November, traditionally one of the casino's slowest months.
Gambling revenue for the entire market of southern Lake Tahoe rose 3.25 percent for October, the most recent month tallied, from October a year ago. That is a turnaround from earlier in the year, when monthly revenue fell as much as 10 percent.
But while Harrah's casino has so far avoided long-term layoffs, Mr. Satre is worried about what will happen to the area as it heads into ski season.
Instead of the giddy glee that accompanies a snowfall before a weekend here, resort executives fear the fallout from the terrorist attacks will keep skiers away this winter.
At the Heavenly ski resort, about 60 percent of the skiers arrive by air and most from within the United States, executives at the resort said. Michael Allen, director of Heavenly's ski school, said he was hiring only 275 ski coaches this season, 27 percent fewer than last. He said he expected about 90,000 students, well below the 115,000 the school gets in a good year.
Looking across the Sierra Nevada, where miners sought their fortunes 150 years ago, Mr. Allen, too, was hopeful of better times.
"Our customers," he said, "are worth more than gold."

Temporary Workers
Economic Slump Ends 20-Year Rise
Last year was Bill Bastian's most successful. Business had more than quadrupled from more than a decade ago, when he became president of Command Temporary Services, a temporary staffing agency in Boston that places waiters and kitchen staff.
At this time last year, he was assigning more than 200 workers a day, and had contracted for 40 office holiday parties a week, mostly with companies along the Route 128 technology belt west of the city. 
"A computer company with a new product would bring in 200 people at the Hilton, and they would stay there for three days," Mr. Bastian said. "We couldn't keep up with it. We could not get enough people to handle the business we had."
Not anymore. This year, Mr. Bastian is lucky to send out 125 people a day, and there are virtually no office parties. "All of that is gone because of the recession," he said. 
The recession has ended a nearly continuous 20-year rise in the number of Americans working for temporary-help agencies. In the early 1980's, about 1 of every 200 Americans got their paychecks from temporary work. By the late 1990's, about 1 of every 40 people did, as employers found they could cut costs by paying temporary workers relatively few benefits and being able to hire and fire them with ease. 
But the rapid downturn in the economy, particularly among manufacturers, which are heavy users of temporary workers, has brought an end to that expansion. Since employment at the temporary agencies peaked at 3.5 million in September 2000, it has fallen by 17 percent, to 2.9 million.
Earl Tate, founder and president of Staffing Solutions in Boston, which provides clerical and other workers, said that his business had been down 35 percent this year compared with last, and that since Sept. 11 he had laid off three of his seven staff recruiters. 
"When companies are laying people off they tend not to hire temporaries," Mr. Tate said, "because it does not seem to work as good public relations within their office."
Those that are still hiring temporaries are now looking for workers with more flexibility, Mr. Tate added. "Companies are realizing they can demand workers with higher skills," he said. "Rather than get a receptionist, they may ask for a secretary-receptionist. They are upgrading to a person that can do two or three jobs."
Mr. Bastian said the downturn had not caught him completely by surprise.
"I read the tea leaves," he said. "You could see the recession coming down the pipeline. You tighten up all of your costs and eliminate all the frills. And make sure your receivables are all up to date." 
Mr. Bastian began to call in for overdue payments at computer start-ups that looked as if they might go belly up. He expected the economy to slow him down by about 20 percent. But he was not prepared for the terrorist attacks and the chilling effect they would have on the hotels and convention sites he helps cater.
"It really rocked the food service," said Mr. Bastian, whose business is down about 35 percent. He said no one was in the mood for an office holiday party or a college alumni party. 
As a result, Mr. Bastian said, he has purged a lot of the not-so-good workers and has been placing the best ones in jobs that they might not have taken before. 
"People will do stuff today that they would not do even a year ago," he said. "I have cooks today that will do dishes without blinking an eye."

Health Care
In an Ailing City, A Sign of Strength
The last few months have not been kind to Jason Goode's hometown, Houston. Enron, the local energy giant, has filed for bankruptcy. Continental Airlines, which dominates the city's main airport, has canceled dozens of flights since Sept. 11. And the executives of Compaq Computer believe their best chance for survival involves being acquired by another company and potentially laying off thousands of Houston workers.
But Mr. Goode sounds as if he is still living in the oil-boom days of the 1970's and early 80's. "We're crying for people in almost every category," he said.
He is a recruiter for Memorial Hermann Hospital, and he is working in the single strongest sector in the United States economy today. Even in a recession, people continue to need medical care.
Mr. Goode's employer has more than 500 vacancies for a regular full-time staff of 8,000 people. "Hospitals all across the state are expanding," he said, "and we're all fighting desperately to fill positions that are empty."
His predicament is shared by health care providers nationwide. While overall employment has fallen by about 1.2 million jobs since peaking in March at 132.7 million, the health care industry has added 200,000 jobs over the same span. It now employs 10.5 million workers, according to the Labor Department.
In Houston, the contrast between health care and other, hard-hit industries is readily apparent at a jobs fair attended by about 4,000 laid-off Enron workers. Mr. Goode was just one of several health care recruiters who had come to the fair to find workers.
Among the others was Pam Sumner, whose company hires nursing and other personnel for hospitals and nursing homes.
"I have over 2,000 hours each week of unfilled vacancies," she said. "In 15 years in the nursing industry, I've never seen the shortages of trained personnel as bad as it is right now."
Ms. Sumner said she expected her business, NI Healthcare Inc., to grow three times larger in revenues and employees in the next year, and to grow fivefold in two years. "The demand is just incredible," she said.
In a city where an estimated 7 percent of the work force is employed in some aspect of the health care industry, the single largest health care employer is the Texas Medical Center, a complex of 13 hospitals and 41 member institutions with a direct work force of 61,000. A recent report published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas estimates that the center has a $5.8 billion economic impact on the Houston area, and indirectly helps to employ more than 147,000 people.
Dr. Richard E. Wainerdi, president of the center -- which had 5.4 million patient visits last year -- said his facility was also in an expansion mode. "We'll grow from 22 million square feet to 32 million square feet in the next eight years," he said. "We had planned to accommodate that growth over 15 years."
Dr. Wainerdi points to two main reasons for growth in the health care industry: an aging population, and medical research that is lengthening life spans.
"The research is providing means to keep people who might have died alive longer, but it also means that they need continuing care, sometimes for several different problems at once," he said. "Those people require more care, more medicines, more facilities and more clinical services."
Also, he said, although new research requires new facilities, much of the hospital infrastructure in the country itself is aged and must be replaced. 
That need is feeding regional economic expansion, he said, pointing to one other finding of the Federal Reserve report: Already the largest medical complex in the world, the Texas Medical Center is dwarfing the economic impact of another large and famous Houston-area employer, the Johnson Space Center.

State Budgets
Shortfalls Imperil Local Classrooms
In the southeast corner of Alabama, the small town of Elba felt a tremor last week from the crash in tax revenue that has immobilized state government for the better part of the year.
The town of 4,185 people had already suffered through its own problems: two floods in the last decade and the closings in recent years of a plant making trailers and a textile manufacturer, which cost nearly 1,500 jobs in Coffee County. School enrollment, reflecting the declining population, dropped to less than 1,000 from 1,300 three years ago. 
But a few days ago, Ed Richardson, the state school superintendent, brought Alabama's larger economic problems to Elba's doorstep. The state's tax revenue had dropped so low, Mr. Richardson said, that the state would have to consider disbanding five shrinking school districts, including Elba's, and merging them with that of the surrounding county. He also warned that sports and music programs in schools around the state might have to be dropped.
Such threats have been used before to goad the Legislature into action, and lawmakers meeting in special session quickly began working on a package that would raise corporate taxes for school aid. But in places like Elba, as in many small towns with fragile economic foundations, the prospect of losing autonomy for the schools was a frightening reminder of the effects of a downturn.
"I don't think the state is really going to cut football," said Danny Weeks, superintendent of the Elba schools, "but talk of school closings and consolidation is something none of us like to hear about. We've already got our teachers painting the school and cutting the grass, and we're using some of our textbook money to pay them. It means a lot to our city to have local control of the schools, and I hope we'll be able to keep that."
Alabama is one of 43 states where tax revenue is coming in below expectations because of the recession, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, and one of 36 states that have started cutting the budget as a result. Like many Southern states, it has been particularly hard hit because so much of its budget is based on the volatile sales tax. Last year the state school budget was cut by $260 million because of falling revenue, and the school deficit this year is estimated at $160 million, unless the Legislature acts on a new tax package by this weekend.
Legislators in dozens of states, as well as Alabama, have been called into emergency sessions to cut spending or find new revenue to balance budgets, even after months of warning that boom-time balance sheets were over. There have been across-the-board cuts in Arkansas, Delaware, South Carolina, Virginia and other states, and some have exempted only education from reductions.
That is not possible in Alabama, where the school budget is directly tied to tax revenue, but some sectors of the economy are clearly not willing to accept a new reality. After Gov. Donald Siegelman proposed raising corporate taxes by $160 million to keep the schools afloat, business leaders began running a scornful television commercial.
The governor, says one character in the advertisement, "must be crazier than a sprayed roach."

Technology
Once Unstoppable, A Sector Retrenches
Even in an era of ambitious high-tech dreams, it was a grand vision.
Candescent Technologies, a 90's-era start-up in the business of making ultrathin computer screens that was backed by some of the biggest names in venture capital, started planning several years ago to build a huge manufacturing plant in San Jose, Calif. The plant would finally give the United States a powerful presence in an industry long dominated by Taiwanese manufacturers.
That expensive dream now lies in disarray.
"We basically have a building," said David L. White, the chief executive of Candescent, who explained that the company finally threw in the towel on the project in the last couple of months. "We never even committed to the equipment."
For a long time, Candescent, like many better-known Silicon Valley companies, resisted the notion that the bursting of the dot-com bubble last year would affect its plans. Mr. White said he only gradually accepted the idea that the market would not recover soon, requiring his company to rest its hopes instead on licensing its technology to others.
Candescent is not alone in reining in its ambitions. For example, Intel, the world's leading maker of computer chips, conceded recently that its expansion in the 1990's would have to be sharply scaled back.
"In the first half of 2000, we were under capacity for manufacturing," said Chuck Malloy, an Intel spokesman in Santa Clara, Calif. "The demand was clearly there then."
But this is now. Intel has been forced this year to abandon about 20 office and manufacturing projects already under construction, including buildings in Austin, Tex., Chandler, Ariz., and Folsom, Calif.
Craig Barrett, Intel's chief executive, says he hopes the worst is over -- but even he is not sure what to expect.
"I take solace in the fact that normally these things last 18 months or so, and we're 12 months into it," he said. "So hopefully we're more than halfway through it."
But demand for high-tech products is not expected to improve very much in the year ahead. The most recent monthly survey by CIO magazine and Yardeni.com, the Internet site of Ed Yardeni, the chief investment strategist of Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown, found that chief information officers, the company executives who oversee spending on technology, remained pessimistic.
They think investment in technology equipment, while looking somewhat better than at the low point in September, will grow barely more than 5 percent in the next 12 months, slightly less than it did in the previous year. Only a year ago, they were projecting an annual technology spending increase of nearly 19 percent.
It is all a vivid illustration of how Silicon Valley's technology firms succumbed to their own mantra that the new economy was unstoppable.
In many cases, the companies and their investors felt they had little choice but to chase the dream. If they failed to grow, they worried, shareholders would accuse them of failing to catch one of the great waves of American capitalism.
As for Candescent, it has cut its work force to about 250 people, from a peak of 400. The company once raised $600 million from a variety of investors, who figured that Candescent's technology would satisfy demand from consumers and businesses for the next generation of lower-cost, higher-quality digital screens. 
Instead, Candescent's would-be manufacturing plant in San Jose has become a monument to the era's exuberant investment. Faced with a huge glut in the thin screen display market, it was never able to raise the $500 million more needed to complete the facility.
Now, rather than relying on venture capitalists, Mr. White said he hoped to sustain the company by licensing its technology and relying on investment from corporate partners. "We'll have to be more self-sufficient in terms of financing," he said.
And what happened to his company, Mr. White said, happened throughout the industry.
"People were throwing caution to the wind," he said. "Investors lost their entire perspective."

Housing
Market Rebounds From Sept. 11
While the recession has meant that fewer people are buying houses in many parts of the country, prices have not fallen significantly. Even in the luxury market -- which had been expected to suffer because of the decline in the stock market over the last two years -- sales have rebounded since their lows in the weeks immediately after Sept. 11.
"To my surprise, it's been holding up quite well," said Jeff Hyland, president of Hilton & Hyland, a luxury real estate agency in Beverly Hills, Calif.
The housing market may not be as robust as it was in the final years of the economic boom, but its continued strength remains one of the only bright spots in the economy. Behind that bright spot are low mortgage rates, as well as the long rise in incomes, stocks and home prices in the boom.
Now that a recession has arrived, many buyers and sellers alike have decided waiting is an attractive strategy. Buyers are betting on a longer economic slump in which sellers will eventually have to accept lower prices, Mr. Hyland said. Sellers are patiently watching the market, aware that a house seems as good a place as any for keeping large sums of money right now.
Homeowners, said Bob Becker, the president and chief executive of NRT, the nation's largest residential real estate brokerage, "are not being talked into panic sales."
The median price of previously owned houses fell to $145,000 in October from $152,000 in June, according to the National Association of Realtors. But the decline has simply returned prices to where they had been this spring -- still 9 percent higher than at the start of 2000.
The market already seems to be rebounding from the weakness just after Sept. 11, brokers say. One of the largest residential developers in the Middle Atlantic region, Toll Brothers, says that sales of its houses had already begun to slow before Sept. 11. After the attacks, they plunged 33 percent and stayed that way for a month.
But business began to improve after Toll offered buyers incentives, like an extra room on a house, and below-market mortgage rates.
"Our optimism for 2002 has been rekindled," said Frederick N. Cooper, the company's vice president for finance.
Part of the reason the decline at the high end of the market has not been worse, said Mr. Hyland, the Beverly Hills real estate agent, is that only one section of wealthy Americans has slowed its purchases. Families seeking houses worth less than $1 million -- the low end of the luxury market -- have continued to buy because of low interest rates. The biggest spenders, those seeking houses worth $5 million or more, have not slowed either. 
But for those between, the calculus may be more complicated. The sharp fall in stock prices since early 2000 has left many of these midlevel buyers with a big hole in their portfolios, Mr. Hyland said. Low mortgage rates may not be enough to persuade them to buy into the $1 million-to-$5 million housing market, since these houses usually require down payments of hundreds of thousands of dollars.
House construction has diminished in some high-priced areas, too. In metropolitan San Jose, Calif., the heart of Silicon Valley, 20 percent fewer permits were issued in the first 10 months of this year, compared with the same period last year, said Steve Berman, a statistician at the Census Bureau. The Bay Area as a whole suffered a loss of 13 percent. In New York and its suburbs, permits have slipped 7.5 percent.
That could be a temporary blip or the start of a long decline, brokers said. They expect the uncertainty to continue for at least a few months. "The market today," Mr. Becker said, "is significantly different than it was 30 days ago -- and 30 days prior to that."

Steel
Obsolete Workers Try To Build Future
The recession may be broad-based. But for the steel industry at least, it is not shallow. For steel towns like Alton, Ill., and for workers like Jonathan Walker, the recession began early, and is deep and entrenched.
Six-foot-one and 280 pounds, with hands as meaty and firm as a fielder's mitt, Mr. Walker is one of the sagging economy's hard-core unemployed, a man with knowledge and skills for which the economy no longer has much use.
In the cruel phraseology of industrial demise, the Laclede Steel Company, 400 grim, rusting acres of mills in Alton where Mr. Walker worked for 23 years, is being liquidated. Upon the company's bankruptcy in July, Mr. Walker and 500 other Laclede steel workers were dismissed. 
Foreign steel and a weak global economy have ravaged the American steel industry. According to Mr. Walker's union, United Steelworkers of America, 27 steel companies, union and nonunion and with more than 63,000 workers, have filed for bankruptcy in the last four years. Most are still operating and trying to pay their creditors.
"The real crunch started in the early 80's," said Terry Wooten, the president of Laclede's Steelworkers Local 3643 on Broadway, Alton's industrial thoroughfare, where the huge gravestones of dead factories stand like rusty pyramids. "We tried everything we possibly could to keep this company solvent and viable." 
Now, the industry is looking to Washington for help. Steel makers want trade protection from low-priced imports, but they also want billions of dollars to help pay health and pension benefits. And because they see consolidation as critical to making the industry more efficient and competitive, they want assurances that any mergers will not run into antitrust problems. 
That help, if it comes, will not be of much use to the Laclede workers let go in July. Of those workers, Mr. Wooten said, some have taken low-wage jobs to supplement their wives' mostly low-wage jobs. They also collect about $300 a week in unemployment benefits.
But the unemployment checks end after six months, and that could imperil more than 100 workers who are living on them while going to school to learn new skills. Among them is Rodney Crader, 45, who was a stripper in Laclede's wire mill. Today, he wears the royal blue uniform of Vatterott College, a trade school where he is learning welding. But the course runs until April, and his unemployment checks stop in January. He has some savings, however, and his wife has a full-time job at Western Union. 
The Walkers, whose children are grown, have money concerns as well. Mr. Walker, who earned more than $40,000 a year at Laclede, has no way right now to keep up the $650 in monthly mortgage payments for his house, and menacing collection notices pile up on the desk. Mr. Walker's health insurance has stopped.
In addition to his $300 weekly unemployment check, he earns about $150 delivering pizzas 20 hours a week. His wife, Angelica, earns $150 to $210 a week working up to 33 hours as a supermarket cashier.
Together, they are living on about $16,000 less a year than the $55,000 they had before Laclede closed. When the unemployment checks stop, it will be $31,000 less. 
With little white lights strung on the walls, a two-foot artificial tree in one corner and a big, lush tree in another, the Walkers' home is an exuberant celebration of Christmas. But the big tree was a gift from a friend. For Christmas presents for friends and relatives, Mrs. Walker has filled 20 white cotton socks with beans. With buttons and beads for faces and belly buttons, she has sewn them into jolly snowmen.
Mr. Walker says he does not know what he will be able to give; out of a job, he says his life is out of his control. "I'm in a washing machine," he said, "going up and down, up and down."

Outdoor Adviser Gets Warm Clothes After His Savings Are Used Up

BYLINE:  By AARON DONOVAN 

 BODY:
Famous for advising presidents from Wilson to Truman during conversations on a bench across the street from the White House, Bernard M. Baruch, a City College graduate and early 1900's Wall Street millionaire, became known as the Park Bench Statesman.
 Ed Felder, 77, is considerably less famous than Baruch, who died in 1965 at the age of 94. But Mr. Felder is well known among the students and administrators at Baruch College as an informal adviser with a bench of his own. 
 Rather than talking with presidents about international economic policy, Mr. Felder, a World War II veteran and former public relations specialist, speaks with film students about his experience in the field, and with administrators about fund-raising and public relations.
Baruch's favorite bench was in Lafayette Park in Washington, but Mr. Felder's, a backless wooden model, is not in a park. 
It is on Lexington Avenue, in front of the busy revolving doors of a Baruch campus building. One gets the feeling that if Gramercy Park, a block and a half to the south, were open to the public, Mr. Felder would continue sitting right there on that bench, in the midst of students going to class and busy pedestrians.
"I get all the important ones here," he said from his perch on a mild December morning, "the deans, the heads of all the different departments."
Mr. Felder was himself once a student at the college, then called City College's School of Business and Civic Administration. It was renamed for Baruch in 1953. But in 1943, after Mr. Felder had completed a year of study, he was drafted to serve in the Army.
After the war, he began working in public relations, fund-raising and television production. Over the course of a 50-year career, he said, he worked for 15 different companies and nonprofit agencies, including the Muscular Dystrophy Association of America, the New York Philharmonic and the United Jewish Appeal (which later merged with another agency to become UJA-Federation of New York). The jobs he had were lucrative, and by the time he retired, he had saved $100,000.
Throughout the years that he held these jobs, Mr. Felder never lost his love for walking through the streets of New York. At his peak, he walked five or six miles a day, he said: "The East Side is one thing; Eighth and Ninth Avenue is another world."
But by the late 1990's, his spine had weakened, deteriorating because of a condition known as spinal stenosis. Doctors gave Mr. Felder a brace to wrap around his midriff, but it did little to solve his problems, he said. "I had gotten to the point where I couldn't walk without excruciating pain," Mr. Felder said.
So he checked into Beth Israel Medical Center. He had four operations to have his spine corrected, he said. Medicare paid for 65 percent of the cost but the rest came out of his pocket. After five years he was penniless. "I had to go bankrupt last year," he said. "My life savings, everything was wiped out."
Mr. Felder, who at the time was receiving roughly $600 a month in Social Security and a $288 veterans' pension, could barely afford the $600 monthly rent for his single room across the street from the college. "Because I was living on such a slim margin," he said, "I actually didn't have warm clothing for last winter."
Fortunately, a relative told him that he could receive help from the Jewish Association for Services for the Aged, a beneficiary agency of UJA-Federation of New York, one of the seven local charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
The agency assigned a worker, Sheila Siegel, to assist Mr. Felder. When she found out that he needed clothing, she used money from the Neediest Cases Fund so he could get some. He got a new black leather jacket and some good walking shoes with $240 from the fund.
"We want people to have dignity in the last years of their lives," Ms. Siegel said.
Now, she reports, Mr. Felder looks splendid sitting on the bench in his new shoes and jacket. "This gave me the confidence to sit at the bench and give people advice," he said. "It made an enormous difference psychologically."
One of the people who sits down with him regularly is Jane R. Crotty, the director of community and external affairs at the college. Six years ago, the two got to talking about Baruch's reputation as a park bench adviser and talked about ways to improve awareness of the man and his life. At the time, the school was planning a new building a block away. Mr. Felder suggested that the school put a bench in the lobby with a life-size replica of Baruch there.
Earlier this year, the college did exactly that. At the bench's dedication ceremony, Mr. Felder was honored for his idea, and he was the first person to have his photograph taken on the bench, sitting next to the bronze Baruch. "I'm the broke Baruch," he joked recently, back at his bench on Lexington Avenue, between 22nd and 23rd Streets.
"Do you think they will have a bench of me someday?"

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: PERSONAL SECURITY; 
Steep Rise in Gun Sales Reflects Post-Attack Fears

BYLINE:  By AL BAKER 

 BODY:
Gun and ammunition sales across the country have risen sharply since Sept. 11 as more Americans take what many consider to be the most personal step toward feeling safer: arming themselves.
 According to statistics from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, surveys by firearms associations and anecdotal evidence from storefront gun shops and distributors from Arizona to Florida to Lower Manhattan, the jump in weapons sales followed quickly on the first jarring images of the terrorist attacks. 
 The rise was anywhere from 9 percent to nearly 22 percent during September, October and November, according to F.B.I. statistics on background checks for purchases. The total peaked in October, at 1,029,691, up from 845,886 in October 2000. 
Those in the gun industry say a range of firearms have been purchased, from high-priced handguns small enough to fit inside a purse to shotguns and assault rifles that can be leaned against a wall inside a clothes closet. And, they say, there has been a steady stream of serious-minded first-time buyers. 
"Sept. 11, like other catastrophes, makes people panic, makes them fearful, makes them want to protect themselves and their families against the enemy, who, in this case, is hard to identify," said James Alan Fox, Lipman professor of criminal justice at Northeastern University in Boston. "People may say: 'Let Tom Ridge watch out for our shores. I'll watch out for my doors.' "
To many in and out of law enforcement, such a proliferation of deadly weapons is unsettling, even as scores of new gun owners argue that their right to bear arms is worth exercising to gain a feeling of personal security in troubled times.
"We are always concerned with the overall numbers of guns that are available and out on the street making things unmanageable for law enforcement," said William B. Berger, the police chief of North Miami Beach, Fla., who is president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the nation's oldest and largest group of law enforcement executives, with 19,000 members worldwide.
Some gun manufacturers -- like those in other industries -- are aggressively seeking new clients because of Sept. 11. Ithaca Gun Company is selling its Homeland Security model for "our current time of national need." The Beretta gun company has its "United We Stand," a 9-millimeter pistol bearing a laser-etched American flag. The company sold 2,000 of them to wholesalers in one day in October, said Jeff Reh, vice general manager of Beretta U.S.A.
Gun control advocates have voiced strong concern about the increased sales, citing statistics showing that guns, though purchased by the law-abiding, sometimes end up later in criminals' hands. Some law enforcement officials echo that thought. The advocates also say that more guns in circulation, particularly in the hands of the untrained, increase the chances of violence in the home, suicide, or accidental shooting.
Nevertheless, guns are being bought with the feeling that they will make the buyer safer. Scott Abraham, a Long Island investment broker in his 30's, said he never dreamed of buying a gun until Sept. 11. Last month he bought a Mossberg shotgun because "I don't want to be caught shorthanded," and made a spot to hide it in his house. Thomas M. Iasso, 53, a former police officer who stopped carrying a gun two years ago, bought a .40-caliber Glock after the terrorist attacks -- and he carries it.
"You can't sit there and tell me you can protect me anymore, because you can't," Mr. Iasso said, explaining his purchase.
Both Mr. Abraham and Mr. Iasso bought their guns at John Jovino Gun Shop, the city's oldest, in Little Italy. The shop owner, Anthony F. Imperato, said there had been a steady increase in potential customers expressing interest in obtaining a New York City pistol or shotgun permit. Other people, with permits, want additional weapons, and some people just want to buy self-defense equipment, like pepper spray. 
At Mr. Imperato's gun factory, Henry Repeating Arms Company in Brooklyn, there has been a run on the Henry U.S. Survival Rifle since Sept. 11. It was first manufactured four years ago, but its "name and style and features make it particularly desirable" now, Mr. Imperato said. The components of the gun, a version of the United States Air Force AR-7, can be disassembled and placed in its stock, which is waterproof and floats.
Gun shops and distributors across the country tell similar stories. Local reports in several states, including Texas, Nevada and Virginia, said officials have cited increases in gun sales, and in applications for concealed-weapons permits in the days immediately after the attacks. Members of the Air Line Pilots Association may soon be allowed to carry firearms in their cockpits.
According to Andrew M. Molchan, the director of the 4,000-member Professional Gun Retailers Association in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., firearms retailers have seen significant jumps in sales, especially among first-time buyers and the wealthy.
"Maybe they had more to protect or maybe they had more to lose, or, psychologically, they thought they had more to lose," Mr. Molchan said.
In a survey done about 10 days after the September attacks, the National Shooting Sports Foundation found that 15 percent of gun retailers who were questioned had reported sales increases of more than 25 percent, said Douglas Painter, executive director of the 1,800-member, Connecticut-based organization. The majority of those retailers were in places close to the attacks, like New York City and Washington, as well as in Florida, where some of the terrorists are believed to have lived for a time, he said.
Now the big question is how long the increase in sales will continue. Opinion is split. Many retailers say the buying habits may be affected by global events. "Only time will tell if this current increase in sales will be long-term," Mr. Painter said. 
Some gun retailers say that sales have already begun to level off or decrease in recent days, and that they do not think overall gun sales for the year will break records.
The F.B.I. statistics show increases in the number of background checks for firearms sales and other transactions from September through November. But they had increased very slightly in August as well.
Daniel A. Wells, the assistant operations manager for the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, the F.B.I. section that keeps data on the sales of long guns and handguns, pawn shop redemptions and permit requests, said the number of checks increased 12 percent on Sept. 12 over the same day in 2000.
The number of background checks for gun purchases and other transactions increased to 864,038 for September, an increase of 10.5 percent over the same month last year. In October, they were 1,029,691, a gain of nearly 22 percent over October 2000. And last month, they were 983,186, an increase of more than 9 percent over November 2000, the F.B.I. figures showed. That followed declines in each of those months -- traditional hunting season months -- between 1999 and 2000. So far this month, however, the numbers are on track to be slightly lower than they were last December, though the holiday buying season is not over. 
The checks are considered the most accurate gauge of the number of gun purchases. The totals are not precisely equivalent, because more than one gun may be bought after a single check, or the check may prevent any purchase at all. 
The recent increases were expected, just as gun sales jumped in limited geographical regions after incidents like the Los Angeles riots or before the passage of the Brady Act of 1994, which established a nationwide system of background checks for handgun purchases.
"This time you can project it nationally," Wayne R. LaPierre, chief executive of the National Rifle Association, said of the increased sales.
No one can say for sure if the increase can be attributed solely to the Sept. 11 attacks, but many law enforcement officials and gun industry insiders agree it is a primary reason. Because the F.B.I. has been keeping statistics only since November 1998, it cannot determine whether the increases are part of some cyclical pattern. Some buyers said part of the reason was their feeling that crime was beginning to inch up and that a worsening economy might bring increases in crime. 
"If they were sitting on the fence between 'should I buy a gun or not buy one,' well, this was the catalyst that pushed them over," said a former employee of a major gun manufacturer who lost his job early this year as a result of slumping sales.
The gun industry has been in a general decline over the last three decades as the popularity of sport hunting has waned and fewer young people have been introduced to firearms. Low crime rates and a buoyant economy are also thought to have contributed to the downturn in gun ownership.
Still, the vast number of weapons already loosed upon American streets often wind up in the hands of those with insufficient training, gun control advocates say. And they stay in circulation for years.
"We will see the ultimate consequences of that down the road when we see death and injuries that are associated with the proliferation of handguns," said Tom Diaz, senior policy analyst at the Violence Policy Center, a nonprofit gun control group in Washington.
He said most guns would sit on closet shelves or in glove compartments, never used to fight crime, let alone terrorism. "What are you going to do, shoot an envelope filled with anthrax or stop a 747 with a handgun?" he asked. "It's literally crazy."
The executive director of Doctors Against Handgun Injury, Robert V. Seltzer, has said that people need to think before buying a weapon and that if they buy one, they "need to store it properly: unloaded, locked, with the ammunition stored separately and securely."
Around the country, gun instruction classes have shown significant increases in enrollment. Mr. LaPierre said the waiting period to attend courses for weapon-carrying permits had jumped to more than two months from two weeks.
At the Firing Line, a South Philadelphia gun shop and pistol range where gun sales have increased 20 percent since Sept. 11, the owner, Gregory J. Isabella, said economic fears have not stopped sales. He said he sold 58 guns in the first 20 days after the attacks, an increase of 20 percent or more over the same period last year, and sold 18,000 rounds of ammunition in the same period, an increase of more than 30 percent. Sales at his shop have steadied, but are still ahead of last year's pace. He said women were buying their own guns, or ammunition for their husbands as a Christmas stocking stuffer. Other customers, he said, come by just to shoot at the Osama bin Laden targets.
"I got him!" Mr. Isabella said he could hear shooters saying, or, "I got even with him!" He said: "It's a way to blow off steam and, perhaps, practice for some nebulous future event.
"Let's just say that personal security is now on the mind of individual citizens," Mr. Isabella said. "Definitely."

HEADLINE: Fortress New York, Falling to Time; 
Across City, Vestiges of the Days of Redcoats, Rebels and Russians

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
In the Rockaways, sand dunes ripple past underground silos that once housed nuclear-tipped missiles. On the island where New York City maintains potter's field, prisoners bury the indigent near the foundations of former Army barracks. At a Staten Island park, children dig soccer cleats into land that offers a faint outline of a former Army air field.
 Almost anywhere you go in New York City, there are vestiges of a colorful military past. 
 Today, the city is home to only one active-duty base, Fort Hamilton, at the Brooklyn foot of the Verrazano Narrows Bridge, a small garrison whose primary mission is recruiting. As late as the 1960's, however, several thousand soldiers lived on more than a half-dozen installations scattered throughout the five boroughs, continuing a tradition that has guarded against redcoats, civil unrest and cold war shenanigans. 
But the uniformed men and women standing sentinel at vulnerable locations in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks provide a rare reminder of the military's once significant presence in New York.
"There's a rich tradition, but there's a tendency to forget," said Jack Fein, the unofficial historian of Fort Totten, in Queens, which was decommissioned in 1967 and is now used primarily by the Army Reserves and the Police and Fire Departments. "You had organizations and people and museums. Tremendous. All over the city. It was military, more than you can possibly realize."
New York can certainly claim its share of military distinctions. Fort Totten was the site of the Army's earliest East Coast radar installation. Floyd Bennett Field was one of the country's busiest military airports during World War II. Abner Doubleday served at Fort Hamilton. So, too, did Stonewall Jackson, who just missed overlapping with another Confederate leader, Robert E. Lee.
But the history of the military in New York is largely a story of fortifications built out in concentric rings, away from the heart of the city, according to Russell S. Gilmore, a historian and author of a 1983 monograph, "Guarding America's Front Door: Harbor Forts in the Defense of New York City."
To defend the city, first from warships, then much later from missiles, the fortifications began with earthen berms built by the Dutch. Then they moved out to the stone forts at Liberty and Governors Islands, to the granite forts in the outer boroughs guarding the harbor, and, finally, to the underground silos on the city's fringes and in the suburbs.
For the most part, the strategy worked. In fact, before Sept. 11, the only time New York was attacked was in 1776, when the British won the Battle of Brooklyn and occupied the city for the rest of the Revolutionary War.
In the early 19th century, the military sought to protect the southern flank of New York harbor by building two sister fortifications facing each other at the Narrows: Fort Hamilton in Brooklyn and Fort Wadsworth in Staten Island. Later, the same strategy was applied to Long Island Sound on the east, with the erection of Fort Totten in Queens, and Fort Schuyler in the Bronx.
During the Civil War era, when the city already had large contingents of both Union and Confederate sympathizers, tensions climbed with the Draft Riots of the 1860's, a rash of fires, ethnic rivalries, widespread labor strife and roving, undisciplined militia units.
"There was a lawless potential, and it was truly a militarized situation," Mr. Gilmore said. "It really frightened the upper classes."
In time, New Yorkers grew accustomed to the military.
In the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn near Fort Hamilton, residents knew to remove or protect mirrors and pictures hanging on their walls on the days that the Army conducted its loud and jarring gun tests. In the 1950's and 1960's, residents within earshot of Floyd Bennett Field grew inured to the roar of Navy planes, taking off and landing, taking off and landing.
Indeed, by the early 20th century, air defense had become a vital component of New York's military makeup. During World War I, the Army relied on a small air field in Staten Island called Miller Field. Floyd Bennett Field, meanwhile, was built in 1931 as New York's first municipal airport, and was later sold to the Navy, which used it extensively during World War II.
New York had a sizable role in World War II, particularly as a transit point for supplies and enlisted men. Tens of thousands were deployed out of New York. The Brooklyn Navy Yard, where the U.S.S. Missouri was built, was probably the single largest industrial entity in the country, with 70,000 workers working three shifts, said Arnold Markoe, executive editor of the Scribner Encyclopedia of American Lives.
New York's military focus in the 1950's shifted largely to missile defense, as evidenced by the 20 or so sites throughout the metropolitan region that deployed surface-to-air Nike Ajax and Hercules missiles. But given the atmosphere of the cold war, few, if any, protested their existence so close to the urban core.
"The notion was the Russkies had these things, too, and they were a vital part of the defense of the nation's major cities," Mr. Gilmore said. 
While most of the Nike sites were in suburbs like Livingston, N.J., Orangeburg, N.Y., and Lido Beach, on Long Island, two were within the city: at Fort Tilden, in the Rockaway section of Queens, and at Hart Island, near the Bronx, which is also the home of potter's field.
Hart Island was also linked by underwater communication cable with Fort Slocum on Davids Island, perhaps a mile away in New Rochelle. And together, the 100 or so troops who lived on the islands were responsible for maintaining two underground missiles, said Donald E. Bender, an expert on Nike missiles who runs Cold War Research, a historical consulting company.
"Each missile could have been topped with a warhead as powerful as the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Japan," Mr. Bender said. "Or even more powerful. The notion of all of that nuclear firepower within the confines of New York City seems hard to believe today."
By the time the Nike program ended in 1974, the military was shrinking because of economics and politics. The Brooklyn Navy Yard closed in 1966. Six years later, Fort Tilden, Fort Wadsworth and Floyd Bennett Field were transferred to the National Park Service as part of the creation of Gateway National Recreation Area.
These days, Fort Hamilton struggles to overcome the perception that the military is now completely absent from the city. When Lt. Col. Rodney W. Gettig, a native of Boalsburg, Pa., was named its commander last year, he had never heard of it.
Since then, however, he has become the base's biggest cheerleader and salesman, securing money to renovate facilities for the 1,400 people from all branches of the military who live on the base.
"We were kind of a backwater, but we're trying to bring it up to where we can say, 'Hey, we're a big player, too,' " Colonel Gettig said.
In all, there are still about a dozen or so military installations in the New York area. Fort Wood, shaped like a star, rests at the base of the Statue of Liberty. Fort Schuyler, near the Throgs Neck Bridge, is now home to the Navy's only remaining reserve center and the State University of New York Maritime College.
The control tower still remains at Floyd Bennett Field but is littered with debris and battered chairs. The apartment building for enlisted Navy seamen stands, too, but barely: it is boarded up, with broken chairs, abandoned toys, holes everywhere.
"Kind of like an Ellis Island feel," said Lincoln Hallowell, a National Park Service ranger.
On the other side of Queens, Fort Totten still looks reasonably preserved. But the last family moved out almost two years ago. 
Rick Stricker, who lived at Fort Totten from 1968-1977 as the son of a Navy officer who helped train reservists, fondly recalled children playing with abandon in the late afternoon, then snapping to attention and saluting the flag when the public address system played "Retreat" at 5 p.m.
Four years ago, Mr. Stricker returned to Fort Totten for the first time in decades, after attending the 20-year reunion of his class at Bayside High School. Outside the officers' houses, the screened porches were in tatters. Inside, the paint from the tin ceilings was peeling.
"It had everything but the tumbleweeds rolling down the streets," said Mr. Stricker, 42, a Navy veteran himself who now runs a computer services company in western Michigan. "It was very depressing. I had to remind myself that I had some of the best memories of my life there."

HEADLINE: City to Offer Free Tickets To Brighten Broadway 

BYLINE:  By DIANE CARDWELL 

 BODY:
The Giuliani administration is buying 50,000 theater tickets to help Broadway shows, which have been hard hit since the World Trade Center attack and face even more difficult times with the typical post-New Year slowdown.
 Shortly after Sept. 11, the industry asked for government aid, according to Jed Bernstein, president of the League of American Theaters and Producers. 
 State help came in the form of $1 million for marketing to increase ticket sales throughout the winter, and city aid materialized recently in the form of the direct purchase of tickets to those shows that are in the most dire financial straits, Mr. Bernstein said. 
The seats, costing the city $50 each, for a total of $2.5 million, normally cost $60 to about $95, Mr. Bernstein said.
The ticket purchases, which were first reported on Friday by Variety, come at a time when officials are working to cut millions from the city's budget, which also suffered as revenue dropped as a result of the attacks.
The ticket purchases are intended to prop up the ailing productions as well as to bolster other spending in the city.
Mr. Bernstein said the purchases are coming in three waves.
In the first, the city bought about 16,500 tickets for December performances of six struggling shows, including "Beauty and the Beast," "Contact," "Hedda Gabler" and "The Phantom of the Opera," which were distributed to World Trade Center rescue workers, victims' families and to workers involved in the recovery effort.
But most of the tickets will be for January and February performances and will be used as part of a promotion called Spend Your Regards to Broadway, meant to stimulating tourism and shopping just after the new year.
"This is really to generate spending," Cristyne L. Nicholas, president of NYC & Company, the city's tourist board, said. "Hopefully we will soon be back to where we don't need something like this."
The program will furnish two free Broadway theater tickets to shoppers who show $500 worth of receipts dated Jan. 1 to Jan. 15 from stores, restaurants and cultural institutions, Ms. Nicholas said. Some purchases will be exempt from the promotion.
Some tickets will also go to radio stations and to retail outlets in Lower Manhattan to run similar shopping promotions, Ms. Nicholas said. 
The promotions could yield from $7.5 million to $12 million in spending in the city, she added.
Although some people have criticized the move, Ms. Nicholas and Mr. Bernstein both defended it on economic grounds, with Ms. Nicholas saying that for retailers, "January was going to be very bleak, so this is a way of generating some spending."
Mr. Bernstein agreed. "Broadway is in trouble, but no more deserving of help than anyone else," he said. "But we've always felt that the city could use Broadway as a lure to bring attention to other things, because it is so visible and it is so glamorous."

WALL STREET'S PAIN

BYLINE:  By Leslie Eaton

 BODY:
 Stockbrokers are crying in their (imported) beer, and New Yorkers of all stripes are sharing their pain. That's because 2001 bonuses will total just $10 billion, far less than last year's record $14.3 billion, according to the New York State comptroller, thanks to recession, sagging stocks and, of course, the events of Sept. 11. The missing $4.3 billion translates into fewer taxi rides, apartment buys, restaurant meals, golf lessons and Chinese food deliveries. Tax revenues and charitable donations will also take big hits.

HEADLINE: New Weapon in Discount Warehouse Wars 

BYLINE:  By IRA BRESKIN 

DATELINE: EAST FARMINGALE 

 BODY:
A SANDWICH sign heralding what may be the area's cheapest gasoline lured a steady stream of bargain-hunting drivers the other day to a recently opened gas station at the far end of Daniel Street, a dead-end road off Route 110.
 Customers said they pulled in for the rock-bottom prices. "I come here because the gas is cheap," Alexander Clement, a 60-year-old East Northport resident, said in a typical response. 
 But this nondescript 12-pump outlet is not just another off-brand gasoline retailer. BJ's Gas, the first Long Island gas station associated with a warehouse outlet, marries two routines of suburban life -- buying oodles of groceries and slaking the thirst of the insatiable creature in the driveway. 
To qualify for the advertised price -- $1.119 a gallon for regular and $1.199 a gallon for premium, as of midweek last week -- patrons must present a valid membership card for BJ's Wholesale Club, the station operator. Otherwise, they pay higher but still competitive rates: $1.259 a gallon for regular and $1.359 for premium. The corresponding average for all Long Island stations was $1.251 and $1.367, according to the Automobile Club of New York's daily survey.
Like other grocery warehouses, BJ's is famous for selling in bulk, but the gas station doesn't require you to buy 100 gallons per visit. The idea is to get shoppers into the megastore with a frequency closer to their need to fill up with gas than to their ability to go through a 24-pack of paper towels.
Danielle Ryan, 20, of Bethpage, owns a BJ's card but was filling her S.U.V. at a self-service Amoco station on Route 110 and Millbar Drive, about a half a mile up Route 110 from the BJ's discount outlet -- and paying at least 12 cents a gallon more.
Learning about the recent opening of the nearby BJ's station, Ms. Ryan said she intended to patronize it rather than the Amoco location, which she said she had chosen "because it's close to my job."
Mr. Clement said he pulled into the BJ's station regularly to fill the tank of his S.U.V. before venturing off to the BJ's Warehouse store at 123 Smith Street in East Farmingdale, less than a mile away on the other side of Route 110.
That extra jog will be a thing of the past early next month when BJ's opens a new 108,000-square-foot warehouse store adjacent to the gas station at 50 Daniel Street and closes the 15-year-old Smith Street store.
Operators of warehouse stores have been pushing to add discount gas stations like the one here because they bolster revenue and profit in this thin-margin business. The first such filling stations opened about five years ago. Now, 50 of BJ's 127 stores along the East Coast and in Ohio offer discount gasoline.
Other operators of warehouse stores on Long Island are eager to compete. "We want as many of these as we can get, as fast as we can get them," said Melissa Berryhill, a spokeswoman for Sam's Clubs, the nation's largest chain of warehouse stores. She said Sam's sold gasoline at 130 of its 495 outlets nationwide.
But neither Sam's, a subsidiary of Wal-Mart, nor the No. 2 chain, Costco Wholesale, plans to add a gas outlet to a projected or existing Long Island store. Costco has stores in Lawrence, Melville and Westbury; Sam's sole Long Island store is in Medford. BJ's other Long Island stores are in Westbury, Riverhead, East Setauket and Islandia, with a sixth scheduled to open next month in Freeport.
Competitors may have trouble matching BJ's venture into Long Island gasoline sales because of the limited space available near existing local outlets and arduous zoning restrictions that must be addressed when space exists.
David Blumenfeld, a vice president of Blumenfeld Development Group of Syosset, which developed the BJ's store scheduled to open early next month, said the gas station added three months to what would have been a six-month process of getting permits from the Town of Babylon. The station opened Nov. 2.
The average BJ's filling station sold 4.2 million gallons of gasoline last year, the company said. That's about five times the volume of the average corner station, according to several retailers.
Though BJ's did not release figures on the profitability of its gasoline sideline, Richard Galanti, chief financial officer of Costco, said gas, while not a loss leader, was a low-margin item for warehouse store operators.
The warehouse gasoline outlets cut costs by offering only two grades of fuel, not the three typically offered by competing stand-alone gas stations, and doing no advertising, he said. It's all self-service. There are no mechanics on duty. And at BJ's in East Farmingdale only credit and debit cards are accepted, though the station will take cash once the adjacent store opens.
However, Mr. Galanti said that each $1 of gasoline sales generated an additional 40 cents in incremental annual revenue. That 40 cents includes cash generated from enlisting additional new members, higher retention of existing members (last year 84 percent of BJ's family members chose to renew) and additional purchases by shoppers, some of whom visit more often.
Annual memberships, which are $40 for a family and modestly more for a small-business customer, flow right to the bottom line and account for much of the warehouse store operator's profit, said Howard Davidowitz of Davidowitz & Associates of New York, a retail consulting firm.
"We continue to experience incremental sales and new memberships upon opening a gas station at one of our clubs," BJ's said in a recent filing. "We believe that the availability of a gas station has often motivated existing members to shop more frequently, an important goal of most BJ's merchandising and marketing activities."
Shopping frequency is a big issue because warehouse stores are a destination location, drawing traffic from a much larger radius than the two-mile arc addressed by the typical supermarket, Mr. Davidowitz said.
Operators of giant no-frills warehouse stores also like adjacent bargain gas outlets because they reinforce the value-pricing image they're trying to project.
"There is a higher awareness by consumers of gas prices as opposed to other items," Mr. Davidowitz said. "Gas is a perfect add-on business."
The discount gas offering helps offset the fact that warehouse stores lose appeal over time. BJ's said that following the third year of operations, its stores typically increased annual sales by 9 percent, down from 12 percent gains registered in each of the previous two. And very mature stores, those almost 10 years old, typically boost annual sales by only 4 percent, essentially matching inflation. 
But Charles Bietche, 41, of Bay Shore, who was visiting BJ's pumps for the first time, said cheap gasoline was a modest incentive to visit an adjacent warehouse store. "If I need gas and I'm here filling up near the store, I would probably go in," he said.

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about an East Farmingdale filling station operated by BJ's, a discount warehouse outlet, reversed two prices. On Dec. 12, customers with BJ's membership cards were paying $1.259 a gallon for premium gasoline, and nonmembers were paying $1.199 for regular.

HEADLINE: THE ECONOMY; 
Post-Holiday Blues Come Early

BYLINE:  By SUSAN WARNER 

 BODY:
FROM the malls to Main Streets -- and New Jersey has more than its share -- shoppers usually fling themselves into the holiday routine and figure the bills will come due later. This year, they're coming due earlier.
 The news seemed to crystalize last week when Moody's Investors Services forecast that the New Jersey economy would face a sharp downturn over the next 18 months. In the clearest sign yet of the state's weakening fiscal condition, Moody's decided to change the state's rating outlook from stable to negative -- placing the state on notice that its bond rating could be downgraded in the future. 
 Moreover, the agency said that the state was likely to exhaust its budget reserve fund of $1.2 billion this fiscal year and could face a deficit of $2.4 billion next year. 
Not surprisingly, the bleak forecast intensified the dispute between Acting Gov. Donald T. DiFrancesco and Governor-elect Jim McGreevey over the extent of the state's budget shortfall, but that invariably is the background music that plays whenever a new administration is poised to take over.
For commuters, however, the news was not Muzak but more like brakes screeching.
After holding the line for more than 10 years, New Jersey Transit announced last Wednesday that it would seek a 10 percent fare increase -- to take effect April 1 -- to help close its $3.1 billion budget gap. In addition, in each of the following five years, automatic fare increases would be pegged to the inflation rate.
Moving with a swiftness not always evident to its passengers, the agency scheduled six public hearings on Jan. 2, and could approve the increases at a board meeting as early as Jan. 7.
The fare increase is expected to generate an additional $44 million over the first year, though it is only part of a larger six-year plan to close the budget gap. Operating expenses are up 67 percent since the last fare increase in 1990, but after adjusting for inflation, fares have declined 29 percent, the agency said.
Also last week, the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission, which manages 20 Delaware River bridges, approved its first fare increase since 1988.
The increases -- part of a proposed $526 million 10-year capital improvement plan -- will more than triple revenue, to $106 million from $31.5 million. The highest toll increase will be at the Interstate 78 Bridge, where the toll will rise to $1 from 50 cents. 
The gloom in the public sector comes at a time when consumers are facing their own perils as they grapple with job security, shrinking income from smaller bonuses and stock market gains that have dried up. Of course, all of that has been exacerbated by the attack on the World Trade Center, which hit New Jersey disproportionately harder than the rest of the nation.
This year, the timing of the gaps in the state and transit budgets seem particularly cruel. One question that keeps arising is why the government and transportation agencies did not set money aside or raise fares gradually during the boom times, when consumers were better equipped to bear them.
"Maybe they should plan for the future a little better," said Michele Baccare of Cherry Hill. "When things were that good, there's only one way to go. You knew this was going to happen."
The state's budget problems are related to the sharp, unexpected increase in revenue due to capital gains and other taxes associated with the stock market boom of the late 1990's. But that revenue dried up with the collapse of stock prices and the recession.
To be sure, other states are experiencing similar revenue shortfalls, but they are exaggerated in New Jersey, several economists say, because of the state's progressive income tax, high level of income and exposure to the stock markets.
"In the last few years, state governments received huge windfalls," said Jim Diffley, a regional economist with DRI-WEFA, an econometric firm in Eddystone, Pa. "They knew this income stream could not be counted on to last forever. What they didn't know, and could not have known, was that it would happen all at once. They didn't know the pattern, and by the way, they still don't."
As for the budget gap, economists are forecasting a mild recession for New Jersey that could ease the crisis by 2003.
Gus Faucher, who tracks the state economy at Economy.com, an econometrics firm in Chester, Pa., said his firm predicted that the New Jersey economy, like that of the rest of the nation, would emerge from the current recession in late spring.
Oddly, Mr. Faucher noted, New Jersey benefited somewhat from the Sept. 11 disaster in that the state gained about 15,000 jobs in September and October, most of them finance jobs coming from New York City following the attacks.
As for the transportation finance problems, he said they were more reflective of long-term difficulties rather than the current recession.
James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers, said the gap in transit financing stemmed in part from the failure to add capacity in the 1990's while the state added 585,000 jobs.
"We systematically underinvested in transportation," Mr. Hughes said. "Unfortunately, that's part of the political reality."
He pointed out that three years ago, a plan by Gov. Christie Whitman to raise the gasoline tax to finance mass transit and highway improvements failed in the Legislature. During that time New Jersey Transit used federal funds earmarked for capital improvement to close operating deficits, which Mr. Hughes termed unwise but allowable.
"It's been a real struggle to meet the capital needs that we have," he said. "Then the events of Sept. 11 have added enormous pressure. The absence of PATH has made the whole situation much more visible."
But Joel Naroff, chief economist at Commerce Bank, said the reality was that transit boards were reluctant to raise fares -- in good times or bad --because of the danger of losing riders.
"Nobody wants to raise prices when demand is weak," said Mr. Naroff. "But there always reaches a point where you simply have to do it."
Shifting his attention from the transit difficulties to the state's budget, Mr. Hughes said the problems awaiting Mr. McGreevey resembled the situation in which Jim Florio found himself when he was elected governor a decade ago. Faced with budget problems, Mr. Florio raised taxes, and effectively ended his political career.
"That was a signature event that sill reverberates in the State House," Mr. Hughes said.
In this instance, he said, the timing might spare Mr. McGreevey a period of finger-pointing. "Clearly he's coming into office at a time when everybody knows we're in a recession, and Sept. 11 is absorbing a lot of the blame," said Mr. Hughes. "There's less likely to be as many accusations about who caused the downturn."
As for the disturbing economic news, Mr. Naroff said more could be on the way. If the state makes deep cuts to balance its budget, more expenditures will fall to municipal governments, which finance operations with property taxes, perhaps leading to a wave of property tax increases.
"It's not happening yet," Mr. Naroff said, "but there is a trickling down. Any economic slowdown hits at every level of government."

TV's, DVD's: All Yours, But First Do the Math

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
DOES John Madden have a deal for you!
 He can sell you a five-disc DVD player. Or he can sell you a portable stereo. He can even sell you a 27-inch television on which you can watch him, the country's most famous football commentator, announce this year's Super Bowl. 
 And don't think you're going to pay any old price, either. That DVD player regularly sells for $250, but Mr. Madden can get it to you for only $1,000. The stereo? It costs about $350 at the Wiz but $1,500 from Mr. Madden. The TV may be the best deal. It is only $2,000, compared with $450 normally.
All of these so-called deals are available at Rent-a-Center, a company that uses Mr. Madden as its public face and that is easily the nation's largest retailer in a category known as rent to own. Rent-a-Center, based in Plano, Tex., operates 2,400 stores mainly in poorer areas, often selling to people who do not have credit cards. In exchange for regular payments -- $24 a week over almost two years for the TV, coming to $2,000 in all -- customers can buy electronics, appliances and furniture. If they stop making payments, they must return the products. 
Rent-a-Center is one kind of business that flourishes in a recession, as people are laid off or lose overtime hours and become unable to plunk down $450 all at once. Mitchell E. Fadel, the company's president, said recently on CNNfn that a downturn "actually helps us from a revenue standpoint."
The same cannot be said, however, about the effect that the rent-to-own industry has on the American economy. In fact, at a time when even President Bush has urged people to spend more of their money, Rent-a-Center offers an important reminder that some kinds of consumer spending can do more long-term harm than short-term good. 
Paying $2,000 for a $450 product is never a good idea. It is a particularly dangerous one when debt levels are high and layoffs are rising.
As Mr. Madden tells it, however, rent to own is a great deal. "Hey, Rent-a-Center has a holiday gift for you," he says, playing off his folksy blue-collar image, in a recent TV commercial trumpeting a discount. "But you got to be lively and quick."
Rent-a-Center executives credit Mr. Madden, their spokesman since last year, for raising Rent-a-Center's profile and lifting sales. This summer, Fortune magazine named the company one the fastest-growing in the country.
Why are there so many customers? Some people, lacking the income and credit history to get credit cards, feel they have no option. They need a dishwasher, and they know a store that will sell them one.
But rent-to-own companies have also succeeded in masking the true cost of their products. New York City requires electronics stores to list the standard retail price of a product, but at a Rent-A-Center in Brooklyn last week, that part of the price tag was blank. Christopher A. Korst, the company's general counsel, said it was talking to city officials about how to comply with the law.
The industry has also persuaded most states to treat its contracts more like rental agreements than loans -- even though customers eventually buy 70 percent of all products they rent, according to a survey of 12,000 households by the Federal Trade Commission. (Mr. Korst said the portion is much lower.) Thanks to those state laws, Rent-a-Center does not need to list the underlying interest rate -- which can exceed 200 percent, making even credit card rates look good. 
"They don't want it to be a free market in which consumers are making knowing decisions," said Attorney General James E. Doyle of Wisconsin, who has sued the industry to reveal more information. "Let's have a competitive marketplace."
Such tactics have helped consumers win tens of millions of dollars from the company, in court settlements and verdicts, over the last decade.
Rent-a-Center executives say the company's size is its best defense. People obviously like the store enough to continue patronizing it, and they can return the products at any time without penalty. 
Mr. Madden has a similar view, his agent, Sandy Montag, said. "Rent-a-Center provides a good service," Mr. Montag said. "They are a successful public company, and we have heard a lot of positive feedback from many happy customers."
But consider this: if a family saves $20 a week for two years, it could buy a large TV after five months, a stereo after four more months, a five-disc DVD player after three more months and still have almost $1,000 left. At Rent-a-Center, it would get the TV immediately but nothing else.
Which is better for shoppers and for the economy? Faced with such a question during one of his football broadcasts, the famously straight-talking Mr. Madden would doubtless have a pithy answer.

Al Qaeda's Last Legs, Preparing for Peace, Holiday Shadows

BYLINE:  By ROBERT D. McFADDEN 

 BODY:
The war in Afghanistan moved inexorably toward a climax. American warplanes bombed the ridge positions and cave and tunnel hideouts of Al Qaeda's remnant forces in the eastern mountains around Tora Bora, and on the ground the Afghan militia was closing in on what may be Osama bin Laden's last redoubt.
 RESISTANCE CRUMBLING -- Afghan commanders said that ridge-to-ridge and cave-to-cave searches had led to the capture of 50 Al Qaeda fighters and that bodies of 33 others had been found. That left 300 to 1,000 enemy fighters in the mountains, ravines and man-made tunnels. With limited supplies of food and ammunition, they had only two options -- give up or fight to the death. 
 There was still no clear sign that Osama bin Laden was in the area, but if so his options were also limited: run or be killed or caught. There was a plan in place if he was captured alive, but American officials refused to say what it was. As for Al Qaeda prisoners, some might be taken to Kandahar airport, where American marines were building a detention camp for 300.
ON THE MOVE -- Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld was on a tour of Central Asia, with stops in the former Soviet republics of Azerbaijan, Armenia and Georgia to offer military assistance in return for using their airspace in the war. He said American and Afghan forces had made advances in Tora Bora, and had begun the dangerous business of clearing caves and tunnels.
The videotape of Mr. bin Laden gloating over, and admitting responsibility for, the killing of more than 3,000 people on Sept. 11 was still making news. A senior Saudi official said that the mysterious dinner guest pictured with Mr. bin Laden was Khaled al-Harbi, a legless, 38-year-old Saudi and a veteran of conflicts in Afghanistan, Bosnia and Chechnya.
WINNING THE PEACE -- With the end of the war approaching, some extraordinary events are coming up. In Kabul, Hamid Karzai is to become prime minister, the first person to take power in Afghanistan peacefully in 30 years. That will be the easy part. The hard part will be getting a bewildering coalition of tribes, warlords, political parties and nations to work together to rebuild the nation. That task will be compounded by the worst drought in 50 to 100 years. For three years it has stricken a country where farming is 80 percent of the economy: blowing away seeds and soil, drying up wells and rivers, killing vegetation and livestock. Unless winter brings rain, experts foresee tragedy in efforts to feed millions and restore stability.
WAR STORIES -- There are countless tales in wartime Afghanistan. Take, for example, the five men imprisoned by the Taliban in Kandahar for "political" offenses. Actually, there were 1,800, but most were freed when the city was liberated. The five -- Arabs, Russians, Chechens perhaps -- are in limbo. They, too, were released, but are still being held because officials say they could be mistaken for foreigners who aided the Taliban or Al Qaeda, and killed.
After 20 years of war, guns are more common than books, and it is easy to forget that Afghanistan has a rich cultural tradition. At the Herat Literary Association most days, artists and writers meet to read and talk about Persian and Afghan poets, the great writers who were shaped by the literary riches of poverty, drought, political and religious oppression and ethnic hatreds.
HOLIDAYS AND GUNS -- Christmas is little more than a week away, and America seems to crave the warmth of the holiday hearth. But the effects of Sept. 11 go on relentlessly, especially in the homes of the thousands of families who lost loved ones, or jobs, in the terrorist attacks. Parents say the rituals of the season -- the cards, the tree, the decorations and presents -- are just too much this year, but they are going ahead for the sake of the children. It doesn't take an expert to note that the holidays, with their obligatory good cheer, can magnify grief. One trade center widow killed herself last week, and for others there is holiday sorrow and depression.
Another Sept. 11 legacy is fear. Worried about safety, many Americans are arming themselves. Federal statistics and other evidence suggest that sales of guns and ammunition have risen sharply, between 9 and 22 percent in the last three months. Officials say the proliferation of guns is troubling because many wind up in the hands of people who lack training. Weapons classes are also growing, but guns are rarely used against criminals, let alone terrorists.

Afghan Drought Inflicts Its Own Misery

BYLINE:  By ANDREW C. REVKIN

 BODY:
The monumental task of rebuilding Afghanistan after the war has been made far more difficult, experts say, by a problem that would have existed even without the Taliban and Osama bin Laden: the drought that has gripped the country and much of southwestern Asia for three years.
 There is a chance that the drought -- the worst in much of the region for 50 to 100 years -- may end this winter, experts on global climate and agriculture said in interviews over the last week. But they warned that damage to fields, grazing land and water supplies would linger for years, hampering efforts to feed millions of famished refugees and restore Afghanistan's shattered economy. 
 The damage has not been confined to Afghanistan. Throughout much of southwestern Asia, soil and seeds have blown away, vegetation has baked brown, livestock have been slaughtered and wells and rivers have run dry. Parts of northwestern Iran have had no measurable rainfall in 30 months, and more than 200,000 nomadic herders there have lost their source of income as flocks of sheep and goats have been slaughtered or died. Cities and villages have instituted water rationing. 
The wide reach of the drought means that Afghan refugees heading west to Iran or east to the dry side of Pakistan have found little comfort. At one camp along the Pakistan border, well drillers had to bore a mile deep before reaching the greatly sunken water table, relief workers reported.
When the war ends, political tensions are bound to rise as Afghanistan rebuilds its northern provinces and begins drawing more water out of the Amu Darya, which forms part of its borders with three former Soviet republics -- Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. The river is already taxed to the limit, with every drop of its annual flow of 19 cubic miles of water -- nearly four times the flow of the Colorado -- siphoned by irrigation and for water supplies before reaching the shriveled Aral Sea.
"In this region, water is more important than money," said Dr. Michael H. Glantz, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., who has studied the Amu Darya. 
But the continuing lack of water and food will pose particularly daunting challenges in Afghanistan itself, where farming is the basis for more than 80 percent of the economy. Even after a generation of warfare and violence, the drought remains "the single most important factor influencing the Afghan economy," Kofi Annan, the United Nations secretary general, said in a report to the General Assembly this month.
The latest assessments remain bleak, even with the chance that a change in global weather patterns -- which many scientists say is long overdue -- could bring rain and snow to Afghanistan this winter. 
During the wheat-planting season, which started in October and ended two weeks ago, rainfall across the northern provinces, where most wheat is grown, was extremely scant, according to a report released last week by the Foreign Agricultural Service of the Department of Agriculture.
For the wheat-growing regions, the report said, cumulative precipitation from Oct. 1 to Dec. 12 was only 29 percent of the average for the period. Without rain during planting, seed rarely sprouts in the spring. The lack of rainfall in October and November came as a blow to farmers because September -- just before the planting season -- was tantalizingly wet.
Even the temperature has conspired against the Afghan farmers. Runoff from melting snows and spring rains supplies most of the region's rivers and irrigation systems, but a string of unusually warm winters melted mountain snows, causing "ill-timed runoff" too early to be of any help, the report said. This month, the mountain weather is warmer than usual once again.
The farmers' problems have been compounded by extensive damage to irrigation canals and pipelines from the continuing warfare.
If the drought persists, agriculture experts say, a further consequence could be more planting of opium poppies, which tolerate dry conditions far better than wheat.
By the middle of January, the United Nations, the World Bank and other international institutions hope to create a plan for rebuilding the country. But experts say the drought will prove a lasting hindrance.
"The deficit in groundwater is so severe that even with a normal or above-normal winter, you'd have to expect a two to three year recovery period," said Dr. Matthew A. Barlow, an author of an analysis of the drought by the International Research Institute for Climate Prediction at Columbia University. "In some instances," he added, "that would be a little on the optimistic side."
The report (available online at http://iri.columbia.edu) says the drought may be linked to unusual conditions thousands of miles away: raised temperatures in the western Pacific and frequent rainstorms over the Indian Ocean. Indirectly, the scientists say, these changes appear to be preventing winter storms from sweeping east out of the Mediterranean.
A preliminary analysis by the Columbia scientists suggests that the last severe drought in the region, from 1970 to 1972, occurred when similar ocean conditions developed. That dry spell, State Department experts say, helped topple a previous Afghan government, that of the former king, Mohammad Zahir Shah, in 1973.
The ocean condition is a rare variation on La Nina, part of a regular cycle of Pacific warming and cooling episodes that can influence weather patterns around the world. In a typical La Nina year, unusually cool water covers the eastern Pacific along the Equator, contrasting with warm water to the west. For the last several years, the Pacific has been locked in La Nina conditions, but the western waters have been particularly warm. 
Many scientists say the Pacific is overdue for a shift back to the opposite pattern, called El Nino, in which warm water spreads east toward South America. But that has not happened yet, and La Nina could hang on for another winter. 
If that happens and the Columbia scientists are right, Afghanistan's plight could go on even longer. Still, they say more research will be required to confirm the relationship between La Nina and the drought. 
Looking ahead, climate experts said an important part of any rebuilding of Afghanistan would be prompt re-establishment of basic, regular measurements of precipitation and other weather conditions. No local weather data have been collected for several years, and without a long-term record it is difficult to spot trends that might indicate a return of drought conditions, said Dr. Barlow at Columbia.
Eventually, Dr. Barlow said, researchers hope to be able to use close monitoring of telltale shifts in global patterns to predict future severe droughts in the region and help governments and relief agencies gird for battle.
The same feature of the drought that made it so destructive -- its vast size -- also raises scientists' hopes that the forces that conspired to create it can be discerned.
"The good thing about its size is that it's probably more than just a chance occurrence," Dr. Barlow said. "The larger scale something is, the more likely it is that we can understand and then predict it."

HEADLINE: Show Us the Money 

BYLINE:  By Frank Bruni; Frank Bruni is a staff writer for the magazine based in Washington.

 BODY:
It must gall her a little -- to come begging at the door of a colleague who once articulated the possibility, or maybe really the wish, that lightning would strike her before she took her seat in the United States Senate, sparing Republicans her dread company. But right now, Hillary Clinton needs Trent Lott. She needs him and any other senator who can be made to rain dollars upon New York, which is thirsty for them like almost never before. So she walks with a hopeful, beseeching smile into Lott's private conference room and takes a seat next to his, although not too close.
 Chuck Schumer, on Lott's other side, presses in tighter. He doesn't carry the kind of baggage she does, and it has always been his way to be more aggressive than his peers, turning his insistence into an edge. The mere fact of Clinton's presence seems to sharpen this instinct, in ways good and bad. When Schumer addresses Lott, he presses in tighter still. 
 "Our situation in New York is this," he says, cutting to the chase. "We're all trying to put on a nice face, but it gets worse every day." This is his first card: the city's stoicism and bravery, which can elicit only sympathy. Then Schumer plays his second: the fact that New York did not merely happen to find itself in the path of destruction but was put there because of what the city means to America. "You know," he tells Lott, "the attack on New York was an attempt to destroy our financial capital, to destroy our country." His third and final card is the simplest of all: desperation. "If we don't do something now," Schumer warns, "we are in trouble."
There is not that much left for Clinton to say, other than to stress that New York's downfall would not be isolated and that its economic pain is every American's. "The ripple effects," she says, "are really going out throughout the entire country." Her voice is steady but also a little weary. She has sung this refrain so many times already.
You would think that none of this would be necessary. That the images alone -- planes slicing through two of the world's tallest skyscrapers, terrified people scrambling for their lives -- would open federal coffers as wide as New York could want them to be. That the statistics -- millions of square feet of office space crumbled, more casualties than Pearl Harbor -- would seal the deal.
But by this morning in early November when the two Democratic senators from New York visit the leader of the Senate's Republican minority, they have learned that memories fade, that new priorities emerge and that New York, even now, is not an easy magnet for national sympathy. President Bush's initial promise of $20 billion in aid has turned slippery, which is why, in a conversation an hour before their meeting with Lott, Senator Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat, told Schumer and Clinton: "I would urge you to kind of think how you could make America even prouder of New York and buy into New York as a national asset. A lot of Americans, deep down, have a certain. . . . "
"We know, we know," Schumer said, halting Baucus's sentence before its inevitable and dispiriting conclusion.
In Lott's office, Schumer and Clinton are getting fresh reminders. About a dozen business, labor and political leaders have come down from New York to show support for the senators' case and offer their own testimonials to the city's pain. Lott's response suggests a skepticism at odds with his genial grin. He trots out a metaphor, saying that a city's attempt to rebound from catastrophe is like a "jet going off a carrier." The pilot, he explains, thinks that the plane will plummet into the water but then, remarkably, feels it rise. The moral seems to be that premonitions of ruin always overestimate the danger.
A member of the city's delegation refers to New Yorkers in neighborhoods like Battery Park City who were forced to flee their apartments, and Lott's interjection demonstrates just how little he -- and many other federal lawmakers -- understand New York. "When I went there with Hillary and Chuck," he says, referring to a trip to ground zero that a group of senators made, "they talked about getting people back in their homes. And I looked around and said, 'What homes?' Because when you say 'home,' I think of a free-standing building." What Schumer and Clinton were drawing his attention to, he recalls, were high-rises. "I never thought of them as homes," he concedes. "But they are."
This is what Schumer and Clinton are up against, and it confronts them more squarely than it does any other politician involved in the fight for New York. When it comes to federal aid, their stations in Washington give them votes and a kind of internal influence that Governor Pataki, Mayor Giuliani and Mayor-elect Bloomberg don't have. Additionally, the Senate, under Democratic control, is a more likely engine of munificence than either the Republican-controlled House or the Bush administration. Until Sept. 11, Clinton says, their days were "a multitasking kaleidoscope of issues and places and people." Now there is this one enormous battle, which trumps all the others. So they game out their talking points and legislative strategies and carom around Capitol Hill, pleading and persuading. And they do it side by side, or at least they try to, which is one of the trickiest parts of all. 
They are alike in their willfulness and ambition, but there are other, crucial differences. Over a quarter-century, he ground his way from the State Assembly to the House of Representatives and then to the Senate, only to look up, in his third year, and see a new partner with no prior experience in elective office but a hold on the public's attention that he cannot match. She spent much of her marriage and many of her eight years as first lady smiling and nodding as the man in front of her sucked most of the oxygen out of the air, only to find herself in another kind of union where her best bet for getting along is to smile, nod and take very deep breaths.
It makes for an interesting match and awkward moments, like a news conference on the last day of October, when Schumer and Clinton introduce legislation to foster cooperation between the F.B.I. and local law-enforcement agencies. Schumer speaks first, his privilege as the senior senator. Clinton speaks next. Then both step to the side of the lectern so that other senators can speak, and as the television cameras roll and nearly a dozen reporters watch, Schumer leans over and picks at a stray thread or speck of lint on the jacket of Clinton's red Oscar de la Renta pantsuit, pointing out an imperfection in her armor that no one else noticed. She tucks the errant material into a pocket and silently thanks him, but she seems to be smiling with only her teeth.
bout a week after the discussion with Lott, I join Schumer and Clinton for dinner at a French restaurant on Capitol Hill. They have already talked to each other several times earlier in the day, so she knows that he is trying to fight back an incipient cold and tells him she is concerned about it. "Let's get you some onion soup," she says, and with that she leads the way up a flight of stairs to a private room in the back. This is her place, with pastel walls and pastoral watercolors; his is a brightly lit, sparsely decorated Chinese joint just a few blocks away.
I ask them when and how they met.
"I remember the first time that I really knew who Chuck was, and that was in '94, during the gun debate about the Brady bill and the assault-gun ban," Clinton says. She recalls meetings in the White House during which her husband, Schumer and Democratic Congressional leaders wondered if they could hold fast for gun control against pressure from the National Rifle Association and the qualms of Democrats from rural states.
Schumer chimes in, noting that a few of the leaders wanted to cave. "The president didn't know what to do," he says. "And I said, 'Mr. President, if we back off, we'll become a laughingstock in America.' And she" -- he glances toward Clinton -- was always backing us up. Always helping. Always. And the president didn't back off. And it worked."
"And we lost the Congress," she adds with a rueful laugh -- a defeat that many political analysts agree was largely due to gun control.
They are in many ways natural political allies. They believe in an activist government. They get whipped up by causes. They do not like to surrender. For these reasons and others, they have long respected each other, and each has aided the other's career. In 1998, when Schumer challenged Al D'Amato in one of the most intense, expensive Senate races in history, Clinton came to New York repeatedly to stump for Schumer. This was during the whole Monica mess, as humiliation drove her popularity to a peculiar peak. The crowds adored her.
"The last few weeks," Schumer remembers, "I would call her every few days and say, 'You've got to come in, you've got to come in."' She did, four times in all. It was partly her success during those appearances that kindled the idea among Democrats that she should run for New York's other Senate seat, the one that Daniel Patrick Moynihan was poised to vacate in 2000.
During her campaign, Schumer stood with her at a few crucial times. As she was trying to mend fences with Jews in New York, he accompanied her to a Salute to Israel parade, where some members of the crowd lining Fifth Avenue shouted "Go back to Arkansas!" when she passed. "He was wondering when it would be over," said Senator Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat who lives during the workweek in the same fraternity-style Washington town house as Schumer and two other lawmakers. "At the end, she turned to him and said, 'That wasn't so bad.' I mean, this is a woman who has been tested."
Schumer knew all along that having her as a partner in the Senate would be tough for him, and so did his friends. At his 50th birthday party a year ago, the running theme in the jokes told by the people who roasted him was that Schumer, an inveterate presshound who is easily best in breed, would be driven crazy by the ever-present scrum of reporters around her. "This was a collision waiting to happen," Durbin says, hastening to add that in his view, Schumer and Clinton have worked admirably to avoid any carnage.
It is an axiom that lawmakers from the same state and same party have worse relationships than lawmakers from the same state and different parties, because they delve into the same issues and depend on the same supporters. Lawmakers who are at similar points in their careers and trade on similar strengths have worse relationships still. Schumer, now 51, a Harvard-educated lawyer who ranks 80th in Senate seniority, prides himself on his drive, intelligence and detailed mastery of policy. Clinton, 54, a Yale-educated lawyer who ranks 97th, prides herself on precisely the same attributes. "These are two thoroughbreds, not plow horses, and putting them in the same harness is probably a feat worthy of great trainers," says John Podesta, a White House chief of staff during the Clinton administration.
But Clinton's posture of resolute humility as she went about her Senate business helped to smooth over potential rough spots. Determined to prove that she was not on some giddy star trip, she mostly kept her head down and got to work, almost never missing votes or committee meetings, no matter how tedious. Even Senator Peter Fitzgerald, an Illinois Republican whom Clinton attacked when she campaigned for his opponent, Carol Moseley-Braun, now professes respect for her. "She's not just a Democratic figurehead," Fitzgerald says. "She's an everyday working senator." For the first eight months of her tenure, Clinton consistently turned down invitations to prattle away on the Sunday morning talk shows. She said no to CNN, no to Tim Russert.
Then came Sept. 11, and she started staying yes. It was not only appropriate now; it was mandatory, because getting help for New York meant broadcasting the city's horror to the rest of the country. Schumer was invited on many programs, too, but Clinton was probably more conspicuous. She had been all bottled up, contained by her new and carefully constructed identity as New York's hardworking junior senator, not a national spokeswoman. Now there was no difference between the two. The events of Sept. 11 uncorked her.
A day in mid-October when I went to Capitol Hill to see both of them yielded a telling contrast. Exiled from his suite of offices in the anthrax-shuttered Hart building, Schumer met with a half-dozen aides in his town house's dimly lighted living room, where two beds -- his and that of Representative William Delahunt, a Massachusetts Democrat -- are wedged in among a motley collection of couches. (Durbin and Representative George Miller, a California Democrat, sleep in the two rooms upstairs.) From this unglamorous warren, he telephoned lawmakers and federal officials.
Clinton, meanwhile, stood outside the Capitol, in brilliant sunshine, doing an interview with Ted Koppel for ABC's "Nightline." A crowd of reporters, including a crew from the BBC, watched and waited, then descended on her, after which several tourists corralled her for a picture.
In private, Clinton had in fact been trading on her political celebrity for some time. Shortly after she moved in February into her $2.85 million house in Washington, made affordable by her $8 million book advance, she began using it for fund-raising events for Democrats, establishing herself as perhaps the party's second most potent draw for donors -- her husband being its first. She played host at a benefit that helped Maria Cantwell, a Democrat just elected to the Senate from Washington State, erase about $150,000 of her campaign debt. She raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. For her political action committee, Hillpac, which she started in January, she has amassed a sum estimated to exceed $1.1 million.
Schumer, who had never been much of a national party fund-raiser, was not about to compete with her on that score, and nothing she was doing threatened his own fund-raising for himself. He already has an estimated $8 million for his reelection campaign in 2004 -- nearly half what he spent in 1998. Besides, in Democratic circles in New York, he has as much clout as Clinton does. Neither has sought the kind of control over the party that D'Amato wielded over state Republicans; both prefer not to take sides in Democratic primaries and stayed out of the recent mayor's race until Mark Green won the runoff against Fernando Ferrer. Some Democrats say that Schumer and Clinton may have a more difficult time maintaining distance from the governor's race, because minority resentment over Ferrer's fate may put pressure on them to help Carl McCall, who is black, in his campaign against Andrew Cuomo. Schumer doesn't like Cuomo much, according to political insiders, who also say that despite the fact that Cuomo served in her husband's cabinet, Clinton has no special attachment to him, either. Still, the senators are likely to resist making a public show of support for McCall. "We will cross that bridge when we come to it," Schumer says.
Schumer cannot do as much financially to boost state Democrats as Clinton, but he remains a less polarizing figure. This was reflected in a state poll in early October, when his job approval rating climbed to 69 percent, 10 points above hers. A higher percentage of New York voters had a favorable impression of him than of her, while a higher percentage had an unfavorable impression of her than of him. Their political bases are different. Hers is narrower, but deep: she taps especially fervent support among women, minorities and party activists. He works a broader, more centrist spectrum.
Before Sept. 11, there was plenty of space between them. She used her positions on the Senate committees on labor, health and education and on the environment as platforms to push for more public school teachers and to expose hidden health hazards. He used his chairmanship of the Senate subcommittee on the courts to call publicly for a new approach to judicial confirmations, one that openly took ideology into account rather than shrouding that concern in investigations into nominees' private lives.
But after Sept. 11, their turf abruptly converged. Both stood to be judged on one thing: how much federal help they got for New York City's recovery -- how much bacon they could bring home. They had a shared investment in the same endeavor, which made each more vulnerable to the other's effectiveness and gave each an interest in the same patch of foreground. This was the context for what happened early on Sept. 13, a rare semipublic glimpse of naked friction between the two. On the Senate floor, she announced that they would be asking for $20billion for New York. Schumer had not yet committed to a strategy of making such a figure public, according to several Democrats privy to the incident, and blew up at her in a room just off the Senate floor, yelling loudly enough so that people outside could hear. Some Democrats believe he felt usurped and upstaged.
Schumer, talking in general about events since the terrorist attacks, says that he has never nursed such a sustained, intense worry about every step being just right, nor has he experienced such a profound sense of obligation, a word that Clinton also uses. Both describe a feeling of pushing a very big rock up a very steep hill, with the summit nowhere in sight. "It will be the primary obligation for my term," Clinton says, meaning the next five years. Construction costs and lost corporate revenue, dollars and cents -- these are what now obsess them, to the point where they sometimes sound as much like accountants as politicians.
oney became their fixation just 36 hours after the terrorists struck. They were in Manhattan on the night of Wednesday, Sept. 12, when their aides telephoned them with disturbing news. The evolving $20 billion emergency package of federal aid -- for defense, intelligence operations and the areas hit hardest by the attacks -- did not have any guaranteed appropriation for New York. Polly Trottenberg, Schumer's legislative director, put it to him bluntly: this was a big problem.
Schumer, Clinton and their staffs began doing careful reconnaissance, working the phones to gauge how generous House and Senate leaders were inclined to be. They were led to believe that $20 billion might be more of a floor than a ceiling and that New York could get a significant allotment. Huddling in a van that Clinton uses to toodle around New York, Schumer and Clinton tried to reach Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the majority leader.
"I dial Daschle, and we each -- we get him, because he's at home," Schumer says. "Fortunately, he picks up. I'm saying a sentence -- I'm handing the phone to Hillary, she's saying a sentence." Daschle signaled a willingness to fight for whatever the senators deemed necessary, which turned out to be a separate $20 billion for New York alone. Back in Washington the next day, Clinton placed an early-morning call to Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, whom she had presciently and profitably turned into a mentor. He, too, pledged to help.
They could now go to the Bush administration with some powerful backing. They had a meeting scheduled with the president on Thursday afternoon and were not sure at first that they should hit him up for an exact amount -- it defied the usual etiquette for such an encounter. But these were not usual times, and when they learned that Bush would be visiting downtown Manhattan on Friday, they figured that he would prefer to go there with headlines trumpeting his generosity, not his stinginess. So they decided to ask him not simply for help, but for $20 billion of it.
Neither senator had a close relationship with Bush, but Schumer had a less loaded history with him, and he took the lead. Although Daschle's aides had told Bush's advisers what the senators would be requesting, a senior administration official who was in the Oval Office that day says he does not think the information had reached Bush, and Bush was hearing the $20 billion figure for the first time. Schumer recalls: "You could almost see in his mind he was saying, 'This is a lot of money.' But this is why I have a little faith in him, and maybe this is imagining or wishful thinking, but I don't think so. I could see he was calculating in his head: 'I have to bring America together. I know New York was not for me, the blue state and all that, but I'm going to do this."' Bush said yes.
The administration official remembers that when he heard Bush's answer, "My mouth dropped open." So, apparently, did that of Mitch Daniels, head of the White House Office of Management and Budget, when he found out. Within a few hours of the senators' departure from the Oval Office, the O.M.B. was instructing the leaders of the Republican-controlled House to appropriate much less than $20 billion for New York. That word quickly reached Schumer and Clinton, who again hit the phones.
With Clinton next to him in the Senate cloakroom, Schumer called the White House chief of staff and offered a preview of how they were prepared to brandish the president's promise. "I said to Andrew Card, 'Hillary and I don't want to have to say, on the eve of his going to New York, that the president backed off,"' Schumer recalls.
This was all happening as various Republican and Democratic leaders lurched through a six-hour meeting on Thursday night in House Speaker Dennis Hastert's office to decide what level of emergency spending would be put to a vote in the House. Daschle made the case for New York to get its own $20 billion, separate from the rest of the appropriation, while Senators Don Nickles of Oklahoma and Phil Gramm of Texas, both Republicans, lobbied against it. Hastert, it seemed, was taking his cues from the White House, and at some point after Schumer's conversation with Card, Hastert threw his support behind a $40 billion appropriation, with half to go to the three states in which the hijacked planes had crashed -- New York, Virginia and Pennsylvania -- and the majority of that $20 billion to go to New York.
Schumer and Clinton had been discouraged from participating in the meeting; when they approached the door around 10 p.m., Daschle waved them away, letting them know he was handling the negotiations. He left the room after midnight to call them with the good news. To his shock, he found them slumped in chairs just outside Hastert's office. They had spent much of the intervening two hours hovering near the door and pacing the floor.
But what the House and Senate quickly passed was a general appropriation, not a line-by-line allocation of how the $40 billion would be spent. Several weeks later, when the O.M.B. released its recommendations for divvying the money up, there was only about $8.5 billion to be spent on New York City this year.
The anthrax scare then took hold, and federal lawmakers began worrying about bioterrorism. The air strikes over Afghanistan began, diverting attention from Manhattan to Kabul. New York had competition for the nation's sympathies -- and those sympathies, of course, have always been a little tenuous. In 1995, when Newt Gingrich was the House speaker, he railed against the city's "culture of waste" and claimed -- mistakenly -- that the city absorbed more federal funds than it contributed in taxes. That myth apparently persists. A Democratic aide called me one day with concerns about how I might quote his boss, who represents a rural state. The aide did not want the legislator sounding too reflexively supportive of financial aid for New York, because it might not play so well with suspicious constituents back home.
As time passed, Schumer and Clinton began to encounter a distressing trend -- lawmakers framing the city's plight in terms of areas in their own state hit by natural disasters. Clinton and Schumer reiterated everything that made the World Trade Center attacks different, but some senators seemed to resist the distinctions. Clinton told Lott: "You and I have been to a lot of disasters together. This is beyond anything I've ever imagined." Lott, in response, mused on all the bad weather his state of Mississippi had absorbed.
"We've had everything but locusts," he laughed, "and I expect the locusts will come."
In the middle of all of this, I accompany Clinton one Friday afternoon to New York City. She looks exhausted, and as we walk through La Guardia Airport, she asks if it would be all right to stop for coffee. She is desperate for caffeine. "If they had a place where you could lie down and take it intravenously," she says, "I would." The clerk behind the counter, who cannot stop stealing glances at his famous customer, works on her cappuccino for an awfully long time. "This is the most thorough milk foamer in the world," Clinton whispers.
Then it happens, a brief interchange that hints at her personal stake in her struggles in the capital, at what she has yet to accomplish. A young man spots her, asks the officers in her ever-present Secret Service detail if he can approach her, then walks up to her with a dazzled expression. "I just want to say that your husband is a great man," he tells her. "If he could run for a third term, I'd vote for him again."
"Thank you," she says, "I'll be sure to tell him that." The young man leaves without a compliment or nod of support for her, even though her image has saturated the television airwaves for weeks. Her smile never falters. "Happens all the time," she tells me, and off we go, her gait as brisk and purposeful as ever, to her van, which is waiting at the curb.
Clinton is waging several fights at the same time, one of which is to emerge once and for all from her husband's long shadow. She is trying to move beyond the ethical questions that have long dogged her, and also to prove that for all the talk about carpetbagging and using New York as a steppingstone to national power, she can and will come through for the people of her new home state. The need for the latter was demonstrated by the loud boos from police officers and firefighters when she appeared onstage at Madison Square Garden during a benefit concert for New York in October.
"Oh, you know, I was just happy to be there," she tells me when I ask her about it. "I have gotten used to being in situations in political life, either vicariously or on my own, where that just happens sometimes." She says it was "almost part of the healing process" and that she did not take it personally. "They can blow off steam any way they want to," she shrugs. "They've earned it."
Her husband also took the stage that night and was cheered, but he later scolded one of the event's organizers over her reception, as if the organizer could have controlled it. His attempt to protect her demonstrated what the couple's friends say is a strong if not entirely conventional bond, one that survived all that happened in the White House, a miasma of personal 
scandal that she has clearly not forgotten. (In her van, as we ride from La Guardia into Manhattan, she candidly remarks, "People used to ask me all the time, when Bill was in the White House, 'Gee, it's awfully tough, how can you get up every day?"')
She says that she talks on the phone with her husband all the time, soliciting his advice on all sorts of matters, a mode of conversation that is necessary because they seem to be physically apart more than they are together. He usually stays in Chappaqua or travels when she is in Washington, and when she goes back to New York, as she does almost every weekend, she often heads upstate for political events during the day. There have long been questions about how rooted in Westchester the Clintons are, but friends who have visited them at their Chappaqua house say that it feels very much like the family's shared home, redecorated to a degree that reflects a real emotional investment.
Schumer has been a New Yorker, and his own person, long enough that he has nothing to prove in those regards. But he remains a relatively unknown face on the national scene and a newcomer to the Senate, where he would like a glowing aura of distinction and a career like that of one of his Democratic idols, Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts. He certainly has the legislative creativity and tenacity. "He is unbelievable," one Senate aide says. The aide remembers when Schumer, eager to hurry along one of his projects and tired of waiting to get the "score" from the Joint Committee on Taxation on what it would cost, called the committee's chief of staff himself rather than leaving the matter to his staff. "Other senators are too proud to do that sort of thing," the aide says. "He called her like five times in two days."
Other aides and politicians say Schumer lacks the necessary temperament and generosity, calling him abrasive and needlessly eager to hoard credit and headlines. New York Republicans cited those attributes in explaining why, especially since Sept. 11, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Gov. George Pataki and their staffs have much preferred working with Clinton and her office than with Schumer and his. Bush, by contrast, has a softer spot for Schumer, because he can relate better to Schumer's earthy, extroverted style than to Clinton's cooler reserve.
But a few administration officials are put off by Schumer. One said that when Schumer and Clinton joined Bush on Air Force One for a trip to New York last summer and Bush took the open seat beside Clinton's, Schumer responded by chattering so incessantly that even Bush had a limited chance to speak. When Clinton and Schumer accompanied Bush to ground zero on Sept. 14, Schumer stuck much closer to the president's side, seemingly intent on getting in every television shot. Nick Calio, the administration's chief liaison to Congress, lampooned that tendency in a joke that he later told at a Washington roast. Calio said that when Clinton and Schumer were asking for the $20 billion, she made an additional request that proved impossible to fulfill: a photograph with Bush that did not include Schumer.
Both Clinton and Schumer have not just the obligation of a political lifetime, but also the opportunity of a political lifetime -- to make long strides toward their preferred destinies, to grow in the kind of widespread public regard they want. For her as well as for him, that requires beating back less attractive impulses and habits. She can be gracious and charming, attending bipartisan Congressional prayer meetings with some of the Republicans who most viciously attacked her husband, cracking jokes at her own expense, trying to make nice with the president. When she met with Bush on Sept. 13, she told him that few people could understand the loneliness of the White House, but that she did, and she wanted him to know that.
But she can also be partisan -- going to Daschle earlier this year and recommending a kind of rapid-response war room from which to lob grenades at Republicans and the administration. And she can be prickly. A week after the mid-September Oval Office visit, when Bush delivered his address to Congress, television cameras caught her rolling her eyes. Her aides insisted it had nothing to do with the president, but when I later saw her at a Senate budget committee hearing, she silently and reflexively shook her head and rolled her eyes almost every time one of the economists who were testifying mentioned Bush's tax cut.
Through September and October, as the O.M.B. whittled away at the president's promise, Schumer and Clinton expressed persistent confidence. They arguably had an interest in not publicly doubting Bush's pledge; that might diminish their accomplishment in obtaining it. But they also genuinely believed that the president deserved credit for going out on a limb. And in closed-door meetings with city leaders, they said that they had never firmly expected all of the nearly $20 billion pledged to New York to be delivered right away. They wanted the marker out there as something that they could hold Bush to down the line, something that might increase whatever New York did immediately receive. But they knew that construction in Lower Manhattan could not begin quickly enough to spend the money now. That was the O.M.B.'s argument for delay, and Schumer and Clinton said they at least partly understood it.
They were just as concerned with finding other streams of money, hoping they would ultimately reap much more than $20 billion. Along with other politicians, they succeeded in folding a "victims' compensation fund" into legislation that bailed out airlines. It guaranteed economic restitution to people who were injured or lost family members on Sept. 11 and agreed not to file lawsuits. Much of that money would go to New Yorkers, and the amount might climb toward $10 billion or more.
Then they turned their attention to a $5 billion economic revitalization package of tax cuts and other incentives to try to keep paralyzed businesses in downtown Manhattan from leaving the city. This kind of assistance was not included in the $40 billion in emergency spending, nor was it typical disaster aid. But it was the sort of tonic that Schumer and Clinton thought Manhattan needed instantly, before too many companies left. Trying to get it into a broader stimulus package for the American economy that Senate Democrats were putting together, they sold the $5 billion as something that could be counted against the nearly $20 billion, though they really didn't want that to happen.
"Hillary and I, from the beginning, planned this out," Schumer told the assembled city leaders just before their meetings with Baucus and Lott. "We have to ask for both at the beginning" -- both tax breaks and emergency funds -- and then let both trees grow, hopefully into giant oaks."
"Whole forests," Clinton added.
But getting other New York politicians on the same page proved impossible, because everyone had different stakes and different agendas, which only complicated the already convoluted process of obtaining federal aid. Whatever rivalry existed between Schumer and Clinton paled beside some of the other rivalries at play. With the help of Senator Bob Torricelli, a New Jersey Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, New York's senators got their tax cuts included in a stimulus package that the committee passed. But several House Democrats from New York State, who had failed to get similar measures into a stimulus package approved by the House, were more interested in agitating for the nearly $20 billion in spending, an unresolved matter over which they might still be able to claim some effect. Besides, screaming at the president was good theater, and it fit the more partisan dynamics of the House. At a news conference in early November, Schumer and Clinton wanted to trumpet the tax cuts, and more strident House Democrats like Carolyn Maloney and Gary Ackerman wanted to browbeat Bush. The result: New York's lawmakers ended up shouting over one another. A few left the room in frustration and disgust.
Meanwhile, the new national state of emergency triggered such a rush on federal booty that the Senate stimulus package was initially larded with new subsidies for bison and sugar-beet farmers and money to wipe out citrus canker. Senate Republicans, who were ideologically opposed to the bill's preference for spending over tax cuts, now had an even better excuse to kill it, and they did. As a result, when Senate Democrats began meeting with House Republicans in recent weeks to negotiate a stimulus package palatable to both chambers, they did so without any legislation that had actually passed the Senate, potentially weakening the prospects of the $5 billion in incentives for New York businesses.
Pataki was doing his own thing, too. Worried about his 2002 reelection campaign, he felt the need to release a recovery proposal so comprehensive that no opponent could accuse him of leaving anything out. New York Republicans say he also wanted to make sure there was something for upstate, which was feeling the economic aftershocks of the attacks and which provides Pataki with much of his political support. The result was a wish list that totaled $54billion in desired federal aid and included not just cleanup costs and tax cuts but also a high-speed rail link between Manhattan and upstate cities. Even New York Republicans now admit that it chilled lawmakers from other states, who smelled pork.
Pataki told me it was appropriate to "tell Washington the truth of what we're thinking and not have some stealth agenda -- give us this, and then a month later we're going to ask for that." Besides, he added, "I never intended or expected to be standing on the steps of the Capitol with a giant check for $54 billion." Publicly, Schumer and Clinton took only mild exception to Pataki's approach; privately, their feelings seemed to be stronger, ranging from concern (Clinton) to actual pique (Schumer). The question was not whether Pataki had exaggerated the economic damage to New York City, which a local official estimated to be about $100 billion over two years. It was how to best sidle up to the federal government and wary lawmakers from other states at such a difficult time, with demands from various quarters multiplying and the economy stuck in a slump. Schumer and Clinton struggled with that question, walking in tandem for many weeks after their blowup off the Senate floor, then subtly drifting just a bit apart.
In early November, both senators made peace with House Democrats from New York State by agreeing to push publicly for all of the nearly $20billion in emergency spending, but Schumer worried that New Yorkers were using their best weapon -- the president's guarantee -- before it was necessary or prudent. "We just don't want to be forced to fire our nuclear bomb prematurely," he told me.
Clinton seemed to me less hesitant, more ready to play rough with the administration, an approach with its own risks. "There was lobbying against New York getting this necessary money from the highest places in the administration, which I just for the life of me don't understand," she said on the Senate floor one night shortly after Thanksgiving. "What a shame it would be," she concluded, referring to the nearly $20 billion, "if that promise isn't fulfilled." 
When Schumer spoke on the Senate floor two days later, he was still focusing on the $5 billion in tax cuts, and he never mentioned Bush. They were covering all the angles, but the different roles they assigned themselves perhaps reflected different sensibilities and even an attempt to distinguish themselves from each other. She used fighting words certain to please Democratic activists. He tried to avoid alienating the president, with whom he had a better chance of amity. He told me at one point that he thought Bush could be nudged to the center, and he told others that he wanted to help nudge him there.
The House vote on how to allocate the $40 billion in emergency spending left New York with about $10 billion. Schumer and Clinton hoped to get more from the Senate, and it was possible that once the Senate voted in December and the difference was split, New York would be looking at an amount between $10billion and $12.5 billion. In a sense, Schumer and Clinton had created a monster that came back to bite them: with the promise from the president, they had built up an expectation -- $20 billion for New York alone -- that could not be met. But it was the consensus of many Republicans and Democrats I talked to that beneath that public disappointment remained a private triumph, and that whatever New York received, both now and in the future, would be greater than if its senators had not set the bar so high.
Toward the end of November, just outside the Capitol, various lawmakers from New York gather around a lectern to bemoan their lot. Schumer shows up before Clinton but assures the others: "Hillary is on her way. We'll give her two minutes." Maloney, who arrived 15 minutes early and has been standing at the lectern, ready for her close-up, ever since, starts anyway. When Clinton appears, she is no more than 60 seconds late, if that. Schumer immediately whispers a greeting to her, and she leans in close to him, taking hold of his forearm. When it is his turn to speak, he keeps mentioning her, referring to their joint efforts. When she speaks, she does the same.
They often come across like an old married couple, each always aware of the other's doings; they even finish each other's sentences at times. Fate has hitched them together, no matter what flaws each has come to see in the other or what frustrations they harbor. People who know them well say that she considers him overbearing, and it is true that when they conduct meetings together, he talks more, and he flops around in his chair when she has the microphone. He considers her politically clumsy, and it is true that many Democrats winced when she sullied her campaign victory tour by advocating the abolition of the Electoral College.
They struggle to make the best of it, not just for New York but for themselves. Both could use some softening in their public images; neither would be served by a relationship that degenerates over time into constant public tension, which even some of their supporters believe is a distinct possibility. If they can avoid that, most political observers agree, they have enough combined experiences and assets to accomplish as much as any pair of senators.
"If I were to sit down and choose my home state based on who I thought could represent me the best, there's no question that New York would be in the top two or three," says Luke Albee, the chief of staff for Senator Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat. "They both care, and they work it hard. Part of it is who they are. Part of it is knowing the other one is working. I don't know if they can see the lights of each other's offices, but it's like the first year of law school: nobody leaves the library if nobody else leaves the library."
Therein lies the challenge. When D'Amato -- and then Schumer -- were in the Senate with Moynihan, there was little direct competition. Moynihan was the lofty and aged thinker of big thoughts, which left his partner free to make a louder racket and claim the mantle of the deliverer. Schumer and Clinton both want that mantle. Representative Peter King, a New York Republican, remembers that a while back, when the Senate voted for an appropriation he cared about, Schumer and Clinton called separately to tell him about it within a span of five minutes. "You ask yourself: are they racing to be the first one to tell you or are they both just working hard?" he says. "I'm here eight years and I never got a call from Moynihan." He pauses, then adds, "If the two of them are competing, it's only going to be good for New York."
They indeed seem to jostle for position, in ways that may not be entirely conscious. When I run into Schumer in November, a few days after an American Airlines flight crashed in Queens, he notes that he was in Buffalo at the time and could not get to the city until 4:30 p.m. "Hillary and Joe Allbaugh had just left," he says, an unsolicited detail suggesting his awareness that she had reached the scene before he had, so that she was the one to appear at a televised news conference with Allbaugh, head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. A House Democrat from New York observes, "In poker, I think that's what they call a tell."
Schumer sometimes sprinkles his remarks with allusions to being in the State Assembly during New York's financial crisis in the 1970's and with reminders that he could once see the World Trade Center from the windows of his Brooklyn apartment -- claims of belonging and history that she cannot make. When they sit together for a conference call with New York reporters one afternoon and she cites their regular consultations with Giuliani, Schumer mentions that he just spoke to the mayor at a Yankees game. She would not feel welcome at Yankee Stadium because of the flap during her campaign about her credentials as a self-professed fan of the team, and her face seems to harden a little at Schumer's remark.
Her staff carefully monitors news reports to make sure that she is not being stinted in descriptions of what the two senators are doing. After a reporter for a leading newspaper left her out of an account of the November news conference that turned into a shouting match, one of her aides sent the reporter a chiding e-mail message, asking him why he would "censor the news" to eliminate her role "in this battle for funding." "Imagine you and a colleague spent equal time and effort writing a story," the aide complained, "and your editor ran the story with your colleague's byline and not yours."
At the French restaurant on Capitol Hill, he asks for hot tea, on account of his cold. She tells him some red wine might also do him good.
"You know, it kills germs," she says.
"Then I'll have some," he agrees.
She chooses a bottle of Bordeaux. "Red wine is very good for your heart, No. 1," she says. "It truly is. . . . "
Before she can get to No. 2, he adds, "They say the French have a lower heart-attack rate."
"Absolutely," she says. "Now, Boris Yeltsin had a theory. . . . " 
"That vodka was good for the heart," he jokes, keeping pace with her, maintaining the delicate rhythm they have tried to establish.
"That vodka was good for the heart," she repeats, acknowledging Schumer's contribution, "but that red wine was good to protect submariners from strontium-90. He told me one time at a dinner party -- he said, 'The submariners drink this. Very good. Protects from uranium."' Clinton lowers her voice and clips her words to imitate Yeltsin, which validates the anecdote as a firsthand memory, not a secondhand story. "So if you're ever going near a nuclear reactor," she finishes, "take your red wine, according to Boris."
Schumer politely chuckles. He cannot touch that.

HEADLINE: COMMUNITIES; 
A Grassroots Fight

BYLINE:  By CLAUDIA ROWE 

 BODY:
IT began quietly after Sept. 11, with a few neighbors meeting to talk about their fear of living in the shadow of the Indian Point nuclear power plant. But those conversations spread rapidly and now thousands of people in more than a dozen area towns, villages and school districts have signed petitions and passed resolutions urging the plant's shutdown. 
 At a petition drive in front of the A&P supermarket in Yorktown on Dec. 8, volunteers could hardly keep enough pencils free as they collected signatures from residents who wanted officials to consider converting the plant to natural gas. On Dec. 11, Laura Seitz, a member of the newly formed Citizens Awareness Network in Croton, stood at the train station, handing out fliers for a hearing on Indian Point's evacuation plan, and was stunned by the commuters' response. 
 "All I had to say was 'Indian Point' and people grabbed them," she said. "We ran out of 500 fliers in an hour and 15 minutes. That's very unusual. Usually, when you hand out political stuff a lot of people won't take it."
Less organized are those who support the plant but their presence is becoming apparent. At the A&P petition drive a couple yelled insults from their car and so frightened the volunteers that they called the police. 
To some, simply closing Indian Point seems a misguided goal because even if it were decommissioned, nuclear waste from four decades of operation would remain. Then there are the job figures. Entergy Corporation, which owns the plant, employs about 1,500 people there full time. 
Still, the anti-Indian Point faction appears to be gaining momentum. Each week, new towns and villages join the list of those passing resolutions to decommission the plant or investigate using alternate fuels. 
"I've never seen anything like this in all my years in politics," said Paul J. Feiner, 45, supervisor of the town of Greenburgh, who has been in politics one way or another since he was 13. He held a meeting at his home in October to coordinate disparate community groups. Activity has snowballed so quickly since then -- with chat lines devoted to Indian Point discussions, media inquiries from as far away as Japan, and a rally that was scheduled for this past Thursday -- that Mr. Feiner worries the advocates could burn themselves out. 
"This is just growing by leaps and bounds," he said. "I haven't seen anything like it since the Vietnam War. My e-mail list for Indian Point stuff has 220 names on it and I add new ones every day. The thing that's sort of incredible about this effort is it's so grassroots. People are organizing in their living rooms, they're having meetings in their kitchens." 
Skeptics dismiss these efforts as merely symbolic, pointing out that the town boards of genteel Bedford, tiny Irvington and the other municipalities that have passed resolutions hold no sway over the billion-dollar Entergy operation. Only the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission has the power to close the plant. 
"We know there's a lot of concern among members of the public about this facility, but there are a lot of actions under way to try to improve plant security," said Neil Sheehan, a spokesman for the N.R.C. "We're not going to shut it down unless we've got evidence that it's not being run safely and that has not been demonstrated to us at this point." 
Alex Matthiessen, executive director of Riverkeeper, the environmental group in Garrison, whose resolution opposing the plant provided a model for many of the Westchester municipalities, understands the realities. The strategy, he said, is to create such an enormous groundswell of local sentiment that elected officials will be forced into action. 
"These are political decisions in the end," he said. "There's no doubt that it is an uphill struggle. But when you've got politicians listening to their constituents, you can make a difference."
Larry Gottlieb, northeast communications manager for Entergy, said he was just as confident that the Westchester towns would reverse their decisions once the economic impact of closing the plant becomes clear. 
"There are some people who, God bless 'em, will say, 'Hey, I'd rather live by candlelight,' " Mr. Gottlieb said. "That's fine for them, but what about people with businesses who need the energy Indian Point provides? Even shutting it down doesn't alleviate the risk because the spent fuel still sits there. So it's not just as simple as saying 'Gee, I'm scared and I don't like nuclear power and I don't care what the consequences are.' " 
One county legislator, Michael B. Kaplowitz, said his campaign to win re-election this fall was clearly affected by the concern over Indian Point. Though he had long been unhappy with the plant's operation -- "they run it like someone who never takes their car into a mechanic," he said -- after Sept. 11, his constituents, from soccer moms to small business owners, began telling him they wanted action. 
Working with Westchester County's Department of Public Safety, Mr. Kaplowitz drafted two resolutions calling for increased security at Indian Point and a feasibility study on converting the plant to natural gas. He sent copies to every government entity within 50 miles, asking for support. 
Ms. Seitz, the advocate handing out literature at the train station, said that after 40 years of this kind of work she had no illusions about the years of effort it would take to end nuclear operations at Indian Point. But for the first time in a long while, she feels encouraged. 
"In my lifetime I have seen huge outpourings from ordinary people change the way we look at things," she said. "It's not as if it has never happened before. They've closed plants in other areas. It's going to be tough. Entergy is not going to let a couple of housewives and upset parents throw them. But this is the first time that I feel there actually is a chance to get this done. Everything has changed because of Sept. 11 and the Bush administration is going to have to respond."

HEADLINE: Luxury's Old Guard, Battered by New Realities 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE KAUFMAN

 BODY:
THE Neiman Marcus catalog arrived in mailboxes in November, its famed swagger and over-the-top opulence intact. There was a customized helicopter with entertainment center for $6.7 million, a limited-edition jar of La Mer face cream for $1,200 and a $65 mink-covered coat hanger.
 For customers who visited the stores last week, though, the atmosphere was decidedly less cocky. All of Neiman's house-brand cashmere sweaters were 50 percent off. Giorgio Armani suit jackets were under a "30 percent off" sign. As for evening wear, Bill Blass's exquisite black, beaded floor-length gown, with a vine motif and sheer bodice, was $2,876, down from $4,460. 
 Neiman's is hardly the only place to find discounts on sequins or fur and other relics of the cash-flush 90's. At the height of the December selling season, the venerable Saks Fifth Avenue has as many red markdown signs as its sales-obsessed midpriced cousins like Macy's. 
As the economy has soured, Saks and Neiman, the two icons of department store luxury, have been hit hard. Part of their troubles in this downturn stem from more competition: during the Clinton-era boom more and more stores appeared to cater to the proverbial "ladies who lunch," not to mention dot-com multimillionaires and stock market retirees. As a further blow, it is the department stores' key designers, upon whom they long relied to propel sales, who have been building these dazzling emporiums -- often in the department stores' own backyards. Such palaces of consumption are popping up monthly at the Galleria in Houston, on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, at the Bellagio in Las Vegas or along Madison Avenue in Manhattan.
After the terrorist attacks, the luxury market, which was already slowing, shrank sharply. If it does not come back soon, there may not long be room for both giants of the business. Among the problems that must be solved by Burton Tansky, the chief executive of the Neiman Marcus Group, and R. Brad Martin, his counterpart at Saks Inc., are the rise of a younger, more casual generation, more interested in homes than clothes, and designers determined to present collections on their own terms. 
Perhaps no group of retailers was as greatly affected by Sept. 11 as the sellers of luxury goods. Buying a $13,000 mink or a $500 nylon handbag, always an act of indulgence, suddenly seemed too frivolous for perilous times. Now goods like camel-hair coats and pashmina are stacking up in stores, going begging at 40 percent off.
At Saks recently, the squeeze was all too apparent. A long wool-and-cashmere blend sweater by TSE was $749.90, down from $1,250; a navy Armani evening gown with a low back was $1,379.90, down from $2,300; and a jacket with gold sequins and dyed Finnish fox cuffs and trim was $2,659, down from $3,800.
FOR an industry grown fat, it has been a hard fall. After years of record sales, revenue in recent months at some of the strongest names in the business has dropped as precipitously as the last leg of an amusement-park flume ride. Since the attacks, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton has issued three separate profit warnings, most recently estimating that profits for 2001 would fall 10 to 15 percent from 2000. Gucci has said it expects to meet its earnings estimates for 2001, but it recently let go of 130 people, or 14 percent of its United States work force. Tiffany & Company reported that third-quarter earnings fell 34 percent from the period a year earlier.
On Thursday, Barney's New York announced a third-quarter loss of 61 cents a share, a dizzying decline from the period a year earlier, when it had net income of 24 cents a share.
While the pain has been widespread, the downturn has been particularly perilous for Saks and Neiman Marcus. Late last month, Neiman reported that first-quarter earnings for the group -- which includes 33 Neiman Marcus stores as well as the Bergdorf Goodman division -- would plummet by more than half, to $42 million from $87 million last year. Saks Fifth Avenue, a division of Saks Inc., the former Proffitt's, reported operating losses of $18.9 million for its 64 stores, a steep fall from $30.3 million profit it posted a year earlier.
And their designer rivals keep coming. Today, Louis Vuitton has 37 stores in the United States; five years ago, the total was 26. Giorgio Armani has 24 free-standing stores under its various brands -- not including the more midmarket A/X stores -- double what it had five years ago. Hugo Boss started retail expansion in 1997 and now has 38 American stores, which bring in 40 percent of its sales. Gucci has 27 stores and is aggressively expanding its newly acquired YSL brand. Escada has 16 stores and is adding at least two a year, and Donna Karan, whose company is now part of the LVMH chain, has expressed a desire to build her luxury stores into a worldwide chain.
Not only is there more competition among luxury retailers, but as the lifestyle and aspirations of America's ruling legions become more casual, many top stores are now even doing battle with cleverly stylish downmarket ones. Target, Kohl's and Costco -- all of which seem to be handling the economic downturn just fine -- attract many upper-middle-class dollars with fun, holiday-theme dishes or post-modern tea kettles.
"I think basically both Neiman and Saks are out of sync with the customer," said Walter K. Levy, managing director for retail trends and positioning at Kurt Salmon & Associates. "They are much more formal and fussy; there is not enough casual weekend wear that matches what people will wear on a daily basis." 
The rising tide of wealth in the 1990's was enough to float every yacht, but if the recession continues, investors and bankers say the overall luxury market will shrink.
"Look, there are more people in the middle than in the upper and lower ends," said Peter J. Solomon, chairman of an investment banking firm of the same name, who believes that some consolidation in luxury is inevitable. "There is a risk in dealing with the more narrow band. It is safer in the middle."
If and when one of the great fashion chains becomes obsolete, it may well be able to trace its decline to the designers who opened their own stores. Once, the big stores were the perfect middlemen, guiding the American woman to the proper designer and conferring status on the brands they selected to showcase. Now name brands want to control their own destiny, sometimes even expanding into new product groups. Coach, the bag maker, for example, now makes shoes and furniture.
So why are the designers striking out on their own?
Because both sides have a stake in the relationship, both contend that designers opening their own stores five blocks away from a Neiman's or a Saks can generate traffic for everybody by raising the profile of the brand. Hot merchandise, the theory goes, is hot wherever it is sold.
Still, in conversations with designers' companies, it is easy to get the impression that they think high-end department stores cannot be relied on for the future. "The Armani group has had a strategy in recent years of developing its own store networks," said Robert Triefus, the group's executive vice president for communications. "We are able to present and control our own image."
Presentation is a recurring complaint for designers, who are, after all, in the business of being hyperconscious about image. But it is also a matter of economics.
When designers have their own stores, they are more likely to sell more of their own goods each time a customer walks in, because the shopper can be shown entire ensembles at once. The designer stores also earn more on each article, because they generally discount less and can keep the markup margin that used to go to the retailer.
"The big challenge for luxury department stores is that we are in the era of the consumer," said Marty Staff, president and chief executive of Hugo Boss USA. "In the old days, you'd pick up your suit, walk 30 yards, pick up your ties, go downstairs and look for shoes." Customers, he said, want to see everything together, the way the designers envisioned. At Boss's private stores, an average sale is five products, he said, far more than at department stores. 
He is also concerned about department stores' effectiveness in capturing young customers. "Our core customer is 35 to 54," he said. "But their core male customer is at the high end of the spectrum. They've gone after the 50-year-old customer nicely; the question is, where will the 35-year-old shop in 10 years?"
The designer Zoran, who has built a loyal following with a women's line of simple classic shapes in sumptuous fabrics, is also watching the future with some concern. "Neiman's has the richest clients now, but it has to recognize that America has a different aristocracy," he said. "It is no longer the Rockefellers or the Vanderbilts; it is the Hillary Clintons.
"The privileged one once had money and time; now she doesn't have either," Zoran said. "She comes twice a year only, and you have to be prepared to have the right thing."
If there is a consolation for the luxury chains, it is that the dangers are clearly the long-term type -- unless, contrary to expectations, the recession long and deep.
Of the two giants, Saks is financially weaker. Its merger with the midmarket department store chain Proffitt's in 1998 has provided less cost savings to either side than projected. Moreover, with management distracted by acquisitions, sales at Proffitt's, then at Saks Fifth Avenue, sank, sending the company's stock into a tailspin. The shares now trade at around $9, compared with a 2001 high of $14.23 in February and far from their five-year high of $44.08, just before the merger.
MOST analysts say Saks's position is far from desperate, though Moody's Investor's Service put its bonds, already rated in the high-risk, or junk, category, on review in October for further downgrade. Elaine Francolino, Moody's debt analyst, pointed to a new $700 million secured bank loan the company received in November. "The company has consistently made progress on reducing debt and is managing cash flow well," she said.
Mr. Martin, meanwhile, says he is moving aggressively to position Saks for the evolving marketplace. At 50, he has something to prove. As chief of Proffitt's before the Saks acquisition, he made his reputation as an acquirer king, snapping up midpriced department stores in the South and streamlining their costs to the delight of Wall Street. Now he is determined to fix Saks Fifth Avenue.
Two months ago, the store opened its first home-furnishings boutique in the Manhattan flagship; it is intended as a prototype to be expanded to the chain. The company has been introducing younger casual apparel, along with a pointed marketing campaign it says has lowered the average age of customers by two to three years. 
Neiman's, which is coming off record sales in 2000 and is more conservatively financed than Saks, is stable, but it is not without its own concerns. The Neiman Marcus Stores division lost H. W. Mullins as chief executive and chairman in November last year. Mr. Tansky, the president and chief executive of the parent company, the Neiman Marcus Group, took over for him on an interim basis. But Mr. Tansky still has those extra duties, because the company has been unable to attract the talent it wants, several executive recruiters said.
MR. Tansky is not exactly an unknown quantity. He ran Neiman's stores division before Mr. Mullins did, and they helped negotiate partial-ownership deals with high-growth brands like Kate Spade, the handbag maker, and Laura Mercier cosmetics. Still, Mr. Tansky, 63, had said when he appointed Mr. Mullins that he did not have time to run the stores and be an executive at the larger corporate group. It is doubtful that the downturn has made his schedule any easier. Neiman's acknowledges that the situation is not ideal. "We are continuing to look at our executive structure," said Jim Skinner, the group's chief financial officer.
Moreover, Neiman's has focused so intently on high couture -- rarefied fashion accounts for 60 percent of its sales -- that it may have painted itself into a corner. If current trends continue, as the next generation comes of age it will prefer to spend less money on formal clothes and more on casual clothes and fancy home decorating. Mr. Skinner seemed relatively unconcerned with the trends and suggested that the increasing focus on the home and casual styles are cycles that might already be nearing their end. Besides, he added, "every generation has a fashion-focused component."
Whatever obstacles they face, the chains have one thing in common: confidence in their future and an unwavering faith in the luxury market. "I have a very strong belief there is a rising tide of affluence in America and globally long term," said Mr. Martin, 50, the chief executive and chairman of Saks Inc. "The economy does not work in a linear fashion, but in the long run, luxury is where we want to be."
Dana Telsey, a luxury goods analyst at Bear Stearns, agreed. "This is not a market that is over-stored; it is under-stored," she said. "The rich are getting richer, and the wealth among high-net-worth individuals is going to grow at 8 percent annually over the next five years," on average, she estimated. 
Still, Ms. Telsey expects plenty of expansion among companies she covers, including Coach, Gucci and Tiffany's, which means plenty more competition for Neiman and Saks. "Coach only has 120 stores," she said. "There is room for 250." If she is correct, the pressure on the grand old carriage-trade department stores will be enormous.

PERSON: Joseph M. Tucci 

HEADLINE: Private Sector; 
He Knows This Bumpy Hill Well

BYLINE:  By BARNABY J. FEDER 

 BODY:
JOSEPH M. TUCCI calls himself a car nut. He says the used sports cars he acquires -- a Porsche twin turbo is his current prize -- are treated so lovingly that he can sell them at a profit. 
 No wonder Mr. Tucci, the chief executive of EMC, sometimes slips into car-and-driver analogies when discussing the company's remarkable rise to leadership in the data storage industry, its current problems or its plans for regaining momentum. But Mr. Tucci, 54, said those slips made him impatient with himself. 
 "I hate car analogies," he said, abruptly halting one in a recent interview. They tend to lead to oversimplification, he explained. 
Fair enough, but a snapshot of Mr. Tucci's career might read like this: Energetic, ambitious young executive proves adept at keeping Sperry and Unisys computers from being blown off the technology racetrack by I.B.M. More mature executive pulls the onetime office automation leader Wang out of the bankruptcy ditch, soups it up with new products and gets it running smoothly enough to sell to a European competitor. Seasoned manager is rewarded with the driver's seat in the front-running car on the data storage circuit. Ready to finally experience the thrill of putting the pedal to the metal with everyone else in the rear-view mirror, he has barely tightened his seat belt when . . . kaboom! 
This is going to require more than a minor pit stop.
Mr. Tucci has had the misfortune of starting his job at one of the worst possible times -- at least when it comes to problems beyond his control. Since his promotion almost a year ago, the country has fallen into recession, and companies have cut technology spending. The cuts have been especially deep for big-ticket products like the multimillion-dollar storage systems built around EMC's flagship, Symmetrix, a refrigerator-size box full of memory disks.
EMC, which finished 2000 with a burst that lifted its sales to $8.9 billion, aimed to hit $12 billion this year. Analysts now expect sales to slump to about $6.8 billion this year and to decline as much as $1 billion more in 2002.
EMC was also blindsided by a price war initiated by Hitachi Data Systems, a unit of Hitachi Ltd., the deep-pocketed Japanese company, and joined by I.B.M.'s data storage division. 
Fighting back in a shrinking market destroyed EMC's profits. After earning $1.8 billion last year, EMC, based in Hopkinton, Mass., is expected to lose at least $600 million this year. The loss will reflect about $675 million in restructuring charges that included provisions to cut 4,000 additional jobs, bringing the total to 5,500, or 23 percent of the work force.
Critics say EMC has problems in addition to uncontrollable market forces. They say that its technology advantages have eroded and that years of aggressive behavior by EMC sales representatives have soured relations with many customers.
Fortunately for EMC, Mr. Tucci may be even better suited to managing upheaval than the prosperity that the company projected when he joined it nearly two years ago. "He has made a career out of stewarding transitions," said James Berlino, an analyst at Merrill Lynch who has known Mr. Tucci since his days at Unisys. "He's a hands-on guy who is incredibly direct."
Mr. Tucci is already credited with pushing a sales force reorganization on the company that helped it overtake Network Appliance, the early market leader in the fast-growing new segment of smaller storage devices attached to networks instead of mainframe computers. He used a friendship from his days at Wang with Kevin Rollins, president and chief operating officer at Dell Computer, to clear the way for a recently announced alliance in which Dell will market EMC's smaller systems. 
"He seems to know someone everywhere in high tech and in all of the Fortune 1,000," said Frank Hauck, an EMC executive vice president. Not that Mr. Tucci is all business: in his office are photographs of him with Pope John Paul II and, reflecting the transition in athletic passions from sandlot baseball and skiing to golf, Jack Nicklaus. 
Mr. Tucci is more of a gregarious team builder than his predecessor, Michael C. Ruettgers, who did much managing through one-on-one discussions. Some who have sat through the everyone-gets-to-speak meetings favored by Mr. Tucci fret that important decisions might be slowed, but the benefits have been clear. 
"Everyone feels like they are a part of the process," Mr. Hauck said.
That includes Mr. Ruettgers, who assumed the title of executive chairman when Mr. Tucci became chief executive. The continuing active presence of Mr. Ruettgers raised questions on Wall Street about who was running EMC. One of the most successful chief executives of his era -- his nine years spanned virtually all of the 1990's, when EMC was the fastest-growing stock on the New York Stock Exchange -- Mr. Ruettgers meets regularly with major customers and speaks for the company at public events.
"There were a lot of people wondering what was going on," said H. Clinton Vaughan, who follows EMC for Salomon Smith Barney. 
It is a delicate relationship, but it works, those involved say. "He's the boss," said Mr. Ruettgers, who turned 59 last week. The two consult on all strategic issues and almost always reach similar conclusions, though by such different routes that they kid each other about it, Mr. Ruettgers said.
"Employees are more comfortable approaching him," said Mr. Ruettgers, adding with a chuckle that there was no overcoming ancestry. "I'm German and he's Italian."
Mr. Tucci's clearest assertion of control occurred two weeks ago, when he announced a reorganization dividing the company into three groups and reducing the role of Moshe Yanai, the longtime champion within the company of Symmetrix. The new organization emphasized Mr. Tucci's strategy of reducing EMC's reliance on hardware sales and software designed specifically for EMC products. The first major product in support of the open systems strategy, a software suite called AutoIS that runs storage hardware from many companies, will roll out next year.
MR. TUCCI, who was born in the Bronx and spent his early childhood in Brooklyn, entered the computer business with RCA after graduating from Manhattan College. His youthful conviction that he would someday run a major company got a boost when Sperry, his next destination after RCA, financed his studies for an M.B.A. from Columbia University. 
His success in rebuilding Wang caught the eye of Richard Egan, then EMC's chairman, who approached him about joining EMC's board shortly before Getronics, a Dutch company, bought Wang. When it became clear to Mr. Egan and Mr. Ruettgers that Mr. Tucci would soon be a free agent, they switched their pitch to another position they were trying to fill: president, chief operating officer and heir apparent to Mr. Ruettgers.
Although some of EMC's headiest growth was ahead of it, Mr. Tucci took the job expecting major challenges, said Joseph Kroger, his former boss at Sperry and a longtime mentor. "He knew the stock price was too high when he went," Mr. Kroger said. 
Mr. Tucci's challenge now is to prove that this is no longer true. The stock closed Friday at $15.04, down nearly 85 percent percent from its peak of $102.64 in September 2000 and about 70 percent from where it stood the day he joined the company.

HEADLINE: Visions of a Brand-Name Office Empire 

BYLINE:  By DAVID BARBOZA 

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
SAM ZELL is not a man plagued by self-doubt. He never has been. The only son of an uncompromising immigrant who did not brook dissent once he fled Poland just hours before the Nazis invaded, Mr. Zell grew up driven, ambitious and as certain of his own judgment as his father was of his.
 One of the world's richest men, Mr. Zell controls public companies that own nearly 700 office buildings in the United States with 125 million square feet of space, as well as 225,000 residential units. No one -- not Donald J. Trump, not Mortimer B. Zuckerman, not Leona Helmsley -- has that much office space. Mr. Zell is so confident that, even as the real estate market weakens and as Wall Street analysts question his deals, he says he is writing a new chapter in real estate history. 
 Mr. Zell, a flamboyant 60-year-old with a penchant for riding to work on a Ducati motorcycle, has spent $27 billion during the last four years in a series of blockbuster acquisitions that created two huge REIT's, or real estate investment trusts. 
Now, Mr. Zell says, he will transform the real estate market by turning those REIT's, particularly Equity Office Properties Trust, into national brands recognized by big corporations. By offering convenience and consistent quality to big companies with many offices, Mr. Zell believes, they will start to view those offices as something more than a commodity chosen chiefly by price and location.
Developers like Mr. Trump and the late Harry Helmsley have used branding -- essential for things like cars and hotels -- in local real estate markets, but with spotty success. Mr. Zell is trying to take the idea nationwide, with the help of new ancillary services like high-speed Internet connections.
But Wall Street analysts and real estate experts say that Mr. Zell overpaid for some of the office properties and that his real estate empire will be hard-pressed to deliver profit growth. Branding, they say, is a sideshow to the real issue -- whether he can justify his enormous investment.
Shares of Equity Office have staggered since the company acquired Beacon Properties for $4 billion in 1997, Cornerstone Properties of New York for $4.6 billion in 2000 and Speiker Properties of California for $7.2 billion in February. On Friday, they closed at $29.33, near their level in late 1997, despite years of solid profits. Worse, the real estate market is heading for a downturn, experts say, leading some to contend that Mr. Zell has yet to demonstrate the advantage of his bigger-is-better strategy.
"Sam is now the dominant landlord in Boston, San Francisco and Seattle," said Fred Carr, a principal at the Penobscot Group in Cambridge, Mass., which tracks REIT's. "But it remains to be seen what the real advantage is in that."
Mr. Zell, who controls a $25 billion corporate empire from his office in the old Daily News Building here, overlooking the Chicago River, has had his share of failures. American Classic Voyages, a cruise line in which he had a 50 percent stake, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in October after the drop-off in tourism from the terrorist attacks. And shares of Chart House Restaurants, a restaurant chain of which he took control in 1997, have plummeted to penny-stock status.
BUT, used to playing the odds, he has often fared well. In the 1970's, he made millions buying distressed real estate, fixing it up and collecting the profits. After writing an essay about his ability to acquire good properties that most considered dead, he was tagged "the grave dancer." He then moved on to other things, investing in businesses from radio stations to fertilizer companies to rail cars.
Among his big holdings, usually acquired with the backing of major banks, were the Revco drug store chain and Sealy, the mattress company. Both were re-engineered and yielded big gains. Mr. Zell bought Revco for about $7 a share in 1992, for example, and sold it to CVS for $40 a share five years later.
These days, Mr. Zell says he is again "testing the limits" of his entrepreneurial skills. "There's no one in the world who has ownership on this scale, and no one is trying to run it as a network," Mr. Zell said in an interview. 
Consolidation means cheaper access to capital, he contends, as well as lower insurance premiums and the ability to attract national customers. Equity Office is already pulling in about $20 million a year from ancillary services, Mr. Zell says, and that number should grow substantially because 75 customers account for about 20 percent of the company's square feet of space. 
MR. ZELL, who speaks in raspy tones, occasionally sprinkled with obscenities, has a derring-do quality about him. His sentences jab, then punch. Outlining his latest vision, he talks about cheaper supply contracts and selling national advertising spots that can be shown on all Equity Office elevator monitors and in parking lots. "There will be a concierge, selling telecommunications," Mr. Zell said. "We'll create preferred services; we'll have software off the Web. We want to put the landlord where he ought to be -- as the intermediary for delivering a number of services."
The intent, he said, is to transform a leasing company into a full-fledged service provider.
The problem is, so few people want to buy those services. Companies are trying to cut costs. No other REIT is trying national branding, and those that have tried adding similar services have noticed little effect. Analysts dismiss these plans as small improvements on the margins, not big enough to reshape the economics of a huge company.
"Lots of local businesses have become national companies -- local food brands, newspapers, television, the media, said David Shulman a real estate analyst at Lehman Brothers. "So there is precedent everywhere else in the economy."
"The question is: How amenable is real estate?" he added. "The economies of scale are getting better deals on executives, insurance and finance. After that, it's hard to find economies."
Though Mr. Zell has earned praise for selecting good management teams for his buildings, operating as a corporate giant out of regional offices may be problematic, analysts say. "Accepted wisdom in the industry is you want a local sharpshooter," said Mr. Carr of Penobscot. "The presumption is the local sharpshooter knows more. Sam has done a remarkable job even though he's not a local sharpshooter, but it's still a hurdle."
Twice in his career, Mr. Zell has been dragged into investigations of possible tax evasion by the Internal Revenue Service. In 1976, he was indicted for conspiracy to avoid paying taxes in a real estate deal. The charges were dismissed after he agreed to cooperate and testify against his brother-in-law, Roger Baskes, who was sentenced by a federal judge to two years in prison. In a more recent case in tax court, the I.R.S. is seeking up to $83 million from Mr. Zell's former business partner, concerning a tax reduction scheme involving Mr. Zell, who was not accused. The case is pending.
But even critics tend to praise him as an eccentric who can zero in on problems and opportunities, even if they disagree with his strategy.
"What he's extraordinary at, compared to almost anyone else I've ever met -- and I've dealt with Nobel Prize winners and key executives -- is his ability to advance the thought process," says Peter D. Linneman, a professor of real estate at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and a former assistant to Mr. Zell. "He's good at quickly grasping the key issues and saying, 'I'd think about this, this and this.' "
This is Sam Zell the seer, who believes he can anticipate boom-and-bust cycles. In 1988, he wrote an article entitled "From Cassandra, With Love," predicting a commercial real estate bust, which came in 1990. In 1999, during the dot-com boom, he was among those who repeatedly warned that the bubble would not last and mostly stayed clear of technology investments.
His message now is that the American real estate market is remarkably healthy, that the overinvestment and excess borrowing, the overbuilding and huge credit shortage of the 1980's and early 1990's are gone.
True, the real estate market is softening, with a growing office vacancy rate, but structural changes -- including the tremendous growth of publicly traded real estate investment trusts like his own -- have created a more stable and rational marketplace, he contends.
Renewed corporate efficiency and better information among investors and developers has tempered the tendency toward excessive lending and overbuilding, he says. Nor does he believe that Sept. 11 terrorist attacks will have a lasting effect on the office building market.
Industry experts tend to agree that overbuilding may not be a problem. Vacancy rates are not expected to approach 20 percent, as they did a decade ago. "Veterans call the early 90's a real estate depression," said John Lutzius, a real estate analyst at Green Street Advisors. "We've had a rapid decline in the health of the national office market, but it doesn't look as bad from an operating view; they're going into this downturn with much less leverage."
This is all good for Mr. Zell, who is betting a large part of his estimated $2 billion personal fortune on the future of American real estate. In addition to owning about 6 percent of Equity Office Properties, his empire includes 3 percent of Equity Residential Properties Trust, another REIT, as well as the Equity International Properties, a private company invested in Latin American properties and hotels, and 10 percent of Manufactured Home Communities, a public company that operates mobile home parks in the United States.
Once the chief executive of many of the companies he invested in, Mr. Zell is now chairman -- that is, strategic adviser, elder statesman, real estate guru and chief deal maker. He has a staff of about 60 to help manage his holdings, and each company has its own chief executive. Often, the companies do business with one another and with Mr. Zell's private companies -- something he defends.
Allied Riser, for example, a provider of data, video and voice communications services that has lost $375 million so far this year, rents space from Equity Office and signed a contract to install fiber optic equipment in 350 of the REIT's buildings. And Allied Riser bought $8 million worth of equipment from Anixter, a computer cable manufacturer in which Mr. Zell has a large stake. He says there are no conflicts.
Mr. Zell assumed the chairman's mantle gradually after his financial empire was rocked in 1990 by a collapsing real estate market and the death of Robert H. Lurie, a friend and longtime business partner. That forced him to reorganize his operations. After Mr. Lurie's death, he said: "I didn't want to have extensive operations. By creating these public companies, each company has its own management team and balance sheet. I can be a strategic adviser, but I'm not in the day-to-day operations."
Friends and relatives say Robert Lurie's death at 48 had a devastating effect on Mr. Zell. The two were ideal partners. Mr. Lurie, who had studied engineering at college, was the math whiz who crunched the numbers; Mr. Zell was the visionary salesman. "I was the rainmaker and he ran the store," Mr. Zell said.
Mr. Zell, whose father sold everything from flour to jewelry to property, has always had an instinct for sales. At 12, he bought copies of Playboy magazine under the elevated train tracks in Chicago for 50 cents each and then peddled them in the suburbs for $1.50.
By the time he graduated from Highland Park High School in 1959, he showed some of the intransigence he shared with his father. The caption beneath his yearbook picture reads: "I am not arguing with you, I am telling you."
At the University of Michigan, where he was a political science major, Mr. Zell talked his way into managing some off-campus housing property. He made enough money to start a small real estate company with Mr. Lurie, a fraternity brother. It was the beginning of their real estate empire.
Mr. Zell continued to manage and own properties as he attended law school at Michigan. After graduating in 1966, he briefly worked at a small Chicago law firm, then returned to real estate. He and Mr. Lurie bought apartment buildings in small but fast-growing cities, from Orlando, Fla., to Reno, Nev., and used favorable tax laws to attract wealthy investors to his real estate deals.
When the real estate market collapsed in 1974, he swooped in to buy properties from other REIT's that were selling property cheap.
Early on, he said, he was "a student of inefficient markets," which took him from existing real estate to development to distressed corporations. Some, like Schwinn, a bicycle maker, taught him a painful lesson -- it failed in July. Others, like Anixter, have outperformed the market.
THE last recession, in the early 1990's, was as close as his empire ever came to a breaking point. But when the real estate market recovered, Mr. Zell began taking his companies public, selling shares in Equity Office and Equity Residential as real estate investment trusts, which are required by law to return 90 percent of their profits to investors. The two companies have outperformed the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the REIT industry over the last three years, during which they returned about $3.5 billion to investors by way of dividends, earning a total return of about 14 percent a year. 
Industry experts say the inclusion of Mr. Zell's second REIT, Equity Residential, in the S.& P. 500 a few weeks ago brought real estate investment trusts further into the mainstream of investing.
Despite his recent setbacks, his zest is undiminished. He enjoys motorcycle trips with his friends, who call themselves Zell's Angels. At a party last month -- postponed from September because of the terrorist attacks -- he sailed 600 guests up the Chicago River to a renovated warehouse. There he treated them to a concert by Bette Midler and a spectacular fireworks display. As usual, Mr. Zell was not thinking small.

HEADLINE: The Nation; 
Government Fiddles And the Economy Burns

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
IN the real world, as this recently fat and happy nation has learned once again, the economy can change with distressing speed. Hundreds of thousands of jobs disappear in a month. Confidence -- and stock market gains -- evaporate in a blink. Companies whose strategies appeared brilliant are exposed as overreaching, or even fraudulent, the moment times get tough.
 In the political economy, however, nothing ever seems to change. Republicans insist that, whatever the question, the answer is tax cuts. Democrats demand help for the little guy, often invoking class warfare in the process. Lobbyists tailor their pleadings to the climate of the day, and members of both parties sidestep principle to help or protect favored interests back home. 
 Such predictable clashes of ideology, combined with the pursuit of parochial interests, all but ensure that political leaders in Washington will respond in slow motion -- if they respond at all -- to the fast-forward blur of a deteriorating economy.
So it was that Congress and the Bush administration were still haggling over an economic recovery package last week, even as the Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the 11th time this year and some private economists began seeing signs, albeit tentative ones, that the recession may be entering its final stages.
But though they may run at different speeds, politics and the economy are inextricably intertwined. And as they confront this downturn, however haltingly, Democrats and Republicans are facing the likelihood that the hopeful possibilities glimpsed in recent years -- of paying off the national debt, shoring up Social Security, helping the elderly bear the rising costs of prescription medicines -- may have vanished.
Whether this recession fundamentally alters the politics of the economy depends to some extent on how long it persists. An outbreak of Japanese-style deflation in the United States, or a long and costly war on terrorism, would change the terms of the debate. But even if the future proves less dire, the changed situation already holds implications for everything from the 2002 elections to the ability of the nation to get its finances in order for the aging of the baby-boom generation.
Assuming that they complete a deal on a stimulus bill that includes tax cuts and additional benefits for the unemployed -- by no means a certainty -- Congress and the White House could have a substantial effect on the strength if not the timing of the recovery. While many analysts expect the downturn to end by spring, there is considerable debate among economists about how robust the rebound will be, with some forecasters projecting tepid growth and others seeing a boomlet.
In political terms, both parties are positioning themselves for an election-year battle in 2002. They have rediscovered their inner Keynesians, eagerly seeking new spending (Democrats) or tax cuts (Republicans), while arguing over who lost the surplus. Democrats blame President Bush and his big tax cut. Republicans blame an economic slowdown that started when Bill Clinton was still in the White House, and big-spending Democrats in the Senate. 
Either way, the agendas of both parties will be severely constrained in coming years by the lack of money on the table. More broadly, the combination of recession and war is forcing both parties to rethink the relationship between budget policy and the economy. 
The Social Security lockbox, the centerpiece of that relationship for the past few years, was shorthand for a commitment that the bulk of the projected surplus, the portion coming from the retirement system, go only to reducing the national debt. 
It had an economic rationale: that reducing the debt would give the nation more financial flexibility a few decades from now when the aged baby boomers place a huge strain on the social welfare system, and in the meantime would help bring down long-term interest rates, spurring more growth-enhancing investment by businesses and consumers alike. 
But debt reduction was always as much a political concept as an economic one, adopted by the two parties as a way of keeping each other from getting their hands on what seemed at the time to be limitless surpluses. 
It also proved to have great appeal to voters, who seemed to feel virtuous that the government was paying for its profligate past even as they were running up record levels of consumer debt and driving down their own savings rates to near zero.
The popularity of debt reduction also muffled the traditional ideological arguments about how best to encourage long-term economic growth, which in any case didn't seem to be much of a problem. 
WITH unemployment at record lows, Democrats had a hard time making the argument that more government spending on education, health care and transportation would yield a payoff in the form of a more productive work force and a more efficient economy. And until Mr. Bush's election, when the projected surplus was so big that the biggest tax cut in a generation could be portrayed as fiscally responsible, Republicans had little success selling their idea that cutting taxes would generate more investment and create more jobs. They were able to sell Mr. Bush's tax cut only by promising that there was still plenty of money for debt reduction -- an assertion that now is likely to be proved false.
Robert B. Reich, a liberal Democrat who was labor secretary in the Clinton administration and is now considering running for governor of Massachusetts, said the current fiscal troubles and the disappearance of the lockbox are an opportunity to re-engage a vigorous debate between the left and right on economic policy.
"The right would say you need tax cuts to generate incentives for the wealthy and companies," he said. "The left of center would say, what about public investment? If you don't have good education and healthy people and a good transportation system, you can forget about productivity improvements in the future. The chances of having that debate now are higher than when we were locked into the silly debate over the Social Security lockbox."
Those arguments, from both left and right, will still have to compete with the case for debt reduction. Paying off the debt resonated with voters not only because it was easy virtue, but because this is a nation of homeowners and credit card holders who are well aware of how rising interest rates bite into their wallets.
Of course, the whole notion of debt reduction hinges on the existence of surpluses, and there are credible studies circulating on Capitol Hill that show nothing but deficits for the next decade. Having sold the nation on fiscal responsibility, politicians could now have a difficult time explaining why it is no longer possible -- and how the opportunities it yielded got away from us.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: INTELLIGENCE; 
New Clue Fails to Explain Iraq Role in Sept. 11 Attack

BYLINE:  By CHRIS HEDGES with DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. 

 BODY:
When Czech officials disclosed that Mohamed Atta, the suspected mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks, had met last April with an Iraqi diplomat in Prague, it stirred immediate speculation about whether Iraq had a role in killing thousands of Americans.
 But in the weeks since, the Prague meeting has emerged as an object lesson in the limits of intelligence reports rather than the cornerstone of the case against Iraq. Interviews with Iraqi defectors, Czech officials, and people who knew the Iraqi diplomat have only deepened the mystery surrounding Mr. Atta's travels through central Europe. 
 Iraqi opposition groups say the episode cannot have been a coincidence. According to several former Iraqi intelligence officials, the diplomat was actually a well trained spy with ties to terrorist operations, a master of disguise whose movements are supervised by Iraq's most senior officials. 
American officials in Washington, by contrast, said the diplomat was a minor functionary who happens to have the same last name as a more important Iraqi intelligence agent. These officials said that they had no evidence that Iraq was involved in the attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon.
There are even questions about whether the reports of the meeting took place. An associate said the Iraqi diplomat had a business selling cars and met frequently with a used car dealer from Germany who bore a striking resemblance to Mr. Atta. Just this week, there were even reports from Prague that the Mohamed Atta who visited Prague last April was a different man with the same name. 
In a retreat from the earlier definitive statements by his government, the president of the Czech Republic, Vaclav Havel, recently said there was "a 70 percent" chance the meeting between Mr. Atta and an Iraqi agent named Ahmed Khalil Ibrahim Samir al-Ani took place.
With the Taliban vanquished and Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda fighters cornered in Afghanistan, this sort of arcane debate among experts has taken on new significance. President Bush has said he intends to defeat the nations and groups that support terrorism, a global war whose targets will be selected by intelligence agencies sifting through fragmentary conflicting evidence comparable to the reports about the Prague meeting.
"There was definitely one meeting," between Mr. Ani and Mr. Atta, an intelligence official in Washington said. "We don't know if it was significant. We certainly don't attribute to it the significance others attribute to it automatically. Just because there was a meeting doesn't mean it was connected to 9/11."
This much has been asserted. Mr. Atta went to Prague last April and then flew to Florida as the plot to ram jetliners into buildings gained momentum. It has been reported by Czech authorities that he met with Mr. Ani, the diplomat who Iraqi opposition leaders insist is an important spymaster for Saddam Hussein.
American intelligence officials who believe that Mr. Ani is a low-ranking diplomat of little consequence emphasize that the Iraqi National Congress, the opposition group seeking to overthrow Saddam Hussein, has an agenda and a history of coloring fact to suit its needs.
As if the waters were not muddied enough, some in Prague who knew the diplomat say he met with a used car salesman named Saleh from Nuremberg, Germany, who looked like Mr. Atta. "He is a perfect double for Atta," said a Syrian businessman who has lived in Prague for 35 years and says he knew the diplomat and the car salesman. "I saw him several times with Mister Consul." 
On Friday, a major Czech newspaper, quoting Czech intelligence officials, offered still another theory: the Mohamed Atta who came to Prague last April was not the hijacker but a Pakistani of the same name.
"He didn't have the same identity card number," an unidentified Interior Ministry official told the newspaper Mlada Fronta Dnes. "There was a great difference in their ages, their nationalities didn't match, basically nothing -- it was someone else." The details of the meeting, as reported by the Czech authorities, remain vague. The Czech intelligence service has not said how it knows the meeting took place, or what was said.
"We went to the public just with the thing we can really prove," said Hynek Kmonicek, the Czech ambassador to the United Nations who gave Mr. Ani his expulsion orders last April. "And we can really prove just one thing: that these two people met." But his proof, he acknowledged, is the Czech Interior Ministry announcement. 
Mr. Ani was expelled from Prague for activities that were described as "incompatible with his diplomatic status." Details of his infraction have never been made public but they had nothing to do with Mr. Atta, who was unknown to Czech intelligence, Mr. Kmonicek said.
A number of Arabs in Prague who knew Mr. Ani say he had every attribute of a minor figure in a minor post, a woman chaser and drinker with a tyrannical penchant whose main task seemed to be urging Iraqis to return home. Yet former Iraqi intelligence agents in exile in Europe, made available for interviews by the Iraqi National Congress, say they grew up with and worked with Mr. Ani and that he is an established and respected spymaster.
His specialty is said to be the recruitment of foreign Muslim militants who support Iraq's long campaign against America and the close surveillance and intimidation of Iraqi dissidents.
The former Iraqi agents in Europe say that Mr. Ani, is in fact, Muhammad Kailil Ibrahim al-Ani.
"Baghdad would only use Ani for big jobs, serious jobs," said a former major in Iraqi intelligence. "He had something very important to tell Atta, or Atta had something very important to tell Baghdad."
Mr. Ani, for his part, adamantly denied any ties to terrorism or Sept. 11 and said he had never heard of Mr. Atta until after the terror attack. Jaroslev Kmenta, a Czech journalist who knew Mr. Ani in Prague, interviewed him in Baghdad last month.
' "I've never in my life met him, never seen him, never spoke to him," Mr. Kmenta quoted him as saying. "The first time I heard of him was after Sept. 11." 
Mr. Kmenta said Mr. Ani seemed to be living well in Baghdad, driving a late-model BMW and eating at a riverside restaurant, which would support the thesis that he is a figure of importance to the regime because economic sanctions have left most Iraqi civil servants living in penury. 
The defectors in Europe said that like many agents sent abroad, Mr. Ani altered his real name from post to post, dropping his first name, Muhammad, in Prague and going by Ahmed.
"I went down to renew my driver's license in 1991 in Baghdad," said the former major in the intelligence service, who fled to Europe after his brother was executed for involvement in a failed coup in 1994 against Mr. Hussein. "I saw Ani dressed in jeans, with an earring and with long flowing hair. He looked like a hippie. He was on a job. I could not speak with him. I saw him a year later dressed in long Arab robes."
He said Mr. Ani grew up in a middle class neighborhood in Baghdad and joined the intelligence service, following a year or two of university studies. He was sent to study at The Institute of National Security, the preparatory school for Iraq's intelligence service. In 1994, the defectors said, he was transferred to a new intelligence branch created for foreign operations called Al-Amin al-Khas. He soon was part of special operations, a unit for covert activities like recruitment and assassination.
In Prague, few who were interviewed about Mr. Ani thought of him in such vaunted terms. But they recognized allegations of highhandedness. Waled Majed Bahnam, 56, and his son Majid Waled Majed, 22, both Iraqis, own the Bavodo restaurant in Prague. In July 2000 for the Iraqi national day, Mr. Ani ordered $1,200 worth of food and catering from the restaurant.
After three days, when the bill still had not been paid, the mother called asking for the money. The family said Mr. Ani and the accountant came over and screamed at them. "They said 'We are the embassy, you are nothing, we are the boss, you are animals,' " Mr. Bahnam said. Mr. Ani threatened to revoke their passports and the accountant said he would kill the couple's eldest son. When the family complained to the Foreign Ministry, the embassy paid the bill.

HEADLINE: O Brave New Bavaria! So Much More Than Beer 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: MUNICH 

 BODY:
Germany's huge economy has slipped into recession like a tanker slowly sinking, but here in Bavaria life continues to be rich, profitable, hoppy and sweet.
 From its famous beer to its famous BMW's, from lederhosen to laptops, the Bavarian economic miracle continues apace, both annoying and attracting the rest of Germany. Of the 16 German states, Bavaria consistently ranks first or second in growth rate and living standards and among the lowest in unemployment. 
 Bavarians do not care how they are perceived. They see themselves as Texans in lederhosen -- more ambitious, more brave, more willing to take risks than the stiff Prussians in Berlin. With a united Germany now at the center of a united Europe, the center of that larger Europe, in their view, is here, not in the old coastal trading centers like Hamburg. 
Italy, Switzerland, Austria, Poland and the Czech Republic are steps away, and pro-business Bavaria has plans. Its state president, Edmund Stoiber, 60, a law-and-order conservative, is the favorite to run against the current German chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, in next fall's elections. Given Germany's rising unemployment and crime, Mr. Stoiber would have a chance to win.
Though Mr. Schroder is more popular than his Social Democratic Party, it is running only a few points ahead of the Christian Democratic Union and its sister party, Mr. Stoiber's Bavaria-based Christian Socialist Union, and that is while those parties are in the midst of a leadership battle.
Angela Merkel, the easterner who is chairwoman of the Christian Democrats, fares badly against Mr. Schroder in polls, but she is resisting Mr. Stoiber's not-so-quiet push to lead the Christian parties into the elections.
The two say they will solve the leadership question between themselves, sometime before spring. But it is Mr. Stoiber -- tall, white-haired, efficient, rigid and bland -- who would benefit most from Germany's malaise. What gives him credibility is the Bavarian model.
"Bavarians really are the Texans of Germany," said Michael Stiller of the Suddeutsche Zeitung, Bavaria's excellent newspaper. "They're very conservative and very rich, with a good economy, high technology and little unemployment. People think, 'We can get work here, we can educate our kids here.' "
Erwin Huber, Mr. Stoiber's deputy, waxes expansive: Bavaria has Germany's lowest unemployment rate, the country's highest growth rate over the last decade, and what he calls "our strong partnership with businessmen and managers, our effort to make a modern network between politics and the economy."
Unemployment in Bavaria is just under 6 percent, compared with an average in Germany of more than 9 percent and an official rate in the former East Germany of 18 percent.
It was not always like this. Before World War II, Bavaria was a rural backwater, pretty for vacations, but with a wretched infrastructure of poor roads and rail connections to the rest of Germany.
"Here it was poor and mountainous, with no connection to the sea, with the Alps to the south, and no natural resources," said Hans-Werner Sinn, director of the IFO Institute, an economic research organization here. "The heart of prewar Germany was in the east."
But after the war, with the division of the conquered nation, ties in Germany went north-south, no longer east-west, a new axis that brought a lot of companies, fleeing the new Communist state occupied by the Soviet Union, to the west.
The lack of old industry -- iron, coal and steel -- was a kind of hidden benefit, forcing Bavaria to concentrate on what was modern, becoming the Silicon Valley of Europe, or at least one of the new high-tech centers.
Politicians here pushed hard for business to come to Bavaria, developing the cozy notion of "Bavarian mercantilism," offering companies a welcoming climate, with financial incentives, good schools, improving infrastructure and help in cutting bureaucratic red tape. A lot of skilled workers came here from the Sudetenland, fleeing postwar Czechoslovakia, and more came, later, from Italy and Turkey. 
Siemens was the most prominent catch, moving from Berlin to Bavaria. Even today, Siemens dominates the scene, making everything from computers to some of the best medical diagnostic instruments in the world. Still, said Mr. Sinn, the economy's real strength here is the thousands of medium-size companies, often privately held by families, each employing 200 to 500 people.
Franz-Josef Strauss, the longtime boss of Bavaria, was a deeply conservative man, a cold warrior. But he was also a kind of economic visionary, trying to create the right climate for economic growth.
He built up one of Europe's best education systems, including fine universities, started a system of "clusters," for associated industries to grow near specialized schools that could train their employees, and spent millions on better roads, rail connections and one of Germany's largest and most modern airports, opened finally in 1992 and named after Mr. Strauss. The airport was criticized for being too large, but is already being expanded.
Mr. Stoiber, Mr. Strauss's longtime deputy, continued the tradition on taking over in 1993, says his own deputy, Mr. Huber. Interviewed here in the elegantly modern state chancellery office built around a fine older building, Mr. Huber is unashamedly a promoter of Mr. Strauss, Mr. Stoiber and all their works.
"This sense of a future with high technology makes a very strong stamp on this land," Mr. Huber said. Mr. Stoiber privatized state companies, raising more than $4.5 billion, which was invested in creating new clusters, where basic research, applied research, entrepreneurial support and venture capital could come together to create jobs.
Mr. Sinn, the economist, said that when he came here 15 years ago, he used to joke about the idea of the Silicon Valley of Europe. "But now I see the success of this strategy," he said.
Bavaria has created a cluster for environmental technology in Augsburg and for medical technology around Nuremberg, and is seeking other areas of supremacy. It is trying to develop a new cluster for biotechnology in and around Martinsried, where a Biotechnology Park is located at the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry. More than 120 pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are already there.
But Mr. Stoiber has also added a strong touch of law and order, popular in a Germany with a growing fear of foreigners and crime. The revelation that Hamburg was a center for a cell of Islamic radicals that attacked New York and Washington has brought demands for harsher immigration laws and procedures. Mr. Schroder's government has responded, but the Christian Democrats and Christian Socialists say that the new measures are not tough enough. 
The conservatives intend to try to block the new immigration proposals in the German upper house, where the government does not have a majority, and to make crime an election issue. Mr. Stoiber has also sometimes seemed less than generous about unification, criticizing the huge amounts of aid going to eastern Germany -- a populist issue for many who complain about their taxes -- and urging easterners to work harder.
The medical cluster is a good example of what makes Bavaria work. In Erlangen, near Nuremberg, Siemens dominates the town, where every fifth worker toils in the field of health care, and there is a fine university that helps train potential staff.
"Erlangen became the capital of health care in Germany with the help of the government of Bavaria," said Ulrich E. Kripps, a manager with what is called Siemens Medical Solutions, which specializes in applying computers and information technology to medical equipment. 
The company makes diagnostic imaging equipment, from ultrasound and magnetic resonance scanners to computer-assisted tomography, which can show the action of a beating heart in three dimensions. 
But the biggest problem remains the search for excellent people. "What we need are good computer engineers," Mr. Kripps said. "We need engineers, and we need them from anywhere. We have to be attractive to the best people in the world."
For that task, too, Bavaria is a help, Mr. Kripps said. "Compared to other regions in Germany, there is a real advantage to living here, in the south. People like it here."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE HEALTH THREAT; 
Anthrax Shot Considered For Civilians

BYLINE:  By WARREN E. LEARY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 15 

 BODY:
The government is considering making the anthrax vaccine that is now used by the military available to postal workers and others at high risk of exposure to the deadly bacteria, federal health officials said today.
 Tommy G. Thompson, the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, could make a decision on expanded anthrax vaccinations next week, officials said after a forum, arranged by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, on what to do next to prevent inhalation anthrax in people who have already taken antibiotics because of possible exposure. 
 The Defense Department has agreed to turn over 220,000 doses of vaccine to the health department and the Food and Drug Administration has given the disease centers permission to use the vaccine in an experimental treatment program.
Since early October, more than 32,000 persons have been given initial courses of antibiotics to counteract possible infections of anthrax from contaminated mail, officials said. Of these, about 10,000 were advised to continue taking antibiotics for 60 days because they were most likely to have been exposed. Five people have died of inhalation anthrax since the outbreak began. 
Dr. D. A. Henderson, director of the office of public health preparedness at Health and Human Services, said candidates for the vaccine would be those with possible exposure to large amounts of anthrax spores.
"We are concerned with people who may have had a very heavy dose," Dr. Henderson said after the meeting. This group, he said, probably numbers about 3,000.
Once in the body, the spores are believed to germinate into disease-causing bacteria within 60 days. But because antibiotics kill the bacteria, not the spores, there are concerns that some spores might remain after the 60-day treatment and turn deadly, experts said.
Dr. Anthony S. Fauci of the National Institutes of Health said that there was not yet a consensus among health experts on whether to offer an anthrax vaccine to civilians because the antibiotics treatment is considered sufficient. If the vaccine becomes available, patients will have to make their own decision about taking it, he said.
If the vaccine, which previously has been used only by the military and only for protection against a future exposure, becomes available for civilians, its use as a treatment after exposure would be considered experimental and require special informed consent agreements from the patients, said Dr. Katherine Zoon, an official at the Food and Drug Administration. 
Animal-test data suggests that the vaccine should be given in three doses over a month's time, while the patients are getting an additional 30-day course of antibiotics to ward off any potential disease before the vaccine takes effect, experts said at the meeting.
About 2.1 million anthrax vaccine doses have been administered to 521,000 members of the military with few severe adverse effects, experts said. While most reactions are mild, including redness, itching and swelling at the inoculation site, severe allergic reactions have been seen in 1 in 100,000 cases, they said.
Dr. Ivan Walks, health commissioner for the District of Columbia, said any vaccine program should be accompanied by education and communication programs directed at various economic and racial groups. He reminded participants that when antibiotics were recommended early in the crisis, some postal workers voiced concerns that they were not tested and treated as quickly as workers on Capitol Hill who were exposed to anthrax from tainted mail in the offices of senators.
Al Ferranto of the National Association of Letter Carriers also cautioned the policy makers to consider how any vaccine recommendation might affect postal workers, who tend to be older than soldiers, with some having diabetes and other medical problems. He asked health authorities to look at "the big picture," including how a vaccine program might hurt confidence in the postal system.

HEADLINE: The World; 
The Morning After Dawns on Moscow

BYLINE:  By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
UNTIL last week, Russia and its leader were on a roll. In this season of strategic realignment and war against terror, Russia once again became central to American foreign policy and it seemed that one of the big winners was its president, Vladimir V. Putin. Then came President Bush's announcement that the United States was pulling out of theAntiballistic Missile Treaty of 1972.
Now a question arises: In the most interesting game of diplomatic casino in decades, between the son of a former C.I.A. chief and a man who grew up in the K.G.B., who is getting the better of whom?
 After the inferno of Sept. 11, no foreign power acted as swiftly and decisively as Russia to offer intelligence support, air rights and a free hand for United States military forces to fly into bases in Central Asia to conduct their war in Afghanistan. 
 And no one gained from that cooperation more than Mr. Putin. His exposure at Mr. Bush's side in four summit meetings stripped away much of the negative image he had in the West -- as a former K.G.B. officer who had brutalized Chechnya and stifled Moscow's independent news media.
Now, with victory in sight in Afghanistan, President Bush's decision to pull the plug on the ABM treaty, which had come to preoccupy the affairs of the two big nuclear powers, raises the question whether Mr. Bush is moving on from his Russian dalliance. 
If foreign policy was a song, said Toby T. Gati, the Russia specialist who was the State Department's intelligence chief in the Clinton administration, Mr. Bush's actions brought to mind the Paul Simon refrain, "Fifty ways to leave your lover." An aide to Mr. Powell had a similar thought, likening the question on the minds of Russian parliament members who recently met with Mr.Powell to another song: "Will you still love me tomorrow?"
Those Russian legislators did not know that the ABM announcement was coming, but they were already concerned that Mr. Putin's decision to align Russia squarely with the United States, to open the doors of Central Asia to American forces and to renew Russia's embrace of the NATO alliance could backfire -- if it turned out that Mr. Bush was simply "playing" Mr. Putin to win support for American war aims.
That would be rich irony, since some of Mr. Bush's American critics have grumbled for many months that Mr. Putin has been using wiles learned in K.G.B. days to manipulate the American president.
It was, after all, Mr. Bush who said he had looked into Mr. Putin's soul and found a partner to be trusted. And now, in Afghanistan, America was fighting the war against terrorism that Mr. Putin wanted. Russia did not have to contribute a single soldier for the military operations. But it gained immensely from them, stanching the flow of heroin from Afghanistan and cutting the infiltration routes of Islamic militants who have been part of the Chechen rebellion.
For three months, Mr. Putin has cheered America from the sidelines, offering political support at the United Nations and opening for Washington a library of Russian intelligence dossiers on Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda's terror network, which has plagued Russia and Central Asia for years.
"Putin now had the Americans doing his business in Afghanistan and he was fighting to the last American," Ms. Gati said.
When Kabul, the Afghan capital, fell last month, the Russian-backed Northern Alliance was the first to claim the city. Russia's guys had won. A dozen Russian air transports flew in to Kabul even as British and French troops -- hoping to play a role in the security and humanitarian chores of liberation -- were barred from entry by the Northern Alliance and by Gen. Tommy Franks, the American commander.
For Russia, it was clear that America did not want to stay in Central Asia and, therefore, Russia's role there -- as a member of the coalition and a new American partner -- would gain legitimacy even though the whole region's newly independent leaders had spent the last decade straining to keep Moscow at arm's length. Russia was back in the great game, garnering influence and a chance to dominate oil and gas extraction in the region because all roads there -- especially pipeline routes -- lead to Russia.
And there was more. Saudi Arabia's image has been suffering from the discovery that so many of its mosques were infested with bin Laden radicalism. Mr. Putin deftly suggested that Russia -- with its abundant energy resources and pipeline network -- could assume the role of a critical supplier of energy to the West if the Arabian peninsula was convulsed by instability.
But if that was a clear vision of how things looked last week, to many in Moscow it now feels like the morning after.
Mr. Putin's first reaction to the ABM decision was tempered, as Washington had hoped. No hysterical recriminations in public. The decision was a mistake, he said, but it "does not create a threat to the national security of the Russian federation."
Where does that leave Russia now in American foreign policy? Mr. Putin and the political establishment that has been supporting him would certainly like to know.
Ivo Daalder, a Brookings Institution specialist on Russia who served under President Clinton, wonders whether Russian-American relations "can endure and become stronger even with this big blot" on the ledger. Russian cooperation might slowly dry up again in critical areas, like securing Russian nuclear weapons and their radiological innards that many terrorists would like to get their hands on.
"I don't know the answer," Mr. Daalder said, "but I fear the worst."
The reason a number of specialists are thinking so darkly about the long-term impact of Mr. Bush's ABM decision is that the Russians see -- as Americans can see -- that there is an ideological struggle going on within the Bush administration and Russia policy is often the fulcrum of that debate. To some of Mr. Bush's advisers, it is a mistake to give Russia an exalted status; they think it just doesn't deserve it, given its decline and its geopolitical irrelevance in a globalized economy. 
A month ago, Mr. Bush promised Mr. Putin at their meeting in Crawford, Tex., that the United States would welcome Russia into NATO's decision-making councils. But Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld sought to remove from a press statement all references to "NATO at 20" -- the new characterization of 19 NATO members sitting with Russia as an alliance of 20 nations.
Mr. Rumsfeld lost the battle, but his intervention delayed the debate over how to integrate Russia into the alliance. One thing the hard-liners wanted to insure was that Russia would not get to influence next year's round of NATO enlargement, in which as many as nine new nations will enter. 
AT week's end, the White House statement welcoming Mr. Putin's acceptance of the ABM decision was conspicuously void of any reference to Russia's role in Western security and seemed to drive home the new reality that the strategic chips are falling exclusively in America's favor. 
"Raw national interests dictate that other countries" -- including Russia -- "will continue to cooperate with us when it is in their interest to do so," Mr. Daalder pointed out. But in the long run, he said, Russia's disappointment over the ABM treaty could end "the presumption of future cooperation that has been so central to our relations with allies and friends around the world."

HEADLINE: PRO BASKETBALL: INSIDE THE N.B.A.; 
Stern's Look to a Future on Cable TV Will Put NBC in the Past

BYLINE:  By MIKE WISE

 BODY:
It began as a win-win relationship more than a decade ago. David Stern had the players, Dick Ebersol rolled the cameras, and away they went, promoting each other's products until the world started paying attention.
 Together they made lots of money and commercials and guided the National Basketball Association to the pinnacle of popularity. To gauge the league's mass-culture growth since 1990, one need only see the Palestinian youth in the background of a recent CNN report wearing the No. 23 Chicago Bulls jersey. 
 But now they are parting ways. Michael Jordan's second retirement in 1998 did not help. Neither did a contentious lockout that cost the league 32 of its games in the 1998-99 season. 
Ratings initially dipped, then spiraled downward -- a 35 percent drop from the end of the 1997-98 season. NBC was losing an average of $90 million a year on its deal with the N.B.A.
Rivalries developed too slowly to capture the public's imagination. The icons who came after Michael, Magic and Larry were fading as well.
With Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant fighting off Allen Iverson last June in the N.B.A. finals, the N.B.A. and NBC seemed to be on their way back. Ratings were coming back. But the end was nearing.
Although it will most likely not be official until this week, Stern, the N.B.A. commissioner, and Ebersol, the chairman of NBC Sports, are ending their business partnership, and the league will sign a rights agreement with ABC and ESPN to carry N.B.A. games.
 As the incumbent, NBC was supposed to have an edge over ABC-ESPN, mainly because of Stern and Ebersol's 12-year association. Also, the idea of multiple cable networks competing for viewers and advertising dollars was not supposed to be a viable alternative for the N.B.A. when negotiations began. But in a depressed economy -- some of which was caused by the Sept. 11 tragedies -- Stern gambled. 
Beyond the deal with ABC-ESPN, he entered into an agreement with AOL Time Warner that would allow the league to create its own channel with the company. AOL Time Warner is the parent company of Turner Sports, which holds the cable part of the league's television package.
More than 100 games would be shown on the new channel, which would probably replace the AOL-owned CNN/SI. Some games would remain on TNT. 
As the most forward-thinking businessman among sports commissioners, Stern has made an asset play for his owners. Given that the N.B.A. already owns a store and a restaurant, a channel televising its games seems a logical progression. 
Rather than only a rights-fee agreement, Stern's newest deal becomes a business-building venture for his owners.
Selling the AOL network deal to fans may initially be tough, especially the ones who do not get CNN/SI. But the league could make an argument that the prior agreement had almost overexposed the N.B.A. the past two seasons. That is why Ebersol began eliminating Saturday games on NBC this season.
And as a property, the N.B.A. will probably do better on ESPN, the recognized sports leader in the cable industry.
"The N.B.A. is operating right now in a severely depressed economy," said Neil Pilson, the former head of CBS Sports and now an industry analyst. "If they can maintain their current level of income, with the significant drop in revenue stream from TV rights fees, that's a significant achievement. If on top of that they can generate a growth in the asset value of a property like AOL Sports, the Basketball Channel, or whatever they call it, that is a major growth opportunity at a time when the economy is quite depressed."
NBC has now lost the National Football League, Major League Baseball and the N.B.A. within a span of a few years. Ebersol could no longer hold on to the network's last jewel. It was no longer valuable enough.
"They certainly have given that impression that they're close personally and professionally," Pilson said of Stern and Ebersol. "But David's obligation is to his owners and Dick's obligation is to his shareholders. If the gap was too great, then NBC was going to have to let it go. Especially if you're talking about anticipated lost dollars."
More than anything, the economy and the declining interest in the league broke them up.

Bedtime for Van Gundy
 A week after Jeff Van Gundy's surprising resignation as coach of the Knicks, conspiracy theories are still running amok.
While the unemployed coach continues his Christmas shopping, here's a quick attempt to debunk at least a few of the rumors.
 Will Van Gundy end up in Miami with Pat Riley?
No. Stan Van Gundy, Jeff's brother, has all but been promised the head coaching job when Riley steps down. Only if Stan moved to another team would his brother consider moving south.
Portland would be a shoo-in for Van Gundy if Maurice Cheeks faltered after one season. Talented roster. Paul Allen's money. All in all, a good fit.
But Philadelphia would make more sense if Larry Brown stepped down after this season. It might be easier to take the 76ers back to the finals than ever getting the beleaguered Trail Blazers there.
Don't rule out Golden State, where Dave Cowens was fired yesterday. The Warriors are big and young, and moving Antawn Jamison could bring back another potential All-Star. Also, compared to the intense scrutiny in New York, you can almost coach under the radar in the Bay Area.
 Was there a secret pact with another team that made Van Gundy leave as much as $8 million on the table by walking away from the Knicks?
Again, no. First off, Van Gundy is not very good with a fax machine or with e-mail messages. Second, he understands that he will get another job in due time.
Did Van Gundy leave because of his utter frustration with Knicks management?
Yes, partly. He understood that the Knicks were further from winning a title today than they were when he took the job, that they simply had no real inside presence to advance in the playoffs.
And, yes, he would have liked a contract extension after the team denied him permission to talk to Portland about its coaching vacancy last summer.
Most of all, Van Gundy was so beaten down by his job that not even winning provided solace anymore. Like many people, he wanted to decompress, take a sabbatical and be with his family. And he had the financial wherewithal to do it. 
That he should be ridiculed for such a decision -- quitter was the word used most by several fans and journalists last week -- tells you more about his detractors than about Van Gundy.
 What is it about coaches and athletes leaving New York before New York leaves them that makes the town turn into a scorned lover? It is so provincial to knock people for wanting to leave the fish-bowl existence, the fish bowl they have given every amount of their passion and energy to.
Van Gundy could not possibly find more quality of life elsewhere? When was the last time an organization asked a coach it was thinking about firing if he wanted to finish out his deal? It works both ways. 
Van Gundy has 37 N.B.A. playoff victories at age 39. He ranks third in coaching victories in Knicks history. He had to do his job in a much more critical environment than Joe Lapchick or Red Holzman. He has a better postseason winning percentage than George Karl or Don Nelson. He worked hard and won much more than he lost. Enough already. Let him sleep.

Issel at Center of Controversy
The pressure is starting to subside for Dan Issel, and it looks as if he will keep his job.
On Thursday, Hispanic groups launched a boycott of the team, demanding that Issel be replaced as coach after he shouted an insensitive ethnic remark and a profanity at a Hispanic fan in the crowd. After Issel apologized to a group of Hispanic leaders Friday, the boycott was dropped.
Issel has been suspended for four games by the Nuggets, but many people feel his actions deserve a stronger punishment. The League of United Latin American Citizens, based in Washington, said Issel should resign.
As Issel walked off the court after a 99-96 loss to the Charlotte Hornets on Tuesday night, he went back and forth with a fan in the stands. He was caught on camera exclaiming, "Go drink another beer, you Mexican. . . ." He added an expletive at the end of the sentence. 
Issel, openly weeping during a news conference the next day, apologized to the team, the community and the fan. His suspension will cost him $112,000.
Issel's supporters have rallied around the coach. They do not want one ugly moment to stain his reputation forever.
"Everyone in the locker room knows Dan the man, and he is not a racist," Nuggets forward George McCloud said. "It was a situation where his emotions were running, frustrated by the fact we are losing."
Dialogue between the team and the Hispanic organizations may help bring about a resolution that could save Issel's job. But even if that happens, it should not mask recent history. 
While coaching the Nets, John Calipari was fined $25,000 by the league and reprimanded by the team for referring to a Hispanic reporter covering the team as "a Mexican idiot." 
Long after the incident, players and team officials joked among themselves about Calipari's comment, the idea being that it was almost O.K. to poke fun at the reporter because of his ethnicity.
But no one dares to use derogatory language in regard to any white or black player's ethnicity. That is off limits. The same double standard exists with the use of Indian mascots. Somehow, Redskins is still acceptable in our culture. Imagine the outcry if the team were named the Washington Blackskins. 
Should Issel have lost his job? Without a pattern of racial insensitivity over time, probably not. 
And the proximity of N.B.A. fans to the action contributes to such ugly altercations. Simply, enraged people can get closer to players and coaches in pro basketball than they can in any other major sport during an event.
But like many basketball lifers who see only black and white, Issel could do well to stay away from derogatory remarks about other ethnic groups who are barely represented in the N.B.A.

A New Sense of Urgency in Debating the Future of Airlines

BYLINE:  By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
Long before Sept. 11, many executives, analysts and consultants were convinced that the airline industry had fundamental problems. Even in the best years, returns lagged those of other industries. And recently, with profits slim to nonexistent, the calls for better service, cheaper fares, more public accountability and tighter security have grown louder and louder.
 Now, after the attacks, which presented the biggest commercial threat to the airlines in aviation history, the question of the industry's future has taken on new urgency. 
 The events would appear to strengthen the hand of those who argue that the industry will never satisfy passengers and investors until it is concentrated among fewer, more profitable companies. But whether significant change will occur in the next year is an open question.
Even some of the most vocal proponents of consolidation say it is no panacea. Furthermore, powerful forces, notably labor unions and lawmakers eager to appeal to consumers or support their hometown airlines, strongly oppose it. The new board overseeing the $10 billion loan guarantee program passed by Congress 10 days after the attacks has the power to remake the industry, but it could also end up insulating it from market forces.
"The business model of the existing companies is just flat-out broken," Kevin Murphy, the aviation analyst at Morgan Stanley, said. It is a mantra that he and others in the industry have been chanting for years.
In January, Mr. Murphy issued a joint study with the consulting firm Stern Stewart that concluded that the airline industry had created little wealth and had not earned a return exceeding its cost of capital for most of the years since the industry was deregulated in 1978.
From 1997 to 2001, the industry generated a return on capital lower than the average of the companies that make up the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, even though the industry reported record profits in three of the four years. Another steep down cycle began this year and has accelerated with the decline in passenger traffic after the September hijackings. Industry losses this year could reach $10 billion.
Mr. Murphy's conclusion is that airlines are unlikely to generate acceptable returns until there are more mergers, acquisitions and cross-border ownership, which is now restricted by laws that prevent foreign control of domestic carriers.
Fewer airlines, proponents argue, would increase efficiency by letting the survivors extend their networks, make better use of management expertise and, most important, eliminate overcapacity so airlines could raise fares. Of course, there would be less competition, Mr. Murphy said, but airlines need to earn a better return to attract more capital, and in turn passengers will benefit through better service.
But opponents of consolidation argue that it would not solve the industry's problem. "If the industry can't earn its cost of capital unconsolidated, it won't earn it after consolidation," said Michael E. Levine, a former airline executive who now teaches at Harvard Law School.
He argues that fewer, larger airlines would simply increase the leverage of the industry's already powerful unions, enabling them to siphon off any higher profits in the form of higher wages and benefits.
In addition, high concentration in a network business like the airlines would hinder competition because the more extensive route networks of the one or two top airlines would tend to attract a larger proportion of the traveling public.
This was one of the dangers, critics said, posed by the agreement earlier this year between United Airlines and American Airlines to divide up the assets of US Airways, creating two mega-carriers that together would have controlled half the market.
"Nobody knows how many competitive airline networks are needed," Mr. Levine said. "But it is better to have four or five partially complete airline networks competing with one another rather than two complete networks."
The Justice Department's antitrust division appeared to make the consolidation debate a moot point last summer when it blocked United's $4.3 billion bid for US Airways, calling it anticompetitive.
But Sept. 11 renewed the speculation about mergers. Some experts argue that the industry is in such trouble that deals could be approved under a provision of the antitrust laws that gives preference to companies that would go out of business if they were not bought by competitors.
The Air Transportation Stabilization Board, which was created by Congress to decide which airlines would receive some of the $10 billion in loan guarantees, has the power to compel airlines to merge if they want access to credit.
If cash aid and loans can keep airlines flying until ticket sales return to normal, the structure of the industry will probably not change much. But that may be a tall order.
The best course, according to Darryl Jenkins, the director of the Aviation Institute at George Washington University, would be for weak carriers to fade away. Airline mergers, he wrote recently, "raise costs above any potential expected benefits" because integrating healthy carriers is disruptive.
"Sept. 11 has speeded up what was looming: the need to restructure and reduce costs," he added. "Mergers will move the industry in the wrong direction."

Falling Trade Barriers Will Pose a Challenge For China's Economy

BYLINE:  By CRAIG S. SMITH 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI 

 BODY:
Its restaurants are full, its airplanes are packed and its always volatile stock market is looking remarkably steady. While much of the world skids toward economic recession, China is showing off to the world the upside of a still largely closed and tightly controlled economy.
 That economy -- the gross domestic product already ranks sixth in the world, according to the World Bank -- is on track to expand by more than 7 percent this year and is not likely to slow much in 2002. In contrast, the United States, Japan and Europe are expected to experience this year their first collective contraction since the oil price shock of the mid-1970's, with little likelihood of a recovery before the second half of 2002. 
 China has been able to defy economic gravity thanks largely to two phenomena: foreign exchange controls that prevent money pumped into the economy from leaking out, and the benefit of a continental economy with a consumer market big enough to potentially drive growth on its own.
A far bigger challenge to China than a global slowdown is the country's membership in the World Trade Organization, which took effect last Tuesday. Trade barriers will begin to fall next year, setting off a multinational rush to grab a piece of China's promising market of 1.3 billion people.
That is expected to send the country's imports surging, surpassing the growth of its exports and eroding the country's enviable trade surplus, which widened to $3.9 billion in October, bringing its 10-month trade surplus to $17.3 billion.
Yet, while W.T.O. membership will widen access to its market, the country is certain to guard its economy and find ways to protect domestic sectors whose survival is threatened by foreign competition. Already, new rules on the import of genetically modified crops briefly disrupted American soybean imports, until recently the country's highest-volume agricultural import.
The country's export growth will most certainly take a hit from a drop in consumer spending in the United States, Chinese government economists say. But China's export growth was already shrinking before the Sept. 11 attacks, and exports to the United States, its second-largest trading partner after Japan, account for only about 9 percent of China's gross domestic product. Other big trading partners include the European Union and Southeast Asia. Trade is growing, but the rate is slowing.
China has been deliberately weaning its economy off what had been a growing dependence on exports ever since the Asian export glut of the late 1990's crippled other export-dependent economies in the region. In 2000 exports totaled $249.21 billion, the Chinese government reported, or nearly a quarter of the $1.077 trillion gross domestic product. Economists inside and outside China predict that export growth will drop to around 5 percent this year, down from 28 percent in 2000.
In 1998, Beijing began spending heavily to keep economic growth from shrinking as economies around Asia tipped into recession. It has not stopped: this year, even more government spending will pour into public work projects, like roads, dams and high-voltage electrical lines that will light previously darkened villages. The country borrowed $18 billion through the sale of special stimulus bonds this year to help keep the economy growing and Finance Minister Xiang Huaicheng has promised to issue the same amount next year.
Beijing has also worked mightily to get China's people to spend more money. One of the most visible strategies has been to extend the country's most important holidays to a full week each. The efforts have gradually had the desired effect: consumer spending has steadily increased, retail sales are on the rise and a long battle with deflation appears to be ending in apparent victory. Retail sales rose about 10 percent in the first 10 months of the year, and most economists expect consumer prices, which were falling in the late 1990's, to edge up about 1 percent annually this year and next.
Western analysts estimate that China's domestic consumer spending will rise 9 percent or more this year from 2000, roughly two percentage points more than G.D.P. growth for the year, far stronger than most of the world's economies.
Unlike many other economies around the world, China's vast economy barely registered a tremor from the Sept. 11 attacks.
First of all, most Chinese feel more secure today than they have at any point in their lives. China is now entering its third decade of shifting from a centrally planned to a market-driven economy. During that time the economy has grown swiftly and steadily and China has had its longest stretch of social stability in a century, excepting the demonstrations and their bloody suppression in the summer of 1989.
While Beijing is criticized abroad for its repressive security apparatus and human rights abuses, few Chinese feel oppressed by their government. Most support the government's strong-arm tactics as necessary for maintaining order, and feel immune from the sort of terrorist attacks that have rattled confidence in the United States.
Nor are the attacks likely to weaken capital flows here. With China joining the W.T.O., its strong economic growth and vast consumer market make it one of the few targets for investment on embattled American executives' radar screens.
"Multinational corporations are consolidating their operations at home and moving to China," said Andy Xie, an economist at Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong. "Sept. 11 accelerates this trend."
Motorola has said it will invest $6.6 billion in China in the next five years at a time when demand for telecomunications gear in Europe and the United States has slackened. Ericsson of Sweden said earlier this month that it would create thousands of jobs in China and triple exports from the country by 2005, even as it trims jobs elsewhere.
The most obvious impact that China is likely to see from the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, barring a global recession (which it still might be able to spend its way through), is a measurably higher fiscal deficit as it spends to make up for slowing export growth. Beijing expects to run a record 260 billion yuan ($31.4 billion) budget deficit this year, equal to 2.6 percent of G.D.P., up from 0.8 percent in 1997.

To the Editor:
 Re "States Calling for More Help With Medicaid" (news article, Dec. 10): In New York, there have been more than 100,000 new Medicaid applicants since the state began its disaster-relief Medicaid program after the events of Sept. 11. This dramatic response brings to the fore a significant problem: the many people in need of health coverage but not enrolled in programs. 
 Disaster-relief Medicaid is an example of the government's responding quickly and appropriately to a crisis by streamlining the Medicaid application process and the eligibility requirements. Keeping people uninsured is poor fiscal policy, as they tend to come in for treatment at a later stage of illness, adding to the cost of medical care. Enrolling people in health coverage is the fiscal equivalent of preventive health, benefiting not just the uninsured but also hospitals and taxpayers.

With the U.S. Economy Slumping, Canada and Mexico Are Reeling

BYLINE:  By ANTHONY DePALMA 

 BODY:
While the slowdown in the United States has roiled all national economies, no countries were hit earlier or harder than the two that are closest to and most thoroughly integrated with the American economy -- Canada and Mexico.
 As partners with the United States in the North American Free Trade Agreement, Canada and Mexico -- both heavily reliant on exports -- now trade more with the United States than do any other nations. Each sends more than 85 percent of its exports to the United States, and gets a similar percentage of its imports from the United States. But when Americans stop buying, that mighty stream -- which once totaled more than $2 billion a day -- dries up, stranding many businesses and tens of thousands of workers. 
 What these two neighbors are learning is a hard lesson in economic realpolitik: grow with America, go slow with America. Their dependence on the economic engine of the United States -- which kept their own economies humming during the American expansion -- is so complete that they are now essentially powerless to do much but wait for the United States economy to get going again. 
"This is the price both countries are paying for their close integration with the United States," said Riordan Roett, director of the Western Hemisphere Program at the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University. "They benefit greatly when the United States grows, but when there is a downturn they feel the social and economic consequences immediately."
Since the United States economy exerts such a pull on the global market, watching close neighbors like Canada and Mexico can give some sense of what will happen elsewhere. In that sense, the two nations resemble canaries in a mine shaft, early warning systems of shrinking markets for other economies around the world that trade with the United States.
Economists and government officials in Canada and Mexico expect to see the American economy begin to turn around no later than the second half of 2002. Although the recovery is not expected to bring a sudden repeat of the boom years of the late 1990's, the expected increase in American economic activity is considered sufficient stimulus to make substantial improvements in the financial pictures across the northern and southern borders.
Economists expect there will be a slight lag -- three months or so -- between the beginning of a recovery in the United States and a corresponding turnaround in economic activities across the borders. However, the picture could be complicated by factors unique to each country.
In Canada, a bitter dispute over lumber exports to the United States is having a serious economic impact throughout western Canada. Tourism and the weak Canadian dollar will also be watched carefully as 2002 begins.
In Mexico, a continued slump in oil prices could complicate the country's recovery. If President Vicente Fox is able to push through a tax restructuring, it will go a long way toward setting the tone of Mexico's economic comeback. The change had been widely anticipated when Mr. Fox took office a year ago, but was ultimately tied up by a recalcitrant Mexican Congress. Now he is ready to try again.
Surveying North America's prospects for 2002, Roger M. Kubarych, an adjunct senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and senior economic adviser for HVB Americas, a part of the large German bank group HypoVereinsbank, is worried about the slowdown in industrial production, which began in the United States last year and is spreading north and south.
For Mexico, the impact will be severe. As the country recovered from the peso crisis of 1994-1995, the industrial sector led the way, pumping out car radios, clothing and other goods to such an extent that exports to the United States have soared 175 percent since 1994, the year Nafta went into effect.
Over the years Canada, too, has grown increasingly linked to American industry. Many large international companies, led by the Big Three auto manufacturers, have reorganized their North American operations into separate divisions, neither foreign nor domestic.
Given such complete integration, "times are tough for manufacturers North America-wide," Mr. Kubarych said.
Canada still has a big inventory of industrial goods that will carry over to 2002. As companies stop production to sell warehoused goods, unemployment -- at 4.7 percent this year -- could rise to about 6.1 percent in 2002, according to economists at J. P. Morgan Chase.
Canada will also have to deal with a low currency exchange rate. Although the Canadian dollar has edged up from a record low of 62.4 United States cents reached on Nov. 9, it is far below historic levels. And Canada will struggle to overcome devastating cutbacks in high-technology manufacturing, a field that had become one of the country's most important sources of new jobs. High-technology giants like Nortel Networks, a Canadian company, and JDS Uniphase, which has sizable operations in Canada, cut thousands of jobs in 2001 as sales of telecommunications equipment slumped badly. With business down, many investors turned their backs on the companies, and stock prices plunged.
"Canada bought into the notion that high tech is the future," Mr. Kubarych said. "So the decline in high tech is particularly bad for Canada." However, he said, the worst may be past.
A recent poll of Canadian chief executives showed an emerging optimism. Just over half of those surveyed by Compas Inc., a Canadian polling company, predicted that the country's economy would do better in the coming six months. Just a month earlier, in October, only 36 percent of chief executives held that view.
George D. Vasic, chief economist of UBS Warburg in Toronto, said there were several reasons for optimism in Canada. A program of tax cuts for 2002, approved in 2001, could help buoy the economy, he said, provided the downturn does not last too long. Interest rates have dropped steadily, although they remain above rates in the United States. The government forecast for 2002 is for 1.5 percent growth in gross domestic product, about the same as this year.
Beyond that, Mr. Vasic said, what had once seemed to be intimidating aspects of the coming year have been ameliorated. A tightening of the border after Sept. 11 seemed to presage a slowdown in the transfer of goods, but a report in November by Statistics Canada, the government's central statistical agency, did not find any impact on economic activity caused by delays at the border. To make sure border traffic keeps flowing, Ottawa has earmarked over $300 million for bridges, roads and new security technology.
And while it seemed for a while that the terrorist attacks would cut into Canada's tourism revenues by making people afraid to fly, it now seems that Canada might actually benefit because Americans can drive to Canadian vacation destinations.
Tourism is important to Mexico, too. On a visit to New York in November, Guillermo Ortiz, the governor of Mexico's central bank, said tourism revenues would decline over all even if many American tourists choose to drive across the border into Northern Mexico because many of Mexico's largest and most profitable tourist destinations are far from the border.
The weakened economy in the United States will mean decreased Mexican exports, less direct foreign investment and delays in the start of important new manufacturing projects, Mr. Ortiz said.
Mr. Ortiz expects the United States economy to recover in the second half of 2002, with Mexico following close behind. Mexico will grow at a 1.5 percent rate in 2002, he said, but he acknowledged that his estimates were based on a price of $19 a barrel for Mexican crude oil by the end of 2001 and $16 to $17 a barrel for 2002, which most experts say is several dollars too high.
Though petroleum revenues remain an important part of the Mexican government's income, oil represents less than 10 percent of Mexico's exports. Even a drastic decline in oil prices is not expected to cause the kind of severe problems that occurred in the 1970's and 1980's, when the Mexican economy was dominated by oil.
With the peso relatively stable and with foreign banks acquiring several Mexican banks to give the industry a firmer footing, the country is in much better shape to withstand economic uncertainties than at any time in the past. Many economists think that even a complete collapse in Argentina would not hurt Mexico severely.
"Mexico would have to live with a higher cost of capital than would be the case if Argentina's problems were resolved more smoothly," said Michael Gavin, executive director of emerging market research for UBS Warburg. "But Mexico is fundamentally a pretty solid story."

A Bruised Economy Leaves Everyone Guessing

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
THE last two years have made spectacularly clear what the legacy of the decade-long economic expansion will not be. The coming year should go a long way toward determining what its legacy really will be.
 The boom did not rewrite the rules for valuing stocks, as many investors had thought less than two years ago. It did not promise a future without recessions, as many boosters were still predicting a year ago. It did not even herald the start of a new era of government surpluses, as nearly all analysts had expected earlier this year. 
 But for all of its now-apparent excesses, and for all of the hangovers those excesses have caused, the 1990's boom still has a solid claim on being the most important, broad-based expansion in 30 years. The question that now hangs over the $10 trillion United States economy is whether the 90's brought prosperity by anticipating the riches that the future would hold or simply by borrowing against that future. 
For now, even nine months into the first recession in a decade, the nation looks quite different than it did before the long boom. A 25-year period in which workers' raises were all but erased by inflation has ended. Companies are making leaps of efficiency they had not been able to make for decades.
Although the downturn and the terrorist attacks have recently shaken Americans' confidence, they remain far more optimistic than they were for most of the 1970's and 1980's. Few people express envy today for other countries' economic systems, in clear contrast to the public discussion about Japan and Europe in past decades.
This would be a towering legacy. Whether it proves to be less fleeting than the notion that the business cycle had been repealed depends on the way that the country emerges from the current recession.
A return to strong, sustainable growth by the end of 2002 would suggest that the digital revolution, along with a handful of other changes, truly did alter American business, making it far more productive and allowing it to increase its profits and its workers' wages at the same time. A deep recession -- or, more likely, a slow recovery that remains uneven for years -- would confirm fears that the Roaring 90's depended on a stock market bubble and an explosion of debt for much of its glory.
"When you introduce important changes, any kind of complicated system like our economy is very likely to go through these periods of surges and enthusiasm and then disappointment," said Robert Hall, a Stanford University economist and the chairman of a committee considered the official arbiter of when recessions begin and end.
"In a year or two, we'll know a lot more" about whether the enthusiasm or the disappointment will prevail, Mr. Hall added.
In many ways, the picture is brighter than it was immediately after Sept. 11. New security measures do not seem to have damaged the efficiency of companies significantly. Lower energy prices and interest rates have left consumers and executives with cash to spend.
All of this has reduced the chances that the current downturn will stretch well into 2002 and rival the 16-month recession of 1973-75 as the longest since World War II.
The biggest issue, however, is not when the recovery will begin. It is whether the robust growth of the late 90's and 2000 was an aberration or the new norm.
On this question, there are strong indications that more disappointment is still in store for the nation.
Most immediately, unemployment is almost certain to rise for much of 2002. In recessions, companies usually continue to cut their costs, including their payrolls, until they are certain that revenues are growing at a healthy rate again.
By the time each recession of the last four decades had run its course, the number of jobs fell 1.4 percent to as much as 3 percent, relative to its peak. Through November of this year, the drop was less than 1 percent -- suggesting that the United States could lose another 600,000 jobs, or more, next year. That would make the days of 4 percent unemployment -- the norm in the late 90's -- feel far away.
Of course, for all the pain that they bring, layoffs are a part of every downturn. Many economists say that the United States has prospered in part because it allows companies to get rid of workers with ease, making businesses both efficient and readily willing to hire new workers.
"The United States has been extremely pragmatic and extremely aggressive," said Craig R. Barrett, the chief executive of Intel, adding that relatively low trade barriers have similarly forced American companies to become more competitive.
But there are reasons to worry that the job market could remain weak for months, much as it did in the early 1990's. This time, a big cause would be the same boom in corporate investment -- much of it in new technology -- that was a centerpiece of the long expansion.
By themselves, those investments created hundreds of thousands of new jobs for people to build semiconductors, computers, engines and warehouses. The investments also made their owners more productive, letting them increase profits and expand.
Those profits, along with a dose of exuberance that was at least partly irrational, sent the Dow Jones industrial average from less than 3,000 when the expansion began to 11,750 at its peak two years ago and still more than 9,800 today. With more money in both their retirement accounts and their paychecks, consumers kept buying new products, and companies responded by making yet more investments.
In the last year, however, it became obvious that they bought more equipment than they could profitably use. In other words, the nation inadvertently borrowed against future economic growth by creating jobs and opening factories it was not yet ready for.
"We really had a capital investment bubble," said William S. Stavropoulos, the chairman of Dow Chemical. "The overhang is unbelievable."
The payback will continue into 2002. American industrial companies are now using less of their capacity than they have at any point in almost two decades -- only about 75 percent in recent months, down from 83 percent early last year. Many high-technology industries are making fewer products, relative to the amount of the machinery they own, than they have since the government began keeping capacity statistics in the 1940's.
"People saw the benefits of e-commerce and digitization, but it became a race in which you didn't want to be left out," said Robert L. Nardelli, the chief executive of Home Depot.
The spending binge that both businesses and consumers went on means that there is unlikely to be the pent-up demand that usually greets the end of a recession. There are not a huge number of companies that need new equipment but simply cannot afford it. The country is not filled with households that have held onto an old dishwasher or car for months and will quickly buy a new one as soon as their optimism returns.
This dearth of demand threatens to undercut the aspect of the 90's boom that affected more Americans than any other. From the mid-70's to the mid-90's, median family income remained stuck at around $45,000, adjusted backward for inflation, according to the Economic Policy Institute. The value of benefits increased over the same period, but so did the number of hours a typical family worked, as wives increasingly took jobs outside the home. Many people were working harder simply to maintain their standard of living.
That changed in the second half of the 90's, as brisk demand sent the unemployment rate to its lowest level in 30 years. Median family income leaped to almost $51,000 -- giving it roughly the same gain in the last five years of the 90's as in the previous quarter-century.
The good old days of the 1960's, when wages last rose at a healthy clip, seemed to have returned. "For the first time in decades," said Jared Bernstein, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, "you had employers chasing workers, rather than the other way around."
Mirroring the rise in incomes, many social ills -- poverty, crime, pregnancy among teenagers -- declined, and the government decided it could tighten welfare benefits without worrying that many thousands of people would become homeless. The current downturn has the potential to reverse these gains after the safety net has been weakened -- or to solidify the gains, proving the broad improvement in living standards to be more lasting than dot-com mania.
One deciding factor will be the rate of increase in productivity -- what the average worker accomplishes in an hour. When productivity is rising rapidly, living standards improve, and wages and profits can increase without setting off inflation.
In the late 1990's, productivity growth accelerated to about 2.5 percent a year, after more than two decades of averaging less than 1.5 percent. That may sound insignificant, but a percentage-point increase in productivity would translate into almost $3 trillion of additional growth for the $10 trillion United States economy over the next 20 years.
In fact, the recent jump in productivity convinced the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, that he and his colleagues could keep interest rates low, even as the unemployment rate fell and economic theory suggested inflation would accelerate. He was right. Inflation remained mild, and millions of workers benefited from new jobs and higher pay. The experience is one of the decade's most significant legacies for future policy makers.
There is no magic-bullet theory that explains the recent rise in productivity, but most analysts agree that technology played a crucial role. They also say that the recent growth rate is unsustainable.
"There were factors at work that will not continue for the next four or five years," said William Lewis, the director of a research institute at McKinsey & Company, the consulting firm, who oversaw a recent productivity study.
For example, the bull market made financial service companies more productive, according to the government's data, because they were making much higher profits, Mr. Lewis said. The rise in stocks also caused many consumers to buy higher-priced items, making retailers appear more efficient.
Once these one-time effects recede, the Internet will take its place alongside the airplane and Interstate highways as just one of many reasons productivity continues to rise.
"The notion that it was significant is true," Robert E. Rubin, the former Treasury secretary and now an executive at Citigroup, said of the new technology. "The notion that it was dramatically different than other developments over the last century is not sensible."
Based on this popular view, the productivity rate should settle somewhere between its recent average and the average of the two decades before 1995. That will set the stage for a struggle in the next few years between the lingering effects of the millennial bubble and the underlying strength of the new economy.
The outcome will shape nearly every aspect of the American economy.
If the current recession turns out to be merely an average one, said Douglas M. Steenland, the president of Northwest Airlines, "then the 1990's boom warrants historic status."
"If it lasts longer than the normal downturn," he added, "the 1990's boom is likely to be just a footnote."

New York, Badly Battered but Stronger Than in the 1970's

BYLINE:  By AMY CORTESE 

 BODY:
It probably came as no surprise to most New Yorkers that the nation had officially slipped into a recession by spring, or that the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 knocked the wobbly legs out from under an already shaky economy.
 From Wall Street to Kew Gardens, the pain has been palpable. Just as nearly every resident of the city and surrounding area knew someone who lost a life in the World Trade Center, most know someone who has been directly affected by its economic aftermath -- dislocations, pay cuts, job losses. 
 That giant sucking sound? It is the gasp of collective belt-tightening across the five boroughs. Statistics confirm the anecdotes. New York City lost 44,200 jobs just in October, the New York State Labor Department said. It could lose 50,000 more by mid-2002. 
Economists and accountants have tried to tally the damage stemming from the attack, and though their figures do not always match, the costs are undeniably substantial. In addition to the physical damage and cleanup expenses estimated at $30 billion, the attacks could cost New York City some $20 billion in lost economic activity like retail sales and tourism services this year and $10 billion more next year, according to Economy.com, a research firm based in West Chester, Pa.
The $20 billion pledged by the federal government in emergency aid and billions more in insurance payments will help offset those costs, though only about half the federal assistance has actually been appropriated. A sharp falloff in tax revenue, however, will leave the state and city with yawning budget gaps not seen since the early 1990's. The city alone projects a shortfall of $1.3 billion next year and $3.6 billion in 2003.
That will keep New York's prospects dim even if the national economy emerges from recession, as economists predict it will in the second half of 2002. New York, they said, will endure a deeper and more protracted downturn than the rest of the country will feel. The gross city product, a measure of the city's economic output, declined 1.6 percent in the third quarter, compared with a 0.4 percent fall for the nation as a whole.
Some economists compare the situation in New York to that of cities hit by natural disasters, like Hurricane Andrew in 1992 or the earthquake in Kobe, Japan, in 1995. Initial slumps were followed by building booms that led revived economies, said Stephen Kagann, chief economist for Gov. George E. Pataki's office.
New York, however, will not be helped by a building boom, he said. Rebuilding the World Trade Center, as huge as such a project would be, is unlikely to have a significant impact on the economy, Mr. Kagann said. The original construction had 3,500 jobs at its peak, with maybe 1,500 more ancillary jobs created -- together, only 0.2 percent of all jobs in the region. "The city's economy is simply too large for rebuilding to be a significant boost," he said.
If New York's situation is worse than previous American disasters, it is at least brighter than the economic trough New York dug itself into in the 1970's. That fiscal crisis, with sky-high unemployment, crime and energy costs, pushed the city to the brink of bankruptcy. New York is certainly better positioned today than it was 25 years ago -- energy costs and unemployment rates are relatively low, for example, and the city is better managed.
Still, some city officials warn that the circumstances today are in many ways just as grim. Sharply lower tax revenue will require deep budget cuts, and some fear a return to high crime and fewer services.
New York's economy is more diversified today than it was in the 1970's, when manufacturing accounted for 18 percent of jobs. But it still relies heavily on financial services -- banks, brokerage firms and insurers generate 24 percent of New York City's economic output and 14 percent of the city's tax revenue, according to the New York City Partnership, a business group.
More than 11 percent of the city's jobs in October were in financial services. That is down from a peak of 14 percent in 1987, according to Economy.com, but because those jobs pay so well, financial services accounted for almost 30 percent of all income in the metropolitan area in 1999, the latest data available. From 1992 to 2000, Wall Street alone was responsible for 39 percent of the growth in business and personal income tax for the city.
"What happens in financial services largely determines what happens to the New York economy," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Economy.com.
What is happening in financial services is not encouraging. With stock markets plunging and public offerings drying up, bonuses for Wall Street professionals are expected to be down as much as 60 percent from record levels last year. Many financial firms had announced layoffs even before the terrorist attacks, but Sept. 11, said Mr. Zandi, "opened the floodgates." In October alone, the industry shed 24,800 jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
New York's other big employers -- retailers, travel and tourism companies and business services like publishing -- have also been hurt. The $34 billion travel and tourism industry could lose $7 billion to $13 billion in revenue by the end of 2003 and eliminate 25,000 jobs this year, according to the New York City Partnership.
Hotel occupancy rates fell from 80 percent before the attacks to as low as 30 percent after Sept. 11, said Economy.com, though they have since recovered somewhat. New York City retailers could lose $4 billion to $5 billion in sales in the 12 months after the attack, the partnership said.
Even with a speedy recovery for the national economy and a swift end to the war in Afghanistan, the New York City Independent Budget Office expects the city's economic growth to decline 0.6 percent this year and 1.8 percent in 2002. A slow national recovery and a prolonged war could lead the local economy to shrink 0.8 percent this year and as much as 5 percent in 2002.
Over the long term, the biggest issue facing the city is persuading businesses to stay in New York. Transportation disruptions and added security made the city, which had already ranked No. 1 nationally in relative business costs, even more expensive.
City officials -- led by Michael R. Bloomberg, who will succeed Rudolph W. Giuliani as mayor next month -- have told federal officials that their aid is needed quickly to begin restoring transportation services and rebuilding Lower Manhattan to entice companies to stay.
"It's not like we're going to turn into Tombstone, Ariz., overnight," said Lawrence J. White, professor of economics at the Stern School of Business at New York University. "But if New York is perceived as a riskier and costlier place to do business, that is going to have an effect."

Insurers' Outlook (Unexpectedly) Good, Despite Big Claims

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
This has been a terrible year for the commercial insurance business. Yet the insurers say it is hard to remember a time when prospects looked better.
 Prices for coverage are soaring and are likely to keep rising in 2002. After that, many insurance executives say, prices may stay on a high plateau for several years with what the industry regards as healthy annual increases of 10 to 15 percent. 
 The terrorist attacks on Sept. 11 were the crowning blow for the insurers -- and the major impetus for higher prices. Earlier, a string of small, but costly storms had cut earnings for the first half of 2001 by 75 percent from a year earlier, and the drops in the stock and bond markets had chopped $18 billion out of the insurers' investment portfolios. The terrorist attacks were the single largest disaster they had ever endured, with costs estimated at $50 billion and climbing.
Already, two small insurers -- one in Japan, the other in Denmark -- have failed under the financial burden of the attacks. More bankruptcies are expected.
Despite the heavy losses, the insurers say they can pay the claims stemming from Sept. 11, and most expect earnings to rise sharply. As in previous insurance disasters, this one, by all indications, is going to have a silver, if not golden, lining.
"The opportunity out there is tremendous," Henry C. V. Keeling, the chief executive of XL Re, an insurer based in Bermuda and a subsidiary of XL Capital, said at a recent industry conference.
The economics go like this: The industry loses a chunk of capital, reducing its ability to provide coverage just when customers are more worried than ever and want more insurance. Demand far exceeds supply, resulting in a roaring seller's market.
"A simple way of saying it is that adversity breeds opportunity," said Rod Fox, the chief executive of Benfield Blanch, an insurance brokerage firm in Dallas that is part of the Benfield Group of Britain. "That's probably a little too crass. But that's the way capital looks at it."
Individual investors can share the wealth through stocks. Analysts say the best bets are powerhouses like the American International Group and Berkshire Hathaway, Warren E. Buffett's investment vehicle.
Nothing, of course, is certain. More terrorism or a natural catastrophe could hammer the insurers again, though they have appealed to Washington for help in reducing losses if there are new attacks.
The insurers are nearing the end of their heaviest policy-renewal season. Prices are running five or six times the level of a year earlier for some lines of coverage, like worker's compensation, liability or protection against lawsuits and property coverage for skyscrapers in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles that are considered prime terrorist targets. Renewals through the next year are expected to come at the same, if not higher costs. Eventually, prices on insurance for cars and homes -- which were already rising -- are expected to reflect the impact of the terrorist attacks.
Insurers say that customers seem to be accepting the higher premiums.
"You get a big incident, and it increases people's fear; it increases the value of insurance," said Stephen J. O. Catlin, the chairman of the Catlin Underwriting Agencies Ltd., which is part of the Western International Financial Group and manages two insurance businesses, or syndicates, at Lloyd's of London. "People want to buy insurance now, and they are prepared to pay for it. A corporation goes 10 years without a loss, and they start asking, 'Why do we need to buy insurance?' "
That question, the insurers say, is not coming up now.
The last big surge in insurance prices came after Hurricane Andrew tore through southern Florida in 1992 in the previously worst insurance disaster, with losses of nearly $20 billion in today's dollars. Then the companies that profited were mainly home insurers, not commercial insurers.
Customers may be tolerant of an industry recouping losses from a tragedy. But if prices stay high, as they did after Hurricane Andrew and as insurers hope they do now, big profits can begin to look like gravy.
J. Robert Hunter, the director of insurance for the Consumer Federation of America, has protested to state insurance regulators that many of the latest price increases are unjustified. Both he and Senator Bill Nelson, a former insurance regulator in Florida, have urged the regulators to monitor commercial insurance prices closely. But a committee of regulators responded by voting in early December to relax controls.
The insurers' response to the criticism is that they need to make up for a lot of lost profits. After more than a decade of cut-throat pricing, they say, commercial insurance coverage now costs 60 percent less than it did in 1990. During the price war, which began fading away a little more than a year ago, the insurers' annual return on equity averaged 8.1 percent, or nearly five percentage points less than the rest of corporate America, said Robert P. Hartwig, the chief economist at the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group in New York.
Since the attacks, the insurers have not only raised prices, but they have also been rewriting policies to take back some of the features they dispensed to woo customers in the lenient years.
For example, it became commonplace for insurers to write what Mr. Catlin in London referred to as "holy cow" coverage, broadly encompassing "whatever might happen."
A corporation with perhaps 20 plants around the country, would buy, say, $50 million worth of coverage that could be applied to losses at any of the plants from a fire, an explosion with heavy casualties or a big lawsuit. The insurers simply closed their eyes to the likelihood that the plants represented vastly different levels of risk. Now, Mr. Catlin said, the coverage for each of the plants and for each of the kinds of coverage is being priced separately and at considerably higher cost.
The industry looks so attractive these days that new money is pouring in, both to start new insurance companies and to expand existing operations. Analysts expect $25 billion to be raised by the end of the year. The industry's fear is that this new money will shift supply and demand back in favor of the customer, creating, once again, a buyer's market, driving down prices.
But Ronald W. Frank, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, said he did not expect that to happen soon. The money raised so far, he said, is not nearly enough to offset the losses from Sept. 11 and the increased demand. Moreover, he said, he expects the new investors to insist on a high return and not be willing to accept bargain prices.
Those founding the new companies agree. "Return on equity for the first couple of years is going to be astounding," said Andrew J. Barile, an insurance consultant from Rancho Santa Fe, Calif., who helped start one of the companies.

Chip Makers See a Speedy Recovery; Others Have Doubts

BYLINE:  By CHRIS GAITHER 

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif. 

 BODY:
Semiconductor makers have never seen a year as bad as 2001.
 Sales plummeted an estimated 31 percent, to $141 billion, as companies and consumers bought fewer personal computers, mobile phones and other devices. The decline is almost twice as much as the next-worst year, 1985, when sales fell 17 percent because of slumping demand for the memory chips that dominated the market then. 
 The pain now is especially acute because chip makers were among the biggest beneficiaries of the boom in telecommunications and the Internet in 2000, when sales soared 37 percent, to $204 billion. 
With the economy slowing, businesses still smarting from excess capacity and consumer confidence at the lowest point in seven years, recovery seems distant. Many analysts forecast that 2002 will be flat at best, and may even see another decline in sales if consumers continue to refrain from buying more electronics.
Chip sales, which have grown on average by nearly 15 percent a year since the devices were first produced four decades ago, have never declined for two consecutive years. Such a slump would highlight the depth of the trough the industry has dug itself into, and bodes poorly for the electronics powered by the chips.
The industry group for chip makers contends that the downturn will end this year, however. While conceding some trouble in the first half of 2002, the group, the Semiconductor Industry Association, forecasts a rebound in the summer that will propel the industry to revenue growth of 6 percent for the entire year and 21 percent in 2003.
Driving this growth, the association said, will be reduced inventory levels; increased memory-chip prices, which have fallen as much as 90 percent this year; and a recovery in demand for personal computers and cellphones.
"At this point, I think the worst of this cycle is truly behind us," said George M. Scalise, the president of the association, based here.
Not convinced, some analysts dismiss the association's forecast as wishful thinking.
"The global economy is going to be pretty soft in the first half of next year," Mark Edelstone, a managing director with Morgan Stanley, said. He predicted that chip sales would decline 5 percent in 2002. "I think it will rebound in the second half of next year," he added.
In 2000, spurred by demand for all things Internet, chip sales soared 37 percent. The industry hired more workers, built more factories and increased production to meet demand.
But then the bottom fell out of the market in the last three months of the year -- and kept falling through 2001. As the Internet bubble burst and the economy slowed, electronics devices powered by their chips sat on shelves.
No region of the world was immune. The North and South American market fell an estimated 43 percent this year, while the decline ranged from 23 percent to 29 percent in Europe, Japan and Asia.
Japanese electronics makers like Fujitsu and NEC temporarily shut down chip plants -- as the overall industry slowed operations to about 64 percent of its capacity -- to try to save money. In the United States, Advanced Micro Devices eliminated 15 percent of its jobs and closed two plants. Intel, the world's largest chip maker, said earlier this year that it would eliminate 5,000 jobs, and recently reported that its net profit fell to $787 million in the nine months ended Sept. 29, from $8.34 billion in the period a year earlier.
Jean-Philippe Dauvin, the chief economist at STMicroelectronics, a European chip maker, called 2001 "annus horribilis -- the horrible year you really don't want to remember."
While he added that he expected the industry to stabilize in 2002, he warned that the recovery would be much slower than the industry association forecasts. Instead of growing by 6 percent, he said, chip sales will most likely be flat to down 2 percent.
But Richard K. Templeton, chief operating officer at Texas Instruments, insists the recovery has already begun. The association predicts the fourth quarter will be better than the third, with revenue growth of nearly 5 percent. That would be the first time this year that revenue rose from one quarter to the next.
But while the fourth quarter may improve over the third, sales will still be down 40 percent from the comparable period last year and off 25 percent from the first quarter of this year.
Even then, the association, which says its member companies produce 90 percent of the chips made in the United States, has a weak track record of prognostications.
In 1999, for example, coming off a year of 19 percent growth, the association predicted a 21 percent gain in 2000, to $174 billion. Sales actually grew nearly twice as fast.
Then, at the peak of the boom, in October 2000, the association predicted that the good times would continue in 2001, with sales growing 22 percent. "The industry is going to have the wind at its back for the next several years," the chairman and chief executive of Advanced Micro Devices, W. J. Sanders III, said.
The wind Mr. Sanders described turned out to be a gale, hitting the industry square in the face. Sales slumped and the forecast was $108 billion too high.
The association "does not have a good record of forecasting," said Terry Ragsdale, who follows semiconductors for Goldman, Sachs. But he quickly added, "I don't know anyone who does."

For Some Dot-Coms, There Are Real Profits

BYLINE:  By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
Meet Brad D. Greenspan and at first it seems like he's a visitor from another era -- the Internet bubble of 1999.
 He's a 28-year-old chief executive of a public Internet company, eUniverse, with tens of millions of users and big backers like Sony. 
 But listen to Mr. Greenspan, and it becomes clear that his story is far from the fairy tales that made millionaires, at least for a while, of so many recent graduates who had the good fortune to cross paths with venture capitalists at just the right moment. 
Since its founding in 1999, eUniverse has scraped by with barely enough cash to keep the lights on. While the bigger sites tried to emulate prime-time television, with quality programming and big brand advertisers, eUniverse resembles late night fare on the more obscure channels. Aimed at women aged 25 to 54, its network of sites are cheap, corny, crass and profitable. Its advertisers are more likely to sell debt refinancing and online diets than cars or perfume.
But the network of sites has become the 15th-biggest service on the Internet, with 18 million visitors in November, according to Nielsen/NetRatings, which researches Internet traffic patterns. And while it is a small business -- with only $6.7 million in revenue in the quarter ended Sept. 30 -- it actually makes a profit.
EUniverse is a prime example of a new species of Internet companies that are thriving even in the harsh climate that has killed off many of the dot-com giants of a few years ago. Indeed, this new breed emerged dodging the feet of their seemingly fearsome rivals. As a result, they are small, scrappy, able to live on the leanest diet and willing to do whatever it takes to survive.
"We made it work in the mean streets without venture capital funding," Mr. Greenspan said. "We have had to build and grow at a fraction of the costs that other guys are spending. And we have not been afraid to stop and change where we were going. The companies that raised all that money had to stick to their business plans."
The other Internet companies doing well have a similar low-rent strategy. Overstock.com, for example, is one of the few growing online merchants not affiliated with traditional retailers. Founded by Patrick Byrne, a former aide to Warren E. Buffett, the chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway, Overstock buys distressed inventory from failing dot-coms and other businesses that need cash and sells it from a no-frills operation in Salt Lake City. Mr. Byrne says Overstock, which is privately held, is profitable -- having become so in November -- and expects to post revenue of about $11 million in December.
Another up-and-comer is classmates.com, which charges users $29.50 a year to find old school chums. IWon.com, an Internet portal that gives users a chance to win cash prizes as they surf, is thriving and has just agreed to take over Excite.com, the once high-flying portal that was backed by the elite of Silicon Valley.
The biggest force in online commerce these days is not Amazon.com, but eBay, a flea market of individuals and small businesses who collectively sell three times as much as Amazon. And sites linked with Fingerhut, the downscale catalog merchant that is a unit of Federated Department Stores, and QVC, the shopping network subsidiary of Comcast, post far more sales than sites for big names like Wal-Mart Stores and Sears, Roebuck & Company, according to ComScore Networks.
EUniverse, in fact, now is aimed at the same moderate-income women as Fingerhut and QVC, but it did not begin that way.
As a senior at U.C.L.A. in 1997, Mr. Greenspan wanted a job at a big Wall Street firm, but he couldn't get one. So he started his own firm. What he named Palisades Capital was the telephone in his dormitory room and the fax machine at a nearby Kinko's from which he sent unsolicited pitches to raise money for companies whose filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission showed that they were low on cash.
Amazingly, several agreed, and even more amazingly, Mr. Greenspan found investors who put $60 million into four of them, including the remains of the Hayes Corporation, once a leading maker of computer modems. Mr. Greenspan walked away with $2 million in commissions, with which he decided to bootstrap himself into the Internet business.
His first move in putting together what was to become eUniverse was to buy CD Universe, a small online music store founded and largely run by one person, Charles Beilman, in Wallingford, Conn., in April 1999. He used his newfound fund-raising skills to get $6.3 million in investments from Lehman Brothers and some others.
Mr. Greenspan's strategy was to use his money and stock to buy popular sites that he could link together to sell CD's and other goods. He searched the Media Metrix ratings that measure online audiences to find mom-and-pop sites with growing popularity.
By the end of last year, Mr. Greenspan had sold the CD business back to Mr. Beilman, for $500,000 less than he paid for it, renamed the company to eUniverse, moved it to Los Angeles and focused on serving women through other small sites he had bought. The most popular is flowgo.com, which offers goofy animated e-mail greeting cards. Dancing babies, dancing animals and dancing fat people are common themes. So are illustrated versions of the sort of corny jokes that fill so many e-mail boxes, like "10 reasons why it's great to be a dog."
Other eUniverse sites, like funone.com and justsaywow.com, offer similar content with different styles. Ishaah.com, for example, offers inspirational poems and e-mail greetings with a native American theme.
"This is television," Mr. Greenspan said. "People come to get their minds off something else."
Unlike television, the eUniverse sites constantly ask users for their e-mail addresses. That's why online greeting cards are so useful. The company now has 40 million addresses, and half its revenue comes from sending e-mail advertising to them. The company boasts it sends one billion e-mails a week.
But the advertising market is soft, so Mr. Greenspan now wants to develop eUniverse's own products and services to sell to its audience. It started a venture to sell refilled printer ink cartridges and Cupid Junction, an online dating service. With lots of women, who can use the service free, eUniverse can sell memberships to men, who pay $1.60 to $3.33 for each message they send to a woman. The service now has $300,000 a month of revenue and 80 percent profit margins, Mr. Greenspan said.
Next up, eUniverse has bought exclusive online rights to distribute a home anthrax test kit. Never mind that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention runs multiple bacteria and genetic tests that take days to confirm cases of anthrax, this is exactly the sort of product that will keep the new smaller Internet companies afloat.
"It may be controversial," Mr. Greenspan said, "but the demand is there."

Tech Investors Cautiously Return, Focusing on Hardware and Biotech

BYLINE:  By MATT RICHTEL 

 BODY:
Jim Fraine, chief executive of Neocera Inc., a start-up company that makes equipment for computer chip companies, was driving to Logan International Airport in Boston when news of the terrorist attacks came over his car radio. In addition to the grief and shock he felt, Mr. Fraine took a deep breath for his personal setback; he had hoped to remember Sept. 10, not the 11th.
 The day before the hijackings, Mr. Fraine had pitched his company to venture capitalists in the Boston area to try to raise several million dollars in seed capital. When he heard the news of the attacks, Mr. Fraine said, he feared that his chance to get a positive response from the investors had gone from long shot to "hopeless -- just hopeless." 
 Mr. Fraine should hope he turns out to be a better entrepreneur than prognosticator. Within weeks, the venture capitalists made an offer to Mr. Fraine's company, based in Beltsville, Md., and at least one other group of investors is now competing to back Neocera, whose technology is used to check computer chips for design flaws.
While venture capital investment, the bread and butter of technology start-ups, is far down from the highs of the dot-com bubble, it is by no means dead. Indeed, venture capitalists and entrepreneurs point to a number of types of technologies that interest them and which they may invest in during the year ahead.
Among those technologies are nanotechnology computers built using minute processors; Web services software that moves business functions onto the Internet; biotechnology; and wireless technologies. In fairness, though, it is tough to generalize about the main sectors, because there are some 700 venture capital firms nationwide, and many of them focus on different niches. What is easy to identify is what is not being widely financed: consumer-oriented Internet companies.
The billions of dollars poured during the late 1990's into companies that provide content like news and information, or into online retailers, was an anomaly for most venture capitalists. Historically, they have focused on core technologies, niche software and hardware products, which often are far less sexy than the glamorous world of Internet start-ups; the venture capital world has long backed the technologies described in the pages of Scientific American, not the fads in Teen People.
And some venture capitalists, many of whom call themselves science geeks but who have a gift for marketing, say they are quite happy to be going back to being boring. Indeed, just hearing them talk about the latest technologies is enough to put an insomniac into a deep slumber.
"One of the holy grails is a tunable optical laser," said Sean Foote, a partner at Labrador Ventures, a venture firm based in Palo Alto, Calif., sounding like an 8-year-old describing the advent of the Nickelodeon cable channel.
Simply put, Mr. Foote said, if optical lasers were tunable, meaning they could be programmed to send different colors of light down fiber optic networks, then a single laser could replace many individually programmed lasers, reducing costs for network operators and users. In addition, Mr. Foote said, he is looking at other technologies that could cut the costs of building networks, including figuring out how to wire homes with high-speed networks and with wireless Internet access.
"Security is a huge area," he added. "Antivirus protection, intrusion detection -- look at the things in a chief information officer's purchase list, and security is the last thing" to be eliminated.
Labrador Ventures invested in a security start-up called Green Border Technologies Inc. last May, an investment that underscores a second trend in the industry. While Labrador is seeking new investments, it has not put money into a new venture since Green Border. The slowdown may continue through 2002.
According to the National Venture Capital Association, an industry trade and research group based in Arlington, Va., venture capital firms in the United States invested $7.72 billion during the third quarter of 2001, a 73 percent decline from the period a year earlier. Further, 81 percent of the investment in the third quarter of 2001 was made as follow-up financing of existing portfolio companies, indicating how tough it is for start-ups to attract venture capital dollars.
Among those companies that have attracted funds is ReefEdge Inc. of Fort Lee, N.J., which makes software to secure and manage wireless networks, like wireless Internet access for offices. Ethan D. Ayer, a senior associate for Allegra Partners, the New York venture capitalist firm that backed ReefEdge in August, said wireless technology would attract attention from investors in 2002. "It's not a question whether wireless networks will take off," he said, "it's a question of who the winner will be."
His firm, too, remains interested in the broad category called Web services, a phrase that may well become a catchall to describe many companies that receive venture financing in 2002, according to the investors. Others call it "metaware" and refer to it as the next stage in the evolution of software. At the heart of the wide-ranging category is the idea that business functions can be moved onto the Internet, and away from both proprietary networks and proprietary hardware systems, like automated teller machines.
Some venture capitalists say they are looking at technology that would let a company send updates to software across different operating systems, devices and computers. Rather than updating all servers and computers individually, they could do it once, and send it across an entire system.
There continue to be hardware investments too, as is the case with Neocera, Mr. Fraine's company. Founded in 1989, the 35-person company uses magnetic resonance imaging, commonly known as M.R.I., to look for shorts in integrated circuits. The company's device, which looks like a microscope, would be used by makers of semiconductors to see if there are flaws in newly designed microprocessors.
Mr. Fraine said the technology, already used by some chip makers, could save companies one to four weeks in detecting flaws. "Time measured to market can be hundreds of thousands of dollars a day," he said. For some popular, name-brand chips, like the Pentium, "it can be measured in millions of dollars an hour."
Mr. Fraine declined to say which venture capital firms had offered to back his company. But Labrador Ventures, which also has offices in New York, has said it is considering making an offer to become one of the company's backers.
Discussing such technologies, Mr. Foote of Labrador Ventures said, "It's not real sexy, except the part where they make a lot of money."

Advertising Industry Becomes Ensnarled In the Perfect Storm

BYLINE:  By STUART ELLIOTT 

 BODY:
For Madison Avenue, the last 12 months brought the perfect storm -- a rare alignment of perfectly awful events from the dot-com meltdown to the economic slowdown to the weeklong shutdown of most advertising after Sept. 11. The result is what may be the largest reversal of fortune for the American advertising and media industries as a big gain in ad spending in one year swings to a big decline the next.
 Ad spending will probably decline again next year, but not so much as in 2001. 
 "There are agencies in trouble, no question about it," said O. Burtch Drake, president and chief executive at the American Association of Advertising Agencies in New York, the industry trade organization, but "the indications are that perhaps the worst is behind us."
"By the third quarter of 2002, we should start to see a pickup," he added, that would generate "fairly modest growth." 
After a record year in 2000, when ad spending rose a robust 9.6 percent, to $243.7 billion, ad spending this year is expected to fall by 6 percent to 7 percent, according to an average of estimates from a dozen analysts. That would represent the first downturn since 1991, a recession year, when ad spending fell 1.2 percent from 1990. It would also be the biggest decline since a Depression year, 1938, when ad spending fell 8.1 percent from 1937.
If ad spending declines in 2002 after falling this year, it would mean the first two consecutive down years since the Depression, when ad spending fell for four years, 1930-33, according to a leading industry forecaster, Robert J. Coen of Universal McCann in New York, part of the McCann-Erickson World Group division of the Interpublic Group of Companies.
Mr. Coen, senior vice president and forecasting director at Universal McCann, predicts that Madison Avenue will avert that fate, albeit barely; after ad spending falls 4.1 percent this year from 2000, he estimated, it will start "the gradual crawl back" and rise 2.4 percent in 2002 over 2001.
Certainly neither Mr. Coen nor his counterparts' forecasts amount to a depression for 2002. But now that economists have officially declared that a recession began in March, the significant toll on the advertising and media realms is becoming apparent.
People say it's not possible for ad spending to fall in both 2001 and 2002 "because it's hardly ever happened," said Michael J. Beebe, an analyst who follows advertising and media for Goldman, Sachs in New York. "I don't care about history; the world is different."
"I think you'll see a return to normalcy in 2003," Mr. Beebe said. He estimates ad spending will fall 4 percent in 2002 after dropping 9 percent this year. "I'm more willing to believe there will be a healthier economy in '03 than in '02," he added.
So far, the cutbacks in ad spending have meant layoffs at many agencies; closings of shops like Dweck, Favara & Raffle Advertising, Pagano Schenck & Kay and Warwick Baker O'Neill; shrinking budgets at broadcast and cable television networks for news coverage and for developing new series; and reductions in editorial budgets at magazines and newspapers. There have also been forced closings of publications as disparate as Expedia Travels, Lingua Franca and Mademoiselle.
"The number of media outlets has expanded exponentially" during the recent boom years, said Lauren Rich Fine, an analyst for Merrill Lynch in New York who follows industries including advertising and newspapers, "and the excesses masked all the supply being added."
Now that the glut is becoming apparent, "there's a herd mentality" among marketers, she added, who are proclaiming, " 'I know media is cheap, but there's a ton of it out there, so I don't have to act.' "
"At what point does corporate America decide it needs to stimulate the consumer?" Ms. Fine asked. "Everyone wants to believe things will improve, but people are trying to hold onto their ad budgets and won't spend until they see it."
That delayed decision-making is described by analysts like Joe Mandese, editor of Media Buyer's Daily, a newsletter published by the Media Central division of Primedia, as "just-in-time media buying," invoking the process by which automakers and other manufacturers wait until the last moment to have parts delivered.
"This very, very short-term, close-to-the-vest planning," Mr. Mandese said, "means you can't predict" advertisers' spending intentions. "It's bizarre."
Most of the predictions that are being made do not call for ad spending to revive until the third or fourth quarter of 2002.
"No one can tell you the first half looks good," said Michael J. Russell Jr., an analyst who follows advertising and broadcasting for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in New York. "But the worse things get in 2001, the better it looks for the second half of 2002." That is because there would be easier comparisons with this year's results. Mr. Russell forecasts a 9 percent decline in ad spending for 2001 and no growth in 2002.
"That puts us on the more positive side of the coin," he said, laughing ruefully, "which is a sign of the times."
The main reason 2002 is expected to be another disappointing year for advertising and media is the continued softness in important categories in which marketers once spent freely, like travel, retail, telecommunications and consumer electronics.
"I'm not seeing any real, positive indications for an upturn next year," said Jack Myers, chief economist at Myers in New York, which publishes media and research newsletters. His forecast for 2002 is for a decline in ad spending of 5.7 percent from 2001, which he estimates will record a fall of 6.8 percent from 2000.
"If we get through the rest of this year and the first half of 2002 without another significant domestic terrorist attack, travel would come back, which would be helpful for radio and newspapers," Mr. Myers said. "But television and magazines would continue to struggle."
Indeed, the Television Bureau of Advertising in New York, the trade association for local TV stations, has reduced its own forecasts. Revenue for commercials bought on local stations in 2001 will fall 15 percent to 17 percent from 2000, the bureau now estimates, compared with a previously forecast decline of 9 percent to 11 percent. Next year, local stations' revenue will increase only 2.5 percent to 5.5 percent, according to the revised forecast, down from a previous estimate of 5 to 7 percent.
"I'm an optimist by nature," said Chris Rohrs, president at the bureau, "but we've widened the range and lowered it a little bit, just to be prudent."
"The two big uncertainties that steer us that way are: How will the war go? And what about terrorism?" he added. "If the war and antiterror efforts go well, the downturn could become an upturn sooner rather than later."
Though the trade organization for the magazine industry, the Magazine Publishers of America, does not make predictions, its leaders say they are cautious. Magazines are grappling with the uncertainties generated by the anthrax scare, the war and the fight against terrorism.
"There may be more magazines that close this year than in a normal year because it's really tough times," said Nina B. Link, president and chief executive at the organization in New York.
"But there are also new launches as well as existing magazines reaching more readers," she added. "We will ride this out."
Ellen Oppenheim, executive vice president and chief marketing officer at the organization, is touring the country to explain a research study conducted on its behalf by Media Marketing Assessment.
The study concludes that brands spending a higher percentage of their marketing budget on advertising -- in various media outlets, not just in magazines -- can get a higher return on overall marketing investment than brands that shift ad dollars to other ways to woo consumers like promotions in stores or coupons.
"The forces at play this year are different from the forces at play in previous downturns," Ms. Oppenheim said. "Media and media associations must act on those challenges and be better positioned to come out of the downturn."
As fast as the downturn took place, so, too, could an upturn.
Advertisers that "get spooked to get out for fear of getting burned will get spooked to get back in for fear of getting left behind," said Alan J. Gottesman, an analyst at West End Communications/Consulting in New York. "As soon as they think they can sell more stuff again by stepping up spending, they will."

In Japan,a Lack of Political Will To Act Decisively on the Economy

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
Only a decade ago, Americans were telling pollsters that they feared that the Japanese economic juggernaut would one day wipe out their jobs. But somewhere on the road to No. 1 status, Japan took a disastrous turn. After Japanese government bonds were downgraded to the bottom of the industrialized world, American writers started calling Japan "Asia's Italy."
 Weak political leadership, weak control over government finances and huge corporate debts, problems that have plagued Italy, are modern Japan's main challenges as the rest of the world wonders whether the country, home of the second-largest economy in the world, will be a help or hindrance in confronting a global recession. 
 But all indicators point to Japan's ailing for several years to come. The Japanese government and the International Monetary Fund forecast that Japan's economy will shrink this year and next. The fund forecasts that the economy will shrink next year by 1.3 percent, dragging global growth down to 2.4 percent.
Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi has proposed sweeping reforms, from having banks write off billions of dollars in bad loans to letting weak companies fail, but is being stymied by traditionalists in his own party, the Liberal Democrats, who want to use his reformist image to perpetuate their own power. If Mr. Koizumi cannot right the economy, which has been slumping for a decade, there is no likely savior in the wings, economists say.
"The worst scenario is the most likely: that Koizumi stays in power for the next two years and accomplishes next to nothing," said Gerald L. Curtis, a visiting political science professor from Columbia University who has followed Japanese politics for over three decades.
The hole in Japan's government finances is easy to understand. Tax receipts this year will be 16 percent lower than they were in 1990, while this year's government expenditures will be 29 percent higher. After a decade of trying to spend its way out of recession and near-recession, Japan starts the new year with public debt at 130 percent of its gross domestic product, by far the highest among the major industrial nations.
About 95 percent of this debt is held by Japanese investors at rock-bottom interest rates, and since late November, three ratings agencies, Fitch IBCA, Moody's and Standard & Poor's, have downgraded Japanese government debt ratings to AA, the level of Italy. 
Giving little credence to government vows to control spending, Fitch forecast that Japan's indebtedness would exceed 150 percent of G.D.P. by the end of 2002 and could approach 200 percent by 2007, barring strong government intervention.
"Koizumi is very committed to reforms," Brian Coulton, a Fitch analyst, said. "But there is still an element of denial about how bad the problems are among the political community."
Mr. Koizumi's standing as a reformer was badly dented toward the end of the year when the government ignored self-imposed limits on public borrowing and enacted highway and medical spending bills that austerity advocates criticized as excessive.
But with no other reformer on the horizon, the Japanese cling to Mr. Koizumi. Almost 80 percent of the public approves of his job performance, according to recent polls.
Foreign investors are less sanguine.
"Japan is a hopeless case," Jim O'Neill, a Goldman, Sachs strategist, said last month in London in a speech that reflected increasingly harsh foreign views of Japan's short-term prospects.
About the economy itself, many Japanese seem almost as gloomy.
With unemployment creeping up to 5.4 percent, the highest rate since World War II, a late November poll of 1,791 Japanese adults found 87 percent saying that they worried about their job security and 94 percent pessimistic about the economy, according to Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading business daily. 
More than one million Japanese lost their jobs this year because of bankruptcies or restructurings, and the number of plant closings is jumping. So far this year, 46 factories in the electronics and information sector have closed, up from only two last year. As Chinese imports eat into Japanese manufacturing, factory job offers here are down by a third from last year's levels.
"Every economic measure you can look at -- disposable income, G.D.P., household spending, deflation -- are all bad," said Mark Fields, president of Mazda Motor, in which Ford Motor owns a controlling stake. "The only way Japan looks good is if you turn the charts upside down."
Nihon Keizai Shimbun surveyed 1,790 of Japan's largest publicly listed companies and calculated that net profits will be down 74 percent for the year that ends in March.
"I have talked to several important business leaders and they are scared," said Robert F. Grondine, a longtime lawyer here who steps down this month as president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan. "They don't see the bottom."
Japanese executives, traumatized by real estate and stock collapses that began around 1990, are devoted to reducing debt, not borrowing for future expansion.
"You have shell-shocked executives saying they will never borrow again," Richard C. Koo, senior economist for Nomura Research Institute, recently said. "But with all companies minimizing debt, you have an invisible hand pushing toward depression."
Many of Japan's problems are self-induced. A chummy financial system, where banks served as cash conduits to affiliated conglomerates, has bad corporate debts of almost $2 trillion, according to Goldman, Sachs. The kind of big American bankruptcies seen this fall -- including Polaroid, Bethlehem Steel and Enron -- are rare here.
In recent weeks, Japan's four largest banking groups set aside $44 billion to cover bad loans. Their combined earnings of $366 million last year are forecast to plummet this year into losses of $20 billion.
Japan's long-suffering taxpayers, having seen few bankers lose their jobs and none go to jail after a major bank bailout in 1997, are expected to resist a new rescue.
Telegraphing a lack of confidence in some banks, Japanese savers are quietly moving out of time deposits into more liquid savings, according to Bank of Japan statistics.
"By March, there's a danger Japan's economy could face a major crash, if no reforms are pushed through," Yukio Hatoyama, an opposition politician, said.

South Korea Slips Away From Changes Imposed in Bailout

BYLINE:  By DON KIRK 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea 

 BODY:
Four years after a $58 billion bailout put together by the International Monetary Fund, South Korean executives and bureaucrats appear determined to reverse many of the reforms imposed upon them in the rescue of the debt-ridden economy. While the economy remains the world's 13th largest, the danger exists of reversion to some of the bad habits of the decade before the financial crisis.
 "A great deal of economic and financial reform has been accomplished," the United States ambassador to South Korea, Thomas C. Hubbard, said, but "there have been some signs of backtracking and less-than-transparent business practices." 
 Jang Ha Sung, a finance professor at Korea University, complained that "there's still no brake on the chaebol," using the word for any conglomerate with more than $1 billion or so in assets, generally dominated by the founder or his heirs. 
Mr. Jang, who has been crusading for years for the rights of small investors, and other would-be reformers who turn up regularly at shareholder meetings every spring have had little real impact on chaebol policy other than to persuade some of them to appoint a few more outside directors.
Confirming the sense that the more things change, the more they stay the same, the Korea Institute of Finance, a government research center, said that the top four chaebol, comprising the Samsung, SK, LG and Hyundai groups, despite a pledge to streamline operations, devoted only 17.5 percent of their investments to their core companies.
But the finance and economy ministry shares no sense of dismay -- far from it. Byeon Yang Ho, director general of the ministry's financial policy bureau, said, "We would like to eliminate the arm-twisting type of regulations and introduce market-friendly regulations in their place."
The finance ministry, he said, is "on the same side as the Federation of Korean Industries," a sort of club of chieftains of the chaebol. "We want to reduce controls as much as possible."
Companies worth less than $4 billion face no constraints on investment other than the limits of their bank accounts and the willingness of creditors to extend credit.
Mr. Byeon acknowledged, however, that the Fair Trade Commission, which issued some of the first warnings about the overweening power of the highly leveraged chaebol years before the economic crisis of 1997-98, "is a little more reluctant."
In the years of nonstop expansion of the conglomerates, the commission offered a dissenting voice amid all the cheers for chaebol growth, trying to encourage fiscal discipline and more competition. Much the same outlook prevails at the commission today.
Because of the commission's reluctance, the 17 largest chaebol, those with assets of more than $4 billion each, are still restricted in investing more than 25 percent of their assets in other companies or groups. Before going over that level they must show they are uniquely qualified in the same fields as the companies they want to buy, or prove that a target company is in dire straits.
Mr. Byeon contends that watchful officials as well as shareholder-rights groups would prevent the chaebol from circumventing the rules.
But there are signs of backsliding on restraints intended to keep the conglomerates from reverting to the excesses that pushed the country to the brink of financial collapse. For example, bureaucrats and executives now tend to overlook the requirement imposed three years ago as President Kim Dae Jung sought to rein in the chaebol, that every company cut its debt-to-equity ratio to no more than 2 to 1. At the time, ratios were typically 4 or 5 to 1 -- and in some cases much higher.
The government is also lifting another critical constraint, that large companies could not own controlling stakes of banks, lest they turn banks into their private treasure chests, as they had done before the economic crisis.
Now, as long as a financial company devotes 75 percent of its assets to finance, it will be able to buy 10 percent of a bank, enough in most cases to influence policy. Government officials say other companies in the group could not tell the finance company what to do, but critics disagree.
The People's Solidarity for Participatory Democracy, for example, a group led by Mr. Jang, the advocate for minority shareholder rights, implored the government to stop loosening regulations.
The move to lift the investment ceiling of the conglomerates, Mr. Jang's group said, "illustrates the government's intent to slow the chaebol reforms." The investment cap, it said, was "the core part in the nation's corporate restructuring that should be maintained."
In another sign of trouble, the Institute of Finance found that the 30 leading chaebol had put 41 percent of their equity investments into enterprises that lost money.
Lee Dong Gull, the author of the report, said the figures showed that the chaebol "have struggled to maintain their fleet-style group structures, though they repeatedly vowed to streamline their far-flung businesses in accordance with the government's reform policy."
To be sure, the corporate landscape is changing in a cosmetic sense.
The Hyundai Group, once the largest chaebol, has fragmented. The most successful new company may be the Hyundai automotive group, including Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors, which Hyundai acquired in 1998 as Kia came apart with a debt-to-equity ratio of at least 12 to 1.
In contrast to the motor group's success, other once-great companies remain in constant turmoil. The creditor institutions that now control Hynix Semiconductor, formerly Hyundai Electronics Industries, for example, are struggling with whether to lend it billions more or let it slide into bankruptcy, and the Institute of Finance study holds that the Hynix case is just the tip of an iceberg that could yet sink the chaebol system.
Foreign analysts are constantly surprised to discover that companies that they had assumed had faded into oblivion still exist in the hands of creditors. The Daewoo Group, which collapsed in mid-1999, is an example. Far less visible than Daewoo Motors, now under bankruptcy protection while General Motors negotiates to take it over, are a dozen other Daewoo companies in fields as diverse as telecommunications, construction and shipbuilding.
All are more or less for sale, but as long as no one is willing to pay the price, the creditors' institutions that took them over prefer to keep them going.

Globalization Marches On, as U.S. Eases Up on the Reins

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
To hear Eastman Kodak tell it -- and many other multinationals -- globalization marches inexorably forward. Neither incessant protests, nor worldwide recession nor the war on terrorism stops it.
 Kodak's overseas sales, after all, generate more than half its annual revenue, and the percentage is rising. The company has factories in Britain, France, Brazil, Mexico, Canada, India, China and Japan. Cameras and film flow constantly across borders, at a cost of $200 million a year in tariffs. And now, despite the anger and turmoil surrounding the issue, the nations of the world have agreed to negotiate yet another round of tariff-cutting. 
 "The globalization debate has changed, but the underlying reality has not," said Christopher A. Padilla, Kodak's director of international trade relations. "Reducing tariffs means you can reduce artificial costs, and that means you can sell more overseas." 
That same focus shows up in the Bush administration. Getting the 142 member nations in the World Trade Organization to agree in Doha, Qatar, last month to another round of negotiations to lower trade barriers required significant compromises by the administration. Mention them to Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, however, and he insists on calling them "solutions," not compromises.
But they were compromises. Globalization is gradually slipping from the control of the United States and the other industrial nations. The developing countries are gaining ground in a few battles. The protests that started in Seattle in 1999, the third world poverty made worse by recession, the ravages of AIDS in Africa, the anti-American sentiment stirred up in the war against terrorism, the sudden pressure to turn critics into wartime allies -- all were felt in Doha, and the agreement that emerged was harder for Washington to savor.
"There are some things that are irritating in the Doha agreement," Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill acknowledged, "but we are going to have another round of trade negotiations. That is what really matters."
Constant tariff reduction is only one aspect of globalization, which has come to mean not only the increasingly unrestricted flow of merchandise across borders, but also the free flow of money, people and all sorts of services. Bankers, lawyers, brokers, insurance companies and investment firms routinely operate from offices in a dozen countries. Merchandise trade, which once meant making a product in one country and exporting it to another, now means making a product in phases in several countries.
A Kodak instant camera sold today in France may have been assembled and packaged in that country, but the camera mechanism came from a Kodak factory in China, and its film from the United States. Cameras, and many other products, are no longer even made in America, which helps explain why Kodak and other powerful companies struggle to influence the rule-making that governs the globalization of their activities -- and to bring as many countries as possible into the World Trade Organization and thus commit them to the rules. China and Taiwan are the newest members, having formally joined at Doha.
The last set of rules, adopted as a result of the Uruguay Round, began to take effect in 1995, with the W.T.O as the supervising body. A new round of rule-making was to have been authorized at a W.T.O meeting in Seattle in 1999, but violent protests broke up that gathering.
Two years later, the Doha agreement finally set the guidelines for negotiating new globalization rules that would be ratified by 2005 -- and the House of Representatives approved a bill this month that would give President Bush more authority in negotiating the rules. The Senate has not yet acted.
"After the failure in Seattle, many of us felt that failure at Doha would have put the W.T.O. at serious risk," Mr. Zoellick said. Sept. 11 only raised the stakes.
A failure at Doha would have undermined the American effort to build a coalition in the war against terrorism, said Prof. Dani Rodrik, an international economist at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, "and the United States exerted an enormous effort to accommodate the less developed countries."
So ground has been given. The Doha guidelines, for example, water down patent protection for brand-name drugs by giving poor countries the right, in emergencies, to license inexpensive generic versions. That is a big concession to AIDS-ravaged Africa, although Mr. Zoellick shuns the word. He talks not of concessions but of turning problems into opportunities and of making globalization "fit with coalition building."
Similarly, the antidumping rules that now protect America's steel and lumber industries from lower-priced imports are likely to become less protective, although in the horse-trading this month to win House passage of the bill that would give the president more authority in trade negotiations, the administration rescinded, in effect, some concessions made on steel and textiles. There is also recognition in the Doha guidelines that the less-developed countries are often at a disadvantage in trading with the developed nations, and therefore need special treatment.
Beyond the Doha accord, globalization is gradually being altered in other ways. It is also shrinking as a percentage of global economic activity. The worldwide recession has reduced nearly every country's exports, and also curtailed the flow of foreign loans and foreign investment from the industrial to the less-developed countries. The shrinkage is almost certain to be temporary, disappearing when recovery kicks in. But the changes in response to the anti-globalization protests and the pressures of Sept. 11 are likely to be permanent.
"What is happening now," said Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr., president of the Economic Strategy Institute, a research group in Washington, "is a recognition that the global marketplace, left to itself, is not going to automatically produce wealth and prosperity in less-developed countries unless there is rule-making and new structures that reduce the potential for destructiveness."
In a speech last month, Anne O. Krueger, the Stanford University economist who was named second in command at the International Monetary Fund in June, unexpectedly proposed just such a new structure. Nothing had drawn more outcry against globalization in the late 1990's than the practices of the Clinton administration and the I.M.F. in dealing with the Asian financial crisis. Foreign capital had flowed freely into the Asian tiger countries. Then, when their economies got into trouble, and the foreign lenders fled with their money, the Clinton administration and the I.M.F. made matters worse, the critics charged, by insisting that the suffering countries raise interest rates.
The administration and the I.M.F. thought that when the return on the risky loans rose, the foreign lenders would keep their money in place. But the foreign money disappeared anyway, and the higher rates discouraged economic activity, thus pushing the countries into recession and greater unemployment. Meanwhile, multibillion-dollar emergency loans, mostly from the I.M.F, meant in effect that the countries in crisis suddenly had the wherewithal to repay the foreign lenders, who seemed to come away whole.
Addressing this dynamic, Ms. Krueger, in her speech, proposed the creation of an international bankruptcy mechanism that would require foreign lenders to keep their money in place while debtors and creditors worked out an orderly repayment plan. A bankruptcy mechanism would make foreign lenders more cautious, Ms. Krueger said, by convincing them "that the official sector is not waiting on the sidelines to bail them out when things go wrong."
The surprise proposal drew support from two persistent critics of I.M.F. practices during the Clinton years -- the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and Prof. Jeffrey D. Sachs, an economist at Harvard and the director of its Center for International Development. "It is an attempt to do something other than push official money into these crises," Professor Sachs said. "I am pleased, and also surprised; globalization has its downsides and one has been unrestricted capital flow."
The economic theory that justifies globalization is also increasingly debated these days. The Bush administration and many mainstream economists hold that economic growth and a rising standard of living come to any country that lowers its tariffs, opens its borders and welcomes foreign capital without rules governing its movement in or out of the country. Foreign competition forces a country to modernize its economy, become more efficient and concentrate on what it produces best, the administration says. As exports rise so does a nation's output and employment.
Applying that dynamic to the United States, Mr. Zoellick has argued "that one-quarter of our economic growth in the 1990's was generated by exports." The North American Free Trade Agreement and the Uruguay Round "have boosted the annual income and lowered the cost of purchases for an average American family of four by $1,300 to $2,000 a year," he has said. These figures assume, however, that all of the tariff reductions and adjustments in the trade agreements occurred instantaneously, even though the agreements themselves permit them to occur over a period of years. A worker in an apparel factory, for example, who loses his job because of low-priced imports, finds another job right away in electronics or some other industry.
"International trade theory," said Thea Lee, a trade expert at the A.F.L.-C.I.O., "assumes that we live in a world where everyone who loses a job is immediately re-employed in a better-paying job, and every dollar of exports is balanced by a dollar of imports. It does not happen."
Professor Rodrik, the international economist, raises another issue. He agrees that free and rising trade does raise living standards over the long run. The short run is another matter. While Mr. Zoellick points to Korea and China as countries that have benefited from trade, Professor Rodrik says they protected their industries until they were strong enough to compete in the global market. "China was and until very recently remained one of the most closed countries in the world in terms of a trade regime," he said.
For Kodak, with its powerful brand name, globalization works. Efficiency rises and costs decline as Kodak spreads manufacturing and marketing around the globe. Employment alone has fallen below 80,000 worldwide from 94,800 in 1996, and 53 percent of the company's $14 billion in annual revenue now comes outside the United States.
"That is why the Doha agreement is so welcomed around the world," Mr. Padilla said, "and certainly by Kodak."

HEADLINE: South Korea Expects Its Economy to Grow 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Dec. 16 

 BODY:
While much of the world hunkers down to weather a recession, South Korean officials see fairly bright near-term prospects for their own economy, assuming conditions do not get much worse in the United States or Japan.
 Jin Myun, the minister of finance and economy, said last week that he expected growth in 2002 in excess of 4 percent -- not exactly roaring by Korean standards, but much more robust than any of the big industrial economies now hopes for. 
 He also predicts that his government will make significant headway next year in cleaning up a morass of money-losing companies on government financial life support. 
The Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry has predicted hefty increases in exports by carmakers, chipmakers and other manufacturers.
Confidence in the economy rests on the outcomes of long-running dramas surrounding the crumbling of two empires, Hyundai and Daewoo. General Motors has nearly completed a deal to take over most of the bankrupt Daewoo Motor Company. AIG, the American insurance group active in Asia, is working to gain control of three financial companies once part of the Hyundai empire.

HEADLINE: To Help Land, Australians Rethink Role Of Kangaroos 

BYLINE:  By JOHN SHAW 

DATELINE: SYDNEY, Australia, Dec. 16 

 BODY:
"Throw another roo rib on the barbie" may lack the sales appeal of the grilled-shrimp slogan that Australia once used to attract American tourists.
 But harvesting Australia's 25 million-strong kangaroo population to sell the meat around the world is a central element in a new land care strategy being promoted here by scientists, ranchers, environmentalists and government officials. 
 The kangaroo, unique to Australia, is among the world's most numerous large mammals, a pest in some areas that competes with cattle and sheep for grasslands, and, for some, a low-fat delicacy. 
Despite the kangaroo's symbolic status, about two million are killed each year to control the population, and most of those end up as pet food. The kangaroo's value and treatment are now the subjects of renewed debate here.
Advocates of kangaroo ranching differ on the specifics, but agree that it has a place among a variety of long-term actions needed to halt chronic soil degradation and diversify sources of farm incomes.
They urge making the prolific kangaroo an export product as a way to jump-start economic and conservation reforms in arid rangelands.
Animal welfare activists here and in the United States argue that mass harvesting could lead to the extinction of several major species.
But although vast numbers of kangaroos are killed each year by professional shooters and on the nation's roads, kangaroos still outnumber the human population of 19.3 million.
The main lobbying groups on rural issues, the National Farmers Federation and the Australian Conservation Foundation, are warning of "an alarming crisis in degradation of the productivity and environmental value of rural landscapes."
Citing "a long history of inappropriate land use," the groups called, in a recent report, for "changes in rural economies" to enable 15 percent of all agricultural output to come from "environmentally accredited" land within 10 years.
That would require public and private investment of about $30 billion to protect and repair threatened and damaged soil, water and vegetation resources. It would also require a change of heart and habit among beef and wool producers, as well as most of the nation's political leaders.
In last month's national election, in which Prime Minister John Howard and his conservative government won a third term, the major parties did not address the erosion, salinization and acidity already degrading an estimated five million acres.
Michael Archer, an American-trained biologist who is the director of the Australian Museum here, is raising money for a research and advocacy program of "land experiment" called the Future of Australia's Threatened Ecosystems.
Professor Archer called for a new "economic strategy to reduce dependence on conventional livestock, increase sustainable kangaroo harvesting, and double protected zones to about 20 percent of all land."
Around the township of Wentworth, 500 miles west of Sydney, 16 sheep and cattle ranchers who work 800,000 acres recently decided to rotate herds and encourage the growth of resilient native grasses.
Annabel Walsh, a rancher whose family has 10,000 sheep on 60,000 acres, says they have to shoot 1,200 kangaroos each year. "Pressure on the land is our problem," she said. "There has been overgrazing for a century. But solutions have to be ground-up from local people, not top-down from city experts."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: HOLIDAY; 
Fast Ends in Kabul, But a Hunger Grows For a New, Better Life

BYLINE:  By AMY WALDMAN 

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan, Dec. 16 

 BODY:
The rollicking call-and-response of gunfire that echoed throughout this city on Saturday night was meant to celebrate the end of Ramadan and the arrival of Eid al-Fitr. But the exuberant fusillades seemed to signify more than the endurance of 30 days of fasting dawn to dusk.
 Afghans had emerged, battered but unbowed, from yet another war, one of many in their brutal history. With apparently unintentional irony, the settling in of peace here was celebrated with the sounds of war. 
 Eid, which Muslims throughout the world began observing today, is a time for visiting family, making peace with enemies, and of course eating. In Afghanistan, where the three-day observance of Eid came sandwiched between the fall of the Taliban and the inauguration of a new government, it was also a time for personal celebrations of change and hope.
The bazaar on Saturday pulsed with the ebullience of pre-Eid shoppers. "We are freer now the Taliban cannot inflict cruelty anymore," said Mirza Khan, a 45-year-old shopkeeper from Kandahar.
The hugs exchanged at the mosque after prayers this morning carried a special warmth. Everywhere were reminders of small freedoms restored -- a dandy strutting about in new, Western-style trousers he could not have worn a year ago; a woman at the bazaar lifting her burka off her face to get a better look at a pile of secondhand clothes.
But like a flashlight sending its beam into the darkness, Eid also cast a cold light on how many lives here had been broken by war and poverty. The expectations of Eid -- new clothes for the family, cookies, nuts and sweets to offer visiting relatives -- stretched thin the wallets and ingenuity of the army of jobless here. It was painfully easy today to tell the comfortable children, in bright new clothes, from the poor.
On Friday, Habibullah, a government employee who has not been paid in four months, lined up for the third day in a row to try to get some wheat so that his four children could eat during Eid. On Saturday, Mr. Khan, whose carpentry shop in Kandahar, and thus his livelihood, had been damaged by American bombs, bought a meager amount of cookies from Ghulam Rasoul Faizi, a former professor who had been fired by the Taliban.
Nafisa Mahmoudi, whose husband was fired by the pre-Taliban government of President Burhannudin Rabbani, picked through a bin of secondhand clothes looking for one "new" thing she could bring her five daughters. Anisgul, a widow unable to outfit her children in new clothes, bought socks for her daughter, a hat for her son and a packet of sweets for visiting relatives. Mari, married to an unemployed mechanic, bargained for shoes with money her 13-year-old son, Rohullah, had made baking cookies for Eid.
This morning, women and sooty children gathered in a line well-ordered by soldiers outside the Wazir Akbhar Khan Mosque, waiting to beg from the men who had gone inside to pray. When a man produced a bill, they clawed over one another trying to reach it, then rearranged themselves and their burkas as if sitting for a portrait.
At her home, a Kabul resident named Saleha set out a tray of dried peas and raisins and a plate of cookies -- all she could afford -- poured some weak tea and talked about the darkness of the last half-decade. For the fifth straight Eid, since they were fired by the Taliban from a government education office, she and her husband were without jobs. She had managed to find some work cleaning and doing laundry. Her husband, 60, had slowly lost his mind and his health.
"My life is one of sadness," she said, at 34 looking more like her husband's daughter than his wife. From her window, she could see a hill where American bombs had landed.
But for the first time in years, she at least had hope. "This is the first Eid we have had happiness," she said. "We are the most optimistic we have been."
It was a theme echoed at least among the most destitute: things could change only for the better. For now, Mr. Khan, the carpenter and cookie buyer, said, "it does not matter that I do not have money." He was enjoying his freedom, and waiting for Western aid to change his life.
This morning, for the first time in several years, thousands of men exercised their freedom of choice about where to worship. The Taliban had tried to force everyone to go to the main mosque.
This year, it was sparsely attended, as men fanned out to mosques around the city. At one, the Wazir Akbhar Khan Mosque, a cleric exercised his right to free expression.
Last year, clerics-in-training had come to speak in Arabic, although almost no one understood them. This year, the cleric spoke bluntly about Afghanistan's hopes and its vulnerabilities. He called on government ministers abroad to return home and bring their educated children, and money, with them. If they only came seeking power, he said, those at the mosque should pray that they would be killed on the way.
It was a serious note on a day of fun. Children crowded onto ramshackle wooden playground equipment. Families crowded into parks.
Children and adults played a game of cracking two hard-boiled eggs against each other. The one whose egg cracked had to give it up. The game had been banned by the Taliban, who said it was gambling.
With almost every shop in the city closed, the streets were virtually empty. The balloon sellers, however, were out -- their peddling part of the eternal struggle here to stay financially afloat, their wares aloft like the newly untethered spirits of Kabul.

HEADLINE: Back in Her Truck, Reno Jump-Starts Her Campaign 

BYLINE:  By DANA CANEDY

DATELINE: MIAMI, Dec. 16 

 BODY:
It was a different crowd than the one Janet Reno faced when she wiggled her hips and pumped her fists on "Saturday Night Live" in January, but she drew chuckles just the same when she did a similar dance in a campaign appearance at a retirement community in Boca Raton last week.
 Ms. Reno has, in fact, been doing the unexpected since she started her campaign for governor from the back porch of her house in September. Though she suspended much of her campaign in the weeks after the terrorist attacks, Ms. Reno is plowing ahead once again, raising money, hiring a campaign manager and making the case for why she should replace Jeb Bush, the president's brother, in Tallahassee. 
 From the start, it has been an unorthodox campaign, which seems to suit the Clinton-administration attorney general just fine. When, for example, a potential voter asked Ms. Reno during a recent appearance if it would be O.K. to call her at home to ask a few questions, Ms. Reno ripped a deposit slip with her phone number on it from her checkbook and handed it to the woman. And shortly after Ms. Reno announced her candidacy, one of her fans, the talk show host and actress Rosie O'Donnell, called to offer her support. Ms. O'Donnell is giving a $250-a-plate fund-raiser for Ms. Reno in Miami this month.
But whether Ms. Reno's celebrity and folksy campaign style will translate into votes is hotly debated in restaurants, centers for the elderly and political circles here. After Sept. 11, a race that was expected to be driven to a large extent by voters' already strong views about the two high-profile candidates is even more likely to center on issues like states' roles in national security and on Florida's economy.
"I would say the state budget and economy and how it affects things like education may end up at the top of the list," said Jim Kane, director of the Florida Voter Poll, a political news and polling service.
Since the terrorist attacks, Florida's economy has been hit hard by a steep decline in tourism. Weeks after the attacks, the Fort Lauderdale-based Renaissance Cruises announced it was going out of business. Then the ANC Rental Corporation, the parent of the Alamo and National car rental companies, which is also in Fort Lauderdale, filed for bankruptcy protection. 
Walt Disney World, meanwhile, has reduced employee hours at some attractions. At the same time, the state faced such a severe budget crisis that legislators held a special session in which they made cuts in a wide range of programs, including education and social services.
"We know from past experiences that governors tend to get beaten in elections when the economy is doing bad," Mr. Kane said. "But one thing Reno seems weakest on is the budget and economy. She tends to speak on children and the elderly, but she needs policy advice on how to deal with Florida's economy crisis. Otherwise, she will lose credibility." 
Ms. Reno, 63, a former Florida attorney general, has just hired a campaign manager, who says she will lay out her agenda in the coming months. "It's clearly a long road ahead, and it's going to be a challenging race, but we feel very good about where things are, and we're going to have a lot of fun over the next year getting her message out," said Mo Elleithee, the campaign manager, who most recently worked as communications director for Governor-elect Mark Warner of Virginia.
Mr. Elleithee's job will most likely include keeping up with his candidate, who likes to travel alone to campaign appearances in her pickup truck. She is planning a "red truck tour" from the Alabama border through the entire state, where she says she believes she can sway voters who have not yet heard from her.
Whether Ms. Reno's down-home approach is a reflection of her personal style or a deliberate strategy created by public relations advisers like the local Vodicka Quintero Group is unclear. 
Some political observers say, however, that some aspects of her strategy are fashioned after the everyman style that worked so well for the late Gov. Lawton Chiles. Mr. Chiles, who died in 1998, earned the nickname Walkin' Lawton when he took a 91-day walking tour of the state from the Alabama line to Key Largo in 1970.
"She is a very down-to-earth woman, and that is exactly the way Lawton Chiles was; to some extent, there is a similarity there," said Barbara Corwin, who was a close adviser of Mr. Chiles for 23 years. "I don't know with her being a female that she could carry the good-old-boy laid-back attitude that Lawton had. Women have to carry a higher profile in the political arena."
So far, Ms. Reno's approach seems to have caught on in some sections of the state. She has been met by packed audiences in heavily Democratic South Florida, where people call her refreshing, earnest, cool. But she is likely to be a tough if not impossible sell in the staunchly Republican Panhandle, if diners at the Coffee Cup Restaurant in Pensacola are any indication.
"I just couldn't vote for Reno," said Suzanne Peele, 56, who works part time for a trauma intervention program. "She seems like a principled person with good values, but I don't believe she has the leadership qualities that are needed. She didn't show enough independence from the president, and the Justice Department should stand apart from the executive branch."
The sense of Ms. Reno in South Florida could hardly be more different. At her appearance at a community for the elderly in Boca Raton on Thursday, 500 retirees pushed walkers and fold-up chairs to squeeze into an event intended for 250 people. 
"She has the knowledge, she has the determination, she has the ability," said Isabella Fink, 84. Besides, Ms. Fink said, "She just envelops the audience. It's just plain love that people have for her." 
Even though other well-known Democratic contenders dropped out after she entered the race, Ms. Reno knows the challenges that lie ahead if she wins the primary next fall. People still question her about Elian Gonzalez and her affliction with Parkinson's disease and associate her with Bill Clinton's misdeeds. On top of that, she is running against an incumbent who is the brother of a president leading the nation in war.
As a result she has to choose her words carefully. 
"I wish for this country and for the president of the United States success in bringing the terrorists to justice," Ms. Reno said in an interview. "I wish that it be done consistent with our Constitution and our laws and that it be done without infringing on our freedom, and if the president of the United State can do that, more power to him. And if Jeb uses his coattails, more power to him, but I will still be talking about the issues that are important to the people of the state of Florida."

Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about Janet Reno's campaign for the governorship of Florida misstated the office she held before becoming attorney general of the United States in 1993. She was state attorney for Dade County, Fla., not state attorney general.

HEADLINE: Reforming Elections, a Year Later 

 BODY:
Washington indirectly took notice of a painful anniversary last week. A year after the Supreme Court intervened to bring the 2000 presidential election to its messy conclusion, the House of Representatives passed a bill to overhaul the nation's flawed voting process. A key group of senators from both parties agreed the next day to embrace a stronger measure that is expected to be voted on in January. The President should ultimately sign a bill that more closely resembles the Senate's approach to ensure that the federal government adequately protects the integrity of national elections. 
 Most Americans assumed Congress would fix such a glaring problem, one so basic to the health of our democracy, without tarrying so long. That it took a year to come this far is due to the clashing partisan agendas that invariably intrude on election matters -- with Democrats eager to make it easier to vote, and Republicans harder to commit fraud -- and to the extreme deference still paid to states' rights, even when not owed. 
 The House bill that passed by a resounding vote of 362 to 63 establishes goals for states to meet in improving their election procedures and provides them with $2.65 billion to do so, including $400 million for jurisdictions to replace their infamous punch-card systems. Having the federal government underwrite elections to this degree is unprecedented. It is also timely. Elections have never ranked high on most states' spending priorities, and current economic conditions have depleted state treasuries.
Regrettably, the House bill stops short of imposing some meaningful mandates on states. For too many of the bill's laudable goals, states are granted great discretion in deciding how, or whether, to meet them. This is true when it comes to making polls accessible to voters with disabilities, affording voters a chance to correct a miscast ballot and granting voters the right to a provisional ballot when they do not appear on precinct lists. 
Most alarming, states would still not be forced to meet a uniform, national standard for error rates in elections. Americans surely do not expect that a costly federal overhaul of elections could still result in a patchwork system, with states offering varying degrees of reliability. In a national election, ballots in one state should not face a significantly higher probability of not getting counted than ballots in another.
By contrast, the Senate bill would impose more stringent mandates. States would be required to offer provisional ballots and make computerized voter lists accessible in polling places by the 2004 election. Technology that enables voters to correct undervotes (ballots with no candidate selected) and overvotes (more than one candidate) would be required by the 2006 midterm elections. That deadline should be moved up.
The bill includes some sensible federal mandates aimed at reducing fraud. These include requiring ID checks for first-time voters who did not register in person. Making it easier to vote and harder to cheat now becomes the Senate's bipartisan cause. Once the Senate bill passes, President Bush and House leaders ought to embrace it as well. Americans want national elections to be governed by a strong set of uniform standards, and they want the changes made soon.

HEADLINE: New Jersey's High Rollers 

 BODY:
It should not come as a surprise that New Jersey's outgoing Legislature has indulged in a last-minute spending spree. As any political force cedes power -- in this case the state's Republicans, who turn over the Trenton statehouse to Democrats in a few weeks -- there is often a frantic, last-chance aspect to the final days in office. In New Jersey, lawmakers are piling the sides of pork so high that the scene has begun to look like slapstick comedy. 
 Governor-elect James McGreevey, a Democrat who replaces Donald DiFrancesco, a Republican, has pleaded with outgoing legislators, including members of his own party, to freeze state funds. He argues that New Jersey is facing a deficit of $1.9 billion, a financial hole that starts his term with very few pleasant options. But making Mr. McGreevey's life easy is not on the Legislature's priority list. Instead, every pet project is having its day: one would increase pension benefits for retiring legislators, a special favor to a well-heeled Democrat who switched to the Republican Party just when it needed him most. Another favor would lower the tax on cigars -- apparently still a staple in some political quarters. Legislators are considering money for dredging, dams, new driver's licenses and historical site restoration -- all courtesy of the very politicians who boast that they are the state's fiscal conservatives. 
 Two important proposals are also dangerously high on the wish list of some members of the Trenton crowd. One is a plan to revive the flagging town of Camden. The other would authorize all kinds of expensive extras in the name of creating the Newark Arena. Camden and Newark need help, but with more artful plans that promote urban development with something other than state spending.
Mr. McGreevey, who believes he has scuttled these plans for now, has talked about a targeted Camden revival plan that is similar to plans pushed by former Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania. That would be an improvement on the State Senate's $180 million bill, which throws money at everything in the town. In the wake of Sept. 11, the revival of Camden must be done cautiously. The legislative proposal for a downtown arena in Newark also threatens to turn into a $1 billion pork feast that deserves to die of its own weight or be trimmed to something that spares the state all but the most minimal support.
Governing in the next few years will be difficult enough for Mr. McGreevey and the next Legislature. If the outgoing legislators spend all their money, the incoming crowd will have to raise taxes or cut local funds, requiring local communities to raise property taxes. Those options could still become necessary if revenues are as bad as Mr. McGreevey predicts, but at this point, New Jersey's legislators should be careful not to squander what little they still have.

HEADLINE: Competition Fierce for Stake in New York Gambling Market 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

 BODY:
From urban vacant lots on New York's western edge to swatches of grassland and woods on the southern flank of the Catskill Mountains, and in corporate boardrooms from Rochester to Reno, a quiet gold rush is under way.
 When Gov. George E. Pataki and the Legislature acted in October to create the biggest expansion of legalized gambling in the state's history, the obvious winners were Indian tribes and racetracks. The tribes secured approval for as many as six casinos, and the tracks won the right to install video gambling machines, little different from slot machines. 
 But the new law will also create another set of major victors, if it survives the expected legal challenges: the companies that win contracts to build and operate casinos, and supply them with gambling equipment. 
The companies, ranging from billion-dollar corporations to local entrepreneurs hoping that lightning will strike, have been buying property, hiring architects, romancing tribal and government officials and investing in lobbyists and campaign contributions. Some entered this competition years ago, others more recently, and all have stepped up their efforts in the last few months.
To the gambling industry, the October law represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity, the opening of a vast New York market that has been closed to legal gambling beyond horse races and the state lottery.
If the new law survives court battles, and the proposed casinos win state and federal approvals, that new market will produce revenues of $3 billion to $4 billion a year, industry officials and analysts predict.
"We are not talking about a drop in the bucket here," said G. Thomas Baker, chief executive of International Game Technology, or I.G.T., the world's largest maker of gambling machines. "This is a significant market."
Harrah's, the world's second-largest casino company, is one of several companies that have made a proposal to the Seneca Nation of Indians, hoping the tribe will choose them to build and run as many as three casinos in western New York. Harrah's says it has also discussed a Catskills casino with another tribe -- it will not say which one -- and scouted locations, armed with a feasibility study it conducted on the region several years ago.
Such casinos in New York would take some business away from Atlantic City, doubling the resolve of casino companies there to get a piece of the action in New York.
"If someone's going to cannibalize us, I want to be the cannibal," said Philip G. Satre, chief executive of Harrah's, which has two Atlantic City casinos. He said his company was talking with the Senecas "long before the bill was passed."
Park Place Entertainment, the world's largest casino company, has a development deal with the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe for a casino at Kutsher's Country Club, outside of Monticello in the Catskills, a resort that Park Place has an option to buy. That project is further along than any other in New York, and construction could begin as early as next year.
The Delaware North Companies of Buffalo is another bidder to build and run casinos for the Senecas, who have taken proposals from several companies. Like many of its competitors, Delaware North has bought up potential casino sites in Buffalo and Niagara Falls, and possibly elsewhere, and commissioned mock-ups to show tribal officials. And like its competitors, it guards that information jealously, refusing to disclose those locations or show the models to reporters.
Delaware North, a $1.3-billion-a-year conglomerate, is a national leader in food service at sports stadiums and airports. It owns eight horse or dog racing tracks and operates resort hotels. Its chairman, Jeremy M. Jacobs, owns the Fleet Center in Boston and the Bruins professional hockey team that plays its home games there.
The company has ventured into the gambling field, with its racetracks and video gambling machines at one track in West Virginia, but it has never run a casino.
"We've got a long history in New York, and we think that makes a difference," said Louis M. Jacobs, executive vice president of Delaware North.
Other local companies, large and small, with no gambling experience at all, are also vying for a role. Probably the largest is Flaum Management, a Rochester-based real estate company. Flaum has bought three vacant lots as possible casino sites, in and around the Catskills town of Mamakating, near Route 17 in Sullivan County.
"We started accumulating land five years ago in anticipation that something might happen," said David M. Flaum, chairman and chief executive. "This is a really big opportunity for us. We're speaking to several tribes. I can't tell you which ones, but because we have this great land, we're getting a lot of phone calls."
As for his company's lack of experience in gambling, he said, "Casino management is not rocket science."
Several real estate developers and speculators have bought Catskills property in recent years, saying that they have no immediate plans to be casino operators but merely hope to cash in on the economic boom they expect casinos to bring to the region. Most prominent among them is Louis R. Cappelli, a Westchester County developer with close ties to the Pataki administration, who has bought the Concord and Grossinger's, two of the Catskills' largest resorts.
In the last decade, more than 200 Indian casinos have sprung up across the country, including two in upstate New York, run by the Mohawks and the Oneida Nation. Most Indian casinos are modest affairs, far from urban areas, and the tribes usually operate the casinos themselves, hiring a few outsiders to help. Only a few tribes -- generally those with the biggest operations -- have hired companies like Harrah's or Sun International to run their casinos.
"The closer you are to a population center, the better off you are, and the more those arrangements with outside management make sense," said Richard Schiff, deputy chief of staff of the National Indian Gaming Commission, a federal agency.
New York tribes have signaled that they plan to go with companies that can supply expertise and large-scale capital investment.
The new gambling law allows for three Seneca casinos in western New York, and three in the Catskills. The tribes that would get the Catskills casinos are not specified, but it is widely assumed that one would go to the Mohawks, and other tribes have expressed interest in getting into the business.
The National Indian Gaming Commission, which must approve management contracts, generally limits them to five years and caps the management company's take at 30 percent of revenues. Several tribes have used that five-year period to learn casino management, and then taken over the operations.
Jason N. Ader, a gambling industry analyst at Bear Stearns, said the likeliest corporate winner in the New York rush is International Game Technology, of Reno, Nev., which controls more than 70 percent of the slot machine market.
"No matter who gets the deal to manage the facilities," he said, "they have to have the games, and the equipment companies are going to have a windfall."
If all the planned projects come to pass, New York would have 12,000 to 20,000 slot and slot-type machines at casinos and racetracks. (The machines at the tracks would technically be part of the state lottery system, though they would not be all that distinguishable from the machines in casinos.)
To put that into perspective, the two Connecticut casinos have fewer than 9,000, while Atlantic City has 36,000. Those machines sell for about $10,000 apiece, so the initial sales could reach $200 million, and slots are typically replaced every five to seven years.
Gambling machine makers have been quietly lobbying casino operators who might get into the New York market -- and, to some extent, the tribes themselves -- in hopes of winning contracts.
"Trust me, we're in contact with every possible casino operator," said a top executive of one gambling machine maker.
Mr. Baker of I.G.T. said, "Our people are in touch back there," but he would not elaborate.
New York is drawing such intense interest because of its enormous, largely untapped markets. New Yorkers who are determined to play casino-style games already have myriad options -- a train ride to Atlantic City, a bus trip to Connecticut -- but this is something else entirely.
The new law points to a future in which casino-style gambling would be an easy, even casual part of everyday life for millions of New Yorkers, with video lottery terminals at tracks like Aqueduct in Queens, Yonkers Raceway and several upstate tracks; a full-fledged casino in downtown Buffalo and another in downtown Niagara Falls; and as many as three casinos in the Catskills, barely an hour's drive from New York City.
The two Connecticut casinos, Foxwoods and the Mohegan Sun, are widely regarded as the most successful in the world, with estimated combined revenues (they do not make actual figures public) of $1.9 billion a year. Their success has been attributed to having a vast New England market to themselves.
More than seven million people live within 100 miles of the Connecticut casinos, according to a Bear Stearns analysis. For casinos in Sullivan County, that figure would be about 19 million people within 100 or so miles.
"When you put a casino near a large population base, the market grows significantly," said Mr. Satre of Harrah's.
In other words, when gambling suddenly becomes convenient, many people who did not gamble before will start, and those who already gambled will gamble more.

HEADLINE: The Strength That Is New York 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 "Out of Many, New York," by Mario Vargas Llosa (Op-Ed, Dec. 11), hypothesizes that New York's wondrous diversity catalyzes the hatred of our fanatical enemies. Missing, however, from the author's examples is the dichotomy between the very rich and the very poor -- and the regrettable fact that the wealthy do so little to uplift the needy. 
 We must explore why so many of the world's dispossessed are disappointed by America. Except in high-profile disaster relief missions, our nation, which often describes itself as motivated by religious charity, has done next to nothing to bring the poor of the world into the orbit of economic self-sufficiency. None of this excuses Sept. 11, but it is food for thought as the United States rethinks its agendas, domestic and foreign.

HEADLINE: As Welfare Comes to an End, So Do the Jobs 

BYLINE:  By NINA BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
The subway cars on the W line snake from Queens through the heart of Manhattan and on to Brooklyn, collecting dirt and debris from thousands of riders. At the end of the line, on an elevated platform in sight of Coney Island's Ferris wheel, a dozen people in green vests sweep, scrape and swab the grime away.
 Transit-system employees doing the same tasks on a neighboring platform earn from $11 to $19 an hour, with union benefits. But the "green vests" are not working for pay. Like 300 other people cleaning subway cars and stations for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, they are recruits from New York City's workfare program -- by far the largest in the nation -- laboring in exchange for a welfare grant and the hope of being hired. 
 Daisy Torres, a 34-year-old mother of three who was raised on welfare, gets a subway car's floor so clean that her supervisor swears you could eat off it. James Howard, 42, a 10th grade dropout who did odd jobs off the books to supplement his family's public assistance grant in years past, had almost perfect attendance. 
They were striving to join the 122 subway car cleaners who had gone on to permanent jobs with the authority, out of hundreds who began the program. But after many assurances that they were on a list to be hired, Ms. Torres and Mr. Howard were among dozens who got a double dose of bad news last month. Because of the deepening recession, the authority had imposed a hiring freeze. And, under federal law, the city's Human Resources Administration informed them, their welfare benefits were at an end.
They and the other "green vests," recruited over the past 18 months, are only a few among the thousands who have participated in the Work Experience Program that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani made the centerpiece of his welfare overhaul. But their circumstances illustrate both Mr. Giuliani's extraordinary success in reshaping the city's safety net around work, and the new pitfalls, even for those who have followed the rules, as time limits and bad times converge.
In states from New Hampshire to Hawaii, the first welfare families are reaching the five-year federal limit just as the economy slumps. But New York City has by far the largest number of people working for their benefits, and nowhere else are so many of them reaching the cutoff at the same time.
Although state law has spread a safety net of sorts for those losing federal benefits, some may already be falling through it. 
In a welfare office in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, where signs declare "Your Clock is Ticking," and "Make an Effort, Not an Excuse," Mr. Howard veered between fatalism and anger. "I made lots of efforts," he said. "Working out there, freezing, wearing three pairs of socks and two coats, just to get the job. And now they won't even give me a chance." 
Ms. Torres, fingering a stack of "outstanding" job evaluations and scary welfare notices in the family's one-bedroom Brooklyn apartment, clung to hope. "My struggle and my goal is all about my kids," she said, eyeing Guillermo, 12, Elisa, 8, and Giovanni, 6, as Christmas lights twinkled from the fire escape.
Its champions say that workfare, which evolved under the commissioner of the Human Resources Administration, Jason A. Turner, into an elaborate mix of work assignments, job training and job searches, has been a way for welfare recipients to give back to the city and a path to real jobs for many.
Its critics contend that it has been a dead end for many poor people in need of education and training, a way to cut and divert people from public benefits and create a tide of cheap labor that has swept thousands of paying jobs from city payrolls. 
The authority's program provides evidence for both arguments. Hailed as a national model when it was announced in 1996, it started two years ago in a more modest version. Of 9,509 people sent to the subways on workfare since December 1999, the authority said, 4,400 showed up, and 301 have been hired, 122 of them as subway car cleaners. The authority's director of labor relations, Gary Dellaverson, said that hiring record compared favorably with those of other workfare sites in the city.
"I'm proud of the project," said Mr. Dellaverson, who negotiated it in collective bargaining with the transit workers' union six years ago.
Gabriella Bello, a single mother of four with little knowledge of English and less education, is an example of how well the authority's workfare program turned out for some. After many years on welfare and four months of cleaning subway cars at the 179th Street terminal in Queens in exchange for her family's grant -- at a cost to the city of about $1.80 an hour -- Ms. Bello was hired in October of last year. Her hourly union wage rose to $13 this month, and she also receives the full $200 in monthly child-support paid by the younger children's father, rather than the $50 that the city passes through to mothers on welfare whose grants average $594 a month. 
"I feel free," said Ms. Bello, who left school in the Dominican Republic at 9 to work as a housekeeper for her mother. "I feel happy because I work to get my money."
But many of those assigned to the subways by the city had the worst of work and welfare. New leadership of Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union Local 100 faults its predecessors for agreeing to a workfare program that a local vice president, Neil Persaud, said leaves welfare recipients without a paycheck and under constant threat that their benefits will be cut off -- "at the mercy of the boss," Mr. Persaud said. In his zeal to be hired, Mr. Howard, for example, became the Coney Island terminal's designated cleaner. He was called to dispose of bodily waste in subway cars, to heave garbage from the dank station below the tracks, to scour an employee bathroom that he was not allowed to use.
"This job would do wonders for my family," he explained the day after Thanksgiving, when he still hoped he might be hired. 
Exactly what workfare recruits were told about the chance of being hired is a matter of dispute. City officials say that no promises were made, and that hiring is dependent on vacancies -- which dwindled this year as turnover slowed in a souring economy. 
But in spring 2000, a Human Resources Administration memo to contract agencies called the subway program "an excellent opportunity" for recipients being prepared to move from welfare to work, and stated that after 90 days of successfully performing the work, "candidates who express an interest and have demonstrated initiative and a readiness to work (i.e. good attendance, punctuality, ability to follow directions, enthusiasm, etc.) will then be processed for hire" -- that is, after routine paperwork and medical exams they would be moved into union jobs starting at $30,000 a year.
Teachers at the contract agencies, where the cleaners spend two days of the work week in a supervised job search or in classes, said that as 90 days stretched into a year, vacancies were so scarce that some mothers broke down, torn by the needs of sick children, pressure for perfect attendance and looming time limits.
Mr. Dellaverson called the memo "misleading." As for five-year welfare time limits, he said, they have nothing to do with the authority.
Time limits had everything to do with the anxiety of veteran workfare cleaners at the end of the W line. 
"My time is almost up," Mr. Howard said in late November, gripping a broom with calloused hands. He looked back at the utility closet where he had eaten a bag lunch amid bottles of bleach, after cleaning the employees-only lunchroom upstairs. "I really thought I had the job," he said. "Now I don't know what's going to happen next month -- I don't want to lose my home."
During a prosperous decade, welfare policy focused so strongly on personal responsibility that the role of large economic forces and simple calamity almost disappeared from view -- until Sept. 11. Now, those seeking to make the transition face a badly weakened economy.
But hard times never really stopped for Mr. Howard. In the 1980's, he worked in factories that relocated to places where labor was cheaper. By the early 1990's, he said, he was doing whatever day jobs he found to help his disabled wife, Gaynell, raise their three children on public assistance. When she grew too ill to keep up with the new welfare demands, he became the official head of household and was responsible for fulfilling the workfare requirement. Eventually Mrs. Howard -- diabetic, blind in one eye, and with a history of psychiatric hospitalization -- qualified for a monthly $545 Supplemental Security Income check.
"If I lose my benefits, S.S.I. is the only thing that's going to cover the rent," Mr. Howard said, holding the notice that said his family had been denied transition to Safety Net, the state-financed aid for which it was still eligible when welfare benefits ended, because Mr. Howard had failed to apply in October. But at the time, his documents from the authority corroborated, he was finally being "processed for hire." 
Ms. Torres, usually a beaming presence over her sudsy mop, said she had cried in the Safety Net office, begging to be allowed to keep the subway post, since the station manager was sure she would be hired in the next round. Caseworkers told her there was nothing they could do. Instead, like several thousand of 30,000 recipients who reached the limit of welfare benefits on Dec. 2, she was offered a temporary, subsidized position as a Parks Department laborer and told that if she refused, her family would lose all aid.
To an extraordinary degree, Mr. Turner, the welfare commissioner, has succeeded in reorganizing a notoriously unmanageable bureaucracy around his work-first philosophy. City and state welfare officials point to recent studies finding that over all, the economic circumstances of poor New Yorkers improved substantially in the late 1990's, while the welfare rolls shrank to about 387,000 cases, half the 1995 peak. They insist that the transition to Safety Net went smoothly .
But on Nov. 26, when Mr. Howard went to the welfare labyrinth for help in keeping his family housed and fed, a different reality awaited. 
At the Manhattan address listed on the Safety Net letter, he was sent back to his local welfare office, the Bay Ridge Job Center. As toddlers cried and tugged at parents, the line inched forward near a poster that declared, "Winners Make the Grade; Whiners Make Excuses." One woman was in a wheelchair, another on crutches. Some clutched threats of eviction, medical bills, printouts of bureaucratic error. When his turn came, Mr. Howard was sent upstairs, to wait for his caseworker -- who could not help and sent him down to the line again . 
His wife joined him there, sent from her Supplemental Security Income office, she said, when she asked for help keeping food stamps.
"It's too late," another caseworker told them later, directing Mrs. Howard to an office in downtown Brooklyn, and giving Mr. Howard a number to call to appeal; it was constantly busy.
Later that week, on one of his last days working in the subway, Mr. Howard cleared 25 loads of trash from the station parking lot. When he paused to rest, a supervisor brusquely ordered him back to his mop.
"I'm not a slave," Mr. Howard shouted. "I'm a human being." 
Ms. Torres is hanging on. A new notice postponed her Parks Department orientation, scheduled for Nov. 29, without explanation. She does not know what Safety Net benefits, if any, will arrive this week; when she reads her daughter's Christmas list, she said, "it breaks my heart." 
But she is still cleaning subway cars under the Coney Island sea gulls, praying that the work she does can become her job.

HEADLINE: Can the Internet Be Left to the Market? 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "The Broadband Economy," by Karen Kornbluh (Op-Ed, Dec. 10): Turning the broadband Internet into a regulated public utility isn't the answer for getting high-speed Internet services to the public.
 High-speed access is already available to most American homes, even in rural areas. 
The real question is whether Americans are willing to pay for it. The price is high but reasonable -- with most services running around $50 per month. If people choose not to avail themselves of it, there is no public policy issue to discuss. 
 Ms. Kornbluh's implication that capitalism is fine but that some infrastructure projects are just too big for the private sector to pull off is simply not the case. First, the subsidies to speed up this industry would have to come from taxes paid by the private sector in the first place. And contrary to myth, even the great infrastructure companies of the past -- electricity, phone service and railroads -- experienced tremendous rivalry before governments turned them into monopoly "utilities."

To the Editor:
Karen Kornbluh ("The Broadband Economy," Op-Ed, Dec. 10) rightly points to the potential role government can play in correcting the "last mile" problem -- connecting homes and businesses to the broadband backbone. 
 The nationwide fiber-optic network is increasingly seen as a public asset. 
It is important to ensure that all have equal access to it. Telecommunications companies offer cheaper and faster service where population density is greatest and profits are the highest. Rural areas are increasingly being left behind. 
 Access to telecommunications technology is the gateway to economic development opportunities, education, health care and other essential public services. Our nation runs the risk of widening the digital divide unless the government commits to universal, public access to the broadband network.

Military Contractors Set to Begin Rare Experiment in Cooperation

BYLINE:  By LAURA M. HOLSON 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
The nation's response to the attack by suicide bombers on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in September brought with it a renewed sense of pride in the military, from the pilots who test fighter jets to the makers of radar systems and submarines.
 But for the next 12 months, analysts say, much of the industry's focus will be on Fort Worth, where Lockheed Martin, the nation's largest military contractor, will build the next-generation stealth fighter airplane, the Joint Strike Fighter. 
 If the $200 billion Joint Strike Fighter project is successful -- and it will be many years before anyone knows -- it will be the first fighter jet adapted to fit the needs both of three branches of the American military and of Britain. The United States and Britain plan to buy 3,002 planes: the Air Force, 1,763; the Marines, 609; the Navy, 480; the British Royal Air Force, 90; and the British Royal Navy, 60. 
In an important departure for the industry itself, the cooperative effort, which includes BAE Systems, the British maker of sophisticated military equipment, and Northrop Grumman, could be a template for how industry rivals work together in the future.
Usually, projects are made up of a prime contractor who manages smaller subcontractors, and, indeed, the huge project will produce work for dozens of major subcontractors and hundreds of smaller suppliers involved in the jet's development. But a big difference in this case is that BAE and Northrop are full-fledged partners commanding a combined 32 percent stake. 
"This closely knit team could take prime partners to a new level," said Howard A. Rubel, a military industry analyst at Goldman, Sachs. 
Furthermore, the project will support thousands of jobs at Lockheed, based in Bethesda, Md., and its subcontractors for decades to come. Northrop Grumman, which is based in Los Angeles, will build the central fuselage for the fighter, as well as design its radar and stealth systems, and will hire as many as 1,300 additional engineers by 2003, the company says. 
BAE is expected to hire 250 workers in the United States, as well as add to its payroll in the British Midlands, where major sub assembly will take place. Final assembly will be at Lockheed's plant in Fort Worth.
Just how binding the partnership is will be tested in coming months as lobbyists for Boeing, which lost out to Lockheed to build the fighter jet, try to maneuver the company into the project. If Lockheed succumbs to political pressure and is forced to make room for Boeing, which executives say is unlikely, the move would surely anger both BAE and Northrop. 
Charles Thomas Burbage, an executive vice president of Lockheed and director of its Joint Strike Fighter program, said Lockheed and Boeing executives would meet this month to discuss Boeing's options.
For Boeing, which recently moved its headquarters to Chicago from Seattle, the loss of the contract is only the latest blow. Boeing is facing the elimination of 30,000 jobs, and orders for commercial airplanes which were already dwindling, have declined further, it says, because of the terrorist attacks in September.
The developments have changed the fortunes of investors, as well as of jobholders and seekers. Lockheed Martin's shares, although trading below their 52-week high of $52.98, set on Oct. 29, shortly after the contract was awarded, are up 35.64 percent this year, at $46.05. Boeing shares, which tumbled after the attacks, are down 43.11 percent this year, to $37.55, and Northrop Grumman has gained 13.75 percent this year, to $94.41.
Not all the innovation in coming years will be centered on pilot-operated high-powered fighters. The industry has also trained its sights on advanced surveillance equipment, which would not only make it easier to gather military information, but also put as few lives as possible at risk.
Here Northrop Grumman clearly has an edge. The Global Hawk, an unmanned precision aircraft that can quickly gather and deliver surveillance information from 65,000 feet, is already being tested in Afghanistan. "What is emerging is a need not to do a mission just to find a target, but to track everything all the time," said Robert A. K. Mitchell, a vice president for advanced programs at Northrop. "Now you have the technology to keep track of everything."
The Pentagon plans to buy 60 Global Hawks over the next few years. And if the Global Hawk turns out to be a hit, it could spur demand for different types of unmanned vehicles, including those with commercial applications like mapping, monitoring traffic, even shipping packages for services like Federal Express. The Pentagon has even explored the idea of building a fighter jet that would operate without pilots.
"The question is: 'How comfortable do you feel with a data link and not a man in the loop?' " Mr. Rubel said. "I don't think we are there yet."

Frugal Shoppers Worry Retailers

BYLINE:  By KATHLEEN MURRAY

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass. 

 BODY:
Loaded down with six shopping bags, Debbie Mahoney looked like a typical holiday shopper as she searched for one final gift in Sears earlier this month. But appearances can be deceiving. 
 "This year is going to be real scaled back," said Ms. Mahoney, a 36-year-old mother from Arlington, Mass., noting most of the bags were from the Gap where her son worked, and she was getting a special one-day 40 percent family discount. "I'm really not doing it up like I have in past years," she said. 
 Ms. Mahoney, who manages a dry cleaning service, said she was worried about her job and uneasy about her husband's as a truck driver. In addition to clothing, she is buying practical things this year, like the bed cover she still hopes to find for her son, and she has sworn off a spree at the after-Christmas sales. "You just don't know what's going to happen, so I feel better if we keep a little money in the bank." 
Retailers are similarly wary, not knowing how long the recession will last, or how much overextended consumers will spend after the holidays.
"The spending outlook for the first half of next year is rueful," said Robert Buchanan, a retail analyst with A. G. Edwards in St. Louis, adding, "It's just as dour for the rest of the economy."
Industry sales in the critical Christmas season are expected to be flat for the first time since the 1990 recession, despite aggressive discounts and special promotions.
Even before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks dampened Americans' spirits, many retailers were slumping. Upscale merchants like Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue and Tiffany began to see a decline last year in their fortunes, along with the values of their customers' stock portfolios, leading them to reduce inventory, pare orders and cut expenses.
Also, traditional department stores have been losing market share to specialty retailers and discount stores like Wal-Mart Stores and Target for some time. "We're in a tough economic environment and proceeding accordingly," said Cathy Wright, a spokeswoman for Target, which also owns Marshall Field's and the ailing Mervyn's.
Sales and markdowns have reduced supplies on the shelves at Marshall Field's department stores, and the company predicts sales in the current quarter will be down from a year ago. Federated Department Stores, which owns Macy's and Bloomingdale's, expects sales to decline 7 percent to 10 percent in the fourth quarter. Gap, which has been perhaps the most beleaguered of all specialty apparel stores, has sharply reduced inventories for the holiday season and the first quarter of 2002. It also held its first friends-and-family event, the special-invitation sale attended by Ms. Mahoney, in an attempt to bolster business.
But analysts say the toughest challenges lie ahead, and the promotions are one reason for that. "Some retailers have been stealing business from January and February in December with these huge markdowns," Todd Slater, a retail analyst with Lazard Freres, said. "You can't do that indefinitely."
Gross profit margins at Gap, which also owns Old Navy and Banana Republic, slipped to 31 percent in 2001 from 37 percent a year earlier and 42 percent in 1999. Wal-Mart, Kohl's and Costco Wholesale have felt some squeeze as well, but their margins have declined by only a fraction of a percentage point as consumers have become more cost-conscious in a stalled economy.
After initially losing customers in the weeks following Sept. 11, sales rebounded at Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville, Ark., rising 6.7 percent over the previous year in the third quarter. H. Lee Scott Jr., Wal-Mart's chief executive, predicted annual earnings growth would return to its 15 percent target in 2002.
Kohl's, the fast-growing value retailer based in Menomonee Falls, Wis., is also an industry favorite because of its low-cost merchandising and efficient, automated inventory system. It posted sales increases of 6 percent through the third quarter at stores open at least a year, added 62 stores this year and plans to open 70 more in 2002. "Right now it's full speed ahead," David Kandel, a Kohl's spokesman, said.
Industry watchers also expect specialty stores that emphasize home and hearth to do relatively well, siphoning further business from department stores. Bed Bath and Beyond, Home Depot and some book retailers should continue to attract customers who travel less, spend less and cocoon more, Mr. Buchanan of A. G. Edwards said. Online retailing -- which is projected at $67 billion this year, up from $46 billion in 2000, according to the National Retail Federation -- could also gain as consumers shy away from malls and shopping centers.
The bleakest prospects are reserved for department stores and specialty apparel stores. Even some discount chains are struggling. 
Ames Department Stores, the nation's No. 4 discount retailer after Wal-Mart, Target and Kmart, announced this month that it would close 54 stores next year. Ames, which filed for bankruptcy protection in August, had previously closed or planned to close 63 other stores. After the latest closings, it will have 333 stores in the East and Midwest.
Sales have stalled at the former darling Abercrombie & Fitch as its latest fashions have failed to catch on with young people. Many specialty retailers are further dogged by overcapacity -- stores have been added at a rate of 10 percent a year, which might have worked in a boom economy but will not now.
Retailers who fare best in the gloomy months ahead are expected to be those that stick to the basics -- merchandising, marketing and figuring out the most cost-efficient way to do it. For example, J. C. Penney, which has floundered in recent years, posted sales increases of 5 percent in the third quarter of 2001 for stores open at least a year after revamping inventory and marketing to cut costs and lure customers.
Target, which has posted solid sales increases this year, is trying to extend its reach online. In October, the discounter agreed with Amazon.com to cross-list products on each other's Web sites. "It's all about finding win-win situations," Ms. Wright of Target said.
But the crucial challenge will remain finding customers willing to spend. Mr. Slater of Lazard Freres said that both traffic and the amount spent per sales transaction were stronger than expected at many retailers during the start of this holiday season. Also, he said, retailers may benefit as consumers who have become wary of travel and leisure pursuits use the cash meant for those activities to go shopping.
And, of course, not everyone is gloomy. At a mall in Cambridge, Mass., George Georgiev pointed to the new red velvet dress that his 4-year-old daughter was wearing. He and his wife, Boriana, bought the dress on the spur of the moment, and they were clutching shopping bags filled with more purchases. "Our situation is different than many people," he said. "My wife just went back to work, so we feel we can buy what we want this year."
Still, most economists do not expect to see signs of a recovery until the second half of next year. Many in the industry think it could be the third quarter of 2002 or later before things start improving in retail.
"We're paying for unbridled enthusiasm," Mr. Buchanan, the A. G. Edwards analyst, said. He said retailers had opened too many stores, apparel producers had built too many plants and consumers had too much debt. "It's going to take a while to get out of this."

Automakers' Big Sales Now May Cut Business Next Year

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: FARMINGTON HILLS, Mich. 

 BODY:
Car buyers have a really pleasant prob lem a great variety of vehicles from which to choose, and the choice has been made all the better by all the aggressive incentives that the Big Three rolled out to spur demand after Sept. 11.
 But what is good for consumers this year could spell pain for the industry next year. Most analysts say the post-Sept. 11 interest-free financing blitz stole buyers from 2002. That means there will be too many cars next year and not enough buyers. 
 Interest-free financing deals, started by General Motors and adopted by Ford Motor and the Chrysler Group of DaimlerChrysler, raised sales to record levels, including more than 1.7 million cars and light trucks in October, the biggest sales month on record. That was good news for the beleaguered economy, as well as for car buyers, but for the Big Three and their stockholders, it was bad news in terms of the bottom line.
Take Ford. The cost of incentives jumped to 16 percent of revenue in 2001 from 11 percent of revenue in 2000, the company's chief financial officer, I. Martin Inglis, said in October. Each percentage point increase slices away $1 billion of pretax profits, a phenomenon that contributed to Ford's first projected annual net loss since 1992 -- $880 million, or 48 cents a share, according to consensus analysts' projections compiled by Thomson Financial/First Call.
"The sales number can be hard to read, but the profits are clearly going to be under pressure," said Nicholas Lobaccaro, an analyst at Lehman Brothers. "Ford and Chrysler will suffer the most. This is just a weak time in their product cycles, and all the cost-cutting in the world probably won't get them in the black."
G.M. led the push to interest-free financing because it is in a stronger position than its rivals with a fresh lineup of sport utility vehicles and pickups and is gaining market share after years of declines. Ford and Chrysler matched the G.M. offer, grudgingly, in order to stay competitive.
Most analysts criticize using incentives to buy sales, but G.M. has its reasons. The company has about 2.5 retirees per active worker in the United States, and its market share has shrunk from about 60 percent in 1950 to about 28 percent today, making it more burdensome to pay benefits to retirees. Now G.M. must find a way to make its short-term gains in market share last.
G.M. hired Robert A. Lutz, Detroit's favorite "car guy" and the champion of the PT Cruiser, to add pizazz to its lineup. Ford brought back an eye-catching design of its Thunderbird and installed Nicholas V. Scheele, who turned around Jaguar, as chief operating officer. Chrysler has tried to put a new stamp on the S.U.V. with its Jeep Liberty. Unfortunately, Ford and Chrysler have scheduled few significant vehicle introductions, and Mr. Lutz has only just begun. Next year could be painful for the Big Three.
G.M. is expected to earn $1.85 a share next year, according to Thomson Financial/First Call consensus estimates. The current consensus for Ford is 57 cents, and analysts expect Chrysler to lose money, but not its parent, DaimlerChrysler.
While the Big Three battle over incentives, the real threat next year will continue to be foreign manufacturers, even more so in a market that most analysts expect to shrink significantly. Analysts expect the industry, which will sell about 17 million cars and light trucks this year, to sell about 15.5 million next year. American car buyers are increasingly drawn to imports, which account for more than one-third of sales. Toyota, Honda and Hyundai all gained market share through the first 11 months of 2001; G.M. kept even, and Ford and Chrysler lost share, according to Ward's AutoInfoBank.
"People who have to rely more on high volume and deals will be more subject to whims of the market," said Roy Coons, a sales manager for Volkswagen cars at the Bill Cook Automotive Group here. "It's important that people have a desire for a product as opposed to a need."
And the need is there in some people. Take William Ashford, a 56-year-old Detroit Fire Department captain who is ready to retire. He wants a silver Porsche Carrera. For almost two decades, he has had a motorized model of one in his basement. Now, he figures he might be able to afford to buy the real thing. Almost. There is still the question of insuring it.
"I live in the city of Detroit, where they charge you astronomical figures for no-name cars," he says. "What are they going to charge for this?"
Captain Ashford, a mild-mannered man, gestures toward a Carrera in the showroom of Bill Cook Imported Cars at the Bob Cook Automotive Group in this suburb of Detroit, where one street, Grand River Avenue, is crowded with dealers for many automakers, domestic and foreign.
For the car, he says, "I might move to Phoenix," where he reckons that insurance would be more affordable.
He is serious. He has asked his wife.
His father told him long ago not to buy a nice car. He didn't have a garage, or even a driveway.
"I got the driveway, I got the garage," he says. "Now, can I afford the insurance?"
Maybe in Phoenix.

HEADLINE: Deal Bolsters Satellites as Cable TV Competitors 

BYLINE:  By AMY HARMON and JENNIFER 8. LEE 

 BODY:
Move over, cable television. Vivendi Universal's purchase of a stake in EchoStar, the satellite television company, is the latest sign that the companies selling pizza-size satellite dishes have emerged as potent competitors to cable operators for delivering video programming.
 For nearly a decade, satellite companies have been slowly taking subscribers away from cable companies. They have had the greatest success in rural areas and among high-income households willing to pay several hundred dollars up front as well as high monthly fees for access to exclusive sporting events and movies. 
 But the two major American satellite services, Echostar and DirecTV, have broader ambitions. Recently they have made inroads into the densely wired suburban areas that have long been cable strongholds, garnering more than 20 percent of the total subscription television market. 
The two companies now hope to merge in an effort to create the nation's largest pay-television provider and compete with cable companies in providing such high-technology options as digital video recorders and interactive television. 
The plan gained an ally last week when Vivendi agreed to pay $1.5 billion for 10 percent of EchoStar. The deal provides EchoStar with the financial backing it needs to push forward its merger with DirecTV.
Vivendi, an upstart French media company with few choices when it comes to finding a vehicle to distribute the material it produces, will also bolster EchoStar's offerings with interactive technology and programming from its television and movie studios.
That means cable operators may have to hasten the introduction of features they have long promised, like video-on-demand. For consumers, it could mean price competition at a time when cable rates are skyrocketing. Since 1996, cable rates have increased 35 percent.
"Right now, large cable companies dictate what content gets a chance to make it in the American market," said Gene Kimmelman, co-director of the Washington office of Consumers Union. "The hope is that this will enable satellite to compete for the lunch-bucket crowd and that as a result, we'll finally see some pricing pressure on cable. "
Satellite operators still face several political and technological obstacles in their effort to dominate the cable companies. 
Attorneys general of several states have indicated that they are prepared to file lawsuits to block EchoStar's planned merger with DirecTV on antitrust grounds. 
Together, the companies would control more than 90 percent of the satellite television market, and rural communities not wired for cable have complained that the merged company would have a monopoly. 
In addition, satellite customers still have to pay a fee for dish installation, although the price has dropped to under $200 in many areas and some promotions offer a dish free. 
Moreover, satellite providers offer local programming like nightly news in only the top 40 or so markets of 210 nationwide. 
Cable operators, with direct wiring into 65 million households nationwide, are better positioned to offer high-speed Internet access. Some analysts say that the growth in satellite television may be slowing.
This year, for the first time since the industry began in 1994, satellite television attracted fewer new subscribers than the previous year.
Still, Vivendi is gambling that the EchoStar merger with DirecTV, owned by the Hughes Electronics unit of General Motors, will be approved, and that the combined company will serve as a powerful platform for its programming.
In Vivendi's recent buying spree of media companies, what has attracted the most attention are its purchase last year of Universal Studios and its agreement, expected to be announced today, to acquire the television and film units of USA Networks Inc. for about $10.7 billion. 
But some analysts say it is the smaller, decidedly less flashy EchoStar deal that may ultimately do far more to shift the balance of power among the world's media giants. 
For the first time, EchoStar, the nation's sixth-largest pay-TV provider, has a programming partner. 
EchoStar's chairman, Charles Ergen, argues that the satellite industry has been held back because the major cable firms hold stakes in many of the nation's major producers of programming. 
"One of the reasons that interactivity in the U.S. has not taken off as much as the rest of the world is that we have had a hard time getting content providers to work with us," Mr. Ergen said last week in a conference call after the Vivendi deal was announced. 
If the merger goes through, Mr. Ergen added, satellite television operators will be able to compete more effectively on price and program offerings because the larger subscription base will give it a stronger negotiating position with programming producers.
Indeed, satellite television has made more inroads internationally than it has in the United States, especially in countries like Spain and Italy that do not have extensive cable systems. 
This success in other countries may be one reason Vivendi and its chairman, Jean-Marie Messier, are willing to bet on satellite's potential in the United States. In addition to its programming, Vivendi also brings EchoStar its interactive television technology through its subsidiary Canal Plus, a leading provider of television software. The software can be found in more than 11 million set-top boxes.
In Europe, where interactive television is a year and a half ahead of the United States, Canal Plus users can gamble, shop and play games. 
Cable companies in the United States have invested billions of dollars in laying the groundwork for sophisticated interactive networks. Company executives say these investments are on the verge of paying off through video-on-demand and high-speed Internet access, areas where satellite television lags. 
"Satellite will erode market share of cable on a global basis because it is easier to implement," said Harold L. Vogel, a media analyst and author of "Entertainment Industry Economics" (Cambridge University Press, 2001). "You throw up a dish, and you've got it. "
Satellite has one distinct advantage over cable operators, its national reach. For at least the near future, most cable operators will remain geographically fragmented, with disparate systems. About 7,500 of the nation's cable operators have fewer than 3,000 subscribers. But satellite companies can market nationwide, even more so if the merger of EchoStar and DirecTV is approved.
Satellite television companies are starting aggressive sales campaigns in areas where cable is weak. They are aiming at those customers whose cable bills have increased unusually fast in the last several years, who cannot receive digital services or who feel that their cable company offers poor customer service. 
One such region appears to be the northern suburbs of New York City, where Cablevision Systems raised basic rates by 12 percent in some areas last January. 
EchoStar in particular has been aggressively offering low-end packages, like a $9-a-month package for 100 channels. 
Satellite television is generally more expensive than traditional, analog cable, with basic service costing an average of $27 a month for satellite compared with $16 for analog cable. However, digital cable is more expensive, at $49 for a basic package.
When DirecTV first came on the market in 1994, cable operators thought that satellite television would simply be a niche player. But cable operators have been forced to upgrade their systems and services to defend their territories. 
Cable operators are closely watching how Washington reacts to the planned DirecTV and EchoStar merger. 
They are leery of opposing it because, if it does not go through, Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corporation. and a formidable rival, may seek to gain control of DirecTV. Mr. Murdoch, a longtime believer in the potential of satellite, dominates the satellite market in Europe and Asia. 
Vivendi has now become the first global media firm to challenge Mr. Murdoch on that turf. 
"When you have a worldwide content powerhouse like Vivendi investing $1.5 billion in a company, that's a confirmation that satellite is competing very well against cable today," said Jim Stroud, a senior analyst with the Carmel Group, a consulting firm.

For Policy Makers, the Question Is: How Much Is Enough?

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
When it comes to engineering an economic recovery, the question now is whether policy makers have done too much, too little or just enough.
 Even before it became clear after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks that the United States had entered its 10th recession since World War II and its first in a decade, the nation had wheeled out its big policy guns. 
 The Federal Reserve started cutting interest rates back on Jan. 3, when most forecasters were predicting nothing more than a slowdown in what at the time was the longest business expansion on record. The Fed continued to ease monetary policy throughout the year, and last week it cut rates for an 11th time to cap off one of the most aggressive efforts in the central bank's history to reduce borrowing costs and restore the economy's vitality. 
By summer, President Bush and Congress had put fiscal policy to work as well, including nearly $40 billion in immediate rebate checks in the $1.35 trillion, 10-year tax cut championed by Republicans. As the year drew to a close, Congress was enmeshed in negotiations on an economic stimulus package that would provide more tax cuts and extra help for unemployed workers.
Some economists argue that the combination of monetary and fiscal policy will reignite economic growth early in the new year and set off an expansion so robust that the Fed will have to reverse course and begin raising rates by springtime.
Other analysts contend this recession will prove difficult to end, in part because businesses are still recovering from an investment boom gone bust. In their view, the economy might need more help to recover.
Or maybe Washington got it just right, and the downturn will give way to a healthy recovery by the middle of next year.
"Left to its own devices, the economy would have a very strong tendency to reaccelerate," said Kenneth T. Mayland of ClearView Economics, a consulting firm.
"Layer on top of that very expansionary monetary policy and very significant fiscal policy," he said. "Then layer on top of that the positive effects of lower energy prices. Because of all those reasons, I'm supremely confident that in relatively short order the economy will get back on a healthy growth track."
The more pessimistic analysts say that policy is packing only a limited punch in this recession, which has been characterized not by a broad-based decline in demand but by a retrenchment in business investment.
They say long-term interest rates remain relatively high, banks are less willing to lend, consumers are carrying heavy debt loads and many companies do not want to purchase more equipment no matter how low their borrowing costs.
James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Wells Capital Management, an investment firm based in San Francisco, predicted policy makers might end up considering more fiscal stimulus.
"Monetary policy alone is just not good enough any more," he said.
So far, however, the optimists seem to outnumber the pessimists, both among economists and investors.
The futures markets are betting that the Fed will begin raising rates by spring to keep inflation in check as the economy recovers. The bond market seems so convinced that a strong recovery is coming that long-term rates are right about where they were a year ago, before the magnitude of the economy's problems became clear.
Still, there is some concern among economists that the Fed could face a problem if the economy continues to deteriorate.
During 2001, the Fed cut rates by a total of 4.75 percentage points, leaving its target for the benchmark federal funds rate, the interest charged on overnight loans among banks, at 1.75 percent. Should the recession resist the policy medicine dispensed so far -- or should the economy suffer a fresh shock, like another terrorist attack -- the Fed would be limited in its response because it has very little room left to cut rates.
Japan, which has been in and out of recession for a decade, already faces that problem; the Bank of Japan has cut its official short-term rate to almost nothing, and still has not been able to revive the economy.
The United States is in much stronger shape than Japan, which is suffering from near-paralysis in its banking system after a collapse in real estate prices and an accompanying surge in bad loans.
But one school of economists says the United States cannot ignore the risk that it could confront the same problems that are plaguing Japan: deflation, or a generalized decline in prices, and a liquidity trap, in which official interest rates are as low as they can go, but individuals and businesses will not borrow and spend.
Fed officials do not see deflation as a threat now, and they have signaled that they will not hold off on rate cuts simply to keep monetary ammunition in their arsenal.
Indeed, the Fed has suggested that it still has room for cuts if needed. After its most recent cut, it said that inflation was likely to decline from its already low level. As inflation slows, the "real" level of interest rates -- the nominal rate minus the inflation rate -- increases, meaning monetary policy grows tighter if the Fed leaves rates steady.
In a recession, the Fed usually pushes the real rate below zero. The real rate is already negative if inflation is judged by the Consumer Price Index, which climbed 1.9 percent in the 12 months through November. But Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, prefers a measure known as the core personal consumption deflator, which rose 1.6 percent over the last 12 months, leaving the real fed funds rate slightly positive.
The Fed also tends to keep cutting rates as long as the unemployment rate is rising -- even though unemployment tends to lag behind other economic indicators in responding to slowdowns and recessions. Most forecasters see unemployment continuing to rise from its current level of 5.7 percent for at least the next few months.
As for fiscal policy, Congress and the Bush administration expect to run budget deficits for the next few years at least. Traditional economic theory holds that governments should run a deficit during downturns. But Mr. Greenspan, and many members of Congress, especially Democrats, subscribe to the theory that persistent deficits will push up long-term interest rates, holding back the economy.
It is not clear if the two parties will seek to move the government back into surplus and revive the goal of paying down the national debt, or let the deficits continue in the name of paying for national security and giving the economy a short-term lift.
Democrats tend to see budget surpluses and fiscal responsibility as contributors to low interest rates and prosperity. Republicans tend to see surpluses and debt reduction as byproducts of prosperity.
That debate will be just one of many that rages into, and maybe throughout, 2002.

Telecommunications Industry Too Devastated Even for Vultures

BYLINE:  By SIMON ROMERO 

 BODY:
The resounding boom in telecommunications investments from 1996 to 2000 fizzled in 2001, when at least 27 telecommunications companies, each with more than $100 million of liabilities, filed for bankruptcy protection. The industry may require a year, or perhaps even two, before a muted recovery starts to take place.
 Even the vulture investors, like hedge funds, private equity companies and funds within investment banks that specialize in distressed businesses, may not be attracted to the carcasses of once-ambitious companies that now litter the industry's landscape. 
 It is painfully clear that the telecommunications debacle eclipsed in size all recent investment bubbles, whether they involved dot-coms or oil wildcatters. 
"It's hard to tell when the pain in telecommunications will ease because the crisis is so extensive," said Edward I. Altman, a bankruptcy expert at the Stern School of Business of New York University.
Telecommunications companies accounted for nearly half the $45 billion of defaults in high-yield bonds in 2001, according to a study of the securities by Mr. Altman and Pablo Arman, a research associate at N.Y.U. The telecommunications industry had a default rate of 18.4 percent, compared with an overall default rate of 4.5 percent.
Vulture investors may find few opportunities among the telecommunications carnage. While they often seek to restructure ailing companies, as they did with such recession-battered industries as retailing or real estate in the early 1990's, they also look at companies' cash flow.
"What currently makes telecom bankruptcies unique in the history of restructuring is that many of these companies had little positive cash flow to begin with," said Jeffrey R. Manning, a managing director of Legg Mason, a financial services company in Baltimore.
The vultures also like to glean value from troubled companies' assets in legal proceedings, but that is difficult in an industry that embraces technologies that are subject to rapid changes. For example, much of the fiber strands and laser-based equipment in communications networks will be obsolete in a few years.
"It's not like a steel mill you can buy and idle for two years while you work things out," Mr. Manning said. "In two years the company and its technology could be worthless."
There are additional reasons behind the debacle. One is that the huge buildup in capacity on transcontinental and transoceanic communications networks was fueled by a similar expansion in the number of the communications companies. Few of these start-up concerns would generate enough cash to be profitable.
When financing for such ventures dried up, these companies slowed or halted purchases of communications equipment. That generated weakness at large equipment makers like Lucent Technologies and Nortel Networks and the smaller producers of fiber optic equipment.
Parallel crises gripped the wireless communications industry in Europe, where large carriers, in hindsight, overpaid governments for next-generation mobile Internet licenses, and in the long-distance industry in the United States, where intense competition reduced revenue for heavyweights like AT&T, WorldCom and Sprint.
Of course, not all is grim in telecommunications, an industry that provided a major underpinning for the economic boom of the late 1990's. Some important areas of the industry are still relatively insulated from distress, like the local telephone businesses of Verizon Communications, SBC Communications and BellSouth.
Large wireless carriers like Cingular Wireless, jointly owned by SBC and BellSouth; AT&T Wireless Services; and Sprint PCS are also doing fairly well.
Still, about 450,000 telecommunications jobs disappeared around the world in 2001, after breakneck expansion during the last five years.
After Congress approved the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which strengthened competition in areas like the Internet and wireless and long-distance communications, investment in the industry surged. Capital spending climbed at an average rate of 17.7 percent a year from 1996 to 2000, compared with average annual growth of 7.5 percent in the 30 years before 1996, according to Credit Lyonnais Securities.
"It's difficult to put the current situation into historical context because never before has there been the level of spending as in 1996 to 2000," Gabriel Lowy, an analyst at Credit Lyonnais, said. Mr. Lowy forecast that 2001 and 2002 would be the worst years for telecommunications equipment spending since the mid-1960's.
But some in the industry do not share his gloomy assessment. Telefonos de Mexico and Forstmann Little, the leveraged-buyout firm, for example, recently found value and may inject $800 million into XO Communications in exchange for a controlling stake in the ailing broadband communications company, formerly known as Nextlink Communications. Forstmann has submitted a similar restructuring proposal for McLeodUSA, a telephone company based in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.
Indeed, there is no shortage of optimism at companies that are pinning their hopes on better times in 2002, like the Covad Communications Group, a provider of fast Internet service that won a judge's approval last week to emerge from bankruptcy. "By the end of the year we should see a modest recovery," said Charles E. Hoffman, chief executive of Covad, which is based in Santa Clara, Calif.
Nevertheless, analysts agree that the industry as a whole is likely to go through more consolidation in 2002. Reed E. Hundt, a former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, for example, says there may be one big deal that will set off a wave of consolidation.

HEADLINE: Diller Likely to Disturb Some Hollywood Ways 

BYLINE:  By BERNARD WEINRAUB

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 16 

 BODY:
In taking over Universal Studios, Barry Diller is expected to undertake significant shifts in the financing and production of movies and television that could ripple across the entertainment industry, longtime associates said today.
 At the same time, Mr. Diller, whose attempts to buy CBS and NBC have been thwarted in recent years, is expected to revive bids for a major broadcast network once he is placed in charge of Universal's entertainment operations. 
 Vivendi Universal is expected to announce on Monday that it has agreed to acquire the television and film units of Mr. Diller's USA Networks for about $10.7 billion. The deal will place Mr. Diller in charge of Universal's entertainment and theme park operations as well as USA's remaining businesses, which include Ticketmaster, the Home Shopping Network and Expedia, the travel Web site. 
Not only will the deal make Mr. Diller, 59, one of the most powerful and most wealthy men in Hollywood, but it could also set the stage for a series of changes in the direction of the studio that could have a broad impact on the film and television business.
Mr. Diller, who once ran Paramount and Fox studios, has said publicly as well as privately that studios in recent years had abrogated their responsibilities in holding the financial line, that talent agents, producers, directors and stars had assumed a dominance over the studio and television business that appalled him.
As a result, several entertainment industry executives said, Mr. Diller is expected to examine and even place a lid on lucrative deals that place studios in financially risky straits. These deals include paying stars $20 million or $25 million a film, giving directors so-called "first dollar gross," or profits from every box-office dollar, and arrangements in which studios pay production companies hundreds of millions of dollars to make films without much input.
Universal has two such deals. One is with Imagine Entertainment, a company owned by Brian Grazer and Ron Howard, which has made films that include "Apollo 13" and "Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas,"." The other is with Working Title, a British production outfit whose films include "Four Weddings and a Funeral." 
Privately, Mr. Diller has railed against such deals, which greatly diminish a studio's leverage despite substantial financial outlays.
"Over the years Barry became more and more disenchanted with the movie business -- the economic margins were shrinking and shrinking and the egos were getting bigger and bigger," said Leonard Goldberg, a top producer and former studio chief and a longtime friend of Mr. Diller who helped start his career. "It became harder for him to justify the way the business was going."
Mr. Diller has already told the current leadership of Universal (Ron Meyer, a friend who is chairman of Universal Studios, and Stacy Snider, chairwoman of Universal Pictures) that he has full confidence in them and wants them to stay. Under Mr. Meyer and Ms. Snider, the studio over the last few years has had one of the most successful runs ever, with hits like "Erin Brockovich," "The Mummy" series, "The Fast and the Furious" and "American Pie."
Mr. Diller has told friends that the two have "done a first-rate job" and that he would support them. At the same time, Mr. Diller has said that he will not impose his own culture on the already successful culture of Universal.
But Mr. Diller also told one friend that he wanted to "stir things up" at Universal -- as he has done throughout his career -- and would certainly participate in the decision-making process involving films and television.
Mr. Diller's disillusionment with the movie-making business was tempered two years ago when his company, USA Films, produced the movie "Traffic," the critically acclaimed fictional exploration of the war against drugs. The movie, released last year, cost $40 million to $45 million and took in about $250 million at the box office worldwide. It also won four Academy Awards.
People connected to the movie and others close to Mr. Diller said he was planning to shut down USA Films until "Traffic" was released. The movie serves as a paradigm for what Mr. Diller wants in a film: the star, Michael Douglas, and others were paid relatively low fees, and the movie itself was a critical and financial success.
Over the years, Mr. Diller has championed other movies that are, in some ways, similar to "Traffic." These movies, including "Reds," "Ordinary People," "Terms of Endearment" and "Broadcast News," are serious and critically praised and, in most cases, earned money. But Mr. Diller also made the Fox film "Die Hard," in 1988, spending an unusual $30 million for the successful action movie. At the time, the cost was criticized as excessive. Today, few studio films cost as little as $30 million.
Mr. Diller, who has been a subject of continuing fascination in Hollywood for years, may have a considerable effect on the studio culture if he plays hardball with agents, stars, directors and producers. Not only is Mr. Diller expected to set financial limits on deals, his friends say, but he will play a hands-on role on placing limits on the creative side. That is, Universal under Mr. Diller is not expected to hand over films to directors and some stars who have gained almost total control over the final versions.
On the television side, Mr. Diller has told friends that he will spend his early months merging the USA Networks and its properties into the Universal structure. The new company will be combined with, among others, Mr. Diller's USA Network, the Sci-Fi Channel and USA Films.
Mr. Diller is also expected eventually to make another bid for one of the broadcast networks, which he sees as crucial to the financial viability of companies that own studios. Vivendi, in contrast to several other media conglomerates like Walt Disney and Viacom, has been unable to market and leverage its products on television because it has no cable or broadcast channels in the United States. Walt Disney owns ABC and Viacom owns Paramount Studios in addition to CBS and MTV.
"Barry's feeling about television is it's a terrible business," said one person who has spoken to Mr. Diller recently. "You spend all this money on development, you hire producers and writers, you take all the risks and the odds are slim that you'll make back any money, especially if you give pieces of the show to the talent."
Mr. Diller has told friends over the years that syndicated shows -- like "Hercules" and "Xena: Warrior Princess" -- are potentially far more profitable and less risky than network series. Mr. Diller, whose current company, Studios USA, also produces the popular NBC show "Law and Order" and its spinoffs, has also gained commitments from the network to present the shows on cable almost at the same time, increasing the programs' financial value for his company.
Actually, Mr. Diller's background has centered more on television than on films. In his early 20's, Mr. Diller was hired as an assistant by Mr. Goldberg, then ABC's vice president in charge of programming. At the time, Mr. Diller, a college dropout from U.C.L.A., was an agent at William Morris representing Marlo Thomas.
Mr. Diller, who later conceived the idea of "Movie of the Week" with Mr. Goldberg, was soon placed in charge of buying studio movies for television. 
Years later, when Mr. Diller was hired by Rupert Murdoch to serve as chairman of Fox Inc. and create the Fox network, Mr. Diller endorsed successful on-the-edge shows like "Married . . . with Children," "In Living Color" and "The Simpsons." The shows were hardly upscale, like Mr. Diller's favorite movies. But Mr. Diller nurtured these programs and others because he found the concepts funny and, more important, these programs helped define the Fox network in contrast to other more staid broadcast networks.
"Barry understands and appreciates the highbrow but not at the expense of the lowbrow," said an executive who worked for him for years. "Don't forget he put on some tacky reality cop shows on Fox. They made real good business sense. Maybe they weren't to his personal taste, but they made money."

For Microsoft,a Season of Triumph

BYLINE:  By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
For most technology companies, the fall of 2001 was a season to forget, with its deepening sales slump, losses and layoffs. But for Microsoft, it was a time of triumph, even some vindication. In the federal antitrust case that Microsoft fought so long, with so little success, things turned in the company's favor when the Bush administration decided to settle in November.
 Within weeks, Microsoft announced a settlement with plaintiffs in more than 100 private class-action antitrust suits. To be sure, protests remain. Some states that sued Microsoft are urging a federal judge to toughen provisions of the settlement with the Justice Department, and there are objections to the class-action deal. A European investigation also continues, although Microsoft says it wants to settle that case as well. In all, however, Microsoft has made rapid, dramatic strides toward finally putting its antitrust troubles behind it. 
 The proposed settlement in the crucial federal case is widely seen as a Microsoft victory. It would not restrict the company's product designs, allowing Microsoft to fold software into its Windows operating system for potentially huge new markets, including online shopping, personal identification and downloading music and movies over the Internet. Those features are found in the recently released Windows XP.
And the drastic sanction of splitting Microsoft up -- the remedy championed by the Clinton administration, and approved by a lower court judge, but regarded quite skeptically in a federal appeals court ruling in June -- was rejected by the Bush administration. 
But the settlement terms do require Microsoft to share technical information with competitors and industry partners more openly. In addition, Microsoft would be prohibited from bullying other companies with anticompetitive contracts.
Some Microsoft rivals and industry commentators argue that the case could do a lot to encourage competition, by forcing Microsoft to change its corporate behavior.
Microsoft's legal team is certainly echoing the behavioral theme. "The client has learned a lot through all this," said William H. Neukom, the tall, silver-haired general counsel and legal field general in Microsoft's antitrust battles.
Mr. Neukom, 60, is stepping down next year, and his designated successor, Bradley P. Smith, suggested that priorities for Microsoft would be to establish a "strong track record of compliance" with the settlement order and to "strengthen our ties with the rest of the industry."
But legal pressure is not the only thing forcing Microsoft to change. Technology trends -- notably the spread of Internet technology -- are equally responsible.
Over all, investment in technology may have slowed, but Bill Gates, the Microsoft chairman, believes that some cooling off may be healthy. With the get-rich-instantly mentality of the dot-com bubble gone, Mr. Gates said, chatting with journalists in October, "I think the environment for doing major research and development -- real innovation -- is better now than it was before." Certainly it is for Microsoft, which is sitting on $36 billion in cash.
Microsoft is putting some of its capital to work by investing heavily in the development of "Web services," mainly clever software sent over the Internet to automate all kinds of business and personal tasks. A company's data will be linked with a supplier's to replenish needed parts automatically, for example. Or a person's scheduling data, stored on a PC or hand-held computer, will interact with the dentist's data to set up an appointment or with an airline to arrange travel.
To realize these goals will require open communications in software, which raises privacy and security issues that must be resolved. The move will also require businesses to form partnerships and trusted relationships with other companies. This will mean a change of many corporate cultures, including Microsoft's.
Consequently, over the next several years, it will be very difficult to determine the legacy of Microsoft's antitrust conflicts, because so many other forces will also be shaping the company and the industry.

HEADLINE: Arts in America: It's Museum Time Down South; 
From Virginia to Louisiana, a Building Boom for Culture

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN KINZER 

DATELINE: MOBILE, Ala. 

 BODY:
On the shore of a shaded pond a few miles from the Gulf of Mexico construction machinery roars and screeches in a din that is now familiar across the southeastern United States.
 This is the sound of art museums being built. Here it is a new building for the Mobile Museum of Art, which is to cost $15 million and open next year. 
 Across this region, which has long felt culturally overshadowed by other parts of the country, an extraordinary building boom is under way. New art museums, or large additions to existing ones, are being planned, built and opened in more than a dozen cities. 
In Florida the Norton Museum of Art in West Palm Beach is raising $20 million for a new wing, only a few years after raising $30 million to double its size and add to its endowment. Museums in Tampa, Boca Raton and Fort Lauderdale have also begun building campaigns.
Two major projects are under way in North Carolina and two more in Georgia, with projected costs totaling over $150 million. Museums in Tennessee, Alabama and Mississippi are also part of the boom, along with others on the borders of the region, in Louisiana and Virginia.
This boom is based partly on the desire of many Southerners to bring more fine art to their communities. Although some museums here have superior collections that are languishing in storage for lack of display space, directors of some others are still uncertain what they will hang on their new walls.
In many cities business leaders are supporting these projects in the hope that they will draw tourists and attract more talented work forces. The economic prosperity of the 1980's and 90's made many of these business figures rich, and they have contributed millions of dollars to museum fund-raising campaigns.
Museum directors, acutely aware that donors want to use museums as tools for economic development, are competing with one another to produce the most striking buildings. Several have hired renowned architects and asked them to come up with buildings so unusual that they may become tourist attractions in their own right.
"There's a kind of breaking out of the shell of that inferiority complex we might have had," said Joseph B. Schenk, director of the Mobile Museum of Art. "We're behind the curve of museums in New England or the upper Midwest or California. But during the 1990's people here realized they were doing well enough to begin concentrating on quality-of-life issues. There was also a fair amount of reverse migration from the North, which brought with it not just people and ideas but also art collections."
Frank Gehry, the architect whose dazzling Guggenheim Museum turned the dreary Spanish port of Bilbao into a worldwide tourist destination, is designing a new museum in Biloxi, Miss. It is to house the work of a single artist, George E. Ohr, a Biloxi potter and sculptor who died in 1918. A local arts patron and former mayor, Jerry OKeefe, and his family have donated $1 million to the museum building fund and raised another $7 million. The Ohr-OKeefe Museum is scheduled to be completed in 2004 at a cost of $16 million.
"We see the Gehry building as something that can bring us to a whole new level of tourism," said Marjorie Grady, the museum's executive director. "Our conservative projection is for 100,000 visitors in the first year, and it could easily be much more."
In Savannah, Ga., Moshe Safdie, designer of the Skirball Cultural Center in Los Angeles, has been chosen to design a new building for the Telfair Museum of Art. He had to revise his design in the face of local criticism, but a new version has now been accepted, and the $18 million building is to open in 2004.
Some promoters of this wave of new construction wonder whether there is enough outstanding art in the South to fill these museums, or enough money to buy it. Diane Lesko, executive director of the Telfair Museum, said she shared that concern.
"I would hope every new building is being built for reason, to fill a need, and not just for vanity," she said. "If you do it just to pull out works in storage that are not first or even second tier, you're not going to make it. People may come once to see the building and the display of the collection, but that's it."
Major museum building projects in North Carolina include the new Nasher Museum of Art in Durham, set to open in 2003 at a cost of $15 million. It will be affiliated with Duke University, and half the cost was donated by a Duke graduate, Raymond Nasher. The project involves the construction of five buildings around a 10,000-square-foot atrium, and Mr. Nasher has said he hoped it would become one of the most important university museums in the world.
The Nasher Museum is being designed by Rafael Vinoly, designer of the new Kimmel Center for the Arts in Philadelphia. Mr. Vinoly has also been chosen to design another project in the South, a $46 million expansion of the Tampa Museum of Art that will quadruple its exhibition space and serve as the anchor for a new waterfront cultural district.
Less than 50 miles southeast of Durham, in Raleigh, an even more ambitious museum project is unfolding. The North Carolina Museum of Art there has begun a campaign aimed at raising $89 million for a campus of exhibition halls that will provide 180,000 square feet of new space.
"We Southern folks take a while to catch up, but we're catching up now," the museum director, Lawrence J. Wheeler, said in an interview. "The South has changed. It's more cosmopolitan than it used to be. There's a definite growth in the number of people who appreciate art, as well as in the number of patrons and the available resources.
"At the same time you have a real shift in the perception of what art museums can be," he added. "People realize that they're not just culturally and economically beneficial, but that they can become very important centers of community life." 
Taking note of what he called a tendency among Southerners to value tradition and history and to turn their backs on the creations of their own times or recent history, Mr. Wheeler said: "People with money have always preferred the familiar, things that had history written on them. They've loved old houses, old silver, decorative arts, furniture, old rugs and pictures -- that sort of thing. You had to look hard to find collections of contemporary art. But that's also changing. We've had a lot of contemporary-art exhibitions, and they've become more and more popular. I don't worry about whether there will be audiences for the new."
With competition among museums a clear though intangible factor in the current building surge, it is not surprising that the North Carolina Museum of Art bills itself as "the Southeast's premier visual arts museum," while the High Museum of Art in Atlanta stakes the same claim, calling itself "the leading art museum in the Southeast."
The High Museum, which opened in 1983 with an award-winning design by Richard Meier, could not stand still with so much construction across the region, and it has begun raising an estimated $100 million for renovating its building, constructing a new wing and strengthening its endowment.
"We may be at another in a series of rebirths of the South, asserting a higher level of cultural aspiration after having achieved a higher level of economic success," said Michael Shapiro, director of the High. "It's what occurred in other, older cities beginning in the late 19th century."
"One thing that may evolve from it is alternative exhibition pathways," Mr. Shapiro said. "The traditional trajectory is New York to Chicago to Los Angeles or maybe San Francisco. Now there might be one from Atlanta to Houston to some place like Denver or Seattle or Phoenix."
Like other arts administrators who are overseeing expansion projects in the Southeast, Mr. Shapiro said his financing has remained secure since the shocks of Sept. 11. "Our plans are moving ahead absolutely on track," he said, "and in fact we have received some of our largest donations since Sept. 11."
Many of these projects are being planned and built with unusually strong emphasis on education. Museums seek to offer libraries with computer stations, interactive exhibits, and rooms full of hands-on activities to engage young people.
One new Southern institution, the Frist Center for the Visual Arts in Nashville, is built around an educational complex and a series of empty galleries. Working on the assumption that it is now prohibitively expensive for new museums to build world-class collections, the Frist does not plan to bid for art at auction. Instead it will concentrate on serving as a kunsthalle, a site where shows from other places are presented.
The Frist, which opened in April, is housed in a lovingly restored former post office, complete with handsome corridors and Art Deco details. Most of the $45 million cost was donated by a wealthy local family, one of whose most prominent members is the United States Senator Bill Frist.
As its first show the Frist presented a collection of European masterworks from the Art Gallery of Ontario that included paintings by artists ranging from Rembrandt and Tintoretto to Picasso and Dufy. It is now displaying treasures of medieval and Byzantine art from the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore and illuminated manuscripts from collections in Philadelphia.
"We want to provide a space for people to come and see some of the very finest art that exists in the world, but that's only part of it," said Chase Rynd, director of the Frist. "We're going to seize on to each exhibition to educate people about that moment or medium or historical period. We hope to inspire a whole generation of people who are not familiar with the visual arts."

HEADLINE: THE STEM CELL DEBATE; 
Defining the Undefinable: Being Alive

BYLINE:  By NATALIE ANGIER 

 BODY:
Much as people may wish these days for the comforts of a few black and white distinctions -- between good and evil, democracy and tyranny, friends and fiends -- our restless color wheel of a world refuses to comply. And that law of equivocation and qualification, scientists say, extends down to the most basic distinction of all: whether something is alive or not.
 Obvious though the differences may seem between a sleeping cat and its pillow, or a patch of lichen and its rock, scientists have had a devilishly difficult time specifying, delimiting and agreeing on the characteristics that define life, and that exclude the apparently nonliving. 
 The question is not one of mere semantics or taxonomics. As the nation once again takes up the angst-riven issue of extracting stem cells from human embryos for possible use in the treatment of a raft of diseases, researchers must weigh not only the question of when human life begins, but what being alive really means. 
"People have long sought to define and understand it," said Dr. Mark A. Bedau, a philosopher of biology at Reed College in Oregon. "The question is especially interesting now that science and technology are continually pushing the boundaries of what living systems or lifelike systems exist, and what they may look like in the future."
As an example of the trickiness that technology can bring to the definition of life, scientists cite new experiments showing that monkey eggs can be chemically treated and modified to the point where they begin behaving enough like embryos to generate stem cells -- all without the addition of sperm normally required for embryogenesis, and without any capacity to grow into a baby monkey.
Assuming that human eggs could be similarly stripped down and par thenogenetically reinvented, how "alive" would these wholly unnatural and almost entirely fabricated stem cell factories be? How much more alive must they be adjudged, scientists ask, than are the chemical reactions in a test tube that yield synthetic versions of vital hormones, or that attempt to mimic the conditions early in the earth's history, when life began?
"We've gotten to the point where we have RNA molecules that replicate in a test tube," just as RNA is thought to have done at the dawn of life four billion years ago, said Dr. Jeffrey L. Bada, a professor of marine chemistry at the University of California at San Diego, who studies the origin of life.
"But no one has dared to call that living yet," Dr. Bada said. "We have to incorporate all kinds of chemicals to make that replication happen." Keeping embryos alive in the laboratory, he said, or manipulating eggs for research, "is not too much different than working with evolving RNA molecules in a test tube."
As Dr. Lawrence M. Krauss, the chairman of the physics department at Case Western Reserve University, sees it, an embryo floating in a petri dish is little more than a chemical factory, not so much alive as prelude to life, and no worthier of being considered a mini-human being than a block of uncarved marble is worthy of being called Michelangelo's Pieta.
"The distinction between organic material that has potential one day to do something, and something already functioning as human being, is very great," said Dr. Krauss, who often writes about the effects of science on society. "I'm amazed when people view the potential as if it's real."
A number of scientists argue that humans are too mired in anthropocentric, or at least biocentric thinking, and thus are likely to award membership in Club Life solely to organic life forms, while withholding it from worthy entities or systems that display many properties of life without being carbon-based.
Some say that the economy and the Internet, for example, are alive in the same sense that an ant colony is alive; all are super organisms, with the individual functions widely distributed yet intimately connected, mutually responsive, dynamic and ever-changing.
Those in the field of so-called artificial life believe that many properties of life can be captured in digital format, and that by viewing the performance and behavior of these computerized species, researchers may better understand what life outside the terminal is all about.
A-lifers, as they are sometimes known, write computer programs that begin with relatively simple codes, or instructions, which, once liberated to run free on anything from desktop P.C.'s to university supercomputers, follow their own paths and aggregate into spectacularly diverse digital "ecosystems."
One of the most famous such programs is Tierra, created in the early 1990's by Dr. Thomas S. Ray, a professor of zoology at the University of Oklahoma, and since disseminated to programmers around the world. Tierra began with a bit of computer code 85 bytes long called the Ancestor, which spawned daughter codes, which in turn generated other daughter programs, some of them 10 or 100 times as long as the original Ancestor.
The replication parameters were less than perfect, just as DNA replication in the carbon-based world is less than perfect, resulting in minor changes, or mutations, from one generation of Tierrans to the next. The organisms assembled themselves into habitats, he said. They competed, they cooperated, they cheated, they parasitized, they parasitized the parasites. They reproduced with varying success, and, as living things are wont to do, they died.
Most vividly of all, said Dr. Ray, Tierra abided by Darwinian law: it evolved. "For me, the central, defining property of life is evolution by natural selection," he said. "And that's a property I've captured in my work."
So while he won't flatly say that Tierra life is alive, he won't dismiss it as a mere model of life either. "We're creating things in a twilight zone between life and nonlife," he said. "It leads to the recognition that life isn't cut-and-dried, yes-or-no. There are shades of life and aliveness." Yet when asked if he felt sorrow at the "death" of any of his Tierrans, he said, "No, no more than I would over the death of a virus or bacterium."
Other scientists are more skeptical about the possibility of machine life approaching real life, or of a computer or robot being so nimbly programmed that it attains some form of awareness, a conviction that it is alive and that, like HAL of "2001: A Space Odyssey," it does not want to die.
"There are lots of variations on the idea that computers, if not already alive, are on their way to becoming alive, and that for better or worse they will be a successor species to the human race," said Jaron Lanier, a computer scientist and pioneer in virtual reality. "I've always objected to that, which has made me the black sheep at a lot of computer conferences."
But Mr. Lanier argues that computer scientists who think of computers as alive, or practically sentient, write bad computer programs that make everybody stupider. He cites the classic Turing test of a computer's sophistication, devised by the great British mathematician Alan Turing. 
According to Turing, if a judge cannot distinguish between the answers given by a computer and those from a person, then the computer must be considered essentially conscious, and should be given equal rights.
Mr. Lanier proposes another interpretation of such a result. "Turing assumed that the computer in this case has become smarter or more humanlike," he said. "But the equally likely conclusion is that the person has become dumber and more computerlike."
"Consider all the ways that we bend to a mechanized process by doing stupid or irrational things," he added, as when college students are advised to begin building up a good credit rating by borrowing money and paying interest to feed data into the credit rating system. "So students are bending over backward and doing economically foolish things to make the credit algorithm look smart," he said.
Ultimately, in Mr. Lanier's view, the experience of being alive is a subjective one that may not be amenable to definition or algorithmic recapitulation. "Science studies repeatable phenomena and empirical things that can be tested," he said. "But the experience of being alive is not detectable by instruments, and at some point we may have to admit it's a big question mark that we're never going to be able to answer."
But like a beckoning finger, a question mark can prove irresistible, and professional thinkers have long mulled over the definition of life.
Aristotle constructed a stepladder of life "essences." "Aristotle talked of the vegetative soul, which is basically equivalent to life at the cellular level," said Dr. Lee M. Silver, a professor of molecular biology and public affairs at Princeton. "Then there was his sensitive soul, equivalent to organisms with a functioning nervous system, and finally his rational soul, the human being."
As Aristotle saw it, then, not only were human beings generally superior to all other species; they were, at their core, more alive.
At the other end of the scala natura is the virus, a source of many lively scientific debates. To live means to use energy, some have argued, to metabolize, to eat. Viruses do none of these things. "They show no properties of life," said Dr. Lynn Margulis, a professor of biology at the University of Massachusetts. "No metabolism, no self-maintenance. They're about as alive as is sugar or salt."
Yet some virologists defend the animate nature of their subjects by pointing out that viruses secondarily metabolize, by forcing their host cells to devote most of their metabolic energy to the production of new viruses.
The pathogens are all too clever at getting around, and they even evolve. "Viruses are smart enough to direct their own reproduction," said Dr. Arnold Levine, a virologist and the president of Rockefeller University in New York. "I've always thought of them as alive, although in a dormant state."
An even thornier case is the prion, a nasty infectious protein that lacks even the virus's nucleic blueprint to make more of itself, yet somehow manages to make more of itself in the brains of its unfortunate hosts, leading to devastating illnesses like mad cow disease and kuru. Can something that possesses a core trait of life -- the impulse to go forth and multiply -- be blithely dismissed as lifeless?
And then there is bronze disease, a k a rust. "Rust can be contagious," said Dr. J. Doyne Farmer, a professor at the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico, who has worked on problems modeling biological systems. "The more rust you get on a car's body, the more the rust propagates. Nobody would say that bronze disease is alive, but already, even at the elementary level, there's some notion of contagion, and something that seems alive."
In this spirit of inclusiveness, many life theorists emphasize systems rather than individuals as a way of grasping the meaning of life. "To focus on the superficial characteristics of what makes a particular fly or a particular human alive is to miss the underlying unified explanation for those hallmarks," said Dr. Bedau of Reed College.
In his view, the key to life is something he calls "supple adaptation," the capacity of populations or groups to respond to changing circumstances by continually creating new adaptations. Thus, the dinosaurs died out not because they expired one by one, but because their population somehow lost all capacity to respond to shifting conditions. Their suppleness fossilized, and they soon followed suit.
In this vein, some experts say, the current stem cell debate, by focusing on human embryos afloat in the laboratory and divorced from their ordinary biological and evolutionary context, ignores the connectivity of the human race, the social, emotional and ultimately physical link among people that is epitomized in the relationship between the mother and her gestating fetus.
"Until very recently in human history, the moment when somebody was said to be there was with the quickening," said Dr. Barbara Katz Rothman, a bioethicist and professor of sociology at the City University of New York. "The moment a woman felt movement, when the baby communicated itself to the woman and she communicated the quickening to others, was the moment that the baby entered the social world. It was an inherently social act: thud! I'm here."
A days-old embryo in a petri dish, or frozen away in a fertility clinic, she said, makes no thud and has no umbilicus to the world around it. It must of necessity await definition by the lives that flicker around it, who are themselves caught up in the uncertainties and disputes that are life's most assured gifts.

HEADLINE: Climate Change: The Signs Are There 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Drastic Shifts in Climate Are Likely, Experts Warn" (news article, Dec. 12): 
 What clues help assess vulnerability to abrupt climate change? Variability and rates of change are crucial. 
More variance -- wide swings from norms and intensified weather extremes -- may indicate greater sensitivity to change. Ice cores reveal that greater variability has heralded past rapid change. 
 In the late 1990's, the pace of warming increased. Moreover, changes are occurring in multiple climate system components -- icecover, forest cover, deep ocean and atmospheric temperatures. 
We naturally underestimate the potential for sudden change; but signs of instability are growing. For this reason, along with health, environmental and security concerns, it is time to phase out fossil fuel dependence. An economic stimulus package that rewards the transition to clean energy could help revitalize the economy and give the climate a chance to restabilize.

HEADLINE: A Port Authority Tenure Shadowed by Crisis 

BYLINE:  By RONALD SMOTHERS 

 BODY:
It galls Lewis M. Eisenberg, who stepped down last week as chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, that through some caprice of history, his time at the agency will be bracketed by two painful bookends: the rebuilding of the agency's trophy property, the World Trade Center, after the 1993 bombing, and the toppling of the towers Sept. 11.
 "I had thought the bookends of my time would have been things such as improved efficiency and converting assets to produce more capital for the agency's core transportation mission," Mr. Eisenberg said in an interview. "I don't like to think of it the other way." 
 But with an equanimity that marked his tenure at the often fractious agency, Mr. Eisenberg, 59, found a more positive legacy in the rubble of the twin towers: Gov. George E. Pataki's announcement last week of a $544 million plan to build a temporary PATH station beneath the trade center site that would allow service to resume between Lower Manhattan and New Jersey. It would be a big step, said Mr. Pataki and Acting Gov. Donald T. DeFrancesco of New Jersey, toward revitalizing downtown and "renewing the spirit of New York."
Mr. Eisenberg, a New Jerseyan, said Mr. Pataki's praise was a far cry from the derision New Yorkers once reserved for the PATH line and its Lower Manhattan station, long considered a deficit-ridden afterthought to the construction of the trade center that benefited only New Jersey and drained money from other projects. 
"PATH had always been a four-letter word for New Yorkers, and now it is the first major appropriation by the Port Authority after Sept. 11 and it is announced by a New York governor," Mr. Eisenberg said. "If those combined statements by the two governors don't bespeak a quintessential regionalism, I don't know what does."
Regional cooperation is the reason the Port Authority was created 80 years ago, but in 1999, squabbling between Governor Pataki and New Jersey's governor, Christie Whitman, created an impasse that stalled major projects for 18 months. Many people credit Mr. Eisenberg with seeing the agency through those troubles. 
"It was difficult for the two states to collaborate on issues, but Lew succeeded in getting one of the Port Authority's biggest achievements -- sale of the World Trade Center -- and he got the agency back into transportation and out of real estate," said Robert Yaro, executive director of the Regional Plan Association, a nonprofit group that promotes regionalism. "He does not walk on water, but he has done exceptionally well."
Still, there are those who see Mr. Eisenberg's term as chairman as continuing the erosion of the port agency's independence from the two governors. Jameson W. Doig, a Princeton University history professor who has written a history of the agency, said that while the agency's board was once made up of independent captains of regional industry, it is now increasingly filled by political appointees who seem tied and perhaps beholden to the governor who appointed them.
To Professor Doig, Mr. Eisenberg's personal style in the governors' disputes was perhaps "too passive." He may have been willing and "sharp enough" to know the direction in which the agency should move, the historian said, "but he was not a regional development person, and the board surrounding him lacked the independent strength and understanding."
James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, disagreed, saying that during the impasse between the governors, Mr. Eisenberg kept the agency moving forward. "It just seems he is an extremely steady person, and is not prone to any outbursts and tries to put in quality leadership," Mr. Hughes said.
During Mr. Eisenberg's tenure, the agency invested more than $10 billion in the region and adopted a $9.5 billion five-year capital program that will generate $14 billion in spending. It raised money with long-term leases, including to the World Trade Center, the Vista Hotel and the Newark Legal Center. It opened the "train-to-the-plane" link at Newark International Airport and is building a similar rail line to Kennedy International Airport. 
In the interview, Mr. Eisenberg played down his role in the agency's accomplishments, instead crediting its 7,200 staff members and the governors. He does own up to a talent for surrounding himself with competent, committed staff members, a knack he said he got from his father, who he said often told him, "Even a weak swimmer can be carried to shore on a strong wave."
A former partner at Goldman Sachs who still heads the investment firm Granite Capital International Group, Mr. Eisenberg was appointed a Port Authority commissioner in 1994 by Governor Whitman after serving on her committee charged with finding cost-saving ways to privatize public services. A longtime Republican fund-raiser, he admits his view then was of an agency grown bloated under the oversight of Democratic administrations in each state. 
His mission was to streamline the Port Authority and speed up the sale of real estate, from office buildings to industrial parks, that it had acquired over 20 years. Mrs. Whitman chose him as chairman the next year. The streamlining included the elimination of 2,000 of the Port Authority's 9,200 jobs. 
In the year before the trade center attack, Mr. Eisenberg devoted much of his time to helping Mr. DiFrancesco come up with a plan to build a new sports arena for Newark and a Disney-like family entertainment complex in the Meadowlands. Mr. DiFrancesco nominated him to head the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, which would build and oversee the two projects, and Mr. Eisenberg had drafted a letter of resignation, dated Sept. 12, that was in his desk at the Port Authority headquarters in the trade center when the planes hit.
"I was going to the New Jersey Sports Authority, but Osama bin Laden had other plans," he said.
The big plans for the sports authority and Newark arena have foundered, but Mr. Eisenberg's ambitions have not. He said he was considering a run next year for the United States Senate seat held by Robert G. Torricelli. Mr. Eisenberg would bring a similar edge in personal wealth that his former Goldman Sachs colleague, Jon S. Corzine, a Democrat, brought to his successful run last year for New Jersey's other Senate seat.
Mr. Eisenberg's replacement as Port Authority chairman is Jack G. Sinagra, a Republican who is a former New Jersey state senator. Mr. Eisenberg will continue to be a Port Authority commissioner, and is the only New Jersey resident to be appointed to the Lower Manhattan Redevelopment Board created last month by Mr. Pataki to oversee the downtown rebuilding.
Asked how his popularity on the east side of the Hudson might sit with New Jersey voters should he run for elective office, Mr. Eisenberg said, "Let's just hope that they look at me as a regional citizen."

HEADLINE: City Report Says the Economy Will Shrink 3.1% Next Year 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
New York City's economy will shrink next year for the first time since 1991, according to a report that was issued yesterday by City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi. The report predicts that the aftershocks of the attack on the World Trade Center will contribute to a net loss in jobs, a slowing of growth in wages and a sharp decline in the amount of money that the city will be able to collect in taxes in the next year.
 The report, an annual look at the city's finances and economy, predicts that the city's economy will shrink by 3.1 percent in 2002. It would be the city's first yearlong decline since the recession of 1991, and Mr. Hevesi's report suggests that much of it will be a result of the attack, rather than the national recession. The city's economy grew by 5.2 percent in 2000 and by an estimated 1.4 percent this year. 
 "The city's economy was weakening before Sept. 11, but was still stronger than the national economy," Mr. Hevesi said in a statement. "Now, due to the impact of the trade center attack, New York City's economy is expected to be weaker than the national economy. The nation is expected to recover in the second half of 2002, but the outlook is not as good for the city."
The city had been creating jobs at a rate faster than the nation until Sept. 11. Then, in October alone, the government reported the loss of 79,000 jobs in the city, a 1.6 percent decline, which is more than five times the national figure of a 0.3 percent decline in jobs that month.
Through the end of this year, the report estimates, the city will have gained an estimated 17,000 jobs, down sharply from last year. 
Next year, the Hevesi report estimates, the city will suffer a net loss of 68,200 jobs, driving its unemployment rate to 6.7 percent, up from an average of 5.7 percent in the last two years. 
The report presents a grim picture of jobs lost; a drop in the amount spent in the city by tourists; a rise in the amount of empty commercial real estate; and decreases in the amount of taxes the city can expect to take in. "The city," the report says bluntly, "has had a devastating year."
In a letter that he sent yesterday to members of the City Council, Mr. Hevesi wrote that his office's previous estimate that the World Trade Center disaster could cost as much as $105 billion in the next two years "may even be on the low side." 
Mr. Hevesi's report estimates that tax revenues will decline in the current fiscal year by 7.1 percent, or $1.6 billion. (They grew last year by 4.2 percent.) But he predicts that the amount taken in will begin to increase again in 2003, and that by 2004 the city will be able to recover the lost revenue.
But it also holds hope that the money spent by the government and the insurance industry on the cleanup of the trade center site and on compensation to the relatives of the victims and to the owners of affected businesses could lead the city to begin showing signs of recovery next year.
"The sooner the task of reconstruction begins, the sooner the recovery will start," the report said.

HEADLINE: New Wave of the Homeless Floods Cities' Shelters 

BYLINE:  By PAM BELLUCK 

 BODY:
With unemployment rising and housing costs still high, cities around the country are experiencing a new and sudden wave of homelessness. Shelters are overflowing, and more people this year are sleeping on floors in dingy social service centers, living in cars or spending nights on the streets. 
 In New York, Boston and other cities, homelessness is at record levels, a consequence of a faltering economy that has crumbled even further after the Sept. 11 attacks. 
 A survey by the U.S. Conference of Mayors released last week found that requests for emergency shelter in 27 cities had increased an average of 13 percent over last year. The report said the increases were 26 percent in Trenton; 25 percent in Kansas City, Mo.; 22 percent in Chicago; 20 percent in Denver; and 20 percent in New Orleans. 
An unusual confluence of factors seems to be responsible for the surge. Housing prices, which soared in the expansion of the 1990's, have not gone down, even though the economy has tumbled. A stream of layoffs has newly unemployed people taking low-wage jobs that might have otherwise gone to the poor. Benefits for welfare recipients are expiring under government-imposed deadlines. And charitable donations to programs that help the disadvantaged are down considerably, officials around the country said, because of the economy and the outpouring of donations for people affected by Sept. 11.
"This is an unprecedented convergence of calamities," said Xavier De Souza Briggs, an assistant professor of public policy at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. "It's really a crisis."
More than half the cities surveyed by the mayors' group reported that in the last year people had remained homeless longer, an average of six months. 
There is no total number for the homeless nationwide. Experts said it was difficult to compare the situation with statistics in previous decades, because counting methods have improved. Yet, several experts said they believed that the increases reported by cities like Boston and Chicago reflected a national trend.
"My impression is there is more homelessness now than there was 20 years ago," Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution, said, adding that he believed that economic factors were not the sole explanation.
"I think that there must be a greater segment of our population that has tenuous connections to family and friends, and therefore has fewer resources to fall back on when something very bad happens like when they lose their job," he said.
An increasing proportion of the homeless are families with children, compared with the chronically homeless who often have serious mental illness or substance abuse problems. Requests for shelter from families with children increased in three-quarters of the cities surveyed. In more than half, families had to be broken up to be accommodated in shelters.
Some newly homeless people have jobs but do not earn enough to allow use of a home. Low-cost housing is so tight that one-third of the vouchers for the Section 8 subsidized-housing program are being returned unused, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
Several experts and advocates for the homeless predicted that the number of homeless people would rise in coming months as states and cities, facing budget crises and burdened with security costs, scaled back on financing for housing and other programs that help keep people from becoming homeless, like rent assistance and health care.
A senior policy analyst for the Coalition for the Homeless in New York, Patrick Markee, said: "Now, especially since Sept. 11, we're seeing the recession effect, low-wage workers who were just holding on, messengers, people who work in restaurants turning up at our door. We're going to see it get worse over the next few months."
In Rhode Island, the state is dropping a $5 million housing program from its budget. Yet this month, a crush of homeless people forced the opening of a shelter in an old convent in Warwick, the first new shelter for the homeless in the state in 10 years. This year, 120 families with children have slept on the floor of Travelers Aid, a social service center in Providence that is not a shelter.
In New York, the number of people in shelters, 29,802 as of last month, is the highest ever. According to the Coalition for the Homeless, the number of families in shelters has grown 50 percent in three years, to 6,669, while the percentage of children in shelters has risen 60 percent, to 12,576. Mr. Markee said 1,500 families were being housed in welfare hotels, three times as many as three years ago. 
In Boston, officials conducted a census of the homeless on Dec. 10 and found 6,001 homeless people, a record, said Kelley Cronin, director of the Emergency Shelter Commission. Ms. Cronin added that the number of people on the street, 277, was also the highest on record.
Chicago reported in the mayors' survey that the number of people who were homeless or receiving emergency assistance to keep them from becoming homeless had jumped, to 19,421 from 15,682 last year. 
In a school district in Sacramento, Liane Ramirez, who works with homeless families, said she had already seen twice as many families living in their cars as she had seen in the previous few years combined.
"We feel like we're seeing a lot more first-time scared-to-death homeless," Ms. Ramirez said. "And we're looking at working homeless, not just welfare homeless."
Some aspects of the problem seem clearly related to the terrorist attacks.
Before Sept. 11, the Boston Rescue Mission, a large shelter, had a $90,000 contract with Delta Air Lines to clean the carpets of its planes. The contract, which the airline had been planning to double, employed 30 homeless people from the shelter, said John Samaan, the president of the mission. After Sept. 11, Delta halved the contract instead, putting one-third of the workers out of work. 
In Portland, Ore., the Goose Hollow Family Shelter, the largest family shelter in the city in the winter, usually receives thousands of dollars in donations in September, said Chuck Currie, its director. This year, it received one contribution, for $100.
"I've heard other agencies say contributions have dropped 20 percent to 70 percent," Mr. Currie said.
Programs that provide services to the homeless are also bracing for the state budget cuts.
In Illinois, homeless services are highly likely to be affected by state plans for a $485 million budget cut.
"It's going to send programs like ours into a tailspin," said Diane Nilan, an administrator at a large shelter in Aurora, a Chicago suburb whose shelter has been so crowded that Ms. Nilan has asked for a portable classroom to add space.
In many cities, shelters said they were seeing more people who became homeless after having lost jobs or being priced out of apartments.
In Dallas, Oscar Turner, 52, was laid off from his $8-an-hour job as a Wal-Mart greeter in early October and has been staying at free shelters, unable to afford the small rent that he had paid before. Mr. Turner has looked for work with the city as a crossing guard or maintenance worker, but so far, he said, "it's not going too good."
In Charlotte, N.C., Tyrone Hicklen, 43, was laid off at a party-supply store and has been living in shelters for two months. Unable to find work, he is heading to Kansas to enroll in a truck-driving school.
In Rhode Island, John Swenson, 44, took refuge at the Warwick shelter with his 10-year-old son, Michael, after he could not find work at his home in Hyannis, Mass., and lost a part-time job cooking hamburgers in Warwick. 
"It's kind of late in life to be needing something," said Mr. Swenson, unemployed for the first time in 15 years and used to $14-an-hour jobs. 
"I knew there were shelters," he said, "and that's part of what kept me out of them. On the Cape, I helped paint the shelter in Hyannis. I went from painting a shelter to being in one."

HEADLINE: Move in Congress Would Relax a New Disclosure Law 

BYLINE:  By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 17 

 BODY:
In the closing days of the Congressional session, a senior House Republican is trying to loosen year-old disclosure requirements intended to shed light on the spending and fund-raising of certain tax-exempt groups engaged in politics.
 The law won large majorities in the House and the Senate last year, becoming the first major change in campaign finance requirements in more than two decades. Now Representative Bill Thomas, Republican of California, is working to amend it to eliminate what he considers redundant and burdensome provisions, aides said today. 
 The law was enacted to bring accountability to a growing number of secretive groups, conservative and liberal alike, that were active in political advertising and direct-mail appeals but that were not subject to federal reporting requirements because they did not explicitly advocate election or defeat of a candidate. 
Even some sponsors of the law say it has had unintended consequences, forcing candidates for state legislatures who already file contribution reports with their states to make reports to the Internal Revenue Service as well.
In the Senate, Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican of Texas, and two Democrats, Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut and Russell D. Feingold of Wisconsin, have offered a proposal, less sweeping than Mr. Thomas's, that would relieve state and local groups of duplicative paperwork. But the initiative awaits action by Mr. Thomas, because changes in tax-related law must originate in the House and its Ways and Means Committee, where he is chairman.
One Republican staff member said the Thomas proposal might be attached to an economic stimulus package.
Another Republican aide called such a tactic unlikely, saying it would be too controversial. But he said the measure might nonetheless come up for a vote this week.
A number of House Democrats and groups that want to restrict campaign spending say the measure should not be rushed through Congress with little scrutiny.
"There has been ample opportunity to correct this problem, but not behind closed doors in a stimulus package," said Representative Lloyd Doggett, a Texas Democrat who was a sponsor of the law enacted last year. "I think we have to be very careful in addressing any concerns that state and local organizations raise not to create new loopholes."
Barbara Ann Clay, a spokeswoman for Mr. Thomas's committee, said she had no comment on the issue.
But another Republican aide, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified, said the chairman wanted only to end redundant paperwork and would keep intact the core requirements that secretive political action committees report to the federal government. "We don't want to create any loopholes," he said.
The aide said that under the proposal, the law would no longer require reporting to the I.R.S. by state and local tax-exempt groups that engage only in local political activities and that report to states having disclosure rules "substantially similar" to those of the federal government. Mr. Thomas would also eliminate the annual I.R.S. filing requirement for state and national groups that already report to the Federal Election Commission or to states.
An array of interests including state legislators and the American Society of Association Executives have been pushing for such changes.
"This isn't about disclosure," said Jim Clarke, senior vice president of the society, which represents leaders of a variety of professional and trade associations. "It's trying to take groups that are in good faith disclosing and not making them have to do it twice."
But critics say the changes would go too far. They fear that once the legislation emerges in its final form, it will not clearly define what "substantially similar" means in its discussion of how state disclosure rules must approach the requirements of federal ones. The result, they say, will be a cutback on information available to the public, because some states have loose reporting requirements.
Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, called the proposal "another attempt to dismantle what's left of any restraints on unlimited campaign contributions."

HEADLINE: Democratic Lawmakers Oppose New Spending Near Session's End 

BYLINE:  By LAURA MANSNERUS 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Dec. 17 

 BODY:
Democratic leaders tried to cut off spending today by the Republicans who control the New Jersey Legislature, warning that they would not support any measures that would worsen a deficit predicted to be about $1.4 billion this fiscal year.
 The Democrats, who will take over the Legislature and the governor's office next month, fended off a revision in the corporate tax structure that would have lowered most companies' taxes and that business leaders said was essential to stimulating the state's economy, although a vote could still be scheduled after New Year, in the Legislature's final week. 
 "The Republicans running the show in the Legislature and the governor's office seem to want to run out the clock on their time in charge by spending until they literally don't have the power to spend any more," said Senator Richard J. Codey, the minority leader. 
When the new Legislature meets on Jan. 8, Democrats will have a firm upper hand in Trenton, which they have not enjoyed since the early 1990's.
The Republicans are ceding control of the Assembly and the governor's office for the first time in 10 years. The Senate will be evenly split, 20-20, and its leadership shared.
Mr. Codey also said that when he serves as acting governor for three and a half days before Governor-elect James E. McGreevey takes office next month, he will order a recertification, or an official accounting, of the state's revenues. Mr. McGreevey has been urging Acting Gov. Donald T. DiFrancesco to recertify the revenues since shortly after the November election.
As Mr. Codey, along with the Assembly speaker-elect, Albio Sires, made the call for an end to new spending, the Legislature was facing votes this afternoon on about 150 bills. Many were scheduled for a vote only late last week.
Among the bills not voted on was a proposal to recalculate New Jersey's corporate income tax, which would result in lower taxes for large corporations with headquarters in the state. When the bill was approved by the Senate Budget Committee last week, it was opposed by all of the Democratic committee members, including Senator Bernard F. Kenny, one of its original sponsors.
Committee members were told that the measure, to be phased in over five years, would cost the treasury about $12 million in its first year.
Today, the Democrats, including Senator Codey, did support a bill providing tuition aid for children and spouses of victims of the Sept. 11 terror attacks. It was approved in a 39-to-0 vote.
The Assembly is scheduled to meet on Thursday, but the Senate has only one more voting day, Jan. 7, before the session closes.

HEADLINE: WITH SEATS EMPTY, AIRLINES CUT FARES TOBARGAIN LEVELS 

BYLINE:  By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
Airlines desperate to fill seats in the economic downturn that deepened after Sept. 11 are cutting some fares to levels not seen in years. 
 The deals include several destinations, like Hawaii and the Caribbean, that have rarely been put on sale during the winter season. On some routes to Europe and Asia where bargains could be found in previous years, the discounts are deeper than usual. 
 For example, a round-trip coach ticket from Los Angeles to Tokyo is on sale for as little as $398 on American Airlines. Coach seats to London from New York are being offered as low as $198 round trip by several airlines, while business-class tickets to several cities in Europe from the Midwest and East Coast that have full published fares of more than $6,000 are now going for $1,200. 
Still, some travelers have been disappointed to find few bargains on the routes that they want to fly. Especially in the United States, tickets to many cities continue to be offered at high prices that were set during the peak of the travel boom, which ended last year. Many of the best fares are already sold out during peak travel periods like the coming Christmas and New Year's holidays. And most such fares carry many restrictions. 
But there are still some bargains to be had on specific routes, according to travel agents. "There are pockets and pockets of good deals," said Tom Parsons, chief executive of Bestfares.com, a Web-based discount travel agency. "The best of the best is overseas."
American Airlines and United Airlines recently extended a range of deals, including round-trip flights to London from San Francisco for $398 and to San Juan, P.R., from New York for $269. Tickets must be bought by Dec. 28 for reservations through May 19. 
In addition, Southwest Airlines, the low-fare king, is offering a coast-to-coast round-trip fare of $198 for some seats between now and June 7. The sale ends on Dec. 27. Southwest mainly flies from secondary airports; most transcontinental trips require one or two stops.
Virtually all such bargain fares must be bought in advance, are not refundable, are restricted to certain days of the week, and may require a Saturday stay. Many of the sales end this month.
The low prices appear to have helped overcome some people's jitters about flying after the terrorist hijackings on Sept. 11 -- which is the point. 
Passenger traffic dropped by 40 percent after the attacks. It has since moved back up to some degree. "The people we talk to find that there is no crisis in consumer confidence right now," said Karl Peterson, chief executive of Hotwire, a discount travel agency on the Internet. "People are willing to fly."
At most airlines, the average percentage of seats filled on each plane has returned to the 60 to 70 percent levels that prevailed before Sept. 11. But that is after the carriers cut the number of seats they offer by 15 to 25 percent. Overall traffic is still down about 20 percent.
Most important to the airlines, many of those missing passengers are business travelers, who paid the highest fares and were responsible for the bulk of airline profits. The weakness in business travel started early this year, with the downturn in the economy, and has been worsened by the terrorist attacks. 
Mr. Peterson said he attended a seminar earlier this month with 50 other chief executives from a variety of industries. Many, he said, acknowledged that they were using the events of Sept. 11 as an excuse to reduce expenses by limiting business travel.
Some airlines have experimented with reducing business fares but most have not cut their walk-up fares, arguing that price reductions do not stimulate an increase in business travel. 
As a result, the airlines have had to depend on presumably more flexible leisure passengers to fill their seats. But that has required deeper discounts, and most of the major carriers are losing millions of dollars a day. 
"People are getting a real bargain out there," said Douglas M. Steenland, the president of Northwest Airlines, "because the industry at present is not covering its costs."
Mr. Parsons agreed. "If you are paying 3 cents a mile and it costs the airlines 10 to 12 cents a mile, you know you are getting a good deal," he said, alluding to some of the lowest fares to Asia. 
The best bargains he sees right now, Mr. Parsons added, are to the Caribbean. US Airways is offering round-trip tickets for around $250 to destinations like Jamaica, the Bahamas and the Cayman Islands from Boston, New York and Washington, as much as 60 percent lower than prices last winter.
Most airlines offer an extra 10 percent discount if tickets are purchased on their Web sites.
"We usually don't see 85-degree- weather destinations go on sale for January, February and March when you have all those snowbirds in the Northeast," Mr. Parsons said.
On trans-Atlantic routes, where passenger traffic has been hit especially hard by the economic downturn, US Airways and Northwest Airlines are offering discounts of more than 80 percent off full-fare business-class tickets to a variety of European cities. But these tickets must be bought by this Sunday and used before Jan. 10. Coach fares have also come down significantly on many routes. 
There are many routes where few bargain tickets can be found. For example, nearly all discount tickets to Florida before and after Christmas and New Year's have been sold. It is also difficult to find cheap seats to cities in Arizona, Las Vegas and many other destinations west of the Rocky Mountains.
Mr. Parsons said it was wise to lock in bargains to warm-weather destinations like the Caribbean now for trips in February and March because fares might rise, especially when the cold weather settles in on the East Coast after an unusually mild fall.
But he added that it could be smart to wait before buying a ticket to Europe for travel in the first half of 2002 because prices might drop further. "If you are departing after March 15," Mr. Parsons said, "my advice is to put your feet up, have a cup of coffee and wait."
Mr. Peterson of Hotwire, though, recommended grabbing bargains now because, he said, the industry cannot afford to keep offering such low fares.
Referring to a $198 transcontinental fare, he said: "That is a fantastic deal that people should not be banking on being out there in the next six months. My advice is don't count on it going any lower."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: COMMUNITY; 
A School Finds Strength in a Network of Grief

BYLINE:  By JANE GROSS 

 BODY:
The catalog of loss at Xavier High School is both familiar and harrowing: 60 dead in the World Trade Center terror attack, including alumni, as well as close relatives of teachers, staff members, and students past and present.
 Three boys without fathers. An assistant headmaster without a son. The autumn alumni magazine remade with a memorial cover of yearbook pictures -- 10 fresh-faced teenagers in black tie, class of '74 to '96, all of them gone in an unimaginable cloud of smoke and concrete. 
 Grief, then, hangs heavy in the hallways, classrooms and chapel on West 16th Street in Manhattan. Young and old alike remain dazed and pale three months later. "This is something we'll be dealing with for a long, long time to come," says the Rev. Daniel J. Gatti, Xavier class of 1959 and the school's president. 
Xavier faces a test of moving forward that is dreadful, to be sure, but it is one the Jesuit school is equipped to meet. Unlike, say, Cantor Fitzgerald, this is a religious institution, led by clergy, not bond traders. Unlike a firehouse, with its muscular bravado, this is a place where young men are taught to talk openly and with a sense of vulnerability about faith and God.
Here, then, there is an identifiable path out of the darkness, a set of well-established rituals to help 1,000 students, teachers and staff members move from grief to renewal. And so to spend several days inside this 150-year-old school is to appreciate one of the rarer phenomena of the trade center disaster: a wounded place that is actually coping, in specific, regular and reliable ways.
In religion classes, instead of murky abstractions, questions of the deepest and most painful kind are asked and, at least sometimes, answered. At the school, despite no escape from the hurtful reminders, there is daily access to church, and thus to prayer and the chance to try to figure out what good might come of the obvious evil.
"They can challenge our hearts but not change them," repeats the Rev. David S. Ciancimino, class of '77 and Xavier's headmaster, at the many memorial Masses he has offered. "That is our great sanctuary, if you will."
In the classroom, students are often instructors. The Rev. John Garvey, who teaches religion, recalled the day in November when his faith was at its shakiest. The school was tentatively steadying itself when an airplane crashed in the Rockaways, home to scores of Xavier students and staff members. Of the five people killed on the ground, four had Xavier connections. 
Into a quiet classroom, where Father Garvey was struggling to grade papers, came James Dowdell, 17, whose father, Kevin, had died at the World Trade Center along with five other firefighters from Rescue Company 4 in Queens. James had been to the Rockaways crash site, near his home, eager to help, even if it meant passing out cups of water to rescue workers.
When his father's fire company arrived on the scene of the plane crash, James told Father Garvey, they greeted him as "one of us now." The teenager could barely contain his pride.
"I was really down," Father Garvey said. "I had the 'whys.' When James came in, my presumption was I had to take care of this boy, swallow my grief and be there for him. But he reminded me that we had to go, be, do, act, stop the 'what ifs' and deal with what is. He was the voice of hope, love and caring."
Xavier has also drawn on its legendary network, the generations of Irish and Italian families from the farthest reaches of the five boroughs who have sent their sons here, propelling them into the city's middle class. Everyone who has ever gone to Xavier knows everyone else, or so it seems. They played on the same Catholic Youth Organization basketball teams, went to the same colleges, drank at the same bars, surfed the same beaches, worked at the same firehouses and brokerage firms. 
These connections, a source of jobs and social life in good times, now provide sustenance of another kind in the face of unfathomable loss. For James Dowdell, that means leaning on people he has known since childhood, among them Jayne Lee, Xavier's college counselor and a neighbor in Breezy Point, Queens. 
Mrs. Lee held James in her arms the day school resumed after Sept. 11 -- with extended homeroom periods for organized discussion and a Mass for the dead -- and told him her heart was broken. Since then, he has visited her office daily, lured by the candy she has put out for 900 teenage boys, each stricken in his own way. 
James's grades are holding up, unlike those of many of his fellow students. He postponed his SAT to November from October, made an early-decision application to Iona College, where his brother, Patrick, goes, and says he is "doing O.K." Running track helps, although James has switched from cross-country to sprints because long runs give him too much opportunity to ruminate.
James can also turn for comfort to John Burke, Xavier's assistant headmaster and another Breezy Point neighbor. Mr. Burke, too, is caught in the wide, dark net of grief, having lost his son Matt, class of '91 and a budding broker at Cantor Fitzgerald. Many of Matt's friends died as well: James Riches, a basketball star from the class of '89; Charles Herron, class of '96 and a colleague at Cantor; Sean Lugano, an Xavier classmate whose uncle is the school's defensive line coach and whose cousin is a sophomore.
Mr. Burke finds solace in numbers. "You don't want to say to anyone, 'Gee, I'm glad your relative died,' " he said. "But if this had happened and my Matt had been the only person killed. . . ." He paused to gulp back the tears. "It's devastating enough. But it would be more devastating in loneliness."
Loneliness is the last thing anyone need worry about at Xavier, which, the school likes to say, has been turning out "men for others" since 1847. At the adjacent church, a Mass for the school's dead, in late September, drew more than 1,500 people. Father Gatti described communion as gridlock. A police officer outside, an Xavier alumnus, closed the street to traffic. Then, with a megaphone, he led the crowd in a chorus of the school's fight song: "maroon and blue, we'll see you through."
When the two hijacked jets exploded into the World Trade Center, the administrators at Xavier knew they had a tragedy on their hands of vast, personal dimensions. Nearly 100 students -- the children of firefighters, police officers and anyone who worked in the twin towers -- were summoned to the library. Among them were two boys, in addition to James Dowdell, who would soon learn that their fathers were lost: Constantine Economus, a freshman, and Robert Twomey, a junior, whose uncle was also killed. 
Keeping watch over the traumatized boys was Lorraine Longing, the director of guidance. She knew, but told nobody until the end of the day, that her sister-in-law was among the missing, and her brother was kneeling in prayer in the Xavier chapel. Along with other school officials, Ms. Longing orchestrated an orderly dismissal that day, found beds in the Jesuit residence upstairs for the few boys who could not get home and began planning the healing process.
In the months since, using her own evolving reactions as a guide, Ms. Longing has been meeting with guidance counselors, faculty members and students, as well as sending home letters to their parents. She tells them to be alert for fatigue, headaches, loss of appetite, lapses in concentration, slipping grades. 
"I don't want anyone to think that because three months have passed, we have all felt what we're going to feel," she said. Ms. Longing, on some days, looks as peaked as the students. Along with her mother and sister, she is helping her brother care for his sons, one just shy of 2 years old and the other an infant.
Xavier students, faculty members and administrators say that anger is a bigger stumbling block than loss of faith. Father Gatti points to the surge of patriotism and generosity as proof "that God can work good out of anything and everything."
James Dowdell, after a recent Xavier retreat, said, "There's not a question that my dad's up there with God, and that's nice."
Even Mr. Burke, despite a momentary reservation, settles into a peaceful place. "We have a retarded child, a grandson who's blind and now I've lost my son," he said. "Give me a break. I'm human. Of course it tests your faith. But faith is a choice and this is an environment that nurtures it."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL; 
Bids Get Higher To Buy Red Sox

BYLINE:  By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
Another day, another dollar; another day of bidding, another few hundred million dollars. That is the direction the sale of the Boston Red Sox has taken.
 Prospective purchasers engaged in yet another round of bids yesterday, this time not only for the majority interest in the team but also for the rest of the team. Totals bids -- for the Red Sox, Fenway Park and 80 percent of the New England Sports Network -- were expected to approach or surpass $700 million. 
 Representatives of the Jean R. Yawkey Trust, which owns 53 percent of the team, did not disclose any details of the bidding, but four groups had been expected to remain in the running for the right to spend the most money ever for a baseball team at a time when Major League Baseball officials are loudly lamenting the game's economy.
This latest round of bids was apparently prompted by an unexpected, perhaps preemptive, move three weeks ago by Charles Dolan of Cablevision. 
Dolan submitted a bid for the Yawkey share said to be $405 million, then added $250 million that he said he would pay the limited partners so that he could own 100 percent of the team.
A person with knowledge of the sale process said it was decided to have another round of bids to determine if other prospective buyers wanted to duplicate Dolan's decision to go for the whole team. 
The limited partners, who are scheduled to meet Thursday with John Harrington, the Red Sox chief executive, can decide individually if they want to sell their shares. But they will decide together to approve or reject the bidder Harrington recommends selling the Yawkey share to.
Under terms of the ownership agreement, a bidder must gain approval of a majority of the 23 limited-partner shares to buy 53 percent of the team. Those shares are divided, based on ownership percentage, among the four individuals, two companies and two trusts that make up the limited partners.
Harrington owns one limited-partner share. The Yawkey Trust has three shares, meaning Harrington would need eight more shares for his recommendation to be accepted. The two largest limited-partner shareholders are the Aramark Corporation, the Fenway concessionaire (7.5 shares), and the Dexter Group (6.5 shares).
Dolan's bid three weeks ago was said to be the highest of that round. His $405 million was reportedly followed by $380 million from Joseph O'Donnell and Stephen Karp, Boston entrepreneurs, and $330 million from the group headed by Tom Werner, former managing partner of the San Diego Padres.
But another bidder, a group headed by Miles Prentice, a New York lawyer, reportedly came in with another bid that topped Dolan's after being bolstered by the addition of the Quadrangle Group, a private investment fund. 
Prentice did not return a telephone call yesterday seeking comment, but a spokesman confirmed that he remained in the chase. The other three bidding finalists were expected to be Dolan, O'Donnell and Karp, and the Werner group.
Not entirely clear is the presence of John Henry in the Werner group, which also includes The New York Times Company. Henry owns the Florida Marlins but is in the process of selling the team to Jeffrey Loria, the New York art dealer, who is the managing partner of the Montreal Expos, one of the two teams Commissioner Bud Selig wants to eliminate before next season. 
Because legal challenges have delayed Selig's plan, it is very likely that the Expos will not be eliminated this winter. The only way for Loria to be permitted to buy the Marlins, thus freeing Henry to be a part-owner of the Red Sox, would be for someone else to assume operation of the Expos for next season.

HEADLINE: Up a Texas Channel Without a Dock 

BYLINE:  By KATE MURPHY 

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Dec. 17 

 BODY:
Residents of Galveston cling to the century-old glory days when their port city was the largest and most prosperous in Texas. But their port has long since been upstaged by Houston's, 50 miles up a ship channel to the northwest.
 Now Houston's port, the nation's second largest by cargo volume, is bursting at the seams, and the acquisition of the Galveston port is seen as the best route to expansion. When Galveston residents vote on the merger on Tuesday, though, their pride may well scuttle it. Some residents welcome the deal, or at least see the economic necessity of it, but others resent Houston's "nouveau riche" and "parasites" stealing their history. 
 A merger would be a boon to Houston's economy, reeling from the demise of its largest corporate citizen, Enron, and recent layoffs at Compaq Computer and Continental Airlines. Galveston, a cash-hungry island town where housing projects surround Victorian mansions, has no tax base for improving the port.
"I want it to happen -- it's got to happen," said William J. Messina, general manager of maritime services at the Houston office of Maersk Sealand, a Norwegian international shipping line. "There's no more room at the Port of Houston."
Without Galveston, shippers would soon have to dock at distant ports like Charleston and New Orleans, and truck their goods inland. "It's an added expense and will waste valuable time," said Jim Morrison, vice president of the West Gulf Maritime Association, a regional trade group representing shipping lines, stevedores and terminal operators. 
The diversion of marine traffic would also hurt local manufacturers of goods for export, who face higher costs, as well as consumers, who will pay more for imports. In terms of cargo volume, Houston has grown an average of 4.5 percent a year in the last five years, driven mainly by the import and export of petroleum products, plastics, organic chemicals and cereals. Top trading partners include Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, the Netherlands and Belgium. Houston plans to build additional docks in Bayport -- between Houston and Galveston -- but needs Galveston, too.
Also, the Galveston port is closer to the open sea. "It's an extra five hours in transit time to go up the channel," said Michael Bird, who manages the Houston office of Transmarine Navigation, a shipper based in Long Beach, Calif. It is worth it if the cargo is destined for Houston, he said. But Transmarine's freight, like half the cargo loaded and unloaded in Houston, is generally going or coming from elsewhere. It would be less costly to transfer goods to trains and trucks in Galveston. 
The channel is also too shallow for the "new mega-cargo-vessels that are on the drawing board," Mr. Morrison said.
Stevedores, who load and unload cargo, would also like to see the merger approved. "It would help my customers, and whatever helps my customers helps me," said Frank Fogarty, vice president of P & O Ports Texas Inc., a stevedore company with crews in both Houston and Galveston. He said the merger would attract more business to the ports, which means more business for him.
"It's a win for everybody," Mr. Fogarty said, giving the Houston port room to grow and improving Galveston's docks. "They're rickety, the pilings need to be replaced and there are big holes in the wharves," he said.
The merger calls for the Port of Houston Authority to spend $30 million on renovating the Galveston port. The authority has also pledged to retire $21 million of the smaller port's debt and make annual payments to Galveston of around $2 million for a decade. On top of that, a University of Houston-Clear Lake study predicts the merger will bring 2,100 jobs and some $90 million in business to Galveston in the next 5 to 10 years. 
Many in Galveston are resisting. "People here have long memories," said Harris L. Kempner Jr., who runs Kempner Capital Management. Though he supports the merger, he disdainfully refers to Houstonians as "mainlanders."
Houston port officials have spent the last year lobbying Galveston officials and making their case to often hostile residents at town hall meetings. "We've faced some pretty rough crowds, but I hope we've been able to convince them," said Thomas Kornegay, executive director of the Port of Houston Authority, who prefers not to speculate on the outcome of the election.
Though Houston port officials have won the endorsement of the Galveston mayor, city council and the local economic development council, voters are evenly divided.
"The merger was a huge underdog a couple of months ago, but now I think the odds are about even," Mayor Roger Quiroga of Galveston said. "We're on the edge of our seats."

To the Editor:
Re "Hail and Farewell," by Anthony Lewis (column, Dec. 15): 
 Faith in reason is the direct, logical outgrowth of the Judeo-Christian tradition. Fundamentalist religious faith, exhibited in most of the great religions today, can only constrain and harm the human enterprise. 
 We continue to wage war on subjugation by race and gender. Reason must be applied to the world's homophobia, nationalism, economic disparity and health inequality in order to vanquish these evils.
With faith in reason, the hard work and the great promise for us lie ahead.

Nets' Rise Exposes the Knicks' Decay

BYLINE:  By HARVEY ARATON 

 BODY:
THERE he stood, in the fast-emptying lower stands of Madison Square Garden, watching the corporate ticket holders scramble from their seats as if free cellphone service were suddenly available outside. "Terrible, just terrible, for us to come in here and win like this," Lewis Katz, the principal owner of the New Jersey Nets, said mischievously.
 He was wearing a black leather jacket with Nets on the back and holding his own cellphone and making no attempt to minimize his glee or his team's 114-96 tutorial victory over the Knicks Sunday night. 
 "The Nets are for real," Katz crowed. "We can play with anyone in the conference right now." 
Be it mere symbolism or actual proof, there must be some relevance to Katz's contention that a seismic power shift in the East has finally occurred, based on New Jersey's 3-0 swing through Chicago, Miami and New York. Compared to the Nets' conference-leading 15-7 mark, the combined record of the three dominant Eastern franchises for much of the 1990's stands at a sobering 20 up and 48 down this morning.
Up, up and over the rim went the Nets rookie Richard Jefferson late in the fourth quarter Sunday night, for Jason Kidd's garbage-time underhand setup from out by the arc. The resulting slam punctuated the Nets' second stylistic statement made to their longtime tormentors, the first blowout of the Knicks occurring last month at the Nets' house across the Hudson, west of Eden.
Even the remaining Knicks fans got a charge out of the Kidd-Jefferson improvisation, with the conspicuous exception of three nonpaying attendees on the baseline near the Knicks' bench. There sat the Knicks' ruling triumvirate -- James L. Dolan, Steve Mills and Scott Layden -- stunned, stone-faced and stupefied by their team's fourth consecutive defeat under the new coach, Don Chaney.
For the time being, and if only because two decades of covering pro basketball has taught me to avoid overreacting in December, I am inclined to adopt the posture of Keith Van Horn more than owner Katz's. 
"It takes more than 22 games to establish a dominance or a fan base," Van Horn said. 
The Knicks have played their way out of these ruts before. They can't be as bad as they have looked recently and it's premature to claim the Nets, as entertaining as they are, won't come back to earth and the pack. After his 27-point outburst Sunday night, Kerry Kittles was last seen limping into the locker room. It was his ankle, not a knee, but it was also a reminder of how fragile most N.B.A. equations can be, especially the Nets'.
Have the Knicks suffered psychological damage after the unequivocal surrender of the little coach whose obsessive mission had been their collective advance? Chaney has inherited a team that is apparently short on standup guys. Larry Johnson was a galvanizing influence -- not to mention a rare Knick, when healthy, with low-post skills -- but he's gone. Latrell Sprewell talks a lot but there is a difference between honesty and leadership. It is possible that Jeff Van Gundy's surprise exit was enough to nudge the Knicks toward the slide they must take eventually, given their roster deficiencies and salary-cap straits.
The more pragmatic explanation and one that is much fairer to Chaney is that Van Gundy just picked an opportune time to quit. The Knicks had won five of six but close inspection of the five reveals one victory of note, at Milwaukee. They barely beat a struggling Atlanta team twice. They rallied at home against woeful Houston. The notion that Marcus Camby would solve all ills was as silly as the promotion of him as a premier center. Even Camby says he is not a center -- he's a wonderfully athletic off-the-ball presence at both ends of the floor.
"I've never seen them double-team this much," Van Horn said, referring to the open looks the Nets, a superb passing team thanks to Kidd, had from the perimeter Sunday night. "They've always had faith in their man defense, and played us that way."
The Knicks no longer have that luxury, with Camby giving away bulk most nights, with Sprewell trying to guard the likes of Kenyon Martin and with two other defensive liabilities -- Allan Houston and Mark Jackson -- in their starting lineup. This all speaks to the work the personnel maven Layden has done since Dolan's disastrous decision not to hold onto Patrick Ewing for one last season. That would have allowed the Knicks to begin whittling down the payroll, slot by slot. With all of Layden's maneuvering, all the spending, Layden's Knicks are old, small and have not a single transcendent offensive talent.
Only in a conference devoid of a dominant power and in obvious transition can they still legitimately set their sights on a midrange playoff position, while Lewis Katz points his Nets even higher.
"Look at what Kidd has done for Kittles, Martin and Van Horn," he said. "The Nets are a contender -- a good, young team that should, absent injury, get better and better."
The Knicks have more reporters crowding into their press-row seats. They have famous celebrities phoning for front-row exposure. They have more shapely dancers and draw bigger crowds, even when they are faking sellouts. 
The New Jersey Nets will never own New York. They just want out of the Meadowlands and into a new arena in Newark, and Katz knows the time to be lobbying hard is now.
"If the state doesn't make a favorable decision now, I believe the team will move away," he said. He meant out of New Jersey, not the metropolitan area, because the YankeeNets' startup network doesn't need winter programming from Nashville or New Orleans.
Katz went on about how much sense the arena makes for Newark, for the state, and why enterprise-zone taxes should pay for a private arena in a bad economy and with New Jersey's governor-elect, James E. McGreevey, soon to inherit huge budget deficits. Once upon a time, the Katz ownership team talked about sharing profits in Newark, but then George Steinbrenner became a partner, and now Katz says, "We're at a stage where it's pure business."
Like any distracted chief executive, he flipped open his cellphone and made plans to meet someone outside. The arena was almost empty. While Dolan, Mills and Layden were huddling solemnly in a corridor beneath the stands, Lewis Katz walked out of Madison Square Garden a winner.

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Europe: Britain: Airbus Cuts Jobs 

BYLINE:  By Kerry Shaw (NYT) 

 BODY:
 The European aviation giant Airbus Industrie said that it would eliminate 500 jobs in Britain, and announced cost-cutting measures that would save the equivalent of 9,400 jobs in France, Germany and Spain. The chief executive of Airbus, Noel Forgeard, insisted that these measures did not include layoffs, but instead reduced the number of work hours per year. 
"When we get rid of overtime, or move to part-time unemployment we reduce the number of men employed," Mr. Forgeard told Bloomberg News. The year has been a difficult one for the industry; eight days after the Sept. 11 attacks, its American rival, Boeing, announced that it was laying off 30,000 workers. As recently as October, the parent company of Airbus, EADS, insisted that it would not need to lay off anyone. Kerry Shaw (NYT)
