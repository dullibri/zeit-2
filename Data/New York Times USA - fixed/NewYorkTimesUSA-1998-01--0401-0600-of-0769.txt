HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
China Says Banking System Faces a Sweeping Overhaul

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Jan. 16

 BODY:
At the heart of the financial crisis in Asia is a badly kept secret: many bank loans throughout the region are based on a personal or political relationship between banker and borrower.
Cronyism is widespread in Asian business, and in China -- as much as anywhere -- friendship and position can outweigh the law. But crisis can open the way for change. 
 Today, the governor of China's central bank disclosed a sweeping reorganization of the banking system aimed at making it more professional and less political, an undertaking that reflects the desire of Chinese leaders to keep Asia's financial crisis from engulfing them as well.
Dai Xianglong, who heads the People's Bank of China, said that curing the nation's epidemic of bad debt would require a different system of supervising state banks, one modeled on the Federal Reserve in the United States.
"We have to insure that commercial banks will operate according to law, and not be open to interference by any organization or individual," Mr. Dai told a news conference.
Yet the plans Mr. Dai outlined involve such a deep shift in business practice and philosophy that it is highly questionable how much real change can be achieved. Coming just as China is undergoing a wrenching shift from a planned to a market economy, the financial overhaul may also be more difficult at a time when China faces falling investment and slowing economic growth.
Mr. Dai argued this juncture was precisely the time for a bold reorientation, and he pledged to complete the job in just three years, mirroring the Government's plans to sell the bulk of the state-owned enterprises by the end of 2000.
"Just as state-owned enterprises are the key to enterprise reform, the central bank is key to financial reform," Mr. Dai said.
Under the plans he outlined, the central bank would eliminate its main branches in each of China's 30 provinces and replace them with regional headquarters along the lines of the Federal Reserve system. Doing so, Mr. Dai said, would help prevent the local authorities from forcing local banks to finance favored projects, even when they made no sense financially.
A Chinese bank official said the reorganization was likely to centralize financial decision-making power under the control of Zhu Rongji, the Deputy Prime Minister whose authority over economic affairs often puts him at odds with provincial-level officials. Closing so many local bank offices would also mean at least 20,000 layoffs, the official said.
"The idea is that regional bank heads will outrank provincial governors, and won't have to listen to them," said the bank official, who said he supported Mr. Zhu's plans and spoke on condition of anonymity.
One of the modern mysteries of China's financial system, and biggest burden, is the question of how many loans to money-losing enterprises will ever be repaid.
Mr. Dai said today that 20 percent to 25 percent of all loans in China were overdue, but he argued that only 5 percent to 6 percent were actually unrecoverable, a figure that sounds optimistic. Yet even he seemed to acknowledge that China's statistics were incomplete.
"You can argue about whether this 5-6 percent is accurate or not," Mr. Dai said. "But I don't want to hear anyone repeating those rumors that it is 25-30 or even 40 percent. That would be irresponsible."
Even the lower estimate, however, requires a sizable amount of cash if China's banks are to remain solvent. Mr. Dai said the central bank would allocate more than $6 billion to cover unpaid loans in 1998, and another $7 to 8.5 billion in 1999 and 2000.
For many ordinary people in China, a major question of the day is whether the central bank will devalue the currency, the yuan, which will help China's exports but could cause higher inflation. Today, Mr. Dai insisted that the need for financial stability still outweighed the possible benefits of a devaluation. He said China would not devalue its currency this year.
Mr. Dai also expressed support for the determination of Hong Kong to keep its currency's value linked to the dollar, even if doing so drove up interest rates and damaged the stock and property markets.
"Of course China would like to see the stock market and inflation rate remain stable as well," Mr. Dai said. "But compared with these aims, stabilizing the exchange rate is more important."
Mr. Dai described the collapse of Peregrine Investments Holdings, a Hong Kong investment bank that led the market for Chinese share offerings there, as "very regrettable." But he said it would not affect China's plans to list shares of more mainland companies in Hong Kong.
Over all, Mr. Dai offered a relatively optimistic picture for China's economy this year, predicting growth would exceed 8 percent. Growth last year was 8.8 percent. He also said the country's foreign exchange reserves totaled $139.9 billion at the end of 1997.

HEADLINE: Journal;
The 2 Tim McVeighs

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH 

 BODY:
Here's a scenario that could be out of Kafka, or at least Alfred Hitchcock -- except that it's really happening and hasn't been sold to Hollywood. Yet. Its protagonist is Timothy McVeigh -- not that Timothy McVeigh, but a 36-year-old sailor who, through bad luck, not genealogy, found himself with the same name as the biggest mass murderer in American history.
And that's the good news. Last fall, while on duty as the senior enlisted man on a nuclear submarine, he exchanged America Online E-mail with a civilian Navy employee with whom he was organizing a Christmas charity toy drive for kids back at his Honolulu base. His good deed did not go unpunished. His correspondent checked out his "member profile" -- the autobiographical sketch any AOL member can voluntarily post on line -- and discovered that Mr. McVeigh had listed his marital status as "gay." She promptly notified the Navy that it just might have a declared homosexual in its midst. 
 But if the Navy wanted to dismiss the sailor for having violated "Don't ask, don't tell," it had no case. The AOL profile identified this "gay" man as only Tim of Honolulu, with no last name. According to subsequent sworn testimony, a Navy investigator solved this problem simply by asking AOL over the phone for Tim's identity -- and promptly got an answer. Once back on shore, Mr. McVeigh was put under investigation and then ordered discharged, three years short of his pension. Merry Christmas!
The sailor is fighting back in court, however, and in the virtual court of Internet opinion, where his case has been raging for the past week. By the time real judges weigh in he could be easily the second most famous Timothy McVeigh in history. If the Navy investigator did pursue Mr. McVeigh's cyberidentity without either identifying himself or obtaining a court order, it's a likely violation of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act. If AOL did blithely unmask one of its 10 million members (many of whom use anonymous screen names), it too is in legal jeopardy -- and will face a meltdown of consumer confidence that will dwarf its past P.R. disasters over service outage.
So far the Navy is defending its snooping and AOL is pleading innocent. Mr. McVeigh, for his part, has pointedly never declared that he is gay, noting that AOL member profiles routinely fib and fictionalize. His aggressive legal tactics have already sent Government lawyers scrambling; his discharge has been delayed until next Wednesday. By the time he's done, Mr. McVeigh may be the poster boy for the whole country's growing concerns about all kinds of cyberspying.
He may also prove to be the man who finally brings home the absurdity and bigotry of "Don't ask, don't tell." Mr. McVeigh is as clear-cut a victim of a witch hunt as could be imagined, and that witch hunt could expand exponentially if the military wants to add on-line fishing to its invasion of service members' privacy. Multitudes of military personnel identify themselves as gay on the Internet, rank and base often included.
Even if Mr. McVeigh were to prove one such gay sailor, what has he done wrong? He has served his country for 17 years with a spotless record, earning four Good Conduct Medals and the Navy Commendation Medal, among other decorations; his performance reviews cite him as an "outstanding role model" and a leader in crew training on equal-opportunity issues.
Contrast that record with the other Timothy McVeigh's. In his Army stint before, during and after the Persian Gulf war, the Oklahoma bomber was known for fomenting racial polarization by slurring his black peers and assigning them the dirtiest tasks in the motor pool. He openly trafficked in anti-Semitic and racist literature and participated in the activities of off-base organizations toying with armed resistance to the Government. In a published letter to a newspaper editor, he argued that it might be necessary to "shed blood" to achieve his political aims.
What does it say about American fairness and justice -- let alone our priorities in national security -- that the military looked the other way at that Timothy McVeigh's ostentatious public psychosis while it torments the second, exemplary Timothy McVeigh for the "crime" of having a private life that should be nobody's business but his own?

HEADLINE: Taking Leave of the Census

 BODY:
The resignation of the Census Bureau's Director, Martha Farnsworth Riche, does not bode well for hopes that the 2000 Census will be more accurate than the flawed effort in 1990. Ms. Riche, a respected professional demographer, says she has accomplished her goal of redesigning the census process, but regrettably she will not see the difficult task to completion. Her departure robs the agency of the leadership needed to resist political efforts to hijack the census.
Ms. Riche has had to battle fierce political opposition from Republicans on the use of statistical sampling to supplement the traditional head count in the upcoming census. The 1990 Census, which did not use sampling, was the most costly in history and yet missed 10 million Americans and counted 6 million twice or in the wrong place, according to analyses by the National Academy of Sciences. That is because census counts depend entirely on locating people at specific addresses. New immigrants, those in shared housing, migrant workers, the homeless, the poor and young people tend to be undercounted. As these populations grow, particularly in larger cities, the traditional counting approach has become less and less accurate. 
 Professional statisticians and economists, including experts convened by the National Academy, have said that taking a sampling of those who do not return their census forms by mail and using that sample to estimate the uncounted population would be far more accurate than sending field workers out to make fruitless door-to-door counts. Ms. Riche has been a sensible proponent of this plan.
But Republicans have fought sampling because they believe that the missing millions could turn out to be minorities living in areas that vote Democratic, possibly giving Democrats an advantage since census figures are used to draw state and Federal legislative districts. In a compromise deal hammered out between the White House and Republican leaders last November, the Census Bureau was allowed to go forward with a small dress rehearsal using both sampling and traditional counting techniques this year. In exchange, House Speaker Newt Gingrich will be allowed to use government money to bring a lawsuit to stop the use of sampling in the actual census in 2000.
Ms. Riche's departure could leave the Census Bureau without a guiding force when the sampling battle resumes in Congress after this testing period. It appears unlikely that the Republicans will approve a nominee to the post who supports sampling. Yet Ms. Riche bluntly says there is probably no one in the professional community who thinks an accurate census can be taken without sampling. The Administration may decide to shy away from a confirmation battle by naming an acting director to the agency instead. The politics that drives this debate now threatens to undermine what should be a politically neutral government task.

HEADLINE: Comptroller of the Currency Plans to Leave

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 16

 BODY:
The Comptroller of the Currency, who regulates nationally chartered banks, told President Clinton this week that he planned to leave office on April 4, when his five-year term expires.
"I am proud of what we have been able to achieve," the regulator, Eugene A. Ludwig, wrote, citing his involvement with other regulators in easing the credit shortage that hurt the economies of New England and other areas after the 1990-91 recession. 
 He also prodded banks to increase their lending in poor communities and noted that such lending had increased to $43 billion annually from $3 billion before 1993.
If a successor has not been confirmed before April 4, the agency's chief counsel, Julie Williams, will become acting comptroller.

HEADLINE: Clinton and 3 Baltic Leaders Sign Charter

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 16

 BODY:
President Clinton signed a charter of partnership today with the Presidents of the three Baltic countries, once among the "captive nations" under Soviet rule, and pledged American support for their aspirations to join NATO.
"This charter of partnership underscores how far your nations have come," Mr. Clinton said in the White House East Room to Presidents Lennart Meri of Estonia, Guntis Ulmanis of Latvia and Algirdas Brazauskas of Lithuania. 
 "Almost exactly seven years ago today, Baltic citizens were facing down tanks in the struggle to reclaim their independence," Mr. Clinton said. "Today your democracies have taken root."
The charter does not guarantee NATO membership but offers Washington's explicit support for the Baltic nations' efforts to join. "America is determined," Mr. Clinton said, "to create the conditions under which Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia can one day walk through that door."
America's security is tied to Europe, Mr. Clinton said, "and Europe will never be fully secure if Baltic security is in doubt."
The charter says the United States has "a real, profound and enduring" interest in the security and independence of the three countries and their integration into organizations like the European Union and the World Trade Organization.
Without pledging the United States to the defense of the Baltic countries, the charter embodies a moral and political commitment to their independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity and sets up a Partnership Commission to promote democracy and market reforms.
America's NATO allies, wary of alienating Moscow by extending NATO membership into the former Soviet Union, insisted that the charter also reflect NATO's ultimate responsibility, as a collective alliance, for choosing new members.
"Membership must not be just in the interests of the Baltic states," a senior NATO country official said. "It must serve the overall strategic interests of the alliance."
President Ulmanis of Latvia said today: "This charter will serve as a key for the next century. It makes us allies."
In another action today, Mr. Clinton, for the fourth time, renewed his waiver of a provision in the Helms-Burton Act that tightens American sanctions on Cuba and allows American citizens to sue foreign companies doing business from properties that were expropriated from American companies by the Castro Government.
The United States has been under increasing pressure from allies to end its decades-old embargo on Cuba. Pope John Paul II, who visits Cuba next week, has chided Washington for the hardship its policies impose on the Cuban people, and European and Canadian allies have criticized the legislation.
The Soviets annexed the Baltic nations after overrunning them in 1940, but Washington never recognized the annexation. "For 50 years," Mr. Clinton said today, "Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian Americans kept alive the dream of Baltic freedom." Mr. Brazauskas's recently elected successor as Lithuanian President, Valdas Adamkus, fled Soviet rule as a teen-ager and came to the United States, retiring in 1996 as a top administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency's Chicago region.
"With its bipartisan support for a nonrecognition policy, America was a true friend of the Baltics in a time of need, acting as a beacon of hope throughout the long, dark and cold years of the Soviet occupation," President Meri of Estonia said today.
"NATO enlargement to the Baltics will be the next big project of the alliance," he said, and the "real test of post-Madrid security thinking," he added, referring to the NATO summit meeting last July in which the alliance agreed to admit Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.
The Senate is expected to vote on that expansion this spring. Baltic membership would be much more contentious, and American officials have told the Baltic nations not to expect to be part of a second expansion in 1999. They have also been urged to do everything possible to solidify and stabilize their relations with Russia and to treat ethnic Russians within their boundaries with care and respect.
Russia's reaction to this charter has been "surprisingly low-key," American officials say. Moscow has urged the Baltic nations to adopt Finland's neutral stand, outside NATO, but the Baltic countries have rejected any limitation on their freedom to join any European security or cooperative organization.
The United States is urging the European Union to take in the Baltic nations as rapidly as possible to provide another form of "soft security," and Estonia is believed to be first in line for possible membership in the union before the turn of the century.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Treasuries Decline as Outlook for Asia Seems to Improve

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Bond prices fell sharply yesterday as the near-term outlook for Asia seemed to improve, the stock market rallied and there were new signs that the economy was strong as 1997 ended.
The yield on the 30-year bond, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, rose to 5.80 percent, from 5.74 percent Thursday, as the price fell 1 point, to 104 17/32. The yield on the 10-year note rose to 5.53 percent from 5.46, and the yields on shorter-term government securities also moved higher. Trading ended at 2 P.M. ahead of Martin Luther King Jr. Day on Monday. 
 If this pullback in yields holds, it could be disappointing for consumers who had seen mortgage interest rates fall to four-year lows earlier this week but hoped for further declines. According to The Bank Rate Monitor, the average rate nationally on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage dropped to 6.87 percent this week while the rate on a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 6.49 percent.
But since hitting recent lows on Monday, the yield on the 30-year bond has jumped from 5.69 percent and the 10-year yield, which is the key rate for mortgages, has risen from 5.36 percent.
Robert Heady, the publisher of The Bank Rate Monitor, said that if yields held at yesterday's level, mortgage rates should rise a little when he does his weekly survey on Wednesday. Mr. Heady says that rates are so low now that if all other aspects of the mortgage are favorable it is probably better to lock in a rate than "to play Las Vegas."
Analysts and traders, however, think that the selloff yesterday was just a blip in a trend that should continue to push interest rates lower.
"To me today's movement simply shows that the market got a little ahead of itself," said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management.
Matthew F. Alexy, chief market strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston, said, "We started the week way over the top." But, he added, "this does not mean we are not going to have any more rally." He said that the shortened trading day and Monday's holiday added to selling as traders worked to leave themselves less exposed over the long weekend.
The bond market got its big assist last week from the apparent worsening in the outlook for Asia as the Government of Indonesia seemed unwilling to put into effect the economic measures required as part of its $40 billion international bailout. Much of the buying, traders said, was from foreigners seeking a haven in the American market.
But this week the outlook changed, with President Suharto of Indonesia signing a new accord with the International Monetary Fund on Thursday. The fall of the dollar this week against the yen indicated that some of this foreign buying might be reversing.
Asian stock markets also rebounded, including a 6.11 percent surge in Japan and a 6.89 percent jump in Indonesia yesterday. But this optimism could reverse quickly. The selloff in Asia in the first week of the year followed a December where things were looking better.
Mr. Fine said that investors had pushed long-term yields to near 30-year lows and short-term yields to below the Federal Reserve's 5.5 percent target for the overnight Federal funds rate because they see low inflation continuing and they expect the drag from Asia to slow growth here and curb prices even further.
But he said that some investors might also be betting that the Asian drag on the American economy would force the Federal Reserve to cut its short-term interest rate target soon. That hope, he said, may be being reassessed right now, a fact reflected by the jump in the yield of the two-year note, which fell as low as 5.02 percent during trading Monday but ended yesterday at 5.33 percent.
One reason for this, Mr. Fine said, is that the economy has not yet shown any significant sign of slowing from the nearly 4 percent pace of growth last year, although a slowdown is the consensus for 1998.
The Federal Reserve's report on December industrial production yesterday showed a jump of five-tenths of a percent last month and an increase of 5 percent for the year, the strongest performance since 1994. The report showed that American factories were operating at the highest capacity since September 1995.
At the same time, people who have seen the early January University of Michigan consumer sentiment index said it had jumped to 104, compared with a final December reading of 102.1. The Michigan report is released only to subscribers.

HEADLINE: San Simeon Resort Plan Rejected

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 16

 BODY:
The California Coastal Commission has rejected a plan that would have let the Hearst Corporation build a 650-room resort on land surrounding Hearst Castle State Park at San Simeon, instead approving a scaled-down 375-room project that the company contends would be economically unfeasible.
The Hearst proposal, for land the company owns, was part of a broader coastal plan by San Luis Obispo County that the commission unanimously rejected late Thursday. That plan now goes back to the county, which has six months to respond, and Hearst has vowed to fight on for a the bigger project. 
 Environmental groups were bitterly opposed to the Hearst plan, which includes a proposal for a 27-hole golf course and a dude ranch, saying it would waste scarce water, block ocean views and impede public access to one of the last stretches of undeveloped coastline in the state. Some local groups supported the plan as a spur to economic development.
The coastal commission staff had rejected the plan as too big, and after a daylong hearing that drew hundreds of people in San Luis Obispo, the commission agreed by a vote of 9 to 3 that the project should go forward only if it was greatly scaled down and the golf course eliminated.
If the county and the commission cannot reach agreement on a new coastal plan for the region, the current plan, passed in the early 1980's, remains in effect. That zoning plan would allow for the bigger resort, but commission staff members and environmental groups say that changes in environmental standards and growth in the region since then make it unlikely that Hearst could ever obtain the necessary permits from the commission to build the resort.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Surge in Asian Stocks Buoys Markets in Europe and U.S.

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
Asia led the way. Then came Europe and the United States.
Global stock markets rallied yesterday after the Japanese Government backed a plan that many investors believe will stimulate its economy and help ease concerns about the Asia crisis. 
 Although much of Asia remains mired in financial and economic problems, optimism sent stock prices soaring in Japan, Hong Kong and elsewhere in the region.
The Nikkei 225 average, the main Japanese stock index, jumped 6.1 percent to its highest level in nearly a month. The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong, one of the bellwether stock indexes in the Pacific Rim, gained nearly 4 percent.
Those gains helped push stock prices higher in much of Europe, and later in the United States.
"Asia drove stock prices today," H. Vernon Winters, the chief investment officer at Mellon Private Asset Management in Boston, said. "You saw it span across the world, from Asia to Europe and then here."
It has been that way for some time now. Events in Asia set the tone for trading in the rest of the world.
Many of the world's largest governments and the International Monetary Fund have mobilized to contain the damage from Asia's currency and financial crisis, which began in Thailand last summer and spread. But much of the world is bracing for a slowdown that could hurt corporate profits and stock prices.
While the United States economy remains robust, bullish investors have been in retreat for months, while bearish types forecast the end of one of the greatest bull markets of all time.
What impact the Asian crisis will have on United States profits remains unclear. But this week at least, strong earnings from several technology companies helped the market recover from a sharp selloff last week.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 7,753.55 yesterday, up 61.78 for the day. For the week, the blue-chip average rose 173.13 points points, or 2.3 percent, recovering about half its loss the week before, the worst weekly setback since 1989.
Broader measures also gained yesterday. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 10.78, to 961.51, and the Nasdaq composite gained 15.82, to 1,562.88.
The market may have been lifted by more evidence that the United States economy remains strong. The Government said industrial production rose in December for the 14th consecutive month and factories operated at their highest rate since September 1995.
Many on Wall Street believe that the strength of the American economy will cushion corporations affected by slower growth abroad.
But investors still do not know how to interpret events in Asia. For seven months now, the Dow average and other stock market indexes have advanced little. The Dow accumulated most of 1997's spectacular overall gain during the first half of the year.
"If you go back to July, that's where we got the first news about Thailand," Larry Rice, chief investment officer at Josephthal Lyon & Ross, said. "And since then, we've been whipped around."
The main fear is that earnings will suffer as exports to Asia decline and cheaper imports from Asia force American companies to lower prices, cutting profit margins.
Barbara Marcin, a strategist at Citibank Global Asset Management, said that until investors get through fourth-quarter earnings and have more guidance on Asia's impact, it will be difficult for the market to advance. Even then, she said, prospects for a strong 1998 are doubtful.
"We might see a 5 or 10 percent gain in the stock market this year, she said. "But after three spectacular years, you're probably not going to get another stellar year."

HEADLINE: Congeniality And Unease As Wall St. Addresses Race

BYLINE: By PETER TRUELL 

 BODY:
There was something for everyone at this week's Wall Street conference organized by the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson and his Rainbow/PUSH coalition.
The meeting -- with its star-studded cast that included President Clinton and Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve -- offered Mr. Jackson and his organization an opportunity to generate headlines again while raising tough questions about why black Americans and other minorities have had so little access to investment capital, financial training and well-paying jobs. 
 And with affirmative action under increasing assault in the political arena and in the courts, business may actually be a friendlier forum these days for Mr. Jackson to practice his patented blend of uplift and agitation. Hobnobbing with the country's financial titans did not hurt Mr. Jackson's image, either.
"You raised my stock, thank you very much," Mr. Jackson half-jokingly told Mr. Greenspan after the Fed chairman addressed the conference. He did more than that. The meeting also provided Mr. Jackson and Rainbow/PUSH with an opportunity to raise tens of thousands of dollars from Wall Street's bulging pockets.
Mr. Jackson would not say exactly how much money had been raised by this week's event, although he said that the event's sponsors, which included big Wall Street firms like Merrill Lynch and the Salomon Smith Barney subsidiary of Travelers Group, had provided $400,000 "in round figures" to help cover the cost.
Rainbow/PUSH also held a fund-raiser Thursday night on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, with about 450 guests paying $500 each for dinner and entertainment by the singer Roberta Flack. Mr. Jackson declined to say how much that event had raised, explaining that not all the costs had been calculated. He also raised money yesterday at a $350-a-head luncheon.
But beyond the coffers filled, is anything likely to change as a result of the sessions, which combined 1960's-style consciousness-raising with a hardheaded 1990's focus on the bottom line?
For the middle-aged white men who run most Wall Street firms, the two-day gathering at the World Trade Center in downtown Manhattan that ended late yesterday offered an opportunity to pay lip service to minority hiring and to wear their hearts on their sleeves before a basically sympathetic audience.
After all, critics said, Wall Street has plenty of explaining to do: Blacks now account for no more than 600 of the country's 90,000 brokers, according to Tony Chapelle, publisher of Securities Pro newsletter, which reports on blacks on Wall Street. The percentage of employees in the securities industry who are black has dropped from 10.6 percent in 1990 to 8.4 percent in 1996. And nearly three out of five blacks on Wall Street are employed as office and clerical workers, according to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
The conference exposed a clear divide on Wall Street. In general, firms with lots of ordinary customers seemed to take the conference more seriously. Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover both contributed to the event, officials said, and senior executives from each firm attended.
But firms that deal little with the investing public, like Lehman Brothers, seemed less involved. William Ahearn, a Lehman spokesman, said this week that the firm had "at least one person attending," but was not supporting the event with a donation or providing speakers for any of the industry panels.
Asked what he had achieved at the conference, Mr. Jackson gave a discursive answer, setting out the grim economic history of the country's black population. "For 250 years blacks were listed as commodities," he said.
"There are these definable, quantifiable gaps in our economy," he said, adding that the conference had helped to draw attention to "the investment gap, the education gap and the trade gap in our economy."
"Wall Street stands to gain if it closes the gap," he said.
In interviews, Mr. Jackson and his staff insisted yesterday that they would continue to keep a close eye on Wall Street, and that their newfound closeness with the securities industry would be characterized by "tough love," combining friendship and criticism.
At some firms, Mr. Jackson's carrot approach appears to be having some effect. James Dimon, the chairman and chief executive of Salomon Smith Barney, has told managers for the last two years that they will be rewarded financially if they succeed in hiring good minority and women candidates, according to Gordon McAndrew, a spokesman for the firm.
But the stick may prove even more effective. Smith Barney settled a class action suit brought by women and minority employees in part by pledging to do more to safeguard their rights. A resolution to a similar suit brought against Merrill Lynch is currently being negotiated.
Mr. Jackson, when asked about the cases, replied with a broad statement offering few specific suggestions.
As for the black business leaders among the 650 people in attendance, the meeting was a chance to do more than exchange business cards. "It's bringing people together to focus on the task at hand," said Kenneth I. Tatum of Mitchell & Titus L.L.P., an accounting and consulting firm. That task, he said, is to "insure that minorities get to share opportunities" in fast-growth sectors of the economy like finance, software and high technology.

HEADLINE: Happy Days Are Here Again (At Least Until After Fall)

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 16

 BODY:
Erskine B. Bowles, the White House chief of staff, and two of his top aides braved a sleet storm in Washington on Thursday morning, traveling to Capitol Hill to pay a call on Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House Democratic leader, with whom President Clinton has had an often testy relationship.
On Wednesday, the President and Mr. Gephardt appeared together smiling at a White House photo opportunity. On Saturday, Mr. Gephardt and his wife, Jane, will have a private dinner with Al and Tipper Gore at the Vice President's mansion. Mr. Gephardt, an expected challenger to Mr. Gore for the 2000 Democratic Presidential nomination, will presumably check his weapons at the gate. 
 Mr. Clinton, Mr. Gore and Mr. Gephardt, all making nice? What's going on?
Ordinarily such contacts between Government leaders of the same party to discuss political and legislative strategy would be of little moment. But Mr. Clinton's relations with his fellow Democrats have never been quite ordinary.
Just last month, Mr. Gephardt, speaking for many of his Democratic colleagues in Congress, accused the President of conducting a Government of timid ideas and neglecting the nation's major challenges.
"We need a Democratic Party that is a movement for change and a movement for values, and not a money machine," Mr. Gephardt said at Harvard on Dec. 2, in an address that infuriated the White House.
Mr. Gephardt's speech marked a new low in a relationship that had already veered from mutual suspicion to open hostility. It was delivered three weeks after House Democrats had dealt Mr. Clinton a humiliating defeat over a measure that would have expanded his ability to negotiate trade agreements.
But today all appears rosy between Mr. Clinton and his fellow Democrats, as they join arms in public displays of unity on a political agenda for the coming year.
"The love fest continues," said a senior Democratic Congressional aide.
"Just one big happy family," chirped a top White House official.
Has this marriage been saved?
Perhaps -- for now.
There are a number of reasons for the new civility among Democrats, including a realization that division and pre-Presidential-campaign jockeying would hurt the party's efforts to regain the House in the elections this year.
The White House has made concerted efforts to appease Mr. Gephardt, both on a personal level and in policy proposals intended to appeal to Democratic officials and voters.
In recent weeks, Mr. Clinton has announced initiatives that sound much like traditional Democratic something-for-everyone interest-group politics: more spending on child day care for working mothers, expansion of Medicare to younger beneficiaries, a big school-construction program and a plan to train thousands more teachers, endorsement of Jesse Jackson's plea to Wall Street to hire more women and members of minority groups, a $5 billion program of grants and tax credits to address global warming and a $4 billion package for workers displaced by foreign trade.
"If you look at what Mr. Gephardt said in his speech, he was raising many of the issues that are beginning to be addressed in the President's agenda," said Laura Nichols, Mr. Gephardt's director of communications.
White House officials dispute that the President's proposals were intended to cater to Mr. Gephardt and the liberal wing of the Democratic Party. The ideas, they say, were entirely consistent with what they call Mr. Clinton's fiscally responsible "new Democrat" philosophy.
"The Gephardt speech was a catalyst for everyone realizing that it was in all of our interests to find things we can work together on," said John Podesta, deputy White House chief of staff.
"That speech obviously rubbed us the wrong way," Mr. Podesta added, "but the President said that if we work together there are a number of things we can accomplish, like electing more Democrats to the House and Senate. After that, most of the tension melted away."
Still, a reservoir of mistrust remains among many Democrats.
Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of New York, said Mr. Clinton's embarrassment on the "fast track" trade legislation "got the President's attention."
"His post-fast-track speeches have been terrific," Mr. Rangel said. "He's starting to address the problems of Americans who are outside the economic loop."
But, Mr. Rangel said, he is not entirely convinced that Mr. Clinton is committed to pursuing policies that will help the Congressman's urban constituents.
Richard Bond, former Republican national chairman, said the White House had panicked after Mr. Gephardt's Harvard speech, concerned that Presidential politics would undermine Mr. Clinton's ability to pursue any agenda in 1998.
"The post-Clinton wars were about to seriously break out," Mr. Bond said. "But Clinton has now bought himself some time by making nice with Gephardt in social terms and making nice with the left wing of the Democratic Party in policy terms by these extensions of the dependency culture that they favor."
White House realists expect the truce to be only temporary, lasting until perhaps the day after the November elections.
And if the Democrats lose seats in Congress or statehouses -- a common off-year experience of the party that holds the White House -- lesser officeholders are sure to blame the President, as they did after the Republican sweep of 1994.
Even if the marriage hangs together through the year, said one senior White House political aide, "things will get a lot more complicated in 1999."

HEADLINE: Texas Tobacco Deal Is Approved

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex., Jan. 16

 BODY:
A Federal judge today approved a $15.3 billion deal that settles a lawsuit by Texas against the tobacco industry for by far the greatest settlement the industry has reached with a state.
The money, to be paid over 25 years, includes an initial $725 million and another $264 million to fund state research and anti-smoking initiatives for youths, according to the industry. Earlier figures that placed the value of the settlement at about $14.5 billion failed to include the upfront payments of about $725 million. 
 The settlement is subject to change, depending on inflation and sales volume.
Lawyers for cigarette companies and the state met with Judge David Folsom of Federal District Court in Texarkana, Tex., for about six hours today to put the finishing touches on a deal reached on Thursday.
"We have a settlement," said Ron Dusek, a spokesman for the Texas Attorney General, Dan Morales. "It is done."
Judge Folsom is expected to sign the documents on Tuesday.
One issue that appeared to remain unresolved was how much money the lawyers who negotiated the deal for the state would receive. The state on Friday filed four motions asking the judge to arbitrate the fees. The lawyers had been promised a 15 percent cut of a jury award.
The deal is by far the largest of the three settlements the industry has made with states, coming close to the combined $14.4 billion negotiated with Florida and Mississippi last year.
Texas had sued eight tobacco companies and three trade groups for reimbursement of about $8.6 billion in Medicaid money spent on Texans' smoking-related illnesses dating to 1968. With damages, the lawsuit grew to more than $14 billion.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Indonesian Currency Continues Slide Despite I.M.F. Deal

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, Jan. 16

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund got virtually everything it wanted from President Suharto. Yet today, one day after he reluctantly agreed to a major restructuring of Indonesia's economy, its weakened currency resumed sliding.
The international marketplace, which has become the de facto arbiter of Indonesia's economic policies, still seemed dissatisfied. The risks and uncertainties, several financial analysts said, remained too great. 
 The currency ended the day at 8,450 rupiah to the dollar -- 6.5 percent lower than when the economic package was announced. Earlier today it dipped as low as 9,000 to the dollar, near the level that had set off panic buying last week.
That panic has eased, but confidence in the long-term future does not yet appear restored.
Even Robert E. Rubin, the United States Treasury Secretary, acknowledged today that the I.M.F.-backed reform packages for Asia offer no guarantees of success. He also offered no predictions on how long the crisis would last. "I don't have a crystal ball," he said in an interview on "The Newshour With Jim Lehrer" on public television in the United States.
Crippling private debt is still dragging down Indonesia's economy. Its political future remains tenuous and potentially chaotic.
"I'm sure the I.M.F. and the World Bank stood up from the table rubbing their hands with glee: this was their wish list," said Daragh Maher, an Indonesia specialist with ING Barings in Singapore. "But at the end of the day, Indonesia has a chronic foreign debt problem, and there was nothing offered in the package that would suggest that that would be any easier to manage."
Indonesia's stock market rose 6.9 percent today, but it was not a reliable indicator of confidence. The market is now so thinly traded that small movements can have a disproportionate effect.
If the rupiah's value erodes further, the country's burden of about $65 billion in dollar-denominated foreign debt would keep swelling, pushing more companies toward default and slowing the economy still more.
It is as if the formerly fast-growing nation of 200 million people, one of Southeast Asia's "tiger economies," was under "a billion pounds of weight," said Rajeev Malik, an economist for Jardine Fleming in Singapore. "It will certainly have a difficult time behaving like a tiger."
Worries were compounded by an impending fuel-price rise caused by Mr. Suharto's agreement to end subsidies, and by new predictions contained in the Thursday agreement of zero growth and 20 percent inflation.
Mr. Suharto received encouragement from the United States, which along with other nations had pressed him to agree to the I.M.F.'s terms.
President Clinton telephoned him a second time, and Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, who was in Jakarta earlier this week, said the announcement had increased Indonesia's stability.
Success in restoring the country's economic health is crucial now to Mr. Suharto's political future.
The crisis has intensified dissatisfaction with his 32-year rule, and the political tension is rising in advance of his expected reanointment as President in March.
Even as public demands for his resignation have increased over the last week, Mr. Suharto has made no provision for an orderly transfer of power. Even if he stays on, investors are likely to remain nervous.
At the same time, the country is bracing for social unrest as the economic slowdown, along with the newly announced austerity measures, lead to rising prices and joblessness.
For many Indonesians, who, like Kremlinologists, have become expert in reading their enigmatic leader's moods, Mr. Suharto failed to restore confidence in his leadership.
"This is an old fox," said one Indonesian political analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity. "If he's in a corner, he says to everyone, 'Yes.' Then when he's out of the corner he goes back to doing everything his own way."
For four months, after agreeing to a $40 billion rescue package organized by the I.M.F., Mr. Suharto dodged and ducked, resisting prescriptions that attacked the heart of his family's financial empire and his grip on the country's economy.
But with the tumbling currency causing panic in the streets and his back against the wall as the New Year began, Mr. Suharto capitulated to the I.M.F. He agreed to dismantle monopolies, halt inefficient projects, release the market from price controls, lift trade restrictions and reduce the national budget.
"It's quite impressive," said Donald Emmerson, an Indonesia expert and professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who was in Jakarta today. "One has to be encouraged but still skeptical about follow-through. I think the markets are saying, 'Show me the money.' "

Optimistic Signs in Japan
Global stock markets rallied yesterday after the Japanese Government backed a plan that many investors believed would stimulate its economy and help ease concerns about the Asia crisis. 

 The Nikkei 225 average, the main Japanese stock index, jumped 6.1 percent to its highest level in nearly a month. That helped spread some optimism to other parts of Asia as well as Europe and the United States, where the Dow Jones industrial average finished the week with a 2.3 percent gain, recovering about half its losses a week earlier. Page D4.
 
Japan's governing party proposed accounting changes that would allow banks to vastly increase their dwindling capital and enable them to grant more loans. D3.
 
Adam Smith Goes to Asia
Among the humbled tiger economies of Asia, the form of capitalism that emphasized government planning and long-term relationships is now viewed as the problem, not the solution. Businesses are reluctantly adopting elements of the free-market, Adam Smith brand of capitalism practiced in the United States, despite its harsh consequences of layoffs and bankruptcies. A1.
 
China's central bank governor disclosed a sweeping reorganization of the banking system to make it more professional and help insulate the nation from financial upheavals in neighboring Asian countries. The overhaul resembles the Federal Reserve system in the United States. D3.
 
Fed Data Depict Industrial Vibrance
Industrial production increased half a percent in December, the 14th consecutive monthly gain, and factories operated at their highest level since September 1995, the Federal Reserve said. The data reinforced a view that the United States can withstand any harm from Asia's crisis. D16.
 
Bond prices fell sharply on the new signs of U.S. economic strength, the apparent improvement in Asia's outlook and the rally in stocks. The 30-year Treasury yield rose to 5.80 percent from 5.74. D4.
 
Deal Seen for Movie Theater Chain
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., one of the biggest investment firms that specialize in buying other companies, is said to be in talks to buy Regal Cinemas Inc. for more than $1 billion. It would be the firm's second acquisition in the movie theater business in two months. D4.

Haircut Time

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin better hurt somebody fast. Citibank would do. Or maybe his old partners at Goldman Sachs. Or maybe his old competitors at J. P. Morgan. Or better yet, all of them. But he better hurt somebody, fast.
Because if Mr. Rubin can't show that as part of the U.S.-led I.M.F. bailout of Korea, Indonesia and Thailand, the U.S., European and Japanese banks that lent these countries money won't also pay a price for their mistakes, he can forget about getting any more money out of Congress for the I.M.F. Forget it. Congress returns next week, and you can already hear the tom-toms beating: "No More Money For The I.M.F. Let The Asians Go Bust." 
 Mr. Rubin needs to do two things if he wants to save U.S. funding for the $40 billion I.M.F. bailout: He needs to speak to America and draw blood on Wall Street. He needs to explain to Americans precisely why the Asian bailout is valid. And he needs to make sure that any American bank that was involved in loans to Asia, and now wants to share in the I.M.F. bailout, takes a haircut. And I'm not just talking about a trim.
So far the Clinton team has failed miserably to make a convincing argument as to why the U.S. should make its overdue deposit to the I.M.F. -- $17.9 billion -- and why this won't end up as welfare for Asian tycoons and U.S. bankers. (Most Americans don't even realize that the I.M.F. is a credit union for countries. The U.S. doesn't "give" the I.M.F. anything. The U.S. deposits funds in the I.M.F. bank, and the I.M.F. pays the U.S. interest and then lends money to troubled economies.)
Consider Korea. Korea's private banks borrowed $92 billion from foreign banks. Those foreign banks are saying to Korea that they will extend the loans, to get the Koreans past the short-term debt crunch so they don't have to declare bankruptcy, but only on the condition that the Korean Government take over responsibility for that bank debt and pay it back with even higher interest over the long term. An I.M.F. loan now gives Korea the cushion to take the deal.
Opponents of such a workout argue that Korea is much better off letting private companies go bust and having them bought out or restructured by more prudent and efficient managers, and that the world is better off letting the foreign banks also get burned so they will be less reckless in the future. Those are not ridiculous arguments.
What U.S. officials mumble in response are two arguments. One is that the collapse of huge economies like South Korea or Indonesia could present a real national security problem for the U.S. Maybe.
The more compelling argument is the domino theory -- that if huge economies like Korea, Thailand and Indonesia are allowed to just go bankrupt, they will take down other emerging markets, from Asia to Latin America, and likely drag down Japan. And if the world's second-largest economy goes down, that will seriously impact U.S. interest rates and markets. And it won't just be Billionaire Bob who takes a hit, but also Joe Sixpack's pension fund, mutual fund and, maybe, job. Millions of workers in developing countries would also be ruined.
This domino argument may be exaggerated, but testing it by seeing what would happen if the Asian tigers were left to melt down would be the greatest roll of the dice of the post-cold-war era. It is reasonable that the U.S. Treasury Secretary wouldn't want to take that risk.
So what to do? The U.S. must insist that it will contribute to an I.M.F. bailout only if both borrowers and lenders being bailed out receive no more than 75 cents on the dollar for any money invested and lost. The U.S. also has to use its influence to try to insure that, in restructuring a country's debts, that country is not forced to pay exorbitant additional interest. The worst thing would be that the I.M.F. bails out a country and Western banks profit even more from their own mistakes.
It's a fine line. People need to be hurt, so they think twice in the future. But not killed, if there is a chance they can recover and grow again.
An I.M.F. bailout that makes reckless banks and investors whole again will never fly. An I.M.F. bailout that punishes both reckless banks and investors, but still leaves them some space and buys them some time to make real business and governance reforms, is both good economics and good politics.

HEADLINE: Horse Tracks Need Help In New Jersey, Panel Says

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY 

DATELINE: HACKENSACK, N.J., Jan. 16

 BODY:
After a year's study, a commission on New Jersey's slumping horse-racing industry urged the state government today to pump $25 million to $50 million a year into racetrack purses and to soften betting regulations so residents can place wagers by telephone, via the Internet or in a few new upscale off-track betting parlors.
The commission's report and recommendations were silent on the introduction of slot machines at the state's five tracks. And before the 19-member panel voted on the report in Trenton, it narrowly rebuffed two 11th-hour amendments to add slot machines to the list of proposed ways to lure more fans to the tracks. A coalition of panel members from the Whitman administration and two representatives of Atlantic City casinos, Donald J. Trump and Herbert R.Wolfe, the chief executive of the Atlantic City Showboat Casino Hotel, defeated the slot machine appeal. 
 Representatives of horse breeders and owners and three of the panel's four state legislators voted for the slots. The votes were 11 to 7 and 10 to 8. Gov. Christine Todd Whitman created the panel, the Racing Industry Study Commission, in December 1996 to explore ways to stop this decade's steep slide in betting and attendance, improve the quality of horses and races, and find ways to lure horse players back from Atlantic City casinos, the state lottery and tracks in Delaware, which introduced slot machines two years ago, and in Pennsylvania, which allows phone betting. Besides those problems, the panel's final report said the track faced possible increased competition for the gambling dollar from New York, noting that Gov. George E. Pataki is talking about allowing slot machines at New York tracks and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's administration is entertaining notions about a casino on Governors Island.
The report stressed that New Jersey's best answer to the competition in its neighboring states was higher purses for the owners of the top finishers in each race. It called higher purses the "pivotal economic component of the entire sport," saying they guaranteed better horses racing each day and more financially stable breeding farms.
The report offered no suggestions on the source of its proposed annual state subsidy of $25 million to $50 million. Panel officials said they were leaving it up to the Governor and the Legislature to find the money. Copies of the report went to both.
Governor Whitman's office had no immediate reaction to any of the recommendations. Gene Herman, a spokesman for the Governor, said the administration wanted to study them before commenting.
As for the proposals for phone and off-track betting, it will be several months before those ideas become reality, if at all. The types of gambling allowed on horse races are restricted by the State Constitution. Before the Legislature can consider them, voters must first approve them in a statewide referendum. Commission officials said such a vote could not come before next November. If voters accept them, they must then win legislative approval.
The commission's report criticized the restrictions and urged the Legislature to loosen them. Commission officials complained that the Legislature alone can change both the way the state lottery and casinos are run. But, they said, tracks suffer unfairly because of the requirements for statewide referendums on phone and off-track betting.
The report noted that New York State allows phone betting at its tracks and New Jersey horse players use the system, taking their dollar away from New Jersey's tracks.
The state's tracks have suffered from the outside competition. Total attendance last year, through November, was 2.7 million, down 1.1 million from the same 11-month period in 1993. In those same four years, on-track betting has fallen to $450 million from $831 million, the New Jersey Racing Commission said.
The commission questioned whether all five tracks could survive, especially the Atlantic City Racetrack and Garden State Park in Cherry Hill. It suggested using them as off-track betting theaters that would be operated by track owners and feature restaurants and other amenities. Southern New Jersey legislators, however, are expected to oppose any attempts to close Garden State Park. The slot machines at Delaware's tracks have pumped about $30 million a year into the tracks' purses in the last two years ago, the commission said.
But the commission rejected them for New Jersey. The panel's chairman, Candace Straight, a member of the state agency that operates the state's two biggest and busiest tracks, the Meadowlands and Monmouth Park, said the panel was not convinced that slot machines would increase on-track betting. In addition, she said, the commission did not believe that New Jersey voters or members of the Legislature favored expansion of casino-style gambling beyond Atlantic City.
The amendment rejected today by the 11-7 vote had recommended that the slots be introduced immediately. The one, rejected by the 10-8 vote, had proposed introducing slot machines to New Jersey's tracks if New York State permitted them at Aqueduct or Belmont. The sponsor, Senator Richard J. Codey, Democrat of West Orange, said slots at either track would leave New Jersey's tracks at a distinct disadvantage.
"If that became the case," he siad, "you could set off a bomb in the Meadowlands and not injure anyone because no one would be there."

HEADLINE: U.S. Can't Find Buyer for Jets Thailand Can No Longer Afford

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand, Jan. 16

 BODY:
Thailand's effort to back out of a contract to buy eight American-made F/A-18 fighter jets has run into a big problem: The United States does not want them back and is not likely to find anyone else to buy them any time soon.
At a meeting today with Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen, Thailand's Prime Minister, Chuan Leekpai, formally asked the United States to keep the F/A-18's or find another country willing to pick up the $392 million bill, a defense official traveling with Mr. Cohen said. 
 But that is easier said than done.
Despite assurances by Mr. Cohen that he would do all he could to help, the United States cannot just buy back the fighters, since this particular type of F/A-18 is made for export only, meaning the planes are incompatible with those already in the American arsenal.
Moreover, the defense official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it would be virtually impossible to find another buyer in time for Thailand to keep to its contract with the planes' manufacturer, Boeing Co., which includes a $100 million installment in March.
The few countries that have shown interest in buying F/A-18's in the past, like Malaysia, are suffering from the same economic turmoil that has forced Thailand to reconsider its purchase.
After his meeting with Mr. Chuan, who also serves as Defense Minister, Mr. Cohen announced that he would send a team of defense officials to Thailand in the next week to 10 days to begin talks about what to do next. Despite the Thai request, however, he suggested the solution would involve negotiations with Boeing to simply extend payment.
"We're talking to contractors, as I mentioned, to find ways in which perhaps payments could be spread out, payments deferred, ways in which we could accommodate their security needs while also recognizing their economic difficulties," Mr. Cohen said at a news conference at the Defense Ministry.
A Boeing official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said in a telephone interview that Boeing was prepared to support the United States in its talks with Thailand. But since Thailand technically purchased the planes directly from the United States and not Boeing, the official said, the matter remained one for the two Governments to settle.
If the Pentagon went ahead with Thailand's request, the United States could end up essentially negotiating against itself.
Mr. Cohen's visit today -- part of his 12-day, 7-nation tour of Asia -- was intended to shore up the United States' military and strategic ties with Thailand, which have been strained at times in recent years. But as the difficulties with the F/A-18's have showed, much of his mission has been overshadowed by the economic crises sweeping Southeast Asia.
"We know you are currently experiencing difficulties," Mr. Cohen said at the start of a meeting with the Foreign Minister, Surin Pitsuwan. "But we hope we can provide assistance and support in a variety of ways."
The F/A-18's are due to be delivered over eight months starting in early 1999.
Thailand has already paid $72 million of the $392 million price, but with the value of its currency collapsing by half since last summer and its spending constrained by the International Monetary Fund's $17 billion bailout, it has been hard pressed to pay for it and a host of other, smaller weapons purchases.

HEADLINE: COLLEGE FOOTBALL;
A Grateful Paterno Promises $3.5 Million to Penn State

BYLINE: By MALCOLM MORAN 

 BODY:
In a dramatic reversal of the economic relationship between universities and high-profile football coaches, Joe Paterno of Penn State, and his wife, Sue, have pledged $3.5 million to the school that has employed him since 1950.
The gift will pay for scholarships, faculty positions and the construction of an interfaith spiritual center and a sports hall of fame on the State College, Pa., campus. 
 "To the best of our knowledge, no college coach, at any university at any time in history, has made a gift at this level of generosity," said Graham B. Spanier, the university president.
Paterno, who turned 71 last month, said he and his wife had discussed making a major donation for 25 years.
"I make more money than I should make," he said. "They let me work, so, thanks."
The Paternos contributed $420,000 in past years toward construction of a library, a library acquisitions fund and the endowment of scholarships for minority students.
Their latest gift will endow professorships in the university libraries and the College of the Liberal Arts; a graduate fellowship and undergraduate scholarship in the School of Architecture and Landscape Architecture, plus a fellowship and a scholarship in the classics in the College of the Liberal Arts.
The spiritual center is planned as an extension of an existing chapel. The hall of fame will be built between Beaver Stadium and the Bryce Jordan Center.
"I find it truly remarkable that the Paternos would take a substantial portion of their life savings and return it to the university," Dr. Spanier said.
"Money has never been important to us," Sue Paterno said. "Material things have never been important to us. What is important to us is what the future of the world will be."
Sue Paterno had laughed and described the family as being "in the red." Joe Paterno sounded like someone who needed to hold a job for the next few years.
The Nittany Lions' coach, whose 298 victories are the most among active major college coaches, laughed at the idea.
"You hit that right on the head," Paterno said.
"The president is requiring it," Dr. Spanier said.

Mr. Chubais was removed from overseeing government media policy, but would retain considerable sway on economic policy. Mr. Chernomyrdin said he would assume oversight of the fuel and energy sectors from Mr. Nemtsov, a likely presidential contender who would be left with the politically unpopular issues of pension and housing reform.

The International Monetary Fund got virtually everything it wanted from President Suharto of Indonesia, yet one day after he reluctantly agreed to a major restructuring of his country's economy, Indonesia's weakened currency resumed sliding. The currency ended the day at 8,450 rupiah to the dollar -- 6.5 percent lower than when the economic package was announced on Thursday. D1

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Crisis Pushing Asian Capitalism Closer to U.S.-Style Free Market

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Jan. 16

 BODY:
Sitting in his office just off the factory floor, a week's stubble on his face and weariness in his eyes, Kim Jung Ju watches his workers carefully, figuring out whom he might lay off next.
"Now the bottom line is everything," Mr. Kim says mournfully, and he complains that the relationships that were the underpinning of Korean-style capitalism are dying quickly. "Before, companies that had done business with us for a decade would help us out in times of trouble. But no more." 
 So the customers of Mr. Kim's clothing factory are breaking the rules of the game by squeezing him and curbing orders. And he reacts by breaking the rules again and laying off one-third of his 130 employees.
That is the harsh reality of free-market capitalism, and it might be unremarkable in the United States. But this is Asia, where in the past some nations followed a different economic model, emphasizing not markets but rather Government planning and long-term relationships.
That version of capitalism, particularly the variety developed by Japan and adopted by South Korea, is now widely regarded as a problem rather than a solution. For the present at least, the Asian financial crisis is driving Governments and businesses alike toward a more open, market-oriented, laissez-faire version of capitalism, the kind championed by the United States.
While many aspects of East Asia's community ethos will remain, Asian officials and scholars suggest that the region's economies may emerge from the financial crisis looking a bit more like the American economy. In other words, they would be more open to imports and foreign investment, less curtailed by strict regulations, less dominated by Government planning and more ruthless about laying off workers.
"Everybody has been liberating markets to take advantage of globalization and the world economy," said Jusuf Wanandi, chairman of a policy research center in Jakarta, Indonesia. "So we are all moving more to the American model."
Still, as Mr. Wanandi noted, this does not mean that Asian countries will adopt the free model outright. Many Asians are still not on friendly terms with the market forces that over the last few months have demolished their economies, and they worry that an excess of markets will threaten a way of life and community ethos.
While the changes under way seem breathtaking to a laid-off Korean worker, they still leave the region looking -- to Western eyes -- far more Asian than American. Western commentators have been saying for generations that Asians are becoming "more like us," and while in one sense they were right, that does not mean that convergence lies ahead.
In any case, the change in the mood in Asia is striking because Japanese-style capitalism was perhaps the most formidable rival to neoclassical free-market capitalism as a model for other countries. Japanese officials vigorously urged other Asian nations to adopt the Japanese approach to capitalism, even sponsoring a 1993 World Bank report that was supposed to give the Japanese methods the seal of legitimacy. The report did not quite do that, but it was not as critical of state intervention as an earlier World Bank report.
To be sure, Asia as a whole never adopted a single economic model. Hong Kong was traditionally a paragon of laissez-faire capitalism. On the other hand, Japan and South Korea relied on a very similar system of industrial planning, huge inter-linked conglomerates, lifetime jobs in big companies, export assistance and protected domestic industries.
Taiwan, Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia were somewhere in-between, but all borrowed in part from the Japanese development model. Bureaucrats in all those countries sometimes seemed to think that they were better at allocating capital and goods than markets were.
"How can you go hunting without a target?" Naohiro Amaya, the late former top Japanese trade official and leading theorist of the Japanese model, was quoted as saying in 1988. "When you go hunting, you have to shoot at a target. But your neoclassical school of economics says you can fire in all directions at once, and the 'market' will insure you hit the target. Well, we don't accept that line of reasoning, and our economic model will probably be stronger in the future, and have a greater demonstration effect for developing countries, than either the American model, which has become weak and less relevant, or the Soviet central-command model."
The wheel may turn again, but for now there are no more boasts about the superiority of the Japanese-Korean model.
"Other Asian markets should take note and move their economies more in the direction of free market logic and away from government and bureaucratic intervention and centralized monopolistic industrial power blocs," warned the Chosun Ilbo, South Korea's leading newspaper. "If Asians have been arrogant, soaked in snobbish and boastful attitudes, then now is the time to realize their limitations and show a degree of humility and repentance."
These days, both Japan and Korea are trying to dismantle regulations and bureaucratic controls over the economy. "Economies are all going the American way, and that's a major trend today," Makoto Kuroda, a former top Japanese trade official and managing director of Mitsubishi Corporation, said.
 
Some Trends Under Way in Past
Still, Mr. Kuroda noted that there are countercurrents as well, and in any case the trend away from bureaucratic intervention is not a completely new one.
In Japan, the Government has been losing its ability to manipulate the economy, and layoffs have become more common in the last few years. Regulation is diminishing, and imports have risen, and those trends have been visible in South Korea and other Asian countries.
The Asian financial crisis has dramatically accelerated this process. While Asia has had crises in the past, like the oil crisis of 1973-74, that were in some ways more severe than the present one, those were external shocks. In contrast, this crisis seems more of a collapse from within, especially with Japan's long stagnation since 1990, and the problems raise fundamental questions about whether a new strategy is necessary.
"The model is now clear," said Lee Hong Koo, a member of the South Korean National Assembly and a former Prime Minister. "It's not Japan. It's the West."
"The current crisis has convinced almost all people that that the old style doesn't work," Mr. Lee added. "We will adjust ourselves rapidly to the new requirements, which means we will fashion ourselves more like the West, like the U.S. and European model."
Mr. Lee and others emphasize that they do not see the collapse of their development strategy as a defeat for Asia. On the contrary, they hope that freer markets may give the region a new dynamism.
"If we faithfully implement the reforms we agreed on with the I.M.F., we will emerge with a stronger economic foundation, and we will be poised to overtake Japan," said You Jong Keun, a top economic adviser to President-elect Kim Dae Jung of South Korea.
 
Several Changes Are Predicted
In the real world, a shift to a new model is never quite so clear-cut as it sounds, but in general the changes that diplomats and business executives are talking about are these:
*Governments may control economies less than before. The Finance Ministry in Korea no longer tells the banks whom to lend to, and the Finance Ministry in Japan has lost its capacity to determine the fate of banks and securities houses. As a result, despite official Japanese assurances that no big bank would be allowed to fail, one did in the fall.
*Labor markets may become a bit more flexible, and unemployment rates will rise. Lifetime employment and rigid seniority will tend to be less important, and layoffs will increase. This has been happening for years but will accelerate. South Korea's unemployment rate is expected to quadruple this year to 10 percent.
*Relationships in general may tend to become less important. The huge families of linked companies -- called keiretsu in Japan and chaebol in South Korea, where the ship-building arm buys its cars from the linked auto company and its beer from the linked brewery -- is gradually giving way to a more open system in which business is allocated not by loyalty but by price. Already, business groups in both countries are for the first time allowing affiliates to collapse, and Asia's great home-grown champion of relationship finance, Peregrine Securities in Hong Kong, collapsed this month.
*Companies may make less effort to build market share and more effort to make money. Japanese banks and South Korean chaebol alike are being ordered to disclose more accurate and useful financial information, and everyone is paying more attention to credit-worthiness.
 
Transition Apparent In Seoul Already
These changes are matters of degree, and even modest change will take time. But in Chung Youn Goo's small clothing factory in Seoul, the transition is already apparent. Mr. Chung has laid off a third of his work force, rather than keep them on in hopes for a rebound, as he would have done in the old days, and he is now scrutinizing data as much as cultivating relationships.
"Our methods of doing business have changed a lot," Mr. Chung said as he sat at a small table near the factory floor. "We put a lot more emphasis on making sure that we have confidence in the companies we deal with. For companies listed on the stock exchange, for example, we conduct a thorough review of their financial standing, because now even the big companies can go belly up very quickly."
The crisis is so recent that the changes in the way of doing business are tentative, and many still have not fully taken effect. But in South Korea, the chaebol have been forced to accept substantial changes by the markets and by President-elect Kim, who unlike other recent presidents owes the chaebol nothing.
On Thursday, the chaebol jointly promised to adopt Western accounting standards, to bring outsiders into their boards of directors and to reduce the cross-guarantees that subsidiaries make to honor one another's debts. They also pledged to reduce their debt-equity ratios to bring them closer to Western standards.
These measures are important because the top 30 chaebol account for nearly two-thirds of South Korea's economic output. That was the result of preferential treatment -- the Government ordered banks to lend to the chaebol, for instance -- and the ratio is expected to drop as South Korea becomes more market-oriented.
To be sure, while executives find themselves forced to embrace the market, that is not to say they find it a pretty sight. Dong Hwa International, a trading company, did some deals with the United States a few years ago, and its executives were angered when the American company promptly cut costs by dispensing with Dong Hwa and contacting the Korean end company directly.
That was shrewd but unethical, Dong Hwa executives say. Still, they see such moves as the way of the future.
"I think the Korean economy will look more like America's, because all parties here are trying to cut costs, cutting out third parties, cutting out middlemen," lamented Kim Jin Hyung, an executive of Dong Hwa.
 
Resembling America Only a Bit More
Yet Asia is not suddenly going to look like America. One way of looking at it is that young Japanese, Taiwanese, Koreans, Chinese and Thais already wear Western clothes, eat American hamburgers, watch American movies and listen to American music. Within a few years, they are much more likely also to face the risk of layoffs, and to change jobs with American-style casualness.
All this will make Asia's labor markets, finance and industry resemble America's a bit more, but Americans do not become more group-oriented or respectful of their parents when they put on a Sony Walkman.
Japan is still the country that is most hesitant about rapid change toward a more market-driven system, with Japanese wary of the brutality of market mechanisms. The old system protected a way of life that is often inefficient -- with the tiny rice shops and futon-makers that charge ludicrous prices -- but that is also central to the ethos of Japan. A more efficient, market-driven system may mean better prices and more supermarkets, but the fear is that it will also lead to alienation, crime and an end to the civility that is the most outstanding feature of daily Japanese life.
The result is a profound ambivalence that has Japan tip-toeing toward a freer market system but still aghast at the layoffs and turbulence that a radical economic restructuring will require.
"Markets are riddled with defects," the Yomiuri Shimbun, the largest circulation newspaper in Japan, complained in an editorial. "Markets widen the rich-poor gap and raise unemployment, putting the nation's entire social fabric at risk."
Yet the newspaper acknowledged, just a bit sadly, that "the move toward markets has reached the point of no return."

HEADLINE: Tough Sanctions Can Halt Trafficking in Humans;
Why Russians Leave

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Traffickers' New Cargo: Naive Slavic Women" (front page, Jan. 11): 
 While it is true that unemployment rates (as high as 95 percent for women in some parts of Russia) are driving women out of the country, it is not the only reason why women are desperate to leave Russia.
Most women who do find employment are forced to work menial jobs. On average, they make half as much as men. Fifty-five percent of households headed by single mothers have incomes below the poverty level. In some cases, women who have answered job listings have been told they will have to sleep with their employers and follow a dress code of miniskirts and tight shirts.
Because of poor economic conditions, violence against women is also on the rise. Every fifth murder is someone killed by a spouse, and the majority of victims are women. Victims of domestic violence and rape have little recourse; domestic abuse is considered a "family affair." Instead of labeling as "naive" the women who leave in hopes of something better for themselves, you should consider the problem as it really is: a serious human rights issue.

HEADLINE: TURKS' HIGH COURT ORDERS DISBANDING OF ISLAMIC PARTY

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER 

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, Turkey, Jan. 16

 BODY:
Turkey's highest court placed an immediate ban on the country's largest political party today, ruling that it harbored a subversive agenda and was working to replace the nation's secular order with one based on Islam.
"This court has decided to close the Welfare Party because of evidence confirming its actions against the principles of the secular republic," Ahmet Necdet Sezer, Chief Judge of the Constitutional Court, said in announcing the ruling. 
 The court also ruled that seven leaders of the party would be barred from political activity for five years. Among them is the party leader, Necmettin Erbakan, 71, who was Prime Minister from June 1996 until June 1997. Six, including Mr. Erbakan, are currently members of Parliament, and the seventh is a mayor.
Today, Mr. Erbakan urged his supporters to remain calm and ignore "provocateurs who might want to take advantage of this situation." He said he would appeal the decision to the European Court of Human Rights.
A leading young figure in the party, Abdullah Gul, called the decision "a shadow on Turkish democracy."
"We are the mainstream and backbone of this country," Mr. Gul said. "A large part of the population supports us. In a democratic society, this group must be represented. We will have another political party."
Some Turkish secularists hailed the decision, but many foreigners, including those who consider themselves friends of Turkey, said it would hinder the country's efforts to portray itself as a fully functioning democracy.
The United States and several countries in the European Union had urged the Government to do whatever was possible to prevent a decision like the one handed down today. After the ruling was announced, the British Embassy in Ankara issued a statement saying, "We are concerned with the implications for democratic pluralism and freedom of expression, and will be discussing the closure of Welfare urgently with our E.U. partners."
There have also been predictions that the decision could radicalize at least some supporters of political Islam and perhaps even drive them to violence. In anticipation of a violent reaction, the police in Ankara and Istanbul strengthened patrols around mosques and Welfare Party offices, but no disturbances were reported today. Friday prayers proceeded normally.
In making its decision, the court acted under a series of laws, including one that prohibits efforts "to change the secular character of the Turkish Republic" and another that bans political parties from seeking political advantage "through the use or misuse of religion or religious beliefs."
Turkey's Constitution defines secularism as one of the nation's basic principles and forbids repeal, or even discussion of repealing, that definition.
Military commanders and other secularists say these restrictions are necessary to preserve what they describe as the world's only Muslim democracy. Others believe that they limit voters' rights to choose the future they want for their country and themselves.
Today's ruling was based in part on public statements by Welfare Party leaders that the prosecutor submitted as proof of what he called the party's subversive agenda.
Among the statements were Mr. Erbakan's assertion that democracy "is not an end but a means for us." The court also heard a tape of another Welfare Party leader, Oguzhan Asilturk, saying, "The order we shall bring has a big difference, as big as mountains, from the secularist and democratic order. Ours is on the mountaintop, and democracy is in the abyss."
The party did not deny that such statements had been made, but it said it could not be responsible for the public statements of "all our four million members."
There has been talk of starting a new party from the ashes of the Welfare Party or adopting a minor party, but politicians say no firm decision has been made. In its waning days, the party took the precaution of divesting itself of cars and other material assets, giving them to prominent members for fear that the assets might be seized by the Government. The ruling did not include any freezing of party assets.
Some news commentators predicted that today's decision would marginalize pro-Islamic forces and usher in an era of political stability. Others asserted that former Welfare leaders would portray themselves as outsiders victimized by an undemocratic attack and that any new party they formed could turn out to be even stronger than Welfare was.
The prosecutor who presented the case against Welfare, Vural Savas, said any new Islamic-oriented party "will be subjected to investigation on whether it is a continuation of the banned party."
Mr. Savas said Welfare leaders were working to "destroy the Turkish Republic" and "establish a state based on religious principles."
"The assumption that political parties cannot be closed in democratic regimes is not correct," Mr. Savas asserted. "The Turkish Constitution accepts the understanding of 'combative democracy,' which permits the closure of political parties if their programs or activities threaten the existence of the state."
In a 275-page reply, the Welfare Party called Mr. Savas "prejudiced and intolerant of everything related to Islam" and described his charges as baseless and demagogic.
"It is also a sociological fact that closing a party does not and cannot change the minds of people," the party asserted in its defense. "People can only change their thoughts if they are given better alternatives."
Welfare emerged as a significant political force in the late 1980's, when it began winning control of local governments. Its success in smaller communities led voters to give it control of several large cities, including Istanbul and Ankara. In the 1995 national election, it won 21 percent of the vote, more than any other party. It holds 150 of the 550 seats in Parliament.
Although the party has been dissolved, officeholders elected under its banner will retain their positions but will be considered independent of party affiliation.
Within weeks after the Welfare-led Government took office in June 1996, it began taking steps that angered the secular establishment. Mr. Erbakan made official visits to Iran and Libya, effusively embracing their leaders. He received leaders of Muslim brotherhoods, dressed in traditional robes that are anathema to secularists here, for a religious dinner at his official residence.
Later he began placing Islamic allies in important bureaucratic posts and encouraging families to send their children to religious schools and women to wear head scarves. He announced plans to build a mosque in Taksim Square, the secular heart of Istanbul, and Cankaya, the section of Ankara where the Presidential Palace is located.
These and other steps alarmed top military leaders, who consider themselves the ultimate guardians of Turkish secularism. Supported by allies in the press, they began portraying Mr. Erbakan as a deceitful plotter whose secret agenda was to turn Turkey into an Islamic state.
For their part, Welfare leaders insisted that they were acting within democratic rules. In their written defense before the Constitutional Court, they declared that they were "against any sort of religious or political fanaticism" and "on the side of pluralist democracy, reconciliation and tolerance."
Military commanders scoffed at such assertions, calling them part of Welfare's duplicity. They finally brought down the Government with a series of "briefings" for the press, business figures, judges and bureaucrats in which they portrayed Welfare as hostile to all that Turks should hold dear. Mr. Erbakan, understanding that he could not govern in the face of such direct opposition from the military, stepped down on June 18.
One American scholar who has closely studied the Welfare Party, Jenny B. White of Boston University, wrote before today's ban that the party's "ultimate direction is still unclear."
"Despite Welfare's pragmatism and modern image, there is concern that more radical religious zealots are riding into power on its coattails," Ms. White wrote. "Erbakan may be the head of an Islamist political party, but many Turks wonder what the rest of the body looks like."

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Washington Criticizes Ruling
 WASHINGTON, Jan. 16 (By The New York Times) -- The United States criticized Turkey's courts today for banning the Welfare Party, saying the decision "damages confidence in Turkey's democratic, multiparty system."
The State Department spokesman, James P. Rubin, said the United States would not interfere in the internal affairs of its NATO allies or support any particular political party.
John Shattuck, the Assistant Secretary of State for human rights, will go forward with a planned visit to Turkey next month despite the ruling, Mr. Rubin said, adding, "One of the things that he will obviously make clear is that Americans, as a democracy, will have difficulty understanding and reconciling this action with our concept of democracy."
"Despite this troubling development of this banning of the party," Mr. Rubin concluded, "we do have confidence in Turkey's future as a democracy, and our view is that the challenges that Turkey faces will be resolved by more democracy rather than less."

To Whom It May Concern

BYLINE: By Max Frankel 

 BODY:
A "committee of concerned journalists" wants my signature on a "Statement of Concern." It says that technology, economics and "our relationship with the public" have produced a crisis "pulling journalism from its traditional moorings." Because I, too, feel intimidated by quirky computers, greedy stockholders and fickle readers, I reach for my pen.
Then I read on: "Many journalists feel a sense of lost purpose. There is even doubt about the meaning of news, doubt evident when serious journalistic organizations drift toward opinion, infotainment and sensation out of balance with the news." 
 Now I must reflect. Yes, I have had doubts about the meaning of news. But my doubts gave me purpose; as an editor, I was well paid to entertain them. With less than 200,000 words in the weekday Times to encompass the world, deciding what's news and what isn't proved to be a fascinating struggle. I never resolved my doubts because my definition of news became highly volatile, of little practical help.
My only verity is that news must be new. News is not a rendering of reality, only a quest for novelty.
Novel for whom? Here the trouble starts. To an audience of 8-year-olds, the multiplication table might qualify as news. In The Times, which assumes readers to be at least 12, math gets ink only when it solves Fermat's last theorem. Embedded in the minds of all journalists is the image of a prototypical consumer of their news.
I defined my readers by geography and ideology as well as chronology. I wrote and edited with a bias for the home team, the Yanks in the cold war and the Yankees in the World Series. But when New York quarreled with New Jersey or the Yankees played the Mets, I became neutral; I qualified for Victor Navasky's taunt that The Times preaches "the ideology of the center, which includes a denial that it has an ideology."
Besides being new and fitfully neutral, my news needs to be important or interesting, preferably both. This leads into a realm that the Committee of the Concerned might disparage as mere opinion. For example, given the autobiographical nature of most Woody Allen films, I bet that his latest marriage, though it surely qualifies as "infotainment," will turn out to be important to his art. For me, therefore, his romance is news. So are Seymour Hersh's "sensations" about J.F.K.'s promiscuities. Though they are not particularly new or very interesting, they strike me as important -- for publishing if not politics. They seem bound finally to exhaust the public's appetite for Kennediana.
The truth is that journalists who assemble a newspaper, magazine, book or newscast cut the cloth to suit their audience, and they are often only guessing about its size and shape. A paper catering heavily to investors in Mobil and Texaco will give extensive coverage to the White House visit of President Nazarbayev of oil-rich Kazakhstan. But the newscasts that labor to hold the audiences assembled by Sally Jessy Raphael and Jerry Springer will skip the Kazakhs and go heavy on Allen and Kennedy, with all the Mia and Marilyn footage they can find. And they could all point to the news in the "responsible" New York Times to validate their choices.
So I sheathe my pen to read further into the "Statement of Concern." It already bears nearly 500 names, but the signers share no attribute beyond their proclaimed concern. They favor a dozen public forums, financed by the Pew Charitable Trusts, "to clarify the purpose and principles that distinguish our profession." Although another branch of Pew propagandizes for something called "civic journalism," the Concerned Committee promises to avoid "solutions" and "codes of conduct." It will not place owners "at odds with" reporters, or journalism with "business." It seeks only to articulate what journalism "stands for."
Concerned now about the vagueness of this concern, I attend one of the committee's forums: "Can Journalism Be Impartial?" Man from The Times says being fair means applying judgment without passing judgment. Clever. Fellow from local TV says he hires consultants to appraise the quality of his news. Lazy. Washington Post critic says journalists are "salvationists" who want to fix the world by trashing the status quo. Cliche. A liberal Congressman says mistrust of government makes the media conservative, and a conservative columnist says Republicans and Christians feel ill served by a too-liberal media. This is when Navasky mocks the center and I conclude that many readers really favor bias so long as its their own.
Regretfully, I decide not to sign. I cannot find meaning in principles until I know the purposes to which they will be put. How do I know what anyone is for until I know what they're against? My greatest concerns concern something, and somebody.
In considering the state of communication in our culture, I am concerned that the conspiratorial nostrums of Oliver Stone and Seymour Hersh pollute the air we all breathe. I am concerned that the public's perception of "the media" now includes Jerry Springer, Sally Jessy Raphael and other enemies of civilized discourse. I am concerned that the murder, mayhem and medicine that pass for news on local television -- including stations owned by The New York Times Company -- are pushing all journalism into trashy territory. I am concerned that the owners of many media companies are starving their news departments, which should certainly put them "at odds with" conscientious reporters and editors, and vice versa.
Dear Concerned Ones: You cannot define our "responsibilities and aspirations" if you do not point to good and bad media practice, cite cases, name names. Be concerned not with what journalism "stands for" but with the good and evil that it does, day in, day out. Give the Pew money not to high-minded panelists but to abject practitioners ready to confess their failures and frustrations. Hire more critics to publicize our errors, libels and neglects, to do unto us what we do unto others. And pension off my generation of committee creatures, tiresome pleaders for the mythical good old days.

Spain's Freest Spirit Gives Maturity a Try

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN 

DATELINE: MADRID

 BODY:
AT 46, PEDRO ALMODOVAR IS NO longer the overgrown kid he was back in the early 1980's when he sprang from the thick of Madrid's anything-goes night life, armed with a hand-held camera, to record the intoxication of Spain's post-Franco freedoms.
Funny, outrageous, sexy, even kinky, his early movies had plots that veered off at random angles. Culminating with the wackily exuberant "Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown," which won him international acclaim and an Academy Award nomination in 1988, they were a reflection of their author's disheveled, carefree life. 
 "My first films coincided with a moment of absolute, vital explosion in this city," said Mr. Almodovar, whose hair is more neatly shorn than in his wilder days but still stands up on end, giving him the look of a startled teen-ager. "Madrid in the beginning of the 1980's was probably the most joyful, the most fun, most permissive city in the world. It was really the rebirth of the city after such a horrible period as the Franco regime. If there was something characteristic about Madrid, about the culture of Madrid that I belonged to, it was its night life. That was my university, and the university for many others."
Mr. Almodovar, the most visible exponent of "la movida," as the cultural ferment in Madrid after Franco's death in 1975 was known, had arrived in the capital in the 1960's, a teen-ager escaping from the stifling, strictly Roman Catholic environment of the region La Mancha. In the spirit of the times, he tried a bit of everything: he created comic strips, performed in a drag act, sang in a rock band and worked for the telephone company, filming his first experimental movie on weekends.
Sitting recently in a modest office at his production house, El Deseo, surrounded by film posters, books and a few odd, kitschy mementos, Mr. Almodovar was ready to admit that he had grown up, if belatedly. And his 12th film, "Live Flesh," which opened on Friday in New York, is, in fact, a reflection of the adult in him, with a more sober look at love and passion and even a sidelong glance at the yearning for children and family.
Based very loosely on a novel by the British mystery writer Ruth Rendell, "Live Flesh" is the story of five characters -- two women and three men -- whose lives are linked by a shooting in 1990 and the accompanying elements of revenge, desire and jealousy that reach into the next several years. This is a typical mix for Mr. Almodovar, but unlike his more freewheeling films, "Live Flesh" stays on a fairly tight track as its plot unfolds.
In this movie, as in most of Mr. Almodovar's others, Madrid itself is a major protagonist. But this time, the city -- like the director -- has lost its glitzy surface. The Madrid of "Live Flesh" is not the highly colored, highly stylized skyline seen beyond the penthouse in "Women on the Verge"; it's a gritty place of forgotten shantytowns and kindergartens for needy children.
In Europe, critics have hailed "Live Flesh," which opened in the fall under its Spanish title "Carne Tremula," as a welcome departure from the director's old formulas. "The protagonist of the 'movida' has learned how to structure both his stories and his emotions," concluded a review in the Italian newspaper Il Mesaggero.
"I am not sure where he is going," said Angel Fernandez-Santos, a film critic for El Pais, the Spanish newspaper with the largest circulation, in an interview. "but I think Almodovar is entering his period of maturity. He is starting to show complete command of the art form. The earlier films were interesting, but they had little mistakes. In 'Live Flesh,' the whole puzzle fits together."
Mr. Almodovar hates putting labels on his work, but he admits that both "Live Flesh" and his 1995 movie, "The Flower of My Secret," about a romance-fiction writer with a bad marriage who starts writing under her real name, are departures. "In the last two films, I was attracted to narratives that were much more austere and sober," he said, "but that was because that suited those stories best."
He paused briefly, then made an offhand confession. "It also may be," he said with a smile, "that I am saturated by myself, by the things that I have done in the past."
Two of the characters in "Live Flesh" are trapped in a love that is violent and self-destructive, always a subject of fascination for Mr. Almodovar. But the main protagonists are two attractive young people, Victor (Liberto Rabal) and Elena (Francesca Neri), who experience a more innocent, albeit very complicated, romance.
At the start of the film, Victor's birth, on the night in 1970 when the Franco regime declared a state of emergency, is shown, in the back of a bus on a grim, empty Madrid street. By the end of the movie, Elena is about to give birth to their child in the back seat of a taxi as it drives through brightly lighted downtown streets that are buzzing with shoppers. These two nativity scenes serve as bookends, not only for the movie's interlocking love stories but also for the country's historical trajectory over the last quarter-century. And it is here that Mr. Almodovar returns again to reaffirm, and celebrate anew, the meaning of freedom.
"THE TWO PROTAGONISTS in this case have a happy ending because the happiness is the realization that the human being who is about to be born will be born in a better country," he said. "All my movies have a political commentary imbedded in them, and that is the freedom that the characters enjoy."
"I truly think this is the only country where I would have been able to do the things that I have done," he added. "I don't think I could have done them in England, France or the U.S. This is a free country where I can work in complete freedom. And in Spain, we hold on to our freedom like children clutching their most precious teddy bear."
But for Spanish audiences, Mr. Almodovar has dropped an ominous note into the narrative: the voice heard on the radio announcing the state of emergency belongs to Manuel Fraga Iribarne, the president of the Galicia provincial government who was Franco's minister of information and went on to become the grand old man of the conservative party that rules Spain today.
"There is a ghost on the horizon, and that upsets me like it upsets many Spanish people," said Mr. Almodovar. "I think it is impossible for Spain to go back to that awful past, but we are not so far from it either. That voice on the radio is still a live voice; it belongs to an active politician who in fact created the party that is now in power."
Mr. Almodovar's relationship to his native country is fraught with ambiguity. He is treated like a superstar -- the premieres of his films are always top social and cultural events in Madrid -- but his peers have yet to vote him a Goya prize, Spain's top cinematic award.
"THERE IS A KIND OF tradition here," he said, when asked about the absence of "Live Flesh" from this year's list of Goya nominees. "There is a huge hostility against me that is demonstrated every year at this time. I was too successful here and outside Spain. It is a question of envy."
Although he remains committed to the city he calls home, Mr. Almodovar laments Spain's eagerness to join ranks with its northern European partners. He thinks this policy has spawned a deadly homogenization, forcing Madrid to trade in some of its Spanishness -- its late hours and its siesta, for example -- for the sterility of, say, Oslo.
The Madrid in "Live Flesh," he says, could be any city. "I wanted to show a contradiction, both architectural and social, a contradiction which is very alive, very expressive and very unjust, the kind of thing you see in every big city today."
There are also economic pressures peculiar to the 1990's that have changed his beloved city, by putting a premium on competition at the expense of creativity. "Young people now are very preoccupied with the market, which is natural," said Mr. Almodovar, still a hedonist at heart. "But I remember in the early 80's, everything we did we did for pleasure, because we liked to, for the joy of doing it. Now people are not doing that, and it is a pity. Because, when you are starting out, that is when you need to do exactly what you want, with no responsibility."

HEADLINE: Seven Unsung Novels Crying to Be Filmed

BYLINE: By MARGO JEFFERSON 

 BODY:
HAD I THE WINGS OF A dove, I would certainly consider flying away from the decorous sameness of the classics now being made into movies and television specials.
So much Henry James, so very much Jane Austen. And look, all three of the Brontes this time around. Then more Wharton, another "Tom Jones" (six hours this time) and heading our way is a BBC cable channel replete with the old standards. 
 Not that they haven't or won't yield their pleasures. But why this insistence on trafficking only in the sanctioned classics when it comes to pre-20th-century fiction? Filmmakers aren't remotely shy about using any piece of contemporary fiction, however cheap. And film history has taught us that many of the best movies are made from minor and shrewdly trashy work.
Recently, I read a group of thoroughly gripping, not yet canonized American novels that could make first-rate movies. They have strong stories, complicated characters, plenty of room for visual drama, and a mass of social and sexual complications (brutal to subtle) that usually make only the briefest appearance in "great books" movies.
Serious producers and directors say they are desperate for stories with depth and complexity. Screenwriters say their skills are the equal of novelists'. Why aren't they clamoring for the rights to this kind of interesting -- no, more than interesting -- rich, startling literature?
These novels are set in America, in the troubled, violent years between the late-19th century and the onset of World War I. The best-known of the writers is William Dean Howells, usually called the father of American realism. The others, several of whom he championed, are: Harold Frederic, Charles W. Chesnutt, Abraham Cahan, Anzia Yezierska and David Graham Phillips.
Four of them were journalists; Yezierska did menial labor and settlement house work; Chesnutt was a lawyer and court stenographer. And, yes, their jobs took them away from their fiction, but it exposed them to facts of American life that were passing other novelists by.
The interesting thing about what we call minor or second-level fiction can work to a filmmaker's advantage. This fiction doesn't have the unity of structure and language that the masterworks offer. It keeps in all sorts of material that major writers make it their business to refine or get rid of: subplots that keep appearing and disappearing, compulsive asides and expostulations; whole lectures on various topics. And yes, this does mean readers have to live with a surfeit of period attitudes and literary devices. But it also means they get the benefit of a less strictly edited sensibility. These novelists are like archivists, giving us much fuller access to the records, conscious and unconscious, of the age.
This is fiction from an America coming to terms with -- and coming undone by -- the consequences of industrialization, the Civil War and Reconstruction, immigration, the clash of old and new beliefs, be they religious, scientific or political, and, as one of the authors puts it, "the sex relations between men and women." Rebellion, repression; economic need or social habit; love, lust and pure hatred: these are some of the relations that earnest little phrase covers.
As for relations between the races, plenty of people who called themselves pure Nordics considered blacks a sub-species, Jews, Italians and Irish Catholics inferior races and the poor either or both. Each group responded in its own way; each had to make a life in the meantime. The relations among them was a drama you could find playing anywhere, any day of the week, as tragedy, farce or ethnic vaudeville.
Against this backdrop, individual stories and passions fight for our attention. And when it comes to passions -- money, power and what can only be called a sense of one's spiritual worth count as much as sex. Every one of these books takes on the hurly-burly of American life in a way that Wharton and James, for all their mastery, could not have done and did not want to do.
All of these books are in print, and represent just a sampling of the possibilities.
 
Anglo-Saxon Tales as Yet Untold
"A Modern Instance," William Dean Howells, 1882.
As the editor of The Atlantic Monthly, Howells was highly respected and highly respectable. But when he saw the respectable turning vicious and corrupt, he took it on with quiet implacability.
This book's deliberately restrained title conceals a truly horrifying portrait of a socially appropriate, emotionally murderous marriage. Bartley Hubbard is a good-looking New England newspaperman whose self-satisfaction registers as bonhomie in youth and greedy fatuousness in middle age. His wife, Marcia Gaylord, is single-mindedly possessive of him: what is first excused as the romanticism of a young woman about to fulfill her destiny as wife and mother is in fact the deformed obsession of a woman never trained or encouraged to put her mind and heart anywhere else.
Howells follows their move from a small town in Maine to Boston, the big city where they must establish themselves. Bartley thrives -- or thinks he does -- in a claque of breezy, cynical journalists. Marcia never quite gets the mixture of the pragmatic and pious that marks Boston society.
Socially, they keep being shuttled between the middle class and the lower fringes of the upper class. There are plenty of well-done characters -- shrewdly greedy newspaper publishers, repressed, high-minded young men and restless, socially confined young women; heiresses who like taking up charity cases and the lawyers who safeguard their money as they do so. Of course, there is a love triangle -- all torment and self-denial.
But in the end everything comes back to Bartley and Marcia. They are pitiable, they are monstrous, they are totally recognizable: your sympathies and your loathing keep switching from one to the other. Howells's first inspiration for the novel was "Medea." But this being a modern instance of a tragic misalliance, it is divorce that promises a revenge as awful and final as murder.
 
"The Damnation of Theron Ware," Harold Frederic, 1896.
Robert Duvall (who plays a Pentecostal preacher in his current film "The Apostle"), said recently that it is amazing we have so few movies about religion, given how it pervades just about every part of American life. In "Theron Ware," religion dictates people's social, economic and sexual destinies. And having done that, it threatens more souls than it could ever save.
Frederic was a militant realist as a novelist. But in "Theron Ware" his exacting journalist's eye and ear joined forces with the uncanny to create an upstate New York version of the otherworldly terrors and temptations that drive stories from "Faust" to "The Turn of the Screw."
Theron Ware is a young, pleasing and ambitious minister who finds himself assigned to a church in upstate New York. He arrives with his sensible wife and soon discovers he is expected to follow the spiritual and economic dictates of a group of Methodist church fathers who are hard-nosed businessmen six days a week and hard-nosed evangelicals on the seventh.
When he meets his first (that's right, his first) Irish Catholics, he is unsettled but thrilled: they might as well be sorcerers and goddesses leading him into forbidden but exquisite rites and mysteries. A worldly priest; a free-thinking scientist; a wealthy young woman who proclaims herself more pagan than Christian and has talks with the priest that are easier and more intimate than Theron has ever had with his wife. All of this makes him desperate to join their world without having to surrender the rewards of his own. Faith, eros and greed are at war inside him.
And how modern it all is too: the Methodist tent meetings with their tele-evangelist fervor; the Roman Catholic priest suggesting that the church leaven public implacability with private adaptability. And the three women in Theron's life, each needing a certain degree of masculine protection, each trying to see that it doesn't quash their private needs or pleasures. (The most successful of these is Sister Soulsby, a Methodist fund raiser and soul saver whose methods anticipate the best tricks of 20th-century advertising and pop psychology.)
As for Theron, small wonder that with his gift for mesmerizing crowds, his love of admiration and his flexible belief system, he comes to realize that the Senate might suit him better than the pulpit.
 
Racial and Ethnic Dramas in Which the Differences Within a Minority Group Matter at Least as Much as That Group's Relation to the Majority
"The House Behind the Cedars" (1900) and "The Marrow of Tradition" (1901), Charles W. Chesnutt.
Chesnutt's post-Reconstruction South is a treacherous postwar zone filled with brutish and byzantine rituals. (Among the brutish: lynchings. Among the byzantine: a longstanding network of cross-race family and social relations.)
Chesnutt's novels are about tensions, alliances and eruptions of physical or emotional violence on both sides of the color line. Among whites, the clash is usually between old manners and new money; among blacks, it's how a small elite (those with education and professions) and a large group of workers and servants balance class distinctions against racial unity.
And of course there is the third group, the mulattoes, who have the choice of passing for white or designating themselves Negroes or, at their peril, trying to do both. Chesnutt himself looked like a white man and chose to live (in the terminology of his times) as a colored man. With his law background, he found characters and events as much a question of manipulation as of anything we could call truth.
"The House Behind the Cedars" is the tale of a gifted and attractive brother and sister who decide to pass and establish themselves in the best class of whites South Carolina has to offer.
Rena, the sister, makes a brilliant match, which is exactly what her calculating brother has intended. But the engagement is soon threatened, first by her own ambivalence, then by a series of miscalculations, shifting loyalties and full-stop treacheries. The novel itself is a kind of mulatto -- it cannot stay on either side of a tonal or genre line. You could call it an ironic melodrama; you could call it a farcical tragedy.
"The Marrow of Tradition" is a compressed epic and a political thriller. It is set in one town and spans two generations of whites and blacks whose blood and fortunes are entwined. The author surrounds these families with characters who are constantly negotiating their positions on the racial, social and moral scale. (Duplicity can be a game as well as a necessity.) There is a romantic subplot, naturally. And there are moments of grisly comedy that make you feel you are witnessing a minstrel show from hell.
As for the political thriller aspect, its factual base was a race riot that took place in Wilmington, N.C., in 1898. (Chesnutt knew some of the survivors.) In the interests of stripping Negroes of as many rights as possible, a group of white aristocrats joins forces with the newly empowered whites they dismissed as trash before the war, while a few more liberal whites watch, turn away and hope for the best.
There is no one response in the Negro community -- how could there be? Some of the professionals advocate reason and caution; others preach radical defiance. And the working class is split, too, between blacks eager to answer violence with violence and blacks eager to believe that if they just go about their business quietly, it will blow over and leave them unharmed. The novel ends with the riot (it is harrowing), and a quiet aftermath that leaves questions of justice and reconciliation painfully dangling.
 
 "The Rise of David Levinsky," Abraham Cahan, 1917.
As Neal Gabler made clear in "An Empire of Their Own: How the Jews Invented Hollywood," inventing it didn't mean they should put their own life stories on the screen if they wanted to attract a mass audience. But the journalist and novelist Abraham Cahan, with a history much like theirs, could put a similar story into a book.
David Levinsky is a Russian Jew -- part of a vast group of Russian Jews who immigrated to New York in the 1880's. Orphaned and penniless, he settles on the Lower East Side, where every newcomer is sneered at as a greenhorn by anyone who has been in America even a few months longer. But he makes his way up, step by step, mishap by mishap, plan by plan: from street peddler to small manufacturer to millionaire power broker in the ever-expanding business of mass-produced women's clothing.
The business of America is business, said Calvin Coolidge, and that means that business should be (and too rarely is) a great subject for American drama. Not to mention all the social details that accompany a financial rise.
There are the embarrassments: David eating in an expensive restaurant for the first time and not knowing which piece of silverware to use. And the triumphs, as the callow youth who once lusted hopelessly after his landlord's wife and considered marrying a factory girl who earned more than he, becomes a desirable match for the daughters of the best Russian-Jewish families in the city.
And the revenge, for as some of the people who once condescended to him, German Jew and WASP, end up working -- or hoping to work -- for him.
 
Stories of Women Who Are Not Unduly Victimized, Unrealistically Triumphant or Predictably Punished, and Whose Fates We Do Not Know in Advance From Having Already Read the Book or Seen the Movie
"Salome of the Tenements," Anzia Yezierska, 1923.
Yezierska's Jewish immigrant women hurl themselves into the drama of assimilation and self-fulfillment, feeling the pull and the oppressiveness of the world they come from and the one they long for.
Her first book, "Hungry Hearts," was made into a 1920 movie, but New York was where she needed to be to write and she returned from Hollywood a year later. Her best-known novel, "Bread Givers" (1925), has been called "a struggle between a father of the Old World and a daughter of the New."
The wittier, worldlier "Salome" could be called "a struggle between a woman of the New World and a man of the Old," but this time, the Old World man is an old New York WASP and the New World woman is a first-generation American Jew.
Unexpectedly -- it turns out to be a romantic comedy -- Yezierska channels her social conscience into mockery and lets her heroine be the chief mocker. She gives us a sly and very practical happy ending. But a few turns of the plot, and we could have a painful drama on our hands.
"Salome" unfolds on the Lower East Side in the early 1900's. Wealthy philanthropists devoted to the settlement house movement make plans to eradicate poverty and to erase the more unsettling signs of foreignness found among the immigrant poor.
Sonya Vrunsky is poor, smart and beautiful. She hates being patronized and she craves the pleasure that money does buy. When the Yiddish newspaper she works for sends her off to interview a philanthropist, she decides she will marry him. (This is no wild fantasy: Yezierska based her story on such a marriage and on her own relations -- professional, but emotionally tempestuous -- with the philosopher John Dewey.)
Manipulating here, charming there, Sonya wins her millionaire. Together at last, day after day, with the differences that first thrilled them (her vitality, his rectitude) threatening to turn into maddening sociological cliches. Sonya has entered Edith Whartonland: Can she manage to stay there and, if so, can she bear it?
 
"Susan Lenox: Her Fall and Rise," David Graham Phillips, 1917.
Ah, the sensational Susan Lenox, whose life takes two volumes to unfold, and who has thus far been given a wholly inadequate 1931 vehicle that starred Greta Garbo.
When we first meet Susan she is a fresh young thing living with small-thinking relations in a small Indiana town. The only stain on her reputation is the fact that she was born out of wedlock, but it marks her like a scarlet letter once she is accused of being fast with the local rich boy.
Her relatives marry her off to a coarse local farmer; she takes refuge on a showboat with a theater company and never stops moving. She goes from Cincinnati to New York City to Paris. She goes back and forth among tenements, hotels and theaters. She goes from being a street prostitute to a kept woman to an independent woman and from impassive disgust to lust and love.
Phillips was murdered by a man who resented his portrayal of women as blighted by the conventions of society. The world of Susan Lenox is described with a muckraking journalist's lethal precision, from the tenement bed she shares with two other women to how she adjusts her makeup when she is streetwalking. But the story would not work if it weren't such a grand melodrama: Phillips turns melodrama into high-style emotional muckraking.
Classic novels and the films they inspire strive to give us a complete emotional and social world. We are right to love them for that, when so many contemporary films settle for a gripping sequence of events and emotional effects. But constantly drawing on the same books and writers is playing it much too safe.
What are we so afraid of? Is it that we still don't know about whole chunks of our past? Or is it that we still don't want to look?

It also will include an 85,000-square-foot, three-story office building with an 8,000-square-foot day-care center, as well as two free-standing 6,000-square-foot restaurants. 
 The developer is Richard Nicotra, owner/franchiser of 300 fast-food outlets including Everything Yogurt, who purchased 24 acres for $2 million last spring from the city's Economic Development Corporation; he later bought two additional acres from the city. Ten acres of the property will be preserved as wetlands.
The original concept called for a 16-acre campus with three two-story buildings with three restaurants and a free-standing day-care center, said Mr. Nicotra. But the campus has been reduced to devote four acres to vegetation characteristic of a maritime oak forest and containing Nantucket juneberry plants, "the rarest plant ever to grow in New York City," according to Richard Lynch, head of the Sweetbay Magnolia Bioreserve Conservancy, a year-old environmental group.
Construction of the hotel and conference center is scheduled to begin in August. A walking trail, pond and visitors' center with information on plant life are to be part of the wetland area.
Vito Fossella Sr., president of the Staten Island concern Land Planning and Engineering Consultants P.C., designed the project.

New State Code to Ease Rehabilitation-Project Costs

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
EARLIER this month New Jersey put in place a set of rules to govern the rehabilitation of existing buildings. State officials say they could bolster economic development and the production of moderately priced housing, especially in cities.
New Jersey is the first state to design a separate code of standards to encourage renovation projects, which accounted for about half of the $6 billion in construction activity in the state last year. The new code, which became effective Jan. 5, is aimed at establishing a more efficient and cost-effective way for property owners to restore their structures without compromising their safety. There are 2.3 million residences and 500,000 commercial buildings in the state. 
 The regulations were drafted in response to criticism that current renovation requirements, governed under the state's construction code for new buildings, often add unnecessary costs. In many cases, owners were required to upgrade older structures to new construction specifications when the renovation exceeded 50 percent of the overall value of the property, or if there was any change in its use.
The Division of Codes and Standards in the Department of Community Affairs, which oversees housing, developed the new standards over the last two years with input from the Center for Urban Policy Research at Rutgers University in New Brunswick and a 30-member advisory board. The board was made up of local code officials, developers, architects, preservationists and advocates of housing for low- and moderate-income people.
State officials estimate that the new code could reduce the overall cost of a rehabilitation project by 4 to 40 percent, depending on the amount and type of work and the age, size and planned use of the building. Based on a 15 percent saving, the state's annual production of low- and moderate-income housing units could rise by 450 units to 3,450, according to the Affordable Housing Network of Trenton, which lobbied for the rehabilitation code.
The concept also sits well with the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, which is pushing rehabilitation standards as a provision in the national construction codes that states would have the option of accepting. Its standards, published last February, are modeled on earlier draft proposals for New Jersey's new code.
Jane M. Kenny, Commissioner of the Department of Community Affairs, said the new code removed a regulatory barrier to the recycling of older buildings and "adds a kind of predictability to the process." The hope, she said, is that developers will shift their attention from new construction in the suburbs to rehabilitation projects in the state's urban centers, where much of the old building stock stands.
Further supporting such a shift was a bill signed by Gov. Christine Todd Whitman on Jan. 7 that provides incentives to builders to redevelop sites contaminated by industrial pollution. The incentives include tax breaks, equal to three-fourths of the cost of cleaning a site and an exemption from new clean-up costs once a project is approved by the state Department of Environmental Protection.
"These are powerful new tools for urban redevelopment," said Commissioner Kenny.
"Developers shied away from older buildings and cities because it was felt that development was just too difficult," said Arthur J. Maurice, vice president of the New Jersey Business and Industry Association in Trenton. "These two state actions will help change that mindset."
Basically, the new code sets up more flexible standards for rehabilitation based on safety risks, what the building will be used for and the extent of the work. A building being changed from a private residence to a public use -- say a restaurant -- would have to meet more stringent safety requirements than a building where no change of use is intended. In that case, safety improvements would be dictated by the extent of the renovation.
THE new code also permits alternative safety methods, including the installation of a sprinkler system instead of the reconfiguration of a building for an additional exit. It also includes a separate section dealing with historic structures.
The lack of clearly defined costs in fixing older buildings has until now discouraged rehabilitation projects because "if the return on investment is unpredictable the investment usually is not made," said William M. Connolly, director of the Division of Codes and Standards at the Department of Community Affairs.
He said the new code divided rehabilitation work into four categories -- repair, renovation, alteration and reconstruction -- and provided a detailed list of the code requirements needed to accomplish that work, making it easier and less costly in the process.
To illustrate the point, he gave the example of a 41-unit apartment complex on Academy Street in Trenton that was rehabilitated for low- and moderate-income housing under the old code. Under the new standards, he said, the cost of $90,000 per unit under the old standards could have been reduced by about $4,000.
He explained that under the new code old party and exterior walls that are not as fire resistant as most new ones -- but are not a safety hazard -- do not have to be ripped out, resulting in savings of $1,400 per unit. In addition, the old stairwells do not have to be widened from their original 32 inches to the 38-inch minimum needed for new construction, saving another $1,400 a unit. And by putting in a more advanced fire-alarm system instead of the required fire sprinklers costs could be reduced by $1,200 a unit.
No one argues with the goal of the new code. But there are mixed feelings about how effectively it will be implemented.
"After more government grants, the second best way to reduce rehabilitation costs is to adjust the code," said David Dubrow, president of Dubrow Construction Corporation, based in Newark. "But it depends on how much red tape is still involved and how local code officials interpret the new code."
Mr. Dubrow said he would wait to see how the code works and if the promised savings amount to even 20 percent he would probably do more renovations like the one his company is now doing in Orange. That project involves the conversion of an old 40,000-square-foot furniture factory on Scotland Road to 19 high-ceilinged condominiums.
Housing advocates -- including the Affordable Housing Network -- are more optismistic. "The new code is a dramatic improvement," said Diane Sterner, executive director of the network. "Reducing renovation costs allows public subsidies to be stretched farther and, in turn, more projects will get done."
William C. Asdal, who runs a remodeling company bearing his name in Chester that concentrates on rehabilitation projects, added: "Buildings on the fringe of economic viability now become viable and worthy of restoration."
The new code gives homeowners as well as developers "a common-sense way" of looking at older buildings, he said. Mr. Asdal intends to utilize the new standards to build a 600-square-foot addition to his 2,230-square-foot 18th-century stone house in Chester. He estimates that he will save $15,000, or 20 percent, of the overall cost of the project, which will start in March.
In another project under the new code, a former 1920's garage at 30 Greenwood Avenue in the Mill Hill historic district of Trenton that sat vacant for two decades is to be reborn as a private residence. John D. S. Hatch of Clarke Caton Hintz and W. David Henderson of Atlantis Historic Properties, local architects, will restore the 2,000-square-foot, two-story garage and add a third 630-square-foot floor for its owner, Roland Pott, who bought the building last year for $15,500. The cost of the renovation, to begin next month, is $100,000.
By applying the new code, the existing stairwells and corridors, which are narrower than those allowed in new construction, will not have to be widened, nor will the rear and side windows have to be blocked in, Mr. Hatch said. Under the previous regulations, he explained, firewalls would have been required because the windows are close to other properties.
Without the windows "parts of the building would have been unpleasant and unusable and there was a possibility the owner would not have gone ahead with the project," he added.
Now, Mr. Hatch said, the owner will save $10,000 to $20,000 and a boarded-up building will be reused.

A Sports Arena in Hoboken?

 BODY:
What do you think of a proposal to move the Devils from the Meadowlands to an arena that would be built above the Hoboken train station?
 
No Room for More Cars
 My family's been in Hoboken since about 1870 and I also grew up there, leaving in 1982. Two of the biggest reasons for my departure were the lack of parking and the difficulty of getting back into Hoboken whenever I left it, which was daily. To assume that everyone attending all events at the new facility would arrive on public transportation is illogical. Ticket holders will try to drive into town, further clogging already narrow, crowded streets.

Let Them Ride PATH
 The owner, John McMullen, wants a new arena that has luxury boxes. How are "luxury" people going to get there? Can you imagine telling a client, "Here are some Devils-Flyers tickets, use the company suite, and here are some PATH passes to get there"? These people use limos.
New Jersey Transit and PATH will be expected to alter their schedules for game nights. Temporary service adjustments like that will cost money for additional buses and trains, and overtime.

A Future White Elephant
When the shipping and manufacturing industries left, the only thing sparing Hoboken from the fate of its shabbier neighbors was an influx of artists and then young professionals. This has become in some ways a Frankenstein's monster, with an entire economy revolving around entertaining and housing these people. The proposed arena is simply a larger version of the many schemes we've seen in the chase for a highly sought-out clientele, while many other aspects of the town have been neglected. Hoboken's cachet will not last forever. The proposed arena -- built over a historically significant station that should be restored, not obscured -- could become a gigantic white elephant.

Luxury Parking
 With parking being at a premium in Hoboken, it sounds like a parking space might cost more that the luxury suite.

Build Schools Instead
Building all these arenas disturbs me because the nation needs schools. There is never any money to build schools but always money for sporting events. What's wrong with this picture?

HEADLINE: Teaching Adults to Read

BYLINE: By GEORGE JAMES 

DATELINE: UNION

 BODY:
ONE night a week, for several weeks now, 13 people have been meeting in the second-floor activities room of the public library here. The group includes a nurse and a retired nurse, a college student and a financial expert, a receptionist for a pharmaceutical company and a manager for the State Department of Labor, a retired clerk and an unemployed paralegal.
Despite their varied backgrounds and age differences, they have a common bond: they love to read with a passion, and they hope to help others who can't. 
 They are literacy volunteers.
And after finishing this 6-week, 18-hour course, they will be asked to commit at least an hour and a half once a week for the next year to tutor someone in basic literacy or in English as a second language.
"You're a guide, not a dictator," Liela Bernstein told them. A reading specialist and retired high school teacher, Ms. Bernstein is a tutor trainer for the Union County affiliate of the Literacy Volunteers of America. During the first lesson she gave on a rainy January night that might have deterred less dedicated people, she touched on the relationship of mutual trust and respect that develops between tutor and student.
"It's a cooperative effort," she said. "They want relevant lessons to their lives and goals."
Between 40 million and 44 million adult Americans are functionally illiterate, unable to locate an intersection on a street map or fill out a simple form, according to a survey released by the United States Department of Education in 1993. Another 40 million are at a second level, said the report by the Educational Testing Service in Princeton, meaning they have difficulty answering questions about facts in a newspaper article.
In New Jersey, 20 to 23 percent of adults in the state, roughly 1.2 million to 1.4 million people, were at the first level, while 23 to 28 percent performed at the next level of proficiency.
"New Jersey mirrors the national survey," says Margery Oppenheimer, executive director of the New Jersey branch of the Literacy Volunteers. A list of the 26 affiliates, which operate in 20 of New Jersey's 21 counties, appears on this page. (The only county without a program is Warren.)
In the 1996-97 school year, Literacy Volunteers programs in New Jersey provided tutoring in basic literacy skills or in English as a second language to 5,915 people. But with only 4,386 volunteer tutors, the total waiting list of those seeking help stood at 1,410 in late June.
Although it is the largest statewide provider of volunteer-based adult literacy services, the Literacy Volunteers of America is not alone in offering such courses. Programs are also offered by a variety of state agencies and private organizations.
A joint task force of the State Commission on Higher Education and the State Employment and Training Commission has found no fewer than seven state agencies operating 17 programs at a cost of $36 million annually.
In a report scheduled for release in several weeks, the task force also found there were other state programs addressing literacy, but not as a primary focus.
"That means $36 million is a conservative figure," said Martine Hammond-Paludan, executive director of the State Commission on Higher Education and a member of the task force. "The general conclusion of the task force is, if we're going to advance employability and self-sufficiency and improve accountability among the many literacy programs, including improvement of efficiency, there needs to be much better coordination of these efforts."
The State Department of Education has the most programs. It provides money to, or supports with Federal money, 56 adult high schools offering literacy courses and high school degrees to 10,000 students annually; 46 evening schools serving 3,000 foreign-born students; 22 volunteer literacy programs helping 3,000 adults, and 35 adult basic-skills programs providing basic literacy and other services to 35,000 adults. The total price tag: about $21.5 million.
The need for such programs is evident. New Jersey ranks fifth in the nation in foreign-born residents, who make up 13 percent of the state's population, said Ms. Hammond-Paludan. The 1993 illiteracy survey found that 34 percent of the people at level one were foreign born.
In addition, 25 percent of residents 25 and older lack a high school diploma or a Graduate Equivalency Degree and 17,000 students dropped out of public school from 1994 to 1996, she said.
Henry Plotkin, executive director of the State Employment and Training Commission, said people with limited reading and writing skills used to be able to get good jobs in manufacturing but no longer can.
"That's really changed," he said. "It's been a steady evolution for a while to an economy where there is more of a direct correlation between skills and income than at any time in American history."
 
Opening a Book And a Bigger World
High school was difficult for Ada Jimenez, a single mother who lives in Jersey City. When she was 17, she left it to have a baby and found it impossible to return.
Two years ago, she learned about the Jersey City Free Public Library Literacy Program conducted by the Literacy Volunteers.
"I wanted to better myself," says Ms. Jimenez, now 32. "I wanted to be a better reader. I wanted to be able to read to my daughter."
When she started classes, her reading skill was "very low" and she was unable to write a letter. "I was really sad," she says.
"I stuck with it," she recalls. "It wasn't easy. It was very hard. It requires a lot of time. If you're working and a parent, there are a lot of sacrifices you have to make. You have to want it bad."
Aside from improving her literacy skills, Ms. Jimenez went to beauty school during the day and earned a certificate in cosmetology, managed to get her G.E.D. by going to an adult school at night and even obtained a driver's license.
"You know what it is when you can read?" she asks. "It's like the whole world is open to you. You can read maps. You're able to travel."
Now she is taking a computer typing course and working on her resume. She dreams of attending college and even of owning her own business. In the meantime, she wants to increase her reading skills.
"Imagine yourself blind, and one day you're able to see, and you can pick up any book and read it," she says. "It's great. There's so much to learn."
Herman Wilcher, 77, of Plainfield decided about five years ago that he was tired of depending on relatives to help him pay bills by check and do other personal business. So he signed up with the Union County Literacy Volunteers. A native of Savannah, Ga., he moved to New Jersey 33 years ago and briefly ran a sandwich shop in East Orange before taking a job as a porter at A.T.&T.
"I didn't want too many people outside to know I couldn't read and write," Mr. Wilcher says. "It was certainly embarrassing to me."
When he started, he could barely read the alphabet. Now he is reading at about a seventh-grade level. He voted for the first time, does his own banking, can read food labels when he shops and is planning to write a family history.
"I feel so good about it, I can't even explain how I do feel about it," he says. And, he adds: "I can put down things on paper today and look at it tomorrow. I don't have to keep everything in my head."
John Shaw, 37, a custodian at Becton Regional High School in East Rutherford, had a high school diploma but could not read. He would ask co-workers to spell words for him, took an oral exam to pass his boiler test and, when confronted with menus, usually ordered hamburgers.
After studying with the Hackensack affiliate of the Literacy Volunteers for 10 years, he can read signs, menus and newspapers with less difficulty. And he is experiencing the sheer joy of reading books.
"I feel good about myself," he says. "Now when you get yourself hooked on a book, you want to pick up the book every minute you have and read it."
 
Lesson Plans For Real Life
"We got the bus. It was yellow and red. We went to the park. The children played ball. We ate hot dogs. It was a good day."
This story is one that Laurie Glinka gives to people who apply for literacy classes. By asking them questions about it and by using other tests, she can determine how well they read, listen and comprehend.
As program coordinator for the Union County affiliate of Literacy Volunteers of America, she matches students with tutors -- some of 43,400 volunteers nationwide in the Literacy Volunteers, who in 1996 tried to help 67,886 students. The Union County office is one of 400 affiliates in 44 states in the organization founded in Syracuse in 1962.
In doing her assessments of students, she grades them from non-reader to fifth-grade level. Most of Union County's 220 students fall into the mid-second grade to mid-third grade level in reading, she says.
Once students are matched with tutors in confidential sessions that often take place in libraries, the students set their own goals.
Long-term goals, like getting a job, are broken down into short-term goals like learning how to read classified ads or a training manual. Tutors are told they should use students' life experience to teach them, so every lesson plan is different: how to read a prescription bottle, or a note sent home from school.
"The steps give them a sense of accomplishment," says Ms. Glinka, a mother of three who has worked as a manager of a fast-food restaurant, an aide to the elderly, and a bartender.
Karen Paardecamp, who operates a financial and computer consulting company, deCamp Consultants, donated a room in her office in Linden to serve as headquarters for the Union County Literacy Volunteers.
Ms. Paardecamp, who is the literacy group's treasurer and serves on its board, said she became more focused on the literacy issue when she realized it was becoming more difficult to hire qualified employees.
"I myself have a slight dyslexia problem that I've always struggled with," she says.
Although the affiliates are similar, there are variations. The Jersey City Free Public Library Literacy Program, for instance, has a family literacy project in which parents and children meet together to improve reading skills. It also has a computer lab that allows students temporarily without tutors to help teach themselves to read.
"Many people are fearful of computers, and working on them gives them a sense of self-worth and of being in touch with today's technology," says Carol Bloch, the Jersey City executive director.
Each student's skills are reassessed periodically. It may take one person a year to move up one grade level and another only six months. Each progresses at his or her own pace, and much depends on the tutor.
In addressing a class of fledgling tutors, Liela Bernstein said three qualities would make them effective: patience, understanding and creativity. And, she added, "You have to be interested in everything they have to say."
 
Tutor of the Year, And Other Rewards
Some tutors stick with the program for years; others fade away after their year's commitment. To recognize those who have excelled over time, the New Jersey office of the Literacy Volunteers chooses a tutor of the year, honored at a special ceremony each spring.
Now holding the title is Fran Pellmar, a 77-year-old woman from Edison with a background in accounting. She helped run her husband's store in Rahway for 18 years.
Ten years ago, she joined the Middlesex County literacy volunteers and became a tutor in English as a second language.
"I'll tell you, frankly, I've always felt that life has to have meaning, and we only go through this route once," she says. "And I want my life to make some kind of small difference."
But why literacy?
"Because language is very important to me," says Mrs. Pellmar. She was born on the lower East Side of Manhattan, the daughter of immigrants from Poland. "English is my second language," she says. "When I was a child, I spoke only Yiddish.
The reasons for tutoring vary, but all come back to wanting to share the gift of reading and to contribute to society.
"I love to read," says Elaine Gross, a nurse from Summit and a tutor in training in Ms. Bernstein's class. "And the thought of not having that enjoyment is just too sad to imagine."
Bonnie Anderson, a school librarian who is on the board of the Union County affiliate, says people have helped her in her life and she wants to return the favor.
"It took my student three weeks to learn to read a calendar," Ms. Anderson says. "He worked so hard every day at home that when he finally read the calendar for this first time, I cried."
Ms. Bloch worked for years in health care but found her niche as a literacy tutor.
"This is the most important thing I've ever done," Ms. Bloch says, "because I'm helping to change someone's life forever."
In her 10 years of tutoring, Mrs. Pellmar has probably changed the lives of at least 60 students, but she, too, has been changed.
"I've made a lot a friends," she said. "Everyone I've tutored feels close to me, and they feel that through me they're being introduced to American society."
"Working with these immigrants has meant a real lot to me personally because students I tutor, whether in conversation groups or one on one, introduce me to a culture that I was not familiar with, and I'm privileged to be able to learn about them."
Being honored as tutor of the year pleased her, she says, but that wasn't the real reward connected with her work.
What was?
"Just the doing," she says.

HEADLINE: Q[A]
Bonds, School Bonds: He Sells Them

BYLINE: By KAREN DeMASTERS 

 BODY:

WHO -- Rafael Perez, 39, of Teaneck, executive director of the New Jersey Educational Facilities Authority for three years.
 
HIS AGENCY'S JOB -- The authority, little known outside the circle of higher education, was created in 1966 to help public and private colleges and universities sell bonds for capital construction projects, including building classrooms and dormitories. 

WHAT MAY CHANGE -- The Department of Education, the authority and some legislators would like to expand the scope of the authority's activities so it could handle bond sales for construction projects for elementary and high schools. Legislation is expected to be introduced to give the authority this added responsibility.
 
WHY DO THIS? -- Governor Whitman has said more than $2 billion is needed to renovate or replace school buildings and equipment in the 28 poorest districts in the state, which the state Supreme Court, in its Abbott v. Burke decisions, said must be brought up to the same educational standards as the richest districts in the state. The Department of Education estimates that the average age of school buildings in those districts is 56 years. Classrooms are overcrowded, and classes are sometimes held in converted closets or gymnasiums. These schools need new heating systems, as well as computer equipment. To address this, school districts will have to sell bonds to undertake large capital construction projects.
 
WHAT THE AGENCY CAN DO -- "We want to demystify the process of selling bonds," said Mr. Perez, who spent 10 years as a lawyer specializing in public finance. "A school board might sell bonds once every 10 or 20 years. We go to the bond market every month, so we have the expertise needed, and we have more leverage in hiring bond counsels and financial advisers. This frees the school district from going it alone in the bond market. The authority has never defaulted on bonds, so on Wall Street and in the market, we have a reputation and we can sell bonds at a lower interest rate and save schools money."
 
HOW THE AGENCY WORKS -- The authority sells tax-exempt bonds for a school and gives the proceeds to the school for a construction project. The school then repays the authority, which pays the bondholders. The authority does not provide money to guarantee the bonds. The authority, based in Plainsboro, has 11 members and is part of the Treasury Department.
 
WHY INVOLVE THE STATE? -- "Bonds are not always used for the work they are intended for. In the case of the special-needs school districts, the state is paying the debt service on the bonds and taxpayers are providing the money to repay the bond holders. The authority can see that the money is used efficiently and is used for the purpose that was intended."
 
TRACK RECORD -- "In the last three years since I have been here, the authority has sold $1 billion in bonds for colleges and universities. Most of the money has been for new technology, for athletic facilities and for housing," said Mr. Perez, whose salary is $99,000 a year. Since its creation, the authority has been involved in 237 bond sales for the state's colleges and universities. KAREN DeMASTERS

Burning Desires To Enter Hot Business
 Jumping into the cigar craze, two entrepreneurs have founded a cigar production and distribution company, Tsar Cigars, that specializes in oddly sized and shaped cigars. 
 Arthur Metz, chief executive officer, and Danny Lipis, president, began distributing cigars from their office at 450 Park Avenue South, near 30th Street, at the end of November. Their staff of 14 has moved about 600 boxes of cigars so far. They have their own brands, Tsar I and Tsar II, which have several sub-brands. The Petite Perfecto, in the Tsar I line, tapers off on both ends, like a narrow spinning top. The Tsar II line includes short, slender models.
Mr. Metz said he helps compose the blends of Dominican and Sumatran tobaccos. "I grew up in a home where there wasn't a room without a cigar burning," he said. "If you're raised in a butcher's house, you know what the cuts are, and if you're raised in a cigar smoker's house, you know the difference between what's right and what's not."
 
Dissonance Can Be Found Amid Loud Bars on West Side
Upper West Side watering holes can become loud and boisterous, especially on "frat bar row" on Amsterdam Avenue in the 90's. A mellow new lounge on Columbus Avenue called North may be an alternative.
On Christmas Day, Matthew Paratore and Michael Bondanza opened North, at 483 Columbus Avenue between 83d and 84th Streets. Customers can sink into plush cherry colored couches and seats spread over 850 square feet and relax to recorded salsa and blues murmuring through loudspeakers.
"Its a 30's-and-over crowd," said Mr. Paratore, a former tailor. "We bring in straight and gay, black and white, men and women 30 to 70 years old."
Mr. Paratore, who says he started smoking cigars at age 13, is especially proud of the humidor that holds about 150 boxes of cigars for sale and consumption on premises. "But don't worry," he said. "It's not smoky. We have a really efficient ventilation system."
 
Necessity Is the Mother Of Massa's Cafe Harborside
The city told Dominick Massa he would have to turn an old cafeteria for longshoremen on his property into a restaurant as a condition for renewing his long-term lease of 1.2 million square feet in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, so he opened Massa's Cafe Harborside last month.
In a sparsely populated waterfront area, Mr. Massa hosts about 100 manufacturers and distributors (everything from tiles and furniture to soup and nuts) employing about 1,000 people.
Mr. Massa's grandfather and uncle used the cafeteria, at 1 43d Street, between First Avenue and the bay, for lunch when they worked at the old Bush Terminal commodities distribution station. "When I was 5, I remember my mother asked me to bring my grandfather the lunch pail he'd forgotten that morning," said Mr. Massa, who is 52. "The cafeteria was a smoke-filled room with hundreds of people eating around white porcelain tables."
The new restaurant sells Italian food at $10 to $22 an entree under a 50-foot-high vaulted ceiling that glows under spotlights at dinner time. Mr. Massa's son, Michael, is the chef.

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL/Mitsubishi Mirage;
Out of the Shadows, an Eye-Opener

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
MITSUBISHI is known in America for the Montero, its tough, midsized sport utility. The company ubiquitously advertises the Diamante as an alternative to entry-level luxury sedans like the Lexus ES 300. Its Galant has a solid if not broad following in the market for midsize sedans. And while they are beginning to show their age, Mitsubishi's affordable Eclipse and more-macho-than-thou 3000GT sports car still appeal to real road warriors.
All of which leaves the Mitsubishi Mirage, the company's Japanese-made subcompact, to fend for itself. And that's a shame, for both the Mirage coupe and sedan are handsomely finished, exceptionally agile little cars with reasonable price tags. 
 Start with the coupe. Restyled for 1997, it remains a sleek little package that stands out in a field of budget coupes like the Dodge Neon, Chevrolet Cavalier and Ford Escort.
The very basic $11,250 DE model comes with a 1.5-liter, 92-horsepower four-cylinder engine and modest accouterments: cup holders, vanity mirror, radio-cassette player. For $3,500 more, Mitsubishi gets serious: The fancier LS come with a strikingly smooth and peppy 1.8-liter four cylinder that delivers 113 horses. The LS also has air-conditioning; nicer upholstery; a height-adjustable driver's seat; a split, fold-down rear seat; tilt steering wheel, and larger, 14-inch wheels with grippier tires.
Add $744 for power windows, locks and side-view mirrors, cruise control and intermittent wipers. Tack on $793 for a power sunroof and $732 for anti-lock brakes.
Mitsubishi would be happy to include a four-speed automatic transmission, too, for $720. But on this car, the automatic would be a waste. For one thing, the five-speed manual gearbox is a silky delight, right up there in quality with the best from Honda. For another, the LS coupe begs to be driven hard. Indeed, it handles like a kinder, gentler Acura Integra, my own standard for drivability in the less-than-$20,000 class.
The sporty feel of the LS coupe is all the more remarkable in light of the car's high marks for comfort and convenience. The dashboard readouts and controls are models of clarity. And thanks to the height adjustment, the front bucket seats are a cut above the economy-class competition. The tight, tight, tight back seat is best reserved for children -- or, better, folded down for extra cargo space.
The sedan version shares engines with the coupe, but seemingly little else. The coupe shouts, "Drive me," but the more conservative sheet metal and subdued interior of the sedan whisper, "Trust me." Mitsubishi's promotional material makes much of the sedan's passing resemblance to the "chiseled look" of the Diamante. The overall impact, though, is generic Japanese subcompact.
A pretty face isn't everything, however, and the Mirage sedan delivers plenty of what most small-car buyers care about. The cabin has a clean, airy feel; the front seats handle relatively large frames. Back-seat and trunk room are adequate, though not up to the standard of the Mazda Protege. Engine, road and wind noise are nicely suppressed at highway cruising speed.
The price gap between the base DE (smaller engine, fewer amenities) and the LS sedan is just $940, which makes the latter a relative bargain at $13,720. And guessing, surely correctly, that hardly anyone would opt for an LS without air-conditioning, Mitsubishi offers a $1,600 "value package" that also includes power windows, locks and mirrors; cruise control; 14-inch wheels, and a split, folding rear seat.
The LS four-door that I drove came with the four-speed automatic ($680 on the sedan), a model for an economy-car transmission. Under normal throttle, upshifts were almost imperceptible and the transmission betrayed no tendency to hunt for gears on long hills. While Mitsubishi says the automatic adapts the shift points to the style of driving, I never noticed much difference.
The real joy of the Mirage sedan -- what makes it stand out in a field full of no-fuss, no-muss people movers -- is the first-rate handling. A sophisticated four-wheel independent suspension, combined with neutral steering and plenty of road feel, gives you the confidence to toss this sedan around. Indeed, equipped with the stick shift (for better control and acceleration) and the value package, the Mirage LS represents serious value in the pocket-rocket class.
Solid subcompacts can be had for less (think Saturn SL, Hyundai Accent, Ford Escort). A couple thousand dollars more buys extra room or more power (Honda Civic EX, Volkswagen Jetta GL). But the Mirage, coupe or sedan, stands out as a car built for drivers yearning to have fun on a budget.
 
INSIDE TRACK: Subcompacts for the inner child.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: THROGS NECK;
Graduating to the High Seas

BYLINE: By BARBARA STEWART 

 BODY:
Edward Micola and a few of his friends spent a recent Thursday night reminiscing about their past and speculating about their future. All three graduated from college in 1996 and have landed good jobs. One is a social worker at New York University. Another, who majored in sculpture, does graphic design for J. Crew.
But Mr. Micola, 23 and a graduate of the State University of New York's Maritime College at Fort Schuyler, is doing something entirely different. At 4 P.M. on a weekday, while his friends might be fighting drowsiness with cups of coffee at their desks, he could be anywhere in the Atlantic as the third officer on the Chesapeake City, an 880-foot oil tanker. 
 "There's thousands and thousands of miles of ocean and it's all yours," he said. "I'd never seen skies like that. So many stars. In the Persian Gulf, I'd jog in the morning around the deck. There were a lot of dolphins, sea turtles, the occasional whale. I'm breathing in that air being out there and feeling very much alive."
And, with an annual salary of $58,000, he says he is feeling very secure.
On Jan. 8, 31 graduates of the Maritime College in Throgs Neck received diplomas; 125 or so more are scheduled to graduate in May.
Warren Engle of Green Bank, N.J., is looking for a job as a third mate on a tugboat in the region. "Something small to start out with," he said. Greg Banas of Lackawanna, N.Y., said he wanted to sail the Great Lakes and then go into the marine insurance business.
Others join the Navy or the Coast Guard, run casino ships on the Mississippi or become engineers.
Just about everyone who graduates from this SUNY branch who wants a job can get one, said Richard L. Miranda, a college spokesman. "Believe it or not, it's almost a guarantee," he said.
Still, while seafaring jobs are growing worldwide, they are declining in the United States, said Richard T. du Moulin, chairman of Intertanko, a trade group for the tanking industry.
But employees with specialized knowledge are in demand, here and abroad, he said. After the catastrophic Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989, stringent new safety regulations have been adopted. And graduates of the six maritime colleges in the country receive intensive training in the new rules.
Graduates of the Bronx college receive an average starting salary of $35,000, Mr. Miranda said. Those who work at sea usually alternate three or four months on duty with an equal number of months on break at home.
For Mr. Micola, this has added up to long days of labor and adventure. On Jan. 9, he was planning to catch a flight to Kuwait to the ship. "I don't want to sit behind a desk," he said. "I don't want a two-week vacation. I'm young. This is what I want to do now." BARBARA STEWART

HEADLINE: OFF THE RACK;
Can You Crush The Millennium Bug?

BYLINE: By FRED BROCK 

 BODY:
IF the Asian financial crisis and roller-coaster markets haven't given you enough post-holiday worries, you can always turn your attention to the year 2000 computer crisis.
In fact, you should. Less than two years away, a pervasive computer glitch will fully kick in just as the ball drops in Times Square on Jan. 1, 2000. The so-called millennium bug could prove very risky for your personal finances. 
 In its February issue, Money magazine offers an article by Andrea Rock and Tripp Reynolds that examines the issue from the point of view of consumers and investors. It is a scary picture.
As has been amply reported, many computer programs and operating systems use only two digits to recognize years. When 2000 rolls around, the final two digits will be read as the year 1900, in effect starting the 20th century anew. Huge amounts of data and records -- including those for stock and pension accounts -- could be lost or corrupted.
Money points out that problems are already cropping up: Credit cards with an expiration date in 2000 or later have confounded computerized cash register systems in some retail stores, and appointments made for January 2000 shut down a computer network that handles patient schedules at three hospitals and 75 clinics in Pennsylvania.
Money says the problem has become a crisis in part because many companies and governments have procrastinated, counting on a "silver bullet" solution. Now they are realizing that the bug must be fixed chip by chip and line by line of computer code.
According to the magazine, Standish Group International, a consulting firm in Dennis, Mass., has estimated that United States companies will spend $440 billion fixing their cases of the millennium bug.
What's an individual consumer and investor to do? Among other suggestions, Money recommends the following:
* Find out whether your bank has fixed the problem. If you cannot get assurances by the end of this year, shift your money to a national bank, where the Fed is likely to give top priority for bailouts if problems occur.
* Watch your credit cards. If you have one with an expiration date beyond 1999, it may not work or may create problems. Be sure to carry at least one card with an earlier expiration date.
* Make sure your insurance company, especially if it is a small one, has dealt with the problem. Otherwise, you could find a policy canceled by a computer confused about dates.
* Test your computer and the programs you use. All Apple Macintoshes will accept the date change. Most PC's made after 1995 are supposed to, but you won't know for sure until you test.

MUTUAL ATTRACTION Many of February's personal-finance magazines present their mutual fund picks for 1998. Because of differing criteria and categories, the selections have little in common; some are just mind-numbing lists of rankings in which a reader can see how a particular fund has performed.
Smart Money takes a different, and perhaps more useful, approach. It picks six funds that it likes for 1998 and then provides an update on how its 1997 selections performed. No fund appears on both lists, which may give pause to investors who make fund choices for the long term.
The picks for 1998 are: Baron Asset, Fidelity Select Developing Communications, Franklin Global Health Care, MFS Emerging Growth, Nicholas Limited Edition and T. Rowe Price Science and Technology. Gains for the 1997 choices, from Nov. 29, 1996, to Dec. 5, 1997, ranged from 21.06 percent for Janus Worldwide to 39.04 percent for Legg Mason Value Prime -- compared with 32.38 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
Mutual Funds magazine, in its section titled "The Undiscovered Fund," profiles a small fund, Delaware Aggressive Growth, which was taken over last April by Gerald Frey, a former money manager at Morgan Grenfell Capital Management. From January through April last year, the fund lost 22 percent. In the third quarter it soared 36 percent and for the year through Dec. 5 -- the period covered by the magazine -- it gained 47 percent. From Dec. 5 through Friday, though, the fund was down nearly 13 percent. As the numbers indicate, it is a volatile fund that may not be for the faint of heart.
 
INSIDE TRACK February's Individual Investor magazine has three articles that examine the strategy of buying shares in companies in which officers, or insiders, are also loading up on the stock -- under the theory that executives know more than analysts about their companies' prospects.
 
SHORT-CIRCUITED In Worth's February issue, Jim Rogers argues that so-called circuit breakers, which temporarily suspend stock trading when the market falls too fast, mainly benefit Wall Street insiders: They are the only ones with a clue as to what's going on during these timeouts. They are aware, for example, of imbalances of buy and sell orders for a particular stock during the pause. In the case of an imbalance of sell orders, the insiders know how far the stock is likely to fall when trading resumes -- "and therefore the exact point at which they can safely begin to buy," he writes. Meanwhile, he adds, "we're in the dark."
 
BITS AND PIECES Kiplinger's February issue looks at the considerable risk of investing in Russia. . . . In its November issue, Money strongly recommended dumping AT&T stock at $45.25 a share; on Friday, AT&T shares closed at $65.

HEADLINE: SPENDING IT;
Just Refinanced That Mortgage? Maybe It's Time to Do It Again

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

 BODY:
ALL it the re-refinancing boom.
Propelled by a precipitous drop in long-term interest rates to near-record lows in recent weeks, another wave of mortgage refinancings is rolling through the nation, only a few years after the last one crested. This one is characterized by many homeowners seeking cheaper rates for a second time or looking to lock in for a longer term. 
 Mike Dixon, for instance, vice president for finance at the Heartland Institute, an economic research group in Chicago, has refinanced his home twice since September alone. Mr. Dixon bought his home in River Forest, Ill., in 1995 for $250,000. He put 5 percent down and financed the rest at a 8.125 percent rate, fixed for five years, then adjusted annually for 25 years.
He refinanced in September at a 7.625 rate, under the same terms as the first mortgage. Then, earlier this month Mr. Dixon re-refinanced into a 7.25 percent, 30-year fixed-rate loan.
Indeed, it seems in the current environment, many homeowners can save money by refinancing, provided they stay in the home for a reasonable time.
"Refinancing is something that everyone is talking about now," Mr. Dixon said. "And they are not only looking for lower rates, but they are looking to lock in rates instead of having these hybrids."
His decision was easier to make because prepayment penalties -- which penalize some people who refinance -- are not allowed in Illinois. Moreover, brokers in the state pay closing costs, so while interest rates are slightly higher rate, the out-of-pocket costs are less. He said the only inconvenience was having to finance two escrow accounts during the process.
Mr. Dixon was also able to drop his private mortgage insurance because his home had swiftly appreciated; that, along with an additional $5,000 he paid into the loan, gave him more than 20 percent equity, the point at which the insurance is no longer required.
It also brought the new mortgage amount down to $221,750, low enough for Mr. Dixon to get a so-called conforming loan, rather than one at the slightly higher rate for "jumbo" mortgages.
With these moves, Mr. Dixon has seen his monthly payment fall from $2,500 in 1995 to $2,250 in September to $2,150 today -- a drop of $350 in five months.
"People can flip a couple times a year here," he said. "In fact, if rates drop another half-point, I may refinance again into a 15-year mortgage."
Mr. Dixon is not alone in his desire to refinance. Keith T. Gumbinger, a vice president with HSH Associates, a mortgage analyst in Butler, N.J., said that most first-time refinancings in the current swell had been for people who had bought their homes in recent years, or who couldn't refinance earlier because of low equity levels or tight lending standards. Many other borrowers who are refinancing, he said, have probably done so once before in the last decade.
Mr. Gumbinger noted, though, that the recent surge is nowhere near the tsunami in 1992 and 1993, when 30-year fixed-rate mortgages dipped below 7 percent for the first time in more than a quarter-century and some adjustable-rate mortgages had initial rates as low as 3 percent.
Back then, more than 70 percent of all new mortgages were refinancings. As of Thursday, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association of America, a trade group in Washington, 59.9 percent of current mortgage applications were refinancings, up 11.5 percentage points from the previous week and the highest since Oct. 22, 1993.
The current figure is more than double the level a year ago and could rise further if rates stay low or continue to decline. As of Thursday, the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 7.01 percent, according to HSH Associates -- slightly above the 6.83 percent of Oct. 15, 1993, which in turn was the lowest since 1965.
Most of the refinancing activity has been into 30-year fixed-rate loans. Rates on one-year adjustables have not fallen as sharply, and many homeowners who took them out in recent years have found that they are now paying higher rates than they would for a 30-year fixed-rate loan.
As of Thursday, the average adjustable rate, according to HSH Associates, was 5.69 percent, just over one and a half percentage points above its all-time low of 4.15 percent on Oct. 29, 1993. These are teaser rates, though; after the first year, they often rise to the rate of the one-year Treasury security plus two to two-and-a-half percentage points.
In this climate, brokers say, buyers are sharply recasting their expectations of what constitutes a proper mortgage rate. "Eight percent used to be considered a good rate but today the 6 7/8 percent rate is incredible, like manna from heaven," said Ellen Bitton, the president of Park Avenue Mortgage Group, a mortgage broker in Manhattan.
Deciding whether to refinance can be complicated. For starters, many rules of thumb have become outdated.
The old formula was called "2-2-2," meaning refinancing was practical if borrowers had been in a home at least two years, intended to stay at least two more years and refinanced at a rate at least two points lower than their current mortgage rate. But that applied when people were refinancing from one fixed-rate loan into another fixed-rate loan and when refinancing fees were high.
So when is the rate difference wide enough? Neil Bader, chief executive of the Skyscraper Mortgage Company, another mortgage broker in Manhattan, suggests that a drop in rates of even half a percentage point can justify refinancing, if the attendant costs are wrapped into the loan or are paid for by the broker, as Mr. Dixon's was. Such loans are sometimes called "zero-cost" refinancings; in exchange for about three-eighths of a percentage point in the rate, all other fees are paid.
Not considering fees, the savings can be substantial even when rates drop just a little.
"Consider, for instance, a homeowner with an existing mortgage of $200,000," Mr. Bader said. "At a mortgage rate of 7.25 percent, the monthly payment is $1,364. At a refinanced rate of 7 percent, just a quarter-percent lower, the monthly payment would be $1,330, a savings of $34 per month."
Even the calendar is lending support to the refinancing impulse. Banks are more aggressive in their lending at the start of a year, Mr. Bader said, because their internal quotas of how many loans they need to make in the year have not yet been filled, as they often are at year's end.
"This is a compelling time to refinance," he said. "For the first time in over two years, no-points fixed-rate mortgages are available under 7 percent. Prior to this, fixed-rate mortgages under 7 percent were available only if the buyer was willing to pay points."

Chart: "Taking the Plunge"
Refinancing is again a hot topic for homeowners, many of whom took advantage of the last spate of low interest rates earlier in the 1990's to reduce their mortgage costs. The best way to determine whether to refinance is to do the math and compare the costs of a new deal with the potential savings. (Source: HSH Associates)

HEADLINE: Now, Big Blue Is at Your Service

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
IT was the way the new, improved I.B.M. was supposed to work. In September 1996, Louis V. Gerstner Jr., the company's chairman, lured a handful of corporate chief executives to a daylong strategy seminar. During a discussion of research collaboration among companies in different fields, Robert B. Shapiro, the chairman of Monsanto, wondered aloud whether his pharmaceutical and agricultural-products company could use any I.B.M. technology in its genetics research.
Within weeks, a SWAT team of I.B.M. executives was dispatched to Monsanto's headquarters in St. Louis, armed with tantalizing discoveries from I.B.M.'s labs that could be used to help map the gene structure of seeds and human cells. Once in the door, the I.B.M. salesmen looked for other opportunities. Lo and behold, a year later, Monsanto signed a 10-year deal worth hundreds of millions of dollars to I.B.M. 
 But the contract wasn't for computers or for software. And gene research was the smallest part.
Instead, the agreement called for I.B.M. to run Monsanto's mainframe computer system, to install and maintain its 20,000 personal computers, to operate the network that links its facilities and to write new application programs for the company. Having gotten its foot in Monsanto's door, I.B.M. showed its stuff -- and its stuff these days is services.
Competing with everyone from Electronic Data Systems, the computer-services giant, to accounting firms to the teen-agers who set up Web sites for small businesses, I.B.M. has grown in a few short years into the world's largest provider of technology services. It advises clients on technology strategy, helps them prepare for disasters, trains their employees and even gets them onto the Internet.
The services business was started in 1990, three years before Mr. Gerstner was hired. But it played right into his strategic gamble that the way to revive the tottering company was to capitalize on what others saw as I.B.M.'s handicap: its sheer size.
He quickly pulled back from the strategy of his predecessor, John F. Akers, to divide I.B.M. into smaller, more nimble units, perhaps in preparation for spinning them off. Rather, Mr. Gerstner decided, I.B.M. would offer its traditional big customers one-stop shopping for computer products, from microchips to mainframes. And services would be the glue that bound all the hardware together.
While Mr. Gerstner has stabilized the other parts of I.B.M., the unit now called I.B.M. Global Services has been the engine of growth. Its revenue rose from $2.1 billion in 1990 to $19 billion last year, with increases exceeding 25 percent annually. That is now one-fourth of the company's sales, more than from mainframe computers or any other product line. And services now account for half of I.B.M.'s 240,000 employees.
"It's not just the fastest-growing piece of I.B.M.; services have become the soul of I.B.M.," said Laura Conigliaro, an analyst for Goldman, Sachs & Company. "I.B.M. got to where it is today by offering its customers excellent service, solutions and support, but had largely given them away free." Now it charges.
Services may be the soul of I.B.M., but they aren't always a godsend. Profits represent a meager 10 percent of sales, far less than for its other businesses.
In addition, some analysts say I.B.M. lags behind its competitors in some hot areas, notably writing application programs and helping companies farm out business functions like purchasing and payroll.
"I.B.M. has a history of being very good in services that surround its product line," like mainframes, said John M. Whiteside, a former top I.B.M. services executive who is now the chief executive of Servicenet, which runs computer networks for companies. "The question is, can they produce a set of services for the next decade that embraces the hardware and software of all vendors?"
Meantime, with E.D.S. recovering from a two-year slump and new entrants crowding the computer-services field, competition is heating up even as Asia's economic turmoil shrinks its prospects as a market.
AND now, I.B.M. faces a new challenge: the departure of Dennie M. Welsh.
While Mr. Gerstner can take credit for nurturing I.B.M.'s services business, the initiative is largely the creation of Mr. Welsh, the Tennessee-born engineer who ran I.B.M.'s contracts for NASA during the Apollo and space shuttle programs. Mr. Welsh persuaded I.B.M.'s management to tap into its experience in running big computer systems for the Government and go head to head with E.D.S. in the market for operating corporate computer systems. He then nursed the services business through several tough early years with a mix of personal enthusiasm and his ability to navigate the complex corporate structure.
"Dennie Welch was a lone wolf crying out and pursuing the business, and no one was paying too much attention to him," said Stephen T. McClellan, a computer-services analyst at Merrill Lynch. "He has surprised a lot of skeptics in moving I.B.M. beyond the hardware and software business."
Two weeks ago, Mr. Welsh said he would take a leave of absence to fight an immune disorder so rare that the company says it has no name. He was replaced by Samuel J. Palmisano, his deputy in the early years of the services business who went on to run I.B.M.'s personal computer division. Mr. Palmisano, 46, is among the most prominent of a generation of younger I.B.M. executives seen as potential successors to Mr. Gerstner, who just signed a second five-year contract.
Still, Mr. Palmisano will have a difficult time sustaining the momentum. After all, I.B.M., which eliminated nearly 200,000 jobs in the early 1990's, is hiring 18,000 new people into its services division each year.
"Sam's challenge is simply growth," Mr. Welsh said recently of his successor. "We have been growing this thing at 20 percent or more for some time. Statistics don't allow that to continue forever."
In many ways, the dynamics of the services business are the delightful opposite of the treadmill that forces hardware manufacturers to run faster and faster to sell ever more powerful machines at ever lower prices.
Once companies buy these improved machines, they have to program them, maintain them, update them and train employees to use them. For I.B.M., the computers are the razors it sells to reel in captive customers, and the services are the blades that the users must buy again and again. It is the same logic that prompted General Electric to build a business servicing the jet engines it manufactures.
The scope of I.B.M.'s services offerings can be seen by traveling to Boulder, Colo., and prowling the enclosed walkways that connect the low buildings at the company's 493-acre site nestled in snow-covered mountains, one of nine such operations around the world.
The command center is one of those showy rooms, modeled after NASA's Mission Control, in which dozens of hushed technicians scurry about under a glowing wall of giant television screens, pausing occasionally to tap at computer terminals. They are busy performing I.B.M.'s classic, and biggest, technology service, in which it undertakes big, computerized functions like accounting and inventory-management for clients. This outsourcing business took off in the recession of the early 1990's, when companies were searching for ways to cut costs. Some even got an initial financial kick, because I.B.M. and E.D.S. bought their computers and hired their data processors in return for 10-year contracts.
While downsizing and layoffs no longer land an executive on the cover of a business magazine, "strategic partnerships" and sticking to "core competencies" often do. So the Boulder operation does more than save clients money. Monsanto wasn't looking simply for mainframe outsourcing; it wanted a partnership with a single company for research, programming and computer operations. "We are looking for fewer, more substantial relationships," said Patrick J. Fortune, the company's chief information officer.
Other parts of the Boulder center knit such relationships together. Through a tunnel from the command center is the computer room, where the I.B.M. mainframes that handle much of the large-scale data crunching have the appearance of the black obelisk in the movie "2001: A Space Odyssey."
Snaking into the computer room are enough telephone lines to keep a town chatting. I.B.M. has built one of the largest data networks in the world, with links to more than 100 countries. Not only does this network connect I.B.M.'s far-flung data centers to its corporate customers, it has also turned into a major product in its own right. Companies use the network to connect electronically to their suppliers, for example. And, increasingly, I.B.M. helps companies like Merrill Lynch hook their customers to the Internet.
Nearby is a vast facility that offers an eerie "Twilight Zone" sense that something is amiss. There are rooms and rooms filled with desks, telephones and computers, but not a person is to be seen. This is a new, $34 million disaster-recovery center, which will spring to life the next time a hurricane, earthquake or terrorist act disrupts a client's operations.
I.B.M. keeps copies of clients' computer data, so its machines can stand in for theirs. And I.B.M. employees will answer customers' phones until they send their own staffs to Boulder.
Another building houses hundreds of work stations, but unlike the disaster station, it is buzzing with earnest young techies. This is the fastest-growing part of I.B.M.'s service business: the workers operate help lines for stumped computer users at corporations across the country.
Fifteen years after I.B.M. introduced corporate America to PC's, it has become clear that the cost of buying them is only the tip of the financial iceberg of maintaining them and training employees to use them. And beyond the cost is the confusion. These days, many big companies don't even know how many PC's they have or what programs are on them. And that makes it difficult to upgrade the machines' software or track down bugs.
SO, increasingly, corporations are paying companies like I.B.M. as much as $250 a month per user to take these problems off their hands. "We can take control of your PC and tell you that your printer is out of paper," said David Graves, a systems developer. "Then we can tell you where in the closet the spare paper is stored."
Elsewhere at Boulder, and at many other sites around the world, are armies of consultants, programmers, repair technicians and specialists in such fields as updating computers to handle dates in the year 2000 and beyond.
The glitz and scope of the Boulder facility are a far cry from the seat-of-the-pants operation Mr. Welsh and a few other executives cobbled together in 1990. "We got started when I.B.M. was at its worst," Mr. Palmisano recalled, referring to the company's slide into red ink in 1991. "And we needed capital to start up and to hire a lot of people, but we had to earn our way every day."
Then, when the operation opened, nobody was interested. "I was 4 percent of my sales plan in 1993," said Daniel R. Colby, one of the first sales executives Mr. Welsh recruited. "It was real touch-and-go whether we were in the right business."
The company made some whopping mistakes. When a key phone line supporting Amtrak's reservation system was cut, it turned out that I.B.M. had never installed a planned backup. As a result, the railroad's phones were dead for half a day. But in classic I.B.M. fashion, it shipped in so many shock troops so quickly to fix the problem that it was able to repair its relationship with Amtrak.
Other customers were not so understanding. Some, like First Tennessee Bank, abandoned I.B.M. altogether. And several customers that stayed were money-losers, because I.B.M. had won its early contracts with below-market bids.
Lessons were learned, however. As I.B.M. figured out what its real costs were, and as it grew bigger and more efficient, it stopped the kamikaze bidding. As for the unhappy customers, it placated them by writing into their contracts the exact service level they could expect. It promised to fix problems within an hour or a day, depending on how much they were willing to pay. If that is spelled out, I.B.M. says, there's less room for complaining later.
I.B.M. also had to explain to customers that the squads of systems engineers who for years had helped set up new mainframes and keep them humming would now be sending bills for their services. But because this unbundling of services helped I.B.M. lower its computer prices, the complaints were muted.
The company has had to navigate through the potential conflict between providing the best services and promoting its own hardware and software. At a client's request, I.B.M. will buy and operate computers made by Hewlett-Packard or Sun Microsystems and use software from Microsoft or Oracle.
Competitors are quick to note that I.B.M. technicians' advice might not be completely objective, since they are obviously tempted to denigrate rivals' products and pitch their own. And Mr. Welsh made no bones about the fact that whenever he could, he pushed computers made by I.B.M. and software from its Lotus subsidiary. Indeed, I.B.M.'s services unit has turned into one of the company's biggest customers for hardware.
The business began to hum in 1995, when I.B.M. posted $12.7 billion in services revenue, edging past E.D.S. to become the world's largest computer services company two years ahead of Mr. Welsh's master plan.
"They have done a great job in building mass in the service business and a very good job in persuading the market that I.B.M. is a credible player," said Gary J. Fernandes, vice chairman of E.D.S. "We were lured into a false sense of security by the long record of success we had."
Now, Mr. Gerstner is pushing I.B.M.'s services business with a huge marketing campaign built around the Internet. Once companies dip their toes into the on-line waters -- what I.B.M. calls "e-business" -- they will realize they will also need to improve the rest of their systems to keep up, the theory goes. Linking big, complicated systems to one another plays right into I.B.M.'s strengths, the company figures.
"In my old life at the I.B.M. P.C. company," Mr. Palmisano said, "we wanted to put customer support and ordering on line, but we had to get daily information on our parts available from the warehouses of our suppliers. To do that you have to upgrade your entire system."
When other companies go through the same exercise, he said, "a lot of people are just going to say: 'You run all this for me. I just want to take the orders when they come in and be done with it.' "
SMALL businesses are another vast untapped market that Mr. Gerstner has declared a priority. There are millions of them, representing nearly half of the technology spending in the country. And many are hopelessly perplexed by their computers. I.B.M is using the expertise it gained in running its corporate personal-computer help desks to offer scaled-down versions of the same service.
For example, it has just introduced a series of prepaid service cards, which look like telephone cards and are sold in shrink-wrapped packages by computer dealers. One, which costs $200, entitles the holder to call I.B.M. five times for help on any of dozens of software programs.
The company is selling another card -- this one for $25 a computer, with a minimum of five machines -- that is good for one disaster-recovery mission by I.B.M., complete with air-shipped delivery of a new computer and use of a nearby I.B.M. office, if needed.
Similarly, I.B.M. is about to test a mass-marketed training and consulting package aimed at helping small businesses to use the Internet. For fees of $1,000 to $5,000, customers will get the right to a certain number of seminars delivered over the Internet, written material and the ability to get answers to some questions by electronic mail.
Actually, I.B.M.'s small-business product line starts at prices as low as $25 a month for a service that lets companies put their own home page on the World Wide Web.
Why would Big Blue bother with anything that small? For the same reason it was interested in joining Monsanto in genetics research: Once a customer whets its appetite at $25 a month, it is often just a matter of time before it wants a fancier Internet site that can take credit cards. Funny, I.B.M. has just the thing. Just buy a $15,000 I.B.M. server with the $5,000 I.B.M. Net.Commerce software. Need to design your site and get all of this hooked together? Perhaps a $50,000 I.B.M. Smooth Start service package will do.
Well, at least that's the way the new, improved I.B.M. is supposed to work.

SO NBC agreed last week to pay $13 million an episode to hold onto television's most popular show, "E.R.," thereby pumping life into the network for at least another year. The deal-makers were congratulating themselves about all the zeroes before the decimal point. The cast was looking forward to one big payday after another.
But in today's economy, just how much money is $13 million? 
 The seemingly stratospheric payout that Warner Brothers demanded -- and got -- for "E.R." is the same as the value of Visa credit card transactions charged in the 60 minutes that the show is on the air (and in every other hour, around the clock).
But the going rate for "E.R." is still well below the national debt. "It used to be about $13 million a second," said Douglas Durst, the real estate developer who operates the national debt clock on the Avenue of the Americas in Manhattan. "It's now around $6 million a second."
Real emergency room doctors can make $13 million last longer than the "E.R." doctors. The budget for the 34-bed emergency room at Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn for a full year is almost the same as for a single episode of "E.R."
At Maimonedes, $13 million covers only what Dr. Steven J. Davidson, the hospital's chairman of emergency medicine, classifies as direct expenses. Every emergency room has indirect expenses -- "heat and light and having a building and having somebody from respiratory making sure there's oxygen in the hospital's oxygen system, and that there's a supply cart up there and the floors have been washed and waxed."

Good Product. Sound Plans. No Sure Thing.

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
AMERICA'S love of innovation runs deep. More than a century ago, Ralph Waldo Emerson earnestly proclaimed that anyone who invented a better mousetrap would find the world beating a path to his door.
For a dose of reality though, consider the tale of Doumar Products Inc. and un-du, its adhesive neutralizer. 
 There is no question that un-du is the sticker world's version of a better mousetrap. The product can not only remove oil-based labels, stickers, price tags, bumper stickers, masking tape and gum, but it can also make a sealed envelope temporarily transparent so you can confirm whether you really signed that check.
Buyers who managed to find Doumar's low-budget booth amid more than 2,000 others at the International Housewares Show here last week broke into smiles as Mark Foley, the company's marketing director, used un-du to separate Duct Tape from single-ply toilet paper without damaging either. The delight became amazement when Mr. Foley then demonstrated that after allowing a few seconds for the un-du to evaporate, the tape was once again sticky.
"Everyone's awed," said Carlos Sanginesi, owner of Golden Oil International, a wood-polish maker. He had a difficult time competing for attention at his adjacent booth.
Still, after two years of market tests, trade shows, appearances on QVC's home shopping programs and repeated rounds of money raising, Doumar is only now creeping toward commercial success. There have been brushes with financial collapse and fears that larger competitors were about to introduce copycat products, which would have forced Doumar into legal battles it could ill afford.
"We've got a great product, lines of credit from the bank, manufacturing capacity and marketing reps -- and we're struggling," said Gary Reichling, Doumar's chief executive and president. "I don't see how entrepreneurs operating out of a garage without such a great product do it."
How entrepreneurship works -- or flops -- has never been a more crucial economic question. Downsizing has created legions of experienced executives and workers who are looking for employment and opportunity in new ventures. Small businesses are often cited as the major job creators in the economy, but it is new small businesses that account for most of the gains, according to Robert Premus, a former economist for the Joint Economic Committee of Congress who recently set up an entrepreneurial studies program at Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio.
And innovation, while clearly the riskiest form of entrepreneurship, may also be the key to long-term economic growth.
"There are 600,000 to 700,000 new businesses created each year, and an educated guess would be that well under 20 percent have a new product or something distinctive," said Paul Reynolds, a professor at Babson College in Wellesley, Mass., who is coordinator for a consortium of 27 universities, foundations and Government agencies interested in research on entrepreneurs.
"Each invention may only affect daily life a little," he said, "but these things have a cumulative impact that sets the United States apart from other countries."
As Wright State recognized, no self-respecting business school can today ignore the intense interest of business students in such activity. Harvard Business School says that in a recent survey, more than half of its 24,000 graduates classified themselves as entrepreneurs.
And the enthusiasm is not limited to America.
"It's a foregone conclusion worldwide now that if you want your economy to grow, you have to encourage entrepreneurship," said Jerry White, director of the Caruth Institute of Entrepreneurship at Southern Methodist University in Dallas.
One of Professor White's favorite role models for would-be entrepreneurs is his 36-year-old former student, Mr. Reichling, who grew up on a South Dakota dairy farm and studied accounting at his state university. Mr. Reichling and a friend moved to Dallas 10 years ago with $800 between them. They had so little experience with big cities that they did not realize they needed jobs before landlords would rent to them. They slept in their Chevette the first week.
Mr. Reichling soon got work as a $7-an-hour clerk filing waste reports for Dixico, a packaging company that made snack-food bags for companies like Frito-Lay and Keebler. By 1993, he had become a certified public accountant, earned an M.B.A. at Southern Methodist, risen to chief financial officer of Dixico, married and bought a modest home in the suburb of Mesquite.
That year, Bell Packaging, Dixico's Indiana-based parent, decided to sell the company. Mr. Reichling was offered a substantial raise, a better title and the use of a Lincoln Town Car. Instead, he and a partner engineered a risky, $2 million leveraged buyout of a Dixico subsidiary that had piled up $600,000 in losses the previous nine months.
Mr. Reichling invested everything he owned, outside of a small bit of equity in his home. But the gamble paid off when he and his partner quickly restored the company to profitability. They sold it to Huntsman Chemical in 1995 for an undisclosed sum, which, Mr. Reichling says, "left me a millionaire."
Professor White calls the turnaround "an expert piece of entrepreneurship" and uses it as a case study.
But that episode was just a warm-up for the challenge of starting Doumar. The fledgling company was created in November 1995 by two Minnesotans -- Mark Foley, a former salesman of liquor, apparel, chocolate and medical equipment who was looking for a new line of work, and Douglas Farley, a real estate agent. They were dazzled by the response among Minneapolis secretaries and others for whom Mr. Foley had demonstrated un-du after he had been sent samples by its inventor, his father, Charles Foley.
With just $6,000 in capital -- and Mark Foley went into debt, at that, to come up with his share -- Doumar acquired the rights to distribute un-du for two years. But the new company clearly needed more money to grow. That was when Warren Garden, a lawyer who had helped the partners incorporate, introduced them to Mr. Reichling, who had been investing some of his new wealth in a variety of fledgling businesses -- acting, in entrepreneurial argot, as a financial "angel."
ANGELS are the black hole of entrepreneurship research. No one knows how much capital such private investors put up annually, but the consensus is that it is far in excess of the contribution of the $43.5 billion professional venture capital industry. The angels' money, contacts and management advice come at the crucial stage when businesses are too new to get the attention of the venture capital firms, according to Charles Heller, director of the Dingman Center for Entrepreneurship at the University of Maryland.
Mr. Reichling loved un-du but was appalled by the holes in Doumar's business plan. He invested $75,000 in the spring of 1996 on the understanding that Doumar would negotiate permanent distribution rights. He also wanted it to take over manufacturing and control of the patent from Un-du Inc., a venture that Charles Foley had cobbled together with acquaintances in North Carolina in the hope that they would commercialize un-du.
That year was consumed in raising new money, negotiating the Un-du Inc. buyout terms, designing more sophisticated packaging, building a network of sales representatives and courting buyers at shows. There were highs, like winning "best new product" at the Business Product Industry Association show here in June 1996. Mr. Reichling completed the transition from angel to full-time chief executive in September, partly because he felt he owed it to friends and relatives who had invested at his suggestion.
In November, Reading China and Glass, a kitchen and dining room superstore chain based in Newark, Del., placed the first major retail order. Still, the year ended with just $38,000 in revenue and $400,000 in expenses.
"We went through much more money than we thought we would," Mr. Reichling said.
Last year, the tightrope moved much higher. Revenue reached about $800,000, thanks to growing retail orders and a series of appearances on QVC -- including a 10-minute segment last month featuring Mark Foley that resulted in the sale of 30,000 bottles. But the company also invested heavily, moving manufacturing to Texas, expanding production capacity, installing computer and phone systems and hiring more employees.
There were times when the company tottered perilously. In the course of the move, thousands of poorly capped bottles of un-du evaporated. Everyone pitched in to refill them by hand -- and had the blisters to prove it. Local investors and relatives, including Mr. Reichling's parents, both in their 80's, were sometimes recruited as weekend or evening labor to help meet rush orders.
To stay afloat, Doumar's executives twice took pay cuts. Even so, Mr. Reichling had to set up a compensation pecking order. The first to be paid were vendors and hourly workers; then Mr. Foley, who is divorced but has child support payments to make and almost no savings; then Brendan Bauer, the director of operations, whose wife works as a teacher, and finally Mr. Reichling. Pay levels were restored last fall, but December was the first month when everyone was paid on schedule.
Doumar could have made life easier for itself by accepting more money from angels, which was readily available. But Mr. Reichling was reluctant to further dilute the holdings of the early investors like Mr. Foley.
Mr. Reichling is currently the largest shareholder, with more than 30 percent of the company.
Mr. Foley said he was down to 12 percent but, he added, "I know the sacrifices will pay off down the road."
But new bumps always seem to emerge. For instance, when Doumar finally began attracting orders last year from a few nationwide retailers like Walgreens and Staples, it discovered that they routinely demanded 90 days to pay. That squeezes cash reserves at Doumar, which must pay its suppliers up to two months sooner.
Perhaps most discouraging, many retailers who love un-du tell Doumar that they will not place orders until the company has the money to advertise it widely. Others flatly refuse to order from a company with only one product.
THE costs of any wrong move are certain to grow because, as last week's housewares show underscored, potentially tough competitors have started to emerge.
The biggest concern has been the Magic American Corporation, a Cleveland-based maker of specialty cleaners with $30 million in annual revenues and well-established distribution capacity. Six months ago, Magic American served notice that it was paying attention, instigating an investigation by the Consumer Product Safety Commission of Doumar's labeling of the flammable product.
Mr. Reichling said the Federal agency ended up concluding that there was no problem, but the episode was an unexpected, nerve-fraying diversion. Then, buyers told Doumar late last year that Magic American was hinting that it would soon have a cut-price version of un-du under its popular GooGone brand.
At Magic American's booth at the housewares show, Doumar executives encountered the new GooGone "Sticker Lifter" for the first time. They were dismayed that the package resembled un-du's, but the products differ enough that it was difficult to see what Doumar could do about it.
GooGone clearly uses a different, slower-acting solvent that does not preserve the adhesive on the tape or label being removed. Nor does it leave all surfaces stain-free, as un-do does. It comes with a plastic lifting tool, but unlike the one covered by Doumar's patent, Magic American's tool is not attached to the bottle.
"We think the separate tool and the slower action give us more flexibility," said Alan Zeilinger, Magic American's president, who diplomatically praised Doumar for "expanding the category."
The arrival of competitors steps up the pressure on Doumar to quickly take the un-du name national -- and even international -- to help establish it as the clear leader in adhesive removers. If un-du can become a strong brand name, Doumar has a much better chance of adding other products, including stain and odor removers, to its business, even it they are not unique. Only then would it become an attractive supplier for giants like Wal-Mart and Home Depot.
Expanding too rapidly has, of course, led to spectacular debacles, even for famous entrepreneurs. Raising capital without giving away control and most of the profits to investors is one challenge. Attracting the right managers is even tougher, according to those who have studied the field.
But the more frequent, if less visible, error is expanding too slowly, according to Lloyd E. Shefsky, a lawyer who represented entrepreneurs for 25 years. Mr. Shefsky wrote "Entrepreneurs Are Made Not Born" (McGraw-Hill, 1994) and now teaches at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management.
"Survival without huge success is the most common outcome," he said.
The signs are mounting that the issue for un-du is shifting from whether it will survive to how big a success it will be.
"It's been flying off the shelves," said Kimberly Nathan, the buyer for Reading China who gave Doumar its first big break.
But Mr. Reichling remains cautious.
"Every step," he said, "has been tougher than we expected."

HEADLINE: The World: Indonesia's Economic Crisis;
The World Looks at Bali and Sees Krakatoa

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia

 BODY:
WHEN Krakatoa blew apart in 1883 in one of the world's most cataclysmic explosions, it took three months before the first evidence of the eruption off Java was visible in America, in the form of brilliant sunsets created by volcanic ash circling the globe.
When the rupiah, Indonesia's currency, melted down 10 days ago, it took only minutes to feel the reverberations. Currencies and stock markets dropped throughout Asia, and Wall Street took a shellacking. Within hours, President Clinton was on the phone to Asia's longest-serving leader, Suharto, telling him he had only days to get his economic act together. 
 And by the middle of last week, it was hard to move through this steamy capital -- where cement-mixers, loose chickens and tycoons in soon-to-be-repossessed Rolls Royces coexist in a perpetual traffic jam -- without running into delegations of foreign officials in mid-damage control. There was Lawrence H. Summers, the Deputy Treasury Secretary, on a whirlwind tour of seven reeling Asian capitals to build "market confidence." There was Defense Secretary William Cohen, telling the Indonesians "we are here in good times and in bad," and the director general of the International Monetary Fund, Michel Camdessus, dishing out prescriptions for turning bad times into good. (The last plan, his aides acknowledged in a confidential memorandum, may have helped make the bad times worse.)
And that doesn't count the flood of Asian prime ministers, finance ministers, and global economists who came to examine the wreckage, like aircraft engineers looking to prevent the next crash.
But does it really make sense for the world to quiver at the prospect of collapse in a country whose gross domestic product is roughly comparable to the combined annual revenues of Walmart and Exxon -- something in the low $200-billion range? Ten years ago, a meltdown of the Indonesian currency market would barely have warranted two paragraphs on page 17 of the business section. Since then Indonesia has grown and the globe has shrunk. But has it shrunk that much? Probably not.
 
Overreacting?
"There could be an element of overreaction to all this," one senior Western finance official conceded, saying that theories about small markets setting off Krakatoa-sized explosions in faraway lands "might be getting a little overblown."
If Indonesia ignored the world's advice about how to reform its economy, he suggested, it's possible there would be no global contagion. It is just possible that the country might simply find itself cut off from the world economy -- the archipelago version of a black hole that no investor or international banker would get near, except, naturally, for long weekends in Bali.
Still, no one -- especially in Washington -- is eager to let Indonesia sink and see what happens, lest they discover that those annoying globalists are right, and that Jakarta's pain quickly becomes Tokyo's, and Tokyo's becomes New York's.
They are not that adventurous because six months into the Asian crisis people still have a hard time figuring out how an astounding variety of disparate problems -- bad debt in Jakarta, unyielding labor unions in Seoul, uncomprehending politicians in Tokyo, shaky banking systems everywhere -- are mixing together to produce a financial crisis that refuses to end.
In the absence of a real understanding of what is happening, the I.M.F. is prescribing traditional solutions: austerity, high interest rates, opening markets wider. But those do not address the problems of a crushing debt and deepening recession, which may explain why even after the I.M.F. has acted, currencies have continued to drop. There are no magic bullets.
Indonesia is an example of how the Asian crisis has become the ultimate game of three-dimensional checkers, where a false move in a distant corner of the board has a jarring way of affecting all the moves in the middle of the board. And in this case, the middle of the board is occupied by China, Japan and the United States.
But that alone doesn't explain the worry about Indonesia. Sure, its economy is promising, but it's hardly Japan or Korea. There's oil just offshore, sneaker factories and a smattering of medium-tech manufacturing. And it has a lot of problems (which investors were happy enough to overlook when the place was growing at 7 percent a year): It is run by an aging authoritarian who cut deals for his family and friends (many of which the I.M.F. wants broken up); it is a country of legendary corruption, and now there is fear on the streets that when the inevitable political transition begins chaos could ensue. Oh, and its companies borrowed at least $65 billion overseas -- maybe much more -- that they cannot pay back now that the rupiah has plunged 70 percent.
A bad scene, but is it America's problem? By itself, probably not. But Mr. Cohen was here out of fear that if Indonesia destabilizes, so does all Southeast Asia. And Mr. Summers was here because he has learned how quickly a loss of confidence in a nation or a currency can turn an outflow of funds into a panic.
And then there are all the odd linkages among nations that did not exist a decade ago. South Korea, which has problems of its own, has more than 300 companies here, and huge loans to Indonesian enterprises that are now going bust. As those loans go bad, Korea's banks and conglomerates suffer; and when Korea worsens, so does Japan. When less powerful currencies fall, pressure grows in places like Japan and China to let their currencies weaken. Otherwise, for example, Chinese sneakers will not retain their cost advantage over Indonesian sneakers. It is the kind of cycle that seems like it will never end (until one day it switches directions).
 
A Confidence Problem
"I have been impressed by the fact that this is a regional problem as well as a problem in individual countries," Mr. Summers said from South Korea on Friday. "Sound policies in any one country is conducive to confidence that benefits other countries as well."
In fact, while confidence is mildly contagious, the loss of it can be highly contagious. Investors who see a panic in Indonesia have a lot easier time convincing themselves that Malaysia, or Tokyo, is next. So America spent the week holding Mr. Suharto's hand for the same reason Hong Kong is killing its chickens: Because no one will buy if they think there is even a remote chance of catching something deadly.
It may not be rational, but it's a very human response, whether you are on Java, in Hong Kong or in Manhattan.

HEADLINE: The Nation: U.S. v. Microsoft FAQ;
Court Is Not Where They'd Like to Go Today

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
MICROSOFT and the Justice Department were at each others' throats again last week. The venue was a United States District Court in Washington, where a Microsoft programming maven and a Government software expert testified on the fine points of Internet browsers and operating system software.
Hardly the stuff of Court TV, but the case has become an antitrust soap opera. Why? And what is at stake? If the case were an Internet site, the basic questions would be addressed in a FAQ file, shorthand for frequently asked questions (pronounced "fack"). Here then is a FAQ file for, as the suit reads, "United States of America v. Microsoft Corporation." 
 Why is the Government going after Microsoft?
The Justice Department filed a suit last October alleging that Microsoft was violating its 1995 consent decree. In that pact, the company agreed to alter its licensing contracts slightly to avoid Government antitrust charges. But the Justice Department now alleges that Microsoft is breaking that agreement by forcing personal computer makers to load its Internet Explorer browser onto their machines as a condition of licensing the Windows 95 operating system, which is the industry standard. The antitrust decree prohibits Microsoft from tying one of its products to another in its licensing deals with PC makers.
So isn't this a simple case and Microsoft is guilty as charged?
The Justice Department says yes. But Microsoft says no because the same section of the consent decree that prohibits tying one product to another also says that the provision "shall not be construed to prohibit Microsoft from developing integrated products." Microsoft contends that Explorer and Windows are not separate products but a single, integrated product. Explorer, the company says, is a "feature" of Windows.
How important is the consent-decree case?
At first, it appeared to be a wrist-slap suit, but the stakes have risen over the last month. On Dec. 11, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ordered Microsoft to stop forcing PC makers to install Explorer along with its Windows software. It was a temporary setback for Microsoft, and mainly a moral victory for its rival in the browser market, Netscape Communications Corporation. After all, Microsoft gives away Explorer free, so few PC makers, if any, would likely take the unbundled option -- Windows without Explorer.
Microsoft's reply to the judge's order was swift and firm. Saying it could not unbundle Explorer and Windows, Microsoft called the judge's order "senseless." It proposed two unattractive unbundled options -- an outdated version of Windows or a new one that had been ruined by yanking out Explorer.
The Justice Department called Microsoft's response "arrogant" and filed a contempt of court motion. To many in the industry, the company's combative tactics have made it seem a bully. Even its executives admit the company's hard-line stance has tarnished its good name, but they insist their uncompromising approach is based on principle, not pique.
What is the principle?
Microsoft says that only the company should determine what goes into its operating system -- the master control program that serves as the central nervous system of a computer. Any slippage from that principle is a step down the road to what Nathan Myhrvold, Microsoft's chief technology officer, colorfully describes as "the Federal Bureau of Operating Systems."
The bedrock issue in the consent-decree case, says Steven Ballmer, an executive vice president, "is really the fundamental right to innovate."
The Government replies that it has no intention of meddling with software-design decisions; the real issues in the case are less about technology than about the abuse of market power by a dominant company.
Do antitrust laws that date from the 19th-century robber barons really apply to the high-tech industries of today?
The Government believes that they do. "The overarching principles of the use of market power and the abuse of market power are consistent," said Joel I. Klein, Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Justice Department's antitrust division. "The current laws are applicable to new circumstances and new markets like computer software."
Beyond the consent-decree suit, The Government is also weighing an antitrust suit against Microsoft under the Sherman Act of 1890, but it is as yet undecided about bringing the broader case challenging Microsoft's business practices.
But isn't the lesson of the I.B.M. case that the Government and courts move too slowly to keep up with the computer industry?
In 1982, the Reagan Administration announced that it was dropping the Government's antitrust case against I.B.M., which ran for 13 years. The real force that broke I.B.M.'s iron grip on the industry was its own sluggishness in coping with innovations like the microchip and upstarts like Microsoft.
The I.B.M. case has been for the Justice Department what the Vietnam War was for the Pentagon, a humbling experience that has shaped policy ever since. If they bring a Sherman suit against Microsoft, Justice officials insist, it will be sharply focused, in keeping with Mr. Klein's belief that modern antitrust enforcement should limit itself to "surgical intervention."
What should antitrust policy toward Microsoft be?
That's a truly complex issue that probably will be debated for years. Robert E. Hall, a professor of economics at Stanford University, has thought a lot about the subject. A respected mainstream economist who is often mentioned as a candidate for a Nobel prize, Mr. Hall was an adviser to the Justice Department when the consent decree was negotiated and eventually approved in August 1995.
Mr. Hall argues for the benefits of constant scrutiny of Microsoft, given its dominance of a vital industry, but he also argues for careful enforcement. "The big problem in this field is the risk that the cure is worse than the disease," he said.
Practices to prevent, he says, include contracts with outside software developers that stop them from working with Microsoft rivals or licensing deals that exclude competitors. "The challenge is to hold the door open for the next Microsoft," he said, "so there is no way for Microsoft to hold onto its position except to develop great software."

ASIAN TURMOIL, PART I
Try, Try Again
Nothing is simple with Indonesia. The International Monetary Fund thought it had a deal in October to bail out the country and put it on a more austere path. Then came a 1998 budget that imposed austerity on everyone but the Government and the well connected. High-level visitors flocked to Jakarta to explain to the Suharto Government that this just wouldn't do. On Monday, Version 1.1 of the deal had Indonesia pledging to behave and getting a few concessions on budget surpluses and bank closings. (The latter, the I.M.F. acknowledged, had clearly backfired.) But once again the deal was threatened by rear-guard actions to spare the vast business empires of President Suharto's family and friends from the bitter economic pill. Progressively bigger wigs -- including President Clinton and Michel Camdessus, the I.M.F.'s managing director -- weighed in. On Thursday, President Suharto finally agreed to Version 2.0, with its long list of stringent particulars and much less wriggle room. 

ASIAN TURMOIL, PART II
Turning a Corner
Though the two are both experiencing currency crises, South Korea is proving as different from Indonesia as kimchi from cloves. The Seoul stock market staged an impressive revival last week. The benchmark Kospi Composite index has recovered more than half the ground it lost after the global equity selloff last October, and is up 31 percent so far in 1998. Negotiations with foreign banks to refinance the country's debt seemed to be making calm, steady progress, though some smaller American banks have complained of undue pressure from their big money-center competitors, who had been given normally confidential details of the little guys' loans by the Federal Reserve.
 
ASIAN TURMOIL, PART III
Mercantilism Redux
Consensus has it that the only way back to prosperity and a decent credit rating for most of the stricken Asian nations is to throttle back on imports while exporting like mad, preferably to the United States. The Philippines took the concept to heart last week, killing a $600 million Boeing jetliner order on Friday, as did Thailand, which reported for December the biggest trade surplus in its history. Detroit worried very publicly about the new cost advantage for Asian rivals; each of the Big Three told analysts to expect heavy rebates and discounts on cars and mini-vans in 1998 to combat cheaper imports.
 
U.S. v. MICROSOFT
Down and Dirty
Microsoft's battle with the Federal Government is shaping up as an epic mud-wrestling match -- with some of the gooey brown stuff splattering on the referee. In hearings before United States District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, the Justice Department said Microsoft was thumbing its nose at the judge's Dec. 11 order to stop forcing manufacturers to install its Internet browser software in any computer that ships with the Windows 95 operating system. Microsoft retorted that the Hobson's choice it is offering manufacturers -- broken Windows, obsolete Windows or bundled Windows -- was exactly what the judge's order required, so the judge had better be careful what he orders. Contempt, said the Government. Aw, whadda you know anyway? said Microsoft. Judge Jackson said he would rule on the contempt charge next week; a three-judge panel will hear Microsoft's appeal of the Dec. 11 order sometime in March.
 
EARNINGS
Scattering the Chips
Go figure. Motorola, the No. 2 chip maker, reports a strong fourth quarter, with profits up a third from a year earlier even after a biggish one-time write-off, but Wall Street expected even better, so the stock slides. A day later, Intel, the Hertz to Motorola's Avis, chalks up a so-so fourth quarter with profits off a touch, but investors are delighted and push up the whole technology sector. The reason may lie in Asia, where Motorola says it's smarting but Intel isn't overly worried. Apple Computer, Sun Microsystems, Digital Equipment and Unisys all reported positive quarters.
 
DEALS
Cleaning Out the Attic
A company once known as an aggressive acquirer announced plans to shed some pieces that don't quite fit anymore. Viacom inherited the Simon & Schuster book publishing businesses when it took over Paramount Communications in 1994. Now Viacom wants to unload all but the trade book division, even though selling so soon may expose the company to a stiff tax hit on the $4 billion to $4.5 billion in expected proceeds. Another formerly busy buyer, Dun & Bradstreet, subdivided into three pieces last year; now one of the pieces, Cognizant, will itself be divided, into Nielsen Media Research and a health care information business.
 
THE TUBE
Fetching a Fortune
Whether on the gridiron or in the trauma ward, mobs of telegenic young adults rushing heroically about wearing similar clothing is what brings in the big television money. The latest rights auctions for pro football broadcasts ended with Fox retaining the National Conference games on Sunday afternoons, CBS outbidding the incumbent NBC for the American Conference, ABC holding onto "Monday Night Football" and ESPN squeezing out TNT to take the whole Sunday night cable package. The league's total take: $2.2 billion a year, about double the current rate. A day later, stung by its football loss and the imminent demise of "Seinfeld," NBC threw about $13 million an episode at Warner Brothers to keep the hospital drama "E.R.," its top-rated series, for another three years; it had been paying only $2 million per.
 
PRICES
Flat-Lining
As with Generalissimo Franco in the old comedy bit, so too with inflation: The latest bulletins say it is still dead. The Labor Department reported that consumer prices crept up a paltry one-tenth of 1 percent in December and 1.7 percent in all of 1997, a snail's pace not witnessed since 1986. Leave out the volatile food and energy components, and the last time prices were this flat, John Glenn was an astronaut.
(Hmmm . . .) Omens were mixed: According to separate Government reports, the cost of imports fell sharply in December, signaling little chance that inflation will revive next year and adding ectoplasm to the specter of possible deflation, but retail sales made a strong showing in the month, signaling the opposite.
 
MARKETS
Easy Terms
Stock markets have no monopoly on exuberance. Treasury bond yields plumbed some historic lows at midweek before ratcheting up slightly by Friday, especially on the longer maturities, as investors looked for safety and predictable returns in an earnings season made puzzling by the spotty effects of Asian economic turmoil. Analysts say home mortgage rates, which most lenders peg to Treasury yields, are now low enough to spur a new wave of refinancings. Article, page 8.
 
GEEKS WANTED
Short Supply
Never mind medicine, law or pro sports, kids. If you can sling code, you can work anywhere. Demand for computer programmers is far outstripping the supply of new computer science graduates each year, pushing companies to desperate measures to find and keep the talent they need. Recruiters are cold-calling every phone extension at rival software companies, chasing new graduates with distantly related degrees in math or engineering and flying in programmers from overseas to fill the cubicles. Hardest to find are people with a clue about how to fix the year 2000 problem, since it entails conversance with obsolete programming languages and a willingness to fill long days with mind-numbing detail work. The Federal Aviation Administration is among those struggling to tame the problem in time: I.B.M. says the old 3083 mainframes handling some crucial air traffic control tasks won't be safe to use after Dec. 31, 1999.

HEADLINE: Pope and Castro Set a Visit to Befit Gambling Men

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN 

DATELINE: ROME, Jan. 17

 BODY:
Most papal trips -- and Pope John Paul II so far has made 80 outside Italy -- are choreographed, scripted and ultimately predictable. But there are others that for both the Pope and his hosts, are a historical roll of the dice, with consequences no one can foresee.
John Paul's 1979 trip to his native Poland was one such gamble. Another will be next week, when the 77-year-old Pope travels to Cuba to be greeted by Fidel Castro, the 71-year-old Communist revolutionary who has finally decided to risk letting the leader of the Roman Catholic Church into his isolated island nation.
The encounter of those two aging but vital leaders, representing powerful and conflicting world views, is sure to be one of those snapshots that will lurch history forward, no matter what they say to each other when they meet Thursday afternoon in the Palace of the Revolution in Havana.
The Pope's trip, which will be covered by some 3,000 journalists from all over the world, has already brought more attention to Cuba than most other events since the Castro revolution of 1959. That in itself means a lot to Mr. Castro, who is clearly looking to the Pope to rescue him from the pariah status imposed by the United States. During the five-day trip, the Pope, a consistent critic of the use of economic sanctions as a political weapon, is sure to add his voice again to the world's almost unanimous opposition to the American embargo of Cuba.
But beyond the impact of the images, some of which are sure to be stunning, few experts know what to predict.
"My impression after being there is that no one really knows anything," said Msgr. Lorenzo Albacete, a Puerto Rican-born instructor at St. Joseph's Seminary in Yonkers, who just returned from a visit to Cuba. "I talked to a lot of people -- in the church and in the Government -- and everyone is walking around without a clear idea of what they are about to get into."
Even the Pope's health is again an issue of suspense, despite the Vatican's reassuring statements. Pope John Paul, who is believed to suffer from a form of Parkinson's disease, appeared close to collapse on Jan. 11 during a baptism ceremony in the Sistine Chapel.
But few who know the Pope doubt that he at least knows what he wants as he travels to Cuba on Wednesday.
According to Tad Szulc, a journalist and author who has often met with both leaders, the Pope's "basic concept is that something has to be done to allow a peaceful evolution, or a transition in Cuba which will happen sooner or later, whether because of biology or pressure." Mr. Szulc added: "The Pope has enough sense not to go to Cuba for the hell of it. I think he has reason to believe that Castro is ready to enter into a deal."
For Mr. Castro, who has until now been able to stamp out any dissent in Cuba, there is a risk in allowing another leader to share his stage.
"What is going to happen," Monsignor Albacete said, "is a space opening in a society that has never opened before, to an outsider with a comprehensive and strong world view different from the one that has controlled every public space in Cuba for 38 years. It will be like someone coming from Mars."
For the Vatican, there is a risk that the concessions Mr. Castro makes to his visitor and the Catholic Church will be only cosmetic, but still flashy enough to impress world opinion -- like last month's one-time-only Christmas holiday or the recent televised address by Jaime Cardinal Ortega of Havana.
If there are high expectations that the visit will bring lasting change to Mr. Castro's single-party state, they come in large part from the Pope's own track record. His trip to Poland in 1979 was a key episode in a chain of events that, 10 years later, brought about the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe. In other countries with repressive governments, the Pope's visit has prodded the local authorities into making concessions.
As the sole authority for Christianity's largest church, the Pope brings to any visit an institutional weight unrivaled among religious leaders. But there is also the personality and charisma of this Pope, who after 19 years on the throne of St. Peter has become a world-class master of the media and a formidable diplomat.
In meetings with those who might be considered his adversaries, the Pope has typically succeeded in inspiring respect -- even awe -- and establishing trust. Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski of Poland recalled in his book that as the last Communist Prime Minister in 1983, he was moved "beyond all reason" when he met the Pope. "For me, it was a deep personal experience," he said.
In his memoirs, the last Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, described being struck, at his first private audience with John Paul in December 1989, by how similar some of their views were.
"This means we must also have something common 'at the source' in our ideas," Mr. Gorbachev said he told the anti-Communist Pope.
Even Mr. Castro, whose faith in Communism remains unshaken, left his first meeting with the Pope at the Vatican last year sounding more like the Catholic schoolboy he had once been than the atheist revolutionary he became.
"For me, it is a miracle I was able to meet the Pope," he told reporters after his half-hour private conservation in the Vatican in November 1996.
And yet Cuba, one of the last Communist states left in the world, may prove too much even for the Pope's artful lobbying or his public appeal. Cuba is not Poland. Its Catholicism is not so deep, or so interwoven with national identity. Nor is the Pope Cuban, which means he does not bring with him the intense personal and patriotic commitment that is on display during his Polish trips.
And to Cuban exiles like Zoe Valdes, a 35-year-old novelist who lives in Paris, there is the danger that any positive effects of the visit will be whittled away by the Government.
"Internationally," she said, "there will be people who will find things have changed. But within Cuba there will still be repression."
For the Vatican, one goal for the trip is intensely parochial, to gain solid ground for the church in Cuba as it emerges from a long period of marginalization. "The main concern of the church is to obtain some kind of legal existence," Monsignor Albacete said. "Everything else is a hope."
The Cuban people's reaction to the Pope's presence among them is one of the greatest unknowns. Monsignor Albacete said he was struck by people's profound ignorance about the church and the Pope himself.
"Bishops told me that when they walk the streets of Havana, people come up to them and ask them if they are the Pope," he said.
Ms. Valdes said that although many Cubans might be ready to hear the Pope's message, the question would be its meaning to them, given Cuba's dire economic situation.
"This may shake people up -- it might make them think," she said. "But there are a lot of people in Cuba who, given a choice between thinking and finding food for their families, will choose to focus on food."
 
Castro Praises Pope
 HAVANA, Jan. 17 (Reuters) -- President Castro issued a warm welcome for Pope John Paul today, describing him as a man of talent and intelligence and "a historic figure of our epoch."
 In a six-hour speech on state television that began Friday evening and stretched into today, the Cuban leader heaped praise on the Pope, who arrives on Wednesday. He urged Cubans to fill public squares for the four outdoor Masses that the pope will preside over and insisted that the Pope has much in common with the Cuban Government's thinking in terms of condemning the world's social injustices.
 "He's done all his criticisms of Communism," he said. "Now he's criticizing capitalism."

HEADLINE: Sudden Weakness Aside, Suharto Looks to Outlast Economic Crisis

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, Jan. 17

 BODY:
For 32 years, Asia's longest-serving leader, President Suharto of Indonesia, has bent this sprawling, fractious and astoundingly diverse nation to his will.
While he has sometimes been questioned, his control has never been seriously challenged. He has never hesitated to use force, favoritism or political manipulation. But in the last decade, it has been Indonesia's remarkable prosperity -- built partly on a cascade of foreign investment -- that has cemented his control. 
 Suddenly in the last few months this longtime military commander and genius of political survival has encountered a force beyond his control: the world financial markets, which in a stroke have brought his country's currency and its $225 billion economy to the brink of collapse.
"This is something he cannot shoot, he cannot put in jail, he cannot close down like our newspaper," said Jusuf Wanandi, director of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a leading Indonesian policy institute.
On Thursday, under pressure from the markets and leaders around the world, Mr. Suharto appeared to capitulate. He signed a document allowing the International Monetary Fund to direct minute details of his country's daily life, from the price of gasoline to the marketing of plywood and cloves. And he agreed, on paper at least, to break up the cartels that have made his family and loyalists millionaires.
Sensing his sudden weakness, longtime opponents of Mr. Suharto, who is 76, have boldly called for him to step down. Even some of the country's elite have gently suggested that after so many years he should not have to endure the "burden" of guiding the country through a painful economic recovery.
For the United States, the simultaneous emergence of an economic crisis and significant political opposition to Mr. Suharto's continued rule poses a major diplomatic challenge. To quiet the markets -- and keep Indonesia's problems from worsening the rest of Asia's -- Washington is looking for stability. Any suggestion that the world's fourth-most-populous nation, and the biggest military power among Southeast Asian nations, might fall into political chaos would undo Washington's efforts to contain the Asian financial crisis.
At the same time, the United States has been pressing for years for a more open political system in Indonesia, one that would inevitably challenge Mr. Suharto's one-man rule. So all week long here, American officials visiting Jakarta have been performing a delicate pirouette, trying to endorse Mr. Suharto's new commitment to market economics, without seeming to prop up Mr. Suharto himself.
 
Market Economics And State Control
But while Mr. Suharto's future seems suddenly in play, it is far from sure that Indonesia's economic crisis marks the beginning of the end of his long rule. He has placed himself at the center of the I.M.F.'s new restructuring program, and he has been widely expected to seek and receive parliamentary approval two months from now for a seventh term.
"Washington is concerned about supporting Indonesia," a senior United States official said after a week of intensive contacts with Mr. Suharto that included two long telephone calls between the Indonesian leader and President Clinton. "And Suharto just happens to be the leader of Indonesia at the moment."
One of the many mysteries in this chaotic capital is whether Mr. Suharto is truly committed to a radical restructuring of the country's economy, as he says, or whether he is simply uttering the phrases that the markets want to hear.
It is a sign of the new mood here that one of the country's leading newspapers, The Jakarta Post, warned on Friday that the Suharto Government might again defy I.M.F. strictures that loosen its control.
"The risk of a recurrence of corruption, collusion and market distortions is indeed quite big," the newspaper said, "with the children and close relatives of so many top officials, provincial leaders, high military officers and retired generals quite active in business."
The newspaper issued a direct challenge to Mr. Suharto almost unheard of in past years: "The writing is already on the wall: reform now or collapse."
Since Mr. Suharto took over from the nation's founder, Sukarno, in a violent transition that is estimated to have killed half-a-million people, he has managed the economy the way he has managed the country: by presidential decree. Huge projects, from dams to power plants, needed presidential blessing -- and often a partner with close ties to the President. But Mr. Suharto always understood that without foreign trade, relatively liberal investment rules to attract foreigners, and a sharing of the nation's wealth, his command could be imperiled.
Exploiting high oil prices in the 1970's and early 80's, he used the country's huge oil and gas revenue to help pull the nation up from poverty. For the first time, almost all Indonesian children went to elementary school, and by the mid-1980's the country grew enough rice that it no longer had to import it and other staple foods.
 
Crisis and Images Of I.M.F. Domination
But there was still an uneasy blend of market economics, favoritism for Suharto cronies, and state control over key industries. Price supports for key products kept farmers happy, and fuel was subsidized for everyone. Unions have been repressed, but minimum wages have risen regularly to keep the peace -- perhaps too regularly for some economists, undercutting some of the country's competitive advantage.
"The astounding thing," one banker who has lived here for years said this week, "is that he kept the juggling act up for so long. But he understood that rising incomes was part of his political insurance policy."
By the mid-1990's, though, foreign investment began pouring into Indonesia so fast that it was no longer wisely managed. The country's borrowings soared, and banks proliferated -- most of them virtually unregulated. The World Bank, in a generally upbeat study in May 1997, warned that the property market -- especially in Jakarta, where the skyline is filled with half-completed office towers -- was out of control, and that "a reversal could hit Indonesia's still-weak banking sector and be the trigger for an economic downturn."
That is exactly what happened. Thailand's economic collapse led investors around the world to reassess the risks in Indonesia. Soon, the money reversed direction, and the currency crashed. Mr. Suharto turned to the I.M.F. in October for a bailout package worth more than $40 billion, including a $3 billion pledge from the United States. But he did little to enforce its terms, and when he introduced a budget this month that seemed to ignore some of the fund's economic targets, the markets responded with wrath.
With the currency, the rupiah, down 70 percent since last summer, companies with collective overseas debts of at least $65 billion have simply stopped making payments. The new I.M.F. plan does nothing to restructure that debt, which is one reason the currency is still falling.
Today all major economic activity here seems frozen. Exporters cannot borrow the letters of credit they need to get raw materials from abroad. So factories are slowing down. Even the state-owned airline, Garuda, doesn't have the cash to make lease payments on its fleet. A country that counted on 7 percent annual growth now will be lucky if its economy does not shrink. And the social cushion that growth created -- already under strain because of unemployment and a widening income gap -- is eroding as capital leaves the country.
"Everything has collapsed," a 27-year-old advertising worker who identified himself only by his first name, Doli, at a McDonald's in Jakarta. "Up until recently, everyone said that the "fundamentals" of the Indonesian economy were strong," he said, dismissing that thought with a quick epithet.
But Doli's anger was directed primarily at Michel Camdessus, the director general of the I.M.F.
Pointing to a newspaper photo of Mr. Camdessus, arms folded and standing over Mr. Suharto during the signing on Thursday, he said: "That picture says it all. Maybe in the West its O.K. to stand that way, but for us, it's an act of intimidation. That photo tells us that Indonesia is under the thumb of the I.M.F."
Indonesians say it is not "people power" that threatens Mr. Suharto's authority, but "shopping power."
As long as there were more motorbikes in the villages and more cars in the cities, popular discontent was rarely more than an irritant to the President. But the prospect of 20 percent inflation, the end of subsidies, and possible food shortages has set off panic buying and rioting.
Muslim leaders -- Indonesia has more Muslims than any other country -- retired generals and former ministers have joined the calls for a Presidential transition.
 
Scarier Fate: Suharto, Or His Replacement?
The problem is that many people are as worried about a future without Mr. Suharto as they are about a future under his continued rule.
"If Suharto is out, people say, 'Good, we'll have a change,' " said Meri Pengistu, a leading economist. "But we don't know what we're going to get in his place. That's what's so scary."
Mr. Suharto has assured that no potential successor will emerge from his shadow, shuffling vice presidents over the years, and declining to anoint younger politicians.
Whenever the opposition has become too vocal, it has been quashed. Last year, when Megawati Sukarnoputri began to draw large crowds as the leader of one of the two sanctioned non-governmental parties, the Government engineered her ouster from her party, making her ineligible to stand for the Presidency.
A People's Consultative Assembly is to meet in March when Mr. Suharto's sixth five-year term ends. He is expected to choose to stay on, and the assembly is expected to agree. In five previous elections, he has been the sole candidate of all three government-sanctioned parties.
But with Mr. Suharto's health, longevity and political power in question, there is new attention to his choice for vice president -- his potential successor. When the transition finally comes, the next leader will almost certainly be drawn from within the existing power structure, probably from the military, which still dominates Indonesia's politics.
The list of names shifts over time, gauged by the smiles or favors or golfing afternoons shared with the President. Now a new calculus has emerged to chart their popularity: the possible reactions on the fluctuating currency markets.
"If it is Habibi," said a political scientist, naming a businessman and Minister of Technology who is a leading contender in the vice presidential sweepstakes, "the rupiah will fall to 10,000," from its current level of about 8,500 to the dollar. "If it is Hartono," the Information Minister, "it will be 15,000. If it is Harmoko it will be 20,000," he said of the Speaker of the House.
"And if it is Tutut," he concluded, using the nickname of Suharto's powerful eldest daughter, Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana, "all the way down to 30,000."
In the end, there is not likely to be a true successor to Mr. Suharto. Whoever follows him will not come close to dominating every corner of the nation's life as Mr. Suharto has for three decades. The politics of Indonesia makes that highly unlikely; the new dominance of external market forces makes it virtually impossible.

HEADLINE: HUSSEIN DELIVERS A NEW ULTIMATUM ON U.N. INSPECTORS

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Jan. 17

 BODY:
President Saddam Hussein threatened today to expel all United Nations arms inspectors from Iraq in six months if his Government is not cleared of suspicions about its weapons programs and if the sanctions that have devastated the country's economy are not lifted.
His threat came in a speech marking the seventh anniversary of the start of the Persian Gulf war. He spoke two days before the chief United Nations arms inspector, Richard Butler, is to arrive in Baghdad for critical talks on a new standoff over weapons inspections. 
 Iraq has claimed regularly since 1991 that it has accounted for all its weapons of mass destruction, but evidence found by United Nations inspectors has shown otherwise time and again.
The United States and some other nations fear that Iraq may still have biological and chemical weapons. If inspections are not completed in six months, and Mr. Hussein carries through on his threat to end them then, the Clinton Administration will be under tremendous pressure to act, even though military attacks would be unpopular in many capitals, especially in the Middle East.
In his speech, which lasted nearly an hour, Mr. Hussein quoted the Koran and Old Testament prophets recognized by Muslims to portray himself as the fearless defender of Arabs and all poor nations against the "American tyrant." He said the Iraqi people and their leaders were "determined to launch a great jihad" -- a holy war -- to get the sanctions lifted.
But he also made a plea for a new approach to the impasse with the United Nations. He renewed calls for talks to circumvent the United States, which has held out for the strictest Iraqi accountability. He said that since the "American" disarmament plan had failed, other avenues should be tried.
Mr. Hussein couched his threat in an endorsement of a November recommendation by the Iraqi National Assembly that Iraq cease cooperating with the inspections ordered by the Security Council as part of the 1991 cease-fire. The recommendation is now before the Revolutionary Command Council, the highest-ranking Government body in Iraq.
The day began with the wailing of air-raid sirens as a reminder of the start of the Persian Gulf war in 1991. Mr. Hussein said he was aiming his speech, shown on tape on television this morning, to a new generation of Iraqis, "who may still have to shed blood and be martyrs." He seamlessly rewrote the history of Jan. 17, 1991, by leaving out what had caused the war: his army's occupation of Kuwait five months earlier.
"On that day at 2:30 in the morning," he said, "the Americans invaded. Bombs and rockets fell on Baghdad." Iraq won that war, he said -- still calling it "the mother of all battles" -- because "Iraq refused to comply and surrender."
Mr. Hussein hurled epithets at the United States, calling Washington at various points "neo-imperialist," "flesh-mongering" and "leprous." The speech was simultaneously interpreted in English for the benefit of international television networks.
"The United States is full of treachery against all nations and all people," Mr. Hussein said, adding a warning to Latin Americans and Southeast Asians that their financial problems are a manifestation of the American conspiracy to "rule all four corners of the world."
In this very personalized Government, officials seemed to have little or no advance knowledge of the President's remarks. On Friday night, some did not know exactly when the speech would be delivered, and learned the time from network television crews gathered here to await Mr. Butler's arrival Monday.
Mr. Butler is expected to press the Iraqis for access to forbidden sites and to discuss Baghdad's repeated charges that the arms inspection teams have too many Americans.
This week, one group of experts could not carry out its full list of inspections because Iraq objected to the presence of the team leader, Scott Ritter, an American, and to the relatively large number of Americans in the group. The team left on Friday, a day ahead of schedule.
Other teams looking for evidence of biological, chemical and nuclear weapons as well as violations of import-export controls have been able to continue their work.
This round of inspections resumed after a crisis in the fall, when Mr. Hussein expelled American inspectors, and the United Nations withdrew the rest of the teams until Iraq agreed to everyone's return.
After the speech today, Mr. Butler is likely to add to his agenda the issue of a time frame for completing inspections, Iraqi and United Nations officials say. Mr. Butler was in Bahrain today on the way to Baghdad, where he has meetings scheduled for Monday and Tuesday.
American and other officials have for years blamed Iraq for their delays in declaring it free of weapons of mass destruction -- biological, chemical and nuclear, as well as prohibited long-range missile systems. They say Baghdad first lied about its arsenal, then tried to conceal it when investigators began to accumulate evidence.
Lately, the Iraqis have been putting many suspect sites off-limits, even though this has further stalled efforts to complete the investigation.
Iraq began that crisis by invading Kuwait on Aug. 2, 1990, a day after talks failed to resolve the two countries' disputes. These involved their common border, Iraqi debts to Kuwait and Iraqi accusations that Kuwait was pumping more oil than allowed under agreements in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
Four days later, the United Nations Security Council imposed an embargo on commerce with Iraq, but it allowed the Iraqis to continue buying medical supplies and food.
The American-led war that finally pushed Iraq from Kuwait -- with the participation of troops from 30 countries -- did not begin until more than five months later, after high-level diplomatic missions had failed to persuade Mr. Hussein to withdraw.
The war began with an air campaign against Iraq, and the ground offensive that freed Kuwait followed on Feb. 23. President Bush declared victory on Feb. 28, and on March 3 Iraq agreed to a cease-fire on American terms.
A month later, the Security Council formally set the requirements to be met by Iraq. Foremost among them was the agreement to eliminate weapons of mass destruction in exchange for the lifting of the economic sanctions imposed in 1990. Both Baghdad and the United Nations Special Commission created to disarm Iraq expected the process to last only a few months.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
U.S. Envoy's Rebuttal
 WASHINGTON, Jan. 17 (Reuters) -- Bill Richardson, the United States representative at the United Nations, said today that there was no chance of sanctions' being lifted unless Mr. Hussein allowed unfettered access to weapons sites. Mr. Richardson told CBS television that the Iraqi President was "dreaming" if he thought sanctions would be removed before Iraq complied with all Security Council resolutions and allowed "full and unfettered access to all sites of weapons of mass destruction."

Why Cubs Got Beck For a Bargain Price

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
In a world of ever-escalating salaries, Rod Beck may as well apply for welfare. Beck will pitch for the Chicago Cubs next season for $3.5 million, only $250,000 more than his 1997 wages.
Not that Beck needs any sympathy at that rate, but his experience as a free agent was not what top-flight closers have come to expect. It raised more questions than anything else, the primary one being why, with closers moving hither and yon in a game of musical relief pitchers, did Beck settle for a one-year contract with a relatively meager salary? 
 "It ended up being one of those things where teams that could afford a closer didn't really need one and teams that needed a closer couldn't afford one," said Rick Thurman, Beck's agent.
But Beck's status, economically and geographically, might have been different if the Cleveland Indians had done what Thurman said they told him they were going to do.
"We feel like we had been misled by Hart," Thurman said.
He referred to John Hart, the Indians' general manager. Hart was out of town and not available for comment, his secretary said.
"John and I spent all day Christmas, from 6 in the morning until 11 at night, working on a deal," Thurman said. "We finished it, but it was contingent upon them moving Mesa. Hart claimed he knew that he had two deals he could consummate within 24 to 48 hours."
Jose Mesa has been the Indians' closer the past three seasons. Last year, though, he began the season on trial on rape charges -- he was acquitted -- and ended it by squandering a 2-1 lead in the seventh game of the World Series. The Indians, who began talking with Thurman well before Christmas, clearly had thoughts of making a change.
"We had a deal that was a little over $12 million for three years with an option for a fourth year," Thurman said. "The total package with very makable incentives was worth about $20 million over four years."
But, the agent said, no deal for Mesa was forthcoming. Hart had been negotiating with the Cubs and the Colorado Rockies, but nothing definitive developed. More than 72 hours later, the following Monday, Thurman said, he had a message on his voice mail from Dan O'Dowd, Hart's assistant, saying "they were having a hard time moving Mesa."
"We tried to get hold of Hart for quite a while," Thurman said, but the Indians' general manager did not call back immediately. "When he did, about a week later," Thurman said, "he told us the deals he thought he had out there weren't there. The deals just never happened. He wasn't as close as he said."
That episode was the final blow for Beck. One of the most effective closers of the past five years, the 29-year-old right-hander felt the first sting when the Giants acquired Roberto Hernandez, another established closer, from the Chicago White Sox last July 31.
"At that point we needed every able arm we could get," Brian Sabean, the Giants' general manager, said, explaining the deal. But he also said, "Rod had had his ups and downs."
Beck, who earned 37 saves in 45 opportunities, felt burned again after the season when the Giants offered him less than $4 million a year for two years.
"Quite frankly," Sabean said, "it was dismissed out of hand. He wanted more years for a lot of money." Thurman called it "a token offer."
In the last five years, Beck has earned 181 saves. Only Randy Myers (188) and Dennis Eckersley (186) have more. But Beck has raised concerns in some baseball quarters with his increasing size and his decreasing velocity. No longer able to throw the ball past hitters, he relies more on finesse. Managers and general managers are often suspicious of closers whose ability is finesse, not speed.
But the Giants were nevertheless prepared to retain Beck, unless they made him an offer they knew he could refuse.
His weight (listed at 236 but heavier)?
"That was never really a concern for us," Sabean said, "because he was so durable. He never had arm troubles. It never got in the way of his pitching."
His velocity (down to 88 to 89 miles an hour from 94)?
"It's not uncommon for someone who has pitched as much as he has," Sabean said. "He has control and savvy and the ability to get hitters out."
But when the Giants traded for Hernandez, it created doubt in at least some baseball minds and very likely scared off some potential suitors.
The Cubs needed an established closer and got one without overpaying, or even paying the going rate. The Toronto Blue Jays gave Myers $18 million for three years. The Tampa Bay Devil Rays lured Hernandez for $22.5 million over four years. The Giants, who did not want to bid against the Devil Rays for Hernandez, traded for Robb Nen and will pay him $14.5 million over the next three years.
Beck and the Cubs have a mutual option for a second season at a $5.5 million salary, but he can leave after the 1998 season. "By taking a one-year deal with Chicago," Thurman said, "we allowed ourselves the flexibility to be a free agent next year, and if he stays, he'll be paid the market rate."
 
A Partnership Splits
 Tony La Russa and Dennis Eckersley have worked for the same team for the past 10 years and in the same city for the past 13. Now, as the 43-year-old Eckersley pitches himself closer to retirement, they will be separated by teams, cities and leagues. Eckersley has opted to play in his backyard with the Boston Red Sox.
"It was totally his decision," said La Russa, the St. Louis Cardinals manager. "When the season was nearing an end, we made it clear we would be interested in having him back. It's been the same situation the last three, four years with me and Eck. We talk, kind of gauge to see if he's lost his appetite to work out and compete. He let us know he wanted to pitch in '98, but it was obvious that the two years in St. Louis, where his family wasn't with him at all, were very difficult. When the season was over, he said it was very difficult. If there was interest in Boston, it would make sense for him."
Eckersley, No. 2 in career saves behind Lee Smith, has earned 386 of his 389 saves for La Russa, who altered his career in 1987 by converting him into a reliever in Oakland. Eckersley had three saves for Cleveland in his first two seasons in the major leagues when he occasionally relieved.
Is La Russa ready for life without Eck? "That thought has crossed my mind a lot of times," the manager said. "I've had good fortune to have that lead and push the Eckersley button. I've never taken it for granted. It shakes me up some not to have him."
 
Playoff Changes Possible
 The widespread criticism of the playoff format has been heard. The executive council has acted to make two significant changes in the system. Approval by owners and players will enable them to be put into effect next October.
Change one: Instead of predetermining which division champions will play each other and which will play the wild-card team, the three division winners will be ranked by won-lost record. The team with the best record will play the wild-card team unless the two are in the same division. If they are, the team with the best record will play the first-place team with the worst of the three records.
Change two: Instead of a 2-3 split in the first-round schedule, the team with the better record in one pairing and the division champion in the other will play the first two games and the fifth game at home. In the league championship series, the team with the better record will get Games 1, 2 , 6 and 7, unless it's the wild-card entry.
If this format had been in effect last October, the first-round National League pairings would have been the same, Atlanta and Houston, San Francisco and Florida. The Braves would also have had the first two home games, just as they did in their three-game sweep. The other series would have started in San Francisco instead of Florida, meaning the Marlins would have to have won the first two games on the road to duplicate their three-game sweep.
The league series would have been scheduled exactly as it was.
The American League pairings, on the other hand, would have been switched, the Yankees playing Seattle and Baltimore playing Cleveland. The wild-card Yankees would have had to play the first two games in Seattle, which the Orioles did, winning both.

HEADLINE: Tax Credit for Natural-Gas Fuel Could Mean Cleaner Air for South Bronx

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER

 BODY:
More than 10,000 trucks make deliveries every day in the industrial South Bronx, their exhaust fumes contributing to some of the most polluted air in the city. It is a neighborhood where rates of asthma and other respiratory illnesses are the worst in the city, but residents' complaints have long taken a back seat to the area's economic desperation. Any solution that might drive away the trucks, and precious jobs, was no solution at all.
Now, however, legislation enacted in Albany and proposals circulating at city agencies, in the Borough President's office and in Washington, are raising hopes that businesses in the Bronx and throughout the city will soon begin converting hundreds of trucks from diesel and gasoline engines to cleaner-burning compressed natural gas. 
 A little-noticed state law that took effect Jan. 1 provides a powerful economic incentive for companies to convert their fleets to natural gas: a tax credit that would refund 60 percent of the cost of the conversion. The law also addresses the problem of where to refuel the vehicles, since there are only 20 such natural-gas stations in the city and only one in the Bronx. It establishes another tax credit, this one refunding 50 percent of the cost of building a natural-gas fuel station.
Richard Kassel, a senior lawyer at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group, said the new law vaulted New York from a laggard to one of the most progressive states in encouraging the use of alternative fuels.
"It's one of the best, which makes sense because of the air quality problems here and because of the population density," he said. "And the more incentives that are provided, the more successful it's going to be."
Over the last several years, efforts to promote alternative fuels in New York have produced some natural-gas-powered buses, garbage trucks, postal and utility-company trucks, and, most recently, about 150 taxicabs in a heavily subsidized experiment. Yet finding a commercial truck with a "clean" engine was about as hard as finding a place to refuel it in the five boroughs.
Indeed, movement to natural-gas engines is hobbled by a chicken-and-egg dilemma, experts say: Until many such vehicles are on the roads, it will not make business sense to open filling stations for them, and prices will remain high. But without the widespread availability of fuel, at low prices, few vehicle owners will make the switch.
All of which explains why environmentalists were overjoyed in August when the State Legislature enacted the natural-gas tax credits.
Suddenly, change is afoot.
The gas companies are stepping up their marketing efforts, and local businesses that handle conversions from diesel or gasoline to natural gas say they have begun to get calls from potential customers, instead of the other way around.
Robert Meeker, president of Clean Vehicle Systems of Staten Island, said he was already negotiating with a liquor distributor in the city for an order of 10 new trucks and with a beer distributor for another 20. "We're getting a lot of response from small fleets that are looking to do the right thing," he said.
But others say the new law will not be enough. David Vandor, a Tarrytown consultant to fleet owners, said that even with the tax credits, companies could actually lose money because natural gas is no cheaper than gasoline and is slightly more expensive than diesel fuel. He estimated that a company with about 20 trucks would spend $2,952 a year on diesel fuel, but $3,585 for natural gas.
A number of enticements are being considered by government officials, any one or two of which could tip the scales in favor of natural gas, Mr. Vandor said:
*The New York City Department of Transportation is considering creating "green zones" in lower and midtown Manhattan, where curb parking would be restricted to trucks using alternative fuels. An executive at United Parcel Service, which operates 10 natural gas-powered vans in Manhattan, said U.P.S. would be eager to convert more vans if it meant cutting down on the $1 million in parking tickets it now receives annually in Manhattan.
*E-Z Pass discounts, now under consideration for nighttime truck traffic, could be extended to natural-gas-powered vehicles at any hour.
*Registration fees could be reduced for alternative-fuel vehicles.
*Taxes on sales of natural gas could be reduced or eliminated.
In the South Bronx, meanwhile, politicians well schooled in the health dangers of truck exhaust for their constituents -- the asthma rate is 12 times the national average, for example -- are not waiting for new incentives to materialize. Borough President Fernando Ferrer and Congressman Jose E. Serrano are collaborating on a bill that would add Federal tax credits, on top of the new state incentives, for conversions to natural-gas vehicles by businesses in "empowerment zones." The South Bronx empowerment zone, a Federally designated poor urban area that receives special Federal grants and tax credits, includes the Port Morris Industrial Park and the 24-hour Hunts Point Market, as well as more than a dozen waste-transfer and recycling stations.
The bill being drafted by Mr. Ferrer and Mr. Serrano would extend the tax breaks to out-of-town companies whose trucks make regular trips to and from an empowerment zone.
Carlos Padilla, president of the South Bronx Clean Air Coalition, said the idea presented a delicious irony -- a borough turning the other cheek.
"For so long, the rest of the city has put their dumps over here, whenever it benefited them," he said. "Now, when the hotels and restaurants in Manhattan get their food from Hunts Point, it'll be delivered in cleaner vehicles. The Bronx is doing the rest of the city a favor."

HEADLINE: U.S. IS REVIEWING BAN ON THE SALE OF ARMS TO CHINA

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Jan. 17

 BODY:
On the eve of his trip to Asia this week, Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen pressed the Clinton Administration to let an American arms maker sell spare parts to China, despite a ban on sales of military equipment imposed after the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989, Administration officials say.
Mr. Cohen did not advocate a general lifting of the sanctions, the officials said, but rather suggested making an exception in the case of Sikorsky Aircraft of Stratford, Conn., the maker of Black Hawk helicopters. 
 Sikorsky, which sold 24 unarmed Black Hawks to China's military in 1984, has been lobbying the Administration to allow it to sell China replacement engines and other parts, arguing that these should no longer be considered military equipment prohibited by the Tiananmen sanctions.
In internal discussions leading up to Mr. Cohen's three-and-a-half-day visit here, which began this evening, the Administration rejected the idea as premature, and Mr. Cohen agreed to support that decision, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The officials said, though, that the Administration was considering ways to improve relations with China, and that easing the sanctions was among them. That raised the prospect that at least some of the sanctions could be lifted, possibly in time for President Clinton's visit to China later this year, although officials emphasized that no decisions had been reached.
One official said a decision at this time to lift, even slightly, the sanctions on any equipment that would be used by the Chinese Army would provoke too great an outcry on Capitol Hill and elsewhere, and overshadow whatever benefits the United States received in exchange.
"That's a whole lot of heat to take for some spare parts," the official said.
Mr. Cohen declined through his spokesman, Kenneth H. Bacon, to talk about his discussion of the sanctions, saying the Administration's internal deliberations should remain private.
In an interview with reporters during his 12-day tour of Asia, Mr. Cohen said China had to do more to improve human rights, among other things, before the United States could lift any sanctions. But he also made it clear that the sanctions, now nearly a decade old, would not go on indefinitely.
Asked about the possibility of lifting them, he said, "Sometime in the future it may be possible, but I don't foresee it at this particular time."
Nonetheless, Mr. Cohen's willingness to consider an exception to the sanctions underscored the extent to which he is prepared to find ways to improve relations with China in general and its military in particular.
During his visit here, which will include meetings with senior Chinese military leaders and President Jiang Zemin, Mr. Cohen hopes to take steps to increase contacts and build confidence between the American and Chinese militaries.
On Monday, he and China's Minister of Defense, Chi Haotian, are scheduled to sign a document called the Military Maritime Consultation Agreement. The agreement -- essentially a set of rules governing contacts between the countries' navies -- is meant to avoid unintended clashes on the open seas.
Earlier this week, Mr. Chi said exchanges of military officers, among other steps, were already easing tensions, according to the official newspaper China Daily. Those tensions reached a fever pitch when China held provocative military exercises in the Taiwan Strait in March 1996 and the United States responded by sending two aircraft carriers to the region.
There are already signs of improvements. On Friday, an American C-17 cargo plane from Japan flew into Beijing carrying 40 tons of clothing, medicine and other relief supplies for victims of the earthquake that killed 50 people and left thousands without homes in northern Hebei Province, north of Beijing.
Mr. Cohen's visit to China is part of the Administration's efforts to improve relations between the countries. Mr. Cohen is the first Cabinet member to visit Beijing since Mr. Clinton and Mr. Jiang met in Washington in October.
While Administration officials describe a gradual improvement in relations, profound differences remain, and one of the greatest, as far as the Chinese are concerned, is the sanctions.
After the Tiananmen massacre, the Bush Administration imposed an array of sanctions on China, prohibiting investments and trade with its Communist Government, although commercial activity continued. Congress enacted many of the sanctions into law.
The massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators interrupted what had been a small but growing trade in military equipment. Through the 1980's, the United States had, largely in secret, exchanged equipment and intelligence with China as a counterbalance to the Soviet Union.
Sikorsky's sale of 24 of the Army's S-70C Black Hawk helicopters in 1984 was China's first major purchase of American military hardware. Before being delivered to China, the helicopters were stripped of their weaponry, though they were still classified as military equipment because of their advanced motors and avionics, which were made by General Electric.
At the time, the sale totaled $150 million, including spare parts and technical training. Now, nearly 14 years later, the helicopters need repair, and both the Chinese Government and Sikorsky, which is owned by United Technologies Corporation, have been lobbying the Administration to waive the Tiananmen sanctions enough to allow spare parts to go through.
"Spare parts are vital to the operation of any fleet of vehicles," said a spokesman for Sikorsky, William Tuttle. Mr. Tuttle said that with advances in technology since the helicopters were purchased, the replacement engines and other parts needed for the Black Hawks were no longer considered military hardware, even though they are still covered by the sanctions. He declined to discuss the costs of the equipment.
Sikorsky's case had received support in the Pentagon and in Congress, particularly, Mr. Tuttle said, from Connecticut lawmakers like Representative James H. Maloney of the Fifth District and Senator Christopher J. Dodd, both Democrats.
Sikorsky's case also received a hearing from Mr. Cohen. "He was in the 'Gee, isn't there something we can do about this' camp," one Administration official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Under the law, Mr. Clinton could authorize a waiver allowing the sale to go forward without lifting the sanctions generally.
A senior official said the matter remained under review, but added that it was more likely that the Administration would first consider lifting other sanctions, like those on underwriting American companies or enhancing economic development.
The official said Sikorsky's case, like others involving trade with Chinese companies, many of which are state-owned, would almost certainly provoke a firestorm. All the more so since the helicopters are used by China's Army, offically called the People's Liberation Army, although primarily for transport and search-and-rescue missions, the official said.
"It's really a domestic political issue," the senior official said. "How would we answer the critics who say we're arming the P.L.A.?"
A major part of Mr. Cohen's visit will be devoted to finding ways to increase cooperation with China's military, which remains wary of the United States' presence in the region, particularly American support for Taiwan.
"I think we have to take out relationship step by step and not rush it," Mr. Cohen said in an interview today.

HEADLINE: Montana Has Mountains Like Switzerland and Wants Numbered Accounts

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN 

DATELINE: BILLINGS, Mont.

 BODY:
When people think of Montana, what comes to mind are trophy trout, no daytime speed limit and the occasional mountain hermit. That is all well and good, but state officials would like to project something entirely new: the last best place for rich foreigners to hide their money.
In December, Montana completed regulations on a new law that makes it the first state to open its doors as an offshore banking haven, allowing special depositories for wealthy overseas clients seeking privacy and protection for their money. 
 And from Roundup to Big Timber, hard-luck towns are now dreaming of getting a piece of the action that they hope will make Montana the Switzerland of the Rockies or the Grand Cayman of the North.
Skeptics say it is a pie-in-the-Big-Sky idea, one that will attract more laundering of overseas drug and mob money than it will generate in clean currency. But the optimists in the state capital Helena say the new law could eventually earn enough money to replace all state taxes.
Just as states not long ago crossed the once forbidden line of getting revenue from assorted games of chance, what Montana is trying might simply be the next logical step for tax-phobic state legislators.
Some state lawmakers call it the ideal tax, one paid by somebody other than residents and voters. The state would get its revenue from a fee paid by people for the privilege of hiding their money. And though it sounds to critics like a naive reach for easy money, Montana officials say they have not just fallen off the global currency turnip truck. They spent two years studying the issue and are convinced it is a potential revenue gusher.
"There's never been anything like this in North America," said State Senator Mike Sprague, a Republican who sponsored the bill that was passed overwhelmingly by the state's Republican-dominated Legislature and signed into law last fall.
"There is about $3 trillion in money in these kinds of accounts, mostly in Switzerland or the Grand Caymans," Mr. Sprague said. "You figure if we could only get a fraction of that amount, say $75 billion, and from that generate a billion dollars in fees -- that would take care of the entire state share of the budget."
Whether depositors would actually choose to hide their money in Hungry Horse instead of St. Moritz is another question. "People have been calling," Mr. Sprague said, "and not all of them think we're nuts."
The State Commerce Department, which is helping to set up the depositories and would screen and regulate them, said there had been at least 70 inquiries from people wishing to be chartered to accept the overseas accounts. More than 30 potential depositors have also expressed interest, the department said.
"A man called just the other day and asked where he could send his $30 million check," said Vivian Manuel, a spokeswoman for the department. Thus far, there is no place to stash money, gold or stock certificates in the state. But state officials expect to begin chartering institutions or individuals soon.
The rules are fairly simple. Depositors cannot be United States citizens or convicted felons. They must deposit at least $200,000.
In turn, Montana promises a measure of privacy found in no other state -- based on language in the State Constitution -- and the political stability of the United States. International treaties would still apply, of course, so Montana's status as a tax haven would be limited. Still, Montana officials say interest is high because there are so few options for safe sanctuaries.
"We've got the most stable political environment in the world, the most stable currency and, in this state, the strictest privacy and confidentiality laws," said Peter Blouke, director of the State Department of Commerce.
His department's projections for state revenue, about $12 million a year, are much more modest than those expressed by Mr. Sprague. The money would come from a 1.5 percent fee for every depositor. Mr. Blouke shares the view of political leaders here that the state has something to offer that more traditional money hideaways do not.
"We have a very small bureaucracy," he said.
But Federal officials worry about criminal money making its way into the state. And given that the staff in Helena is small and inexperienced in regulating international money, Federal officials say the state will be no match for people who are wise to the ways of hiding tainted money. They also say there is an inherent conflict of interest in having one small state bureaucracy both promote and regulate the depositories.
"The whole thrust of banking in recent years is to know your customer," said Raymond W. Kelly, the Under Secretary of the Treasury for Enforcement. "Well, it's very hard to know your customers in these kinds of offshore arrangements."
The Federal Government, Mr. Kelly said, has little regulatory oversight of Montana's new depositories, beyond the requirement that cash in excess of $10,000 brought into the country must be reported.
Many questions remain unanswered about Montana's venture into offshore banking, Mr. Kelly said, including concerns about people fleeing taxes, liens or fines in other countries. "We're going to be watching this very carefully," he said.
But state officials are not worried. They envision investors from Asia fleeing the uncertainty and financial collapse of recent months and dumping their assets in Montana.
"We would become one option for people who need a portion of their assets to be totally secure and always available," Mr. Blouke said.
With a stagnant population and a somewhat flat economy tied to mining, agriculture and tourism, Montana has struggled in recent years to balance its budget. The state has no sales tax and relies on revenues from income and property taxes.
Some political leaders compare the offshore plan to what Nevada did earlier in this century when it became a mecca for easy divorce and casino gambling.
And if the plan fails in Montana, the state is out only about $18,000, the cost of studying how to set itself up as an offshore banking haven.
"We may be a little naive," Mr. Sprague said. "But for the price of a good used pickup truck, what can we lose?"

HEADLINE: HOCKEY;
With the All-Star Game and the Olympics, the N.H.L. Tries to Extend Its Global Reach

BYLINE: By JOE LAPOINTE 

DATELINE: VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Jan. 17

 BODY:
When the 19-year-old Wayne Gretzky played in his first National Hockey League All-Star game 18 years ago as a member of the Clarence Campbell Conference team, the opposing Prince of Wales Conference had a 51-year-old right wing named Gordie Howe. Gretzky was a young star in his rookie N.H.L. season. Howe was an old star in his final season. But they had one thing in common: Both were Canadian, as were the overwhelming majority of All-Star participants and N.H.L. players in general.
On Sunday, eight days away from his 37th birthday, Gretzky will again grace the midseason showcase when his team representing North America plays a team representing the rest of the world. Among Gretzky's Canadian- and American-born teammates and his European opponents will be more than a few whose early childhood memories include watching Gretzky dominate the sport in the first decade of his brilliant career. They, like many fans, must appreciate that Gretzky is still among the elite of his profession. 
 "Maybe I'm getting younger as I'm getting older," a smiling Gretzky said after a recent multipoint performance.
Still effective in many games, Gretzky has 12 goals and 33 assists for 45 points in 47 games with the Rangers, his fourth N.H.L. team. Every point sets a new record, as his statistics have eclipsed those of Howe and everyone else. To put the Gretzky era into perspective, consider the hockey world of his first All-Star appearance. It was early February of 1980, just weeks before the United States upset the Soviet Union and went on to win the gold medal at the Winter Olympic Games in Lake Placid. Back then, it would have seemed preposterous to predict that N.H.L. professionals would some day play in the Olympics. And it would have seemed ludicrous to suggest that Russian stars would someday be on display in the N.H.L. All-Star Game.
But as the best professionals prepare to represent their nations in the Olympics next month in Japan, eight Russians will suit up on Sunday for the N.H.L. All-Star team that represents Europe. They will skate alongside four players from Sweden, four from Finland, three from the Czech Republic, two from Slovakia, one from Germany and one from Latvia.
The new format was created this season to stoke the flames of rivalry that have cooled since the end of the Cold War and the breakup of the Soviet Union. Gretzky and just about every other player involved said the change is welcome because the high-scoring, low-intensity All-Star games of the recent past have been less than mid-season classics.
"I think this is a good change," Gretzky said. "We needed something to spice up the All-Star game. Those 10-8 scores are not what our game is all about."
It is also part of a larger format, a three-day extravaganza that promotes a growing sport in many ways. On Friday night, the women's teams representing the United States and Canada played before more than 14,000 fans in General Motors Place. Canada won by 2-1 amid waving flags and shaking signs. One of them said: "Trounce the States at Nagano." At the conclusion of the game, many of the Canadian players stood at attention and sang along as the national anthem, 'O, Canada,' was played.
On Saturday night, the N.H.L. players will conduct the skills competition and the old-timers will play an exhibition. In the hallways of the hotels and public buildings, there are booths and exhibits for corporate sponsors. A special honored guest is Willie O'Ree, who became the league's first black player on Jan. 18, 1958. This season, nine black athletes have appeared in N.H.L. games, the most ever.
The host city, with its beautiful mountainous vistas and mild winter climate, has a large Asian population and sits on the Pacific rim. It is an appropriate location as many of these All-Stars look westward toward the east and the competition in Nagano next month. One player likely to gain a following in Japan is Canada's Paul Kariya, a Vancouver native who plays for the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. One of the most talented and charismatic players in the N.H.L., Kariya is of Japanese descent on his father's side.
The N.H.L. of Gretzky's rookie season had only a handful of players born in the United States or Europe. But the league this season is 61.4 per cent Canadian, 16.1 per cent American and 6 per cent Russian. Players from Sweden make up 5 per cent of the rosters and so do those from the Czech Republic.
In that league rosters are 77.5 per cent North American, it is significant that Europeans make up a disproportionate percentage of the top scorers. Of the top 20 players in total points, 9 are from Europe. Sweden's Peter Forsberg, of the Colorado Avalanche, is first in total points with 59. Steve Yzerman, captain of the Stanley Cup champion Detroit Red Wings and a member of Team Canada for the Olympics, said Friday that he noticed this trend recently.
"Does it concern me? No," Yzerman said, repeating a question. "I actually counted that the other day. Europeans dominate it, I think, but there are four or five Canadians and four or five Americans. As the Wayne Gretzky and Mark Messier era is . . . "
He paused, and then rephrased his thought.
"It seems to go in cycles," Yzerman said. "There will be Canadian players coming along. You're always going to have the European players up there now. And the Americans are there to stay as well. And that's something that everybody has to get used to."
The changes of the last two decades have concerned some Canadians. The influx of European talent and the movement of franchises from Canada to the American Sun Belt causes some here to fear that Canadians are losing control of "our game." But from a marketing standpoint, the mix of nations and cultures is ideal for a sport trying to increase its exposure to a world market. Russia's Igor Larionov, who plays for Detroit, recently noted: "The N.H.L. is no longer just a domestic league." Gretzky, asked about the economic upside to the involvement with the Olympics, said:
"For the National Hockey League, as far as merchandising and marketing the sport worldwide, it's a win-win situation."

HEADLINE: Educator Joseph Murphy, 64, Former Chancellor of CUNY

BYLINE: By DAVID ROHDE

 BODY:
Joseph S. Murphy, the son of a labor organizer and a champion of the working class who rose to become Chancellor of the City University of New York, died in an automobile accident near Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, yesterday. He was 64.
It was not clear last night what Mr. Murphy, who had a long history of humanitarian and educational work in the East African country, was doing in Ethiopia. 
 Known for his genial manner and visceral sympathy for the plight of students, Mr. Murphy was able to rebuild and even extend academic programs during his tenure as CUNY Chancellor from 1982 to 1990, despite the system's financial woes.
Mr. Murphy, who learned to speak Yiddish from his mother, a PolishJew, and Gaelic from his father, an Irish longshoreman, was a political scientist and author of two books.
He was known for his ability to combine a practical knowledge of politics with an enduring commitment to the poor and the working class. Highlights of his tenure as Chancellor included the introduction of child care services for working students and the expansion of adult literacy and collaborative programs with the public schools. He also started a summer remedial course that taught basic skills to incoming freshmen, and a $1.5 billion capital construction program to modernize 13 of the university's 20 campuses.
In an effort to make the administration more reflective of student enrollment, he sought out members of minority groups for top positions. In an editorial marking Mr. Murphy's retirement, The New York Times stated that his "legacy of competence and commitment sets a worthy standard for his successor."
Born in Newark, New Jersey, in 1933, Mr. Murphy attended the University of Colorado and received his bachelor's degree from Olivet College in Michigan in 1955. A recipient of a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship and others, Mr. Murphy received his doctorate from Brandeis University in 1961 and was an assistant professor at Brandeis until 1965.
Mr. Murphy served as director of the Peace Corps' Virgin Island Training Center in St. Croix from 1965 to 1966; as assistant Office Secretary in the Department of Health Education and Welfare in Washington from from 1966 to 1967; as an Associate Director of the Job Corps in the Office of Economic Opportunity in Washington from 1967 to 1968, and as director of Peace Corps operations in Ethiopia from 1968 to 1970.
He then returned to the United State and held a series of academic posts that eventually led him to head CUNY, the nation's third largest public university.
Mr. Murphy served as the Vice Chancellor for Higher Education for the state of New Jersey from 1970 to 1971. He was president of Queens College from 1971 to 1977 and president of Bennington University in Vermont from 1977 to 1982 until he was named Chancellor of CUNY.
Mr. Murphy had continued teaching at CUNY since his retirement as Chancellor and had served at a number of posts in Africa. He worked as an election observer in Ethiopia in 1992 and as a consultant for the Constitutional Commission in Addis Ababa in 1993. Mr. Murphy had also served as a member of the board of YIVO Institute for Jewish Research since 1993 and the UNESCO Global Project since 1992.
Mr. Murphy is survived by his wife Susan Crile, and his children from a previous marriage Lisa, Susanne, and Peter.

HEADLINE: THE BOATING REPORT;
Preparing to Race in Key West, and Beyond

BYLINE: By BARBARA LLOYD 

 BODY:
Russell Coutts was driving to a boatyard in Auckland, New Zealand, last Wednesday to spend the day testing sails on the water. En route, he decided to return a phone call from the United States.
The sound of shuffling noises emanated from his cellular phone during the call; Coutts was shifting things off the front seat of his car to make room for Brad Butterworth, his team's tactician. Politely, he apologized for the interruption. The phone conversation ended in about 10 minutes, but the two yachtsmen kept driving. Fifteen minutes later, the American's phone rang again in the United States. Unknown to Coutts, the redial button on his cell phone had been switched on. 
 The car noise had been replaced with the screeching sound of a mainsail going up its track, lines flopping on deck and Kiwi crew members chattering like old pals at a men's club. It was a bit of serendipity, an opportunity to listen in like a sea gull on a stanchion to the skipper and the team that had won the America's Cup so resoundingly in 1995. But alas, the talk was mostly garble.
The next best place to tune in to Coutts and his crew will be in Florida during the GMC Yukon Key West Race Week, the next stop on Coutts's international agenda. Talk about jet lag: this week Auckland, next week Key West for the start tomorrow of the five-day grand prix competition.
"Key West is one of the top regattas in the world in terms of being competitive and seeing who's out there," the 38-year-old Coutts said from Auckland. "It's necessary to be there and to see the new technology."
Key West is one of three major events on the water right now, including the Whitbread Round the World Race, which restarts on Jan. 31 from Auckland, and the New York to San Francisco Race, which began yesterday from New York.
The Key West regatta expects more than 260 boats and 4,000 sailors to compete on three courses. The boats are divided among 18 classes, many of which are rated as one-designs such as the Corel 45, the Farr 40, the Melges 36 and the Mumm 30.
Other boats race under handicap rules such as the International Measurement System and the Performance Handicap Racing Fleet. Tom Whidden, chief executive officer of North Sails, and a former tactician for Dennis Conner, said that regardless of boat choice, the sport of yachting is on the rebound.
"I attribute a lot of that to the economy," Whidden said. "But I also attribute it to the fact that sailing is a sport that endures. People went away from it for a variety of reasons. But it seems like a lot of the players are coming back."
Part of the draw may be the ever-increasing fascination with one-design sailboats. But growing hype about the 1999-2000 America's Cup races also seems to be having its effect. Of the eight One Design 48 yachts expected to compete in Key West, five will field mostly America's Cup crews. Among the possible 1999 America's Cup skippers on site will be John Kolius, Dawn Riley, Jeff Madrigali, Chris Law, Ed Baird and Buddy Melges.
Coutts will sail as helmsman of Numbers, a 49-foot Jim Taylor design. The boat, which was overall winner in the I.M.S. division last year, has been a trend setter. At the Admiral's Cup regatta in England last summer, Coutts's team showed up with an unconventional mast shape -- chubby at the base and tapered at the top.
Other I.M.S. owners tried to copy the new style in hopes of reaping a credit advantage under the rating rule. But the modification was ultimately seen by I.M.S. rule-makers as a loophole, which they then tried to eliminate. Coutts said that the mast still is a rule-beater, but other sailors feel the change left them with an expensive but useless adaptation.
"The I.M.S. people take all the heat for it when something like that happens," Whidden said, "but people should have realized it."
The alternative is campaigning with a one-design sailboat, which cannot be modified. But even that plan is bringing on signs of caution.
"I think one-design sailboats are great," Coutts said. "I've been sailing them all my life and grew up sailing dinghies.
"But it's beginning to look like there are too many one-design fleets. The fun of those boats is to bring together large fleets. But when designers keep coming up with new boats, people move on to the next design, and you end up with a whole lot of smaller fleets."

HEADLINE: THEATER;
In 'Ragtime,' a Cast From American History

BYLINE: By ANDREA STEVENS 

 BODY:
WHEN THE MUSICAL "RAGTIME" OPENS TONIGHT, inaugurating the new Ford Center for the Performing Arts, there will be a crowd of familiar names in the character list: Booker T. Washington, Emma Goldman, Houdini, Admiral Peary. These and other figures from early in America's 20th century will flicker in and out of the show, based on E. L. Doctorow's best-selling 1975 novel of the same name.
In fact, the lives of these influential men and women will intertwine with those of three fictional families, as depicted in the musical's book by Terrence McNally: the prosperous white WASP's of New Rochelle, N.Y. (Father, Mother, Mother's Younger Brother and the Little Boy); the enterprising black musician, the woman he loves and their son (Coalhouse Walker Jr., Sarah and Little Coalhouse), and the Jewish immigrant father and young daughter seeking sanctuary in the new world (Tateh and the Little Girl). The clash of races, classes and ideas, the extremes of poverty and wealth, the intense industrialization -- all are set against the period's new rhythm that signaled a new era: ragtime. 
 With a score by Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens and a cast that includes Brian Stokes Mitchell, Peter Friedman, Marin Mazzie, Audra McDonald, Mark Jacoby and Judy Kaye under the direction of Frank Galati, the musical attempts to portray the creation of modern America nearly a century ago.
Among the many supporting characters, nine historical figures stand out. Here are the actors who portray them and the real individuals (insets) on whom they were based. ANDREA STEVENS
 
Harry Houdini
(1874-1926)
(portrayed by Jim Corti)
 Born in Budapest, Erich Weiss, who took his stage name from the 19th-century French conjurer Houdin, was an American vaudeville headliner and celebrated escape artist who toured Europe and Australia. In "Ragtime," he performs in Atlantic City before an audience that includes the Little Boy. His trick is to extricate himself from a box in which he is imprisoned and manacled, a hopeful metaphor, perhaps, for many poor immigrants.
 
Admiral Robert E. Peary
(1856-1920)
(Rod Campbell)
 For decades, the certainty that Peary had been the first person to reach the North Pole was as solid as Arctic ice. Then last year came a 20-year study by Robert M. Bryce that said neither the admiral nor his rival, Frederick Cook, had accomplished the feat. Defenders of both explorers dispute the conclusions of "Cook and Peary: The Polar Controversy, Resolved," but "Ragtime" does not take sides. In the musical, Father embarks with the explorer from New York Harbor, leaving Mother in charge at home. It is a turning point for Mother and ultimately affects the lives of all three families depicted in the show.
 
Emma Goldman
(1869-1940)
(Judy Kaye)
 Goldman, who was born in Lithuania and immigrated to America in 1886, saw labor conditions first-hand in her adopted country while working in clothing factories in Rochester. An anarchist and a galvanizing public speaker, she was arrested and ultimately deported after speaking publicly in favor of birth control and, in 1917, for obstructing the draft. As the tempo of American industrialization increased, she campaigned for the rights of the working class. In the musical, Younger Brother is inspired by her.
 
Stanford White
(1853-1906)
(Kevin Bogue)
 A passionate lover of beauty in all its guises, White was a partner in the influential architectural firm of McKim, Mead & White. The Century Club and Washington Square Arch are among the firm's existing structures in New York that display White's particular interest in decorative elements. Another of these was Evelyn Nesbit. White, a hedonist drawn to very young women, was married when the affair began. In the musical, the Nesbit character cheerfully sings the song "The Crime of the Century," describing how White met his destiny at the hands of her husband, Harry K. Thaw. The year was 1906. There were 94 more to go.
 
Evelyn Nesbit
(1885-1967)
(Lynnette Perry)
 The former Floradora Girl became the mistress of the architect Stanford White when she was 16. Titillating details of their love life became public once her husband murdered White. Nesbit, it turned out, had amused White by swinging naked on a red velvet seat suspended from the ceiling. Eager for a stage career, even if it meant trading on her own notoriety, Nesbit rode a swing in her vaudeville act and later inspired the 1955 movie "The Girl in the Red Velvet Swing." In "Ragtime," Younger Brother, not surprisingly, becomes enamored of her.
 
Harry K. Thaw
(1871-1947)
(Colton Green)
 When Thaw died at 76, his obituary in The New York Times noted that he had inspired a new term, "dementia Americana." Vain, extravagantly rich and prone to jealousy, he brooded on the fact that his wife, Evelyn Nesbit, whom he married in 1905, had once been the mistress of the celebrated architect Stanford White. In 1906, after a performance of "Mam'zelle Champagne" on the roof of the old Madison Square Garden (which White had designed), Thaw, in the presence of his wife and the audience, drew a revolver and shot White, who had been sitting at a table watching the show. Ultimately acquitted, Thaw spent some years in an insane asylum.
 
Henry Ford
(1863-1947)
(Larry Daggett)
 By cutting production costs, adapting the assembly line to automobile manufacture and designing a standardized car, Ford's company became the largest automobile producer in the world. No lover of unions, Ford resisted them in his factories until 1941. The Model T, which Ford himself designed in 1908, plays a crucial part in the musical, once it is bought and driven onstage by the ragtime musician Coalhouse Walker. Would the industrialist have cared that the Broadway show inaugurating a theater named after his company portrays him as ruthless?
 
J. P. Morgan
(1837-1913)
(Mike O'Carroll)
 Morgan built his father's banking enterprise into a financial, industrial and railroad empire, at one point saving the United States Government from bankruptcy by arranging a loan. He was a renowned art collector who kept many of his expensive purchases in the Pierpont Morgan Library in Manhattan, which did not open to the public until after his death. The building is the setting for a major confrontation in "Ragtime" among Coalhouse Walker, Booker T. Washington, Younger Brother and Father.
 
Booker T. Washington
(1856-1915)
(Tommy Hollis)
 The son of a slave, Washington put himself through school after the Civil War by working, among other places, in the Virginia coal mines. In 1881 he was appointed the first president of an industrial school in Tuskegee, Ala., and turned it into the famous Tuskegee Institute. He was criticized in his lifetime by many prominent blacks for putting education and economic parity ahead of social equality. A recurring figure in "Ragtime," he speaks intensely about the country's racial problems.

HEADLINE: Social Security Fantasy

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Representative Jerrold Nadler (letter, Jan. 13) argues that the projected Social Security trust fund shortfall will be reduced from 2.2 percent to 1.5 percent of taxable payroll merely by assuming that the economy will continue to grow at close to the 2.5 percent average annual rate of the past 25 years. 
 However, economic growth is a function of both growth in output per worker (productivity) and growth in the number of workers (labor force). With birth rates in the United States barely at the replacement level, labor force growth will slow sharply in the coming decades, eventually dropping to almost zero unless immigration policies are radically liberalized. Therefore, productivity growth would have to rise even beyond the historic peak levels of the 1950's and 1960's in order to sustain the overall economic growth rates that Mr. Nadler posits for the next century.
Thus, the pleasant prospect of just growing our way out of the Social Security financing gap is remote, and it should not beguile our political leaders into deferring the heavy lifting needed to restore the system's solvency.

HEADLINE: Video World Is Smitten by a Gun-Toting, Tomb-Raiding Sex Symbol

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
Her name is Lara Croft, and she seems to be everywhere.
Her image is popping up in magazines, on television and computer screens, even on pinup posters like the one in the current issue of PC Games magazine, which shows her reclining in a bikini, a handgun resting suggestively on her hip. 
 There's talk about a movie offer, a modeling contract and perhaps even a marketing deal that might some day have her hawking clothes and soft drinks.
And she's not even real. Ms. Croft is a digitized female image from one of the hottest-selling video games of the year, Tomb Raider 2, which is published by Eidos Interactive, based in London.
But that has not stopped Ms. Croft -- whose tanned, voluptuous cyberframe is the equivalent of 34-24-34 -- from becoming a popular female icon. She is a far cry from Betty Boop, and she is no Barbie doll. She is more like a female Indiana Jones, but pumped up, vertically and horizontally, in the fashion of the 1990's.
Her fans say she is gritty, sexy, sassy, smart and, well, virtually real. And that's exactly what her British creators were hoping for.
"It's really a strange phenomenon because people talk about her as if she's a real person," said Cindy Church, a spokeswoman for Eidos. "A lot of people who play video games fantasize about her."
Unsure of just how to portray the silicon icon, Ms. Church went on, "She's not overly sexual," then paused. "O.K., she is physically sexual, but she has a personality behind her."
Because of those attributes, Eidos executives are being flooded with gifts and presents for the silicon princess. There are flowers, Christmas gifts, even vows from young boys and men. "People all over the world have sent in their pictures," said Tricia Gray at the Eidos office in San Francisco. "She's had dozens of marriage proposals and all these cheesy letters."
Indeed, in Britain, only the bubbly Spice Girls are said to be more popular. And in the United States, her Indiana Jones-like video exploits are being sold in large quantities to game players who are well into their 30's.
Ms. Croft's first game, Tomb Raider, was released in November 1996 and sold about 3.5 million copies worldwide. Tomb Raider 2, which came out last November, has sold several million, according to Eidos.
As a result, just about every game and computer magazine wants to reprint Ms. Croft's sexy image. There are even entire World Wide Web sites devoted to her and sites created by individuals who even take the liberty of posing the digital Ms. Croft in the nude.
"The most obvious reason Lara Croft is so popular is that 99.5 percent of the gaming population is young men," says Steve Klett, editor of PC Games magazine, which has Ms. Croft gracing its cover this month. "And it doesn't hurt that she's so outrageously proportioned."
Indeed, the craze surrounding Ms. Croft (there is also an on-line newspaper dedicated to chronicling her life) might be yet another sign that technological advances in human imagery are creating lifelike portraits that further blur the line between reality and fantasy.
Devoted fans, who see a three-dimensional image and hear a real British voice projecting out of their computer speakers, have dubbed Ms. Croft a "cyberbabe" and the "silicon chick."
And to bolster such realism, Ms. Croft has her own biography and a rebellious past. Born into an aristocratic family in Wimbledon, England, Ms. Croft -- whose given age is 29 -- grew up in a world of private tutors, boarding schools and a Swiss finishing school.
But on a skiing trip to the Himalayas, her plane crashed. Ms. Croft, who was the sole survivor, soon realized that she could not stand the "suffocating atmosphere of the upper-class British society" and preferred a new adventurous life. Thus she began searching for ancient artifacts and fighting villains and a zoo of animals, like tigers and wolves.
But her creators say that Ms. Croft's future is not about slaying dragons but winning eyeballs. "The digital Lara is going to sign a modeling contract with a big agency," Ms. Church boasts. "She'll become a supermodel, like Naomi Campbell and Linda Evangelista."
Even her creators think she's real.

HEADLINE: MEDIA: BROADCASTING;
Last week's deals proved that the networks can't live without high-rated programs.

BYLINE: By Bill Carter 

DATELINE: PASADENA, Calif.

 BODY:
AT the end of the week of spending extravagantly, the networks rested -- and wondered what they had wrought.
With a few causal strokes of a pen last week, each of the four broadcast networks spent more money on programming than they had ever spent before -- three for N.F.L. football, one for television's most popular entertainment program, "E.R." 
 Every price set a record. The commitments added up to more than $8 billion for ABC, more than $4 billion for Fox, $4 billion exactly for CBS and just under $900 million for NBC.
For Don Ohlmeyer, the president of NBC's West Coast division, the binge spending that began 1998 will force the networks, who have coped with dwindling audiences for nearly two decades, to approach their business in entirely new ways.
"This business has changed more in the past 24 months than it changed in the previous 24 years," he said. "And the companies that are going to succeed are the companies that can successfully reinvent themselves. Whether that's in programming. Whether that's in ways that they sell advertising. Whether that's in ways they generate revenue."
But that reinvention will have to come quickly to help pay the tab for last week's excesses.
And even though it was spending the least, NBC had the most questions to answer. The network absorbed the loss of Sunday afternoon football after a 34-year run just two weeks after learning that it would lose its most successful program of the last decade, "Seinfeld," at the end of the season.
NBC's decision to spend a previously undreamed of total of $13 million for each episode to retain rights to "E.R." was certainly related to the loss of "Seinfeld."
"Clearly, you don't want to lose both 'Seinfeld' and 'E.R.,' " Mr. Ohlmeyer said.
But paying that enormous price for "E.R." on top of the disappearance of "Seinfeld" -- means NBC's two biggest profit-centers will be wiped out next season.
Add that to widespread predictions that the three other networks face the serious prospect of losses over their N.F.L. contracts if the national economy encounters even a lull in its current bullet-train run, and you have a plot-line for the next great television disaster movie.
"The I.R.S. makes the determination that if once every five years you make a profit, you're a business," Mr. Ohlmeyer said. "If not, you're a hobby. We don't want to be a hobby."
This is the current state of commentary on a business that was once jokingly called a license to print money. How did it come to this?
As Mr. Ohlmeyer put it, "In today's environment, you are what you program."
Last week proved that the networks simply can not live without high-rated programming. If they do not have it, they must buy it. The result, of course, is that those with the desirable programming enjoy overwhelming leverage over those who need it. It's a seller's market.
The need for programming that attracts mass audiences has only grown with the number of viewing choices. "As audiences get smaller and smaller at the networks and there are more of these tiny networks running around, I think what's left becomes extremely valuable," said Robert C. Wright, the president of NBC.
With all this competition, network television's ability to command the kind of mass audiences that drive their advertising revenues dwindled. And even though the few hit shows left that can has command a mass audience are also suffering a ratings decline, their value is increasing.
"We have an anomaly in mass-media enterprises," said Robert Broder, a prominent agent in the television business, who heads the firm Broder, Kurland, Webb, Uffner. "Because of fractionalization, programs that are at the highest level are more valuable in a down market than they were in an up market, even when they are performing less well in absolute terms."
Football was clearly deemed Must-Have TV, at virtually any price. NBC executives said in interviews that they could not value beyond $300 million a year the American Football Conference package they abandoned to CBS for a price of $500 million.
Of course, NBC had been all too willing to pay more than $500 million to wrest away "Monday Night Football" from ABC because it would have instantly helped shore up NBC's prime-time program lineup.
The football negotiations also helped drive NBC to secure "E.R." before it could be bid into the ionosphere by another network. Mr. Ohlmeyer said he was "deathly afraid that we would get 'Monday Night Football' and we'd have a crazed ABC out there."
ABC might have been just crazed enough to pay, say, $20 million an episode for "E.R."
"E.R." now costs about $2 million an episode. At $13 million, Mr. Ohlmeyer emphasized NBC "will not lose money."
But will it make any? Maybe, if NBC can come up some creative way to attract more revenue, like keeping more of the commercial time that used to be sold by NBC's stations, or perhaps shoving the 11 P.M. local news back by one minute on Thursday nights so more commercial time can be squeezed into the highly-rated "E.R."
The other networks are talking about similarly elaborate strategies to maximize their revenues from football.
Mr. Wright, ruefully describing the out-of-control negotiating process, likened the networks to participants at a kind of wild, drunken party.
"Everybody's too happy, everybody looks too good, people who never smoke cigarettes are now smoking cigars, people are making promises to each other," Mr. Wright said.
"And the next morning you have to wake up and face the reality."

HEADLINE: A Classified Advertising Free-for-All

BYLINE: By ERIC HUBLER 

 BODY:
For more than two decades, consumers around the world in search of widgets, wombats or wives have turned to their local free-ads papers -- and have often got what they wished.
For almost as long, newspaper publishers have considered free-ads papers minor pests -- if they even knew about them. Though they look like tabloid newspapers, these papers have more in common with fliers for a swap meet or a yard sale than with a traditional newspaper. 
 But, while these papers have been flying under the radar of everyone but their devoted readers for years, the format, invented by a self-described hippie, has become so profitable that papers are being snapped up by multinationals or expanding into chains in their own right.
The free-ads paper is not, itself, free; that's its doppelganger, the "shopper," typified by the Harmon and Pennysaver papers given out at supermarkets. Rather, it is the ads that are free, an abhorrent notion to most publishers. By letting individuals place free classifieds, then charging them $1 or $2 to buy the paper at a newsstand or at a news box, free-ads publishers turn the classified ads themselves into content around which advertising can be sold to businesses.
One prominent player, the London-based Loot Group, takes in $52 million annually from its 14 British and Irish editions, 55 percent from the cover price and 45 percent from display ads, according to its managing director, Heidi Bergemann.
What has really helped fuel the growth of the papers is an Amsterdam-based trade organization called the Free Ads Paper International Association, or Fapia, which represents about a third of the world's free-ads papers. The group's 80 member publishers put out titles in 140 cities, with circulations ranging from 6,000 to 450,000.
The publications are not as big a phenomenon in the United States, but they are published in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Nev., Indianapolis and Charleston, S.C., though not all are members of the association.
Readers attracted to the idea of getting something for nothing are people like Peter Hoffman, a Manhattan private investigator who is so hooked on Loot's year-old New York edition that he has his electronic scheduler remind him of the deadline each Monday. The paper is published on Wednesday. So far he has sold a camera, a couch and the boxes he used in a recent move. Now he is trying to unload an Amtrak ticket. "It's like a permanent yard sale for me," Mr. Hoffman said. "I never got rid of so much junk in my life."
In addition to providing technical support and setting standards (members may not, for example, publish ads relating to drugs, weapons, prostitution or pedophilia), Fapia is a trade association with a twist, Ms. Bergemann said.
With the aid of a coupon developed by the organization, a reader of any member paper may submit an ad for free publication in any other paper (though if the ad goes to multiple papers it costs a few dollars). This allows lonely hearts in Milan to read the plaintive wishes of their counterparts in Tokyo or New York.
Although the exchange ads account for only 1 percent of the membership's total weekly volume of four million ads ("Nobody's going to fly to Paris to buy a used fridge," Ms. Bergemann said) the 40,000 international ads certainly add color, creating a mosaic of the state of the economy and the human psyche worldwide. Some recent ads from Loot's New York edition include:
*SOS, I'm looking for kind space people who can heal me. I'm troubled with strange disease (Japan).
*A white male, 28, is looking for marriage w American lady and move to Hollywood to become famous movie stars (Belgium).
*Russian woman 30, Lidia, w son, lonely, sks a man for relationship, more, what are you interested, sorry, I don't speak English.
*We both, 29 and 28, gay guys, very cute, search you 2 lesbians for marriage, we are from Munich, Germany.
A recent edition of London's Loot, the chain's flagship paper, filled 96 tabloid-size pages. It included ads for selling or swapping everything from cameras to cars and vacation homes to fitness equipment. It also had 11 pages of personal ads, almost all from people seeking relationships.
And in a small section titled "Message noticeboard," ads ranged from the poetic ("Cramped is this life at home, dusty indeed its spheres, life gone forth is wide open") to the cryptic ("suits you") to the polemical ("Politics is the shadow cast upon society by big business.").
The first free-ads paper, Buy and Sell Press in Vancouver, British Columbia, remains solely owned by its founder, Mike Abbott, who thought the enterprise would foster social interaction and create a kind of people's capitalism.
The idea was copied elsewhere in western Canada and California in the 1970's. It skipped much of the rest of North America but flowered in Europe.
In gratitude, the free-ads association made Mr. Abbott its honorary president. "They owe me millions, those blokes," he said. "Some of these papers have changed hands for hundreds of millions of dollars since 1985," when the association was founded.
Mr. Abbott will not spell out his own profit, but he says the industry's arithmetic is as simple as it is sweet: a well-run paper sells two copies for every ad it carries, has a circulation of 25,000 to 30,000 per million of population, and enjoys a profit of 20 percent.
Corporate interest in the format is clear. Consider the fate of one of Buy and Sell's earliest imitators, the Recycler. Born in a phone conversation, during which Mr. Abbott casually advised an admirer to start a free-ads paper in Los Angeles, the Recycler now has 10 regional editions, plus 35 other papers of various formats, and is majority-owned by a Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette investment fund.
The big buyout story, though, is Secondamano. Founded in Milan in the late 1970's, it mushroomed to eight cities in Italy, one in Switzerland, and 11 in Russia and Kazakhstan. The ex-Soviet papers turned out to be the jewels of the free-ads world -- the Moscow edition, like Loot's London flagship, went from a weekly to a daily to handle the volume -- and caught the eye of Paris-based Hebdo Mag International (now a unit of the Cendant Corporation).
Hebdo, though best known for its paid-advertising titles like Wheels 'n Deals, already owned, co-owned or was about to own free-ads papers in Paris, Warsaw, Budapest, Amsterdam, Puerto Rico and Buenos Aires. Hebdo acquired Secondamano last January, making it easily the largest free-ads publisher. Cendant does not break out revenues by operating division, and Hebdo officials declined to specify what the company paid for its acquisitions.
The format's strongest endorsement comes from an American newspaper that bucked traditions and says it has benefited as a result. That newspaper, The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, now gives away more than a million ads a year, and revenue from business classifieds attracted by the liveliness of the individual ads continues to rise.
The paper began its give-away practice shortly after The Arkansas Democrat bought the assets of its competitor, The Arkansas Gazette, in 1991. At the time, The Democrat was already running free classifieds.
Paul Smith, the general manager of The Democrat-Gazette, said that the free ads "created new readers because people who were interested in something would start to buy our paper even if they subscribed to the other, because we might on a typical day have 300 pet ads while the other would have 15."
Mr. Smith said that although some other newspapers offered free classifieds for inexpensive items, his was the only one that offered a true free-for-all. So why don't more dailies do likewise? "It sounds kind of bizarre," Mr. Smith concedes. "I think a lot of people are afraid to step out and take a chance."

HEADLINE: Taking In the Sites;
Internet Can Help Sort Out Economic Turmoil in Asia

BYLINE: By SREENATH SREENIVASAN 

 BODY:
The economic crisis in Asia has generated a great deal of interest in news about the region, and many people are increasingly turning to the World Wide Web for timely information.
As in most recent crises, the turmoil in Asia highlights the best of the Internet (global reach, firsthand sources, instant access) and the worst (irrelevant search results, selective updates, repetitive data, inaccurate rumors). As with most subjects, it is best to have a map and some experts to help you out. 
 "The Web has been most useful for keeping track of the crisis," said Nouriel Roubini, a professor of international economics at the Stern School of Business at New York University. "The amount of data and information available is quite impressive."
Professor Roubini maintains a site for his class that even people without an M.B.A. will find helpful in learning about the crisis. What the site lacks in fancy design it makes up in analysis, extensive links and a detailed chronology. The main question his site tries to answer: "What caused Asia's economic and currency crisis and its global contagion?"
Even economists who suffer from information overload can find the Web has a purpose when it comes to the crisis. "You are going to pick up a wider range of perspectives with the Internet than with other systems," said Ronald R. Reuss, chief economist for Piper Jaffray, a brokerage firm based in Minneapolis. He uses the Web mainly to supplement the more sophisticated information resources -- like Bloomberg News and Reuters -- he has at his disposal.
Rajiv J. Chaudhri, a former Goldman, Sachs semiconductor analyst and now president of Digital Century Capital, a technology hedge fund, keeps a close eye on the events in Asia. "For me, the Web is a very important research tool," he said. "I need to know what is happening there because it impacts a lot of technology companies here." His Web visits include English-language papers published in Asia.
Several news sites, both here and abroad, offer good starting points. For example, The New York Times on the Web has a section on its site dedicated to the topic. It has articles dating back to December as well as opinion articles and forums in which visitors can discuss the crisis.
The search engine Yahoo offers a collection of the latest news items relating to the situation. An on-line news agency based in London called Out There News has a handy country-by-country guide so you can see that despite being called the "Asian financial crisis," it has not yet affected the entire continent.
Several Asia-based news sites worth visiting are linked from the Times site. Also, check out the site of The Far Eastern Economic Review, the Hong Kong-based publication owned by Dow Jones & Company, which provides coverage of different sectors of the economy. Articles from The Asian Wall Street Journal are available on The Wall Street Journal's Web site -- for a fee.
To go beyond the headlines, some sites provide tools to analyze the data. Indonesia Net Exchange carries stock quotes, research reports and links to listed companies and the Jakarta Stock Exchange. And Bloomberg's site offers some resources that are accessible without paying the $1,200 a month for a dedicated terminal. For instance, an on-line calculator gives rates for more than 215 currencies. So visitors can find out how the Malaysian ringgit is doing against the South Korean won or even the Cape Verde escudo.
To learn about how the crisis is affecting the United States, a site called the Dismal Scientist, which bills itself as the "Web's authoritative source for economic information," has a section dealing with the effect of the crisis on different regions of the country.
The sites of the international organizations that are such crucial players all have Web sites, but they vary in usefulness.
The International Monetary Fund site has a section called "I.M.F. Bailouts: Truth and Fiction" that answers critics unhappy with the assistance packages provided to South Korea, Indonesia and Thailand. The World Bank basically has an archive of news releases and statements by its top executives on the crisis. The Bank for International Settlements, a sort of central bank for the world's central banks, has comprehensive reports on the assets and liabilities of banks of the affected countries.
Getting worthwhile information from the pertinent institutions in Asia is difficult because the sites do not have easy-to-find sections on the subject at hand. A visit to the Asian Development Bank in Manila, the Bank of Thailand in Bangkok or the South Korean Ministry of Finance and Economy in Seoul yields little that is current or that has been updated in recent days.
For another perspective on the situation in Asia, check out The International Workers Bulletin, the journal of the World Socialist Web site. It addresses "the urgent need for a revolutionary socialist response to the crisis of the world capitalist system," and has a series of articles about the consequences of the situation for workers.
Asia Online, a site on the Asian Buying Consortium, has a forum specifically to discuss "Asian market rumors" where advice is freely offered by other Web surfers.
The difficulties in Asia are sure to be a major topic at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. The conference attracts some of the biggest names in business and government, and its Web site may be worth keeping an eye on when the conference starts on Jan. 29.

HEADLINE: 'Titanic' Wins Top Golden Globe Award

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: BEVERLY HILLS, Jan. 18

 BODY:
In an evening that was expected to pit the big guns of expensive Hollywood dramas against the depth of small, independently produced works, an array of big and small films took Golden Globe awards here tonight, with "Titanic," a $200 million costume drama, winning as top film drama but several smaller movies taking most other awards.
"Does this prove once and for all that size matters?" asked James Cameron, who also won a Golden Globe as best director for "Titanic." 
 But the award for best dramatic actor went to a man who has been absent from films for years, Peter Fonda, well known for his iconic role in the 1960's film "Easy Rider." He won the award for his part as a quiet, courageous beekeeper in "Ulee's Gold," a small-budget film.
"God, it's good to be back," said Mr. Fonda, in accepting his trophy, and then added, "I wish my dad were here tonight," referring to the legendary Henry Fonda.
Judi Dench won for best dramatic actress for her role as Queen Victoria in "Mrs. Brown." And the award for best screenplay went to two first-timers, Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, who originally wrote what became "Good Will Hunting" while undergraduates. The film, a stirring tale of how a tough orphan from the streets of South Boston comes to terms with the abuse he suffered as a child, love and his inexplicable facility as a mathematical genius, was another small-budget drama that is expected to be a strong contender at the Oscars.
The closest thing to a sweep in the evening was scored by "As Good as It Gets," a dark, odd comedy about an intensely neurotic novelist falling in love with a salty waitress. The film, a large-budget studio movie directed and co-written by James L. Brooks, won as best musical or comedy. Its stars, Jack Nicholson (who also appeared with Mr. Fonda in "Easy Rider") and Helen Hunt, won for best actor and actress in the category. Although the awards, given by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, have raised questions because the association is little recognized and has fewer than 100 voting members, they are seen as harbingers of the more popular Oscars given in the spring. As such, they gave little hint of how the voting might go at that time, but did provide Hollywood an opportunity to do something it clearly enjoys, party.
The mood was relaxed and festive, but few people appeared to be enjoying themselves more than the cast of "The Full Monty," an independent film about a group of unemployed workers in Sheffield, England, who decide to put on a striptease performance.
Wearing big smiles as they sauntered down the red carpet before the show, the film's cast members were asked at one point how they got here. The Beatles-like reply: "By aeroplane." The light moment captured the sense of the evening, one of the few that mixes television and movie personalities.
Among the more popular choices of the evening was Burt Reynolds, who has had many ups and downs in his long career and who won as best supporting actor for his role as the paternalistic pornographic filmmaker in "Boogie Nights." The best supporting actress trophy went to Kim Basinger, who played a big-hearted call girl in "L.A. Confidential."
In the realm of the small screen, the award for best television mini-series or movie went to "George Wallace," which starred Gary Sinise and was produced for TNT.
But the best actor in a mini-series or movie for television went to Ving Rhames, who until now has generally had modest roles but put in both a lighthearted and powerful performance as the boxing promoter Don King in "Don King: Only in America," for HBO.
Then, in one of the most strikingly anti-Hollywood gestures of the evening, Mr. Rhames, tears streaming down his face, called the actor Jack Lemmon to the stage (a nominee for his part in "12 Angry Men") and gave his trophy to Mr. Lemmon.
"I knew Don King was a character," a stunned Mr. Lemmon commented, "but I didn't know you were crazy."
The best supporting actress in a television mini-series or movie went to Alfre Woodard for the HBO film "Miss Evers' Boys," for which she won an Emmy award.
"Ally McBeal," one of the few new shows to receive nominations, won as best television comedy. Calista Flockhart, the star of the show, won for best actress in a comedy. The award for best actor in a comedy went to Michael J. Fox, in "Spin City."
The best television dramatic series went, for the second consecutive year, to "The X-Files," the occasionally bizarre, conspiratorial show about two F.B.I. agents chasing -- always with straight faces -- everything from aliens to mutants.
The award for best actress in a television drama went to Christine Lahti in "Chicago Hope." She delivered the most amusing moment when she failed to rush to the stage, bringing a long span of ad libbing until she finally showed up and reported, "You know, I was in the bathroom, Mom."
Anthony Edwards won for best actor in a television drama for his role in "E.R."

HEADLINE: ALBANY IS FAULTED FOR NOT PREPARING TO MEET RECESSION

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 18

 BODY:
For some time, it has seemed that all the fiscal news from here was good. The state is running a big budget surplus for the third year in a row. Gov. George E. Pataki boasts that he has slowed the upward spiral of spending and that the state's emergency reserve fund is larger than ever.
Yet financial experts on Wall Street, in academia and elsewhere warn that while most other states have used the healthy economy of the last seven years to get their financial affairs in order, New York remains woefully ill prepared to survive another recession like the one that struck in the early 1990's. When the next downturn hits, they predict, New York may be forced to swallow the same bitter medicine it did the last time: deep spending cuts, reneging on promised tax cuts, even tax increases. 
 "In terms of its ability to weather a recession, I would say New York is in a three-way tie for last place with California and Louisiana," said Renee A. Boicourt, managing director for state ratings at Moody's Investors Service. Moody's and Standard & Poor's, the two major bond rating agencies, give New York the second-lowest credit rating of any state, ahead of only Louisiana, a reflection of their view of the state's long-term fiscal health.
As the Governor prepares to release his election-year budget on Tuesday, there is no question that New York's condition is better now than it was a few years ago. Independent fiscal monitors give credit to Mr. Pataki, saying he has been more fiscally responsible than his predecessor, Mario M. Cuomo, and to a Wall Street boom that has raised the incomes of traders and investors, swelling payments of state income tax.
But the same experts suggest that the stock market's largess has papered over serious problems, some recent, some a legacy accumulated over decades.
*The state owes $33 billion, far more than any other state and the fifth-highest per capita amount. It spends more than $2 billion a year just to make payments on that debt.
*New York's unemployment insurance fund ranks dead last among the states, with a balance large enough to cover just one month's worth of claims, according to the Federal Department of Labor. To reach the national average of 20 months, New York would need to pour billions of dollars into the fund.
*The $67.4 billion budget enacted last year included huge new tax cuts and education programs that will cost $6 billion a year by 2002, with no plan to pay for them.
The Governor and leaders of the Legislature insist that continued economic growth and management of spending will keep the state solvent. In fact, the Democratic Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver, often accuses Mr. Pataki of an excess of caution, claiming that there is more money available than the Governor lets on.
"We have fought to make sure that the budgets we put together here were based on conservative revenue estimates," said Donna Arduin, Mr. Pataki's first deputy budget director. "We have managed spending very carefully, and the result has been growing surpluses every year."
She noted that skeptics were wrong in saying the state would be unable to absorb the 25 percent income tax cut enacted from 1995 through last year.
But Andrew Rein, senior research associate at the Citizens Budget Commission, said that achievement was possible only on the back of a historic performance by the stock market. "The state acts like that's going to go on forever, and it can't," he said.
Tom Carroll, president of Change-NY, a conservative anti-tax group, said the state's current fiscal condition had an unsettling parallel in the 1980's. "There was a fantastic run-up in the stock market, just like there is now, and the state was increasing spending," he said. "And then, as it always does, the cycle turned, the market dropped, we had a recession and suddenly the state had a huge deficit. The tax cuts that were scheduled were postponed, there were cuts in programs, cuts in school aid."
All indications are that, as in most election years, lawmakers will adopt a budget for the fiscal year that begins April 1 that will please voters, but not fiscal watchdogs. The Republican majority leader of the Senate, Joseph L. Bruno, has called for more tax cuts, and Mr. Pataki, a Republican, has said that he, too, will seek tax cuts. Mr. Silver wants a major increase in education spending.
And aides to the Governor say that with the state awash in cash, Mr. Pataki will show no appetite for the kind of spending cuts he once advocated. Indeed, he has already indicated that he will propose large increases in spending for education and road repairs.
Economists warn that New York's good times have not been broad-based enough to create the underlying strength to withstand a recession in good shape. Rather, they say, the state's prosperity has stemmed largely from a single industry, the financial markets, and much of the state's economy remains weak.
The last recession was longer and much deeper in New York than in the country as a whole, and the recovery has been less hearty. Mr. Pataki is fond of saying that the state's employment growth now ranks sixth in the nation, but he is speaking of the raw number of jobs. In percentage terms, New York remains near the bottom: over the three years Mr. Pataki has been in office, employment in the state has grown 3 percent, compared with 7 percent nationally.
"New York is particularly vulnerable to an economic downturn because the recovery we've had has been precarious," said Jennifer McCormick, an analyst at the Fiscal Policy Institute, an Albany-based research group that is financed by unions and foundations. "We're at the mercy of one industry."
The recession of 1990-91 hit state governments hard, forcing budget cuts and tax increases, and many states have made changes to prevent a repeat of that experience.
"A lot of states have really been aggressive about using the economic growth of the last several years to build up their reserve funds and to change their budget practices," said Corinna Eckl fiscal program director for the National Conference of State Legislatures in Denver.
In the last few years, several states have used surpluses to pay off debts early; in the last year, California and Connecticut retired major obligations. But New York actually increased its indebtedness with the $1.75 billion environmental bond act championed by the Governor in 1996, and with smaller borrowings buried in its budgets.
New York has had large cushions recently -- a surplus of almost $1.5 billion last year, and one projected to top that this year -- partly because Mr. Pataki has intentionally underestimated revenues. And the current year's budget sets aside $530 million to meet future obligations, a step that fiscal monitors call an almost unheard-of bit of prudence.
But New York lacks the mechanisms that many states have to enforce such caution. Ms. Eckl said that at least eight states have laws prohibiting them from spending more than a certain fraction -- usually 95 to 98 percent -- of the money that becomes available each year, with the rest set aside until the following year.
"A lot of states also require that the budget projections remain balanced three or four years out," she said, "so that if you increase spending or cut taxes, you have to balance it into the future, on paper, at least." In New York, by contrast, even the administration's own budget projections routinely show multibillion-dollar deficits in future years.
Like most states, New York has a "rainy day" fund that can be touched only in a bona fide emergency. But New York's fund, at $335 million, holds less than 1 percent of the state's $35 billion general fund, compared with a national average of almost 3 percent, according to the National Association of State Budget Officers. New Jersey and Connecticut, with much smaller budgets, have emergency funds almost as large as New York's.
Where some states have laws requiring deposits into those funds, New York does not, and in fact, its law limits deposits to 0.2 percent of the general fund each year. Mr. Pataki has made the maximum deposit, about $65 million, in each of his three years. Aides to the Governor say he will propose raising that limit to 0.5 percent.
The most obvious sign of New York's problems, its chronically late budgets, is viewed by fiscal monitors as more a symptom of trouble than an ill in itself. But even there, the rules that enforce discipline elsewhere -- the most Draconian rule, forcing government to shut down if the budget is not on time, is law in 23 states, according to Ms. Eckl -- are lacking here.
In Mr. Pataki's first two years in office, he proposed, along with income tax reductions, deep cuts in education, health care and welfare spending. A result was consecutive budgets that kept most state spending flat. (About one-third of the budget comes from the Federal Government for programs like Medicaid, and that portion continued to grow.)
Fiscal monitors generally hailed that record as a welcome change. But the current budget, adopted last summer, increased spending 5 percent.
"Spending is once again growing faster than inflation," said Mr. Rein, of the Citizens Budget Commission. "And we are very skeptical of their ability to keep the promises for the future that were enacted into law."
Those promises include $2.1 billion a year in state tax cuts, $2.7 billion a year in aid to local governments to pay for property tax cuts, and $1.2 billion in new education programs, a total of $6 billion a year in commitments to be phased in over four years.
Mr. Carroll, of Change-NY, called the spending plan irresponsible. "There is no one who is bigger tax cut fans than we are," he said, "but you simply can't cut taxes and increase spending at the same time. The math doesn't work."

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
But There Is No Peace

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
Cut through Benjamin Netanyahu's talk, and the reality is plain. The present Government of Israel is not interested in making peace with the Palestinians.
That is so for a simple reason. There is and always has been only one way to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: land for peace. And the Netanyahu Government has now made clear that it has no intention of withdrawing from enough of the land Israel occupies in the West Bank to make a deal imaginable. 
 Last week the Netanyahu Cabinet resolved that Israel must retain permanent control of all Jewish settlement areas in the West Bank, routes for future highways, security zones on the borders and "enveloping Jerusalem," water and other "infrastructure," and "historic sites sacred to the Jewish people." Israel Radio estimated that this would leave 60 percent of the West Bank under Israeli control.
The Cabinet position mocks United Nations Resolution 242, with its call for withdrawal from occupied territories to "secure and recognized" borders. The framers of the resolution and other statesmen read it to allow at most minor border adjustments.
Moreover, the part of the West Bank the Netanyahu Government would allot to Palestinians would be cut up into little islands: bantustans without economic or political viability. No conceivable Palestinian leader would consider such a proposition.
The Cabinet declaration followed another demarche by the Netanyahu Government: a list of politically impossible conditions that the Palestinian Authority must fulfill before Israel carries out its commitment to make further interim withdrawals from the West Bank.
One demand, for example, was that the Authority hand over Palestinians accused of terrorism to Israel. Yasir Arafat would probably be overthrown if he did that. Prime Minister Netanyahu would not turn over to the Palestinian Authority Israelis arrested for killing Palestinians. Israel's law forbids extradition of its citizens to any other country.
Another demand was that the Palestinian Authority suppress "hostile propaganda" by, among others, journalists and preachers. Would Mr. Netanyahu silence Israelis hostile to the Palestinians? Would he silence religious extremists of the kind who called Yitzhak Rabin a traitor for signing the Oslo Agreement?
Under the heading of "reciprocity," Mr. Netanyahu demanded that the Palestinian Authority take tougher security measures against terrorism. But as Henry Siegman of the Council on Foreign Relations pointed out in an analysis for The Boston Globe, Israeli Government officials negotiated a detailed security protocol with the Authority -- and Mr. Netanyahu rejected it.
Mr. Netanyahu's actions show that he is trying to do two things at the same time. For the sake of relations with the United States, he wants to keep alive the illusion that he is ready for peace negotiations. But he wants to assure his Government coalition, further to the right since David Levy's departure, that the idea of negotiations is going nowhere.
That poses a formidable challenge to President Clinton. He and his advisers know what Mr. Netanyahu is up to. What should he say when the Prime Minister visits him this week?
Bill Clinton is as warm a friend as Israel has had in the White House. He believes, as did his predecessors, that the long-term interest of Israel lies in peace with the Palestinians, not in unending conflict.
And an American interest is at stake, too. The United States has been, for good reasons, Israel's great supporter. It is the only power that can bring about the peace Israelis need. To allow ourselves to be diddled by Mr. Netanyahu's tactics would be humiliating not only to President Clinton but to this country.
In the circumstances, the wise course is for President Clinton to speak the truth out loud. If the Netanyahu position ends the hope of useful negotiations at this time, it is better to say so than to go on sending missions and pretending. Pretending can only delegitimize the idea of peace.
It will hardly be easy for the President. Prime Minister Netanyahu is a master of the glib, and he will be telling American audiences that he is all for peace. We shall see whether Mr. Clinton has the will to confront him with reality.

HEADLINE: Joseph Murphy, 64, Professor And Ex-Chancellor of CUNY

BYLINE: By DAVID ROHDE 

 BODY:
Joseph S. Murphy, the son of a labor organizer and a champion of the working class who became Chancellor of the City University of New York, died in an automobile accident near Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on Saturday. He was 64.
Dr. Murphy, whose doctorate was in political science, had just begun a visit to Ethiopia, during the break between CUNY's fall and spring semesters, to carry out research relating to courses in political science that he was teaching at CUNY. He had a long history of humanitarian and educational work in Ethiopia. 
 At his death he held the title of University Professor at CUNY, and was teaching graduate courses in political science at its Graduate School and University Center. He was also teaching political science courses in CUNY's worker education programs, whose students are mostly labor union members who have jobs during the day.
Known for his genial manner and visceral sympathy for the plight of students, Dr. Murphy was able to rebuild and even extend academic programs during his tenure as CUNY Chancellor from 1982 to 1990, despite the system's financial woes.
Dr. Murphy, who learned to speak Yiddish from his mother, a Polish Jew, and Gaelic from his father, an Irish longshoreman, was a political scientist and the author of two books, "The Theory of Universals in Eighteenth Century British Empiricism" (1961) and "Political Theory: A Conceptual Analysis" (1968).
He was known for his ability to combine a practical knowledge of politics with an enduring commitment to the poor and the working class. Highlights of his tenure as Chancellor included the introduction of child care services for working students and the expansion of adult literacy and collaborative programs with the public schools.
He also started a summer remedial course that taught basic skills to incoming freshmen, and a $1.5 billion capital construction program to modernize 13 of the university's 20 campuses.
In an effort to make the administration more reflective of student enrollment, he sought out members of minority groups for top positions. In an editorial marking Dr. Murphy's retirement, The New York Times stated that his "legacy of competence and commitment sets a worthy standard for his successor."
His special interests as a political scientist and an activist included the influence of the American labor movement and the American intellectual left on politics and intellectual life in the United States, including the formation of economic policy.
Born in Newark in 1933, Dr. Murphy attended the University of Colorado and received his bachelor's degree from Olivet College in Michigan in 1955. A recipient of a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship and others, Dr. Murphy received his doctorate from Brandeis University in 1961 and was an assistant professor at Brandeis until 1965.
Dr. Murphy served as director of the Peace Corps' Virgin Island Training Center on St. Croix from 1965 to 1966; as assistant office secretary in the Department of Health Education and Welfare in Washington from 1966 to 1967; as an associate director of the Job Corps in the Office of Economic Opportunity in Washington in 1967 and 1968, and as director of Peace Corps operations in Ethiopia from 1968 to 1970.
He then returned to the United States and held a series of academic posts that eventually led him to head CUNY, the nation's third largest public university.
Dr. Murphy was the Vice Chancellor for Higher Education for the State of New Jersey from 1970 to 1971. He was president of Queens College from 1971 to 1977 and president of Bennington University in Vermont from 1977 to 1982, when he was named Chancellor of CUNY.
Dr. Murphy held a number of posts in Africa. He worked as an election observer in Ethiopia in 1992 and as a consultant for the Constitutional Commission in Addis Ababa in 1993. He had also been a member of the board of the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research since 1993 and of the UNESCO Global Project since 1992.
Dr. Murphy is survived by his wife, Susan Crile; his children from a previous marriage, Lisa, of Des Moines, Susanne, of Manhattan, and Peter, of Queens; five grandchildren, and his mother, Doris Murphy of the Bronx.

HEADLINE: Proud to Be the Towns That Taste Forgot;
Wildwoods Stop Lamenting Cheap, Tacky Motels and Start Promoting Them

BYLINE: By EVELYN NIEVES 

DATELINE: WILDWOOD, N.J., Jan. 16

 BODY:
The last campaign to try to lure the tourists back here promoted the size of the island's beaches, which are so wide that patrols regularly rescue bathers overcome by heat exhaustion as they trudge to and from the water's edge.
Before that, the Mayor of Wildwood, convinced that Atlantic City, 30 miles north, was to blame for a faltering tourist season, decided to fight fire with fire: he brought in Chief Larry Snake of the Delaware tribe of western Oklahoma, who declared a two-and-a-half acre parking lot sacred ancestral land in the failed hopes of turning it into a casino. 
 Now, the answer is the epitome of tackiness.
The newest, most ambitious promotional idea ever unleashed on this barrier island holding the towns of Wildwood, North Wildwood and Wildwood Crest capitalizes on its having the largest collection of screaming, kitschy 50's and 60's motels on five square miles.
More than 250 motels operate here, competing for attention with signs as loud as a chorus of kazoos. They give the Wildwoods a Twilight Zonelike feel of a place trapped in another era, and for the longest time, they have been blamed for keeping the island from reaching its full tourist potential. But lately, with the 20th century slipping away, there has been a definite shift in attitude.
The motels (as well as the island's aluminum diners and fluorescent boardwalk buildings) are beginning to acquire the historic cachet of original Levittown Cape Cods. Architects and design students from all over marvel at them. Historians write about them. Photographers and artists study their smallest details. The question, now, is how to make tourists want to flock to them.
To Steven Izenour, a professor of architecture at the University of Pennsylvania's Graduate School of Fine Arts, the answer is plain: "Turn up the volume." He and nine students, in collaboration with professors and students from the Yale University School of Architecture, have unveiled the first half of a yearlong study for promoting the Wildwoods by exploiting the candy-colored, flat-roofed, low-rent parking garage-like commercial architecture -- especially the neon signs, plastic palm trees and kidney-shaped pools.
"Wildwood has the greatest treasure trove of 50's and 60's commercial architecture I've ever seen in one place," he said, after a two-hour public presentation of the plan here the other day. "It can be a counter-Disney. The kind of ad hoc funkiness of a place like Wildwood is what makes it so interesting. The more you have Disney, the more you need Wildwood."
The plan, endorsed by city officials, motel owners and just about everyone else who has seen it, plots the resurrection of Wildwood by such notions as making the motels' huge signs twice as big, making the plastic palm trees taller, adding loud, vintage commercial signs to the tops of buildings and painting buildings lots of bright colors.
This isn't the first time someone has suggested promoting the island's gaudiness. A few years ago, a local group began tours of what it called the island's "doo-wop" architecture. (The tours were canceled for lack of interest, but "doo-wop" has stuck.) The Doo-Wop Preservation League, where the plan was presented, is dedicated to celebrating the anticlassic buildings that some people have advocated tearing down. But the Ivy League plan goes further, by suggesting that the aging motels do need some sprucing up.
To one motel owner, Lester Katsanis, that is an idea whose time is long overdue. "We've already done $25,000 in improvements," said Dr. Katsanis, a chemist who bought the Quebec Motel 12 years ago. "We've always said there is no place like Wildwood. We've got the cleanest water, the biggest beaches and the motels that are museums of Americana. People love them."
Still, he and Tony Totah, a marine biologist who owns a five-unit apartment complex, said a tourist plan should mention some natural wonders here as well. "We've got all kinds of marine life in our waters," Mr. Totah said. "We have whales, dolphins, seals, turtles. It's great to focus on the motels, but Wildwood is great in lots of ways."
Wildwood's Mayor, Fred Wager, also wanted a wider focus of interest. "I think it's a great thing," he said of the study. "And I think there's a lot of culture here. We're creating historic districts all over. We have the cleanest, safest beach in the country. And we have more rides on our boardwalk than Disney World."
There is a peculiar habit here of comparing Wildwood with Disney at every turn, though the town is more reminiscent of pre-casino Atlantic City. It is, in every way, a summer place. Most of the stores -- and motels -- are closed until May, and more than a quarter of the population is currently unemployed. Buildings are boarded, streets are empty and seagulls waddle around with no fear of cars or people.
Ke Feng, a 24-year-old architect from Beijing on a one-year visa to study at the University of Pennsylvania, was, like many young people, utterly smitten with the anti-Disney neon of motels like the Lollipop and the Stardust. "I've only been in this country since September," he said. "I found the architecture in Wildwood very interesting. It's very different from China."
He had the unenviable task of studying the island's traffic patterns and improving the parking lots. He created, among other things, a two-tier garage painted in black and yellow diagonal stripes with huge billboards on top, changing rooms and bathrooms in lots near the beaches.
But could this be done? Mr. Izenour, who will work with Mr. Ke and a group of Yale students and colleagues on the second half of the project, has made a career of creating comprehensive studies for communities. "We did one in Atlantic City when the casinos were approved," he said. "It was completely ignored.
"But this time," he added, opening his hand to show a stack of business cards from interested parties, "this time, I think at least some of it is going to happen."

HEADLINE: This Term, a New Dynamic for Whitman and Legislature

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 18

 BODY:
When Christine Todd Whitman was sworn into office as Governor four years ago, she demanded immediate legislative action on her bold campaign pledge to cut state income taxes. Most lawmakers, cowed by her defeat of an incumbent governor, overcame their skepticism and went along with her plan.
But as Mrs. Whitman begins her second and final term on Tuesday, she can no longer issue edicts and expect her fellow Republicans in the Legislature to fall in line. Republicans control both houses, but her narrow re-election victory has tipped the balance of power toward them. And they have hinted that they are prepared to set the state's agenda for the next four years if she does not have the vision to formulate one for them. 
 Nevertheless, Mrs. Whitman said in an interview last week that she was undaunted by the challenges of being a lame-duck governor, and she dismissed the view that her political clout had been diminished.
"I got elected, and that is the bottom line," she said. "Everybody else has this thing about 'close election victory.' I really don't think it matters. I am the only Republican to carry the state of New Jersey since 1985. I have done it twice now. And this is not a state given to Republicans. Would I have loved to have won bigger? Of course."
She also said she did not care what the pundits have to say about a decline in her "national standing." She points out that the number of speaking requests from Republican Party leaders and candidates across the country has not declined.
Even before her narrow victory, Mrs. Whitman's decision to veto legislation banning a type of late-term abortion diminished her chances of winning her party's nomination for national office. The State Legislature overrode her veto last month.
Just a few days ago, the Republican National Committee considered a resolution to bar party support for anyone opposed to such a ban. Knowing she has become a popular target for more conservative members of her own party, Mrs. Whitman chose not to lobby against the resolution, which ultimately failed.
"At this point, it is better if I don't, because I tend to be a lightning rod for people on the other side," she said. "And to me, it is much more important that the party not do this for emotional reasons. It is the wrong thing to do to start setting litmus tests."
In her inaugural address, Mrs. Whitman said she would call for more preservation of open space and unveil plans to help bolster the state's ailing cities.
She has already shown a willingness to tackle unpopular issues.
In her annual address to the Legislature last week, she proposed requiring municipalities to seek voter approval for property tax increases above the rate of inflation. She called for an end to tenure for school principals and for sweeping changes in the civil service system. On auto insurance, she did not offer a specific plan, but set a March 30 deadline to sign legislation into law to reduce rates.
In her most politically contentious move, she also called for a referendum on merging some of the state's 616 school districts. She said New Jerseyans would have to give up some local control over public schools if they wanted to reduce the cost of public education, which makes up about two-thirds of local property tax bills. "Let's have the discussion," she said. "Let's not play games with the people."
While Republican legislative leaders offered broad praise for her ideas last week, they have already begun to question her proposals, particularly the forced merging of school districts.
Mrs. Whitman said she was not surprised by that reaction. "Those are not things that are going to come easily," she said. "They will take some time to get done because they are fairly major. But I am used to hearing naysayers."
Complicating Mrs. Whitman's ability to set the legislative agenda in the next four years could be the political ambitions of the two top Republican leaders. Both Assembly Speaker Jack Collins and Senate President Donald T. DiFrancesco are said to be considering a bid for the Republican gubernatorial nomination in 2001.
Mr. DiFrancesco wasted no time last week offering his own vision for the next four years. At the swearing-in ceremony for members of the Senate, he delivered a speech that focused on improving the state's transportation system, to which Mrs. Whitman has paid scant attention.
Yet despite the talk of the potential for conflict, Mr. DiFrancesco and Mr. Collins insist they each have a good working relationship with the Governor. They point out that the Legislature has already begun to play a larger role, shaping state policy in the final two years of Mrs. Whitman's first term.
"As of this moment, I don't think that it has changed very much," Mr. DiFrancesco said of the Governor's relationship with the Legislature. "She seems a little more relaxed. The way that we get along is that we talk. We have worked very closely together and we will continue to work closely together."
Stephen Salmore, a political consultant to Republican candidates and a visiting political science professor at Drew University, said that Mrs. Whitman's biggest challenge would be cajoling lawmakers to support her agenda. "She comes in without the enthusiasm and expectations that she did four years ago," he said. "And no one owes her anything."
He said he believed that Mrs. Whitman laid out interesting proposals in her speech last week. "But the reaction from lawmakers was tepid," he said. "I think the reaction reflects the skepticism about whether she will really push for her ideas."
Mrs. Whitman said she was prepared to do what it took to get the job done. "I am going to continue to speak out," she said. "I don't have to aggressively jam down everyone's throat all the good things that have happened. On the other hand, you want people to know what we have done."

HEADLINE: WAVE OF MERGERS IS RECASTING FACE OF BUSINESS IN U.S.

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE 

 BODY:
Not since a wave of industrial takeovers created the great oil, steel and auto companies at the beginning of the century has corporate America been reshaped by a sweep of merger activity as broad as the one taking place today.
Last year alone, a record $1 trillion in mergers took place involving American companies, a pace almost unrivaled in business history. 
 Practically every industry in America has been affected -- from telecommunications to banking and from aerospace to accounting. The strength of this trend is shown by the fact that the total dollar value of the mergers in 1997 was about 50 percent higher than those in 1996, itself a record year. Companies are combining to create new entities on a scale larger than anything before, reflecting a growing belief among Government regulators, and many business executives, that big business is not necessarily bad.
"This is an astonishing merger wave," said Robert Pitofsky, chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, which regulates mergers. "We haven't seen anything like this in quite some time. More and more deals we see really should be judged on a global market scale, not just on national or local markets. Mergers go through now that would have been challenged just 10 years ago because competition now comes from all corners of the world."
"I do not believe that size alone is a basis to challenge a merger transaction," he added.
Propelling this trend are several factors: An end to the cold war has ushered in a new era of political stability and expanding capitalism, opening new markets in Europe and Asia. As a result, American companies have had to strengthen themselves to exploit new opportunities abroad and to fend off increasingly aggressive overseas competitors. This all comes at a time when a surging stock market and bargain-basement interest rates make financing these transactions easy.
Most of the mergers in the United States have involved domestic corporations. But there have also been an increasing number of deals between American and overseas companies. And a similar wave of mergers is taking place abroad, with European and Asian companies seeking dominant roles in the global economy.
Indeed, when some companies in an industry merge, others come under pressure to do the same to remain competitive.
What is happening at the end of the 20th century is a reprise of the industrial upheavals that took place at the beginning of the century, when more than two dozen auto companies merged in 1908 to create the General Motors Corporation and when the financier J. P. Morgan paid $1.4 billion in 1901 to acquire Carnegie Steel and dozens of others and created the United States Steel Corporation.
The U. S. Steel combination set a record that remained unbroken for more than half a century. Today, billion-dollar deals are far more common. In 1997, there were 156 mergers of $1 billion or more involving American companies -- a number 60 percent higher than the figure from just a year earlier, when 97 mergers exceeded $1 billion, according to the Securities Data Company, a research concern in Newark.
In the last three years, more than 27,600 companies joined hands, completing more mergers than in the entire decade of the 1980's, once considered the high point for mergers.
"The whole private sector of our economy has undergone a truly unbelievable transformation," said Richard L. Huber, chief executive of the Aetna Life and Casualty Company, which became the nation's largest managed health care company through mergers, including the $8.9 billion acquisition of U. S. Healthcare in 1996. "Companies have decided to go for size. They've made a decision to go for big scale or fall back and be a niche player. There is no middle ground."
As a result, many industries are finding themselves with fewer but bigger companies, each one usually taking a bigger market share. For example, mergers have reduced the number of large military contractors to three -- the Boeing Company, the Raytheon Company and the Lockheed Martin Corporation, which itself was created from five companies and is pursuing a sixth.
Federal regulators have seen a doubling in the number of Hart-Scott-Rodino filings -- which are required for all proposed mergers exceeding $15 million -- in the last five years, to 3,700 for the Government's 1997 fiscal year, which ended on Sept. 30.
The economic turmoil in Asia has not yet dampened the trend. Since the Asian problems intensified in October, merger filings with the Government have steadily increased each month, said Connie Robinson, director of merger enforcement at the Justice Department. In fact, in the opening days of 1998, the telecommunications industry continued its hot streak with AT&T's $11.3 billion offer for Teleport Communications Group and SBC Communications' $4.4 billion offer for Southern New England Telecommunications.
The rationale behind today's mergers is different from what motivated the merger barons at the beginning of the 20th century. It is also different from the motivation of the hostile takeover artists who roiled corporate America in the 1980's. And, of course, it could all come to an end if the stock market falls and interest rates climb.
While the 20th century opened with a wave of industrial consolidation aimed at forming domestic monopolies, today's mergers are driven by a desire to gain global reach.
In the 1980's, meanwhile, many takeovers were hostile deals that were heavily financed by debt and were based on breaking up corporations and selling their parts. Today's mergers, however, are usually aimed at building companies and are financed primarily with corporate stock, not borrowed money.
As such, many acquiring corporations have benefited from the surging American stock market, raising the value of the shares that are used as currency in acquisitions.
American corporations now realize that after nearly a decade of reorganizing and downsizing, they cannot wring much more profitability through cost cuts and layoffs, so many are joining forces to remain industrial leaders.
"All the cost-cutting and downsizing that took place in the early 1990's, for which business was so soundly criticized, is finally paying off," said Robert Cotter, co-head of mergers at Salomon Smith Barney. "Now that these companies have rid themselves of excess costs and debt, they've got a lot of capital to invest."
Meanwhile, cold war uncertainties have been replaced around the world with a desire to achieve a rising standard of living -- which opens markets for American products, services and expertise.
"In the 1980's, people talked about globalism but weren't acting globally," said Anthony Magro, head of the merger department at Bear, Stearns & Company. "Now they are. American business used to ask, 'What is wrong with us?' But Europe goes into a slump. Japan goes into a slump. Capitalism wins and the cold war ends. There is American business left standing alone with a rising stock market and the world appearing to be its oyster."
An example of how these factors came together is the $6.9 billion takeover of the Fort Howard Corporation, a paper company, by James River, a former competitor, creating the Fort James Corporation, now the nation's No. 2 consumer paper company. The deal brings together complementary product lines, Fort Howard's superior manufacturing lines and James River's marketing prowess to better take on the bigger Kimberly-Clark and Procter & Gamble.
"This is a merger of coequals who are better off together than apart," said Miles Marsh, Fort James's chief executive. "It pushes us forward in that grand opportunity that lies ahead of us called worldwide growth."
The biggest deal of 1997 was the $36.5 billion takeover bid for MCI Communications by Worldcom Inc., based in Jackson, Miss. That deal, which is subject to approval by the Justice Department, was the latest in more than $100 billion of deals since the telecommunications industry was deregulated in 1996.
In the last five years, there have been 2,492 mergers worth more than $200 billion among commercial banks; 1,435 deals worth $162 billion in radio and television, and 5,114 deals worth $110 billion in the insurance industry, according to Securities Data.
Other areas with heavy merger activity in the last five years are health services, with $107 billion in deals; investment brokers, $104 billion; utilities, $100 billion; oil and gas refining, $96 billion, and hotels and casinos, $84 billion.
So far, little concern has been expressed in Washington. The Government has shifted its antitrust policy from well-known rules that restricted big mergers to a more flexible economic analysis that allows more big companies to unite. Still, not all deals pass muster.
The F.T.C., for instance, halted a proposed $4 billion merger last year between Office Depot Inc. and Staples Inc., the nation's two largest office supply retailers. While the move surprised many, Mr. Pitofsky of the F.T.C. said the deal was rejected because evidence showed that consumers in areas where there was only one office superstore paid higher prices than consumers in areas with competition.
By contrast, the Government cleared Boeing's $15 billion acquisition of the commercial aircraft manufacturer McDonnell Douglas because the Government found that airlines said it made no difference whether the two combined.
Besides, Boeing faces a formidable worldwide competitor in Airbus, the European consortium, and the McDonnell Douglas acquisition reflects a global strategy.
"We have very flexible guidelines," Ms. Robinson of the Justice Department said. "Bigness in and of itself doesn't tell me much. I want to know about the market, the players and what competition exists to judge."
How long this merger pace can continue is anyone's guess. A falling stock market could end it. Should worldwide economic growth slow, the demand for American goods and services could be dampened. And, some companies may simply have so much internal trouble digesting mergers that any hunger for further acquisitions will vanish.
"What could derail this?" asked Steven Heller, head of global mergers at Goldman, Sachs & Company. "An upward movement in interest rates, a downdraft in the stock market, a worldwide credit crunch, an industrial recession. If those things happened, we could see a change. Or it could be something that just comes out of the blue."

HEADLINE: Pataki Seeks Aid For Drivers

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 18

 BODY:
The budget proposal that Gov. George E. Pataki plans to present on Tuesday will contain a few election-year treats for New York State's drivers.
Offering a glimpse of his 1998-99 budget proposal, Mr. Pataki said today that he would call for more money to repair the state's roads and bridges, as well as a significant cut in the fee people pay to register their cars. 
 The Governor said his plan would provide an additional $200 million over the next two years to a $12.7 billion program that the Legislature approved in 1995 to repair roads and bridges across the state by the year 2000.
His proposal would increase the amount of money the state plans to spend on such repair projects to $1.7 billion from $1.6 billion in both 1998 and 1999. He said the plan would create an additional 3,500 jobs in areas like construction and make traveling easier for drivers and passengers on New York roads.
"These additional projects will further improve the safety of New York's roads and bridges while also providing a boost to the economic expansion that is currently taking place in New York," Mr. Pataki said in a statement.
The Governor said his budget would also call for a $13, or 25 percent, cut in the $54 fee that drivers pay every two years to register their cars. That would save New Yorkers $50 million. If approved by the Legislature, the fee reduction would start in July.
"Whether it's through tax cuts or fee reductions, I am committed to putting more money back in the pockets of hard-working New Yorkers," Mr. Pataki said. "The $50 million fee reduction will make owning and driving a car less expensive for millions of middle-class New Yorkers."

HEADLINE: Critics Say Rockefeller Drug Laws Pack the Prisons, Force Plea Deals and Hit Small-Timers the Hardest

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN 

 BODY:
In the 25 years since New York enacted some of the toughest drug laws in the country, drug dealers, prosecutors and defense lawyers have increasingly found ways of working around the laws or using them in a manner never intended, softening the goal of putting away hardened drug traffickers, say many people involved in drug cases.
The laws, pushed through the Legislature in 1973 by Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, have come under periodic attack by critics who say they have clogged the state's prisons without making a dent in the problem of illegal drugs. The echoes of that debate surfaced again last month, when Gov. George E. Pataki commuted the prison sentences of three people serving long mandatory sentences for nonviolent drug crimes. 
 Mr. Pataki granted similar clemencies in the past, and in 1995 he called for changing the Rockefeller drug laws to allow more nonviolent offenders to avoid long jail terms. But such proposals have gone nowhere, in part because politicians are so wary of being labeled as soft on crime.
The Rockefeller laws, which require sentences as high as 15 years to life, have packed the state's prisons with tens of thousands of drug felons and added hundreds of millions of dollars to annual prison expenses. But rather than imprison major drug dealers for long periods, some prosecutors and defense lawyers say, the laws have instead hit more low-level couriers and addicts selling to support their habits, because more of them are arrested.
Over the years, most dealers have learned how to avoid a long stretch in prison by having an addict or even a child carry the drugs for them. As a result, the mandatory minimums have often hit amateurs like Angela Thompson, who was convicted at age 17 of selling two ounces of cocaine to an undercover police officer at the behest of her drug-dealing uncle. She served more than 8 years of a 15-year minimum sentence before being granted clemency by Governor Pataki last month.
But prosecutors have also found that they can wield the laws as a powerful weapon to force low-level or middle-level dealers who are arrested to trade information implicating accomplices or higher-ups, in exchange for lesser sentences.
"There is no question they've made prosecution easier," said Robert H. Silbering, who retired last month after working since 1991 as New York City's special narcotics prosecutor. "If you didn't have the Rockefeller drug laws, you'd probably have a greater number of drug cases going to trial, and you might have gridlock in the courts."
As a result, however, those with no useful information to trade or with little savvy about manipulating the system seem to absorb the full brunt of the law.
"The serf has often ended up with a far worse sentence than the boss, because the serf didn't know anybody to give up," said Charles D. Adler, a Manhattan defense lawyer who has pressed for alternative sentencing. He recalled defending a client caught carrying narcotics for her boyfriend, who was a professional drug dealer. The boyfriend cooperated and got lifetime probation. She got 15 years in prison.
Defense lawyers have sometimes tried to avoid the laws' tough penalties by steering clients into Federal court, whenever a claim can be made for Federal jurisdiction, because the sentences there are relatively less Draconian.
Lloyd Epstein, a lawyer who practices in both Federal and state courts, gave a stark example of the discrepancy between sentences in the two systems. He represented a Venezuelan courier who swallowed some cocaine-filled condoms before flying to New York. The courier became ill after leaving the airport and required emergency surgery to remove the cocaine. After recovering, the smuggler faced a minimum of 15 years in a New York prison, which Mr. Epstein plea-bargained down to 6 years under a less punitive category of the law covering a smaller quantity of drugs.
"If he'd gotten sick inside the airport," Mr. Epstein said, "he could have gotten only 18 months under Federal law."
All 50 states have some form of mandatory sentences. New York's basic Rockefeller drug law compels state judges to mete out a sentence ranging from 15 years to life to anyone convicted of selling two ounces, or possessing four ounces, of an illegal drug like heroin or cocaine. The law sets shorter mandatory sentences for possession or sale of smaller amounts.
In fact, statistics suggest that few defendants receive the maximum sentence because so many plead guilty to a lesser offense. During the first nine months of 1997, only 585 of the 10,062 indictments returned in drug felony cases were for felonies requiring a sentence of 15 years to life.
But that number includes minor figures who insist on going to trial and are then convicted, leaving the judge with no alternative but to impose the mandatory sentence. In one such earlier case, Anthony Papa, a radio repairman, got 15 years to life for carrying four and a half ounces of cocaine. He served more than 11 years in Sing Sing before he was granted clemency by Governor Pataki and released last January.
A second law requires long prison terms for former inmates who served a drug felony sentence and then commit another felony within 10 years. This law has locked up more people than the first law, Mr. Adler said, because a defendant who pleads guilty to a lesser crime in return for a lighter sentence becomes a convicted felon and faces mandatory prison time for the next offense, even if it is unrelated to or less serious than the first.
As of a year ago, almost a third of New York State's nearly 70,000 inmates were locked up for nonviolent drug crimes at an annual cost of more than $600 million. They included 8,760 drug felons incarcerated at an annual cost of more than $260 million under the first law, according to the Correctional Association of New York, an advocacy group trying to improve prison conditions. In addition, 13,075 drug offenders were incarcerated under the second-felony offender law, at an annual cost of more than $390 million. (There is some overlap between the categories.)
Yet some police investigators and street researchers report that hard drugs are more widely available in New York now than they were 25 years ago. One reason is that a new pusher is always ready to take over the sales of an arrested pusher. "What the Rockefeller laws set out to do has simply not been accomplished," said Stephanie Herman, a drug researcher at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice.
State Senator Catherine M. Abate, a Manhattan Democrat, said the Rockefeller law's greatest weakness is that it "does not distinguish between a kingpin and a drug mule." Last January, she joined State Senator Dale M. Volker, a Republican, in sponsoring legislation giving judges discretion to impose a lesser sentence if the offense was confined to a single incident and unconnected to broader drug trafficking. The bill has languished.
Because locking up each inmate costs the state about $30,000 a year, critics say it would be cheaper to put nonviolent addicts into treatment programs. "My constituents don't want drug dealers on the street and neither do I," said Daniel L. Feldman, the chairman of the Corrections Committee in the State Assembly. "But there's nothing dumber than what we're doing now."
Efforts to change the laws have fallen victim to state politics, say some legislators and officials close to Governor Pataki. Because Democrats who control the Assembly are more interested in modifying the law, Republicans who dominate the Senate would like to squeeze Democratic concessions on other legislation. Some upstate Republicans also do not want the laws changed because they have brought new prisons, and new jobs, to their economically depressed constituencies.
But while politicians continue to debate the laws, almost everyone else has learned to live with them. Mr. Epstein, who has represented hundreds of drug defendants, said, "Dealers work around New York's laws by having a low-level employee, often an addict, hold the drugs, so the dealer can walk free."
Marc Mauer, director of the Sentencing Project, a prison reform group based in Washington, said some dealers have children carry the drugs because they are not subject to mandatory minimums.
One addict who is now in a drug treatment program said that when he could no longer afford to buy crack cocaine, he jumped at the chance to get his drugs free. He took on the risky job of holding the stash of crack for a Bronx street dealer, so if the police swooped in, the dealer could avoid a long stretch in prison. "I ended up selling for them," he said. "I held it."
District Attorney Richard A. Brown of Queens has viewed the Rockefeller drug laws from several perspectives.
As a lobbyist for New York City in Albany when the laws were enacted, he warned that they would overwhelm the prisons. Later as a judge, he bridled at restrictions on his ability to impose sentences. Now as Queens District Attorney, he said, the same laws make it easier to combat drug trafficking. Despite his frustration as a judge, he said: "I wonder where we'd be today if we didn't have the Rockefeller drug laws. Perhaps we'd be worse off."
Even so, Mr. Brown said, "I think in the long run we would have been better off if we took the money and used it for prevention, treatment and education."

Gravy Trains Don't Run on Time

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The great lesson of the financial meltdown of Asian autocracies is this: Freedom is indivisible. Economic freedom cannot exist without political freedom.
For decades, Asian dictators claimed that they had perfected a higher form of capitalism. Those in power would determine which entrepreneurs would succeed, and these -- related by blood or bound by kickback to the politicians -- would maintain position by perpetuating the dynasty. 
 The world was assured by such philosophers as Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew that a concern for individual liberty was merely a "decadent Western value," and that Asians had discovered that a one-party state with a strong ruler could better provide the stability for growth.
In that Singapore model, taken up throughout Asia, society's order took precedence over individual freedom. Petty crime was crushed along with political opposition.
Western executives who hated the rigors of competition in a free market were pleased to invest in what seemed to be a sure-thing society. The greasing of government palms -- without the scrutiny of a free press or the restraint of independent judiciaries -- was advertised as a newly stable form of capitalism.
Growth-befuddled bureaucrats at the World Bank joined compilers of economic-freedom indexes to endorse such state-controlled commerce. They justified the secret dealing by peddling the notion that such license to do business among power elites would someday lead to political freedom.
It led to collapse. The waves of panic in Asia today, likely to be followed by despair and class resentment, show how wrong these fake capitalists were. The outstretched hand of local politics is no match for the invisible hand of the global market.
The dictatorial model, driven by mutual back-scratching of elites rather than a profit motive open to all, rewarded despotism and nepotism at the expense of efficiency and transparency. Now eyes are opening all over the world to the realization that the gravy train does not run on time.
Communism, socialism, fascism and "crony capitalism" not only interfere with the free flow of capital to the best producer, but also deny the consumer the right to decide which products succeed. Once again autocrats and their acolytes are learning that government's business in business is to protect competition in business.
Consider Indonesia: The Suharto family, until the recent plunge of the rupiah, was probably richer than Bill Gates. International banks were imprudently lending the President's favored companies as much as desired for patently unproductive uses.
But American politicians and investors cannot tut-tut at Suharto predations without hypocrisy because many were buying into that vaunted "model." One flagrant example is how the Riady family, tightly tied into Suharto's deals, bought influence with candidate Clinton, parlaying that advertisable White House connection into politico-economic deals in Indonesia and China.
Small wonder, then, that before Congress approves the $43 billion bailout of Indonesia through the I.M.F., Suharto will be expected to produce James Riady and Arief "James Riady sent me" Wiriadinata, to testify in the U.S. about the campaign and business activities of the longtime Riady employee John Huang, as well as those of "the two Marks" -- Middleton and Grobmyer -- friends and fund-raisers for the Clintons who showed such an interest in Indonesia.
Infectious dealing among people in power and people with money is not an Asian virus; it is a global virus. The yearning for human freedom that undergirds democratic capitalism and produces stable prosperity is not a Western value, but a universal value.
Taiwan, the Philippines, South Korea, Thailand and even Japan show signs of grasping this; Indonesia's Suharto, fearful of a successor who will track down and recover stolen billions, will sign anything; Vietnam, Malaysia and the powerful Lee family of Singapore still don't get it.
The question about the shakeout in Asia is not whether its resourceful, democratizing nations will recover; they will. The question is whether the political leaders and crony capitalists of Russia and China will get the message, gained at such pain, that there can be no stable prosperity without political freedom.

HEADLINE: Budget Heroes Include Bush and Gorbachev

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 18

 BODY:
Who should get credit for the fact that the Federal budget is now virtually balanced?
Economists and budget experts trying to answer that question have offered some predictable and some unusual suggestions as they celebrate the possible demise of the deficit. 
 Among those entitled to take credit, they said, is President Clinton, as well as President George Bush, who agreed to the first big deficit-reduction package, and Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, who has continually encouraged such efforts.
The experts also gave credit to Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Kremlin leader who presided over the collapse of the Soviet Union. The end of the cold war allowed the United States to cut military spending, and those cuts have been indispensable to progress on balancing the budget.
Plainly, the political parties had a role, though not so grand as they will say in this fall's elections.
Republicans have waged a 17-year campaign to shrink the Government and rein in domestic spending and have tirelessly preached the gospel of fiscal responsibility even as they were voting for tax cuts that increased the deficit. Democrats have historically preferred deficit-reduction bills that emphasized raising taxes but have recently been willing to vote for measures that curbed the growth of spending as well.
While politicians relish the prospect of a balanced budget, few take credit for the specific steps that produced it. Republicans do not brag about the laws that raised taxes in 1990 and 1993. Democrats do not boast about having cut the growth of veterans' benefits, farm subsidies and Medicare payments to doctors and hospitals.
The strong American economy has generated a torrent of new tax revenue and sharply reduced the demand for food stamps and public assistance. But in retracing the steps to a balanced budget, experts also cite factors not found in economics textbooks -- factors like Ross Perot and dumb luck.
James C. Miller 3d, who was President Ronald Reagan's budget director from 1985 to 1988, said "the entrepreneurial spirit of the American people," which has sustained seven years of economic growth, was another important reason for the prospect of a balanced budget.
Martha H. Phillips, executive director of the Concord Coalition, a bipartisan group that lobbies for a balanced budget, said: "The economy gets an A plus. The economy and the taxpayers have to get the bulk of the credit."
In the fiscal year that ended last Sept. 30, the Federal budget deficit was $22 billion, down from the record of $290 billion in 1992, and the Congressional Budget Office said recently that the budget was likely to be "essentially balanced" for the next 10 years if current policies remained unchanged. Individual income tax payments soared 12 percent last year, to $737 billion.
Robert D. Reischauer, who was director of the Congressional Budget Office from 1989 to 1995, said, "The situation we are in right now is a result of a very strong economy, wise fiscal policy adopted in 1990 and 1993, enlightened monetary policy over the last seven years and a substantial dash of good luck."
Rudolph G. Penner, the director of the Congressional Budget Office from 1983 to 1987, said: "Monetary policy has been extraordinarily skillful in recent years. But we've also been extraordinarily lucky. There haven't been any adverse shocks to the economy."
Mr. Perot, who ran as an independent in the 1992 Presidential race and as the candidate of the new Reform Party in 1996, also gets some credit. His televised talks drew attention to the fact that the Federal Government was running big deficits.
Laura D'Andrea Tyson, a former coordinator of economic policy for Mr. Clinton, said Mr. Perot, like the Concord Coalition, had contributed to "a drumbeat to reverse the nation's unsustainable fiscal course." And Leon E. Panetta, Mr. Clinton's first budget director, who later became the White House chief of staff, said Mr. Perot had laid "important groundwork for Clinton's willingness to say the time had come to take on this issue."
After Mr. Clinton became President in 1993 and Congress rejected his request for new spending to stimulate the economy, he worked assiduously for the comprehensive legislation to reduce the deficit that was adopted in 1993. It passed by tiny margins: 218 to 216 in the House and 51 to 50 in the Senate, where Vice President Al Gore broke a tie. No Republican in either chamber voted for the measure, which relied heavily on tax increases that affected people with higher incomes.
Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, who became Speaker two years later, said in 1993 that the bill would lead to "a job-killing recession." Another Republican, Representative Dick Armey of Texas, who is now the House majority leader, described the measure as "a recipe for disaster."
But the President says the bill laid a foundation for the subsequent economic boom.
Ms. Tyson said: "For a decade and a half, Republicans had talked about fiscal responsibility. It took a Democratic President working with a Democratic Congress to translate those words into action."
Democrats and some nonpartisan experts say Mr. Bush and his budget director, Richard G. Darman, deserved more credit than they had received.
Mr. Bush won the White House in 1988 with a promise of "no new taxes," and he lost his bid for re-election in part because he broke that pledge when he accepted new taxes as part of a big deficit-reduction bill in 1990.
In a recent interview, former Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who headed the Ways and Means Committee in 1990, said: "George Bush had as much to do with reaching out to balance the budget as anybody I know. He finally recognized that there would have to be revenue increases."
Calculations by Mr. Reischauer, using data from the Congressional Budget Office, suggest that the 1990 bill was the largest deficit-reduction package to date, about 20 percent bigger than the 1993 measure and more than four times as big as the one approved last year.
Mr. Panetta, who was chairman of the House Budget Committee in 1990, said in an interview last week: "George Bush's willingness to sit down and negotiate that agreement was an important first step in reducing the deficit. He paid a political price, but it was the right thing to do."
A solid majority of Congressional Republicans voted against the 1990 bill, and Mr. Bush later said his support for the tax increase was a major mistake. The savings achieved by that law, signed by Mr. Bush in November 1990, were initially swamped by a recession that began in July 1990 and ended in March 1991.
The 1990 law was important not only because it cut spending and raised taxes, but also because it imposed fiscal discipline on Congress through new budget rules. The rules, though seemingly arcane, have proved effective.
For example, the 1990 law established enforceable limits on certain types of Federal spending, which account for about one-third of the budget. The law also required Congress to pay for any tax cuts or legislative changes that increase the cost of entitlement programs like Social Security. This "pay as you go" requirement has discouraged Congress from creating new entitlements.
Moreover, Mr. Darman persuaded Congress to impose new controls on Government loans and loan-guarantee programs. As a result, lawmakers must confront and acknowledge the potential future costs of such commitments.
In the last few years the Federal Government has also benefited from a reduction in the growth of medical spending. Medicaid, the Federal-state health program for poor people, grew more than 25 percent a year in 1991 and 1992, when states were using creative schemes to tap the Treasury. But the growth of Medicaid was less than 4 percent a year in 1996 and 1997.
The growth of Medicare, the Federal health insurance program for the elderly, has slowed to a lesser degree.
A decline in the number of people receiving and food stamps has also made it easier for Federal officials to balance the budget.
The strong economy has produced jobs for hundreds of thousands of welfare recipients. Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee, said: "Another factor is even more significant. The 1996 welfare law, with its work requirements, sent new signals about what society expects of welfare recipients."
Federal actions to reduce the deficit appear to have strengthened the economy, even as the strong economy has made it easier for Washington to balance the budget.
Ms. Tyson said the President's commitment to reducing the deficit had been "a significant factor in the better-than-expected performance of the economy."
When the Government borrows less money, interest rates tend to be lower, and private industry can borrow more easily. The cycle reinforces itself. Declining Federal deficits have contributed to economic growth, which generated more revenue for the Treasury, which reduced the deficit further.
Such fiscal restraint became easier after the cold war. From its peak in 1989, military spending has declined by one-third, after adjusting for inflation. Russians hold Mr. Gorbachev responsible for economic chaos and other troubles there. But he is, in Mr. Reischauer's view, "an unsung hero" of America's agonizing struggle to balance its budget.

HEADLINE: Hot and Dirty Jobs End; So Does a Way of Life

BYLINE: By RICK BRAGG 

DATELINE: DOLOMITE, Ala., Jan. 17

 BODY:
Looking into the glowing mouth of the coke ovens, a man could almost imagine what hell is like.
Until Thursday, when the ovens cooled for good, Gary Roberts labored 13 years in the 130-degree heat of the Koppers Industries coke plant in this blue-collar enclave of rusty mills and frayed houses near Birmingham. 
 His skin blistered and his mind sometimes melted into black, and at times he wondered whether he would catch fire as he and 300 others turned the raw coal into the volatile noxious fuel used to produce steel.
"I've had my clothes start smoking," said Mr. Roberts, 44. "My son's hard hat melted on his head."
Then, every payday, Mr. Roberts would peek into the pay envelope and glimpse a bit of heaven. He made $14 to $17 an hour till the fire winked out, until the plant shut down in the midst of what many have called a great American economic recovery. All 300 people are out of work.
Now Mr. Roberts, who abused his body every workday for one of the best paychecks in American labor, puzzles over the prosperity that everyone is talking about. He said he heard about it on television, read about it in newspapers, "and I figure they're talking about somebody else."
Dolomite, these days, is an island of despair, a place of uncertainty in a time when Americans talk about spending money with confidence.
Hard industry like steel mills and the industries that support them have been dying here for three decades.
The remaining plants tend to rely more on machines and less on the flesh-and-blood power that poured the steel and burned the coke. Coke plants like Koppers, besieged by the Environmental Protection Agency for abuses and facing uncertain demands for their product, have just closed their doors.
It does not make the men who worked there feel any better to hear that McDonald's is hiring. When people refer to the closing of Koppers as an end of their way of life, it is more than a blue-collar cliche from the bitterness over lost work.
"It's disheartening," said Mr. Roberts, one of a handful of workers staying on for a few weeks to shut the plant, which opened in 1912. "It was good money." And to earn it, he said, "it took a special breed of man."
It is, say people who work in steel and steel-related industries, the hardest, dirtiest work in a hard and dirty field. At Koppers, bosses took job applicants through the plant before interviewing them, so they could see smut-covered workers breathing through respirators to spare them from poison gases that are a byproduct of the process, so they could feel the heat from furnaces burning at 2,100 degrees.
"At least half of them would just keep walking," said Daniel Hundley, who was a carpenter before the lure of steady paychecks brought him into the coke plant. "You ever jump in a black car on a hot summer day," one with all the windows rolled up? Mr. Hundley asked. "It's a lot like that, 24 hours a day."
The good thing about the plant, one of a few left in the Birmingham area, was that a man always felt that he had earned his pay, said Mr. Hundley, 35. In an odd way, the real pain caused by the work made losing the work harder to take. It was as if the fact that they had survived it, day after day, year after year, bound men and their labor closer.
They will talk about it as if they were describing a live thing that always had them by the throat and then, in the next breath, talk about how much they will miss it.
It was common, the workers said, to see a man sag and collapse, and they knew that the man would not be back for at least three days. It took that long, Mr. Hundley said, for a man to get his head cleared, to get to thinking right again. The workers called it "running hot," like a car engine when the radiator overheats.
"You wear thermal underwear, even in the summer, to keep the heat off you," Mr. Hundley said. "It will hurt you. You wear wooden shoes. If you wear rubber, it will absorb the heat and burn the bottoms of your shoes. I've seen people carried off in ambulances. I've run hot before, and seen little pink elephants. I couldn't figure out where I was."
Mr. Roberts, who worked at a United States Steel coke plant before moving to Koppers, always thought about just walking away, but how does a man abandon $17 an hour, especially a man with no college, no real technical training beyond what he learned in the glow of the ovens?
"I would have liked to have changed fields," Mr. Roberts said, "because I was tired of abusing my body. But this is all I know."
His father retired from a coke plant. Three uncles worked in steel plants. But that was a long time ago, when the evening skies seemed to burn orange from the smokestacks of the mills, and the smut hung over Birmingham skies like a black veil. The air smelled strong, like tar. People down here like to say that it smelled like money.
Mr. Hundley grew up in Pleasant Grove, just north of here. He was a boy in the 1960's, when Birmingham was called "the Pittsburgh of the South."
"All the smokestacks were blowing, people were working," he said. "U.S. Steel would dump its slag after the day was done."
The slag, waste product from the smelting, piled up in what seemed like mountains to the boys his age.
In 1970, 26,400 people worked in steel and steel-related industries in the four counties surrounding Birmingham, according to state figures.
Mr. Roberts and his wife, Mary Ann, raised three children, and the paychecks were regular as a courthouse clock. Makers of coke in Birmingham even exported it to Japan.
In 1980, as the economy shrank, foreign competition loomed and demand plunged. The number of people in steel-related jobs fell to 10,500.
"I got laid off, and I thought it was the end of the world," Mr. Roberts said, but he found a job at another plant, at Koppers. "I figured to retire from there."
A college became Birmingham's new economic mainstay. The University of Alabama at Birmingham's medical school became one of the best in the country.
Wolverine-brand work boots gave way to alligator shoes. The skies cleared. Steel never recovered.
By 1990, the industry had 10,700 jobs. In 1996, the industry had 10,300 directly linked to steel. Steel mills here imported coke from Japan, Mr. Roberts said.
"I wonder if it's that same coke we sent them," he said.
Now the skeletons of the mills stick up like old bones.
"It's a great big graveyard, in a way," Mr. Hundley said.
But if the economy is so good, why not retrain for jobs that are increasing? Like workers in hard industry all over the country, Mr. Roberts and Mr. Hundley know that the jobs politicians talk about are either highly technical ones or those in the low-paying service industry.
Mr. Hundley will retrain for a year at a school in Florida to learn how to repair boat engines and hopes that Federal money will pay for it. But the Federal Jobs Training Partnership Act requires him to train in the state where he worked.
As often happens in Alabama, where Federal programs are concerned, there is a breakdown. Although millions of dollars are available for retraining, the state has only two employees to begin the program.
"The ones I feel the sorriest for are the ones who have been there the longest," Mr. Hundley said. "They haven't learned the skills to do anything else. You take a man 50 years old, it's hard for him to jump into a college and do well."
Mr. Roberts would rather find work in an industry that he knows, even if the sweat does rain off him. But even in his own industry, things have changed too much.
"Nowadays you've got to be a pedigreed dog," he said. "They want a paper on you, saying you can do the work, and it doesn't matter whether you really can."

HEADLINE: Metro Matters;
Housing Hope Of Mentally Ill Is Fading Away

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT 

 BODY:
NUBY BATCHELOR is more than willing to talk about his past and its long bleak stretches. But he cannot quite join the pieces together. At one point, he says, he was an Army combat instructor. Sometime later, he became a violent alcholic.
He has spent many years, in his words, "in and out of psych wards," and for a period, or perhaps for several different periods, he slept on a park bench in Harlem. He knows that he is not well. 
 These days, he lives in a tiny, meticulously neat apartment in lower Manhattan, filled with electronic equipment he built from kits. He says he is "very, very lucky."
The apartment is a product of a 1990 agreement between Mario M. Cuomo, then the Governor, and David N. Dinkins, then the Mayor, known as New York/New York. Under the accord to provide supportive housing, the two agreed to work together to confront what anyone who walked the city streets at the time could see was the growing problem of the homeless mentally ill.
Both advocates who worked on the original agreement and officials of the current city administration concur that New York/ New York has been effective. In fact, it is one of the rare programs to be initiated in the Dinkins years that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has embraced.
The problem is that the agreement has now lapsed and there is a real chance that it will not be renewed. It took close cooperation between the state and the city to put New York/New York together in the first place, a kind of cooperation that was always unusual and these days is in particularly short supply. (Some advocates for the mentally ill report that the staffs of Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor Giuliani are on such bad terms that they often ask the advocates to act as intermediaries.)
Though it could still be resurrected, there will be no provision for financing a new agreement in the budget that the Governor is to release tomorrow.
"New York/New York is one of the great unsung policy success stories," said Julie Sandorf, founder of the Corporation for Supportive Housing. "It not only makes good sense societally, but it's also good economics. And now it's over. I don't get it."
UNDER the New York/New York accord, the city and the state agreed to split the cost of building or refurbishing about 3,000 units of supportive housing where the homeless mentally ill could live and receive on-site counseling.
The program has been expensive. No one has calculated the exact cost, but it is safe to say it has run to hundreds of millions of dollars. But consider the alternatives. It costs roughly $20,000 a year to house someone in a city shelter and $113,000 in a psychiatric hospital. By contrast, it costs roughly $12,000 a year to house a mentally ill person in supportive housing.
Advocates for the mentally ill say that in the absence of a second New York/New York agreement, the city can expect a recurrence of the same dismal conditions that led to New York/New York I -- crowded shelters and a rising number of mentally ill homeless living on the streets. Over the next few years, the state plans to cut its psychiatric hospitals' capacity even further, by nearly 2,000 beds. And already, statistics on homelessness in the city suggest some potentially ominous trends.
After declining for several years, the number of homeless single adults in New York City shelters has begun to climb. Perhaps even more seriously, the proportion of shelter residents who are effectively permanent has been increasing, meaning fewer beds for those who need shelter during a temporary stretch of hard luck.
Clearly mindful of the dangers of repeating history -- and being saddled with the cost of caring for patients the state has deinstitutionalized -- city officials have in recent weeks started to press publicly for a new New York/New York agreement.
"New York/New York I has been a resounding success," Gordon Campbell, the city's Commissioner of Homeless Services, said. "We are committed to development of New York/New York II."
State officials have been pointedly noncommittal. Publicly, they say they are trying to determine whether a second agreement would be cost effective. Privately, they accuse city officials of grandstanding.
"They're not saying how much they are willing to spend and they want us to commit to a number," one state official said.
In the meantime, every month the city finds about 200 people who could be moved into New York/New York housing -- were any available.

HEADLINE: Cuba and the Church Continue To Maneuver Over Pope's Visit

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: HAVANA, Jan. 18

 BODY:
With Pope John Paul II scheduled to begin his long-awaited visit to Cuba in just three days, the Cuban Government and the Roman Catholic Church here are locked in behind-the-scenes maneuvering that ultimately will determine to what degree the political impact of the trip is muted or enhanced.
In public, those involved continue to say that the Pope's visit is "purely pastoral" in purpose and that all is proceeding in harmony. 
 And using the newspapers, television and radio stations that Fidel Castro has controlled since 1959, the Cuban President has in recent days sought to portray the Pope as an ally in a struggle against American imperialism.
"We want to see a full house," Mr. Castro said during a five-and-a-half-hour national television appearance that ended early Saturday, adding that he plans to attend a Mass at the Plaza de la Revolucion here on Jan. 25. Cubans should attend "out of courtesy, out of politeness to the visitor," he said, and cautioned, "No one should be shouting 'vivas' at any leader of the revolution."
But at the same time, the Cuban Government has erected obstacles that make it difficult for the church authorities to take their case to Cuba's 11 million people themselves.
Working quietly, the church has been trying to expand the limited space available to it in a one-party state that was officially atheist for 30 years, until 1992. As part of the extensive negotiations that followed the first meeting between John Paul and Mr. Castro, at the Vatican in November 1996, the Cuban church has already secured an increase in visas granted to foreign clergy. It is also pressing for regular access to the state news media and permission to offer religious instruction in schools.
Mr. Castro has sought the papal visit, diplomats and religious leaders here suggested, because he is confident that he can direct its packaging and presentation in a direction that suits his political goals.
They said the Vatican and the Cuban Government have an implicit understanding that the Pope will reiterate the church's longstanding criticisms of the American economic embargo of Cuba and what one senior Cuban official called "the vulgar materialism" of the West.
Referring to the newspaper of Cuba's Communist Party, Mr. Castro said in his televised remarks over the weekend that some of John Paul's speeches read as if they were written by "a journalist from Granma, although of course I am not going to accuse the Pope of being a Communist." The Pope, he added is "a big headache for the unipolar hegemonism of the United States" and "of imperialism, because he is not a man who can be manipulated."
For that reason, it is not correct to classify the Polish-born Pope as the "angel of death for socialism, Communism and revolution," Mr. Castro continued, adding, "He was not the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union."
Mr. Castro also said, "Instead of a meeting between an angel and the devil, wouldn't it be better to think of a meeting between two angels who are friends of the poor?"
Taking their cue from their leader, other Cuban officials have also spoken with admiration of the Pope and the church's social mission. Ricardo Alarcon, for instance, a former Foreign Minister who is now Speaker of Parliament, has referred to the Pope by such titles as "His Holiness" or "The Holy Father" and dismissed the religious persecutions of the past as a mere "misunderstanding."
At the level of individual churches, though, the situation is far more complicated. Churchgoers, whose numbers have risen rapidly during the "special period" of economic austerity that began with the collapse of the Soviet Union, still complain of official repression of the sort that occurred in the Havana neighborhood of Miramar on Saturday.
Youngsters enrolled in catechism groups at Santa Rita de Casia Church were happily pasting small posters proclaiming the arrival of "the messenger of love and hope" onto trees and poles there.
A police officer on a motorcycle, wearing an imposing helmet and sunglasses, approached them and ordered them to stop. "You know, there's a directive of the party forbidding this," he said sternly.
The adult supervising the children asked, "How can that be if the President himself said on television last night that it's all right, and he is the secretary general of the party?"
"Well, I don't know anything about that," the police officer replied. "All I know is that I've told various other groups to stop, and nobody else has given me any back talk. So it's best that you stop now, because if you don't, people are just going to get upset and tear those posters down."
With that, the children returned to their church as an adult stayed behind. A few minutes later, a man in civilian clothes arrived and told the policeman to let the postering resume. But when a separate group headed out from the church in another direction, it too was rebuffed, this time by a different policeman.
Earlier this month, the Madrid newspaper El Pais reported that church officials had found a bugging device in a house where the Pope is scheduled to stay during his five day-visit, which begins on Wednesday. Cuban officials have denied the report, and Vatican and Cuban church officials declined comment.
As evidence of some easing of restrictions, on the other hand, Jaime Cardinal Ortega last week delivered a half-hour address on state television about the visit, marking the first time since Mr. Castro came to power that a Cuban Cardinal has been permitted to speak to the nation through the mass media. Later, officials said broadcasts of the Pope's Masses here, the subject of more than a year of negotiations, would take place.
In his address, Cardinal Ortega described the Pope not as an anti-Communist first and foremost but as a nationalist whose patriotic pride was wounded by the Soviet occupation of Poland after World War II. Mr. Castro picked up on that theme in his remarks this weekend, drawing an implicit parallel to his own resistance to the dominance of the United States here before 1959.
But despite Mr. Castro's conciliatory words, church officials say that what they really want is regular access to the state media. In its absence, parishes have organized missions that have quietly gone door to door to explain the Pope's role in the church and his background.
The deacon of a small parish church in Regla, a working-class suburb, said that "after all these years, a lot of people know nothing at all" about Catholic teachings. "We have had to explain everything from the beginning, starting with what is the function of a Pope," he added.
Ultimately, diplomats here said, both the Pope and Cardinal Ortega aspire to a much more visible and prominent role for the church here. The precise dimensions of that role have not been made clear, but the church's desire to use the Pope's visit as a springboard are obvious.
In a recent pastoral letter, the Cuban Conference of Bishops declared, "The action of the church in society is not limited to the free exercise of worship." Cardinal Ortega told the Cuban church publication Verdad y Esperanza that the main challenge facing the church after the Pope's departure would be "a dialogue with the state that has yet to start seriously, and which did not advance during the year of preparation for the papal visit."
A Latin American diplomat here put it this way: "The state reserves all power to itself, so there is an institutional vacuum at a time when Cuban society has begun to worry who might guide or broker a transition after Fidel Castro. The church is the sole entity with both the independence and the credibility to allow it to possibly play such a role."
For the moment though, the average Cuban can only watch and wait as church and state jockey. As a group of residents of downtown Havana waited in line today outside a butcher shop across the street from a church, they were asked if they expected the Pope's visit to result in immediate, concrete changes.
"That would be a miracle," one woman said with a laugh. "And as Cubans, though we have learned to hope for miracles, we cannot bring ourselves to believe in miracles."

HEADLINE: 'Year of Woman' Senators In Tough Re-election Races

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Jan. 18

 BODY:
The opulent banquet room in the Chicago Hilton and Towers was brimming with Democrats, their $500 gate fees entitling them to an open bar, a roster of spunky speeches and the chance to fatten the re-election campaign coffers of Senator Carol Moseley-Braun.
Sharing the stage with Vice President Al Gore and Senator Richard J. Durbin, among others, Senator Moseley-Braun addressed the crowd. 
 "There's just no question in my mind but that I could not do this without you," she told them, smiling gratefully. "I couldn't continue to put up with the battles and the fights and the troubles and the trials and the raising the money and all the rest of it that I know everybody in this room knows about."
The "troubles and the trials" were taken by many at the fund-raising reception last Tuesday to be an oblique reference to a string of episodes that have stung the Senator in her time in office, raising questions about her judgment on issues including campaign finances, her choice of staff and a secretive trip to Nigeria to meet that country's dictator.
As Ms. Moseley-Braun wages her battle for re-election this year, things are quite different from the way they were in her blockbuster senatorial campaign in 1992. Then, Ms. Moseley-Braun sprang from the obscurity of the Recorder of Deeds office in Cook County, marshaled the anger of female voters in both parties over the male monopoly in Congress, unseated a veteran Democrat and cruised to victory over a Republican rival to become the first African-American woman elected to the United States Senate.
Her stunning success, along with that of other female candidates, gave 1992 the label Year of the Woman. Now, many view Ms. Moseley-Braun as one of the most vulnerable senators, unlikely to maintain the support of the white suburban women who helped elect her last time. And analysts say she will have to work to shore up her base of support by showing her effectiveness as a senator. The challenge for her, experts say, is to dispel the negative images of her first years.
But she is not the only woman facing a re-election fight. Two other Senators elected in 1992, Barbara Boxer of California and Patty Murray of Washington, are also believed to be in for a battle, a surprising turn in a year when a strong economy and relative social and political calm are expected to make re-election easy for most incumbents.
"All three of them are considered vulnerable," said Susan J. Carroll, research associate for the Center for the American Woman and Politics at Rutgers University. "Carol Moseley-Braun has got all these ethical questions. Murray has got performance questions. Boxer, they will paint her as a liberal, that's probably the rap against her. And they all come from states that can go either way."
In addition, two of the three Democrats are being challenged by Republican women.
Ms. Murray's only opponent so far is Linda Smith, a United States Representative known for aggressive campaigning and conservative views. In Illinois, two Republicans are vying for Ms. Moseley-Braun's seat: State Senator Peter Fitzgerald, a millionaire conservative, and Loleta Didrickson, the State Comptroller, who has the backing of Republican leaders like Bob Dole and Jim Edgar, the popular Governor.
The shape of these races, political experts say, tells a lot about the status of women in politics these days, a picture that is much more complicated than it was six years ago, when women flowed into elected office in record numbers, picking up 19 House seats and 4 Senate seats.
 
Post-Anita Hill, And on Their Own
Several things have changed.
"Women voters are no longer surprised to see names like their own on the ballot," said Anita Perez Ferguson, president of the National Women's Political Caucus, a group that recruits women to run for office.
"There is one clear negative difference," said Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster. "In 1992, gender was an issue and it clearly worked to women's advantage. They represented change, they represented the people that the Senate Judiciary Committee talked down to" when Anita Hill testified at the Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Clarence Thomas in 1991. "Those kind of macro-forces don't exist this year," Ms. Lake said.
Women running for re-election are perceived more as incumbents than as women, experts say, with the advantages of fund-raising connections and the potential disadvantages of records that can be criticized.
At the same time, the pool of seasoned female politicians has deepened in recent years as more women are encouraged to try to make the jump from state legislatures to national office. The matchups are smarter, the candidates are tougher, the contests more sophisticated.
"A lot of these women come from elected positions or appointed positions in the state," Ms. Ferguson said. "That is the farm team. They know the ropes. They know what's expected. They know how to run a campaign."
More women are running against women, especially since Republicans are making an effort to recruit candidates in hopes of closing the gender gap that exists between the G.O.P. and the Democrats. In Michigan, Republican women are running for 3 of the 10 seats held by Democrats, and one of the women, Susan Grimes Munsell, a former state representative, hopes to unseat a female incumbent, Debbie Stabenow.
The effect of all this has been a complicated splatter pattern of female candidates. Since 1992, there have been only modest increases in the number of women winning primaries or national office. Women make up only 11 percent of the 535 members of Congress -- 50 in the House and 9 in the Senate -- and 22 percent of state legislators. The only office where they come close to parity is lieutenant governor, where 18 of the 42 states with that position have voted women in, often as demographic or ideological counterweights.
Yet, the maturation of female candidates has led some women with high-profile track records to take on or at least consider major challenges: Geraldine A. Ferraro hopes to unseat Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato in New York, and Senator Dianne Feinstein is considering a race for governor in California.
 
More Hoping To Be Governors
In a significant change this year, a record number of women, possibly 16, are expected to declare their candidacy for governor, historically a harder office for women to win than a seat in either house of Congress.
"Voters draw the line between executive characteristics and legislative characteristics, and typically the electorate through the 80's did not see women as the executive," Ms. Ferguson said. "Now, the woman boss in your office is becoming much more common."
In Hawaii, Linda Crockett Lingle, the Mayor of Maui, is considered a strong contender for the Republican nomination for Governor. In Connecticut, Representative Barbara B. Kennelly, a Democrat, is trying to defeat Gov. John G. Rowland. And in Iowa, a state with no women in national elected office, Lieut. Gov. Joy Corning, a moderate Republican, is running for Governor.
"The question comes up every day: can a woman win?" said Ms. Corning's campaign manager, Will Lynch. "That was one of the contributing factors in Joy's decision to run. If women in her position aren't out there bumping up against the glass ceiling, when are we going to knock it down?"
Female officeholders still have the benefit of being perceived as less partisan and more conciliatory, but they suffer from being seen as softer on economic issues and crime. And some women running for office, particularly Republicans, said they continue to face more basic hurdles, even if a woman has held the seat.
Marylin Shannon, a Republican State Senator in Oregon running for Congress against Darlene Hooley, a Democrat, said she did not believe all her state's voters had come to accept women in high office. She said a woman once walked up to her and several campaign volunteers at a McDonald's and announced that she would never vote for a woman. Ms. Shannon said she is frequently introduced as a state representative instead of as a senator. "Then they'll apologize profusely," she said. "But they think the Senate is for men."
In the United States Senate, Democrats acknowledge that the women who were swept into office in 1992 are among the most embattled senators up for re-election.
"I don't know if it has anything to do with them being women," said Michael Tucker, a spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. "I wondered about that myself. I can tell you this much: I'm glad and we're certainly fortunate from a party standpoint that it is our women who are in the toughest fights. These women are driven. Nobody will outwork them."
Senator Murray's biggest challenge, analysts say, is conveying to voters what she has achieved in office. Mr. Tucker cited Ms. Murray's advocacy of environmental issues and pension protection as positive examples of her effectiveness. In addition, Mr. Tucker said that Democrats believed Ms. Murray's 1992 nickname, the "mom in tennis shoes," was still an image voters responded to well, and many Democrats hope that the staunch conservatism of Ms. Murray's opponent, Representative Smith, will make her unappealing to moderate voters.
In California, Senator Boxer may have been given a small lift when Mayor Susan Golding of San Diego, a moderate Republican, dropped out of the race this month. A recent state poll showed Ms. Boxer far ahead of her Republican opponents but falling short of winning support from 50 percent of the voters.
 
Incumbent Has Work Cut Out for Her
In Senator Moseley-Braun's case, a poll last summer showed that only a third of the voters wanted her re-elected. But supporters are banking on voters forgetting the missteps of her first term and focusing on her work on issues like schools and urban environmental problems.
With the help of party leaders, Ms. Moseley-Braun managed to ward off a primary challenge. Her campaign is finally in the black after five years of paying off debts. The Senator has also been paying legal bills estimated at more than $100,000 for a Federal Election Commission investigation into hotel and travel expenses charged to a campaign debit card used by her and the man who was her campaign manager and fiance, Kgosie Matthews. The commission dropped the investigation last year, saying the reputed violations were not as serious as those in other cases before the commission, that staff time was scarce and that the statute of limitations may have run out.
Ms. Moseley-Braun said her strategy this time will have little to do with the fact that she is a woman.
"It's not about me, it's about the job that I've done," she said in an interview. "Those questions are gender-neutral. I'm just going to put my credentials before the people and suggest to them that it's a good idea to rehire me for this job."
Some analysts say Ms. Moseley-Braun, Illinois's senior Senator, has her work cut out for her.
"She has to not only repair the damage that was done with voters in terms of restoring confidence," said John Pelissero, a political science professor at Loyola University here. "She has to also point to a record of real accomplishment. In many voters' minds, the accomplishments of Carol Moseley-Braun are a little fuzzy."

Female Incumbents Vulnerable This Year
The stunning success of Senator Carol Moseley-Braun of Illinois, along with that of other female candidates, gave 1992 the label "Year of the Woman." Now, many view Ms. Moseley-Braun as one of the most vulnerable senators, and she is not the only woman facing a tough re-election fight. Two other Senators elected in 1992, Barbara Boxer of California and Patty Murray of Washington, are also believed to be in for a battle in a year when re-election is expected to be easy for most incumbents.

HEADLINE: COLLEGE BASKETBALL: At Princeton, A Sense Of Where They Are;
The Tigers Thrive In a Special System

BYLINE: By JACK CURRY 

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN

 BODY:
The players on perhaps the most precise and definitely the most unusual college basketball team in the nation are sitting at school desks inside a musty room waiting to oppose Yale on a January night. A curtain surrounds the Princeton Tigers to supposedly muffle the sounds of students on rowing machines as Coach Bill Carmody lectures his squad.
But Carmody is not distracted in this strange setting. His voice is passionate and his eyes are excitable as he hovers over the players. 
 Carmody knows he has a wonderful group of athletes, maybe as special as any since Bill Bradley was the big man on campus more than three decades ago, and he knows his players should squash Yale.
So Carmody peers into their anxious faces and reminds them of who they are, and who they can become.
"Each time you go out there, you want to show this is the product of your hard work," Carmody tells them. "It's such a special time for you. There are 35-year-old guys who play basketball every weekend and wish they could be where you are."
He continues: "Enjoy it, but whatever you do is what people are going to remember you by. When you're 25, you don't want to think back that we didn't play well against Yale. Why not remember playing 15 straight games where we were great?
"This is a special time," he tells his players. "Don't let it go by."
Over the next 40 minutes, Princeton did not. While the Tigers (13-1) were not as dominant as they have often been in losing only to then No. 1 North Carolina and achieving a No. 12 ranking, they never trailed while winning, 69-58.
On this night, they won by scoring all but a few of their points on layups, 3-pointers or free throws. They won by being patient and unselfish in a system Princeton has singularly employed since its former coach Pete Carril walked onto campus in 1967. They won by using a quick and underrated defense. And they won in an athletic manner that makes these Tigers quite special.
"I don't buy into that Ivy League, nonscholarship stuff," said Niagara Coach Jack Armstrong, whose team lost to Princeton, 61-52, in the ECAC Holiday Festival final.
"That's ridiculous," Armstrong said. "These guys can play."
 
The System Is Simpler Than It Appears to Be
As Carmody fiddles with the remote control while reviewing the Yale game in his office, he keeps insisting that Princeton's system of choreographed zigs and zags is simple.
Carmody has a summer basketball camp and said that teen-agers are fearful of trying the offense, but they grin as if Michael Jordan were their new roommate after they understand and run it after three days of practices.
The Tigers start three seniors and two juniors; they are savvy and skilled, and that is apparent as they unleash their offensive sets.
All five players are moving. Cutting hard. Setting screens. Searching for the trusty backdoor play. Holding the ball high and making crisp passes. Staying properly spaced, with center Steve Goodrich above the key to direct the flow and keep the middle open. They want layups or 3-point attempts and patiently move from option to option until the search is successful.
Usually, they get their threes.
After Goodrich faked a backdoor pass and gave up the ball on the second possession against Yale, he used a screen set by James Mastaglio at the free-throw line to nail the first of Princeton's 11 3-pointers. The basket came off the 12th pass of the possession and destroyed 34 seconds of seemingly sound man-to-man defense by Yale.
Usually, they get their layups. Midway through the first half, Mitch Henderson passed to Goodrich above the key. Goodrich faked handing the ball back to Henderson, a signal for a play, and Henderson veered right to screen Emerson Whitley, Gabe Lewullis's defender. Whitley anticipated it and shifted right to prevent a 3-pointer because Lewullis makes 44 percent from that range.
That opened the backdoor. Lewullis darted to his right and snared Goodrich's pass a stride from the basket for the prettiest of Princeton's 14 layups.
The backdoor is Princeton's signature, the play that Goodrich and Lewullis combined on to shock U.C.L.A., the defending champions, in the first round of the 1996 National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament.
However, they do not even practice it. It is simply within the system.
"I hate when people tell me this is hard to do," Carmody said. "You can do this at any level and any school."
 
The Team Is Smart And Hard-Nosed
Goodrich, a 6-foot-10-inch senior, is the most critical player in Princeton's system because he is a point center who comes out high in the offense and leaves the pivot open for cutting.
He barely shot 3-pointers in high school, but has made 42 percent from beyond the arc. Yale Coach Dick Kuchen has praised him as one of the two top passing centers in the country. Since Princeton does not have a true inside attack and essentially starts Goodrich and four interchangeable guards, his versatility around the perimeter is integral.
"It's five guys working together," Carmody said, "but the center is the most important."
If Goodrich is not nabbing another assist, then it is Henderson, the feisty guard who is such an impressive athlete he was drafted by the Yankees as an outfielder. The 6-1 Henderson has an assist-to-turnover ratio of 2 to 1, a superb statistic because his left-handed bounce passes off the dribble, which could squeeze through closing subway doors, often glide between two befuddled defenders.
"He's the toughest guy on the team in every way," Carmody said.
Brian Earl looks like he might shave once a month, but he can be an assassin. He also leads the team in scoring, averaging 14.2 points a game.
When Yale twice trimmed the deficit to 7 points in the second half, Earl played Superman. The guard faked a 3-pointer and drove around two defenders for a layup. Then he sank a 3-pointer after Goodrich feigned a backdoor pass to Nate Walton.
Earl's effort was particularly inspiring because the economics major had slept just one hour the previous night while finishing a paper for the course "Mechanical Aerospace Engineering."
"It's not as hard as it sounds," said Earl, whose older brother, Dan, is the starting point guard at Penn State. "Really, it isn't."
With his crew cut and rugged approach, Lewullis looks as if he belongs at a military academy. Actually, he fits snugly at Princeton, where he is the elite 3-point shooter and showed it by making four against Yale. Mastaglio is an adept passer and capable defender who takes the fewest shots among the starters.
"We have smart players who are very good athletes," said Carmody, the second-year head coach who started as an assistant in 1982. "We used to hang around the Wake Forests and North Carolinas for 33, 34 minutes. Now we can win those games."
 
They're Just as Precise On the Defensive End
Everyone adores Princeton's unusual offense, but they play such persistent man to man and box out so strongly for rebounds that Armstrong has shown his Niagara players videotapes of the Tigers on defense as instructional tools. Princeton, the kings at securing wide-open jumpers, rarely allows opponents to get clean looks, which is why the Tigers limit them to 42 percent from the field and under 50 points a game.
After Princeton used a fullcourt press at the start of the game, the Bulldogs turned the ball over five times on their next six possessions against the man to man and never really recovered. When the Bulldogs chiseled the deficit to 56-49 with seven minutes left, the Tigers shut them out for five minutes.
"They're doing what they're supposed to be doing," Kuchen said. It was a simple statement that said a lot.
 
As They Dream of a Title, Others Try to Stop Them
Can Princeton be stopped? According to other coaches, it can be done.
Throttle the shooters. Obviously, it is not easy. Earl, Goodrich and Lewullis are the top gunners, so try to force shots from Henderson, who has made 19 percent from 3-point range, or Mastaglio, who has made 32 percent. Niagara tried that, but Mastaglio had a season-high 18 points and Henderson still sank three 3-pointers. He has made three more in 13 other games.
Get them into foul trouble. The starters average between 32 and 36 minutes a game and, on average, score 50.9 of Princeton's 62.1 points. Henderson missed 17 minutes against Yale with foul trouble, and the Tigers survived. They might not be so fortunate against a superior team. Regardless, Carmody is not concerned about depth.
"I'm not putting someone in there thinking that if I give him minutes, he'll be better later in the year," Carmody said. "We have hard practices. I'll see it in practice."
Switch defenses. The worst thing to do against the Tigers is to let them get too comfortable in their system, so it is essential to vary the defenses and at least make them prove how smart they are. Yale began with a man to man, switched to a 1-3-1, a 1-2-2 and a matchup zone and used fullcourt pressure, without one approach having continuous success.
"I love it when teams go to zones," said Carmody, talking like a coach who knows that his zone offense provides four scoring options. "We kill zones."
Carmody was a coach without a team as he sat in his office last week. Princeton, which does not give athletic scholarships, is in the middle of a 15-day hiatus from games and formal practices because of exams.
"All I do is put out basketballs for guys who want to shoot for an hour as a study break," he said.
The lack of activity should have given Carmody more time to dream. How far can the Tigers advance this season? Carmody claimed he does not think about the possibility of a national championship. It might sound strange to envision the Tigers using their array of cuts, screens and backdoors, their endless barrage of 3-pointers and even their athleticism to challenge for a title, but it should not. Not in this special season.
"I would like to go as far as we can," Carmody said. "If we're fortunate enough to get a bid to the N.C.A.A.'s, I want us to go as far as we can. We're trying to do that."

Strong Job Gains Made In December and in 1997

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
More than 13,400 new jobs were created in New Jersey last month, making 1997 the best year for new employment since 1988, according to a report released on Friday by state officials.
Over all, 78,100 new jobs were created last year, bringing the total number of jobs in New Jersey to 3.75 million, a record high, said the report by the State Department of Labor. 
 The report also found that New Jersey's unemployment rate in December was below 5 percent for the second month in a row. Before November, the unemployment rate had not dipped below 5 percent since June 1990, according to the report.

HEADLINE: Studies of Schizophrenia Vindicate Psychotherapy

BYLINE: By DENISE GRADY 

 BODY:
WHEN a man with schizophrenia requested psychotherapy recently in addition to his antipsychotic medication, he was told that his health maintenance organization would allow only six sessions. "The insurer said there was no evidence that psychotherapy helps people with schizophrenia," said Gerard Hogarty, a researcher and professor of psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.
The story is all too familiar to therapists. The notion behind it is that people with schizophrenia are either too sick to be reached by psychotherapy or, thanks to medication, too well to need it. 
 But Professor Hogarty and his research team have shown that schizophrenic patients taking medication can be helped further by a certain type of psychotherapy. In two studies published in November in The American Journal of Psychiatry, the group showed that a three-year course of the treatment, which they developed and named personal therapy, was extremely helpful to many patients in preventing relapses and improving social adjustment.
Dr. Wayne Fenton, medical director of Chestnut Lodge Hospital in Rockville, Md., who was an author of an editorial accompanying the results of the studies, said they provided the first scientific proof that psychotherapy can help people with schizophrenia. "Because of this, people can no longer argue that psychotherapy for schizophrenia is not effective," Dr. Fenton said. "One might say there is no excuse anymore not to provide needed care."
Although antipsychotic drugs are unmatched in their power to halt the hallucinations and delusions that characterize schizophrenia, they do not erase all signs of illness.
"People are better, but not well," Professor Hogarty said. Despite medication, many patients still have difficulties with memory, attention, problem solving and relating to other people. Relapses are common, often because patients quit taking their medication, but sometimes even when they stick with it. Only 10 percent to 30 percent of the two million Americans with schizophrenia are employed. "There's no drug out there to teach you how to get along with anybody, or how to get a job and keep one," Professor Hogarty said.
Dr. George T. Niederehe, head of the adult and geriatric psychosocial treatment research program at the National Institute of Mental Health, said, "Many of the people we talk about as the homeless are persons with these kinds of mental health problems."
Dr. Niederehe and other experts praised the study. "It's a major advance," said Dr. William T. Carpenter Jr., director of the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center in Baltimore. Dr. Carpenter, who was not associated with the study, said that personal therapy appeared to be the most beneficial treatment developed since the first antipsychotic drugs were introduced in the 1950's.
The treatment of schizophrenia has had a contentious history. When it became clear during the 1960's that antipsychotic drugs worked far better than psychotherapy for most patients, doctors began to question whether psychotherapy was of any use for people with schizophrenia. There are about 400 different types of psychotherapy, Professor Hogarty said, and studies in the last 30 years have been contradictory, with some finding psychotherapy helpful in treating schizophrenia and others calling it useless or even harmful.
By the mid-1980's, psychotherapy had such a bad reputation among experts in schizophrenia that a proposal to study anything by that name would have been "an invitation to unemployment," Professor Hogarty said. The climate inspired him and his colleagues to call the techniques they developed something else: personal therapy.
Their treatment differs radically from the Freudian psychoanalysis that many people think of as psychotherapy. "We're not looking into suppressed thoughts about Mama," Professor Hogarty said. "It's more in the here and now."
Personal therapy is based on the idea that people with schizophrenia are born with brain abnormalities that make them especially vulnerable to emotional stress. Overwhelming stress, often from dealings with other people, can lead to anxiety and depression, which may in turn spiral down into psychosis.
In personal therapy, the therapist tries initially to help patients recognize stress and manage it in order to avoid relapses of schizophrenia. The treatment program is tailored to each patient's needs, and patients progress at their own pace. Eventually, they may reach a stage where they are ready for counseling to help them get along better with other people and to minimize stressful encounters.
Professor Hogarty's study included 151 patients, 97 living with their families and 54 living independently. Most were in their 20's or 30's, and all took antipsychotic medication. Each was assigned to a group that received personal therapy two to four times a month for three years, or, for comparison, family therapy, personal and family therapy, or supportive therapy in which patients were given the opportunity to talk with a therapist and seek help during crises.
In the patients who lived with relatives, only a quarter who received personal therapy alone had relapses, as opposed to half of those who had the other kinds of therapy. Only two quit personal therapy, but 13 dropped out of the other programs.
But in patients living on their own, more receiving personal therapy had relapses than those getting supportive treatment: about half relapsed, as opposed to slightly more than a third of the others. Four left personal therapy, and five left supportive therapy. The researchers said they suspected that personal therapy failed in that group because many of the patients were struggling to find housing, food and clothing, and the treatment may have been too demanding for them.
But in another area, social adjustment, both groups of patients benefited from personal therapy. Personal relationships and work performance improved. Most important, they continued to get better over time, while benefits from the other types of therapy tended to reach a plateau after a year. Had the study gone on, Professor Hogarty said, the patients in personal therapy might have continued to improve even further.
He and his team have devised another treatment that they are now testing, called cognitive enhancement therapy. It involves computer programs aimed at helping patients improve problem-solving skills, and group sessions designed to heighten the ability to act wisely in social situations. Patients like it, and Professor Hogarty thinks the treatment may ultimately prove even more helpful than personal therapy.
Despite the value of personal therapy, other researchers and Professor Hogarty himself said they doubted it would come into widespread use. It is expensive and time-consuming, and would require extensive retraining of therapists.
Nonetheless, Professor Hogarty said, in the long run personal therapy might prove cost effective, because by preventing relapses it can keep patients out of the hospital, which is the most expensive form of care. The treatment may also get them back in the work force. "You get what you pay for," he said. "If you want to pay something more, the lives of these patients can improve substantially."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Asian Financial Crisis Begins to Affect European Economy

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Jan. 19

 BODY:
Asia's financial crisis is starting to affect Europe, slowing down exports of everything from heavy machinery to telephones and worsening what were already gloomy prospects for reducing joblessness this year.
Though the ultimate magnitude of Asia's impact remains a guessing game, the trouble signs have been proliferating and analysts are hastily trimming back predictions of economic growth that they made as recently as Christmas. 
 The problems come at a bad time. Booming exports have been the only bright spot in Germany and France, Europe's two biggest economies, and government leaders there have been counting on exports to fuel the first solid economic growth in years.
A slowdown of economic growth is also likely to add to unemployment, which is more than twice as high as in the United States and running at record levels in Germany and France. Joblessness is the biggest political problem for both Lionel Jospin, the Socialist Prime Minister of France, who was forced to use riot police last week to subdue protests by unemployed workers, and Helmut Kohl, the Chancellor of the right-of-center German Government.
To the surprise of most economists, the ranks of Germany's unemployed jumped by 200,000 people last month, to 4.5 million, or 11.8 percent.
Economists said European companies were being hit in at least two ways. The first was through reduced exports to Asian countries, because the devaluation of their currencies had abruptly eliminated much of their buying power, and the slowdown had already led several Asian countries to put off planned development projects. Still, Southeast Asia accounts for less than 5 percent of European exports.
The second and potentially more serious impact is in the form of price pressure. Because Asian currencies have been devalued so sharply, products from countries like South Korea are far more competitive in world markets. That makes it difficult for European or American companies to raise prices, at home or abroad, and is likely to dampen the appetite for investment and spending.
The impact has already shown up at some companies.
A.B.B. Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish engineering conglomerate, said last week that about $560 million in export orders from Southeast Asia had been delayed and could be canceled.
Deutsche Telekom A.G., Germany's dominant telephone company, added $412 million to its provisions on Friday to cover possible losses on investments in Southeast Asia. Deutsche Telekom owns stakes in telecommunication companies in Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines.
Airbus Industrie, the Paris-based aircraft consortium, was trying to collect money from the Indonesian airline Garuda for three airplanes it had ordered. Airbus officials said that Garuda had paid for and received six of nine aircraft that it ordered several years ago. But in December, Garuda failed to come up with $8 million in payments on the three planes that remain to be delivered.
Meanwhile, Moody's Investor Service lowered its credit rating on Friday for two big French banks and issued warnings on seven other European banks. All of these banks have big portfolios of Asian loans, though several say that their potential losses are small if not negligible and that the warnings are unnecessary.
Beyond anecdotal evidence, economists say there are statistical signs that the effects of the Asian crisis are spreading. Salomon Smith Barney has trimmed its growth estimate for the 11 European countries that are expected to take part in the single currency next year, from about 3 percent to 2.6 percent.
Analysts said Germany could feel the biggest impact, because it has always been a big exporter of heavy machinery and capital equipment -- precisely the kind used in big government-sponsored development projects that Asian countries are now delaying or canceling.
The first hint of trouble came earlier this month, when the German Government reported that the volume of foreign orders for German goods had declined substantially for the second consecutive month. After soaring more than 20 percent through last August, as a surge in the American dollar made German products far cheaper in many markets, foreign orders declined by 3.7 percent in October and 2.9 percent in November.
UBS Securities, in a report headlined "Asia Bites," revised its economic forecast for Germany, predicting that exports and profitability in general will be hurt by the Asian crisis. "Undoubtedly, Germany's share in global exports will suffer," said Ralf Kugelstadt, a UBS economist in Frankfurt.
The Asian troubles are not expected to derail the plan for a single European currency, the euro, which is to be introduced on Jan. 1, 1999. Under the Maastricht Treaty, countries are to be admitted largely on the basis of whether they met certain fiscal standards during 1997. Based on what is known about results during 1997, most economists and government officials now assume that 11 countries will join the euro club next year.
But the crisis in Asia could add to problems, like unemployment, that were already made worse by the preparation for the adoption of the euro. European countries have endured painful cuts in government spending and increases in taxes to meet the strict requirements for participating in the euro, and slower economic growth could easily turn the euro into a highly unpopular political issue.

HEADLINE: U.N. Envoy, In Baghdad, Hints Teams Could Alter

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Jan. 19

 BODY:
The United Nations chief arms inspector for Iraq, Richard Butler, said here today that he might at some point be willing to take a second look at the composition of inspection teams, some of which the Iraqis have complained have too many Americans.
"We choose the best that we can," he said, adding that experts were recruited from around the world to form teams tailored to certain sites and problems. "Maybe in the future, we'll make a double take and look at their nationalities. But only after we look at their qualifications." 
 Before talks that began today, Mr. Butler acknowledged that relations with Saddam Hussein were again at a crisis point but offered Iraq a few crumbs of hope for quicker action toward lifting sanctions.
President Hussein threatened on Saturday to throw all United Nations inspectors out of the country within six months if the sanctions against Iraq's oil sales were not lifted.
As Mr. Butler was arriving today, Iraqis staged a funeral for 70 children said by the Government to have died because the embargo deprived them of food and medicine.
Nevertheless, Mr. Butler said Iraq's threat to end cooperation with the United Nations made "no practical sense."
"The idea of an arbitrary, a priori deadline is something that simply won't work," he said this evening before the first of two rounds of meetings with Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz. "This work can be done quite quickly with full Iraqi cooperation," he added. But, he insisted, "it will end when it ends."
United Nations officials said there would be no public statements about the talks until they were concluded.
Critics of continued sanctions have asked that, at the very least, the United Nations Special Commission begin closing files one by one, to induce Iraq to cooperate more fully.
Once a file on a subject is closed, intrusive and abrupt inspections give way to a long-range monitoring system like those that accompany arms control treaties.
Addressing Iraqi protests on this issue, Mr. Butler, who heads the Special Commission, said that two groups of technical experts would soon meet to explore the possibility of closing files. One is to review the documents on special warheads capable of delivering chemical and biological weapons, and the other is to study evidence that Iraq produced the deadly nerve gas known as VX.
These reviews, however, have proved a two-edged sword. When experts were asked last year to review Iraq's claims of having accounted for all biological weapons and production sites, they called the claims "not remotely credible."
In December, Iraq again declared itself free of germ warfare.
"We don't agree," Mr. Butler said. "We don't agree, not because we are suspicious people, but because disarmament can't be decided on the basis of declaration alone. It has to be verifiable."
Mr. Butler repeated Security Council calls for unfettered access to all suspect sites. He said there was Council agreement on that point.
He was repeatedly questioned about William Scott Ritter Jr., the former United States marine whose team was barred for two days from inspections. Mr. Ritter left Baghdad on Friday, a day ahead of schedule.
"I'm going to get tired soon of the personalization stuff," Mr. Butler said in exasperated tones. "I mean, it really has to stop. I've said over and over again: the man in question is a professional. He is not a spy. He works for the United Nations. I don't want to have to say it again."
Mr. Butler said that Mr. Ritter had been asked to look for evidence of germ warfare testing on inmates during a prison visit last week, but only as part of a "subset" of questions about the prison. In a letter to the Security Council last week, Iraq's representative to the United Nations, Nizar Hamdoon, listed the search for evidence of germ warfare as one grievance against Mr. Ritter.
"I was stunned when the Iraqi permanent representative put that into the public arena," Mr. Butler said, adding that he had intended not to publicize these long-held suspicions because he knew Iraq would be sensitive about them.
Mr. Butler called the Iraqi fixation on Mr. Ritter a diversion from the real issue, which was that Mr. Ritter's team had special expertise in concealment.
"This is not a subject with which Iraq feels comfortable," he said. "The closer we get to the end, the closer we get to the last pieces that have been 'concealed' -- quote, unquote -- of course that makes it tougher."
"The last lap of this race may be the hardest lap," he said. "But we've got to run it. Otherwise, Lord knows what will happen."

HEADLINE: Starwood Says It Has Arranged Financing for ITT Acquisition

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

 BODY:
Starwood Hotels and Resorts Trust has obtained more than $7 billion in financing that will allow it to complete its $10.2 billion acquisition of the ITT Corporation, a hotel and casino company, Starwood's chairman and chief executive, Barry S. Sternlicht, said yesterday.
"The deal will not unravel," Mr. Sternlicht said in an interview, calling the financing "the largest of its type ever done for a real estate transaction." 
 Another casino company, Circus Enterprises, which has been the subject of takeover speculation, said yesterday that its chairman and chief executive, Clyde T. Turner, had resigned.
The Starwood financing, which is being provided by nine financial institutions led by Bankers Trust and Chase Manhattan Bank, will be used to pay as much as $3 billion in cash needed for the cash-and-stock acquisition. The remainder of the funds will be used to refinance some debt, provide working capital and finance other acquisitions.
There had been some speculation in the market that the financing was proving difficult. But Paul Keung, a hotel analyst with Deutsche Morgen Grenfell, said the loan was never in doubt. Rather, the issue was what interest rate the company would obtain because it is highly leveraged.
Mr. Sternlicht acknowledged that the financing "was more difficult than anticipated" because Japanese banks, burdened by bad debts, were reluctant to lend money. No Japanese banks are among the nine participants in the credit package. As for the terms, he said the "end pricing is in line with what we expected."
The package consists of a five-year loan, a revolving credit line and a bridge loan to be paid back within one year through the sale of noncore businesses. Last month, Starwood agreed to sell ITT's telephone directory business for $2.1 billion. Mr. Sternlicht said the company planned to sell ITT's educational services business and perhaps some hotels in areas where Starwood and ITT own properties near one another.
Starwood, based in Phoenix, won a bitter battle in November with the Hilton Hotels Corporation to acquire ITT, which owns the Sheraton hotel chain and Caesars casinos. Starwood's ability to outbid Hilton stemmed in part from the higher stock valuation it has as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, which carries certain tax advantages.
Since then, there has been anticipation that other casino companies might be acquired by REITs. On Friday, Crescent Real Estate Equities, a REIT, agreed to buy Station Casinos Inc. for $635 million in stock. REIT's such as Vornado Realty Trust and Patriot American Hospitality Inc. are said to have been looking at casinos.
Circus Circus has been at the center of such rumors. The company's stock, which fell more than 40 percent last year as it was hurt by a glut of hotel rooms in Las Vegas, Nev., has in the last month climbed from about $20 to close at $25.50 on Friday.
The company has not commented on the rumors.
Circus said the chief operating officer, Michael S. Ensign, would assume Mr. Turner's posts in addition to his own. Circus also said it would take a charge of 8 cents a share in the fourth quarter to settle Mr. Turner's employment contract.

HEADLINE: Merger by 2 Russian Tycoons Creates an Oil Colossus

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Jan. 19

 BODY:
Two of Russia's most powerful tycoons merged their oil companies today, creating a politically potent enterprise with control over one of the world's largest oil reserves.
The move, the largest merger in the brief history of Russian capitalism, was immediately blessed by Russia's Prime Minister, who spent much of his own career in the country's state-owned energy industry. 
 It brings together Mikhail Khodorkovsky, a former Communist youth official turned banker who now chairs the Yukos oil company, and Boris A. Berezovsky, a former national security aide whose business empire includes the Sibneft oil company.
The new oil company, Yuksi, is the world's 11th largest oil producer. And the merger gives it the opportunity to grow even bigger. Russia's state oil company, Rosneft, will be sold at auction later this year, and Yuksi will be in position to make a competitive bid, provided that it attracts a Western partner.
"The objective of this combination is to create a world-scale and world-class integrated oil company with strategically located operations throughout Russia," Mr. Khodorkovsky said.
The politics of today's move, however, are as intriguing as the economics. Russia is enmeshed in a tumultuous debate over what type of capitalist system it should have: a free market with genuine competition or "crony capitalism," dominated by a small group of wealthy financiers and businessmen with inside influence.
The merger represents a long-expected consolidation of Russia's vast oil industry, but it also strengthens the role of Mr. Berezovsky, a leading member of Russia's small oligarchy and a bitter opponent of the Government's leading economic reformers, Boris Nemtsov and Anatoly B. Chubais.
The reformers angered Mr. Berezovsky when they sought to end insider deals in the Government's privatization auctions. They have come under a withering assault ever since by newspapers controlled by Mr. Berezovsky and his allies.
Mr. Berezovky has never detailed his relationship with Sibneft. Mr. Khodorkovsky, however, said today that Mr. Berezovsky would become one of the major shareholders in Yuksi because of his interest in Sibneft.
Today's move is part of a broader shakeout among Russian oil companies, as powerful companies gobble up their smaller competitors.
The two companies being merged into Yuksi produced 1.3 million barrels a day in 1997. That was 22 percent of Russia's crude oil production and substantially more than Lukoil, which has now been displaced as Russia's biggest oil company. And Mr. Khodorkovsky said the new concern hoped to boost production to 2 million barrels a day over the next several years.
The merger, which is expected to take a year or more to complete, will encompass four oil-producing fields, five refineries and some of the world's largest proven oil reserves. Mr. Khodorkovsky will head the new company, which will be 60 percent owned by Yukos and 40 percent owned by Sibneft.
Analysts say the production puts the company behind only Royal Dutch/Shell and Exxon among publicly traded companies. But Yuksi is 11th overall in terms of oil production.
A key question, however, is whether the merger will create a more efficient company that can attract Western partners and compete in the global marketplace, or a huge politically well-connected -- but mismanaged -- corporation.
Both Yukos and Sibneft have repeatedly been accused of compensating for poor management and cash-flow problems by stripping assets from their subsidiaries. Stock analysts and brokers here -- including Creditanstalt and Brunswick Brokerage -- have issued reports warning that minority shareholders in Yukos- and Sibneft-controlled subsidiaries are at risk.
Mr. Khodorkovsky denied the charges today and said he was prepared to have his handling of subsidiaries examined by "international banks and legal companies -- but impartial banks, not banks that represent the interests of the opposite side."
The origins of today's merger go back several months to when Mr. Khodorkovsky and Mr. Berezovky were discussing a joint bid for the state oil company, Rosneft.
The 33-year-old Mr. Khodorkovsky had risen from being an official in the Komsomol, the Communist youth organization, to found Menatep bank. He made a fortune trading in currency, commodities and oil and expanded into metallurgy, chemicals and light industry. But more recently he has set his sights on becoming an oil baron.
Despite his current efforts to court a Western partner, Mr. Khodorkovsky's relations with Western oil companies have not always been harmonious.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS;
Japanese Stocks Help Lift Yen As Traders Gain Confidence

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
A rise in Japanese stocks helped lift the yen against the dollar in currency trading yesterday.
In Tokyo, the Nikkei index of 225 issues, which surged 6.11 percent, closed yesterday up 215.59 points, or 1.34 percent, at 16,262.04. Today, the Nikkei rose another 104.49 points, or six-tenths of 1 percent. 
 The recent gains in the Japanese stock market have bolstered traders' confidence that the Japanese Government is taking concrete steps to salvage the sagging economy.
"There is investor confidence that this crisis will be overcome," said Dennis Heidt, a trader at Banque Paribas.
During Asian trading, currency traders were initially buoyed by a weekend report in the newspaper Asahi Shimbun that a top Japanese Cabinet official had told United States officials that Japan would take additional steps by April to salvage the ailing Japanese economy.
Traders bought up yen until the report was later denied, slowing the rally in the yen.
In Germany, the mark was hurt by a weekend magazine report that quoted Germany's top central banker as saying he doubted that Italy would join Europe's initial conversion to a single currency in 1999. Italy had been seen as getting its house in order to meet the stringent criteria for joining the currency union. The Bundesbank later denied that its president, Hans Tietmeyer, had made the remark.
In early trading in New York, the dollar was quoted at 128.88 yen, down from 129.30 yen on Friday. The dollar also traded at 1.8363 marks, up from 1.8336 marks. The pound was quoted at $1.6385, up from $1.6335.
With financial markets in the United States closed yesterday for Martin Luther King Jr. Day, trading was thin. Most trading in New York ended by 10 A.M., as London wound up its day. "By early morning, everything that had to be done was done," said a foreign exchange strategist for I.D.E.A. Inc. in New York.
In addition to Japan's market, other Asian markets were sharply higher yesterday. Hong Kong stocks rose 500.38 points, or 5.62 percent. In South Korea, stocks gained 32.86 points, or 6.63 percent.
The gains in Asia gave a lift to European markets. In London, stocks retreated a bit after reaching a 15-week high. The Financial Times Stock Exchange index closed up 10.5 points, or two-tenths of 1 percent, at 5,273.6.

HEADLINE: Clinton Plan to Widen Medicare Can't Pay for Itself, Experts Say

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 19

 BODY:
Insurance experts say they doubt that President Clinton's proposal to open Medicare to people 55 to 64 years old would pay for itself, because, they say, sicker and costlier patients would be the ones most likely to sign up for the new coverage.
In the last two weeks, Mr. Clinton and other Administration officials have repeatedly described the proposal as fiscally responsible and "self-financing." They insist that the new beneficiaries would pay the entire cost, so that there would be no need for Federal subsidies, no risk to the Medicare trust fund and no cost to current beneficiaries. 
 But Robert J. Myers, who was chief actuary of the Social Security Administration for 23 years; William F. Bluhm, vice president of the American Academy of Actuaries, and Julia T. Philips, a health actuary who works for the Minnesota Insurance Commissioner, said in interviews that they doubted that Mr. Clinton's plan would pay for itself at the premium rates he has proposed.
Roland E. King, chief actuary of the Medicare program from 1978 to 1994, voiced similar doubts.
Consumer advocates and health policy analysts praised Mr. Clinton for highlighting the insurance needs of people 55 to 64. But they said Federal subsidies, to help pay the cost of Medicare coverage for some members of that group, might be necessary and would be justified.
Senator John H. Chafee, a Rhode Island Republican who for years has advocated Federal efforts to broaden health insurance coverage, expressed the skepticism of many on Capitol Hill that the proposal would pay for itself as Mr. Clinton contends.
"I don't believe that at all," the Senator said.
Mr. Myers, who is widely respected by actuaries and members of Congress, predicted that relatively few people would buy Medicare coverage under the President's proposal, and he said, "The ones who take it would be the high-cost cases."
As a result, "it will be almost impossible to establish an adequate premium rate," Mr. Myers said, "one that would involve no additional cost to the Medicare system or to the Government."
In a separate interview today, Ms. Philips said: "It's practically certain that the premiums will not cover the costs. It's unlikely to be self-supporting."
Even some people who support Mr. Clinton's proposal have questions about the adequacy of the premiums in the long run. Asked if the new program would be self-financing, Robert E. McGarrah Jr., a health policy expert at the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said, "I really don't see how it could be."
White House officials have thoroughly analyzed the Medicare proposal from the perspective of health policy and politics alike but are still wrestling with some financial questions.
Chris Jennings, a White House aide who coordinates health policy, said he could not explain exactly how the premiums had been computed. Mr. Jennings, repeatedly asked for details in the last two weeks, said today that he still did not have "anything on paper."
Rahm I. Emanuel, a senior adviser to the President, said:
"The Republicans want to talk numbers. We will talk about individual real-life stories. And we will keep pounding the Republicans until Congress approves our proposal."
Under Mr. Clinton's proposal, people 62 to 64 could buy full Medicare coverage -- both hospital care and doctors' services -- for a premium of $300 a month. That, according to the White House, is "the average cost of insuring Americans in this age range."
In developing its proposal, the Administration assumed that people seeking such coverage would be somewhat sicker than the average and would have health costs above the norm for people 62 to 64. Mr. Clinton said the extra costs could be fully offset by requiring these people to pay a surcharge on the standard premium after they reach the age of 65.
"Participants would pay an additional monthly payment, estimated at $10 to $20, for each year that they buy into the Medicare program," Mr. Clinton said. The current premium -- for Part B, covering doctors' services and other outpatient care -- is $43.80 a month.
Mr. Clinton said the extra premium would "cover the extra costs of sicker participants."
But Mr. King, the former chief actuary for Medicare, said people who enrolled early, being sicker than average, would have higher mortality rates and might not survive long enough to pay back the cost of the care they received before reaching 65.
The greater tendency of sick people to buy health insurance is known among insurance experts as adverse selection. The people voluntarily buying coverage are more likely to need costly medical care than the people who pass up the opportunity.
Administration officials and their allies in Congress say this is a manageable problem. If the premiums are too low to cover the cost of expanding Medicare, they say, the Government can simply raise the premiums.
That approach seems plausible, but insurance experts say they doubt that it will work.
"If you raise the rates, healthier people leave the program, and you lose money," Ms. Philips said. "The average claims per person go up. You raise the rates again to try to stop the losses. Relatively healthier people leave. The people who stay in the program are those who know or expect that they will be using the benefits."
Mr. Bluhm said that even a modest amount of "adverse selection" could undermine the finances of an insurance program, because 20 percent of the subscribers typically account for 80 percent of the costs. He described adverse selection as "the annoying tendency people have to do what's best for themselves." It can be a major problem for Medicare, because just 5 percent of elderly beneficiaries account for more than half of all Medicare spending on the elderly.
In a report to Congress last year, the President's Council of Economic Advisers said, "Adverse selection is a potentially serious problem for many types of insurance markets." It explained the vicious circle this way: "Those who expect to incur losses are more likely to buy insurance than those who do not. This raises average expenses per beneficiary and forces insurance companies to raise premiums. Higher premiums discourage people with lower risks from buying insurance."
There are many examples of this circumstance. Under a 1986 law, workers who lose their jobs can usually keep their health insurance for 18 months if they pay the full premium paid by the employer and active workers, plus 2 percent. People who take advantage of this option often need health care, and the cost of their medical claims is about 50 percent higher than that of active workers, according to annual surveys by Charles D. Spencer & Associates, a publisher of employee benefits data.
William S. Custer, an associate professor of risk management and insurance at Georgia State University in Atlanta, said:
"You've got to be realistic. This is not going to be self-financing in the way the Administration describes it. You are trying to reach a very vulnerable population, and it's unrealistic to expect that these beneficiaries will, as a group, be able to pay for their own coverage when you consider the effects of adverse selection. You will have to rely on another tax source, either the payroll tax or general revenues."
About half the states have established programs to provide health insurance to people with medical problems who cannot obtain or afford coverage in the private market.
Ryland B. Musick, director of the Florida program, known as the Florida Comprehensive Health Association, said he doubted that the proposed expansion of Medicare would pay for itself.
"There are some healthy folks in that category under 65," Mr. Musick said, "but many others are medically uninsurable. It will be a challenge to break even without a subsidy. If it requires a subsidy, it would be an excellent investment."

HEADLINE: Pataki Urges $3 Billion Plan For Campuses, Doubling Total

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 19

 BODY:
As he prepared to release his election-year budget on Tuesday, Gov. George E. Pataki today proposed doubling state spending on campus improvements in the state and city university systems, with a $3 billion, five-year capital program.
The plan marks a stark turnabout from Mr. Pataki's first three years in office, when he cut state support for public colleges, raised tuition and reduced aid to poor students. The reversal is made possible by a healthy economy and a prolonged boom on Wall Street that have given the state a budget surplus three years running. 
 Aides to the Governor said today that the state's surplus would reach $1.8 billion by the end of the fiscal year on March 31, the largest surplus in state history. That has enabled Mr. Pataki to enter his re-election campaign doling out state money to popular programs and proposing tax cuts, and to avoid the politically divisive spending cuts that marked the first half of his term.
In the $69 billion budget he is to propose on Tuesday, the Governor will seek to spread much of the state's new wealth to education, one of the programs most favored by voters and one that Mr. Pataki often sought to cut in previous years. Over the weekend, he said he would seek an increase of more than 4 percent in state aid to primary and secondary schools, the largest rise proposed by a governor since the 1980's. If history is any guide, the Legislature will demand -- and the final budget will contain -- more for schools and universities than in the Governor's proposal.
Mr. Pataki's office released details of his capital program for higher education today but would not say what the 1998-99 budget would hold for operating aid to the universities or tuition assistance for the poor.
In the City University, Queens College would get the biggest benefits in the first year, the only year for which the Governor specified which projects would be financed. The campus would get $28 million to renovate Powdermaker Hall, the main academic building, and $15 million for an AIDS research center to be headed by Prof. Luc Montagnier, a discoverer of the AIDS virus, who was hired last year from the Pasteur Institute in Paris.
The State University at Stony Brook would be another big winner, with $17 million for renovation of its engineering building and $10 million for a sports stadium.
University officials praised the plan,which follows a decade of austerity. The plan was first reported today in Newsday. "The university is extremely pleased about the plan," said Jay Hershenson, vice chancellor of the City University. "It helps CUNY campuses in all of the five boroughs, and significantly enhances the teaching, learning and research environment."
In recent years, the state has spent about $250 million a year on capital improvements for public two-year and four-year colleges and graduate schools. The plan announced today would increase that to $515 million a year for five years, and the state universities would be called on to raise an additional $85 million a year on their own -- through hospital operations, donations and other efforts -- for a total of $600 million a year.
Of the $515 million a year in direct state aid, $315 million would go to the 65-campus State University system and $200 million to the 19-campus City University system, roughly the same proportion as in the past. All the state money would be raised through the sale of bonds -- totaling almost $2.6 billion -- despite criticism from fiscal monitors that the state is already too deeply in debt.
Most of the money would go to renovate buildings that are in disrepair. More than $60 million a year would go for technology like wiring classrooms for computers.
"The Governor recognizes that investment in education is important to the success of its students," said Zenia Mucha, Mr. Pataki's communications director.
Officials in both systems said the Governor adhered closely to the universities' own lists of top priorities in assigning money to specific projects.
But in 1995 and 1996, Mr. Pataki pushed through cuts in the operating budgets of the two systems and a $750-a-year increase in tuition at four-year colleges, a rise of 28 to 31 percent. Even last year, with a state surplus like this year's, he proposed more cuts and tuition increases, but the Legislature refused.
"It's an election year, after all, and this will help deflect criticism of his track record on higher education," Blair Horner, a lobbyist for the New York Public Interest Research Group, said of the Governor's plan.
Mr. Horner, whose group lobbies for more money for higher education, said some of the state's surplus should be used to reverse cuts in operating aid that began during the last recession. "We applaud the Governor's proposal to invest in brick and mortar," he said. "We hope that he and the Legislature will also invest in flesh and blood, by reducing tuition and increasing financial aid."
The average cost of full-time enrollment at one of New York's public colleges has tripled in the last decade. Public college tuition in New York is the 12th highest of any state, according to the Federal Department of Education. Four-year college tuition is $3,200 a year in the city system and $3,400 a year in the state system, and students typically pay an additional $500 annually in fees.
The first-year projects Mr. Pataki proposed include $22 million for Brooklyn College to build the West Quad section of the campus, $12 million to renovate Shepard Hall at City College and financing for a classroom building at Baruch College.

HEADLINE: Faith in a Moral Motive for Work;
The Man Who Redesigned Welfare in Wisconsin Is Coming

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE 

 BODY:
Some teen-agers doodle away the hours drawing race cars or basketball plays. As a high school student in the late 1960's, Jason A. Turner used to draft plans for factories that would put welfare recipients to work.
"I just did it -- not for class," he once said, describing the passion for workfare programs that gripped him early in life. "One of the things that sustained me was I believed I had a solution: 'Hey, listen guys, this is it!' " 
 Among those now lending an ear is Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who named Mr. Turner on Jan. 7 to run the City Human Resources Administration. The move brings one of the nation's most zealous supporters of work requirements to the city where they may meet their toughest test.
At 44, Mr. Turner is a burly, affable, self-effacing man with an unusual sense of mission and more street smarts than the average welfare theorist. An Ivy League graduate from a boarding-school background, he has been a political appointee in the Reagan and Bush Administrations and an architect of Wisconsin's ambitious work program. But he also did college stints as a taxi driver in Houston, and he once sought his fortune as a low-income landlord, only to lose a three-year battle with the neighborhood's crack dealers.
What he has not done is run a program as big as the one he now inherits. New York City has about 10 times as many welfare recipients as Milwaukee, Wisconsin's largest city.
The design of his policies -- as well as his own famously long hours -- make it clear that Mr. Turner views work as more than just an economic necessity. His welfare theories are grounded in the faith that work morally transforms those who perform it, rich and poor alike. "Work is one's own gift to others, and when you sever that relationship with your fellow man, you're doing more than just harm to yourself economically," he said in an interview last spring. "You're doing spiritual harm."
In announcing Mr. Turner's appointment, the Mayor praised his work in Wisconsin, where he helped design a program striking in both its generosity and toughness. It offers welfare recipients extensive child care, job-placement services and, if needed, a community service job.
But it also tolerates virtually no exemptions and it punishes those who fail to comply by withdrawing all cash support.
It remains unclear how much of that vision Mr. Turner hopes to transport to New York City, where unemployment is higher, unions are stronger, the bureaucracy is more unwieldy and the ideological enemies of work programs are more numerous. Untested as a large-scale administrator, Mr. Turner will preside over an agency with 14,000 employees and a $5.8 billion budget at the same time he seeks to transform its institutional culture. And much of his success will depend on creating a relationship with Mayor Giuliani, a man he met only recently.
It is a sign of the challenges -- and the potential for missteps -- that neither Mr. Giuliani nor Mr. Turner would comment last week on their plans. But in his State of the City address last week, the Mayor outlined a welfare vision that sounded much like the Wisconsin program. "We will establish a universal work requirement for everyone receiving benefits," he said. "Other than for severe disabilities, there will be few exceptions."
Mr. Turner's appointment drew high praise from conservative supporters of work programs. "Jason is the most effective welfare reformer in the country," said Robert Rector of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research organization in Washington. Mr. Rector went on to say, however, that "the alignment of forces against reform are much stronger in New York than they are in Wisconsin."
In interviews last year, Mr. Turner said he first grew interested in welfare as a junior high school student, after reading a magazine story on fraud. As the son of a prosperous advertising executive in Darien, Conn., he said, "it just hadn't occurred to me that there were whole classes of people who didn't work, and who basically existed on government charity."
His faith in the work ethic stemmed partly from his maternal grandfather, a Princeton-educated banker who lost his job in the Depression but went on to support his family as a door-to-door brush salesman. Mr. Turner briefly flirted with liberalism as a student at Columbia University. (He voted for George S. McGovern for President in 1972.) But his concern about social order reawakened after he was twice robbed at gunpoint while driving a cab on college vacations.
After working on the 1980 Reagan campaign, Mr. Turner landed an appointment as a junior Federal housing official. Unable to gain an audience for his welfare ideas, he left in 1985 and sank his retirement savings into several small apartment buildings in Washington, only to lose everything.
Mr. Turner returned to government in 1989 as a senior Federal welfare official, but found little support for bold action inside the Bush Administration. Out of office after the 1992 election, he surprised friends by accepting a second-tier bureaucratic appointment in Wisconsin because he was convinced that Gov. Tommy G. Thompson would make sweeping changes.
The program Mr. Turner helped build is distinguished by two features. One is its uncompromising insistence on work. Unlike many states, Wisconsin offers no period of temporary cash aid in which recipients can pursue training or sort out life crises. From the start, virtually everyone is expected to work 30 hours a week -- either with a private employer, or in a community service job if private work cannot be found.
In addition, Mr. Turner established an unusual system of bureaucratic competition. He required county governments to meet specified goals, including caseload reduction, or face bids from private contractors.
Beyond his role as a policy architect, Mr. Turner was also known as a tenacious policy implementer. At one point, his responsibilities included overseeing the work program in Milwaukee. When working in his state policy office in Madison, he sometimes stayed so late that he slept on the floor rather than commute 80 miles to his Milwaukee home. (Mr. Turner and his wife, Angie, now have four young children, including year-old twin boys and a month-old daughter.)
The criticism of Mr. Turner, like the praise, centers on his relentless emphasis on work. In his drive to impose new work rules last year, he set up a computer system short on record-keeping safeguards. As a result, thousands of recipients in Milwaukee temporarily lost their benefits, even while showing up to work.
And while the Wisconsin plan has been praised for its investments in job development and child care, it tends to assume that those services are all that is needed.
So far, the Wisconsin system has given only limited thought to recipients who, for whatever reason, fail to hold the jobs. Some have alcohol or drug problems. Some have mental health problems. Others are tangled in violent relationships at home. In a work-or-else system, some clearly fall through the cracks.
"We're expecting a lot of people who just don't have their lives together to get a job," said Anne Arnesen, the director of the Wisconsin Council on Children and Families, an advocacy group in Madison. "It's hurting women who are not ready for the workplace."
Since imposing work requirements, Wisconsin has seen its caseloads fall nearly 70 percent, with only modest rises in homelessness or other measures of social distress. But as in New York, there is no reliable information on what happens to recipients after they leave the rolls.
In New York, Mr. Turner will face larger challenges on every front. With about 246,000 families on the rolls, New York City has a caseload six times that of Wisconsin. Its unemployment rate is 8.7 percent, compared with 3.4 percent in Wisconsin. And so far Mr. Turner has succeeded as a behind-the-scenes mechanic, not a public spokesman. He has never held the top bureaucratic job.
What's more, the political environment in New York is much more contentious than it is in Wisconsin. Advocacy groups are more deeply opposed to work requirements, especially for women with young children. And New York's conservatives have not shown Governor Thompson's willingness to invest money.
Mr. Giuliani's work program already includes about 32,000 participants, making it by far the largest in the country. Merely by establishing such a sizable program, the Mayor exceeded conventional expectations. But about three-quarters of its participants are single adults, and Mr. Turner will now confront the tougher problems of women with children.
In an interview last summer, Mr. Turner worried about the competence of big-city bureaucracies, and he said New York posed a special challenge. "New York has real ideological warfare and has had for years," he said. "Where there's real hard and fast lines drawn, it makes it real hard to define and run a program. It takes the wind out of your sails at the implementation level."
He did praise Mr. Giuliani, before meeting him, for "being able to get a big work program up and running." But he also worried that the New York City program was "reaching the end of the easy enrollment" and predicted "they can't go further" without a major new effort. That was before he understood that the major new effort would be his.

HEADLINE: First Stop a Tough One For Panel on Gambling

BYLINE: By BRETT PULLEY 

DATELINE: ATLANTIC CITY, Jan. 16

 BODY:
The Atlantic City Rescue Mission, a huge, modern building that sits amid run-down houses just a few blocks from the Boardwalk, offers a look at the good and bad of the gambling boom that has swept the country over the past 20 years.
Many of the more than 3,000 people who come to the mission each year looking for food and shelter are gamblers who failed to quit before their luck and money ran out. 
 On the other hand, the mission has no trouble accommodating all comers, nongamblers included, thanks to the casinos.
Last year, the Trump Taj Mahal and the Trump Marina gave $294,000 in food to the mission. In 1996, Bally's casino helped pay down the mortgage on the mission's nine-year-old building by donating $866,000. And last year alone, the city's 12 casinos contributed more than $1 million to the mission.
"If the casinos weren't here," said Barry K. Durman, the mission's chief executive, "you wouldn't need a mission this size. And if the casinos weren't supporting us, we wouldn't be able to serve the number of people we serve."
On Wednesday, gambling experts, casino officials and reporters will descend on the mission in one of the first stops for the National Gambling Impact Study Commission, a panel appointed by President Clinton and Congress to examine the social and economic consequences of legalized gambling in the United States. With the $40 billion-a-year gaming industry facing its closest scrutiny ever, gambling's advocates and opponents alike are converging on this city, vying for the attention of the nine-member commission during the two-day meeting.
"Everyone wants us to see Atlantic City through their eyes," said Kay Coles James, the chairwoman of the commission. "I suspect that no one on either side is going to be entirely happy with how we do it."
There is no Federal oversight of gambling operations, other than those on Indian reservations. But since the commission was formed several months ago, gambling interests have been fearful that the commission could recommend Federal regulations, increased taxes and other measures to control the continued growth of their industry.
The legislation that led to the commission's formation was pushed by Representative Frank R. Wolf, Republican of Virginia, and at first called for the study of the "negative" effects of gambling. Pro-gaming forces, however, lobbied to have the language changed to make it a study of the "social and economic impacts" of the industry. Still, gambling proponents, who have lined up powerful Washington lobbyists, have repeatedly expressed their concern that the industry will not get an impartial review.
"There have been a series of things during the life of the commission that create the impression that rather than going down the middle and examining things, they're going to skew things in favor of those who are opposed to gambling," said Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr., chief executive of the American Gaming Association, the industry's trade group.
The commission plans to visit other major gambling centers throughout the year and has until June 1999 to complete its work and issue a report to the President and Congress.
In the days leading to the meeting, the lobbying has been intense and the complaining about the commission's approach has been at a high pitch. Hoping to show off some of the things that gambling revenues have helped pay for -- his city's new $83 million senior high school and its 4,800 new housing units -- Atlantic City's Mayor, James Whelan, invited the commissioners to take a bus tour of the city. Senator Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey, a Democrat who is one of the casino industry's strongest allies in Washington, offered to take the commission members to dinner to discuss the economic development projects under way in the city.
Despite these efforts, when the commission released its agenda for the meeting earlier this month, the proponents of gambling cried foul.
Other than their two days of presentations from government officials, and testimony from the public and experts on pathological gambling, the panel members had scheduled visits to only the rescue mission, a shop that pays cash for jewelry and the Trump Taj Mahal.
"I was furious," Mr. Torricelli said. "I wanted them to see that Atlantic City is not a finished project and that it is on a launching pad. From the new high school to the housing, none of this would have happened without gaming."
The commission, Mr. Torricelli said, "should have never existed, but since it was created we have to make the best of a bad situation."
Much of the criticism over the commission's objectivity has been directed at its chairwoman, Mrs. James, who is a religious conservative, a former Bush Administration official and the dean of the school of government at Regent University, the Virginia institution started by the Christian Coalition's founder, Pat Robertson.
Mrs. James's first choice as the commission's full-time executive director, James Kilgore, was forced to withdraw last summer after gambling advocates learned that he had declared his opposition to gambling when he ran for Virginia Attorney General. Mrs. James had assured the panel that Mr. Kilgore had never taken a position on gambling. Nancy Mohr Kennedy was subsequently chosen to direct the commission's staff and its $4 million budget.
Then last fall, when Mrs. James hired a research director, Timothy Kelly, she came under attack again because Mr. Kelly, commissioner of Virginia's mental health department, had done past research work as a consultant for the Family Research Council, a conservative group.
The selection of Mr. Kelly, Mrs. James said in a recent interview, was based solely on his ability as a researcher.
"There has been an entire litany of criticisms to the point that I've wondered if it's an attempt to discredit me and the commission so that at the end of the day you can discredit the report," she said.
In recent days, after further discussions with Atlantic City officials, Mrs. James decided to add the Mayor's bus tour to the agenda.
"There is no predisposition to slant our visit in any way," she said. "Any objective observer, looking at how we're going to spend our time in Atlantic City, would have to determine that it is a very fair and balanced approach."
The commission's makeup is actually balanced, with some people who are considered pro-gambling, some who are opposed to it and some who have no strong prior positions on the issue.
Its members include J. Terrence Lanni, the chairman and chief executive of MGM Grand, the casino and hotel company based in Nevada. At least two or three other members are viewed as likely proponents of the industry. Because of her religious conservatism, Mrs. James is believed to be opposed to gambling, although she has insisted that she plans to approach the study without bias. James C. Dobson, founder of Focus on the Family, is considered one of the staunchest gambling foes on the commission.
Gambling opponents have their own concerns about the commission, worrying that the financial muscle and political influence of the casino industry could unduly influence it.
"People on our side are saying the deck is stacked against us because people like Lanni are on the commission," said Tom Grey, the executive director of the National Coalition Against Gambling Expansion.
Mr. Grey, who is clearly enjoying all the anxiety that the commission has created in the industry, said the constant complaints from casino proponents suggested that the industry was not a harmless form of entertainment, as its executives contend.
"Never have I seen such tough people whine and complain so much," Mr. Grey said in a telephone interview. "If this is such a great product like they say it is, then they've got a national commission to show it off to."
On Wednesday night, the commission is to hear testimony from over 100 people. The first eight speakers are members of Gamblers Anonymous. And on Thursday, the commission will hear from experts on compulsive gambling, a problem that casinos acknowledge but contend has been exaggerated by opponents.
"I think it could be more than just an abstract discussion of the problem," said Leo T. McCarthy, the former Lieutenant Governor of California and a member of the commission. "Some useful statistics could come from this testimony."
And Mr. Durman, the executive director of the rescue mission, knows that people on both sides hope to score points in their tour on Wednesday. He is putting the finishing touches on a report and survey that he expects to hand out, which will reveal what percentage of his clients seek help from the mission as a result of gambling.
He is also expecting to get the dirty, tattered carpet in the family lounge replaced before the tour. A new roll of carpet was donated by Caesars Palace.

Asia Troubles Affecting Boeing Orders

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Jan. 19

 BODY:
The Boeing Company may have to delay deliveries of jetliners to Malaysian Airline System Bhd. and Philippine Airlines Inc., as Asian airlines struggle to pay for orders made before the region's financial crisis.
Executives of Boeing, the world's biggest aircraft maker, will probably meet this week with Malaysian Airline executives, a Boeing spokesman, Mark Hooper, said. Malaysian Airline is seeking to change a schedule that would have it take delivery of 19 aircraft by 2001, the state news agency reported, citing an interview with the airline's chairman. 
 Seattle-based Boeing is in discussions with Philippine Airlines, which has seven aircraft on order, according to a Boeing spokeswoman, Carie Cable. All seven are 747-400 jumbo jets and together would cost a total of $1.18 billion at official prices, though discounts are nearly always given.
Last week, Philippine Airlines said it had canceled plans to buy four 747-400's.
Asian airlines make up about 30 percent of Boeing's order backlog. The devaluation of Asian currencies is making it harder for countries to pay for new aircraft and to forecast the need for jets.
Boeing said no airline had canceled any orders because of the Asian crisis, though as many as 60 airplane deliveries may be delayed in the next three years.

Albright Defends Bailout Role by U.S.

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 19

 BODY:
The Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, denied today that the United States was surrendering too much money and power to the International Monetary Fund.
In an interview, she emphasized the major role the United States plays in I.M.F. decision-making and rejected critics who say that United States-backed I.M.F. rescue packages for Asian economies in financial crisis are "bailing out Wall Street." 
 "We are a major part of the I.M.F." and have substantial voting power under the institution's weighted voting system, Ms. Albright said.
Bailouts for Asia's battered economies have brought debate in Washington over President Clinton's economic priorities and the issue of whether the United States is surrendering too much to the I.M.F.
During the interview at the State Department, Ms. Albright asserted that countries receiving bailouts -- South Korea, Indonesia and Thailand -- "have a strong resource base and they need to be allowed to have some breathing space to get themselves back on their feet."
Without such assistance, the crisis would continue with potentially negative consequences for the United States economy, she said.

HEADLINE: Japan and U.S. Draw Closer to Agreement to Liberalize Air Travel

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
United States and Japanese negotiators have agreed on the broad outlines of a deal that would greatly increase the number of flights between the two countries and liberalize travel across the Pacific, airline executives and officials in the Clinton Administration said yesterday.
But the two sides, which open a new round of talks today in Washington, still face a number of outstanding issues that could make a final agreement in the long-running trade dispute elusive. 
 "You never know what happens in a negotiation," said a senior administration official who insisted on anonymity. "But things are closer than they have ever been."
While the Japanese must still agree on a few key issues, the Administration also faces opposition from members of Congress who feel that the proposed agreement does not go far enough. Last week, Senator Jesse Helms, the powerful chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, urged the Clinton Administration not to conclude a deal before he held hearings on Feb. 12, because the proposed agreement falls short of so-called "open skies," or a full-scale liberalization of air traffic between the two nations.
Mr. Helms said that at a time when the United States was urging Asian countries to deregulate their economies to resolve the region's economic crisis, settling for less than open skies with Japan would send the wrong signal.
But Administration officials countered that they would not agree to any deal that did not significantly liberalize air service to Japan, and they felt confident that they could win over Mr. Helms and other critics. An agreement does not require Senate ratification.
"If this thing gels, it will be a substantial deregulation of the trans-Pacific market," the senior Administration official said. "Will it be total? No. But it will be substantial."
Most of the major American airlines appear to be supporting the proposed agreement with the exception of the Northwest Airlines Corporation, which has the strongest presence in Japan of any American airline and has lobbied strongly against anything short of full liberalization.
"This agreement will transform air transportation as we know it," Gerald Greenwald, the chairman and chief executive of United Airlines, said last week. "It will allow the airline industry to provide convenient access to virtually every major city in the world for the first time."
Japanese airlines long resisted air service liberalization because they feared that they would quickly be overshadowed by American carriers, which are more efficient. But the Japanese have also complained about the unfairness of a bilateral air services deal signed in the aftermath of World War II that gave American airlines more access to Japan than Japanese carriers have to the United States.
Under the terms of the proposed deal, Northwest, United Airlines and the Federal Express Corporation -- the three carriers that currently have the most rights to fly to Japan -- would receive virtually unlimited access to the country. That would allow United, which can now fly only six times a week from its hub in Chicago to Tokyo, to more than double that number and give Federal Express the right to fly cargo from Japan to other destinations in Asia.
In addition, about 90 new flights a week to Tokyo and Osaka would be divided among American Airlines, Delta Air Lines Inc. and Continental Airlines -- which currently are allowed only a few flights to Japan -- as well as to two airlines that currently do not fly to Japan, most likely US Airways and T.W.A.
In exchange, All Nippon Airways, Japan's second-largest airline, would receive unlimited rights to fly to the United States, joining Japan Airlines.
The biggest dispute holding up the agreement is Japan's resistance to allowing American carriers to team up with other airlines, both foreign and domestic, to offer flights to Japan and on to other destinations in Asia. Such so-called code-sharing would allow an American carrier to sell a ticket, say, to Singapore by flying a passenger to Tokyo and then transferring the passenger to a Singapore Airlines flight.
Critics say that the proposed deal does not challenge the Japanese Government's power to control ticket prices, which protects its relatively inefficient airlines by preventing the American carriers from competing by offering lower prices. They also say that the American negotiators have given All Nippon Airways unfettered access to the United States without insuring that American carriers will receive space to land at Tokyo's crowded Narita Airport.
The 90 new flights a week were created only after Federal Express agreed to lend some of the landing slots it was not using to commercial carriers until a second runway is completed at Narita, which could be several years away. And because the slots were designed for cargo planes, the landings and takeoffs are scheduled for early in the morning or late at night, inconvenient times for commercial passengers.
Chris Chiames, a spokesman for American Airlines, said that the Federal Express slots could be traded for more convenient times.

HEADLINE: New Baldness Drug Is Older Product at a Premium Price

BYLINE: By DAVID J. MORROW 

 BODY:
Kenneth Scovotti, a balding 55-year-old manager of a New York City gasoline station, has spent $15,000 for five hair transplants the last four years. So he was elated to learn about Propecia, Merck & Company's new hair-growth drug.
"Whether it works or not, I was determined to try it," Mr. Scovotti said. "The only problem is that it's expensive for a pill." 
 In the week or so since Propecia arrived in America's pharmacies, thousands of men have rushed to doctors' offices for prescriptions. Once at the pharmacy, though, they get a dose of cold reality: Merck is selling Propecia for three times the price, per milligram, that it charges for another of its products that uses the same active ingredient, Proscar, a treatment for enlarged prostates.
Marketing an existing drug under a second name is not new, but raising the price is. Merck defends the premium, citing added research costs.
Still, that math is fast creating a black market for Propecia, even over the Internet, and prompting many balding men to try a home science project and possibly commit insurance fraud. Because one Proscar tablet equals five daily doses of Propecia, users persuade doctors to write them prescriptions for the prostate drug and then slice the pills into five parts.
Propecia costs about $50 for a month's supply, or $250 for five months. A bottle of Proscar tablets, which, after dissection, would also last five months, costs about $70, or $14 a month. By contrast, Rogaine -- Propecia's over-the-counter competitor -- costs about $30 a month.
Proscar tablets are covered by most insurance policies; Propecia usually is not -- not even by Merck's employee health plans. Men who get Proscar tablets and dice them may pay nothing for the pills once the insurer picks up the tab, but the practice could be illegal.
"This is definite fraud," said Uwe Reinhardt, a health economist at Princeton University. "A person's insurance policy is worried about their prostate and has allowed money to pay for that, not to foot the bill for hair to grow on their heads."
Merck executives, meanwhile, are frowning heavily over splitting pills. "We don't recommend that people try to divide Proscar tablets to create a dose of Propecia," said Raymond V. Gilmartin, Merck's chairman and chief executive.
"For one thing, there's the precision involved; Propecia is one milligram of finasteride," Mr. Gilmartin said of the active ingredient. "It's hard to split a pill and come away with exactly that amount."
The price issue has not, of course, caught Merck officials by surprise. To counter the inevitable resistance, Merck is allowing consumers to receive a $10 rebate by buying three bottles in what is called a Propak and is rolling out a discount plan for repeat users.
Merck has rolled out the special deals because the stakes are so high. Between 2000 and 2002, three of Merck's big drugs -- those with yearly sales of $1 billion or more -- will lose patent protection, opening the door for generic versions. To offset an inevitable erosion in revenue, Merck is rolling out five new drugs, including Propecia, that could become billion-dollar sellers.
The company's patent woes, though, are merely a backdrop to the more intricate problem of Propecia's pricing. Glaxo Wellcome, for example, sold bupropion as the antidepressant Wellbutrin for years but spun it off recently as Zyban, a drug to help people quit smoking. The price stayed the same.
Why weren't Propecia users as fortunate? Some Wall Street analysts say Merck had no choice. Merck officials insist that Propecia did not share Proscar's research budget but ran up its own bill, estimated at $450 million.
Even so, the additional markup on Propecia is so great that Merck could recoup its research and development expenses quickly. If 1.35 million men were to use Propecia for just a year, the windfall would total some $450 million.
"There's a myth about Propecia," said Wendy Dixon, vice president for specialty and new-product marketing at Merck. "A lot of stories have said that men in the Proscar studies came back with hair, and that's how we got Propecia. They were two totally different products with two separate clinical studies."
Not only does Merck have to recover Propecia's research expenses, the company is also at greater risk of coming up empty-handed. Propecia users, after all, are not sick, so they can stop taking the drug at any time.
Merck's only remedy is a heavy ad campaign, scheduled to begin later this year. Analysts expect no expense to be spared, which will further swell Propecia's overhead.
"One way or another, consumers are going to pay," said Neil Sweig, an analyst with Southeast Research Partners. "Merck will spend at least $50 million this year promoting Propecia and maybe even $100 million if they believe they need ads to stimulate more sales. With Zyban, you lose the customer once they stop smoking. With Propecia, you can keep them forever, but you'll lose them quick if they get discouraged and quit."
Despite a potential market of 33 million American men who have pattern baldness, putting Propecia in a lot of medicine cabinets will not be easy. Dr. Marc Avram, director of the cosmetic surgical unit at New York Hospital, gets 5 to 10 calls a day from men interested in Propecia, but many later decide against taking it.
"For a lot of men, the cost is the deciding factor," Dr. Avram said. "It takes anywhere from three to six months to see any results, and if you quit, you lose the hair that you've grown. Other men are afraid of some of the possible side effects."
Propecia can cause birth defects and should not be used by women. The Propak box has a warning that women should not even hold a broken or crushed Propecia tablet. The drug also carries a slight risk of impotence, lasting as long as it is used.
What may be especially problematic, however, is the psychological element. Apparently, no one is immune to being sensitive on the topic of balding. Asked whether he plans to use Propecia, Mr. Gilmartin, who is clearly losing his hair, said he was thinking about it. When, exactly? "That's personal," he said.
It is too early to gauge the success of Merck's repeat-buyer plan, but analysts are enthusiastic. With a Propak, users can buy a three-month supply and receive a $10 rebate. They can also sign up for the Perks Program, enabling repeat Propak buyers to receive $20 rebates for two future purchases.
"We're pushing the Propak because hair grows slowly, usually between three and six months," said Tom Casola, executive director of Merck's dermatology marketing group. "We want them to stay tied to the product until they see it work."
In the meantime, American TV viewers should prepare for a lot of hair commercials. This month, Pharmacia & Upjohn Inc. unleashed an $80 million ad budget to promote extra-strength Rogaine, a topical liquid applied twice daily. Kenneth Vargha, director of marketing for Pharmacia & Upjohn's consumer health care division, said the timing was a coincidence but that he was confident of winning any hair war.
The first hurdle for Merck might be the Internet market. On the Usenet news group alt.baldspot last week, a user in Italy was offering to send Proscar tablets to the United States for just $63 a bottle, or $12.60 for a month's supply of Propecia.
But is hair all it is cracked up to be? "Before people get caught up in Propecia or any hair-replacement treatment," Dr. Avram said, "it might be best for them to consider what they'd look like when they really lose their hair. There's no doubt that it changes someone's looks. But sometimes, the change may be for the better."

HEADLINE: St. Paul to Pay $2.8 Billion For USF&G

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
The St. Paul Companies, one of the nation's largest insurers of corporations, said yesterday that it was acquiring a large competitor, USF& G, for about $2.8 billion in stock, in one of the largest insurance mergers in recent years.
St. Paul, whose chief executive, Douglas W. Leatherdale, will head the combined companies, is also assuming about $700 million in USF& G debt. 
 Mr. Leatherdale and Norman P. Blake Jr., the chief executive of USF& G, said in a joint interview that the merger would yield greater market share and geographic reach for the combined company.
"This is a real reinforcement of the businesses we are strong in," Mr. Blake said.
Both companies are major players in the fields of construction and medical malpractice insurance. St. Paul also has a presence in insuring technology concerns, such as computer companies, and USF& G is a leader in insuring banks, brokerage firms and other financial institutions, as well as municipalities and universities.
"USF& G is strong in the South and Northeast," Mr. Leatherdale said, "and that complements our strength in the Midwest."
Dozens of insurance companies have merged in the last few years. And as larger companies have emerged, many of the remaining companies have sought partners to make sure that they were not squeezed out of the market and to gain economies of scale.
"We think there is an opportunity to take significant cost out of the merged operations," Mr. Leatherdale said.
He estimated that the combined work force of 16,500, including 6,500 USF& G employees and 10,000 at St. Paul, would be reduced over the next 18 months by 1,500 to 2,000.
All together, savings in operating expenses are expected to run to $150 million, Mr. Blake said. St. Paul also expects to take a charge of $300 to $500 million for restructuring related to the merger.
The executives said that they expected the merger to add immediately to the earnings of the combined company, which is to keep the St. Paul name.
Rob Meyers, a managing director at J&H Marsh & McLennan, the world's largest insurance brokerage, said both companies were "very solid."
Gloria Vogel, an insurance analyst at Advest Inc., a brokerage firm based in Hartford, agreed. But she said it would have been difficult for USF& G to survive on its own as competition increased.
"They just weren't efficient enough," she said. "They weren't bleeding. But over the long term they would have been forced to partner with somebody."
Ms. Vogel said that because St. Paul's expertise lies almost exclusively in commercial insurance, the hardest part of the consolidation might be the absorption of USF& G's business in life and home coverage.
The headquarters of the combined companies will be in St. Paul, where the St. Paul Companies are based. But the executives said that the merged company would continue to have significant operations in Baltimore, where USF& G is based.
The purchase price is based on an exchange ratio for USF& G's 111 million shares that could vary based on the price of St. Paul shares during a 20-day period leading up to a USF& G shareholder meeting at which the deal will be considered.
St. Paul agreed to pay about $22 each for USF& G's shares if St. Paul shares trade between $74 and $78 during that period. USF& G shares closed on Friday at $21.4375. St. Paul's roughly 91 million shares closed at $78.125 on Friday.
If St. Paul's stock rises above $78 during that period, USF& G shareholders will share in the increase, though the price will fall if St. Paul shares fall below $74. The deal is expected to close in midsummer.
Mr. Blake said he made the first overture toward St. Paul to initiate the merger. But Mr. Leatherdale said he had been looking for just such an opportunity.
"We think the combined company is going to have a very large presence in the industry," Mr. Leatherdale said.
St. Paul reported revenue of $4.3 billion last year, nearly all from commerical insurance. About 70 percent of USF& G's business is commercial. The rest is in such lines as insurance for automobiles and homes. Of the more than 1,000 companies selling property and casualty insurance in the United States, St. Paul has been ranked 15th and USF& G, 23d. Together, they will form the country's eighth-largest property and casualty insurer, with assets of more than $36 billion and estimated revenue from premiums of $7 billion.

HEADLINE: Congressional Fact-Finding in Saipan: They Came. They Saw. They Golfed.

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 19

 BODY:
At least five members of Congress and dozens of Congressional aides have traveled a grueling 9,000 miles, crossed nine time zones and endured serious jet lag, all in the name of diligent fact finding.
Their destination: Saipan, a volcanic island and capital of the Northern Marianas, a chain of 14 islands in the western Pacific that is a commonwealth of the United States. The islands, which are about 3,500 miles west of Hawaii, boast crystalline lagoons, balmy climes, championship golf courses and, for the free-market minded, relaxed wage and immigration rules. 
 The bills for the journeys, which can run as high as $5,500 for one person for one week, were paid by the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, which is trying hard to keep its exemption from Federal minimum wage and immigration laws.
"You have people coming here who, before they came on the trip, couldn't find Saipan on the map and have no direct responsibility over it, no history of involvement," said Representative George Miller of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Resources Committee who is a vocal critic of the commonwealth's low wages and labor policies. "It's just a pure and simple lobbying job."
For the past year and a half, the office of the commonwealth's Governor has conducted an ambitious public relations campaign, paying millions of dollars for fact-finding trips and in fees to Washington lobbyists, particularly the law firm of Preston, Gates, Ellis & Rouvelas Meeds.
What sets this lobbying strategy apart from others is the success that the Marianas government has had in convincing Congressional Republicans that Democrats are wrong in pushing a bill that would raise wages and curtail immigration there.
Over the New Year's holiday, Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the House majority whip who has been a staunch supporter of the commonwealth's policies, made the trip to Micronesia with his wife, his daughter and three aides. He stayed for five work-filled days but also found time to play two rounds of golf on a pristine seaside golf course. Upon his return, Mr. DeLay proclaimed the Democrats' legislation dead.
The government-paid trips, first reported by Roll Call, the Capitol Hill newspaper, have become especially popular in the last year, when the former Governor of the Northern Marianas, Froilan Tenorio, sensed a threat from the Clinton Administration to the islands' status quo. The Administration has described the laws as exploitative to workers.
Called to action, the Washington lobbyists hired by the commonwealth got to work. They extended invitations to nearly all members of Congress and their aides, as well as to officials of conservative research centers and newspaper editorial writers, to "educate" them about the Northern Marianas, said Jack Abramoff, the Preston, Gates lobbyist who arranged the trips. As many as 80 Congressional staff members, most of them Republicans who espouse free-market beliefs and dislike Democratic labor policies, have visited the island courtesy of the government.
"They don't have a Congressman or a delegate to the United States," Mr. Abramoff said. "It's the farthest territory from the United States. Nobody knew anything about it. And the Federal bureaucracy, which for so long had a paternalistic and almost colonialist rule over these guys, said let's make a move on their economy."
After World War I, Japan controlled Saipan and the Northern Marianas under a League of Nations mandate. Saipan, which was the site of a Japanese air base in World War II, was seized by United States forces in July 1944 after a three-week battle in which 3,400 Americans and 27,000 Japanese were killed. The island, 13 miles long and about 5 miles wide, then became a base for air attacks on the Japanese home islands.
Saipan and the other Northern Marianas voted to become a commonwealth in 1975. To help stimulate industry, the United States agreed to exempt it from Federal minimum wage and immigration laws.
Now Democrats say the exemption should be revoked. Most of the garment factories are not owned by American citizens. The workers hail mostly from China, Bangladesh and the Philippines, brought in for one or two years and paid $3.05 an hour, compared with $5.15 in the United States. So many workers have arrived -- 35,000 -- that they outnumber Saipan's permanent residents.
To the Democrats' chagrin, the clothing can be shipped to the United States with labels that say "Made in the U.S.A. With Imported Fabric," because Saipan is American soil. Earlier this week the bipartisan United States Commission on Immigration Reform deplored what it described as systematic labor and human-rights violations relating to the treatment of workers there.
But Congressional visitors on Government-paid trips return home with a rosier picture of the islands, said Allen Stayman, an Interior Department official and critic of commonwealth policies.
Saipan is "essentially being taken over by Asian garment interests who are exploiting it for their own greed," said Mr. Stayman.
At least five members of Congress have made government-paid trips to Saipan in the past year and a half, but the island's most illustrious Congressional visitor was Mr. DeLay, the Texas Republican, who came at the invitation of the former Governor, Mr. Tenorio. Mr. DeLay's trip was arranged by Mr. Abramoff, a friend who, along with his wife, contributed $4,000 to Mr. DeLay's 1998 re-election campaign.
To be sure, Mr. DeLay's official itinerary was chock full of meetings. He met with the former Governor and the new Governor, Pedro P. Tenorio, a relative of his predecessor. Mr. DeLay sat down with members of the legislature and with the Roman Catholic Bishop of Saipan, who touched on human rights.
But there was time for regaling and relaxing, too.
Mr. DeLay was honored and entertained every evening. One reception was given by a Hong Kong businessman, Willie Tan, who agreed in 1992 to pay $9 million in back wages for his companies' failure to pay garment workers overtime.
And Mr. DeLay, an avid golfer, twice played on one of Saipan's finest golf courses, the Lao Lao Bay Golf Resort. He and his family also visited Managaha Island, a 10-acre island in the lagoon that is known for its snorkeling.
When he returned to Washington, Mr. DeLay spoke glowingly of the commonwealth's economic policies and renewed his vow to block legislation that would tinker with its wage and immigration policies.
Mr. DeLay's press secretary, John P. Feehery, who accompanied him, said the Congressman wanted to see for himself whether Saipan's purported sweatshop conditions were as outrageous as the Democrats say.
" 'Tis the season to cry junket," Mr. Feehery said. "He would not travel 30 hours for some fun in the sun. That's not what he's about."
By and large, Republicans maintain that Mr. Stayman and other Democrats are simply doing the bidding of American labor unions. Saipan's policy, they say, has been fruitful and effective at making the islands increasingly self-sufficient.
It is an opinion they have honed during their visits to the Marianas.
Representative Phil English, Republican of Pennsylvania, just returned from his own trip to Saipan, where he represented Congressional Republicans at the new Governor's inauguration.
Other guests of the Marianas government have included Representatives Dana Rohrabacher, who later gave a complimentary speech about the commonwealth on the House floor, and Brian P. Bilbray, both California Republicans. Mr. Rohrabacher took his fiancee along, and Mr. Bilbray took his wife.
Because the commonwealth is the equivalent of a state government, the Congressmen did not have to disclose the trips in the same way as those paid for by private businesses. At least four Democrats have made the trip, but the Marianas government did not pay the expenses of three of them. Mr. Miller, who introduced legislation to change the wage and immigrations laws, visited the island this week. His expenses were paid for by taxpayers because he traveled on committee business.
The same will apply for Representative Don Young, the Alaska Republican who leads the Resources Committee, which has jurisdiction over the commonwealth, and 10 members of the panel, who plan to visit Saipan in February. But one of Mr. Young's aides took a trip there earlier this month, paid for by the commonwealth.
Some members of Congress are distancing themselves from the Pacific voyages.
"You can't make a decision here in Washington that affects the Northern Marianas with your head stuck in the sand," said Ken Johnson, press secretary for Representative W. J. (Billy) Tauzin, the Louisiana Republican who decided this week not to take the February trip.
"That said," Mr. Johnson continued, "there have been instances where staff members have been shielded from seeing and talking to people who would be able to shed some light on what is happening over there. You're only going to see what they want you to see."

HEADLINE: 3 Years After War, Ecuador and Peru Agree to Peace Talks

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Jan. 19

 BODY:
Ecuador and Peru, which went to war three years ago over a border dispute, signed an agreement here today creating a timetable that they said would lead to a peace treaty.
Four commissions are to be established to tackle the main areas of contention between the countries. One will deal with the most thorny issue: demarcation of the border. The other commissions will focus on matters including trade and navigation, security and confidence-building measures. 
 The accord was signed here in an atmosphere of friendliness that contrasted with the past belligerence between the two Andean countries.
Last year, after President Abdala Bucaram of Ecuador visited Peru, the Ecuadorean Congress debated charging him with treason. The visit was high on the list of sins cited when Mr. Bucaram was impeached soon after his return and removed from office. Congress chose Fabian Alarcon to replace him.
The brief war between Ecuador and Peru erupted in January 1995, around the anniversary of the Rio Protocol, a 1942 peace treaty in which Ecuador, defeated in battle, ceded half of its territory. Though it signed the treaty, Ecuador has never accepted its terms, and the maps that its schoolchildren are given show Ecuador's borders encroaching far into Peruvian territory.
Speaking before the signing, Foreign Minister Luiz Felipe Lampreia of Brazil pledged that a Treaty of Free Trade and Navigation, part of the 1942 pact, would finally be put into effect. It would guarantee Ecuador "unrestricted, free, continuous and perpetual" access to the Amazon Basin and the river's northern tributaries, Mr. Lampreia said.
Edgar Teran, the former Ecuadorean Ambassador to Washington who is the lead negotiator for his country, said he believed that today's agreement, which provides for geographers and legal experts on the commissions to weigh the border claims of each side, would lead to a "final solution of the problems between Ecuador and Peru."
His Peruvian counterpart, Fernando de Trazegnies, said, "It's important that we enter the 21st century with a 21st-century mentality," adding that the two countries faced the "common enemies" of underdevelopment and poverty.
The Rio Protocol set the border between Ecuador and Peru and laid out a host of other elements -- until now, largely ignored -- to promote trade and cooperation. The Rio Protocol named Brazil, the United States, Chile and Argentina as guarantor nations.
The guarantors now hope that economic and development incentives in the border region will give the two sides a common stake in promoting trade instead of border wrangles.
"It's an incredible turning point," said Luigi Einaudi, a retired United States ambassador who is heading the Washington delegation.
While neither Mr. de Trazegnies nor Mr. Teran would say what specifically led them to expect success in negotiations now, other diplomats close to the talks said several favorable elements had converged.
With Peru having recently purchased MiG-29 fighter jets and Sukhoi bombers, Ecuador and other countries feared that an arms buildup in Peru could lead to hostilities, a diplomat from one of the guarantor nations said. Some said they feared that President Alberto K. Fujimori of Peru might turn to a show of military strength to bolster his flagging popularity as presidential elections approach in 2000.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
2d Border Dispute Ends
 TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras, Jan. 19 (Reuters) -- Honduras and El Salvador today formally ended a long and bitter border dispute that once led the two nations into war, resolving vexing problems of nationality and property ownership for thousands of farmers in the mountainous territory.
The two countries agreed to mark 151.5 miles of border physically within a year. The other 80.6 miles are already marked.
The border dispute led to the so-called Soccer War of 1969, a 100-hour shooting war halted by the Organization of American States. Five thousand people died then, and periodic tension had arisen despite a 1980 peace treaty and a 1992 World Court ruling that tried to work out the differences.

HEADLINE: Franks Is Planning Race to Oppose Dodd for His Senate Seat

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Jan. 19

 BODY:
Gary A. Franks, a Connecticut Republican who lost his seat in the House of Representatives two years ago, is beginning a race for the Senate seat of Christopher J. Dodd, the three-term Democratic incumbent and former general chairman of the Democratic National Committee.
Mr. Franks is scheduled to make his formal announcement on Tuesday afternoon in his hometown of Waterbury, and he already has started to stake out staunchly conservative positions. In an interview this evening, the 44-year-old Mr. Franks said he supported a flat tax, a balanced-budget amendment, an end to racial preferences in affirmative action, and vouchers that would pay for children to attend parochial schools. 
 "I'm running for the U. S. Senate because I believe that Connecticut needs a representative in Washington committed to a limited Federal Government, lower taxes and economic prosperity," Mr. Franks said, asserting that the differences between him and Mr. Dodd were "vast." Mr. Franks said he had never voted for a tax increase while Mr. Dodd has voted for "countless number of tax hikes."
Mr. Franks's bid for the Senate is an attempt to recover the luster that he once had as a rising star in the Republican Party. He gained prominence in 1990, when he was the first black Republican elected to the House in nearly 50 years and quickly became a regular on the political talk-show circuit on issues relating to race.
But after three terms in Congress, Mr. Franks lost a run for re-election to James Maloney, 46 percent to 52 percent. Mr. Franks was sharply attacked by organized labor for initially opposing the minimum-wage increase and then defeated in the Clinton landslide.
The Senate race would appear to be an uphill contest for Mr. Franks. Mr. Dodd is popular in Connecticut and already has a sizable fund-raising lead. Marvin Fast, a spokesman for Mr. Dodd, said the Senator had raised more than $2 million by the last public filing date six months ago. Mr. Franks said today that he had raised about $500,000.
A poll released in December by The Hartford Courant and the University of Connecticut Institute for Social Inquiry showed that in a matchup between the two men, 55 percent preferred Mr. Dodd, to 20 percent for Mr. Franks. The poll of 500 randomly selected Connecticut residents has a margin of error of plus or minus five percentage points.
Today, Mr. Franks dismissed the poll, noting that his own survey showed a slightly smaller margin. "Obviously, I have a lot of work to do," he said, adding that he expected to receive strong Republican backing. He has already been endorsed by Gov. John G. Rowland, the state's top Republican, and it appears that he will face no challenge for the party's nomination.
Mr. Franks said many of the state's prominent politicians, including former Senator Abraham A. Ribicoff, Governor Rowland and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, had lost elections before staging triumphant campaigns for statewide office.
Mr. Fast, Mr. Dodd's spokesman, declined to comment on Mr. Franks's campaign. "There'll be a time and season for politics," he said, "but right now, Senator Dodd is focused on working for the people of Connecticut."

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW;
Just a Nonartist in the Art World, but Endlessly Seen and Cited

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
In the tradition of the painter's painter or the poet's poet, M. C. Escher is the nonartist's nonartist. The space-twisting, mind-bending images of this Dutch printmaker rank among the 20th century's most popular.
They have been widely disseminated through unlimited editions, posters, T-shirts and album covers and are regularly found in college dormitories, bookstores, computer labs and mathematicians' offices. Benoit B. Mandelbrot, the inventor of fractal geometry, has listed Escher's art among his inspirations. Douglas R. Hofstadter, the author of the best seller "Godel, Escher, Bach," discussed the different uses that the mathematician, artist and composer of the title made of elaborate structures and repetition. 
 Not surprisingly, the small, informative survey of 77 prints and drawings that the National Gallery has mounted on the centenary of Escher's birth (he died in 1972 at the age of 73) has been drawing large crowds, twice the average attendance for a show of this size.
But it hasn't caused a ripple in the worlds of art and art history, where Escher's work tends to be viewed, at best, as art for beginners, an esthetic first love, like the poetry of Khalil Gibran or Pachelbel's Canon, that is soon outgrown. It may even be news in those quarters that the National Gallery has the largest collection of Escher material outside the Netherlands. (How? In the 1970's, Cornelius V. S. Roosevelt, grandson of Theodore and an Escher devotee in the extreme, gave it 200 prints and drawings, which doubled its holdings in the artist's work, along with 24 scrapbooks on Escher's career and an archive of letters by, to and about Escher.)
The National Gallery show (through April 27) is full of Escherian thrills and conundrums conveyed with workmanlike virtuosity, usually in lithograph or woodcut: impossible architectural structures; staircases that go up and down at the same time; elaborate vistas with three or four vanishing points, and patterns of flat, interlocking animal forms that evolve into animate creatures and then revert to flat pattern. The show begins with early efforts like "Self-Portrait in a Chair," a slightly moody woodcut made in 1920, when he was 22, which shows the seated artist from a steeply pitched mouse-eye view. It culminates in "Metamorphosis III," a 23-foot-long color woodcut completed in 1968 that reviews the manipulations of form and pattern basic to Escher's vocabulary. In this work, these unfold in a procession of seamless transformations, as in a passage where a hexagonal grid mutates into an increasingly realistic honeycomb that releases a battalion of bees that flatten and merge with an approaching school of white fish before shape-shifting into black birds. Each transition triggers a little rush of excitement, the kind you get from a chord change in your favorite pop song.
As these two works attest, Escher started out in a place very different from where he ended up. His development had two phases -- from 1918 to 1937 and from 1937 to 1972 -- and is best described as a process of mind winning out over matter as he turned to abstraction and away from the real world.
Born in Leeuwarden, the Netherlands, in 1898, Escher backed into his life's work. As a child he drew incessantly and was an outstandingly poor student. Frustrated, his father, a hydraulic engineer, sent him to the School for Architecture and Decorative Art in Haarlem when he was 19 to study architecture. Those plans were thwarted within a few days of Escher's arrival when Samuel Jesserun de Mesquita, a teacher of graphic techniques, advised him to switch to the graphic arts.
Escher perfected his drawing and printmaking skills under the watchful eye of de Mesquita. They seem to have formed a close relationship. Escher kept a photograph of his teacher pinned to a cupboard in his studio for the rest of his life and remained in touch with him until early 1944, when de Mesquita and his family, Portuguese Jews, were deported from Haarlem and died in a German concentration camp.
De Mesquita had an unusually clear view of Escher's limitations, writing in an evaluation that "he is too tight, too literary-philosophical, a young man too lacking in caprice, too little an artist."
During the first 15 years of his career, Escher found his optical thrills in the real world, which he depicted from extreme angles or in uncanny reflections. In the manner of Durer and the artists he influenced (Jan van Eyck, for example), Escher depicted himself reflected in a convex mirror, as well as in mirrored spheres and vessels. "Still Life with Mirror," a striking merger of reality and illusion, shows the doors and stoops along one of Rome's cool, stony streets reflected in a dresser mirror, where it almost looks like a painting.
The reality that Escher seemed to love most was the landscape and architecture of Italy, where he lived from 1922 to 1935. (During this time he met and married a Swiss artist named Jetta Umiker and started a family.) He devoted much of his energy to capturing the precipitous slopes and precariously clustered towns of the Amalfi coast and the mountains of Abruzzi and Calabria, spending summers drawing and winters converting the drawings to prints.
Although they look generic, like illustrations for a travel book, these landscapes are also extremely appealing, suffused with a sense of unhurried pleasure and rendered with meticulous care. (One of Escher's stacked-up towns depicted in red and white, crops up near the end of "Metamorphosis III," where it changes into a stack of isometric cubes.)
 
Making a Transition To the Impossible
 In addition to showing Escher at his best (least tight, most capricious), the Italian landscapes may also have helped trigger his second phase. Looking at some of them, it's easy to imagine that Escher studied the spatial complexities of pinnacled town and vertiginous country with such concentration that his eyes started playing tricks -- tricks that later sharpened into his impossible architecture.
In a lithograph of the coastal town of Corte, for example, the road leading up to the charming jumble of houses, streets and churches makes a hairpin turn; it's difficult to tell which side of the turn slants upward, which downward. This effect is far more extreme in late works like "Relativity" of 1953, with its up-down staircases and shifting orientations. A similar transition from real to artificial is indicated in "Still Life and Street," a brilliant woodcut from 1937 in which a windowsill merges with the street below so that a covered bowl on the sill suddenly appears to be monumental, the size of a fountain. (The image's tight regiments of parallel lines may remind some viewers of Sol LeWitt's wall drawings.)
Two other experiences contributed to Escher's withdrawal into increasingly fictive, confounding mindscapes. One was largely positive: in the early 1920's and again in 1936, he visited the Alhambra, where he studied and drew the pulsating patterns of the Islamic tilework and became fascinated with "the regular division of a plane," as he called it, a principle that would determine much of his later work. The other was not positive at all: in 1935, uneasy with the Fascist Government of Mussolini, Escher took leave of his beloved Italy with its inspiring landscape and soothing climate. For two years he and his family lived in Switzerland, which he quickly came to hate for its "horrible white misery of snow," then moved to Belgium and, finally, in 1941, to the Netherlands.
The work from his second phase may express a more distinct, individual vision, but of what? Some images cleverly illustrate geometric or spatial puzzles, like "The "Waterfall," where a medieval viaduct has three levels in which the water flows from one to the next in a continuous circuit. (It is based on the visual trick known as the tribar, a three-sided form whose corners appear to be right angles, which was published in 1958 by the physicist Roger Penrose.) Less illusionistic are the regularly divided planes or periodic images: the teasing patterns of interlocking elements that first seem to be abstract, but are actually cleverly nested living creatures that repeat in contrasting colors.
Occasionally human but usually animal, these creatures include fish, birds, flying fish, horses, gorgons and lizards. When organized on a grid, the interlocking images ceaselessly alternate between positive and negative, foreground and background; when spiraling, as in the many works using head-to-tail fish, the repeating, diminishing forms create a dizzying recession.
The momentary dazzle of Escher's mature works can give you a sharper understanding of how the eye and mind connect and conflict, sometimes at the same time, in the act of visual perception. But the effect is more Czerny than Bach, a mechanical knowledge stemming from perceptual exercises.
The viewer is presented with little more than a reasonable facsimile of the art experience, one that is challenging without being demanding, magical without being genuinely mysterious, that tickles the mind without genuinely stirring the emotions.
Escher's originality pertains largely to science and mathematics. Working intuitively and empirically, he was able to create computerlike complexities without computers and arrive at designs that illustrated mathematical principles that he often did not know about and said he could not understand when they were explained.
Esthetically, he was regressive with a vengeance, much in the way that Andrew Wyeth is, and his personality seems similarly isolated, disdainful of the art of his time and smugly modest. While Escher sometimes said that he saw himself less as an artist than as an artisan or graphic artist, he also said that while other artists pursued beauty in their work, his goal was "to awaken wonder in the minds of my viewers."
 
Moving Inward To an Ugly World
 Even Escher's intellectual originality came at a price: loss of connection with life in its imperfect, worldly form. His work not only moves inward in terms of its emphasis on abstract principles, it moves inward emotionally too, to a dark, sealed-off sphere that is perfectly ordered but also grimly joyless, sometimes ugly and, when the human figure is involved, clearly misanthropic.
Basically, all of Escher's humans are clones, identical anonymous characters moving in regimentation through space or across surfaces. Even when dressed as medieval peasants, as in the marching figures of "Belvedere," they suggest androids. Elsewhere they are elves or gnomes, most disturbingly in "Encounter," where an interlocking pattern of skulking white and black men (the latter with beaks that are a design solution, but nasty nonetheless) breaks apart and the figures circle in opposite directions, as if enacting a ritual dance.
Looking at these conforming, carefully controlled figures, one wonders if Fascism, which Escher detested, hadn't also contaminated his art, inadvertently becoming a subject buried deep beneath the surface but sometimes breaking through it.

Architecture Doesn't Stop At 96th Street

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ 

 BODY:
THE chorus girls on Broadway stood still as statues, but they made Michael Adams's eyes dance. He craned his neck to behold the slender, bare-chested figures that flanked the windows on the old Hamilton Theater on West 146th Street.
"They look like burlesque queens from Ziegfeld's Follies," Mr. Adams said. "Incredible. On the front of the building the keystones over the windows have comedic masks. It always struck me how in these vaudeville houses they decided there would never be any tragedy, so they just put up the mask of comedy." 
 Tragedy, it turns out, wears a dust mask. Work crews were converting the lobby of this once-grand vaudeville house and movie theater in Hamilton Heights into a department store. The walls had been stripped down to the brick, where white outlines were a ghostly reminder of mirrored arches. One man sorted through a pile of clothing scattered among the plaster and paint chips, ignoring the chipped cherub that hovered above on a frieze.
This raises complicated questions for Mr. Adams, a preservationist and architectural historian devoted to protecting Harlem's physical riches. An active business beats an empty, gated storefront in an area that needs more investment. But why is there no corresponding investment in protecting and landmarking the elegant structures that graced these neighborhoods, some of which have been covered with gaudy siding or slathered with stucco?
While well-organized advocates rally elsewhere in the city to protect their treasures, Mr. Adams said that only 7.5 percent of Manhattan's landmarked buildings are above 96th Street.
"We're not against economic development, but why is it necessary to destroy something irreplaceable?" Mr. Adams asked. "In SoHo or TriBeCa, those features are used to attract people. Here, it's thrown in the Dumpster like it's trash."
Or scavenged and sold to those downtown stores that recycle bits of buildings in exchange for chunks of your wallet. On 149th Street, Mr. Adams pointed to the half-peeled copper dome of a synagogue that had been turned into a Christian church. Hammered-copper lions' heads once graced the dome, but they were swiped ages ago. On the facade, cinder blocks covered what had once been windows.
"I was looking at a book on urban artifacts and there was no mention of Harlem in the index," Mr. Adams said. "But in caption after caption, you see fireplace mantels or doorways that used to be in Harlem."
It was enough to drive him to seek the esthetic haven of Ann Dobson's apartment. She has lived since 1956 in a stately building on Riverside Drive and 150th Street that had once been home to Marian Anderson and Ralph Ellison. Ms. Dobson's nine-room apartment features leaded windows with stained-glass details, impeccable floors and sweeping river views.
HE and Ms. Dobson, a friend, commiserated over the demise of the Hamilton Theater, which she used to visit for first-run movies. That era seemed distant, a reminder of the time when apartments like hers were common, before landlords cut them up to house the thousands of immigrants that settled into upper Manhattan. Now she sometimes feels it's too painful to walk down Broadway and confront the memories stirred by aging or covered-up facades. She takes some comfort in the efforts of Mr. Adams and some of her longtime neighbors.
"This is part of our history," she said. "When I go to other cities in Europe, I see all these places that are 500 years old being used, still being viable. We won't have anything in this city over 100 years old if we keep on tearing it down."
Mr. Adams said he hoped to prod city officials into protecting the interior of the Hamilton Theater, which has already survived years of use as a soda and beer warehouse. He is also pushing to extend the boundaries of the Hamilton Heights Historic District, among other concerns.
He knows that a lot of the new arrivals in the uptown neighborhoods may be more preoccupied with paying the rent than preserving worn-out architectural details, but he is optimistic that proposed Federal legislation offering tax credits for landmarked buildings may help some banks and investors become involved.
He insists that Harlem's past doesn't have to vanish with present progress.
"So many different groups of people have seen this area as the destination of their dreams," he said. "You have this rich cultural and architectural heritage, like the synagogue that is now a church. This layering of culture on top of culture is like an illustration of what America is about."

Bonds Fail to Hold Gains on More Signs of Asian Stability

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices surrendered early gains to finish lower yesterday.
Stability on many Asian markets as well as a rally in stocks weighed down the bond market. Bonds were also dragged down by the expected sale of a $1.4 billion bond issue by Israel, which drew money away from Treasury securities, as well as word of large selling by a hedge fund. 
 The price of the 30-year bond dropped about 15/16, to 104 2/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction to its price, rose to 5.84 percent, from 5.80 percent on Friday -- the highest since 5.92 percent on Dec. 31. The Treasury market was closed on Monday for Martin Luther King Jr. Day.
Traders said the market received a fleeting lift from comments by the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, Edward G. Boehne. Speaking before the Main Line Chamber of Commerce in Berwyn, Pa. Mr. Boehne said the risk of deflation was not particularly significant and that he expected inflation to remain around 2 percent.
Traders said the supply of corporate debt coming to market by issuers taking advantage of low interest rates hurt the longer maturities yesterday, particularly as it came on light trading volume. GovPx, a bond pricing service, said trading was about 10 percent lighter than an average Tuesday in the first quarter last year.
The debt offering by Israel will be priced today through Lehman Brothers. The offering has a face amount of $3 billion with proceeds expected to total $1.4 billion. Traders say the maturities will run from 2002 to 2027.
At yesterday's regular weekly Treasury bill auction the outcome was in line with expectations. The average rate for a three-month bill was 4.980 percent, up from 4.965 percent the previous week. The average rate for the six-month bill was 4.995 percent, up from 4.910 percent.
The Treasury market continues to feel the impact of events in Asia. The turmoil in many countries is expected to help slow economic growth in the United States and may prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. At the same time, the turmoil is driving foreign investors into the relative safety of United States securities.
"It's getting a little old to keep talking about the Asian crisis and its impact on U.S. Treasuries, but that's the story we're stuck with for the foreseeable future," said Dave Shabelman, a Treasury market analyst with Standard & Poor's MMS, a market research and analysis firm in San Francisco.
Following are the results of yesterday's weekly Treasury auction of new three-month and six-month bills:

During the early part of this decade, Lawrence H. Feldman, chairman of what was then called Feldman Equities, was anguishing over missed opportunities. He could see that there were Manhattan buildings that could benefit from his upgrading formula available at attractive prices.
But nobody was eager to finance a purchase in a market where vacancies were increasing and rents were falling. 
 "In the early 90's we were frustrated because we couldn't buy the assets we wanted," Mr. Feldman said at a recent real estate conference at Baruch College.
Today, access to capital is much less of a problem. Mr. Feldman is chairman of Tower Realty Trust, which sold more than $350 million in shares to the public last October and has a $200 million line of credit from Merrill Lynch & Company to go shopping with.
Tower is a real estate investment trust, a tax-sheltered company that invests in and holds real estate. REIT's (pronounced REETS) have been a major factor in national real estate markets for most of the 90's, acquiring tens of billions of dollars of assets like suburban shopping centers, office buildings and residential structures.
But until last year, they had been largely absent in New York, which industry executives say was due in part to a state capital gains tax that has since been eliminated and to the sheer size of the properties in Manhattan. Because Manhattan skyscrapers sell for scores or even hundreds of millions of dollars, such an investment would have represented too large a portion of a REIT's assets. But now that some REIT's have grown so large, even a Manhattan building is a relatively small part of its portfolio.
That changed last year. Vornado Realty Trust of Saddle Brook, N.J., acquired many of the properties owned by the Mendik Company and went on a buying spree that included the $420 million 1 Penn Plaza building, which occupies the block bounded by Seventh and Eighth Avenues and 34th and 33d Streets.
In addition, another Manhattan-oriented company, S. L. Green Real Estate, formed a REIT and sold shares, as did Boston Properties, which is controlled by Mortimer Zuckerman. Financial experts say they expect the trend to continue, with privately held real estate increasingly transferred to public ownership. Still, REIT's are a small factor in the city, with Mr. Feldman estimating that they own no more than 45 of the about 1,200 major commercial buildings in New York.
"There are great opportunities in Manhattan office properties," W. Blake Baird of the investment firm of Morgan Stanley said. "We are going to see the recapitalization of assets in New York City and Manhattan. It will be a major change."
Mr. Feldman said his new status would not change the company, other than to give it a greater ability to move quickly when opportunity knocks. "We are real estate developers," he said. "We buy distressed properties and upgrade them." He said that with the national economy strong and most real estate values recovered from the lows of the early 90's, the last bargains are in the concentrated office canyons known as central business districts, like midtown and downtown Manhattan.
Central business districts, he said, are "the last recovery zone." In New York, he added, "downtown is the last place you can buy below replacement costs."
Steven L. Green, the chairman of S. L. Green, said the REIT structure should be more stable and better for tenants than private ownership. "If you have 85 to 90 percent debt, you don't have the money to make improvements and do other things to make tenants happy when the market goes down," he said. As a result of its public offering, he said , his company has only 12 percent debt and is not inclined to go above 30 percent, leaving a substantial cushion to the downturn that history suggests is inevitable sometime in the future.
"Tenants are better off in REIT-owned buildings," Mr. Green said. "Brokers will put tenants in buildings with stable ownership," he said, because tenants typically blame their brokers if problems occur with a new landlord.
Not everyone holds this view. Anthony Downs, a real estate specialist and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, contends that because managers of publicly owned REIT's want to continuously improve earnings and dividend payouts, they have an incentive to reduce or defer capital spending. "Over time, this could reduce the quality of the nation's inventory of commercial properties if a large fraction of them become owned by public REIT's," he wrote in the current issue of Wharton Real Estate Review.
Nevertheless, David Csontos, a managing director of Insignia Capital Advisers, said REIT's were inherently more stable than private companies because it costs them less to borrow money. Insignia is an affiliate of Insignia Financial Group, which also owns the Edward S. Gordon brokerage and management company in New York.
Mr. Csontos said REIT's could borrow for as much as 3 percentage points less than a private developer or owner, giving them a powerful advantage. But, he said, private companies, which do not have the burden of the detailed reporting requirements of a public company, will probably continue to develop new properties. "At the end of the day, the world will probably be divided into developers and landlords, with the REIT's as landlords," he said.
One of the powerful attractions of the REIT form of ownership is that it offers partnerships that own portfolios of property -- partnerships that are typically owned by families, some of whose members have reached retirement age -- a means of shifting to a more liquid form of ownership, without having to pay capital gains taxes. Scott Rechler, president of Reckson Associates Realty Corporation, said becoming a real estate investment trust enabled the company to liquidate partnerships established by his grandfather more than 40 years ago.

HEADLINE: Princeton Will Liberalize Its Financial-Aid Formulas

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER 

 BODY:
In a step indicative of the competition among top universities for middle- and lower-income students, Princeton University is liberalizing its financial aid policies, changing many loans to outright grants and altering its formula for calculating a family's ability to pay college bills.
The plan, expected to be approved by the board of trustees on Saturday, eliminates loans for students whose families earn less than $40,000 a year, turning them into grants. It also increases the share of grants over loans to students from families earning $40,000 to $57,500. 
 Jeremiah P. Ostriker, Princeton's provost, said this change would benefit some 115 to 170 students, or about 10 to 15 percent of the next incoming class.
An additional measure, which is engendering much comment, is a plan to stop including home equity in calculating the assets of families earning less than $90,000 a year. For families earning more than that but still qualifying for some financial aid, one-half or one-quarter of home equity will be considered among their assets. Mr. Ostriker said 30 to 35 percent of the incoming class would benefit from that measure.
Princeton officials say the plan will ultimately cost the university some $6 million a year after being fully phased in over the next four years. The college faces growing competition for middle-class students from state universities whose tuition, room and board costs are substantially below those of Princeton.
Jesse Cheng, 21, a senior from San Marino, Calif., said: "When I was choosing whether or not to come to Princeton, the decision was between here and a state school. If Princeton had cost as much as a state school, there would have been no need to debate in my mind whether I should go or not."
The cost of tuition, room and board next fall at Princeton is expected to be $30,531, rising above $30,000 for the first time.
Under the new plan, a student from a family earning $50,000 a year with savings of $15,000 and home equity of $60,000 would benefit from an increase in grant aid of $1,500 a year, according to university calculations.
A student from a family earning $85,000 annually with savings of $40,000 and home equity of $110,000 would gain an additional $2,700 a year, the calculations showed.
The cost of higher education has been a growing topic of concern nationally as tuition increases have far outstripped inflation and average family income.
"The interesting question is whether there will be a cascading effect from this," said Michael S. McPherson, president of Macalester College in St. Paul, Minn., an economist who has frequently written on the cost of higher education. "Very few schools have the resources of Princeton, so their responses are likely to be more targeted and limited than Princeton's."
Other educational economists agreed, saying Princeton's plan might affect its direct competitors in the Ivy League but not many others.
B. Jay Cooper, director of public relations at Yale University, said that he was sure other schools would look at the Princeton plan for competitive reasons but that its impact was still unclear.
Some economists raised questions about the home equity portion of the plan, saying it was politically appealing but economically dubious to remove it from asset calculations.
"Any economist will tell you that an asset is an asset is an asset," said Hal F. Higginbotham, vice president for student assistance services at the College Board. "Home equity is a very emotional and politically charged asset, however, because America's favorite way to save has been home equity."
Princeton officials said that 43 percent of their approximately 4,600 students received financial aid and that the median income of such recipients' families was $70,000.
Justin Mulaire, a 21-year-old senior mathematics major from Stamford, Conn., and a member of the student-faculty committee that created the new plan, said that the university was likely to run a budget deficit in the short term partly because of this program but that the decision to go ahead with it was evidence of the commitment to student aid.

HEADLINE: Rising Fear of Lawsuits Is Threatening Programs of Study Abroad

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
In the aftermath of the rapes of five American college students in Guatemala last Friday, proponents of study-abroad programs in countries of Latin America and the Middle East, where there have long been safety warnings, now have a new enemy: lawsuits.
There is a growing movement to hold universities liable for the safety of their students studying overseas. At risk may be the popular courses themselves. 
 "We are afraid programs that are extremely thoughtful and quite safe won't be supported by institutions because they're afraid of the threat of lawsuits," said Len Clark, provost of Earlham College in Richmond, Ind.
The fears arise as more American students study in increasingly diverse destinations. Two-thirds of the 89,000 students who study overseas still go to Western Europe, according to the Institute of International Education, which is based in New York. But the number of students who went to Latin America in 1996 increased 18 percent over the previous year. In Africa, the increase was 10 percent, and in Asia it was 5 percent.
The issue of liability has become a big concern as students travel to riskier destinations. Mary Davidson, assistant director of the United States office of the American University in Cairo, said that when 58 foreigners were killed in Luxor, Egypt, last November, many American colleges that send students to the American University canceled.
"Was that responsible behavior?" Ms. Davidson asked. "I think many acted on the advice of their institution's legal counsel. Was it responsible in terms of the educational goals of the students and faculty? I'd debate that."
In the latest withdrawal, Spring Arbor College in Michigan announced yesterday that a group of 16 students and 2 faculty members was being brought home early from Guatemala as a result of the attack there. The students had decided to stay, but the college president overruled them.
Separate lawsuits against two American programs are being closely watched as they go to trial this year. In one, an Earlham student who says she was raped in April 1996 by her host father in Tokyo is suing the college for $3 million. In the other, the families of four students killed in a bus crash in India in March 1996 are suing the Semester at Sea program for an undisclosed amount.
Courts have already said colleges and universities are legally responsible for some injuries that befall students on campus. But whether that applies overseas, and to what sorts of injuries, has not been decided.
"In many cases people didn't think there was liability involved, or they didn't want to go after a university -- it's not your traditional target of lawsuits," said Robert Aalberts, a professor of legal studies at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas. "I think they were living on borrowed time until big things happened, and now they have."
For Michael Conn, a 19-year-old sophomore at Brandeis University, safety still means Western Europe. Mr. Conn plans to go to France, not Africa, next year because he believes it is the safest place to study French.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
G.M. is poking around Asia looking for good deals or alliances with beaten-down auto makers.

BYLINE: By Robyn Meredith 

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
GENERAL MOTORS is kicking the tires of auto companies in Asia.
Fire-sale prices from the crash of Asian currencies along with eased trade restrictions are rekindling a long-running desire by American auto companies to capture more of the Asian market. 
"This may be the global garage sale of a lifetime," said Joseph S. Phillippi, an auto analyst at Lehman Brothers.
G.M. has been the most aggressive of the American auto makers. It has been talking with two large Korean auto makers, the Daewoo Motor Corporation and Kia Motors, along with other auto or auto parts makers about a variety of options, said Michael G. Meyerand, a G.E. spokesman.
"We're clearly getting more aggressive on it because there's more opportunity," said Donald T. Sullivan, president of G.M.'s Asian and Pacific operations. "We're looking at selectively possibly taking pieces" in East Asian auto makers, he said.
To a lesser extent, the Ford Motor Company has been exploring deals in Asia. "We've been there," said John M. Devine, Ford's chief financial officer. "We're watching everything."
The Chrysler Corporation has remained on the sidelines so far, focusing instead on expansion in South America. "We're a little more cautious than our competition" about the opportunities in Asia, said Thomas T. Stallkamp, Chrysler's president.
Long before the current economic troubles, G.M. and Ford each developed a strategy to capture 10 percent of the Asia-Pacific market during the next decade. Only a year ago, those goals looked wildly optimistic.
But instead of starting from scratch with new factories, the auto companies now have an opportunity to catch up quickly with the Japanese in these markets by buying Asian auto makers or forming strategic alliances with local manufacturers.
Asian auto or auto parts makers were not interested in such combinations just a short time ago. But now some are bankrupt, many are short of cash and most are increasingly worried about their home markets as consumers shun showrooms. In dollar terms, these companies look relatively cheap to Americans after the plunge in local currencies.
Besides, American auto companies have been hoarding cash to withstand the next recession in the United States. Any of the Big Three could spend up to several billion dollars and still barely thin bulging wallets, Wall Street analysts said. At the end of the third quarter, G.M. had $14.6 billion in cash and marketable securities, while Ford had $19.3 billion and the Chrysler Corporation had $7.6 billion.
Indeed, the Asian slowdown could be a blessing for the big American auto makers. As they began building factories in the region in the last few years, analysts became increasingly worried about overcapacity, pointing to the Asian companies that were racing to build assembly lines. Kia and Hyundai, which now face dwindling demand for cars at home, have been able to sell their cars at a heavy discount in the United States because of the declining value of the Korean currency -- a Hyundai Accent sells for $8,500 in the United States, far below the price of a Ford Escort.
By buying into these Asian auto makers, the Big Three could stem production and prevent them from depressing prices worldwide. "What you basically should do if you're G.M. or Ford is you buy a plant and then you blow it up just to make a statement about all the excess capacity there," Mr. Phillippi said.
Several obstacles remain, however, for American auto makers. The region remains in financial chaos, which could lead to political instability. In addition, the potential takeover targets are generally awash in debt.
The Big Three companies are expected to resist acquiring big liabilities. That means that before any deals can be struck, the banks that lent to troubled Asian auto makers will probably have to swallow hard and write down the debt.
And sorting out various ownership rights in Asian companies is complex. "We have to look at can you even extract something from the mess that's already over there -- especially in Korea with the conglomerates," Mr. Stallkamp said.
Furthermore, in the short term, the American auto makers might not fare much better than the Asian auto makers struggling to move cars out of their showrooms. G.M. and Ford may scale back their factory plans for Thailand this year, and Chrysler has lowered its sales projections for Asia.
"If you want to be successful in Asia, you'd better be prepared to be there for the long term," Mr. Sullivan of G.M. said.
Rather than buy Asian companies outright, G.M. may forge partnerships. "You don't have to own everything or have 99 percent control of everything to take advantage of it," Mr. Sullivan said.
Ford already has a stake in Kia, the troubled Korean auto maker, but has not considered taking it over, said Alexander J. Trotman, Ford's chairman and chief executive. "We haven't been deeply involved in how Kia is restructured," he said. "Our interest really is to protect our 9.5 percent share." Ford also owns 33 percent of Mazda, which holds 7.5 percent more of Kia.
In the last few years, Chrysler has held back in Asia because of the difficulties of doing business in countries with heavy restrictions on imports and other policies that favor local auto makers.
But the International Monetary Fund has recently made some progress in persuading Asian leaders to drop protectionist policies. As part of its bailout package, South Korea agreed to drop certain trade barriers. And after months of resistance, President Suharto of Indonesia agreed as part of a far-reaching deal with the I.M.F. to drop tax breaks for a national car program run by his son.
G.M. responded on Friday by saying that it would make new investments in Indonesia. Earlier this month, G.M. bought out the 40 percent stake owned by President Suharto's half-brother, Bapak Probosutedjo, in General Motors Buana Indonesia, which builds Blazer sport utility vehicles there. "The purchase reflects G.M.'s commitment to Indonesia and its confidence in the long-term prospects of the automotive industry here," G.M. said in a statement.

HEADLINE: Pope vs. Embargo: Still a Sharp Divide in U.S.

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 20

 BODY:
Pope John Paul II will soon add his voice to a growing chorus calling for an end to the United States' economic embargo against Cuba. But the debate that he will be joining is an old one, and opinions in the White House and Congress are deeply entrenched.
After arriving in Cuba on Wednesday, the Pope is expected to denounce the 37-year-old embargo, as he has denounced embargoes in the past. When he does, he will join what one ardently anti-Castro member of Congress, Representatove Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Florida Republican, calls an "unholy alliance": 600 business groups and 140 religious and human-rights organizations asking the Clinton Administration to ease up on the sanctions. 
 The embargo's opponents -- strange bedfellows including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Council of Churches, the National Association of Manufacturers and the American Friends Services Committee -- say the embargo has starved the Cuban people of food and ideas, but failed to change President Fidel Castro.
"Economic embargoes don't work, period," said John Howard, director of international policy and programs at the Chamber of Commerce. "We believe the best way to open up the Cuban regime is to open it up to the American system."
They hope that the papal visit may compel American political leaders to think again about isolating Cuba.
"This is a landmark event," said Representative Lee H. Hamilton of Indiana, the ranking Democrat on the House International Relations Committee. "It's got an awful lot of people thinking. The Pope's approach is the exact opposite of the American Government's. The Pope is trying to engage the Cuban people. The U.S. policy is to isolate the Cuban people. The contrast is apparent.
"The real national interest to the United States is to see a peaceful transition after Castro," Mr. Hamilton said. "And the question is whether the embargo contributes to that or not."
Ever since the Cuban revolution in 1959, the White House has used many means -- including failed coups and assassination plots in the early 1960's -- to topple Mr. Castro. The embargo remains Washington's most powerful weapon "to bring pressure to bear on Cuba to change its form of government," in the words of the White House spokesman, Michael D. McCurry.
Jose Cardenas, Washington director of the Cuban-American National Foundation, a prominent anti-Castro group, described the embargo as "the primary nonviolent policy option for influencing change in Cuba."
So far, nothing suggests that Washington would sheath that weapon.
The Administration says "fundamental change" must come to Cuba before the embargo ends; no such change is in sight. Mr. McCurry said today that the White House would be watching "the aftermath of the trip and the policies pursued by the Government of Cuba, which would be the serious criteria that one could use to evaluate prospects for change in Cuba."
In Congress, Castro's many opponents have shaped the Administration's Cuban policies. Republican leaders and many Democrats, especially those representing communities of Cuban exiles in Florida and New Jersey, are committed to the embargo and unwilling to compromise. They have blocked a bill that would allow Cuba to buy American food and medicine, embargoed in 1992. They say American policy will change only when Cuba's politics do.
"The Pope's visit won't have any effect" on American policy, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen said. "The Pope's visit won't result in any more support for legislation to do away with the embargo. The greedy businessmen, the Chamber of Commerce, won't do away with the embargo. The real embargo is the embargo Castro has on people's freedom."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Possible Merger of Drug Makers Causes Late Stock Rally

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
For Wall Street, bigger seems to be better.
The possible merger of two pharmaceutical companies, which would be the largest corporate coupling ever, caused a late rally in stocks yesterday. 
 Word of the merger talks, between SmithKline Beecham and American Home Products, lifted the stocks of many drug companies as investors took the discussions as a sign that the industry might consolidate further.
The American Stock Exchange's 15-company pharmaceutical index rose 5.1 percent yesterday. The index is up 8.8 percent this year, making it one of the year's best-performing stock indexes.
The news also fueled a larger rally, which pushed the Dow Jones industrial average up almost 120 points as broader market indexes also gained more than 1 percent.
If SmithKline Beecham was to buy American Home Products, the deal would surpass the largest corporate combination to date, Worldcom's planned $37 billion purchase of MCI Communications, and would create one of the world's largest health care companies.
"It underscores that there's still financial deals to be done," said Andrew Brooks, a vice president in charge of equity trading at T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore.
American Home Products' stock, which closed at 94 1/4, is trading at the lofty level of about 28 times estimated 1997 earnings. At such a price, "if it's a value to the people who run these companies, then there's value for shareholders," said Steven Goldman, chief market strategist at Weeden & Company, in Greenwich, Conn., explaining why investors pushed up the stock 13 9/16 points.
Gathering steam from the drug stock rally, broad market indexes sailed higher. In its initial day of trading after the stock market's first observance of the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.5 percent, or 119.57 points, to 7,873.12. Last week the blue-chip index rose 173 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 stock index gained 17.09 points, or 1.8 percent, to 978.60 yesterday. And the Nasdaq composite index rose 1.7 percent, to 1,590.14, a 27.26-point gain.
Calmer markets in Asia provided a favorable backdrop for the market's surge. After posting strong gains on Monday, equity markets in Indonesia, Hong Kong, South Korea and Japan were modestly higher.
The lack of any new financial routs from that region, as well as a round of strong fourth-quarter earnings reports from American companies, heartened investors and sent buyers back into the market yesterday afternoon, analysts said.
The telephone equipment maker Lucent Technologies and the investment bank Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, as well as Continental, Northwest and America West airlines, all reported earnings that topped analysts' expectations, while companies like Lockheed Martin, Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer and Paine Webber Group posted earnings in line with forecasts.
But some financial services companies -- including Merrill Lynch and multinational banks like Citibank, J. P. Morgan and Chase Manhattan -- took a hit as Asia's market turmoil cut into earnings. Such earnings reports reminded investors that Asia's woes could still affect the future earnings of American companies, some analysts said.
"The full impact of the events in Southeast Asia has not hit some of these companies," said Robert Freedman, chief investment officer at John Hancock Funds in Boston.
"The worst of the crisis has not fully been realized," he said, adding that he still expected investment banks and multinational banks, as well as some technology concerns, to see earnings crimped because of the Asian crisis.
Mr. Freedman anticipates that retail stocks, health care and some technology issues, as well as regional United States banks, will do well because of their limited exposure to the Southeast Asian economy. However, banks with a big international presence may continue to suffer.
In December, analysts' forecasts of fourth-quarter earnings growth for the companies in the S.& P. 500 index fell from more than 13 percent to about 8 percent, Thomas Galvin, chief equity strategist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, told investors in a recent market comment. However, forecasts for the first quarter and all of 1998 are still too high, he said.

HEADLINE: Business Travel;
With corporate hotel rates on the rise, the search is on for good rooms that don't break budgets.

BYLINE: By Paul Burnham Finney 

 BODY:
WITH American Express estimating that corporate hotel rates will escalate around 15 percent this year, business travelers are trolling for good budget hotel rooms -- and finding them aplenty.
"Brand new economy hotels are going up every day," said Randy Smith, president of Smith Travel Research, a hotel consulting firm. "Some major companies are asking their travelers to downgrade to brands like Hampton, Fairfield and Comfort Inns and the newer Wingate Inns and Sleep Inns. That's where you can get the best value for your money -- at around $45 a night or sometimes as low as $30. The chains are providing some of the amenities -- TV's, dual phones, coffee makers -- you used to find only in midpriced hotels." 
 The hotel market niche that is making the biggest economy-size waves these days is for longer-term guests, such as employees in training programs, engineering projects and corporate relocations.
Among the classiest of the longer-stay hotels are Marriott International's Residence Inns. But the fastest-growing chain of this newer breed -- with a plain vanilla name -- is Extended Stay America Inc., which was started by the entrepreneur H. Wayne Huizenga, the chairman of Republic Industries, who is building a nationwide network of auto sales outlets and whose holdings include Alamo Rent-A-Car and National Car Rental. At $4 to $5 million each, plus last April's acquisition of Studio Plus Hotels, he has peppered 35 states coast to coast with some 200 hotels in just three years.
All the rooms have a queen-size bed, recliner chair, a computer port, free local calls and voice mail, remote TV, fax delivery, a coffee maker and a tiny kitchen with a stove top, microwave and refrigerator.
Rates range from about $300 to $400 a week at the Studio Plus Hotels to around $200 to $300 at Extended Stay America efficiency studios. Any of those numbers would cover roughly one night at many luxury hotels.
"Some 85 percent of the guests are business travelers," said a spokeswoman, Mariesa Capelli.
The nice twist for those on a tight budget is that many of these longer-stay chains are just as available for single nights as they are for longer periods. For example, the Monday through Friday rates at Extended Stay America in Akron, Ohio, are $44 daily and $209 weekly; in Torrance, Calif., $59 daily and $289 weekly.
But staffing is almost nil. "There's just a front desk, limited maid service and less turnover," Mr. Smith said. "That's where longer-stay hotels save on costs. There's no interaction with guests a lot of the time -- but then many travelers don't need that."
 
Super Bowl Entertaining
If you're bracketing this week's Super Bowl Sunday with some business entertaining in San Diego before and after the game, here are some first-rate restaurant candidates: the clubby Grant Grill in the landmark U.S. Grant Hotel; the Celadon for Thai food in a pretty setting; the opulent Le Fontainebleau, with a Continental menu, in the Westgate Hotel; the formal Top of the Market upstairs and casual Fish Market downstairs on North Harbor Drive for seafood and bay views; the cheerful Cafe Pacifica, also featuring fish, in a mission-style house in the Old Town section, and, nearby, the Old Town Mexican for margaritas and mariachi bands.
Across the Bay Bridge are two dining standouts at water's edge: Marius, with a Provence-inspired chef, in the Coronado Island Marriott and the Azzura Point, specializing in Pacific Rim dishes, in the Loews Coronado Bay Resort.
Up the coast, close to the corporate area called Silicon Beach, are several popular hotel restaurants: the Whaling Bar and Sky Room in La Jolla's venerable La Valencia Hotel; the sleek Cafe Japengo, highly rated by Zagat's survey participants, next to the Hyatt Regency La Jolla, and -- for golf buffs -- the Torreyana Grille at the Sheraton Grande Torrey Pines.
Meeting a business contact for breakfast? Squeeze into the Hob Nob Hill, San Diego's hottest coffee shop, near Balboa Park.
 
Electronic Ticket Agent
Until electronic ticketing acts more like an airline ticket agent, it will attract only a limited number of users. That's why American Express and Continental Airlines may be getting somewhere by having several thousand business fliers test a new "smart card" imbedded with personal preferences and other information . After inserting it in an equally smart Continental card reader, complete with a touch screen and prompts, travelers can switch to an earlier or later flight, upgrade to first class if they're a Gold Elite-level member, change seat assignments, confirm One Pass numbers for mileage credits and obtain boarding passes and receipts.
 
Hot Button
At most of ITT Sheraton's 205 foreign hotels, guests can now use AT&T's direct service on room phones by pressing one button or a three-number combination when calling the United States or 200 other countries.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
A European Inquiry on Accounting Mergers

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Jan. 20

 BODY:
Giant mergers proposed by four of the Big Six accounting firms encountered a potentially serious roadblock today, when the European Commission's top antitrust official announced that he would conduct investigations of both deals.
The announcement in Brussels, by Karel van Miert, signaled the growing concern among European officials that the two proposed mergers could damage competition and perhaps undermine the integrity of the independent auditors. 
 The mergers would immediately reduce the field of worldwide auditing and accounting firms from the Big Six to a Big Four.
The first deal would combine Price Waterhouse with Coopers & Lybrand to create a firm with $13 billion in revenue and 8,500 partners. The second would merge KPMG Peat Marwick with Ernst & Young, to create a firm with revenue of $15 billion and 11,712 partners.
Expressing "serious concerns," Mr. van Miert said he would look into the mergers simultaneously. His announcement starts a process that lasts about four months and has often led to demands by the European Commission, the European Union's administrative arm, for significant changes. A few mergers have been blocked.
Opposition to the accounting firm deals has been steadily increasing in Europe. The Bank of England and the British Financial Services Authority, a regulatory body, have said the mergers could decrease competition among auditors who verify corporate financial results.
Securities regulators have also raised concern that the mergers could blur consulting work and auditing, causing firms to become so dependent on consulting fees that they allow corporate clients to influence the auditors who review their books.
In November, the International Organization of Securities Commissions, an association of stock market regulators, expressed concern about the reduced number of accounting firms and their "increasing reliance on revenues from consulting and other nonaudit services."
KPMG had tried to address some of the criticism by proposing that accounting firms submit to regulatory supervision of the links between consulting and auditing practices. But that idea was assailed by most other accounting firms, which defend the current self-regulatory system.
European lawyers have also objected to the mergers, fearing that the big accounting firms are taking away their business. In most European countries, accounting firms operate in-house legal firms.
Corporations have been quiet about the proposed mergers. But some may also be worried about how four huge firms can avoid conflicts when performing services for rival companies.
Although all four accounting firms are based in the United States, they are also prominent in Europe, as well, and subject to European Commission regulations.
None of them would comment on the announcement today, saying that they had not received formal notification from commission regulators.
Mr. van Miert has a record of imposing his will. Last year, he forced the Boeing Company to drop a prized marketing practice as a condition for approving its acquisition of McDonnell Douglas. And he has challenged major mergers and alliances throughout Europe.
In announcing his intentions today at a news conference in Brussels, he offered no details about the questions he intends to pursue. But his agency, which is called the Ministry of Competition, only undertakes a full-scale merger review after finding potential problems during an initial, monthlong review.
The United States Department of Justice and Congress are also looking into the proposed accounting mergers. The office of Senator Mike DeWine, Republican of Ohio and chairman of the Senate subcommittee that examines antitrust and competition issues, said today that the panel planned to review the consequences of the proposed deals for American companies.
"There is always a concern when you see a decrease in competition in any industry," said Charles Boesel, a spokesman for Senator DeWine.
A long investigation could present problems for the four accounting firms. KPMG and Ernst & Young are running competitive advertising and marketing campaigns, and the longer they have to wait, the longer they must spend money trying to capture market share from each other.

HEADLINE: 2 Buyout Firms Make Deal To Acquire Regal Cinemas

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON and GERALDINE FABRIKANT 

 BODY:
The movie theater business has captivated two of the nation's largest and savviest leveraged buyout firms, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company and Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst, which will join forces to form the world's largest chain of movie theaters. But their agreement, announced yesterday, raises the prices for theaters to a level that many in the business called hard to justify at a time when a multiplex building binge has already given the nation too many screens.
The two firms agreed to buy Regal Cinemas Inc., the nation's second-largest chain, for $1.2 billion in cash, or about $31 a share, and the assumption of $290 million in debt. They plan to combine Regal Cinemas with the United Artists Theater Group, which Hicks, Muse agreed in November to buy for $300 million and the assumption of $550 in debt, and with Act III Cinemas, which Kohlberg Kravis bought last month for $323 million and the assumption of $338 million in debt. 
 The result would be a company with 5,347 screens at 727 theaters in 35 states -- or about 17 percent of the nation's screens now, or 20 percent by the end of 1999 under current building plans. Carmike Cinemas Inc., with more than 2,700 screens, is the leader now.
While Kohlberg Kravis and Hicks, Muse see major gains in a combination from cutting overhead and expenses and from building huge megaplex theaters, analysts and industry executives question whether the combined chain could realize enough economies to justify the price. The buyers of the Regal Cinemas, which is based in Knoxville, Tenn., are paying about 13 times last year's cash flow, while buyers of other theater chains generally pay a price that is about 7 times cash flow. (Cash flow is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.) And theater chains continue to face added pressure from new forms of home entertainment.
"The business has stable demand and overcapacity," said Christopher Dixon, a media analyst with Paine Webber. "So unless Hicks, Muse gets more negotiating power with the film studios, it is a tough deal. And other theater chains, including Cineplex and Carmike, thought they could get better terms as they got bigger and they didn't."
Clifton S. Robbins, a Kohlberg Kravis general partner, said that while he did not expect better terms from the studios, the combined company could drive harder bargains with other suppliers. Regal Cinemas is growing so rapidly, he said, that the purchase price represents only 8.8 times this year's projected cash flow.
But in a business that is building theaters faster than it is filling them, Regal Cinemas, with 2,333 screens, is among the most ambitious, with plans to add 300 screens this year and 300 next year. Its shares fell from more than $36 at midyear to the mid-$20's in December as analysts questioned whether it was growing too rapidly. Bouncing back up last week on reports that it was in talks with Kohlberg Kravis, Regal Cinemas closed yesterday at $29.4375, down 81.25 cents.
Kohlberg Kravis and Hicks, Muse said their transactions would have a total value of $3 billion, including about $600 million from each of the buyout firms, $100 million from management and the rest in debt.
John R. Muse, chief operating officer of Hicks, Muse, said that rather than worsening the glut, Regal's new theaters -- with sharply rising stadium seating and concessions going well beyond popcorn and soda -- often replace the older, smaller theaters that still predominate in some areas. "Dallas probably has more stadium seating than any area in the country, but Boston doesn't have any yet," Mr. Muse said.
With theaters spread across the Southeast, Midwest and Northeast, and some expansion on the West Coast, Regal Cinemas has aimed at midsize cities and growing suburbs. Unlike many other chains, "We've built our theaters where the population is moving," said Michael L. Campbell, chief executive of Regal Cinemas, who will become chief of the combined company.
Lewis Corman, who served as chief operating officer of Tri-Star Pictures when it bought Loews Theaters in 1986, said that consolidating theater circuits without screens in the same market has only limited value. "You can save on central overhead," he said. "But the terms with theater owners will not necessarily get better because the circuits need the studios just as much as the studios need the theaters." Studios usually take 90 percent of ticket revenues when films open, scaling back closer to 50 percent by the end of their runs.
As for theater concessions, already a major profit source for the chains, Mr. Corman expects few further savings because the gross margin is already about 84 percent. Mr. Campbell of Regal said his chain already enjoyed margins of 88 percent, but planned to bring its new partners up to that mark.
The firms said they had no plans to raise ticket prices.
While the theater industry remains fragmented, the latest combination would go a long way to determining its future course. The question a year from now, said Joseph R. Zimmel, a Goldman, Sachs & Company managing director who advised Regal Cinemas, "will be whether this galvanizes the industry in the sense of taking it from a mom-and-pop type of business to a professionally managed industry."

HEADLINE: A House Chief Limits Uses of Any Surplus

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 20

 BODY:
The chief tax writer in the House laid out a plan today to apportion any Federal budget surpluses equally between reducing the national debt and cutting taxes, saying he wanted to shrink the Government and keep any fiscal windfall out of the hands of those politicians who would spend it.
In making his proposal, the lawmaker, Representative Bill Archer, Republican of Texas, sought to advance a new strategy among conservatives in their campaign against the size and the influence of the Federal Government even as the new world of budget prosperity takes from them the argument that huge budget deficits demand austerity. 
 With the deficits all but gone, everyone from President Clinton to some of Mr. Archer's Republican colleagues have started talking about what they want the Government to do now, from building highways to improving child care to expanding health insurance.
At a news conference today, Mr. Archer, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, responded with the proposal that half of any surplus be taken off the table before it could be spent, earmarked for reduction of the Federal Government's $5 trillion debt.
Mr. Archer said forecasts from the Congressional Budget Office suggested that Congress could comfortably pay off $200 billion of the debt over the next 10 years and cut taxes by the same amount without any risk of creating new budget deficits.
That Mr. Archer, one of his party's most ardent tax cutters, would give equal billing to paying down the national debt reflects the economic and political appeal of cleaning up the accumulated financial mess left by decades of deficit spending.
Economists generally agree that paying down the debt would help reduce interest rates, spur private investment and improve the nation's growth rate as it prepares for its next fiscal challenge: paying for the retirement needs of the huge baby-boom generation starting around 2010. Polls show that voters also give high priority to reducing the debt.
"I believe a balanced budget must lead to a smaller, less-taxing Government, letting people keep more of what they earn, easing their financial burdens, freeing them to invest in themselves and their communities," Mr. Archer said. "But for some in Washington, balancing the budget is just an excuse to bring back the era of big government as they unleash the hounds of higher spending."
Democrats said Mr. Archer was jumping the gun by pushing for tax cuts before a surplus was in hand.
"As a majority of Americans have indicated, they want a Government that is responsive and prudent, not a Government that spends money it does not yet have," said Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York, the senior Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee.
Mr. Archer has considerable control over the agenda on taxes in the House, but his approach is sure to run head-on into calls from members of both parties for new spending.
Representative Bud Shuster, the Pennsylvania Republican who heads the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, is leading a bipartisan push for a surge in spending on roads, bridges and mass transit.
Speaker Newt Gringrich has identified the Pentagon and scientific research as in need of increased spending.
And President Clinton has proposed new initiatives on health insurance and child care.
Mr. Archer said he wanted to find a way of reducing taxes across the board, perhaps by expanding to higher income levels the 15 percent tax bracket, which currently rises to 28 percent for income above some $40,100 for couples filing jointly and $24,000 for single filers.
Mr. Archer said he would also consider exempting the first $400 of interest and dividend income. And he promised to take up the issue of the so-called marriage penalty, the provision in the tax code that produces a tax bill for many two-income couples higher than what they would pay if they were not married.
With Republicans and Democrats alike offering new tax proposals almost daily in the run-up to the opening of the new Congressional session next week, Mr. Archer's condemnation of the current tax code was echoed today by Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic leader.
Mr. Gephardt, who has long promoted his own plan to cut taxes for many low- and middle-income people, said in a speech in San Francisco that his proposal would now incorporate a provision to eliminate the marriage penalty, suggesting the issue's broad political appeal.
Mr. Gephardt said his plan would reduce the tax bill for 62 percent of taxpayers. He would eliminate nearly all deductions, credits, exemptions and adjustments except the mortgage interest deduction and the exclusion from taxation of employer-provided health insurance.
Mr. Gephardt's plan is intended to keep Federal tax revenues at their current level. But Mr. Archer said his plan would be based on a goal of driving the nation's overall tax bill substantially lower.
Federal revenues this year are running at 19.9 percent of the nation's total economic output, the highest rate since World War II, driven in part by investors who are cashing in large capital gains from the booming stock market. Mr. Archer said he would seek to cap Federal taxes at 19 percent of economic output within the next decade. Such a cap would amount to a $70 billion tax cut.

HEADLINE: Number on Welfare Rolls Dips Below 10 Million

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 20

 BODY:
The number of people on Federal welfare rolls has dropped below 10 million for the first time in more than 25 years, Clinton Administration officials said today.
Fewer than 4 percent of Americans are now on welfare, the smallest proportion since 1970, the Government reported. 
 The President's Council of Economic Advisers says that more than 40 percent of the decline is attributable to growth of the economy. More than 30 percent results from changes in Federal and state welfare policies and laws, the council said. The remainder is ascribed to other factors, including more aggressive collection of child support.
Rahm I. Emanuel, a senior adviser to President Clinton, said today: "For the first time since 1971, the number of people on welfare is below 10 million. This is a milestone that's based on the reforms that have altered the welfare system to reflect the priority of work and responsibility."
Mr. Emanuel, a strong proponent of the 1996 welfare law, said: "The children of these families whose parents are now working are connected to the mainstream culture, which is built around work. That's a qualitative difference in their lives that can never be measured."
The welfare rolls have been declining for several years. The number of people receiving cash assistance has dropped 29 percent since President Clinton took office and is now far below the peak of 14.4 million recorded in March 1994.
To the surprise of Federal officials and members of Congress, the decline has been accelerating. In January 1997, there were 11.4 million people on welfare, 2.8 million fewer than in January 1993. In the next seven months, from January to August 1997, the rolls declined by about 1.4 million.
Melissa T. Skolfield, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services, said tonight: "In August 1997, the most recent month for which we have figures available, there were 9,995,000 people on welfare. That's a drop of more than 2.2 million since the welfare law was signed in August 1996. The number is at its lowest point since February 1971, when it was 9,952,000."
Officials say the decline in welfare rolls results in part from Federal waivers allowing states to experiment with new welfare policies and from the 1996 law, which established stringent work requirements.

HEADLINE: A Budget to Run On

 BODY:
Taking advantage of the continuing boom on Wall Street, Gov. George Pataki has unveiled an election-year budget for New York State with enough programs to please nearly everyone. The only hitch is that it ignores fiscal prudence.
The proposed $71.9 billion budget reverses course after three years of attempts to trim state support for schools, higher education, welfare and health programs. In fact, aggregate spending from state funds would rise 8.5 percent, a boost reminiscent of the palmy Cuomo years. The budget is thus certain to enhance the Governor's re-election chances among those hit by cuts in the past. 
 But the budget does nothing to improve the state's precarious fiscal health. Once again, Mr. Pataki projects bigger multibillion-dollar deficits down the road, the main reason for the state's dismal credit rating. Figuring out how to finance these gaps will be the first headache to be faced by the next governor, whether it is Mr. Pataki or someone else. The deficits arise primarily from the exploding cost of tax cuts enacted last year, particularly the new program to subsidize local property tax cuts. If an economic downturn recurs, the state would have to cut spending or rescind tax cuts.
Like President Clinton, who recently unveiled the first balanced Federal budget in a generation, Mr. Pataki has reaped the benefits of prosperity. The current fiscal year will end March 31 with a record $1.8 billion surplus. Mr. Pataki would use much of that surplus to pay for sports stadiums and other pork-barrel projects that were approved by the Legislature last summer. That is throwing good money into a lot of dubious places. But since the Legislature originally intended to finance the projects by borrowing, Mr. Pataki's use of the surplus for this purpose can be viewed as a better alternative in a bad situation. Even so, his budget would drive borrowing by the state to a record $36 billion, mostly because of highway construction, prisons and higher-education spending.
The Governor's decision to avoid using the surplus to grant new tax cuts is prudent. He would simply accelerate by a year cuts that were already enacted, a move that would not worsen budget deficits in subsequent years. He now needs to persuade the Senate majority leader, Joseph Bruno, to avoid his usual move to add still more tax cuts without paying for them. Mr. Bruno was generally supportive of the budget yesterday, declaring that "happy days are here again" for Republicans.
New York City would benefit, as the budget makes good on the Governor's promise last year to increase the proportion of state spending that goes to city schools. Since the accelerated property tax relief will go mostly to districts in the suburbs and upstate, the Legislature may well want to improve the school aid formulas even further. There may also be a need to increase help for drug treatment programs, children's services, school construction and programs to help welfare recipients find and hold jobs.
More politically significant than Mr. Bruno's reaction to the budget was the generally supportive reaction from the Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver. The Democrats are certain to try to rearrange Mr. Pataki's priorities, but probably only on the margins. This was a budget designed to please the constituents of both parties in the coming year while ignoring the long-term peril.

Little Progress in Meeting Of Clinton and Netanyahu
President Clinton presented Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel with a plan for the phased Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank. But Mr. Netanyahu made clear that Israeli redeployment would depend on Palestinian compliance with Israeli demands. A1 

After a private meeting with Mr. Netanyahu, the Rev. Jerry Falwell said he would mobilize evangelical churches to oppose giving more territory to the Palestinians. A1
 
The chairman of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum said that rescinding an invitation to the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, had been a terrible error and that the museum's executive council would extend a formal invitation. A6
 
Papal Visit to Cuba
Pope John Paul II was to arrive in Cuba today, and he will find a capital transformed by the presence of more than 3,000 journalists. A1
 
The Pope will encounter a Roman Catholic Church short of staff and vastly weakened by Fidel Castro's rule, but one unified and determined to push for a greater role in Cuban society. A8
 
The Pope is expected to denounce the United States' 37-year embargo of Cuba, in a call unlikely to influence the White House. A8
 
No Ordinary Date in Germany
A German scholar, Christian Gerlach, has published an article asserting that Hitler made a personal decision to put to death German Jews and all other European Jews under Nazi occupation.

Suharto Hints at Successor
President Suharto of Indonesia gave a strong hint that his choice for his next Vice President and potential successor was a longtime aide, Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie, 61, a German-trained aeronautical engineer with unorthodox economic views who holds the post of Minister of Research and Technology. A3
 
No Progress With Iraq
Preparing for his final session of talks with the Iraqi Government, Richard Butler, the chief United Nations weapons inspector, said Iraq was clinging to "disarmament by declaration" and refusing to provide further documentation to back its claims that certain weapons had been eliminated. He rejected Iraqi demands that American U-2 surveillance planes flying over Iraq for the United Nations be replaced with Russian or French aircraft. A3

Unabom Suspect Judged Competent to Stand Trial
Theodore J. Kaczynski is competent to stand trial on charges that he is the Unabomber, defense lawyers conceded. With that issue resolved, the Federal judge in the case suggested that he would keep the current defense team in place and hold Mr. Kaczynski to an agreement to use a mental-illness defense at least in the penalty phase of his trial.

A Plan for Surpluses
Representative Bill Archer, Republican of Texas, the chief tax writer in the House, laid out a plan to apportion any Federal budget surpluses equally between reducing the national debt and cutting taxes, saying he wanted to shrink the Government and keep any fiscal windfall out of the hands of those politicians who would spend it. A15
 
Winfrey's Trial Begins
The talk show host Oprah Winfrey entered a Federal courthouse in Amarillo, Tex., as the defendant in an unusual defamation trial. Ms. Winfrey is being sued by a group of Texas cattlemen who contend that she cost them millions of dollars with a program in April 1996 about mad cow disease. A10
 
Senator Feinstein Declines
Senator Dianne Feinstein announced that she would not run for governor of California this year, despite public opinion polls that showed her as the consistent front-runner and despite encouragement by leading Democrats. A10
 
Welfare Rolls Shrink
The number of people on Federal welfare rolls has dropped below 10 million for the first time in more than 25 years, Clinton Administration officials said. Fewer than 4 percent of Americans are now on welfare, the smallest proportion since 1970, the Government reported. A13
 
The Sexes in the Military
The Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services, a panel formed in the 1950's to advise the Defense Department on women's issues, said it had found that most members of the armed services want more integration of the sexes during their early months in uniform. The finding came a month after another advisory committee urged the Defense Department to separate men and women during much of their military training. A12
 
Scientists Clone Calves
Two scientists at the University of Massachusetts announced that they had cloned two calves from the cells of cow fetuses. Experts said the achievement essentially repeated work done with sheep, but simplified it and extended it to a more useful species. A14

Undercover Officers Find Jobs Ever More Hazardous
Law enforcement experts said that the city's 1,000 or so undercover drug officers, who are overwhelmingly black or Hispanic, are finding their work increasingly perilous as drug dealers move their operations off the streets and inside buildings. Mayor Giuliani called the shooting death of an undercover police officer, Sean Carrington, a tragedy, but he fiercely defended the value of the type of anti-drug operation that Officer Carrington was involved in when he was killed Monday night. Two suspects have been arrested. A1
 
New Map of Subway System
The M.T.A. has redesigned the familiar subway map. The free map, which includes the entire M.T.A. system, now shows the bus connections available at all the major subway stations, and more than a dozen ferry connections. B4
 
Going to School, at Camp
Chancellor Rudy Crew said that he would like to send as many as 10,000 New York City public-school children to sleepaway camps in the Catskills and elsewhere each year, beginning this summer, in an effort to extend schooling into the summer but shift it to a more bucolic setting. B3
 
Pataki Would Raise Spending
Governor Pataki proposed an election-year budget that was 7.6 percent larger than the last, swelled by a rise in school spending agreed to last year and new increases for education and health care. B1

HEADLINE: With Pope Due, the Cubans Wrest Dollars From Heaven

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: HAVANA, Jan. 20

 BODY:
At the Hotel Habana Libre, Dan Rather and his CBS News team are already ensconced on the 16th floor, while Ted Koppel and the "Nightline" staff are down on the 12th. Peter Jennings flew in Monday night, Tom Brokaw is expected today, and even Martha Stewart is coming in her role as a regular contributor to "CBS This Morning."
On the eve of Pope John Paul II's five-day visit to Cuba, Havana is a city transformed. 
 An army of reporters and television crews from the United States and more than 50 other countries has invaded the Cuban capital, throwing its slow-paced routine into overdrive and poking about without interference into nearly every corner and crevice of this normally restrictive society.
For the Cuban Government, especially the ministries and state companies that are providing services for the papal visit, the influx has already yielded a financial windfall. In a country that has operated under Communism for nearly 40 years, the law of supply and demand is suddenly being applied with a vengeance, resulting in what one travel agent called "Super Bowl prices" for everything from hotel rooms to satellite links.
Until Friday, a double room at the seafront Hotel Nacional was $105 a night and could be booked through almost any travel agent outside the United States, where the economic embargo against Cuba limits such commercial contacts.
Now, the same room costs $285 a night, and independent travel agents in Mexico, Canada and elsewhere complain they have been squeezed out of bookings by Cuban agencies that have links to the Cuban military.
The Government has imposed a series of creative new charges on equipment and supplies.
Want to bring in a satellite telephone? The Ministry of Communications is demanding a $1,000 "licensing fee" per telephone, plus $500 for each week the phone is in use.
Each of the four main American networks has at least 100 people here and they will likely end up having spent at least $1 million apiece once all their bills are paid. Their single biggest cost is a $100,000 "host TV fee" that Cuban state television is charging each of them for the live video feed of the Pope's activities, which normally is provided free or at minimal cost.
"We tried to negotiate some of these costs, but there wasn't much room for movement," said Phil Alongi, an NBC News producer who handled his network's contacts with the Cuban authorities. "It's their place and they have you."
Even after prices are agreed upon and bills are paid, arrangements may be subject to attempts at revision. Two American television executives said that Cuban customs officials informed them that the duties paid for a shipment of equipment earlier in the month were off by a decimal point: instead of being $5,000, the "corrected" bill was actually $50,000.
"Havana has become a three-ring circus," Chris Gillette of A.P. Television said this morning, as dozens of reporters jostled their way through the lobby of the Habana Libre, known as the Hilton until Fidel Castro's revolution put Cuba off-limits for all but a handful of Americans. "I have been coming here for years, and I have never, ever seen the place like this."
El Morro, the fortress and lighthouse that is Havana's most famous landmark, has become the backdrop to the set where CBS will be broadcasting its nightly news this week.
Cameramen in shorts roam the cobblestoned streets and plazas of Old Havana, drawing gapes and friendly japes from residents whose exposure to foreigners 10 years ago was limited to Russians and their allies.
All told, Cuban officials said, more than 3,000 reporters representing 460 foreign news organizations, including four reporters and one photographer from The New York Times,have already been granted credentials for the papal visit, "some of them from the most unlikely publications you could imagine," said Frank Gonzalez, director of the Government's International Press Center. Of that total, Americans make up the largest group, with more than 1,300 correspondents, editors, camera operators and other personnel accredited.
One notable absence, however, is Jose Diaz-Balart, the Cuban-American co-host of CBS's "This Morning" program. Though he is Mr. Castro's nephew by marriage, Mr. Diaz-Balart and his family, led by his brother, the Republican Congressman Lincoln Diaz-Balart of Miami, have long been fierce and outspoken critics of Mr. Castro and his Government, which regularly castigates them as leaders of what is known in official jargon here as "the Miami exile mafia."
It is hard to imagine an atmosphere further removed from Connecticut gentility than the socialist austerity of Cuba, but Martha Stewart is here nonetheless.
Al Ortiz, a CBS News vice president, said that she had been brought down to "try to bring some added slice of life or flavor to our coverage" and that "our hard news coverage is in no way affected" by her presence.
"There's a lot to say about life style down here," Mr. Ortiz added. "She is not going to do superficial, feel-good stuff, but will make an honest attempt to look at how people live here" with reports about, for example, paladares, the small private restaurants Cubans are now allowed to operate.
Since beginning a drive earlier this decade to encourage tourism, Cuba has grown used to receiving European and Canadian visitors on inexpensive package tours.
But the arrival of a phalanx of journalists on expense accounts has meant a welcome injection of hard currency not just for paladares, but also for hotels, taxi drivers and shops, especially those selling cigars and rum.
"In my whole life, I've never seen so many rich foreigners on the streets of Havana at the same time," exulted Xiomara Lopez Pedraza, a handicrafts vendor at a market in the Vedado area, where most of the hotels lodging reporters are located. "Too bad the Pope can't come to Cuba every year."
Although some reporters and producers are bridling at the price gouging, many praise the performance of other sectors of the Cuban bureaucracy, especially the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Requests for interviews are being answered promptly, reporters are actually being encouraged to wander wherever they want, and many Americans have been granted visas that allow them to stay for 30 days instead of one week, the usual pattern.
Among major American news organizations, only The Miami Herald, which Cuba's state security apparatus regards as a Cuban exile mouthpiece, has been denied all requests for visas for its reporters. Visas were also denied to a Newsweek reporter who once wrote about young people injecting themselves with the AIDS virus and a reporter from The St. Petersburg Times who wrote a long piece about the re-emergence of prostitution here.
One European diplomat with long experience here estimates that thanks to the new licenses and higher prices, the papal visit will generate a profit of at least $25 million for the Cuban Government. "This is a one-time opportunity, and they are determined to make the best of it," he said.
At a Monday news conference here, Jose Luis Rodriguez, Minister of the Economy and Planning, declined to estimate how much money the Cuban Government is likely to make from the event. "This has not been looked at as a business venture, so we haven't made a calculation," he said.

Revenge on the Nerds

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
I figured things were way out of perspective in the Other Washington when I heard that Bill Gates had put an inscription from "The Great Gatsby" around the domed ceiling of the library in his new $100 million pad: "He had come a long way to this blue lawn and his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it."
Bill Gates was obviously unaware of the magnitude of the truth that he had unwittingly admitted. 
 When he read about the blue lawn, he must have imagined computers with glowing blue screens stretching to infinity. And he must certainly have liked the proximity of the words "dream" and "grasp."
With a judge who is likely soon to hold Microsoft in contempt for petulantly defying an order designed to give its rivals any chance, Mr. Gates's dream may at last have exceeded his grasp. The Justice Department never came down on Gatsby.
This Washington has disabused that Washington of its arrogant presumption that what's good for Microsoft is good for America. This Washington has stripped that Washington of its image as warm, tender, flannel-and-soyburger pioneers of the new economy, and properly pegged Microsoft as an egomaniacal, dangerous giant that has cut off the air supply of competitors in a bid to control cyberspace.
"The only thing the robber barons did that Bill Gates hasn't done is use dynamite against their competitors," Gary Reback, a Silicon Valley antitrust lawyer, told John Heilemann of The New Yorker.
The disheveled college dropout who used to get adoring headlines like "A Regular Guy Who's a Legend: Bill Gates Puts a New Face on the American Dream" now looks like a spoiled rich brat. When they treated the Justice Department and the judge with the same contempt they treat competitors with, the masters of the virtual universe got hit with a grim truth: People hate Microsoft even more than they hate the Government.
Mr. Gates has gone from Horatio Alger similes to virus similes. Frederick Warren-Boulton, another antitrust expert, told The New Yorker: "Gates is like smallpox. You have to go in there and you have to nail it. If you leave it lying around, it will just come back."
When asked who they thought had done more good for the future of America, Bill Gates or Bill Clinton, more Americans chose Mr. Clinton. (Even though portfolio-obsessed Americans would still rather have their children grow up to be more like Mr. Gates than Mr. Clinton, by 47 to 24 percent.)
As Jacob Weisberg plaintively wrote in Slate, Microsoft's on-line magazine: "A few months ago, everyone I met seemed to think that working for Microsoft was a pretty cool thing to do. Now, strangers treat us like we work for Philip Morris."
The Times's Timothy Egan explored the angst that has gripped the Redmond campus since Microsoft lost its sheen. Some fret that the fate of the entire Pacific Northwest is at stake.
All the instant millionaires in thermal shirts, droopy drawers and sandals with wool socks are suddenly Wondering If It's All Worth It. They have staggered out of the Seattle fog long enough to listen to their inner browsers.
This has been a rude shock to them because they honestly believed that our Washington was full of anti-business, careerist bureaucrats, and their Washington was full of imaginative idealists and entrepreneurs who buy and sell to the beat of a different drum. They didn't reckon smokestack laws could apply to high technology.
As Mr. Gates's lawyer, William Neukom, told Steve Lohr of The Times, "We sincerely believe that we are a force for good in the economy." Actually, Microsoft has been a force for greed in the economy, more brilliant at marketing and purloining and crushing than it has been at innovating. The company saw the fight with the Justice Department as a defense of its way of life. And that way was hardball on software; anything Microsoft decided was a core threat to it was sucked into the operating system.
These are Darwinian nerds. Besides, Microsoft couldn't even save the universe in "Independence Day." It took an Apple to do that.

Stocks Up in Japan, Helped by Wall Street's Gain

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Wednesday, Jan. 21

 BODY:
Japanese stocks rose today for a sixth day, helped by Wall Street's gains and the possibility of additional measures to invigorate the domestic economy.
Elsewhere in Asia, South Korean stocks fell sharply. Other Asian markets were mixed. 
 Japan's benchmark Nikkei average of 225 issues closed up 317.89 points, or 1.94 percent, to 16,684.42.
Traders attributed the gain partly to a carry-over effect from the advances on Tuesday on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.5 percent and broader stock averages also strengthened.
Further helping the Japanese market were more hints the Government might issue another economic stimulus package.
Koichi Kato, secretary general of the governing Liberal Democratic Party, said on Tuesday that efforts to reduce the Government budget deficit should be delayed if the economy remained stagnant, the Nihon Keizai newspaper reported. He also said there was room to increase spending on public works.
In Seoul, stocks dropped 5.1 percent on profit-taking from the market's recent gains and the uncertainty regarding efforts to renegotiate the nation's short-term debt. A South Korean delegation was conferring with international bank representatives in New York today.
By late afternoon, the South Korean market's main index was down 27.40 points, to 506.15.
In other Asian markets, Indonesia's composite stock index rose 4.4 percent, largely on demand for shares of PT Telkom, which was viewed as an increasingly attractive investment because of the diminished value of the rupiah currency.
Stocks fell 2.64 percent in Hong Kong by midday, 1.42 percent in Singapore and 1.05 percent in the Philippines but were slightly higher in Thailand.

HEADLINE: Whitman Urges Funds for Cities And Open Land

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON 

DATELINE: NEWARK, Jan. 20

 BODY:
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman pledged today in her second inaugural address to devote her next term to rebuilding neighborhoods in New Jersey's cities and protecting farmland and other open space from development.
Mrs. Whitman, taking the oath of office at the newly built New Jersey Performing Arts Center here, said: "I want to make our state more affordable, our schools stronger, and our communities safer. Ultimately, my mission is to make New Jersey more livable." 
 In the first inaugural since 1844 to be held outside Trenton, where the usual site is closed, Mrs. Whitman delivered a 22-minute address before 2,800 friends, supporters, lawmakers and state officials, emphasizing the importance of planning and controlling development in the nation's most densely populated state.
 She said the experience of driving around the state had given her a sense of urgency about the state's future. "I have a vision for that future," she said, "a vision for rebuilding our cities, preserving our open space, and enriching our sense of personal responsibility."
She said she would spend $400 million to help cities reclaim and develop abandoned properties. She vowed to stem suburban sprawl by giving municipalities the tools to stop development projects that overburden congested roadways and crowded schools. She also pledged to commit state dollars to preserve 300,000 acres of farmland in the next four years, with the ultimate goal of preserving one million acres in the next decade.
At the same time, she recommended giving developers incentives, like speedy state permit approvals, to build in areas that have already been targeted for development by the state.
"Every part of New Jersey suffers when we plan haphazardly," she said. "Sprawl eats up our open space. It creates traffic jams that boggle the mind and pollute the air. Sprawl can make one feel downright claustrophobic about our future."
Mrs. Whitman also called for increased state spending for community colleges to hold the line on tuition increases.
She pledged to give $5 million to help urban religious leaders and organizations support child care, job training and economic development projects in their communities.
And in other steps she said were intended to improve the quality of life, she proposed constructing 2,000 miles of hiking and bike paths over the next 10 years. She also said she would offer plans in the next two months to increase bus and train lines and improve safety on roadways.
Mrs. Whitman did not talk about some of the more immediate concerns of New Jerseyans that dominated last fall's gubernatorial race: the high cost of automobile insurance and property taxes. Nor did she propose any new tax cuts, a step that marked her first term and helped make her a national figure within the Republican Party.
But last week, during her annual address to the Legislature, she addressed the issue of property taxes and promised to be able to sign into law an auto insurance plan in March. She is expected to discuss her plans to control government spending when she unveils her new state budget next month.
The themes that Mrs. Whitman chose to emphasize in her inaugural address have been embraced by past New Jersey governors, Democrats and Republicans alike. In focusing on reviving cities and controlling development, Mrs. Whitman was tackling problems that have bedeviled other New Jersey politicians for years.
Her top aides said that despite the record of the past, she was determined that her final term would address development in the cities, which have not shared in the state's economic boom, and controlling development in the suburban and rural areas.
Her biggest challenge will be persuading some state and local officials to support her agenda for stemming suburban sprawl. Some municipal officials have embraced unplanned development of open space in the short term so they can hold down property taxes for current residents by increasing their property tax base. Mrs. Whitman said her administration intended to show municipal leaders that new development could often increase the local property tax burden in the long term by increasing the demand for local services.
She also faces difficulty persuading Republican legislators to pour state dollars into the cities. Since her narrow re-election victory last fall, Republican legislative leaders have hinted that they are prepared to set their own agenda for the state, and providing further state assistance to cities has never topped their priority list, because most of their constituents live in the suburban and rural areas.
Nevertheless, the state's Republican legislative leaders, Assembly Speaker Jack Collins and Senate President Donald T. DiFrancesco, had only warm praise for Mrs. Whitman's speech.
"I think that she touched on the things that all New Jerseyans care about, some more than others," Mr. Collins said. "But everybody cares about the future of this state, the air we breathe, the water we drink, open space. I think she was really on target."
For the most part, Democrats offered milder remarks. "I don't think there was any meat on the bone," the Senate Minority Leader, Richard J. Codey, said.
But United States Senator Robert G. Torricelli, a Democrat, said he believed Democrats could embrace the goals Mrs. Whitman described. "It is a remarkably progressive agenda," Mr. Torricelli said. "She is likely to have more trouble from Republicans than Democrats. I admire Governor Whitman for taking on the fight. I hope that she has the strength to win."
Before arriving at her swearing-in ceremony, Mrs. Whitman attended an interfaith service at the Cathedral Basilica of the Sacred Heart in Newark. Outside the Roman Catholic church, about 150 opponents of abortion rights stood behind police barricades to protest Mrs. Whitman's decision to veto state legislation that would impose a ban on a type of late-term abortion.
The Performing Arts Center here, considered the cornerstone of the effort to revive the downtown of the state's largest city, was chosen as the site of the inaugural partly because the Trenton War Memorial, where inaugurations are usually held, has been closed for the last three years for renovations. But Mrs. Whitman also said the center represented the state's commitment to its cities. "Urban mayors, I give you my word," Mrs. Whitman said. "Together, we can pull down those boards. Together, we can raise up these neighborhoods."
Douglas Palmer, the Mayor of Trenton, said he was encouraged by Mrs. Whitman's pledge, particularly her proposal to give state assistance to religious leaders who are already working to help revive urban neighborhoods. "She is not giving lip service," Mr. Palmer said. "She is giving the tools that will help cities spur economic revitalization and growth."
State officials estimate that there are thousands of abandoned properties across the state that owe municipalities between $250 million and $300 million in back taxes. Since it is now time-consuming and costly for a municipality to acquire some abandoned properties, the state would speed up the process by covering the cost of a property owner's tax liens on those abandoned properties that have been designated for development.
The state would borrow up to $400 million through the state Economic Development Authority for the program. The debt would be paid back with proceeds from the sale and development of the properties, state officials said.
Mrs. Whitman closed her speech by talking about the importance of personal responsibility and challenging New Jerseyans to give an hour or two of their time to a cause that would help others.
She cited her own example by dedicating a few hours every month to reading for Recordings for the Blind and Dyslexic.
"As I make this commitment, I recognize that it's not much," she said. "But it's more than I am doing today. I challenge each of you to make the same kind of new start."

HEADLINE: Spending Rise Of 7% Sought In Pataki Plan

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 20

 BODY:
Reversing course from the austere program he brought to office three years ago, Gov. George E. Pataki proposed an election-year budget today that is 7.6 percent larger than the last, swelled by a major rise in school spending that was agreed to last year and new increases for education and health care.
The same Governor who, in his first two years, held spending flat proposed a $71.9 billion budget, up from $66.8 billion, the largest proportional increase since the heady days of the mid-1980's. Much of the rise in spending would go toward areas that Mr. Pataki fought to cut in previous years -- aid to schools and universities, health care for the poor -- and he also called for construction of a new maximum-security prison. 
 "Three years of conservative fiscal practices and smart economic policies have turned crisis into comeback," Mr. Pataki proclaimed in a 33-minute speech that was as long on politics as on numbers.
Last year, the Governor agreed to calls from Democratic legislators for a major increase in educational spending in each of the next four years, and the increase in his proposed budget for the fiscal year that begins on April 1 was, in part, a product of that deal.
But Mr. Pataki also proposed a range of new spending initiatives that sometimes sounded more like the work of a Democrat than a budget-cutting Republican: an English-immersion program for foreign-born students, a pilot after-school program in some schools, more money for child care for poor parents, more money for parks, and an expansion of health care for uninsured children through the age of 18.
And after three straight years of trying to make deep cuts in Medicaid, the state's costly health care program primarily for the poor that accounts for the biggest piece of the state budget -- 35 percent in the spending plan the Governor proposed today -- he proposed allowing it to grow by more than 5 percent.
As might have been predicted, reactions from the two legislative leaders whose support the Governor needs for his budget plan fell along partisan lines. Sheldon Silver, the Assembly Speaker, called it "a budget drawn to be an election-year budget." The Governor's budget plan, said Mr. Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, is meant to let Mr. Pataki "go out to all groups and say, 'Here's what I'm doing.' "
The Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, a Republican from Rensselaer County, described it as "a great budget for the people of New York State."
While Mr. Pataki's turnabout may do him the political favor of softening his image as a fiscal conservative preaching sacrifice, it drew criticism from independent fiscal monitors. They had praised Mr. Pataki in the past for imposing discipline on the state's spending, but today they said they were disappointed that his latest plan not only increased spending but ialso ncluded another round of tax cuts.
The newly proposed tax cuts, not nearly on the scale of those he won in each of the three previous years, are mainly an acceleration of property tax cuts enacted last year.
His other proposed tax cuts include an expansion of tax credits for large businesses that locate in New York, and acceleration of New York City's income tax cut for some elderly city residents.
"We've made progress over time" in balancing the state's budget over the long run, said Andrew Rein, senior research associate at the Citizens Budget Commission, a private organization. "But this budget goes back on that progress." He noted that by the state's own projections, it will have a deficit of more than $4.5 billion in three years that will have to be closed with spending cuts, postponement of scheduled tax cuts or, perhaps, even tax increases.
Mr. Pataki, clearly anticipating the assertion that increasing spending while cutting taxes was risky, repeatedly insisted as he spoke in the auditorium of the state theater across from the Capitol that he remains a fiscal conservative. "We're restraining state spending like never before," he said.
And in a news conference later, he challenged reporters who questioned the prudence of the spending plan, waving copies of articles they had written that made the same criticism of his previous budget proposals. Events had proved them wrong, he said, commenting, "Why not just write the same articles you did last year and the year before?"
Since Mr. Pataki's election, the state has ridden an economic boom, driven largely by the boom on Wall Street, that has allowed New York to cut taxes and increase spending simultaneously. The Governor insisted that his fiscal plan did not rely on a continued bull market, but the plan also assumes that there will not be an economic downturn -- or even a serious slowdown in growth -- in the next several years.
In a budget address that rang with sound bites reminiscent of a campaign speech, Mr. Pataki ranged far afield from purely fiscal matters, repeating his call for an end to parole for violent felons and thanking people for the aid they have sent to victims of the recent ice storm in northern New York.
The budget presentation -- once a modest affair in the Governor's office -- has grown in recent years into a large, tightly choreographed event held in a theater and attended by hundreds of legislators, state officials and gubernatorial aides, with a corps of troopers and other state workers controlling the human traffic.
Historically, proposals by a Governor of either party have provided a floor for budget talks with the Legislature, and the budget that is finally enacted is invariably larger. In recent years, those negotiations have lasted longer and longer, often tying up the capital well into the summer.
But this year, as Mr. Pataki seeks a second term, there may be more common ground between the Governor and his legislative adversaries, since two areas that have historically been favorites of the Legislature -- education and health care -- account for most of the budget increase.
The proposed budget also contains a 4.7 percent increase in aid to school districts -- the second-largest part of the budget -- to $11.45 billion, a reflection of the multiyear agreement on education spending that was contained in last year's budget. That agreement provided an increase of $100 million in money for school construction and repair -- to $900 million -- and money for expanded pre-kindergarten programs and class-size reduction.
In addition, Mr. Pataki sought to double spending on construction for the State University of New York and City University systems, to $515 million, along with an increase in tuition assitance for students, which he tried to cut in previous years.
Mr. Pataki also proposed an expansion in state-subsidized child care for welfare recipients and the working poor, to 125,000 from 114,000.
Over all, the $71.9 billion proposed budget is nearly $5 billion larger than the one enacted last year but about one-third of that is Federal money for programs like Medicaid and welfare, which tend to increase regardless of state actions.
Still, the part of the budget that is generated by state taxes and fees, which Mr. Pataki held without an increase his first two years, would rise 8.5 percent next year under his plan, from $45 billion, to $48.8 billion.
Mr. Silver, the Assembly Speaker, said that "only in rhetoric" did the Governor's latest budget proposal and his first ones resemble each other. The Speaker said he would like to see an increase in basic school aid about $300 million larger than the one Mr. Pataki requested, and about $500 million more in school construction money than the Governor proposed.
Last year's budget agreement, if left untouched, would automatically mean $500 million in tax cuts during the fiscal year that begins on April 1. Mr. Pataki proposed raising that figure to $1.2 billion, mostly by accelerating cuts in property taxes and other levies that were to take place further in the future.
Last year, state lawmakers agreed to exempt clothing from the sales tax starting next year, and today the Governor called for including shoes in that exemption, a favorite request of New York City's Mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani.
Mr. Giuliani said that he would have liked to see a greater commitment from Mr. Pataki to drug treatment but that "by and large, it's a positive budget from the point of view of the city."
The Governor's largess could avoid some of the nasty conflicts that have produced the four latest budgets in state history the last four years. But he made a few proposals that are guaranteed to turn into fights with the Democrats who control the Assembly.
Mr. Pataki asked for $180 million for a 1,500-bed, maximum-security prison, and the Assembly Democrats have generally resisted prison construction, instead calling, like Mr. Giuliani, for more treatment beds for drug abusers.

Chart: "HIGHLIGHTS: What Pataki's Budget Would Do"
The Governor's overall budget proposal of $71.9 billion -- which covers money from all sources, including the Federal Government -- would raise state spending by 7.6 percent. State spending alone would increase from the current $45 billion, to $48.8 billion, an 8.5 percent increase. Negotiations with the Legislature are almost certain to yield a final package that is larger on both accounts.
 
TAX CUTS
The budget proposes accelerating the school property tax cut for most elderly homeowners and an income tax reduction for seniors in New York City with low and moderate income, at a total cost of $500 million. It would also speed up the exemption of up to 250 acres of farmland from school property taxes ($71 million). It also proposes $45 million in tax cuts by extending to two the sales-tax-free weeks in January 1999 for all clothing and shoes costing less than $500; $50 million in tax savings through a 25 percent reduction in motor vehicle registration fees, and a state income tax exemption on all Holocaust reparation payments, the tax implications of which are not known at this point.
 
SCHOOL AID
Under the Governor's plan, state spending for secondary and elementary schools would increase by $518 million, bringing total spending for the year to $11.45 billion. Some of the new spending would go for charter schools, summer school for fourth graders, an English immersion program for children in kindergarten through second grade, full-day kindergarten, and expansion of the pre-kindergarten program.
 
HIGHER EDUCATION
The budget raises state aid to the State University of New York and the City University of New York to $2.58 billion, a 4.8 percent increase that should allow tuition to remain unchanged next year. Part of that increase is a doubling of spending on capital projects, to $515 million.
 
PRISONS
The Governor proposes spending $180 million for a new maximum-security state prison that would open in the 2000-2001 budget year.
 
ENVIRONMENT
The Governor recommended $125 million for the state's Environmental Protection Fund, a $25 million increase. (pg. B6)

HEADLINE: Good-News Budget

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 20

 BODY:
In his first three years in office, Gov. George E. Pataki proposed some of the most contentious state budgets of the last 50 years: ideological cauldrons bubbling with demands for huge cuts in health care, welfare and education, along with tuition hikes at public universities and massive tax cuts.
The Republican Governor got some of what he wanted, but not all, and it came at the cost of extended public combat that undermined his relationship with the Legislature and hurt his reputation with the public. 
 But there was little talk of cuts or austerity in the budget Mr. Pataki offered today. Indeed, in Mr. Pataki's peppy budget presentation -- which had more of the trappings of a campaign kick-off than the annual gubernatorial accounting of the state's finances -- there was no mention of anything that might unsettle the Legislature, the lobbyists, the unions or the public at large.
And that was clearly how it was intended. The Governor's proposed budget, viewed in conjunction with his State of the State Message of two weeks ago, leaves little doubt that if Mr. Pataki has his way, 1998 will, in tone and ambition, be the opposite of his combative first three sessions in Albany. If his previous years here became often unruly attempts to impose the fiscally conservative political philosophy he had espoused throughout his career, the next 10 months are designed to be as placid as Mr. Pataki can manage.
In the view of many Democrats and Republicans here for the budget presentation, Mr. Pataki has replaced, at least for now, his philosophical designs on changing New York with a far more immediate objective: winning re-election later this year. And not simply winning (since Mr. Pataki's advisers are convinced that that will not be difficult), but defeating his Democratic rival with a large enough margin to establish himself as the dominant Republican from the Northeast, someone national Republicans will notice when the year 2000 rolls around.
That means, according to one of Mr. Pataki's political advisers, remaining fiscally responsible while coasting through this legislative session without the delays and often unseemly squabbling that marked his first three years here.
"The real Pataki is what we saw in the first couple of years," said State Senator Martin Connor, the Brooklyn Democrat and minority leader, after studying Mr. Pataki's latest budget plan. "This is the very pragmatic, get-me-re-elected Pataki."
"It's the old story in an election year," Mr. Connor continued, with a note of admiration. "He didn't leave the Democrats a lot of room to stand on. He's just captured so much of the middle."
In previous years, Democrats attacked Mr. Pataki's budgets as an assault on the poor and middle-class. Unions ran television advertisements depicting him as an enemy of the frail elderly; students shouted him down on state university campuses. The Legislature pounded him at every opportunity.
But today, Democrats were flummoxed to hear Mr. Pataki, who kept spending flat in his first two budgets and increased spending only moderately last year, calling for a 7.6 percent spending increase in a budget plan, chockablock with new spending. In one of more striking political role reversals of recent times, the conservative Republican Governor was attacked as reckless -- by a Democrat.
"George Pataki's proposed budget is the most fiscally irresponsible in history," said Peter F. Vallone, the Speaker of New York City Council and one of the Democrats seeking to challenge the Governor.
At first glance, Mr. Pataki is doing what politicians commonly do: Pushing through their most controversial ideas as soon as possible, in the calculation that bad memories will fade from the public mind by election time. For Mr. Pataki, that meant advocating harsh cuts in Medicaid, welfare and education in 1995 and 1996 as he sought to erase a $5 billion state budget deficit, and changing fiscal practices he and his conservative allies labeled irresponsible.
The $5 billion budget deficit is indeed gone, replaced by a surplus -- due to Mr. Pataki's strategies and, even more importantly, say many economists, to Wall Street's good times. Hence, this year's good-news budget.
"This budget is meant to offset the damage that was done in 1995," said James L. Larocca, a former State Transportation Commissioner and another Democrat seeking to challenge Mr. Pataki. "But I think people will see through this as an election year budget."
But, in the end, there is a reason someone who was barely known beyond his home town of Peekskill four years ago seems headed for re-election today. Sheldon Silver, the Assembly Speaker, chuckled softly this afternoon when asked why the Medicaid cuts that had been central to Mr. Pataki's previous budgets were absent today. "He probably read the polls," Mr. Silver said.

Funds for Women's Group

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO 

 BODY:
The United States Small Business Administration has committed $750,000 over five years to establish the Women's Business Center in New York, an organization that will help women start their own businesses.
The new center, one of 10 such centers nationwide that the Federal agency has agreed to finance this year, joining 49 others, is to be administered by the Women's Venture Fund, a three-year-old nonprofit organization that gives loans to women in low-income communities in New York City to create a business. The Small Business Administration has required that its annual grants of $150,000 be matched, and the Women's Venture Fund is seeking corporate and private donations. 
 The Women's Business Center is to operate out of the Venture Fund's offices at 155 East 42d Street. A spokeswoman for the Venture Fund, Maria Semidei-Otero, said the new enterprise and grant money would provide technical assistance to women who are seeking commercial bank loans.
"The Women's Venture Fund has been very imaginative so far in their development of programs to assist women and have worked with very diverse populations," Thomas M. Bettridge, a regional administrator for the Small Business Administration responsible for New York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, said yesterday. "We were glad they had a wide reach in terms of their activities." LISA W. FODERARO

Overseas Crisis Takes a Toll On Earnings Of 3 Big Banks

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN

 BODY:
The crisis in overseas financial markets was again felt in the United States yesterday, as three of the nation's largest banks said fourth-quarter earnings were hurt by sharp economic downturns in Asia and Latin America.
J. P. Morgan & Company, which said profit in the quarter plunged 35.3 percent on lower trading and underwriting revenues, suffered the heaviest damage. Most glaringly, and perhaps a harbinger of further pain for banks in Asia, J. P. Morgan set aside $587 million to protect itself from potential losses on nonperforming transactions known as currency swaps, primarily involving South Korean, Thai and Indonesian companies. . 
 The Chase Manhattan Corporation's fourth-quarter earnings rose 5 percent and Citicorp's gained 7.4 percent, but both companies were battered abroad. Chase reported an overall trading loss of $78 million for the quarter, as losses on Latin American bonds outweighed strong foreign-exchange gains, and said it had less than $100 million in nonperforming Asian loans. Citicorp classified $281 million in emerging markets loans as nonperforming, of which $200 million was related to Asia, and said problems in Asia reduced pretax income by $250 million for the quarter.
Nonetheless, Chase and Citicorp turned in stronger performances on the whole than did J. P. Morgan, and the stock market recognized it. Chase's shares rose $1.6875 each, to $107.1875. Citicorp's shares fell 87.5 cents, to $119, and J. P. Morgan's share price dropped $1.625, to $105.25.
The earnings announcements preceded the arrival in New York today of a South Korean delegation to discuss the country's attempt to renegotiate at least $28 billion in short-term debt owed to international banks. J. P. Morgan, Chase and Citicorp have tried to convince South Korea to repackage a large portion of that debt as long-term bonds guaranteed by the Seoul Government, but the proposal has encountered strong antipathy from the South Koreans. Moreover, significant differences of opinion exist among American, Japanese and German banks about how to handle a debt repackaging -- further undermining the likelihood that the American proposal will be a blueprint for the negotiations.
Banks have agreed to extend payment on the loans, at least $6 billion of which are in technical default, until March 31.
Japanese and German banks are the two largest South Korean creditors and are interested in options that do not include enormous bond offerings by South Korea. The South Koreans themselves are concerned that using a big bond auction to repackage their debt could force them to pay punishing interest rates. But South Korea's pile of short-term loans has created a cash shortage that is strangling the local economy, and the country's negotiators do not have unlimited time.
As yet unspoken, but certainly a point of discussion, will be whether South Korea's creditors must swallow losses on loans in order to conclude an agreement and to deflate public criticism that aid to the country amounts to a bailout of lenders. In that regard, loans to Southeast Asia still haunt American banks, but much less so than their European and Japanese counterparts.
At the end of 1997, J. P. Morgan had $3.4 billion in combined loan, bond and derivatives exposure in South Korea; $1.1 billion in Thailand, and $900 million in Indonesia. Citicorp said it had $2.4 billion in South Korean loans, $500 million in Indonesia, $300 million in Thailand and $400 million in the Philippines at the end of 1997. Chase has yet to provide more detail about its Southeast Asian exposure, beyond saying it had $4 billion in South Korean loans at the end of last September.
J. P. Morgan reported fourth-quarter net income of $271 million, or $1.33 a diluted share, on revenue of $1.68 billion, compared with $419 million, or $2.04 a share, on revenue of $1.8 billion for the comparable period last year. Analysts had expected earnings of $1.57 a share, according to consensus estimates set by First Call, a company that tracks corporate earnings. For the year, the bank earned $1.465 billion on revenue of $7.22 billion, compared with $1.57 billion on revenue of $6.85 billion in 1996.
J. P. Morgan reported a $78 million drop in credit revenue for the quarter because of turmoil in Asia and a $54 million loss in its equities derivatives portfolio, which analysts said was unrelated to the bank's emerging markets business.
Citicorp had fourth-quarter profits of $1.06 billion, or $2.20 a share, on revenue of $6 billion, compared with $987 million, or $1.97 a share, on revenue of $5.74 billion, in last year's fourth quarter. Analysts had expected the bank to earn $2.18 a share. For the year, Citicorp earned $3.6 billion, or $7.33 a share, on revenue of $23.3 billion, compared with profits of $3.8 billion, or $7.43 a share, on revenue of $21.5 billion, in 1996.
Citicorp had an overall trading loss of $188 million in the quarter and classified $59 million in foreign currency derivatives as nonperforming. Citicorp also said profit from its consumer businesses in emerging markets was $107 million lower than a year earlier because of problems in Asia and Brazil. These problems were more than offset by gains in the company's other operations. Credit card profits worldwide were down, although that business appears to be stabilizing. Citicorp's chairman and chief executive, John S. Reed, said he was not currently interested in acquiring other American banks. The bank raised its dividend 5 cents a share.
While Citicorp does not break out earnings on a country-by-country basis, Mr. Reed said in an internal E-mail memo to employees that pretax earnings for Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines could be down considerably. Mr. Reed added that "it is not good news but it probably does not have serious long-term consequences."
Chase reported fourth-quarter profits of $874 million, or $1.89 a share, on revenue of $4.29 billion, compared with $836 million, or $1.88 a share, on revenue of $4.1 billion, in last year's quarter. Analysts expected earnings of $1.89 a share. For the year, Chase earned $3.53 billion, or $8.64 a share, on revenue of $17.67 billion, compared with profits of $2.24 billion, or $7.55 a share, on revenue of $16.43 billion in 1996.

The Perfect Doorman Is Made, Not Born

BYLINE: By Tracie Rozhon 

 BODY:
IT'S not easy being a doorman.
First, there are those pesky autograph seekers, trying to waylay a prestigious tenant as he makes his way through the throngs outside. 
 Then there is the workman having a heart attack on the lobby floor.
Then there is the pleasant but persistent visitor a tenant doesn't want to see -- whom the doorman has to get rid of, politely.
And there is a sleazy reporter, trying to trick the doorman into giving information on a tenant in the news.
Being a doorman is apparently such a tough and tricky job that the city's largest management company has produced a training video to help its workers learn to cope with these make-believe (but presumably realistic) challenges -- with poise, if, judging by the video, not always charm. (The company used real doormen, who are, if the truth be told, a bit wooden on camera but at least game.)
The video, matter-of-factly titled "Concierge and Doorman Training" and not for commercial release, was made by a security-video company on a modest budget: "low five figures," said Jim O'Connor, a senior vice president at the Insignia Residential Group, which produced the video.
Mr. O'Connor, who said he really "got a kick out of the whole thing," has shown the 20-minute video to doormen in all of Insignia's managed buildings in Manhattan, Westchester and New Jersey. The company's 2,000 doormen and concierges were also given a printed synopsis of the dos and don'ts of being a good doorman.
To complaints about autograph seekers, a doorman should nod his head sagely and say he'll try to stop them. For heart attacks and other maladies, he should dial 911. If unwanted visitors ask to wait in the lobby, he should just say no. With inquiring reporters, he should keep mum. (By the way, "doorman" is one of those titles that the gender police cannot fault; New York doormen are almost exclusively male.)
"You know, it's not the highest paid job in the world," Mr. O'Connor said, "and the labor pool is limited by economics. On top of that, you've got to have someone who's honest -- there are very thorough background checks -- and they also have to be congenial and intelligent."
It is a union job, and the turnover, especially among the younger doormen, is fairly high. "It's standing up for eight hours a day, dealing with all the action," Mr. O'Connor said. "Guests, deliveries, floods."
The video can be a revelation to watch, in that many New Yorkers have not observed their own doormen performing like the ones shown in it. Besides fending off autograph seekers (the elegant "actor" with a German accent is actually the board president of a building near the United Nations, Mr. O'Connor said), the video's doormen are eternally vigilant about taxis: the men run out of the building every time one pulls up. In this video, the doormen also wheel out elaborate brass clothing racks on which to hang their tenants' expensive leather suit carriers, as they alight from limousines.
"It's true -- we do have guys who do that," Mr. O'Connor said. "Not all of them do it, but they're supposed to. Now, at least they know they're supposed to."
Gus Bevona, the president of Local 32B-32JT of the Service Employees International Union -- which has 65,000 members, including doormen, janitors and maintenance men -- could not be reached for comment, despite several attempts.
But Steven Steinberg, the president of the co-op board at 60 Gramercy Park -- and not a customer of Insignia -- was outspoken about the need for doormen who do exactly what the video portrays them as doing.
"All buildings pay the same rate to doormen because they're in the union -- did you know that?" he asked. "What we're looking for, especially in Gramercy Park, since we have to compete against Park Avenue, is a Park Avenue-type of doorman: an old-fashioned kind of guy who can't wait to help."
"Somebody who leaps to hold the elevator door open for tenants," he continued, "and out of the corner of his eye sees a taxi pulling up with somebody with lots of packages. Someone who will leap -- leaping is part of the doorman Olympics -- to help."
Mr. Steinberg said his building had hired such a person about a year ago. "He's young," he said. "He's articulate. He wants to help. If I could clone him I would. I'd put him up against any doorman in the city."
The problem, he said, is keeping this paragon down on Gramercy Park.
"The downtown doormen may not get as many tips at Christmastime as the uptown doormen," he explained.
Then there is the problem of doormen at the other end of the scale, those who are not so great, and yet are extremely difficult to dismiss.
"If you have a real clunker, you're stuck with him forever," Mr. Steinberg said. He confided that he had visited a Greenwich Village apartment building and was shocked by the poor attitude of the doorman.
"He was indifferent," the board president said. "He's got his little dustpan out, and he didn't care less whether we're coming or going."
Mr. Steinberg called the doorman training video "a brilliant idea," and asked if it was available for viewing. Perhaps, he said, he would suggest his building's managing agent make its own instruction tape. "Or maybe we could ask somebody to pirate a copy," he added.
But Mr. O'Connor was incredulous. "Whattaya, kidding?" he asked. "This is not Blockbuster Video. We don't lend these things out. This is our secret weapon. This is war!"

The Private Life of Club Chairs

BYLINE: By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
THINK of what Freud could have done with a leather club chair instead of a couch. People might have discovered they liked themselves. Had a drink or read a book instead of regressing. Sunk into something other than despair.
Because a leather club chair is like a memory -- a supple, not a suppressed one. It remembers everyone who's ever sat in it, in the lines of its face, the oils of its skin. No father figure like the sofa, the leather club chair is more like an uncle. Happy, a little worse for wear. The one who stays with you a lot. The kids love him. 
 So buying a leather club chair is more of a family matter. You are, if expensively, adopting it. And it is adopting you.
But like mixing friendship and money, it's not that simple. It may look all shrugs, like your first baseball glove, but a leather club chair is an adult luxury. Prices easily hit $2,000. Consumers seem increasingly game, and stores are obliging, with new models appearing in many collections.
"Leather is hot right now," said Kimberly Pfaff, the editor of High Points, a furniture trade magazine.
Mitchell Gold, whose company sold more than 5,000 leather club chairs over the last holiday season, said, "It's become one of the few impulse buys in the industry." The comfortable club chair has provided a sexier lounge-culture alternative to the lounger, especially for baby boomers who are aging but refuse to let recliners into the house.
The House & Home Section asked Tim Gleason, a decorative arts dealer and curator who is also a furniture maker and leather craftsman, to accompany us to a dozen stores in New York City that stock leather club chairs and to help get a good handle on the issues involved in buying one.
Mr. Gleason has 10 years' experience repairing and restoring furniture, especially Gustav Stickley pieces, many with leather upholstery; he also put in a brief stint at Hermes in New York.
What, in Mr. Gleason's opinion, should one look for? "The very first decision is esthetic -- what pulls you to the chair," he said. "A leather club chair should do a little more than just suit you -- it should be something you get a little excited about." And in fact at the end of the day's shopping, the most obvious lesson was this: Despite the leather club chair's familiarity in the mind, none of those seen were the same.
"Then the comfort," Mr. Gleason continued. "Those are the two most important things: does it look good and does it feel good?" Spend quality time with it, he advised, "because it's going to be around for a long time."
"The first thing you do when you get into a leather club chair -- you sit down and grab the arms, to feel the leather." he said. "Is there a nice spring and softness to it?"
Enjoy the touch of the skin. Then get under it. Mr. Gleason's quick all-points, primary-attack plan was illustrated in our first encounter at Portico Bed and Bath on Spring Street. After a leisurely professional sit, he got up and flipped the club chair over like a martial artist.
"From the bottom, you can see whether there are springs involved," Mr. Gleason said from underneath.
Ideally, a club chair's body will have some kind of padded spring construction, typically in the seat, more rarely in the back and arms. Traditional springs are upright coils, tied to provide a floating "ride" of independent but coordinated support. Horizontally spiraled coils that web the seat's frame, sometimes called sinuous or no-sag springs, are a newer, less expensive and less responsive alternative. The Portico club chair had sinuous springs.
Mr. Gleason righted the chair.
"The next thing is to pop the cushion up and see what's there," he said, reading a large white tag sewn to the seat that gives details of what the body and cushion are made of.
Body padding will usually be foam or a fiber fill. The best chairs employ horsehair or boar bristle, a stiffer, more durable batting. The seat cushion will be filled with foam, fiber, down or feathers.
The tags won't identify the frame's wood -- be sure to ask. The frame should be a hardwood, like ash or maple. With soft woods, joints will weaken quickly with use.
Mr. Gleason pushed on all crucial platforms of support -- the seat, the arms and the back -- to determine the construction. Typically for a midpriced chair, Portico's club chair had no springs in the back or arms. Also typical were the hardwood frame padded with foam wrapped in polyester fiber, and the foam seat cushion.
Because of its rounded, balloon-like shape, created largely with foam-padded framing, Mr. Gleason found it "fluffy," a comfortable but unsupportive sit. It is a style of seating preferred by some but a decision best made by the seat of your pants.
"I think a really good, comfortable chair that invites you to spend time in it is a combination of hard and soft," Mr. Gleason said.
Construction established, Mr. Gleason returned to the leather.
Depending on the hide's quality, processing and finishing, leather will have its original character -- or not. And it will be capable of aging -- or not. Regardless of grade or treatment, a chair's leather should be soft, silky and natural to the touch, with a good, clean leather smell.
Furniture sales tags will usually identify the upholstery as full-grain or top-grain leather. All upholstery leather is the top layer of a cowhide. Full-grain leather is the best quality. It is a skin used with its natural grain and it will display natural character in such things as pores and pocks, but not large imperfections like cattle brands. It is a connoisseur's leather. "The more they let you see, the better it is," Mr. Gleason said.
Next on the scale, top-grain leather is also the top of the hide, but not top of the line. Surface imperfections are corrected by sanding the hide and re-embossing a grain into it.
"When you think there's a beautiful grain pattern, 80 percent of the time it's been sanded and embossed to hide irregularities, so more of the hide can be used," Mr. Gleason said.
Industrial tanning methods that preserve and soften the hide -- now primarily the chromium salt process -- will produce a supple, durable leather from both grades. But be aware: The more perfect a leather looks, the more it may have been processed. Top-grain should be less expensive than full-grain leather, which is largely uncorrected.
Processing removes color, oils and moisture from the hide -- the leather's natural glow -- and these are replaced by dyeing and finishing. Some techniques encourage the look of age, some discourage it. This is where buyers' choices enter.
With each chair, Mr. Gleason employed two simple tests -- a pinch and a scratch -- to establish how each skin had been treated, and how it would show its wear.
Aniline dyeing creates uniform color through the hide. A small pinch of the skin won't produce a highlight that reads as a mark of age.
Modern club chair designs in solid colors, like Poltrona Frau's bright-red, Italian Art Deco-style Vanity Fair visited at its showroom on Wooster Street, benefit from this kind of insurance against time. Few love an old red chair.
But aniline dyeing seems less desirable for traditional brown-leather club chairs that may regret eternal youth: they will age like Dorian Gray, ever adolescent.
When age is a virtue, surface dyes help create it with a finish that will crease a lighter color. A pinch will prove this: the skin beneath will show white. Oil-treated hides, like the leather on the Biarritz chair at Wolfman, Gold and Good Company on Mercer Street, encourage this.
After the pinch test, Mr. Gleason lightly scratched each chair's leather with his finger, again demonstrating that the dye was on the surface. "You'll have a nice patina after a while, on the arms, the back," he said. "The oil will help it simulate an older chair more immediately."
Antiquing treatments are either machine-rubbed into the leather before upholstering or hand-rubbed into the chair afterward, which is preferable. In the William Alan club chair at ABC Carpet and Home, the chair's hand-rubbed antiquing looked integral to the piece, with the seams and piping a deeper shade.
The best leathers are vegetable-tanned in gentler oak-bark solutions then piece-rubbed with dye and oil. The result is a fine "hand," as leather workers like Mr. Gleason call it -- a touch that will develop character naturally with use over time. You'll also feel the rub in the price. Mr. Gleason found a good example in black leather at George Smith on Spring Street, at $5,130.
"It hasn't been embossed," Mr. Gleason said. "You're already seeing a natural cracking, which you wouldn't see with a chromium-tanned leather."
In some cases, design helped execute economy. Because large unblemished hides are relatively rare -- and correspondingly expensive -- leather piecework from less expensive hides cut costs in several chairs. The Pottery Barn Manhattan club chair and the Crate and Barrel Barclay club chair have backs made from three panels, rather than one.
Mr. Gleason advised considering preferences in style as decisions about comfort. Do you like the racing acceleration of a little club chair with a low rear, big fender arms and a throw-back tilt, like the small sporty chairs of the 1930's? Or do you like the lanky-legged tall parson's seat of the English club chair, with its confident spread-scroll arms?
The final decision will come down to the two of you. Measure your size against the chair, and measure the chair against your room. If you fall in love with your club chair it's not going to be living alone.
 
AN EXPERT SHOPS
A Guide to New York's Club Scene
 
If you're buying a leather club chair in the midrange -- $1,500 to $2,000 -- expect trade-offs between fine leather quality and great construction. But most of the chairs Tim Gleason appraised nicely balanced the two. Below, a sampling from stores around Manhattan.
 
ABC Carpet and Home 888 Broadway; 473-3000
SLIM JIM'S FRENCH SMOKING CHAIR -- $2,495
40 inches wide, 39 deep, 31 high
PROS -- Full-grain leather; nice, natural-grain character; hand-rubbed, antique finish. The seat is comfortably deep, with eight-way, hand-tied, coil spring construction.
CONS -- Enormous scale could make it overwhelming for smaller rooms -- and people. Fluffy feel, not as firm as others for sitting over longer periods of time.
 
Crate and Barrel
650 Madison Ave.; 308-0011
BARCLAY -- $1,699
32 inches wide, 38 deep, 36 high
PROS -- Oiled and waxed top-grain leather has a subtle antique look that will age gracefully. Clean, simple, versatile lines. The chair is small in scale, but deep in the seat.
CONS -- Lacks the cantilever of the classic, low roadster-style chairs that produces satisfying club "sink." Back uses sinuous, not coil, springs.
 
Foremost Furniture
8 West 30th St.; 889-6347
CLUB CHAIR -- $800
33 inches wide, 37 1/2 deep, 34 1/2 high
PROS -- Cost: the least expensive full-leather chair in the survey; leather is a good-grade top grain; oiled finish; spring seat.
CONS -- Foam seat cushion is not removable. Body is 85 percent foam. Leather is small piecework, some unevenly spaced.
 
Ethan Allen
192 Lexington Ave.; 213-0600
PAPER CLIP -- $1,449
36 inches wide, 35 deep, 38 high
PROS -- Top-grain leather with velvet touch; burnishing masks imperfections. Classic Art Deco shape, good proportion.
CONS -- Because of burnishing, leather will not visibly age. High in the seat. Springless foam back and cushion are extremely soft.
 
Ralph Lauren
867 Madison Ave.; 606-2100
TUXEDO -- $3,455
40 inches wide, 35 deep, 32 high
PROS -- Supple saddle leather with waxed finish; soft, satisfying touch; a look that will age well. Down and foam seat; hand-tied coil seat springs supply compensating firmness beneath. Padded back has springs.
CONS -- Rectilinear design offers hard arms of flat foam padding over a wood frame. Chair is striking, but too massive for most apartments.
 
Palazetti
515 Madison Ave.; 832-1199
CLUB CHAIR 611 -- $2,510
35 1/2 inches wide, 33 deep, 31 1/2 high
PROS -- Top-grain leather, one of the best available. Design is a near replica of the famous Jean-Michel Frank club chair.
CONS -- Foam; no springs anywhere. Piping can be sloppy, which is especially unfortunate in a clean-line design.
 
Poltrona Frau
141 Wooster St.; 777-7592
VANITY FAIR -- $3,779
37 inches wide, 36 deep, 39 high
PROS -- Aniline dye on full-grain leather will show little wear, appropriate for the streamlined 1930 Italian design. Full-spring construction in the seat, arms and back is a mark of high quality.
CONS -- The chair will age, though the leather won't. Seat doesn't tilt back invitingly.
 
Portico Bed and Bath
139 Spring St.; 941-7722
CLUB CHAIR -- $1,740
36 inches wide, 34 deep, 33 1/2 high
PROS -- Full-grain leather is sturdy. Cartoonlike Art Deco shape, good backward tilt, low seat and small scale make it a classic club for sitting; versatile in tight spaces.
CONS -- The aniline-dyed leather won't mellow or age. Lacks back springs, so feels unsupportive for long lounging.
 
George Smith
73 Spring St.; 226-4747
STANDARD CHAIR -- $5,130
32 inches wide, 40 deep, 34 high
PROS -- Top-grain, vegetable-tanned leather shows the natural grain; hand-rubbed dye will make for beautiful aging. Down cushion fits under back of the chair. Full, hand-tied springs in seat and back.
CONS -- It is a luxury item; it is luxuriously priced. No springs in the scroll arms.
 
Wolfman, Gold and Good
117 Mercer St.; 431-1888
BIARRITZ -- $1,599
37 inches wide, 39 deep, 33 high
PROS -- The oiled finish will scar attractively, producing a nice patina. Silhouette is sharper than the classic balloon chair, with nice details. Good proportions for a deep sit-down.
CONS -- Piecework on arms and back is necessary at this price, but chair lacks the flair of a full-skin club chair. Uses sinuous, not coil,
springs.
 
Giving a Vintage Club Chair a 100,000-Mile Checkup
 STORES like ABC Carpet and Home stock old club chairs, usually French from the 1920's, 30's and 40's. A chair's condition can add or subtract $1,000 on the sales tag. But a cheaper chair in worse condition is not a clever economy. It can't be re-upholstered -- the hide is the point. And the leather can't be repaired. Search for good examples.
"If the leather tears on an old chair, you've got a very expensive frame," said Tim Gleason, a furniture maker and leather craftsman. The frame is usually impossible to fix, as well: you would need to remove the leather to get to it.
Mr. Gleason recommended giving a chair a point-by-point physical exam. "Grab the arms to see if they wobble away from the seat," he said. "Shake the back, too, to make sure there are no broken boards."
Flex the springs in the arms, back and seat, then study the leather inch by inch. "Look everywhere there is flexing -- anywhere you have movement you have cracks with age," Mr. Gleason added. Deep cracks are unrepairable. Examine the seams, too: remember, leather weakens around repairs.
Flaking means the hide is sheepskin (right above). "There is a layer of fat between the top and bottom of sheepskin," Mr. Gleason explained. "When it dries, the top flakes off." What remains is trouble: a weak, suedelike skin. Seat cushions are sometimes antiqued replacements, which Mr. Gleason considers an acceptable fix. A pull at newly antiqued piping (right) will reveal whiter leather underneath. WILLIAM L. HAMILTON

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Salmon eaters salute a victory against the protectionists.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
THANKS to hard-charging Chilean exporters, fresh salmon -- in particular, the bone-free fillets ready for the broiler -- has become a major bargain. Check that: much of the thanks must go to lobbies for wholesale fish distributors and restaurants here in America.
For at considerable cost they have beaten back efforts by the domestic salmon industry to use the nation's trade laws to bar the foreign competition. Indeed, optimists in the free-trade crowd see a glimmer of hope that consumers will more routinely benefit from organized resistance to laws designed for protectionists. "We may be witnessing the emergence of an anti-anti-dumping coalition," suggested Greg Rushford, editor of The Rushford Report, a Washngton-based newsletter. 
 With the world's supplies of "free range" salmon badly depleted by overfishing, large-scale commercial salmon farming in tidal pools has come of age. Salmon are raised in, among other places, Norway, Scotland and America. But Chile is the market leader owing to a combination of ideal water conditions, low-cost labor and entrepreneurs quick to incorporate both new technology and modern advertising. Chilean exports to the United States skyrocketed from nearly nothing in the late 1980's to 70 million pounds in 1996 -- almost half the market for farmed salmon.
Not surprisingly, prices have fallen sharply, which accounts for the presence of salmon fillets in more supermarkets and on far more menus in midpriced restaurants. And while the domestic salmon industry, based in Maine and Washington, has remained profitable, it would be more profitable without all that low-cost Chilean fish flooding the market. So last year a coalition of eight American salmon farmers with a total of 440 employees hired Michael Coursey, the Washington-based lawyer who succeeded in knocking Norwegian salmon out of the market in 1990 by charging the Norwegians with selling below cost.
In light of the dreary history of both subsidy and dumping -- or selling below cost -- cases over the last two decades, it seemed the Chileans and those who enjoy their fish didn't have a prayer. "The trade laws are written to protect domestic producers," reminds Robert Litan, director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution. "Consumers' interests don't figure in the equation."
In fact, those $5.95-a-pound supermarket specials on salmon fillets are likely to be around a while longer. The subsidy charge has effectively been rejected and the preliminary anti-dumping duties assessed by the Commerce Department average just 5 percent -- a far cry from the 42 percent asked by the plaintiffs, and not nearly enough to send the Chileans packing.
It's possible that the Commerce Department simply overcame its loathing for everything imported and judged the Chilean case on the merits. But if you believe that, you might want to invest in Princess Di commemorative ceramics before the factory runs out of clay.
A more plausible explanation is that importers fought back with weapons that work. Atlas Air Inc., a cargo shipper that handles millions of pounds of Chilean salmon, hired Bob Dole's lobbying firm to make the case for importing tasty fish at reasonable prices. An alliance of importers in South Florida commissioned an economic consulting firm that came up with the preposterous (but eye-catching) estimate that 19,000 American jobs -- including 3,600 in Florida -- depended on easy Chilean access to the salmon market. And the National Restaurant Association weighed in with a shove at Congress and the Clinton Administration.
In a better world, Mr. Litan argues, there would be virtually no laws specifically aimed at regulating imports. The consumer-oriented antitrust laws, which prohibit restraint of trade and outlaw sales below cost with the intent of bankrupting competitors, would apply to foreign companies the way they now apply to domestic ones.
But foreigners don't vote in Congressional elections, and their efforts to buy favor with campaign contributions the way their American counterparts do is widely seen as a no-no. By the same token, large American exporters, who after World War II stood as a bulwark against protectionism, have lost their enthusiasm for open trade now that they have lost their commanding lead in technology. Many -- including Kodak and Boeing -- play both sides of the protectionist fence. And not surprisingly, "the Commerce Department views corporations that compete with imports as its real constituency," argued Ronald Cass, dean of the Boston University School of Law.
Hence from Mr. Cass's perspective, the best hope for consumers is a convergence of interest with businesses that depend on imports. To date, very few companies, with the notable exception of Caterpillar Industries, which lobbies hard for access to imported steel, have put in the political effort. But the success of the Salmon Trade Alliance (http://www.salmontrade.com) may just prove to be catching.

HEADLINE: $1.4 Billion Boeing Charge to Force First Yearly Loss Since '47

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
The Boeing Company, compounding one of its worst annual financial performances in 50 years, said yesterday that it would take a $1.4 billion pretax charge against its earnings for the fourth quarter of 1997 related to its merger with the McDonnell Douglas Corporation.
The charge, which was widely expected, was slightly higher than what was anticipated by investors and analysts and will result in Boeing's first annual loss since 1947. 
 Combined with $2.6 billion in charges announced by the company in October, Boeing has effectively written off about half of its shareholder equity, or assets minus liabilities, in the last three months as it has struggled with production problems in the manufacture of its flagship commercial jets.
But investors and analysts were optimistic in the wake of yesterday's announcement, saying they thought that Boeing was on the mend and that management was putting the worst behind it so that the company could improve its performance this year.
Indeed, Philip Condit, Boeing's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement yesterday that the company's fourth-quarter operating results would be in line with Wall Streets earnings estimates when the company reports them next week.
"The attitude that is emerging is: 'We know you are going to have a sloppy quarter, so make it as sloppy as you can so '98 will look better,' " said Byron K. Callan, an aerospace industry analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company in New York.
On a day when many large companies saw their share prices fall, Boeing's stock rose 50 cents yesterday, to $44, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Still, Boeing stock is trading well below its 52-week high of $60.50, set last July, when the company was basking in the success of record orders for its passenger jets. That performance turned bittersweet in the fall when the company was forced to shut down its 747 and 737 lines for a month because it could not handle the steep increase in production.
Analysts lowered their earnings estimates in October after Boeing announced that the production problems would cost the company $2.6 billion through the end of 1998. Estimates fell further more recently as fears have grown that airlines in Asia, which are some of Boeing's biggest customers, will cancel orders because of the economic turmoil there.
After completing its purchase of McDonnell Douglas for more than $16 billion last August, Boeing announced in November that it would stop making that company's MD-80 and MD-90 passenger jets after next year. Yesterday's charge reflected the costs and loss of value related to closing down the two production lines. Included are financial obligations Boeing owes McDonnell Douglas customers because the residual value of existing models of the two planes will decline once they are no longer in production.
Boeing has said that it will continue to produce McDonnell's three-engine MD-11 jet, marketing it mostly as a cargo plane, and the new 100-seat MD-95 regional jet, which it recently renamed the Boeing 717.
After taxes, the $1.4 billion charge will equal about 91 cents a share. On an operating basis, Boeing is expected to earn 32 cents a share for the quarter and 69 cents a share for the year, according to the average estimate of analysts surveyed by I.B.E.S. International Inc., which tracks corporate earnings projections.

HEADLINE: Abortion Rights, 25 Years Later

 BODY:
A quarter-century after the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade, the right of women to control their reproductive lives remains central to their ability to participate fully in America's economic, social and cultural life. Yet a woman's right to choose abortion before a fetus becomes viable remains as embattled as ever. The current campaign in Congress and within the Republican Party against so-called partial birth abortions, most of which occur before viability, is only the latest blow against abortion rights. The past 25 years of litigation, clinic bombings and political struggle have taken a grievous toll.
Abortion opponents have made significant strides since 1973. For millions of women, particularly those who are poor or young or live in rural areas, the right to choose is increasingly hollow. Only 17 states have Medicaid-type funding for poor women seeking abortions in cases other than rape or incest or when the life of the woman is endangered. The 1992 Supreme Court decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, while reaffirming the general right to abortion under Roe, diminished the right by opening the door to greater government intrusion before fetal viability. Since then, dozens of states have passed laws creating waiting periods, requiring parental consent or notification, and banning certain types of abortion procedures. 
 These restrictions, coupled with anti-abortion violence and fewer doctors being trained and willing to provide abortions, have reduced access to the procedure everywhere. There is no abortion provider in 84 percent of counties in the country. Between 1982 and 1992 the number of providers dropped in 45 states. North and South Dakota have only one abortion provider each. If these trends continue, legal, safe abortion will cease to be available in some parts of the country. The nation may be headed back to pre-Roe times, when abortion access differed from state to state.
Despite efforts to dismantle Roe, most Americans support legalized abortion. In a recent New York Times/CBS News Poll, 60 percent of respondents said they believed that the Roe decision establishing a constitutional right to obtain a legal abortion is a good thing. Fifty-nine percent said government should stay out of abortion decisions, and 76 percent oppose a constitutional amendment to make abortions illegal. But the anti-abortion advocates are making inroads. The poll found that only 15 percent support legal abortion in the second trimester, part of the period protected by Roe.
The wisdom of Roe is that it placed the abortion decision in the hands of women and their doctors before viability. That remains a principle around which most Americans can rally. The challenge now is to defend that principle as a new generation comes of age that is too young to remember a time when women died or were maimed as a result of illegal abortions.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Treasury Prices Gain, With 30-Year Bond Set to Yield 5.81

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices gained yesterday after a slumping stock market helped erase early losses.
The price of the 30-year bond rose 14/32, to 104 14/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.81 percent, from 5.84 percent on Tuesday. 
 Bonds fell early in the session after a Commerce Department report showed an unexpected shrinking of the United States trade deficit. The November trade gap fell to $8.037 billion from October's revised $9.091 billion. Falling oil prices and weaker demand for petroleum held down imports, offsetting a drop in exports to Asia. The data raised concerns in the bond market that the gross domestic product report may show the economy grew 4 percent in the fourth quarter, a figure that some feel would prevent the Federal Reserve from easing interest rates anytime soon.
Another report yesterday, a regional survey by the Fed known as the beige book, had little impact on the market.
Jack Ablin, president of Barnett Capital Advisors Inc. in Jacksonville, Fla., said the strength in the government bond market could be traced to the Asian market weakness and the Fed, which has effectively written off inflation this year.
"The stock market should be doing better, Mr. Ablin said, "but every time the Asian stories begin to percolate, the stock market takes a hit and bonds rally. I think the stock market should be doing better and bonds should be lower than they are today."
While the Treasury market drew buyers as stocks slumped, bond prices came under pressure as some market participants sold to hedge large issues of corporate and municipal debt being priced. Securities firms involved in such debt offerings typically sell Treasury securities as a hedge until the deals are done.
In the municipal market, the New York State Dormitory Authority tentatively priced the largest municipal bond deal of the new year, $718.3 million of mortgage hospital revenue bonds for Presbyterian Hospital through underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs & Company. The deal is priced with a maximum yield of 5.17 percent for a bond due in 2032. The bonds are insured by the Federal Housing Administration and Ambac Indemnity for a triple-A rating by Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's. Presbyterian Hospital is Columbia University's teaching hospital.
Israel priced $1.4 billion of zero- coupon bonds yesterday through Lehman Brothers, which had won the deal in competitive bidding the day before.
The bonds, which mature semi-annually from 2002 to 2027, were issued through the United States Agency for International Development. Sold at discount, the zero-coupon bonds make no scheduled interest rate payments but if held to maturity will pay investors the full face value.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Chip Maker's Operating Net Is Up Sharply

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON 

DATELINE: DALLAS, Jan. 21

 BODY:
Texas Instruments reported a healthy jump in operating earnings today despite fading orders at the end of the year resulting from Asia's economic turmoil. And despite predicting a slow first quarter, the company issued a bright outlook for the year.
For the fourth quarter, Texas Instruments, based here, reported operating earnings of $219 million, or 55 cents a diluted share, from continuing businesses, up sharply from $95 million, or 25 cents a diluted share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected 59 cents a share, and shares of Texas Instruments initially fell on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 The company, however, told analysts in a conference call that its sales of digital signal processors would grow more than 30 percent this year, and the shares rebounded to close up $1.75, or 3.8 percent, at $48. Digital signal processors, which are found in cellular telephones, modems, disk drives and other digital products, have specialized capabilities useful for communications.
After a number of one-time charges, Texas Instruments reported a loss of $285 million, or 73 cents a diluted share, compared with a loss of $29 million, or 8 cents a diluted share, a year earlier. The charges included a $461 million write-off in the acquisition of Amati Communications. Amati's technology allows modems containing the sorts of chips Texas Instruments makes to speed the transmission of data.
Many analysts came around to the view that the company's transformation from a maker of commodity memory chips and other low-margin goods into a producer of digital signal processors and other more specialized chips is on course. "Their outlook was O.K.," said Caroline Gangi, an analyst with Lehman Brothers. "More and more of their products are proprietary."
The company's quarterly revenue fell to slightly more than $2.4 billion, reflecting the sale of software and laptop computer businesses.
For the global chip industry, Texas Instruments predicted sales growth of 10 percent this year, tepid but still hotter than last year's 5 percent. The slow growth has been a result in large part of low prices for memory chips.
Thomas P. Kurlak, an analyst with Merrill Lynch, foresees industrywide gloom. "The company and the industry are slowing down," he said. "I don't see any momentum." At Texas Instruments, he said, low memory chip prices would hurt more than growing digital signal processor demand would help.
While low memory chip prices continue to afflict the company, by last year, digital signal processors and related devices accounted for 45 percent of its semiconductor sales. William A. Aylesworth, the company's chief financial officer, said that Texas Instruments would outstrip this year's expected 30 percent global sales growth in digital signal processors.
Texas Instruments saw some customers cut back orders as Asia's economic crisis spread, causing the company to remain cautious over the near term. But for the year as a whole, the company remains sufficiently optimistic to invest $1.3 billion, up from $1.1 billion, in research and development.

HEADLINE: Sybase Loss to Grow as Sales Are Disputed

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 21

 BODY:
Sybase Inc. said today that it had discovered inappropriate accounting for sales by its Japanese subsidiary, forcing the company to postpone release of its fourth-quarter financial results for one week, and to revise results for the quarter and year.
Sybase, a provider of data-base management software, said the people responsible had either resigned or been dismissed. 
 Earlier this month, Sybase had cautioned analysts that results would fall below expectations, and that it anticipated a small net loss, which it attributed to poor performance in the North American market and economic weakness in Asia. The revision means that Sybase will report a much larger loss for the fourth quarter.
Sybase estimated that the amount of the disputed sales was $60 million to $65 million, and said the recent disclosure would require a restatement for the first three quarters. Earlier, the company, which is based in Emeryville, Calif., had said it expected fourth-quarter revenues of $245 million to $250 million, with earnings per share ranging from a loss of 7 cents to a profit of 2 cents.
"You're talking about more than 5 percent of their revenues going away, and a higher percentage of license fees," said Curt A. Monash, publisher of the Monash Software Letter. "This is a significant, but not crippling, loss of revenues."
Sybase made its announcement after the stock market closed. Earlier, Sybase shares closed at $9.6875, up 25 cents, in Nasdaq trading.
The announcement from Sybase, the second-largest data-base management software company, comes at a period of weakness in the market, with the market-leading Oracle Corporation reporting weaker-than-expected earnings and the Informix Corporation, No. 3 in the market, also facing financial difficulties. But analysts said Sybase's problems appeared to be primarily of the company's own making, and called into question the viability of the company's two-year-old turnaround effort.
"I keep thinking they're out of the woods, but then there's another setback," said James M. Pickrel, an analyst with Hambrecht & Quist. "This coming out, at a time when they were already perceived as weak, is just another wound inflicted. The restatement will take them to a substantial loss for 1997, and with the weakness in Japan and Asia, you have a dampening of the outlook for 1998."
Mitchell Kertzman, Sybase's chairman and chief executive, said the company's auditor, Ernst & Young, had found that the Japanese subsidiary, Sybase K. K., had closed some major sales by providing so-called side letters, which offered customers the ability to return software. Such provisions were in clear violation of the company's accounting standards, and had been covered up by the people responsible, including the Sybase K.K. president, Mr. Kertzman said. Names were not disclosed.
"There is zero chance they thought this was O.K.," Mr. Kertzman said. Though some percentage of the $60 to $65 million may be valid sales, there is no way to quantify that at this time, he said. "I think they thought the product would not come back, but they knew it was a violation of revenue recognition standards." Compounding the fraud, he added, was the fact that the executives did not disclose the existence of the side letters until they were confronted.
In the past, both Informix and Oracle have had to restate revenues to reflect questionable sales, and Sybase has indulged in some aggressive practices itself. But Mr. Kertzman said his company has tried hard to maintain more conservative standards since he took over as chief executive in 1996. "It's an industry that has been run much more on testosterone than on common sense," he said. "The thing that hurts me is we've been trying to put a stop to that for the last couple of years."

HEADLINE: Eastern Europeans Keep Ex-U.S. Spies in the Cold

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: BUDAPEST, Jan. 17

 BODY:
Mihaly Bencsik had been on the inside of the Soviet Union's Communist Party apparatus, and by the time he walked into an apartment building near an American military base in Munich in 1981, he was ready to tell what he knew.
Mr. Bencsik (pronounced BEN-chick), then a disaffected 41-year-old Hungarian who had worked in Moscow as a trusted translator, told his American questioner how the Soviets sapped his country's economy and where troops were based near his home in eastern Hungary. 
 When he returned home after five weeks of meetings with "John," whom he understood to be a NATO officer and who American officials say was probably a member of the United States Army 69th Intelligence Unit, then based in Munich, Mr. Bencsik was arrested. He was convicted of espionage and sentenced to six years in prison.
Now, with Hungary expected to join NATO next year, Mr. Bencsik, 60, a polite but broken man, still lives under a cloud, his legal appeals for rehabilitation and a decent pension denied.
There are others like him -- in Hungary, and in Poland, which is also in line to join NATO -- who gave the United States information in its fight against Communism but who now find themselves out in the cold.
Their predicament is an unfinished piece of business as nations that were enemies become friends, and a philosophical quandary.
Some have argued, one diplomat said, that it was "not right" that people who helped in the American quest to undermine Communism remain slighted -- unable to vote, prevented from easily getting a job -- in their home countries.
But others argue, he said, that many Western countries would be as unforgiving toward spies, no matter how minor-league, as the new democracies in Central Europe are being. (Mr. Bencsik said he received 1,000 German marks in 1981.)
The anti-Communist governments that came to power in 1990 saw themselves as patriots first, and refused to pardon these spies.
In 1992 the right-of-center Government in Hungary passed a law that annulled all "political" crimes committed in the Communist era. But this law, according to Ferenc Koszeg, the chairman of the Helsinki Watch committee and a member of Parliament since 1990, specifically did not cover espionage.
Mr. Koszeg said he argued for pardons. But most anti-Communist members of Parliament believed that spying against Hungary during Communism was spying against the nation no matter what.
In Poland, the newly elected Government passed a law in 1990 that granted amnesties to those who were still in prison for espionage when the Communists fell. But the law did not cover those freed before 1990 after serving sentences for espionage, said Andrzej Rzeplinski, a law professor at Warsaw University. These people are "free but generally they are not rehabilitated," and retain criminal records for 10 years, he added.
In Poland, it took pressure from Washington for the Government to finally pardon last year the spy Ryszard Kuklinski, a Polish colonel who fled to Washington in 1981 with information about the plans for martial law. Colonel Kuklinski, who has remained in the United States, has been denied restitution of his property, as have several Polish diplomats who stayed in the West during the cold war.
For the small-time spies in Hungary -- they include a onetime disillusioned conscript and a former clerk in the Interior Ministry -- the spectacle of Hungary's joining NATO is bittersweet. They are dismayed, they say, that they remain shunned for having helped their country's new friends.
"Outwardly the Government is so enthusiastic about joining NATO, but domestically it is not clearing cases like mine," Mr. Bencsik, an elementary school teacher by training, said as he thumbed through a raft of court documents. Adding to Mr. Bencsik's sense of injustice is the fact that the current Government is led by former Communists, the very people who were in authority when he was jailed.
Three years ago Mr. Bencsik applied to Hungary's highest court to annul his sentence. The court turned him down. There is no appeal and no provision for a presidential pardon.
When he was released from prison in 1986 after serving a shortened sentence, Mr. Bencsik found it difficult to get a job because he was denied a "moral certificate" that former prisoners need in Hungary for their rights to be restored.
Returning to teaching was out of the question. He was able to wangle a laboring job at a granary after the foreman cleared it with the police. He will be allowed to vote in parliamentary elections for the first time this year.
But what is most at stake for Mr. Bencsik, whose early faith in Communism, his impeccable Russian and then his marriage to a Russian gave him extra access in Moscow, is a full pension and his honor.
Because of his criminal record, Mr. Bencsik said, he receives a pension of $100 a month instead of $300.
As for his honor, Mr. Bencsik said that when he came back from his short visit to West Germany in 1981 (he went to settle a financial matter with an acquaintance who had emigrated), he visited the head of the domestic intelligence agency in Budapest.
He had known the spy chief during his stint in Moscow and told his friend what he had told NATO.
"I was so honest because I was so sure the Soviet system was crumbling," Mr. Bencsik said. "I felt I had told how Hungary was suppressed. There couldn't even be a small arrangement in the Soviet Hungarian Peace Committee without its being approved by Moscow. I thought I was uncovering an injustice."
Soon after speaking to the spy chief, Mr. Bencsik was arrested in Nyiregyhaza, in eastern Hungary, where he lives. He was placed for four months in a solitary cell that was lighted around the clock, interrogated and convicted.
Mr. Koszeg, a former dissident, says that as a member of Parliament and lawyer, he is the last one to condone spying.
But in this situation, he said, perhaps the United States should ask the Hungarian Government as it enters NATO, "How is it possible you punish people who worked for us, while those of you who are in charge now worked against us?"

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Initially Backs Fidelity Plan to Insure Money Funds

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
The Securities and Exchange Commission has given preliminary approval to a plan allowing Fidelity Investments, the giant mutual fund company, to establish a mutual insurance company to guarantee its money market funds against some losses.
Fidelity's proposal calls for its money funds to share the cost of insuring against annual losses up to $100 million that are caused by a default by the issuer of a security that some or all of the funds own. 
 But the S.E.C.'s preliminary ruling places limits on how a mutual fund can publicize its insured status, partly because the insurance is unlikely to cover all of the fund's assets.
To set up the insurance company, the Fidelity funds need an exemption from certain sections of the Investment Company Act of 1940, the statute governing mutual funds. On Tuesday, the S.E.C. decided to give other fund companies and insurers until Feb. 16 to comment on the insurance plan. The agency released a copy of its order late yesterday.
After the comment period ends, the agency will render a final decision. An endorsement, which is not guaranteed and which depends in part on any comments the agency receives, usually follows preliminary approval.
A spokeswoman for Fidelity, which is part of the FMR Corporation, declined to comment on the S.E.C.'s action, saying the company had not yet received notification of a decision.
The Fidelity plan attracted great attention in the mutual fund industry in August 1996, when the Internal Revenue Service issued a tax ruling that made the insurance plan feasible. Since then, several established insurance companies said they would plan to begin selling similar coverage to other money market funds if the S.E.C. approved Fidelity's application.
Among those expected to enter the field is Marsh & McLennan, the parent of Putnam Investments, Fidelity's crosstown rival in Boston.
The attraction of such insurance is simple for money market funds: It would allow them to assure shareholders that their investments were at least partly protected against losses if the issuer of a security defaulted. As proposed by Fidelity, the insurance would not cover losses caused by changes in interest rates.
By setting up its own insurance company, Fidelity gains an advantage over fund companies that might go to outside insurers for coverage. Because Fidelity can spread the costs of the insurance over three dozen money market funds, the expense is less likely to cut into the return of any individual fund.
Even such a relatively tiny expense means a lot among money market funds. Their annual investor returns rarely differ by more than few tenths of a percentage point.
Fidelity's initial application calls for only its United States money market funds to take part in the insurance venture. But according to the proposal, other, non-money market funds might participate in the future to insure any money market assets they hold if their boards approve the move.
In addition, while the S.E.C.'s preliminary approval allows a "a brief description of the nature and extent of the insurance coverage" in a fund's prospectus, the approval states that a fund's insured status "will not be used in connection with the marketing or the sale of shares of the funds, and thus will not be discussed in any marketing or sales literature" distributed to prospective investors.
Money market insurance sounds appealing, but it is not necessarily a good deal for fund investors, industry analysts say. A fund's manager is never obligated to repurchase securities from a fund. But a fund company, by insuring itself against losses up to a certain dollar amount, could be signaling that it will not step in to bail out the fund from greater losses.
Several fund companies have completed such bailouts in recent years. When interest rates shot up in 1994, some aggressive money market funds were caught with derivatives that lost value as interest rates rose.
In most cases, the fund companies stepped in and bought back the troubled securities in order to keep each fund's net asset value from falling below the $1-a-share level, which all money market funds strive to maintain.
And last year, the manager of the Strong money market funds, based in Milwaukee, repurchased some securities issued by Mercury Finance, which was about to default.
In a speech to industry executives last May, Barry Barbash, the director of the S.E.C.'s division of investment management, which regulates mutual funds, chastised the executives on their willingness to bail money funds out of bad investments.
"What I find disconcerting about bailouts is that we and fund shareholders have come to expect them," Mr. Barbash said. That tendency, he said, created the perception among investors in the funds that was "inconsistent with their basic design as an investment with some risk."

HEADLINE: End Video Poker Gambling, South Carolina Chief Urges

BYLINE: By RICK BRAGG 

DATELINE: COLUMBIA, S.C., Jan. 21

 BODY:
To hear the Governor tell it, the very soul of South Carolina is at risk in a high-stakes game of video poker, which has resulted in everything from rampant gambling addiction to the death of a child.
The Governor, David M. Beasley, said a proliferation of video poker machines in restaurants, bars and truck stops has caused a collective misery, spawned a new generation of addicted gamblers and destroyed families. 
 He formally appealed to the South Carolina Legislature today to join his crusade to completely do away with the $2-billion-a-year business.
"Routinely, we are asked to decide between right and wrong," the Governor said in his State of the State address tonight. "This is such a time."
Video poker in South Carolina, largely unregulated and rife with abuses, contributes only a sliver of the state taxes -- about $62 million has been projected for this year -- that lawmakers and experts on the industry say it should.
But instead of pushing for tougher regulation and higher taxes -- as much as $250 million in a state budget that is now $5.4 billion -- Governor Beasley wants it banned.
In his address, mostly a glowing speech in which he spoke of South Carolina's solid economy and scenic beauty, he asked the Legislature first for a strong bill to curb sexual predators -- "rapists and pedophiles have no place in this society except behind lock and key" -- before calling for a ban on video poker in the next breath.
"There is another force that has free reign over our state, and it's not a force for good," he said.
Opponents of video poker say they are locked in a battle with the machines for the state's very soul.
"It's in the Bible that it's wrong," said the Rev. Harold Park, a retired Lutheran pastor in Chapin, S.C.
Mr. Beasley often tells the story of a 26-year-old woman whose baby died from dehydration in a sweltering car while she played video poker in Jasper County last summer. She played for seven hours without checking on the infant.
The woman, Sgt. Gail Baker of the Army, has been charged with homicide by child abuse, but her husband -- and the Governor -- said it was her addiction that killed the baby.
"I do not hold her responsible for that," her husband, Staff Sgt. Julius Baker of the Army, said in a recent appeal to the Legislature to ban video poker. "She has an addiction."
Tonight, before a joint session of the State House of Representatives and the State Senate, Governor Beasley shared other stories. He told of a 52-year-old woman in Newberry who wrote him saying that suicide was "the only escape from her mounting gambling debts -- she said she'd be dead today if her husband hadn't saved her from a drug overdose."
Four years ago, Gamblers Anonymous had eight chapters in South Carolina. By 1997, that number had grown to 27.
"It is an industry focused to prey on those least able to care for themselves, the addicted and the poor," said the Rev. L. Wayne Bryant, executive minister of the Christian Action Council, which has battled video poker for years.
In the gas stations and roadside arcades where people play the game, away from politics and religion, the issue is discussed much less dramatically.
"My stepfather used to gamble away his paycheck," said Jessica Williams, 21, who works at a Columbia gas station with five video poker machines along a back wall. There, a single player sat feeding $1 bills into a machine, losing, mostly.
"Me, I put a few dollars in, and if I don't win my money back I quit," said Ms. Williams. "It all depends on the person. But it is right there, convenient for you. If you do have an addiction, it's there for you."
It is the only legal gambling, outside bingo, that this Bible Belt state allows, a small-stakes exemption to community morals hidden discreetly -- at least in the past -- in the back rooms of service stations and country stores.
In 1980, when video poker machines first appeared, they were little more than an amusement for truckers. But it has grown so much that a hand of video blackjack is only a few minutes drive away from most South Carolinians. There are now all-night arcades featuring the glowing, slot machine-like poker dealers. Almost every convenience store seems to have one.
Fred Collins, 62, is the industry's strongest force in South Carolina. He pioneered the industry here, and has made millions from it. He owns one in seven video poker licenses, and has the most to lose.
"People don't want morals legislated to them," he said. He points to a 1994 vote in which 58 percent of the voters said they wanted video poker left alone.
Store owners say they would have to close without the money generated by video poker players, who are enticed into the stores by the machines and often spend money on other goods and services.
Some members of the Legislature -- where there seems to be no clear majority on the issue, one way or another -- say it would be more prudent to harness the tax windfall that a properly regulated and taxed industry could provide.
Owners of arcades and roadside casinos circumvent existing restrictions by almost comical means. State law forbids more than five machines in one room. Some store owners just partition off rooms and file for a separate business license.
Governor Beasley and others say the industry is too far gone to restructure.
To underscore the Governor's call for a ban on machines, his proposed budget does not even include money from video poker. "Don't regulate it," he told the legislators. "Don't tighten it. Ban it -- once and for all."
Opponents of the ban say the Governor, a 40-year-old Democrat-turned-Republican, is just trying to shore up support among religious leaders and appear to be a strong leader, an image that some political experts say was tarnished when he tried unsuccessfully more than a year ago to have the Confederate battle flag removed from the state Capitol, a move that split the state's Republicans.
The most powerful man in keeping the video machines is Mr. Collins, who convinced many in the Legislature to create the existing laws that allow the existence of video poker.
"They need to regulate the industry," and he has even called for higher taxes himself, he said. "But they'd rather attack something than go on and fix it."

HEADLINE: THE POPE IN CUBA: THE IMPLICATIONS;
Castro's Spin: Pope Is on Our Side

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: HAVANA, Jan. 21

 BODY:
To the rest of the world, the arrival of Pope John Paul II here today seems a direct challenge to Fidel Castro and everything he stands for. Inside Cuba, however, Mr. Castro is using every means at his disposal to convince his 11 million people that he and the beleaguered Cuban revolution he has led for nearly 40 years will be the ultimate beneficiaries of the visit.
Cubans have been told, for instance, that the Pope will vigorously condemn the American economic embargo -- but not that he will also speak out in support of human rights. The walls of many Government offices have been decorated with posters showing Mr. Castro and the Pope posed together at their meeting in Rome in 1996, accompanied by statements stressing their convergence of views on issues like the foreign debt, hunger, poverty and the environment. 
 "Holy Father, we feel the same way you do about many important issues of today's world," the Cuban leader said in his welcoming remarks at Jose Marti Airport this afternoon. "Another country will not be found better disposed to understand your felicitous idea -- as we understand it and so similar to what we preach -- that the equitable distribution of wealth and solidarity among men and peoples should be globalized."
In recent remarks, Mr. Castro has also characterized the Pope's visit as a triumph over efforts to isolate the only Communist Government in the Western Hemisphere and as a rare opportunity for Cuba to present itself in the best possible light to the international community.
"Billions of people around the world are going to be watching images of Cuba these days and reading news about Cuba," he told Cubans last weekend. "Nobody can change what is seen."
Conversely, Mr. Castro has argued that John Paul's visit constitutes a defeat for the United States. In his declarations on television on Friday night, which were reprinted in their entirety on Tuesday in Granma, the newspaper of the Cuban Communist Party, he contrasted the independent behavior of the Pope with that of other world leaders who, he maintained, have bowed to American pressure not to come to Cuba.
"They would like to have prohibited the visit of the Pope if they could," he said of Washington. "Because this Pope, with the cold war finally over, aware of the disaster that capitalism and the problems of corruption, pillaging and economic chaos have provoked in all those countries, based on the realities he has observed since then, has focused his efforts in another direction."
Anticipating just such a diplomatic offensive, the Clinton Administration took the unusual step of sending Michael E. Ranneberger, the State Department's coordinator of Cuban affairs, here and making him available to reporters. Peppered with questions about the morality and efficiency of the 37-year-old American economic embargo at a news conference this morning, Mr. Ranneberger repeatedly described the measure as only one element of a broader policy intended to induce "fundamental, systemic, democratic change in Cuba" and minimized the Vatican's opposition to economic sanctions as a disagreement between friends about means, not ends.
As always, Mr. Castro's actions have also sown division among his enemies among Cuban exiles in the United States. Fierce opposition to the papal visit among some exile groups in Miami led to the cancellation, on the grounds that the Pope's presence here would only legitimize Mr. Castro's dictatorship, of plans to sail a cruise ship full of Cuban-American pilgrims here for the visit. A burst of infighting over the issue is still going on among exiles.
By encouraging Cubans to turn out to see the Pope, and even authorizing days off with pay so they can do so, Mr. Castro has done more than just give his blessing to the visit. He also has created a situation, diplomats here pointed out, that allows him to take the credit if there is a huge turnout on Sunday at the Mass the Pope will celebrate at the Plaza of the Revolution, where Mr. Castro has over the years delivered speeches to crowds of a million people.
"Of course I'm going to attend," Ileana Acosta del Valle, a middle-aged store clerk here, responded today when asked about her plans for Sunday. "If the comandante is going to be there, why can't I also?"
Mr. Castro has been so adept in his efforts to co-opt the visit that it now appears to most Cubans almost as if he is sponsoring it. At a news conference here on Monday, Jaime Cardinal Ortega, who served a term in a labor camp in the mid 1960's, took pains to subtly remind journalists that the Pope was coming to Cuba at the behest of the Cuban church, not the state.
"The Pope has longed for this visit to Cuba," Cardinal Ortega said, adding that "in the end, that is what constitutes the purpose of the papal visit: to satisfy the invitation of the Cuban bishops" and also to meet the faithful of the church here so that he might "personally, in a direct manner, visit, animate and comfort them in their faith."
Mr. Castro's effort to stress similarities between his beliefs and those of the Catholic Church is not new, of course. "There is a great concurrence between Christianity's objectives and those we seek as Communists," he said in 1971 to a Christian group in Chile, "between the Christian teachings of humility, austerity, selflessness and loving thy neighbor and what we might call the content of a revolutionary's life and behavior."
Church officials predicted that Mr. Castro's efforts to identify himself with the Pope and his values will fail. The scars left by three decades of atheism as a policy of state, they said, and the persecution of Catholic clergy and lay people that followed from it, will not permit such a thing, they said.
"Fidel said that the Holy Father is someone who cannot be manipulated, and Fidel is right, as he will soon discover," a Bishop from a Latin American country who is here for the visit said today, adding:
"John Paul is going to deliver a very strong message about human liberty in all of its manifestations, just as he did when he went to Pinochet's Chile, Nicaragua under the Sandinistas or Brazil when it was ruled by the generals."

HEADLINE: Business Coalition to Fight Legislation Protecting Patients' Rights

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 21

 BODY:
Lobbyists for big business, small business and health insurance companies today unveiled a $1 million campaign to block bipartisan legislation intended to protect the rights of patients.
The lobbyists said such legislation, far from protecting patients, would increase the cost of health care and health insurance, so that many employers would cut back coverage. 
 President Clinton and lawmakers from both parties, led by Representative Charlie Norwood, Republican of Georgia, have been pushing a variety of proposals to help patients and regulate health plans, especially health maintenance organizations.
Many politicians contend that such legislation will prove irresistible in this election year. But a coalition of business groups said today that they would fight back, in an effort to kill any new Federal requirements that guarantee patients a choice of doctors or other rights.
The coalition includes the National Federation of Independent Business and the Health Insurance Association of America, which led efforts to kill Mr. Clinton's proposal for universal health insurance in 1994.
The new coalition also includes the United States Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, the Business Roundtable, which represents 200 of the nation's largest companies, and the American Association of Health Plans, which represents H.M.O.'s.
In a report today, the Congressional Budget Office predicted a resurgence of health care inflation, even without new requirements. And it said that "laws to protect health consumers could raise private premiums" even more, presumably by giving patients freer access to medical specialists and costly types of care.
Jack Faris, chief executive of the National Federation of Independent Business, said the coalition would spend at least $1 million on advertising in newspapers and magazines. One advertisement shows the head of Frankenstein's monster and admonishes Congress: "Be careful how you play doctor. You might mandate a monster." The coalition has no immediate plans to resurrect "Harry and Louise," the yuppie couple who starred in television advertisements lampooning the Clinton health plan in 1994.
In a new survey of public opinion, researchers from the Kaiser Family Foundation and Harvard University found that substantial majorities of Americans favored the patients' "bill of rights" proposed by the President and members of Congress. But fewer people said they would support such legislation if it caused increases in insurance premiums or prompted some employers to drop coverage.
Legislative proposals to regulate managed care have divided Republicans. More than 90 House Republicans support Mr. Norwood's bill, but Republican leaders like Representative Dick Armey of Texas and Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi oppose it.
In the last four years, the Congressional Budget Office said, "health spending has stabilized at about 13.5 percent of gross domestic product," or economic output. But it predicted that "the growth in health spending will soon accelerate," so that "national health expenditures will reach 15.5 percent of G.D.P. by 2008."
Health insurance premiums rose an average of 3.8 percent last year, the budget office said. It predicted that premiums would rise 5.5 percent this year, with similar annual increases in the coming decade.
The Federal Government spends more than $300 billion a year on Medicare and Medicaid, which together finance health care for more than 70 million people.

HEADLINE: Our Towns;
A Neighbor Just Says No To Casinos

BYLINE: By EVELYN NIEVES 

DATELINE: ATLANTIC CITY

 BODY:
THE beginning of the very long day she had been waiting for started out quite productively for Lillian Bryant.
First thing in the morning, she gave a tour of her neighborhood to one very interested guest, an assistant to the National Gambling Impact Study Commission. Then, while the state and local politicians were in Room 302 of the new convention center, telling the panel all the great things gambling had done for Atlantic City, Ms. Bryant was outside with 300 kindred spirits, marching and picketing and being interviewed as to why she thinks the casino situation has gone completely wrong. 
 By midmorning, Ms. Bryant had gone back to her tidy split-level house on Horace J. Bryant Jr. Drive to sit tight. There was nothing to do now until 7 P.M., when she would get to line up to make her plea for her neighborhood during the commission's long-awaited public session. She had reams of documents in imposing stacks that she could study. But she has spent more than two years, after all, making a case against the leveling of her house for a tunnel project. She could recite her arguments by heart. "I know what I'm going to say," she said, giggly with anticipation.
She is one of hundreds of people with agendas who signed up to speak to the commission, which is in town for two days on its first field trip to examine the social and economic impact of gambling on society. The anti-gambling and pro-gambling forces have been jockeying for position for weeks: compulsive gamblers and clergy and advocates for the homeless lining up to say that casinos are wrecking lives, and casino workers and elected officials and some business owners ready to call gambling Atlantic City's salvation.
BUT Ms. Bryant, a former Atlantic County Freeholder whose street is named after her father, the state's first black cabinet member as Banking and Insurance Commissioner, knows her case is special. She and two neighbors are fighting to keep their houses from being razed for a $330 million tunnel and road that Steve Wynn insisted the state build before he agreed to develop a casino in the city's Marina district. The city uses eminent domain to condemn other private properties for casino expansions, but none would demolish an intact, thriving neighborhood like Ms. Bryant's.
While owners of six of the nine houses that must be torn down for the tunnel have agreed to move, several have said they did so reluctantly. And whether the owners are willing or not, the tunnel project cuts to the heart of the debate over whether Atlantic City's casinos prosper at the expense of city neighborhoods.
Foes of the tunnel project call it a present to Mr. Wynn, since the state, which gave him the land to build his mega-casino, is assuming at least $220 million of the cost of the roadway to the new casino. On Tuesday, to Ms. Bryant's delight, Mr. Wynn gave foes some ammunition whenMirage Resorts Inc., his company, announced it was canceling a deal with two partners so that it could expand its own project. "The announcement doesn't surprise me," Ms. Bryant said. "But the timing of the announcement while the commission is here is the surprising part."
SHE was sure the move would help a Federal civil rights case she and two other homeowners have filed to stop the tunnel project. "At least I hope we get to trial," she said.
Members of the Impact Study Commission were already aware of Ms. Bryant's situation before they arrived here. In August, she and her neighbors went to Washington to testify at the commission's first public hearing. "We invited them to come to Atlantic City and see things for themselves," she said. "Now, they're here and they're supposed to be getting a tour of the city. Well, I called them up and offered them a tour of my neighborhood."
"I've had so many newspeople come here, and they all react the same way," Ms. Bryant said. "They can't believe the city and state would destroy this neighborhood." She was feeling chipper since Tim Bidwell, the assistant to the commission, had visited. "He told me that our neighborhood was better than the one he lives in in Washington," she said.
Last night, Ms. Bryant was No. 50 of 102 people scheduled to speak in front of the nine-member commission. In two hours, the commission heard from casino employees, compulsive gamblers and most vocally, trade union members with jobs to protect who brpought a cheering section of more than 50 supporters in orange T-shirts. People droned on and on, so the session was over after speaker No. 40. Ms. Bryant was forced to wait until another night to tell her story.

Rubin Defends Asian Bailout and Asks Funds for I.M.F.

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 21

 BODY:
Saying that the United States "cannot afford to stand back and gamble that the crisis will resolve itself," Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin defended the Clinton Administration's efforts today to calm Asia's financial turmoil and called on Congress to help by providing more money to the International Monetary Fund.
Faced with mounting criticism from both parties on Capitol Hill that the bailouts of Thailand, South Korea and Indonesia cost too much and yielded too little, Mr. Rubin said that restoring stability to Asia was a matter critical to the economic and national security of the United States. 
 Mr. Rubin sought to counter complaints from both Republicans and Democrats about the American role in the international rescue plans, including the criticism that the bailouts are insulating investors and international banks from the losses they suffer from misjudging the financial risks in the region.
"I would not give one nickel to help any creditor or investor, and in fact vast numbers of investors and creditors have taken large losses in Asia," Mr. Rubin said. He noted the huge declines in stock and currency markets there and the earnings problems that have already hit banking companies like J. P. Morgan, Chase Manhattan and Citicorp.
Those banks said this week that their profits in the fourth quarter had been reduced by the problems in Asia, though at Chase and Citicorp, at least, the problems were not severe enough to prevent earnings from increasing over all. Other banks, too, have sought to play down the effects of the crisis.
Mr. Rubin, in a speech at Georgetown University, said there was no practical way to insure that all investors and banks pay for their investment mistakes.
"A byproduct of programs designed to restore stability and growth may be that some creditors will be protected from the full consequences of their actions," Mr. Rubin said.
Mr. Rubin's speech was an effort by the Administration to explain its role in assembling promises of more than $100 billion in international financial assistance for Asian nations and to shore up political support in Congress. And it suggested the Administration's difficulties in assembling a bipartisan coalition on Capitol Hill that is supportive of maintaining support for an activist American role in managing the global economy, a problem shown most clearly late last year when Congress blocked President Clinton's request for a renewal of broad "fast track" trade negotiating authority.
The Administration has already asked Congress for $3.5 billion to bolster the I.M.F., and it will seek $14 billion this year as part of a broader plan to strengthen the I.M.F.
Some members of Congress have attacked Mr. Rubin for promising $1.7 billion to South Korea from a separate $40 billion pool of money known as the Exchange Stabilization Fund that can be used at the Administration's discretion. Republicans are considering legislation to limit the President's use of the fund.
Some conservative Republicans have been arguing against further funds for the I.M.F., saying the bailouts of South Korea, Thailand and Indonesia have done little to restore the region's economic health. They say that the best strategy is to let the financial markets sort out the winners and losers in the global economy.
For their part, liberal Democrats have criticized the Administration for not linking financial assistance to improving human rights and working conditions and to protecting the environment. They say that the rescue plans developed by the Administration and the I.M.F. either prop up repressive governments, as in Indonesia, or unfairly inflict economic pain on the ordinary citizens of nations like South Korea who bear no responsibility for the crisis.
To the conservative argument Mr. Rubin replied, "There is simply too much risk that markets alone will not resolve these problems of financial instability, and therefore given our stakes in Asia we must try to help get these countries back on track."
To the liberal critique Mr. Rubin responded that human rights, workplace issues and the environment, while important, should be not be thrown into the maelstrom of bringing an international financial crisis under control. "To add these three objectives, however important, would vastly complicate this effort and greatly reduce its chances of success," Mr. Rubin said.
If Congress were to deny the additional funding to the I.M.F., it could "reduce our leverage in the I.M.F., and could shake confidence in American leadership in the global economy at a time when confidence is so important in re-establishing stability in Asia," Mr. Rubin said.
Mr. Rubin also offered a defense of the I.M.F. itself, saying it is "the right institution to be at the center of these support programs."
Mr. Rubin said the Asian crisis had its roots in "close links between governments, banks and corporations" in the region that led to "fundamentally unsound investments by corporations funded by unsound lending from banks." Further fueling the problem, he said, were foreign investors, who "injected an extraordinary amount of capital into these flawed systems without due weighting to the risks involved."
But the heart of his argument was that while the effects of the crisis on the United States have been relatively limited so far, the financial instability could spread to other nations and eventually derail the long economic expansion and stock market boom enjoyed by Americans.
"When we act to resolve the Asian crisis, we act to protect and benefit the American people," he said.
Mr. Rubin said the world's other big economic powers also have a responsibility to help avert a global downturn. Europe, he said, could do more to strengthen its tentative economic recovery. And he said it was "absolutely critical" that Japan strengthen its banking system, spur domestic demand and further open its market to foreign goods.
"A weak Japan is a source of weakness for the region," he said. "A strong Japan would be a source of strength for the region."

U.S. Trade Deficit Narrowed In November in Surprise Drop

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The United States trade deficit unexpectedly narrowed in November, though analysts said it was likely to be only a brief respite before the Asian economic crisis leads to larger deficits this year.
The trade deficit shrank to $8.037 billion in November from a revised $9.091 billion in October, as both exports and imports declined, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. Many economists had expected the deficit to rise. 
 The deficits with China, Japan and most Pacific Rim countries also narrowed in November, countering expectations that currency devaluations in Asia would increase United States imports by reducing the cost of foreign-made goods.
Still, despite the declines in the deficits with Japan and China in November, the gaps with those countries over the first 11 months of last year were up 16.7 percent and 24 percent, respectively.
And today, the Japanese Government reported further indications of the trend toward a rising imbalance in trade between the United States and that country. Japan's merchandise trade surplus rose in December by 40.9 percent from a year earlier, and the surplus with the United States rose by 25.4 percent.
For all of 1997, Japan's overall trade surplus expanded by 48.5 percent, the first annual rise in five years, the Ministry of Finance reported.
In a separate report yesterday, the Federal Reserve said that economic ripples from the Asian turmoil were felt in most regions of the United States in recent weeks. "Manufacturers and agricultural firms report weaker exports to Asia, and there was some evidence of increased competition from Asian products in U.S. markets," the Fed said in its regional survey, known as the beige book.
That has helped keep inflation absent from the American economy, the Fed said, noting that "prices were generally flat" in the period covered by the survey.
Analysts said the narrowing of the United States trade gap could be accounted for in part by problems with the way the Commerce Department computes the figures.
"We have been arguing for some time that the Government's seasonal adjustment procedure for the fourth quarter produces a narrowing of the deficit," said Anne Mills, an economist at Lehman Brothers in New York. "Today's numbers are a reflection of the seasonal adjustment, not the underlying data."
Lee Price, Acting Under Secretary for Economic Affairs, acknowledged that there were problems with the adjustment process, but added that the pattern did not show up consistently in every trade category and that Government economists were reluctant to force a general adjustment on the numbers only to try to correct the trend.
The trade figures could give a lift to the fourth quarter's gross domestic product, which economists had been forecasting to grow at about a 3.5 percent annual rate.
Economists said that the trade numbers for January or February should better reflect the actual trade situation and begin to show the effects of the Asian crisis. "It's the calm before the storm," Ms. Mills said.
The trade deficit for all of 1997 is on target to total $111 billion, matching last year's total, which was the largest since a $115 billion deficit in 1988.
"There isn't any doubt in anyone's mind where the trend is going on trade," said James Glassman, chief domestic economist at Chase Securities in New York. "It would defy logic for it to go the other way."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Samsung Will Sell Property And End a Skyscraper Plan

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Thursday, Jan. 22

 BODY:
The Samsung Group will sell a $300 million portfolio of global properties, get an $80 million cash infusion from its chairman and scrap plans for a Seoul skyscraper under a restructuring that the Korean conglomerate said was aimed at improving competitiveness.
The restructuring disclosed on Wednesday makes Samsung, one of South Korea's largest employers and the world's leading maker of computer memory chips, the third big corporation here to announce an overhaul this week, in response to President-elect Kim Dae Jung's plea for meaningful changes in business practices that are widely blamed for the country's economic crisis. 
 Samsung's plan would refocus the company on three or four businesses including the Samsung Electronics Company, the semiconductor maker that is its most valuable asset. The plan also appeared to go further than others by including a contribution of personal wealth from Lee Kun Hee, the conglomerate's chairman.
But the plan failed to answer a basic question: Will Mr. Lee abandon his pet project, a $2.5 billion automobile factory that would add another competitor to the overcrowded global car market? Instead, Samsung said it had canceled a 102-story office project in Seoul and would sell branch-office buildings in New York, London and Singapore, which it valued in all around $300 million.
Samsung's silence on cars coincided with a second appeal from President-elect Kim to the conglomerates to make sacrifices. "Large conglomerates, for both themselves and the country, must launch speedy and strong reforms," he said through a spokesman, adding that such changes "shouldn't be superficial."
Samsung said Mr. Lee would sell personal property valued at 128 billion won, now nearly $75 million, to help strengthen the finances of some affiliates. He also plans to donate 90 percent of the roughly $6 million he makes annually for the four or five years the company estimates it will take for the economy to recover. And he will withdraw bank deposits and sell part of his stock portfolio to raise about $6 million for a fund to help Samsung workers dismissed in the corporate revamping.
The President-elect was said to be dismayed that the chairmen of Hyundai and LG, the two other conglomerates that announced restructuring proposals, had not committed some of their own money.
Mr. Kim has emphasized a need for business and the Government to share the burden of extricating South Korea from its financial mess. Ordinary workers, who had little to do with the profligate corporate borrowing that helped cause the economic turmoil, are most likely to suffer unemployment.
In an interview on Wednesday, Kim Won Gil, chief policy maker for Mr. Kim's National Congress for New Politics, said many of the conglomerates, known as chaebol, were trying to pass off as reforms policies they will be forced to adopt by law -- such as consolidating financial statements and eliminating the practice of group affiliates guaranteeing each other's debts.
"The owner of a business group putting his own money in to contribute is a sort of gesture that he cares, and that's fine," he said. "But most importantly, the owners of the chaebols must seriously adjust their businesses to make them globally competitive."

Trade Deficit Drops, But Asia Impact Widens
The Commerce Department said the trade deficit declined in November, defying expectations of an increase tied to Asian currency devaluations that have made Asian exports cheaper in the United States. But economists called the drop a brief respite and repeated predictions that the deficit will surge in coming months.
Other economic data showed the impact of Asia's economic crisis is spreading throughout this country. A Federal Reserve report on regional economic activity said Asia-bound exports of American manufacturers and agricultural concerns had fallen, and there is evidence of increased competition with Asian products in domestic markets. Page D8. 

Indonesia Currency Plunges 23%
The Indonesian rupiah plunged 23 percent against the dollar early today, showing a growing lack of faith in the country by investors and suggesting that a recovery will be more difficult than previously seen. D8.
 
Fidelity Insurance Plan Advances
The S.E.C. has given preliminary approval to a plan that would allow Fidelity Investments to establish a mutual insurance company to guarantee its money market funds against some losses. Such a plan could give the leading mutual fund company an advantage in selling such funds. But the S.E.C.'s decision limits how a fund's insured status can be publicized. D4.
 
Hurdles to Giant Drug Deal
One of the chief obstacles to a possible deal between American Home Products and SmithKline Beecham appears to be American Home's legal liabilities from its two diet drugs, Redux and Pondimin, analysts say. The shares of both companies retreated yesterday, a day after the two confirmed that they were considering a merger. D5.
 
First Boeing Loss in 50 Years
Boeing said the cost of absorbing McDonnell Douglas would result in a $1.4 billion pretax charge against fourth-quarter earnings, more than expected. Coupled with $2.6 billion in previously announced charges for production problems, the charges mean Boeing will report its first annual loss since 1947 when results are announced next week. D5.
 
Accounting Trouble at Sybase
Sybase, a provider of data base software, discovered accounting irregularities at its Japanese subsidiary, forcing the company to postpone release of its financial results and to revise earlier reports. D7.
 
Texas Instruments Sees Gains
Texas Instruments showed a big rise in quarterly operating earnings and forecast a bright outlook for the year. After a number of one-time charges, however, the company had a loss of $285 million for the quarter. D4.

Iraq Freezes Inspections
In Baghdad, President Saddam Hussein called for a freeze on weapons inspections and even the discussion of sites considered sensitive, Iraqi and United Nations officials said. Iraq told the chief U.N. arms inspector that there should be no more talks until April about sites that Iraq has put off-limits. A6
 
U.S. Hints at Iraq Action
President Clinton said that the time for diplomacy might be dwindling in the confrontation with President Hussein over Iraq's refusal to open its suspected biological and chemical weapons sites to U.N. inspectors.

Iran President Cools to U.S.
The initiative by President Mohammad Khatami of Iran to break down what he called the "wall of mistrust" between his country and the United States seems to be dead. Some said that Mr. Khatami's harshly worded sermon on Monday branding the United States an enslaver of Iran illustrated that for the sake of unity he had retreated from his previous warm words. A7
 
Crisis in Northern Ireland Talks

Clinton Denies Affair With White House Worker
President Clinton denied that he had had a sexual affair with a White House intern, and he promised cooperation with prosecutors investigating whether he had obstructed justice by seeking to cover up the reported liaison. The Whitewater independent counsel, who issued more White House subpoenas, opened his inquiry after obtaining tape recordings of the former intern discussing her relationship with the President and an assertion that she had been advised to lie under oath to protect him. A1
 
New Findings on Cause of PMS
A study called into question the view that premenstrual syndrome is an emotional disorder, suggesting instead that its cause is biological. The study suggested that the symptoms of PMS stemmed from an aberrant effect on the brain of changes in blood levels of the hormones estrogen and progesterone. The findings may change how PMS is regarded by the medical profession and the public, and how it is treated. A1
 
Consensus in Unabom Case

HEADLINE: AT THE MOVIES;
Looking Back At 2 Classics

BYLINE: By Bernard Weinraub 

DATELINE: PARK CITY, Utah, Jan. 22

 BODY:
By the time he was 30, Paul Schrader (left) had written the screenplay for "Taxi Driver," which was directed by Martin Scorsese and starred Robert De Niro. Four years later, the three men teamed up again for "Raging Bull," the 1979 classic that, like "Taxi Driver," was arguably one of the most significant films made since World War II.
Was it, perhaps, a burden to write two great screenplays at such an early age and have everything that follows compared with them? 
 "Actually, a huge burden fell off my shoulders," said the bespectacled, ebullient 51-year-old writer and director, whose newest film, "Affliction," opened the other night here at the Sundance Film Festival, the nation's premier showcase for independent films.
"Having done fairly early on work that I thought was valuable and I thought would endure was an enormous relief," he said. "I knew that I had done something in life. I know people my age who still have not had that sense of personal artistic reward. And it gets to be a hard and bitter thing in your 50's and 60's, never to have had this sense of 'I did something.' And I got that in my 20's. And I was free. And it was a kind of liberation."
It has not been a particularly easy festival for Mr. Schrader because his film -- despite the presence of actors like Nick Nolte, Sissy Spacek, James Coburn and Willem Dafoe -- has not found a distributor to release it. Based on a Russell Banks novel, the movie is a harsh and intense drama about the lone police officer in an economically depressed town in New Hampshire who is struggling with personal demons. "The material is strong." Mr. Schrader said. "It's a marketing challenge."
He shrugged. "It's not that I've changed; in some ways, I've basically made the same film," he said. "I've always been drawn to men adrift, people with souls but without lives, guys who say, 'I'll find a life,' 'I'll find a wife,' 'Something will come together for me.' In many ways I'm the defender of a dying breed, the existential hero."
What's changed, Mr. Schrader said, is the Hollywood system: "The studios don't make these films anymore. They're not in that business." And the fact that he doesn't live in Los Angeles but on Riverside Drive in Manhattan doesn't help.
"It's a problem," he said. "If you live in New York long enough -- and I've lived there 14 years -- an entire new generation of executives and hustlers have come upon the scene in L.A. whom you've never met. I don't know those people."
Mr. Schrader left Los Angeles because, he said, his life was out of control. "It was '81, '82," he said. "The drug scene was wide open. Everyone was convinced it wasn't going to hurt you. And with drugs, and cocaine in particular, you can go on for a number of years and be in control of the drugs. And anybody who tells you those first couple of years of cocaine aren't fun is lying. But then all of a sudden you wake up and you are no longer doing the drug. The drug is doing you. And you're not in control."
At the time, he said, his relationship with a woman had collapsed. "I was agonizing day and night," Mr. Schrader said. "And when these women problems hit me, the drugs stepped in and said, 'I'll take care of that.' I got frightened. I left L.A. to get straight and change my life."
Mr. Schrader is married to the actress Mary Beth Hurt, who is also in "Affliction." They have two children. His professional life, he said, is divided. On one hand, he has focused his energies on directing films, including "The Comfort of Strangers," "Light Sleeper' and "Patty Hearst." He made his directorial debut in 1978 with "Blue Collar," starring Richard Pryor and Harvey Keitel.
On the other hand, he is also a screenwriter for hire, a job that pays the bills.
"I don't make a living directing films like 'Affliction,' " he said. "I don't send my kids to private school in New York on those salaries. Fortunately, I'm still able to turn a dollar as a writer, I still come up with one big writing gig a year to cover my expenses." He has films in development for Barry Levinson, Mr. Scorsese, Penny Marshall and Sharon Stone, among others.
Mr. Schrader, whose deeply religious Dutch Calvinist background informs a great deal of his work, admits that, like most writers, he gets anxious every now and then about his creativity. "You get flat for a day or a week and suddenly you start thinking it's for the rest of your life," he said. "It does get anxious. And there's the fact that artists tend to have short creative lives."
"Most artists have seven hot years," he said. "And then there are seven shadow years of the hot years. And the rest of their lives are living off of that. Except for some. Some rare artists are able to reinvent themselves with second lives."
 
A Career Picks Up
The queen of last year's Sundance festival was the New York-based actress Parker Posey, who was in at least three films at the time. This year, Ms. Posey is in one, a poorly received comedy, "The Misadventures of Margaret."
To his amazement, the New York-based actor Sam Rockwell (below) has been called this year's Parker Posey. The cheerful and friendly 29-year-old actor, who is also based in New York, is in three films here -- "Jerry and Tom," a Quentin Tarantino-like violent comedy about some hit men, directed by the actor Saul Rubinek; a screwball comedy, "Safe Men," directed by John Hamburg, and a drama, "Lawn Dogs," directed by John Duigan.
Mr. Rockwell said that he had been startled by the comparison to Ms. Posey -- "Well, oh yeah, I guess that's flattering" -- but that it was purely accidental that he had three films at Sundance. "A fluke," he said, eating breakfast at a hotel here hours after his arrival. "I lucked out. Actually, I made 'Lawn Dogs' about three years ago."
He's hardly complaining. Having struggled in New York for several years -- for a while he was a bus boy -- Mr. Rockwell is now in a position to pick and choose his roles in independent films.
Hollywood studios have expressed interest in Mr. Rockwell, but he has not been selected for any choice roles.
He flew to the festival during a brief break in the Off Broadway play "Goose-Pimples," a dark comedy in which he is appearing. He said his career breakthrough took place last year at Sundance when he co-starred with John Turturro in the comedy "Box of Moonlight," directed by Tom DeCillo.
The film was not a box-office success, but Mr. Rockwell's portrait of a whimsical Peter Pan figure led to many offers from directors. "That film was definitely a turning point, and I was sort of put on some independent film map after 10 years in New York," he said.
Of his roles, Mr. Rockwell said, "I'm getting kind of the goofball misfit right now."
Mr. Rockwell's parents, now divorced, were aspiring actors. He spent most of his childhood with his father, a printer and union organizer, in the San Francisco area. While a senior in high school, Mr. Rockwell appeared in an independent film and shortly after that moved to New York to act.
Mr. Rockwell said that for a while, like many actors in New York, he tried to be ethnic. "I was obsessed with De Niro," he said. "I tried to emulate him. I thought I was Italian at one point. Yeah, I know, it's a stretch. Actually, I have a pretty muddish look. I can go Polish, I can go half-Jewish and half-Irish." His television roles have included a policeman as well as a killer on "Law and Order" and a crack addict on "N.Y.P.D. Blue."
A few years ago, he tried living in Los Angeles but returned to New York.
"Being single there and not working every day is hard in L.A., much harder than New York, where you can walk the streets and get on a subway and do something," he said. "Being an unemployed actor in L.A. is very strange. It can mess your mind."
Being unemployed is not in the cards now. He's no longer interested in the low-low-budget independent films -- "You know, bring your own coffee" -- and now looks for good scripts and even an amenity or two.
"When I did 'Lawn Dogs' and 'Jerry and Tom,' I had a trailer and a refrigerator and a stereo and I got a decent paycheck, and I thought, 'I'm happy, what more do I want?' " he said. "I can make a living now, which is great."
Mr. Rockwell said that at Sundance he hoped to go to a party or two. "I'm hoping to meet girls when I'm here," he said.
That shouldn't be a problem.

HEADLINE: ARCHITECTURE REVIEW;
Greening a South Bronx Brownfield

BYLINE: By HERBERT MUSCHAMP 

 BODY:
The Getty Center is finished, the Guggenheim Bilbao branch is done, the competition to design the Museum of Modern Art's expansion has ended with the choice of a graceful plan. After this cluster of high-profile projects, architecture deserves a breather. Here's a breath of fresh air: Maya Lin's design for the Bronx Community Paper Company. A scale model and drawing for this thoughtful, idealistic design are now on view at the Urban Center in a crisply installed show presented by the Municipal Art Society.
Low-rise, low-down, planned for a gritty, out-of-the-way location, this project may never earn a stellar place on the international circuit of must-see contemporary architectural attractions. That's fine. Ms. Lin probably got stardom out her system by the time she was 21, when she designed the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, still one of the most visited places of our time. And her new project grapples with a more substantial set of issues than landmarks usually address: urban infrastructure, community rebuilding, the survival of the planet -- that sort of thing. 
 This project is a model exercise in cleaning up the rust belt. It is designed for a 26-acre tract of the Harlem River Rail Yards, a triangular plot of land at the southern tip of the Bronx. The Triborough Bridge slices through the site, which was abandoned in 1971. Planners use the dismal term brownfield to describe this type of site: a former industrial area, often with polluted ground.
Two agencies have collaborated to create the paper mill: the Natural Resources Defense Council, a nationwide environmental advocacy organization, and the Banana Kelly Community Improvement Association, a group that promotes economic development in the South Bronx. Trees and money. Green and green. Often, the two forces are depicted as adversaries. This project seeks to ally them.
The plant would recycle almost 300,000 tons of wastepaper annually, roughly a quarter of that generated by New York City, producing more than 200,000 tons of newsprint for the city's publishers. It would create at least 400 permanent jobs and yield about $30 million in annual tax revenue. Trees, featured prominently in the landscaping around the plant, are intended to symbolize the 3.4 million trees spared by the recycling. Plainly visible from cars passing over the bridge, the trees would also signal the sprouting of economic growth in a notoriously depressed part of town.
Sponsors of the $370 million project are negotiating with potential investors. They hope to break ground this fall and complete construction in 2000.
Ms. Lin's design is visually spare, conceptually rich. Housed in a complex of four aluminum-clad sheds, two or three stories high, the plant is split in two at the point where the bridge crosses overhead. One section contains equipment for de-inking and pulping waste paper. The other, connected by a metal bridge, houses the paper mill, along with storage for finished rolls of newsprint.
The fanciest bit of design work occurs at the plant entrance, where Ms. Lin creates a de Stijl-like composition from roof planes of different dimensions and heights. This contains the plant's offices. An outdoor stair of concrete, unsupported from beneath, leads to the entrance and, up another flight, to offices on the second floor. Facing the stair is a wall of cascading water, similar to the waterfall at the rear of Paley Park on East 53d Street in Manhattan but enclosed behind glass. A tall exhaust stack, rising beyond, is also encased by glass.
These elements are at once formal, functional and symbolic. Air heated in the glass stack powers the building's cooling system. Cool air drawn from the water wall circulates in the offices. The water itself, treated gray water from the Wards Island sewage plant, is used in the recycling. Energy is also saved by the use of skylights and louvered clerestories, which admit natural light and ventilation throughout.
Ms. Lin, who studied architecture at Yale, has worked here with a firm of project architects, HLW International. She describes herself as a designer or an artist rather than an architect. Many of her works fall into the category of public art. Her design projects, for example her interior of the Museum for African Art in SoHo, tend to fall outside stylistic genres. Deliberately or not, however, her Bronx design recalls the work of Charles and Ray Eames, designers whose work also straddled disciplines.
Asked to define the boundaries of design, Charles Eames replied, "What are the boundaries of problems?" In the famous Case Study House they designed for themselves in Pacific Palisades, Calif., in 1949, the Eameses faced the problem of building low-cost housing for the postwar suburb. Their solution was a classic modern machine in the garden, a steel frame, inserted with panels of glass and wood, set in towering eucalyptus. To the eye, the house offered a happy reconciliation of nature and technology, achieved at one-fifteenth the cost of a traditional masonry house.
Nearly 50 years later, Ms. Lin's clients face a different set of problems. Suburbanization has drained parts of the city of people, jobs and stability. The Machine -- industrial production -- has been exported overseas. Landfills are full. Clean water and air turn out not to be limitless. Nature can no longer be treated simply as scenery.
Solutions to these problems do not reside within the realm of visual imagination. Without her clients' experience in economic and environmentally sustainable growth, Ms. Lin would be hard put to solve them. She operates, rather, at the place where visual metaphor and material reality intersect.
Ms. Lin wants the building to send the message that the forest is now urban. It's the newspaper you are reading, and millions like it, there for the harvesting each day. The trees planted outside the mill would be reflected in its aluminum walls, and echoed by the rhythm of the steel columns inside. Naturally, a forest should have a waterfall. And if that lovely cloud happened to come from a smokestack, at least this green machine would make it easier to breathe.
Maya Lin's design for the Bronx Community Paper Company will remain on view at the Urban Center, 457 Madison Avenue, near 50th Street, through Feb. 6.

HEADLINE: Housing Tax Credits

 BODY:

To the Editor:
A Jan. 18 editorial in support of tax credits to build low-income housing perpetuates a myth. The original Section 8 effort never achieved its goal of adding thousands of affordable housing units and instead became a costly program. Considering today's construction costs, the Clinton Administration's belief that tax credits will add 36,000 rental units extends this economic myth.
What we really need is a comprehensive program for affordable housing, making units available for low-, moderate- and middle-income people. We must also ask how we can help the millions of Americans who are already poorly housed or homeless.

HEADLINE: Singapore's Softer Model

 BODY:

To the Editor:
William Safire (column, Jan. 19) blames the East Asian financial crisis on the "Singapore model, taken up throughout Asia," of social order taking precedence over individual freedom.
Singapore's authoritarianism has always been far softer than, say, the Korea of the 1980 Kwangju massacre, or the Taiwan that slaughtered 10,000 dissidents in 1948. The (nuanced) difference is Singapore's failure to evolve toward the lively political competition we see today in the other two countries. 
 Similarly, Mr. Safire implies that Singapore chauvinists ascribe the country's spectacular economic success to "state-controlled commerce" and covert dealings among "power elites." Hardly! Singapore has a high degree of financial transparency and relatively little "crony capitalism."
As a result, Singapore's case of financial Asian flu is relatively mild, due mostly to the troubles of its trading partners.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Fiat Chief Wants G.E. Officer as Successor

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: ROME, Jan. 22

 BODY:
The chairman of Fiat S.p.A., Italy's largest corporation, said today that he would step down in June and would recommend that Paolo Fresco, a vice chairman of the General Electric Company, take his place.
The chairman, Cesare Romiti, who took over in 1996 from Giovanni Agnelli, the grandson of the founder of the giant auto group, said on Italian television that he would propose Mr. Fresco as his successor when the Fiat board meets on Jan. 30. 
 A spokesman for the GE International unit of General Electric in Fairfield, Conn., said that Mr. Fresco, who turns 65 in July, had made it clear in the past that he intended to stay on at the company until late 1998. "If they can live with that, then he is available and would be flattered to accept," the spokesman, Jay Pomeroy, said.
The announcement from Fiat, which is based in Turin, was cheered by investors. Shares of Fiat rose 370 lire, or 6.5 percent, to 6,050 lire. In New York, American depository receipts of Fiat rose $1.125, to $17. Each A.D.R. represents five shares of the Italian auto maker.
Speculation as to who would succeed Mr. Romiti, who reaches the company's mandatory retirement age of 75 in June, quickened in December after the death from cancer of Mr. Agnelli's nephew, Giovanni Alberto Agnelli. But the younger Mr. Agnelli, who was 33, held no senior management jobs at Fiat. And friends of Mr. Fresco said today that the Agnellis, Fiat's largest shareholders, had offered Mr. Fresco the job at least six months ago.
A major task of Mr. Fresco would be to "make the transition from a family-run company to one run by someone from outside," said Daniel T. Jones, professor of auto industry management at the University of Cardiff in Wales. He described Mr. Romiti as a "loyal internal servant."
Mr. Fresco, a native of the north of Italy and a lawyer by training, joined General Electric in 1962. In his most recent job at General Electric, Mr. Fresco has been the righthand man of the chairman and chief executive, John F. Welch Jr., in casting the company's strategy for global expansion. Overseas revenue now accounts for about 40 percent of G.E.'s total, the company spokesman said.
As chairman of Fiat, Mr. Fresco would be responsible for plotting long-term strategy and appointing management. Daily operations are the job of the group's chief executive, Paolo Cantarella, 53, the former head of the automobile division who engineered Fiat's remarkable comeback from the recession of 1993, when an aging model line and weak markets in its major businesses pushed the group deeply into the red.
As Fiat chairman, Mr. Romiti has been one of the most prominent executives tarred by Italy's campaign against corruption. In 1997, he was convicted on charges of illegal payments to political parties for favors to Fiat and he was barred from holding corporate office in Italy. The sentence is not applicable pending an appeal. Earlier this month, he was ordered to stand trial again on similar charges. Fiat acknowledges that its officials paid bribes in the past, but it has always denied that Mr. Romiti was informed.
Though Fiat's core business is automobiles and commercial vehicles, the group's activities range from insurance and rail car manufacturing to publishing newspapers. Revenue in 1997 amounted to almost 90 trillion lire ($52 billion), and global auto sales totaled 2.7 million cars, making Fiat Europe's second-largest auto maker after Volkswagen.
The Agnelli family, which owns 33 percent of Fiat, effectively controls the group through a so-called syndicate pact with three other large shareholders -- Deutsche Bank of Germany, the Italian investment bank Mediobanca and Assicurazioni Generali, the insurance group. But the loose arrangement, common in Italian business, expires in 1999.
Mr. Jones of the University of Cardiff said Fiat's strategy of producing a world car, the Palio, was bearing rich fruit. In 1997, sales in Brazil, the launching pad for the Palio, totaled 508,000 cars, making Fiat the No. 1 manufacturer there, ahead of General Motors. Other world car plants are planned or under construction in places like India, Russia, South Africa and Turkey.
Fiat's main challenge in the medium term, Mr. Jones said, would be to "keep being nimble in its global strategy," notably in large but threatened Asian markets like China and India.

HEADLINE: Jack Lord, 77, Helped Direct And Starred In 'Hawaii Five-O'

BYLINE: By LAWRIE MIFFLIN 

 BODY:
Jack Lord, the deadpan star of "Hawaii Five-O" who made "Book him, Danno" a fixture of American slang, died Wednesday at his home in Honolulu.
He was 77 and died of congestive heart failure, said Carolyn Tanaka, a spokeswoman for Marie Lord, the actor's wife and only survivor. 
Playing the strait-laced, tight-lipped Detective Steve McGarrett, head of an elite state police investigative unit, Mr. Lord helped make "Hawaii Five-O" the longest running police drama in television history. It lasted 12 seasons on CBS, from 1968 to 1980, and was also seen in more than 80 other countries.
The phrase "Book him, Danno," used when the bad guy was captured, came from the name of Detective McGarrett's assistant, Detective Danny Williams, who was played until the show's penultimate season by James MacArthur.
Mr. Lord was not only the star; his contract gave him control over dramatic decisions on every episode, and it was he who insisted, against the network's wishes, that the show be shot entirely on location in Hawaii.
That decision enhanced not only the show's appeal, as viewers seemed as entranced by the idyllic island scenery as by the crime stories, but also the Hawaiian economy. The network's spending on the production and on staff members' living expenses was estimated at more than $100 million a year, and the show fostered what Hawaiian Government officials called significant increases in tourism.
"It was considered the ultimate travelogue for Hawaii," David F. Poltrack, executive vice president of research at CBS, said yesterday. "The ascent of Hawaii as a major tourist location coincided with the strong years of that program. It really hit a chord."
Mr. Lord helped shape the show with its creator and executive producer, the late Leonard Freeman. After Freeman's death in 1973, a succession of producers followed, but it was widely known that Mr. Lord controlled the show. He also directed several episodes.
"He was always a strict taskmaster, a perfectionist," said Kam Fong, an original cast member, who played Detective Chin Ho Kelly for 10 years. "When we were on the set, it was strictly business; he wouldn't stand for any horseplay. And he was not the sociable type. After work, he had nothing to do with us socially.
"But I learned quite a lot from him, and so did others," said Mr. Fong, who had acted on stage but never in films or television until "Hawaii Five-O." "We always had a lot of local actors on the show who were inexperienced, and he helped them a lot. He would yell at them, but always to help them learn."
Different biographies give varying birth dates for Mr. Lord, but Ms. Tanaka said the correct date was Dec. 30, 1920. He was born John Joseph Patrick Ryan, in Brooklyn, the son of a steamship company executive. As a youth, he served as a merchant marine officer, and pursued his first love, painting, while working on freighters around the world.
Returning to New York, he won a football scholarship to New York University, where he majored in fine arts.
Selling Cadillacs from a showroom at 57th and Broadway by day, Mr. Lord began studying acting with Sanford Meisner at the Neighborhood Playhouse by night. His first break was a role in the Ralph Bellamy television series "Man Against Crime," and he went on to play in numerous live television dramas in the early 1950's. He also appeared in four Broadway plays, including Elia Kazan's production of "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof," in the role of Brick.
He later had roles in several movies, most notably "Dr. No," one of the early James Bond films.
Before "Hawaii Five-O," Mr. Lord won acclaim as the lead character, a rodeo rider, in "Stoney Burke," a 1962-63 series that lasted one season competing against "I Love Lucy" and "The Danny Thomas Show."
According to Mr. Fong and to other acquaintances quoted in Hawaiian newspaper accounts, Mr. Lord and his wife, a former fashion designer, were famously reclusive. In recent years, when Mr. Lord's health deteriorated, he was rarely seen.
The Lords, who moved to Hawaii from New York during the show's early seasons and never left, were married for more than 50 years, according to Ms. Tanaka, and had occupied themselves since 1980 with charitable work and relaxation.

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate;
Town House Project Is Rising on Hudson Shore

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
The first town house project to be built along the resurgent Hudson River in a decade is rising at the water's edge in West New York, N.J.
K. Hovnanian Enterprises of Red Bank, the largest home builder in New Jersey, has started construction on Jacob's Ferry, 258 two- and three-bedroom luxury town houses with garages, balconies and Manhattan views. It is the company's first development along the Hudson. 
 The town houses will rise on fallow industrial land at the water's edge in West New York, a Hudson County town of 39,000 atop the Palisade cliffs whose nearly one-mile-long waterfront, at the base of those cliffs, has sat idle since shipping and rail operations there ceased 25 years ago. Sale prices for the units are to start at $200,000 and go to $500,000 for homes directly on the water.
There will also be 33 more homes started later this year on land jutting out into the river. Those on the peninsula are expected to cost 30 to 70 percent more, said Robert D. Jackson, president of Hovnanian's metropolitan New York region.
Industry experts see the project as something of a barometer of demand for riverfront housing. In the two years since the real estate industry emerged from the recession, about 2,700 residences have been or are being built along the 18-mile shoreline once known as the Gold Coast, with most of them luxury rentals, according to RAD Consultants, a real estate services concern in Fairfield, N.J. Hundreds more are planned.
With Jacob's Ferry, which is across from midtown Manhattan at about 56th Street, the activity is slowly turning to condominiums, which dominated riverfront construction before the mid-1980's building boom deflated.
Other developers are expected to follow Hovnanian's lead. Among them is Applied Companies of Hoboken, N.J., which is reviving a 1,290-unit condo project in Jersey City and plans to start the initial phase this spring. Later this year, the company expects to add condominiums to a rental development under way in Hoboken. Together, they will produce about 298 condominiums.
Hovnanian also plans to start construction later this year on a second 154-unit town house project, to be called Bull's Ferry, on a site north of Jacob's Ferry, with 132 of the Bull's Ferry homes rising in neighboring Guttenberg in Hudson County.
James H. Robbins, managing director at RAD, said the rental vacancy rate was about 5 percent and rents have risen. His company put the average monthly rent for a two-bedroom apartment at $2,000, up from an average of $1,800 last year.
When the monthly cost of renting a unit is comparable to the cost of owning one, it starts to make sense for some people to buy, Mr. Robbins said. "The challenge has not been a lack of demand but a lack of financing" for the developers, he added.
With riverfront land a scarce commodity, the West New York site represents an opportunity, said Ara Hovnanian, president of K. Hovnanian Enterprises, which has been considering the waterfront market for 10 years. "There are not a lot of ownership opportunities now, the demand is huge and conditions that were great before are now superb."
The demand, Mr. Hovnanian said, is coming from professional couples working in northern New Jersey or Manhattan. He said he also expected to draw some people who are now living in Manhattan or elsewhere in New York City.
Hovnanian is tapping its own equity and bank credit to finance its riverfront projects, which are to rise on 20 acres. They will cost $100 million to build, including the price of the land, which has undergone an environmental cleanup.
Hovnanian bought the land from the Roseland Property Company of Roseland, N.J. It is part of a 98-acre tract, straddling West New York and Guttenberg, that Roseland purchased two years ago from Arthur E. Imperatore, who runs New York Waterway, the ferry service. The entire 98-acre tract, including land in both towns, is zoned to allow 4,360 housing units. Roseland has begun a 276-unit rental project on the part of the site that it has retained.
Mr. Imperatore, who still owns 150 adjacent acres in Weehawken, once envisioned building a Venetian-style city on the entire tract. While the Weehawken land became the base for his ferry service to Manhattan, which is being expanded, only a golf driving range took shape on the West New York portion.
For West New York, the projects "are not only the beginning of the renaissance of our waterfront but of the entire town," said Mayor Albio Sires. As one of the state's poorest and most densely populated municipalities, West New York needs the tax revenue, jobs and recreational space that waterfront development could bring. When completed, over the next decade, the waterfront developments are expected to generate $11 million to $12 million in taxes a year to the town, Mayor Sires said.
The brick and vinyl-sided town houses at Jacob's Ferry will have 1,200 to 2,333 square feet of living space. Those on the peninsula will be 3,800 to 4,200 square feet with lofts. All the units will be laid out over 10 acres interspersed with courtyards and open space, and nearly half will have clear river views, Mr. Hovnanian said.
Under a financial agreement with West New York, real estate taxes on the units will be kept lower than non-abated projects for the first six years, about $6,000 a year for the median-priced $300,000 home. Maintenance fees are expected to be no more than $200 a month.
Amenities will include two swimming pools, a clubhouse and a public riverfront walkway.
Mr. Hovnanian said sales were to start in the spring.

Oil Futures Plunge, Sending Stocks Lower

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Two of three big American oil companies reporting quarterly earnings yesterday said their results were above expectations. But oil company stocks fell sharply as investors expected future results to suffer because of falling oil prices.
Chevron said its earnings roughly doubled, while Texaco's profit rose 22 percent. Amoco posted a 10 percent decline. But sales were lower at all three companies, causing concern that continued price softness would affect first-quarter earnings. 
 Crude oil futures plunged to their lowest prices in more than three years yesterday amid concern about sharply increased output from OPEC member countries, coupled with lighter demand from Asian nations because of economic turmoil.
On Wall Street, Amoco shares fell $2.4375, to $80.125, on the New York Stock Exchange. Chevron shares fell $1.5625, to $75.4375, on the Big Board, while Texaco shares were down $1.125, to $52.875, also on the New York exchange.
Chevron, which is based in San Francisco, earned $929 million, or $1.41 a share on a diluted basis, in the fourth quarter, up from $464 million, or 71 cents a diluted share, a year earlier. Sales fell to $9.71 billion from $11.27 billion.
Texaco, which is based in White Plains, earned $623 million, or $1.12 a diluted share, in the fourth quarter, up from $509 million, or 93 cents a diluted share, a year earlier. Sales were $12.05 billion, a 6.4 percent decline from $12.87 billion a year earlier.
Amoco, which is based in Chicago, said net income fell to $789 million, or $1.62 a diluted share, in the fourth quarter, from $871 million, or $1.73 a diluted share, a year earlier.
Revenues fell 4 percent, to $9.69 billion from $10.12 billion.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Dow Continues Its Retreat as Profit Hopes Grow Dimmer

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
Another round of corporate earnings disappointments took its toll on stocks yesterday, dragging major indexes lower for a second consecutive day.
The latest quarterly earnings shortfalls -- from companies like Schlumberger, the oil driller; Sears, Roebuck, the retailer, and Altera and Sybase, both technology concerns -- heightened fears that the overriding trend for corporate profits in 1998 could be lower. 
 To be sure, a number of companies, including market bellwethers like Microsoft, have reported earnings that were higher than expected. But even the software giant warned that future results could be hurt by the economic turmoil in Asia.
And even some companies reporting favorable earnings have seen their stocks fall. Oil shares, for instance, were down sharply yesterday despite relatively strong earnings from Chevron and Texaco, and, the day before, from Exxon. The stocks were hit by concern over the falling price of crude oil, which dropped to the lowest price in more than three years yesterday.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 63.52 points, closing at 7,730.88. The Standard & Poor's 500 index slipped 7.74 points, to 963.04. The Nasdaq composite index fell 11.41 points, to 1,576.51.
The uncertainty about earnings reports has sent investors in search of places to limit their risk, rather than produce strong gains, said Thomas Galvin, chief equity strategist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.
"There's no common theme that investors have uniformly grasped," Mr. Galvin said, adding that he believes that as prospects for revenue growth decline, more companies will seek to increase earnings by consolidating. And undervalued companies in sectors such as telecommunications, waste, water filtration, hotels and casinos, and utilities could be good candidates, he said.
But as investors search for opportunities, they will have to continue to sidestep unexpected pitfalls such as the Asian crisis.
And some investors said that the latest trouble to hit the Clinton Administration -- allegations that President Clinton had had an affair with a White House intern and then sought to cover it up -- contributed to the negative tone in the markets by creating more political uncertainty.
"It's another imponderable," Hank Herrmann, chief investment officer at Waddell & Reed in Kansas City, Kan., said.
Investing in the stock market "is already difficult because of Asia, but you could see some negatives coming out of this that could impact the psychology of the market," he added.
Mr. Herrmann said he believed that bearish sentiment was fueled by investors' worries about the outcome of the investigation into whether Mr. Clinton obstructed justice. This may have contributed to the market's unenthusiastic response to those companies that managed to report on-target or better-than-expected earnings. "Very few stocks are making much progress on positive earnings surprises," he said.
Robert Froehlich, chief investment strategist at Scudder Kemper Investments, said, "No one knows just what it means to the market," but added that the allegations were clearly on some investors minds. "I haven't had one question on Indonesia, Thailand or the Asian markets, but I've had about 100 on Bill Clinton and what it's going to mean to the market," he said.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: CURRENCIES;
Currency Hits Record Low Vs. Dollar In Canada

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
A record number of American tourists are making overnight trips to Canada, and for good reason. The Canadian dollar has plunged 5 percent against the dollar since October and dropped to its lowest value ever yesterday, making trips north of the border much more affordable.
Despite intervention by the Bank of Canada to support the currency, the Canadian dollar fell to as low as 68.85 United States cents, or $1.4523 (Canadian) to the dollar. Its previous all-time low was 69.13 United States cents in February 1986. In late trading, the Canadian dollar rebounded a little, finishing at 69.22 United States cents, or $1.4445 (Canadian). 
 The swoon of the Canadian dollar comes despite a healthy Canadian economy, which is growing faster than the United States economy and has lower consumer inflation.
It reverses the business climate at the border from the beginning of the decade, when the Canadian currency reached a high of 89.26 United States cents and Canadians visited American shops and malls to buy brand names at bargain prices.
Now, said Mark Chandler, senior economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company in Toronto, "Canadians taking a vacation are going to think twice about about going to Florida."
But some of the forces pushing the Canadian dollar lower are products of strong growth with low inflation.
Rising consumer spending means that Canadians have picked up their buying of imports. At the same time, the values of key Canadian commodity exports -- forest products, precious metals and energy -- have declined sharply because of a general fall in commodity prices accelerated by the economic collapse in Asia, where demand for such goods has plummeted.
Together, these trends have helped turn a $3.6 billion current account surplus for 1996 to a $25.6 billion deficit, at an annual rate, in the third quarter of 1997. This swift move to a deficit weakens the currency by sending too many Canadian dollars out of the country, which are, in turn, sold by the foreign companies that receive them for their home currencies.
"Until we get a better trade number, we will not see a definitive turnaround" for the Canadian dollar, Mr. Chandler said.
Asia has also contributed to the more immediate downward pressure on the Canadian dollar. Currency traders had been expecting the Canadian economy to grow at a similar pace this year, which meant that the Bank of Canada, the nation's central bank, would be likely to raise interest rates to slow growth and restrain inflation. The higher interest rates would attract more foreign investors to Canadian securities, making them buy Canadian dollars.
But the drag on growth now expected from Asia may slow the economy enough so that the central bank can stand pat or even reduce short-term interest rates.
Bernard Bonin, the deputy governor of the central bank, hinted at such an outcome in a speech on Wednesday that helped send the Canadian dollar down to just above its record low. This could leave Canadian short-term interest rates at their less attractive position of one percentage point below comparable United States rates.
The central bank's new leaning was given more emphasis yesterday when the Government reported that consumer inflation rose just seven-tenths of a percent in 1997, meaning inflation is not much of an immediate threat.

HEADLINE: Administration Proposes Moratorium on New Logging Roads

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 22

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration proposed a moratorium today on building new logging roads into millions of acres of national forest for the next year and a half, but it exempted large areas of Alaska and the Pacific Northwest from the moratorium.
Forest Service officials said the suspension would effectively preclude logging on about 33 million acres of roadless back country that is unprotected as wilderness, including about nine million acres where the agency had been likely to approve logging roads in the coming year. About 5 percent of the agency's timber sales in 1988 would have to be deferred, the officials said. 
 During the suspension of road building, the Forest Service said it would develop a new, permanent strategy governing the vast network of more than 400,000 miles of roads that crisscross the publicly owned forests, often fragmenting wildlife habitats, aggravating erosion and damaging streams.
This is certain to intensify the debate between conservationists and logging interests over the nation's long-term forest policy.
The Forest Service's new policy is intended to protect roadless areas from undue environmental damage, to maintain the logging roads that already exist and to close tens of thousands of miles of deteriorating roads that are no longer needed.
Such an approach, depending on how it is written, could fundamentally alter the economics and ecology of forest management, officials said.
"We intend to work with the American people, Congress and the scientific community to develop a science-based forest transportation system," said Mike Dombeck, chief of the Forest Service.
Both the proposed moratorium and the long-term plan are subject to public comment before they become final.
The immediate reaction to the Administration's plan, which had been expected, centered on the moratorium on road building.
The moratorium does not apply to forests in the Pacific Northwest that were covered by an earlier compromise governing logging in the habitat of the spotted owl, a threatened species. Nor does it apply to the Tongass National Forest in Alaska or to eight other, smaller forests where logging plans have been revised recently and are under appeal.
"Only Washington bureaucrats would develop a national policy to protect roadless areas that leaves out America's biggest and wildest national forest," said Matt Zencey, campaign manager of the Alaska Rainforest Campaign, which seeks more protection for the Tongass.
Senator Larry E. Craig, the Idaho Republican who is chairman of the Forests and Public Land Management Subcommittee of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said the proposal would impose "horrendous economic costs" on people in his state, which has large areas of roadless national forest.
"You don't start a good-faith dialogue by first rolling a hand grenade under the door," Mr. Craig said.
Administration officials denied that the exemptions of a few forests were intended to satisfy Congressional critics, like the Alaskan delegation. Rather, they said, the recently written management plans for those forests are based on up-to-date science, and any additional protections for roadless areas there will be considered in the normal administrative appeals of those plans.

HEADLINE: THE POPE IN CUBA: IN THE COUNTRYSIDE;
Where's the Joy of Life? The Dirt Poor in Cuba Wonder

BYLINE: By MIRTA OJITO 

DATELINE: RANCHO VELOZ, Cuba, Jan. 22

 BODY:
Eight-year-old Yanela Nemer, who wants to be a ballerina, left her home before dawn today wearing her only pair of dressy shoes. The shoes, black patent with a bow, are reserved for special occasions like the trip to Santa Clara to see John Paul II today.
For everything else, from going to school to playing in the streets of this muddy speck of a town 55 miles north of Santa Clara in central Cuba, Yanela wears sneakers that were once navy blue. Now they are faded and stained, a result of too much wear and her mother's inability to find detergent. 
 "Detergent, real, real detergent, well I just can't remember how long it's been," said her mother, Elba Gonzalez, 36, who does remember the last time she ate steak. It was three years ago.
Ms. Gonzalez also knows, down to the last cent, how much she needs to buy all the things she cannot have: $2.85 for liquid soap, $2.30 for cooking oil and $10 to buy her daughter another pair of dressy shoes.
All these things are available in a store just a stone's throw from her spacious colonial home. Yet they are woefully out of reach because to buy them she needs dollars. And in the countryside of Cuba, in towns so remote that once the lights are out you cannot see your own hands, dollars are very hard to come by.
For people who live here and in the two other provinces where the Pope will hold Masses outside Havana, life is a grinding series of compromises, sacrifices and mind-bending transactions that leave many, like Ms. Gonzalez, with a permanent dull headache.
"We wake up in a bad mood and go to sleep in a bad mood," said Ms. Gonzalez, a mother of three who is married to a man who works selling fritters from a state-owned street car. She lives in the home of her father-in-law, a member of the Communist Party who defended Cuba during the Bay of Pigs invasion and against the rebels who sought to topple the Castro Government in the early years of the revolution.
"Sometimes," she said, "I wonder why I have this absence of joy, of happiness," adding as she pointed to her children's feet, "This is why." Her youngest son, Sandro, 7, has only one pair of shoes. Her daughter needs orthopedic shoes to correct a congenital malformation, but the family cannot afford them.
There are basically two ways to make a living here, as a campesino or in one of the few Government jobs available, selling bread in the store or teaching in the local schools. The campesinos work fields of their own or those owned by the Government, planting beans, rice, corn, sweet potato or sugar cane and tending cows and sheep.
Campesinos are thought to have a better life only because they have more access to food. And yet even they say that putting food on their tables every day is a constant struggle. Nature -- it rains too much or it does not rain at all -- and the almost total control the Government exerts over the land and the cattle conspire against them.
Antonio Veliz is 75 and goes to work every day on his finca, or farm, 49 acres he owns about an hour away from his home in Rancho Veloz. So calloused are his hands that his fingerprints have all but disappeared and his fingers are so cracked and mangled that it is difficult to shake hands with him.
He said the Government required that he dedicate about half of his land to sugar cane. He must prepare the fields, plant the cane, water it and fertilize it. When the cane is ready, the Government sends a brigade of men to cut it and haul it away. For his efforts, which take about a year, he was recently paid 266 pesos and 99 cents, about $12 at the current rate of exchange.
On the rest of the land Mr. Veliz can grow what he chooses and use it for his own consumption. Any products he has left over he can sell in a produce market, but he has to pay a tax to the Government. He has 20 cows, which he tends and milks every day. But he must sell the milk to the state, a liter daily per cow, at 36 cents per liter. If he is caught selling it to someone else, he can be fined, he said.
What bothers him the most, as a lifelong owner of land, is that he cannot kill his own cows, he said. If a cow dies or is killed by someone else, he must report it immediately to the Government. The cows are checked regularly by Government inspectors, who brand each of them with metal clips attached to the ears. The clips have numbers, which are recorded in government files.
Mr. Veliz can always raise and kill pigs, sheep and chickens. But that has become an expensive proposition. If he leaves them on his finca they will most likely be stolen by people even hungrier than he is. In the last years, he has lost 66 sheep, 36 turkeys and 12 pigs worth 50,000 pesos ($2,174).
Now he keeps his pigs in the homes of his children who have backyards. At night, though, they must take them inside and keep them in the bathroom for fear of theft. It takes about seven months of daily feedings and proper care to raise a pig succulent enough to eat.
"You see that there?" asked Mr. Veliz, pointing to a small, sickly looking pig his neighbor owns. "That is his only hope. But it will take a long time before he can put it on the table."
While the pigs fatten, most people survive on a diet of rice and beans, sweet potato and an occasional egg. Today, for a long day of work at his finca, Mr. Veliz packed a lunch of rice and black beans and two small sandwiches of green tomatoes.
The Cuban Government readily acknowledges that life here can be difficult. At a news conference in Havana this week, the Minister of the Economy, Jose Luis Rodriguez, said the difficulties should be attributed not only to the lack of dollars but also to the nature of life in the countryside. Historically, this has been especially difficult in Cuba.
"Lamentably, not all places have the same possibilities to attract tourism," Mr. Rodriguez said, adding that since the revolution the Government had invested heavily in the countryside to try to eradicate the abysmal differences between the provinces and the capital. "But like everything else, you have to give it time."
A study recently prepared by Cepal, an independent pan-American group that studies economies in Latin America, found that the provinces of Havana, Matanzas, Cienfuegos and Holguin had a "good" economic situation, while the provinces of Villa Clara, where this city is located, Sancti Spiritus, Ciego de Avila, Camaguey and Isla de la Juventud were in a "not so good situation." The rest of the provinces were in "adverse" situations.
But it is hard for the people of Rancho Veloz and a host of other small places bordering the north coast to imagine who can possibly be worse off than they are.
Madelyn Mazorra, a 26-year-old secretary, said it was impossible for her family to live off their salaries, totaling the equivalent of about $18 a month. To make ends meet, her mother, who works in a Government-owned bakery, must scurry around town on her day off buying items that she can later exchange for food. Because her mother does not smoke, once a week she exchanges two packs of cigarettes for six small fish in a fishing village about half an hour away.
Another woman, so thin that the joints in her arms were easily visible, said she made cheese at home (10 pesos per pound) from the milk produced by her husband's cows. She declined to give her name for fear of Government reprisal. Selling cheese to neighbors is a problem because doing so is a tip-off that the cows are producing more milk than the Government is aware of.
When she has enough pesos, she travels to a town where there is a money exchange and buys dollars. With the dollars she buys everything else her family needs, from toilet paper to deodorant.
It has been a while since she made a trip to the city. In her house there was no toilet paper, shampoo or soap. She washed a cup in hot water to offer coffee to a visitor. The water comes from a tank she keeps in the kitchen because for the last two days no water has flowed from the faucets.
The Rev. Raul Rodriguez, the priest who serves Rancho Veloz and three other towns in this region, said most of the people he tended to were very poor. He helps them with money he receives from the church in Cuba and from friends who live abroad. Once a year he travels to the United States to strengthen the ties between Cuban exiles and his people, but also, he admits, to seek donations.
"The spiritual side is my mission," said Father Rodriguez, 34, who travels 24 miles daily to visit his dispersed flock and 24 miles back to his home in Quemado de Guines. "But I also have to worry about the daily realities of life."
These days, he said, he has been busier than ever, coordinating the needs of 800 people who were to travel from his towns to see the Pope in Santa Clara.
Understanding that many people will not have enough to eat, the Communist Party here served breakfast at 3 A.M. before the buses left. They charged one peso per person, less than 5 cents.
The priest was happy with the arrangement and so were children like Yanela Nemer. With the breakfast, the Government promised sweet snacks. And it had been a long time since Yanela and his mother had such a treat.

HEADLINE: Comptroller Forecasts 2d Big Surplus

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY 

 BODY:
For the second year in a row, city auditors are projecting that the city will end its fiscal year with more than a $1 billion surplus, a larger-than-expected windfall being generated by factors ranging from rising tax collections to a drop in the number of people on welfare.
But City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, whose office issued a report yesterday announcing the surplus, tempered some of the glee in City Hall by warning that much of the extra money should be set aside to offset the $2.5 billion annual shortfall his office is predicting for the city by the millennium, when revenues from Wall Street and tourism may be less robust. 
 Nevertheless, city officials said that the projection of a $1.1 billion surplus reflected the continued strength of Wall Street and a rise in the city's real estate market, both of which increase city tax revenues.
And it came as welcome news to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who often grappled with the most basic of budgetary problems -- expenses exceeding revenues -- in the early years of his first administration.
Joseph J. Lhota, the Mayor's Budget Director, said that Mr. Hevesi's projection was "in the ball park" of the administration's own estimates, and he cited the surplus as the payoff for the Mayor's fiscal discipline.
Mr. Lhota said that the Mayor would explain next week how he planned to use the extra money when he announced his preliminary budget for the next fiscal year, which begins on July 1.
According to the Comptroller's office, most of the money is coming from the collection of taxes, which are $767.3 million higher than the amount projected in the city budget that was adopted last June. Much of that increase comes from rising property tax revenues.
But other sources, including those that might not be immediately obvious, contributed to the surplus. Some 29,000 fewer people are collecting welfare payments than expected, saving the city about $20 million.
The city is selling bonds at interest rates that are the lowest in decades. It collected $10 million more than expected in rent from Kennedy International and La Guardia Airports, $3.5 million more in parking-violation fines and $3.7 million more from parking meters.
Offsetting some of the surplus were disappointing returns in other areas.
For example, the city collected $6.9 million less than expected in moving-violation fines.
Still, the overall picture pleased many officials, including Thomas L. McMahon, the City Council's finance director. "The Comptroller's estimate is in line with our projections and reflects the relative strength of the city economy," he said.
He added that Peter F. Vallone, the Council Speaker, indicated in his state-of-the-city speech earlier this month that the Council would seek to spend most of the surplus on education and tax reductions.
Last year, officials say, the city used its $1.4 billion surplus to pay off principal and interest on the city's debt and to offset some of the revenue lost from tax cuts.
It still managed to have some money left over for various spending programs.
But, as is his custom as the city's financial watchdog, Mr. Hevesi issued a reminder that "this revenue source is temporary" and that most budget analysts remained concerned about the effect that any slowdown on Wall Street might have on the city.

December Housing Starts Fell, But Were Strong for Full Year

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 22

 BODY:
Housing starts fell in December, the Commerce Department said today, but not enough to prevent 1997 from being a strong year for builders.
Housing starts slipped eight-tenths of a percent in December, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.52 million. For the year, builders began construction on 1.48 million units, just 1,100 short of the 1996 total, which marked an eight-year high. 
 As 1997 began, most analysts were looking for a slowdown in housing. But unexpectedly vigorous job growth, reducing the unemployment rate to a 24-year low, along with stock market gains gave Americans the wherewithal to buy homes. And lower mortgage rates, made home-buying more affordable.
Mortgage rates edged below 7 percent as 1998 began. They hit a four-year low of 6.89 percent last week and ticked up to 6.99 percent this week, according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. That has caused a record number of mortgage applications, the Mortgage Bankers Association of America said. Applications last week were 277 percent higher than the corresponding week a year ago. Refinancings accounted for 69 percent of the total.
"We're getting off to a running start, but you can't sustain this type of pace forever," said David Lereah, an economist at the association.
On average, analysts are looking for a 3 percent drop in starts, to 1.44 million, in 1998.
The Labor Department said yesterday that first-time claims for unemployment benefits fell by 13,000, to 326,000 last week. But that followed three consecutive increases. And a four-week moving average of claims, which smooths weekly fluctuations, moved up to 329,000, a six-month high. Analysts believe this hints at softness.

It Could Be Very Last Super Bowl

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY 

 BODY:
STOCK up on your munchies and your drinks and gape at the Super Bowl on Sunday. We're going to miss it when it's gone.
I hear the animals outside in the back 40, lowing and mooing and pawing at the ground. They can feel the seismic plates grinding together deep under their feet. 
 We are about to suffer the Big One, caused by the new television deal that doubled the income of the National Football League through 2005. If there is a 2005.
The whole thing is going to blow. Escalating greed is going to take it all down, the leagues and the networks and the millionaire players.
Superficially, it would seem that the new $17.6 billion contract among four major networks would loosen up enough money for every football player in the land to be able to afford his next round of steroids as well as a new coat for the missus. But sports economy does not work that way. Probably no economy works that way.
Back when I was growing up in the picturesque coal valleys of central Queens, we used to say that the miners spent every pay raise twice -- once when it was announced, once when it actually appeared in his paycheck. It's human nature.
As far as I can see, when CBS splurged to get back into the football business, it raised the ante for three other networks, which included very ordinary football players' getting unbelievable raises, and a rookie broadcaster like Boomer Esiason finding networks fighting over him. (And don't think that players in other sports are not watching this madness; Bernie Williams's demands upon the Yankees probably went up another million because of the excesses of that other sport.)
This apocalyptic spiral can only get worse. Teams will be spending money to keep even with the other teams, the way paranoid linemen gobble down their steroids -- not only because they want to give themselves ludicrous bodies and hideous medical futures, but also because they are immediately afraid of the wild-eyed maniac on the opposite side of the line.
Even though the N.F.L. shares the swag evenly, and has implemented a cap to try to keep salaries down, every team will try to maintain its financial edge by putting in new luxury boxes.
Actually, with the proliferation of television timeouts, it makes no sense to sit in the stands. I went to a football game this season, and it was pouring in San Francisco as the fans huddled while the networks hawked high-octane pickup trucks designed to kill people in smaller gas-saving four-cylinder compacts. It would have been far better to be partying it up in a luxury box, ingesting the shrimp and the sushi and hitting on the white wine in the three or four minutes between snaps of the ball.
With luxury boxes de rigueur these days, municipalities will be under greater pressure to raise taxes or run a referendum to keep the team from bolting. At the same time, the friendly folks from the networks are not just tossing away money because they love pro football. In fact, their sponsors are going to raise the price on tooth-rotting colas, the stomach-curdling fast food, the intoxicating beers and the lethal pickups.
Who is actually paying for the awesome price increase the networks have been tossing out? Up to now, you are, dummy. And like my old buddies in the coal mines in central Queens, you are paying twice -- once as a consumer via higher prices, once as a fan via higher ticket prices.
A few years ago I used to think that sport was going down because low-rent teams like the Pittsburgh Pirates or Edmonton Oilers or New Jersey Nets could not afford the cost of being dreadful. But I've changed my mind. I now think the fans are the weak link.
In Madison Square Garden, the fans are already looking sullen if not rebellious. Part of it is the uninspired hockey and basketball being committed there, but more to the point are the ghastly prices being charged by whoever owns the Garden these days. At contemporary ticket prices, you need a Mookie at-bat every night, you need a Stanley Cup every night, you need an immaculate reception every game, you need Master Jordan thwacking somebody every night.
I see what my friends and the readers are paying for their tickets. I don't think they are going to support the next wave of price increases that the CBS gold rush will create.
The plates are rubbing together under the ground. The end is coming. Repent while there is time. The best way to repent is to not renew your season tickets.

HEADLINE: The Wrong Place for Queen Catherine

 BODY:
There is no comprehensive Who's Who of those involved in the trans-Atlantic slave trade. But even if one existed, it is highly unlikely that Queen Catherine of Braganza, a Portuguese noblewoman who became the wife of England's Charles II, would merit a separate entry. As far as historians can tell, she played no active role but was a member of two royal families that chartered and sought to profit from companies involved in the slave trade.
The historians' verdict should help the Queens Borough President, Claire Shulman, settle the dispute over a plan to erect a statue of Queen Catherine facing the United Nations from the Queens waterfront. Proponents, who spent 10 years raising more than $1 million for the project, believe Catherine deserves a statue because Queens is named for her, among other reasons. The opponents, a diverse group led by blacks in Queens, believe that she is disqualified by her association, however tangential, with slavery. 
 But all this squabbling overlooks a larger question. Why award a prominent spot on New York's waterfront to a large memorial, one-third the height of the Statue of Liberty, to a monarch who is really only a footnote in borough history and the history of this democracy? Catherine herself, though a figure of prominence in Portugal's struggle to remain independent of Spain, and a Catholic who championed the interests of English Catholics during a time of great religious strife, played no role in the settlement of Queens.
It may be perfectly appropriate to display Queen Catherine in another location, public or private, assuming that Ms. Shulman can resolve the slavery argument. But before a valuable piece of New York's skyline is turned over to Catherine or anyone else, city and state officials ought to form a committee of prominent historians and others to see who most deserves the space. Surely the city's rich cultural, social and economic history could turn up someone more worthy of the honor.
Besides, this property does not technically belong to Queens. It belongs to the Port Authority, which is yet another argument for a broad committee of experts who can cast a wide net for possible candidates. The whole question of commemorative statuary -- who goes where, and why -- deserves the same rigorous intellectual review that New Yorkers routinely apply to their great museums and other cultural institutions.

Indonesia Currency Falls Hard, Clouding Recovery

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, Friday, Jan. 23

 BODY:
A week after Indonesia agreed to stringent new austerity measures that increased hope somewhat for Asian economic stability, this country's currency plummeted Thursday and again this morning, to new lows that roiled other Asian markets and threw into question the prospects for Indonesian recovery.
The fall beyond all expectations of the currency, the rupiah, over the last week -- to about 20 percent of its value six months ago -- raised fears that a $40 billion rescue package organized by the International Monetary Fund would be inadequate. It kindled worries, as well, that a crushing burden of foreign debt could slow the economy to a standstill. 
 The damage to the Indonesian economy has heightened political and social tensions here, two months before President Suharto is expected to be named to a seventh term after 32 years in power.
At one point here on Thursday, the rupiah fell to a rate of 16,500 to the dollar before the central bank intervened to sell dollars, and the Indonesian currency recovered much of the loss, finishing the day at 12,000, compared with 11,550 on Wednesday.
This morning, stocks rose somewhat here, gaining 1.2 percent. But the rupiah was substantially lower -- losing nearly 14 percent of its value, to trade at a rate of 13,900 to the dollar.
In stark contrast, the Indonesian currency sold for 5,400 to the dollar as recently as the end of last month and 2,500 to the dollar in July. The rupiah's value was so far from its recent moorings that a local businessman dubbed it a "virtual currency," its value just a mirage.
The plunge in the rupiah means that Indonesia's $65 billion in private, dollar-denominated debt has swelled to exchange levels that borrowers cannot afford to repay, with far more rupiah required to buy dollars than before.
That has raised the possibility of mass bankruptcies or a possible moratorium from creditors on Indonesian debt payment. Some analysts here estimate that all but 22 of the nation's 228 publicly traded companies have liabilities that exceed assets.
The banking system is virtually paralyzed, and almost no loans are being granted.
Mr. Suharto, in a meeting on Thursday with Deputy Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura of Japan, repeated his ministers' assertion that the Government would not bail out debt-burdened companies.
But financial analysts said any agreement to reschedule such debts would be far more complicated than it has been in South Korea, where most debts are owed by a relatively small number of big banks.
By contrast, they said, the debt here is scattered among hundreds of corporations and is hard to tally because of weak financial-reporting requirements.
In Washington on Thursday, Clinton Administration officials declined to comment on the Indonesian currency's slide. But in recent days they have kept up gentle public pressure on Mr. Suharto to follow through on his commitments to the I.M.F., with Secretary of the Treasury Robert E. Rubin saying on Wednesday that "continued and sustained adherence" to the I.M.F. program would be necessary to restore stability.
Political uncertainty is the second major problem in restoring confidence in this country's economy. The fall of the rupiah was spurred this week by hints from Mr. Suharto that he would name a longtime aide, B. J. Habibie, as his Vice President at the electoral assembly in March.
Mr. Habibie is widely distrusted by investors because of his unorthodox economic views and record of fostering expensive and unrealistic projects, including a home-grown aircraft-assembly project that has been shelved under the new I.M.F. austerity measures.
Mr. Suharto, 76, said on Tuesday that he would accept another term, virtually insuring his re-election despite growing discontent with his rule. Because of his age and his refusal to establish a clear succession process, investors are increasingly wary of placing bets on the future stability of Indonesia, the world's fourth-most-populous nation.
"With Habibie as a possible successor, it is difficult to have any credibility in the I.M.F. package," said Neil Saker, an analyst with Societe Generale Crosby Securities in Singapore. "He has his own projects that the I.M.F. is attacking. Basically, he has reversed the I.M.F. euphoria. At this point, there's no reason to think the rupiah will strengthen. The risks are all on the downside."
Such sentiments can be heard these days from virtually any financial analyst. Nevertheless, a senior I.M.F. official said on Thursday that investors were overreacting. Stanley Fischer, the lending agency's deputy managing director, said in Washington that the rupiah and other Asian currencies had fallen "far more than is warranted or desirable."
A Japanese vice trade minister, Osamu Watanabe, also struck a note of cautious optimism on Thursday, telling reporters in Tokyo that the rupiah could recover if Indonesia strictly adhered to the conditions imposed by the I.M.F.
The Indoesian currency had been relatively stable, until a sharp decline in the Thai currency that started in July set off a chain reaction of devaluations through much of Asia.
When Indonesia, at the start of the year, announced a budget based on an exchange rate of 4,000 rupiah to the dollar, its forecasts were seen as wildly unrealistic. But when the I.M.F. negotiated a new exchange-rate projection with the Government last week, that estimate was set at a level that now seems mournfully inadequate: 5,000 to the dollar.
The troubles here have become a major concern for other Asian countries, where trade and investments have been wounded by the Indonesian slump and fears have grown of wider economic contagion.
The plunge in the rupiah helped drag down stock markets around Asia on Thursday, in what financial analysts described as widespread anxiety over Indonesia's unchecked slide.
But the rupiah's depreciation has not been accompanied by the panic buying that gripped Indonesia early this month when the currency first fell below 10,000 to the dollar, even though commercial banks in Jakarta have reported long lines of customers seeking to withdraw their money.
Security was tight on Thursday as the Jakarta police began deploying 14,000 more officers around the capital in advance of Id al-Fitr, the holiday next week that ends the Muslim fasting month, Ramadan. Most of Indonesia's 200 million people are Muslims.
At the personal level, the worsening economy has begun to bite in increasingly harsh ways -- with rising prices and increasing job losses that raise the risk of social unrest. Prices for rice, a staple, have doubled or tripled in some places.
The twin problems of the debt crisis and of political uncertainty were not addressed in the I.M.F. austerity package, which Mr. Suharto signed under intense international pressure and which are certain to intensify unemployment, inflation and bankruptcies.
But economists agree that the strictures are essential to bring some order to Indonesia's economy, which has been skewed by cronyism, corruption and monopolies, and by price supports.

HEADLINE: AT&T Chief Said to Plan Big Job Cuts

BYLINE: By SETH SCHIESEL 

 BODY:
Union leaders and senior executives at the AT&T Corporation, the nation's largest telecommunications carrier, said yesterday that they expected the company to announce on Monday that it intended to cut its work force by about 15,000 employees, or roughly 12 percent.
The job cuts would be the biggest step yet by AT&T's new chairman, C. Michael Armstrong, as he tries to remake the company into a slim, fast-moving operator after decades of relative sluggishness. 
 Mr. Armstrong has made no secret of his contempt for AT&T's traditionally flabby management structure and has said that he wants the company, whose stock is the most widely owned in the country, to have the lowest costs in the highly competitive telecommunications arena.
The wide job cuts may be accompanied by a shake-up of senior management. Yesterday Jeffrey Weitzen, head of AT&T's unit that serves business customers, announced that he would leave the company after 18 years to become president of Gateway 2000 Inc., the personal computer maker.
AT&T's previous chairman, Robert E. Allen, had pointed to Mr. Weitzen and to his counterpart in the consumer unit, Gail McGovern, as paragons of AT&T's management vigor. But both executives had seen their responsibilities curtailed recently as control over AT&T's network was shifted away from them and toward a separate network group, according to people close to the changes.
Ms. McGovern, who has a strong background in marketing, has been rumored to be considering a position with Pepsico Inc. AT&T has denied those reports.
AT&T spends more of its revenues on administrative costs than do most of its competitors. The telecommunications industry, one of the nation's largest, is being rocked by regulatory changes and waves of corporate takeovers. Amid the turmoil, AT&T wants to be able to spend more money on growth opportunities while being able to match the prices of its leaner competitors.
It was unclear yesterday whether most of the cuts would come through attrition, voluntary buyouts or layoffs. It was also unclear how many of the cuts would be made in New Jersey, where AT&T has its headquarters in Basking Ridge.
AT&T declined to comment officially yesterday. But senior executives said on condition of anonymity that they expected the company to announce job cuts on Monday. That day AT&T also plans to release its latest financial results and to stage a big meeting in New York City between top management, including Mr. Armstrong, and Wall Street analysts.
A spokeswoman for the Communications Workers of America, the union that represents about 40 percent of AT&T's 128,000 employees, said the union believed that the company would eliminate about 15,000 jobs, mostly in management.
Mr. Armstrong has said that he wants to reduce the company's annual selling, general and administrative costs by $4 billion to $5 billion, or down to about 20 percent of annual revenues. In 1996, the last full year for which AT&T has announced financial results, the company spent $14.8 billion, or 28.3 percent, of its $52.2 billion in revenues on selling, general and administrative costs.
In 1996 MCI Communications, the No. 2 long-distance carrier after AT&T, spent 27.2 percent of its revenues on those costs while the next-largest long-distance companies, Sprint and Worldcom, spent 22.5 percent and 18.5 percent, respectively.
Mr. Armstrong may like to reduce AT&T's administrative spending to Worldcom's range, but few analysts believe such hopes are realistic. That is because Worldcom, which serves business customers almost exclusively, does not have to employ the large customer service staff required by a company like AT&T, which makes most of its sales to residential consumers.
But most analysts agree that Mr. Armstrong can squeeze some savings out of the company he joined last fall, and that some of the juice will come in the form of lost jobs.
"You can't cut those kinds of dollars without cutting jobs," said Frank Governali, a telecommunications analyst for Credit Suisse First Boston. "It's really, really simple. Here's a company that's the largest operator in the long-distance industry by a factor of two and it's an industry that has a high level of operating leverage -- in other words, economies of scale. It just does not make any sense that AT&T has the most expensive cost structure."
First Boston advised AT&T during its $11.3 billion acquisition of Teleport Communications Group Inc. earlier this month.
Financial analysts estimate that each AT&T employee costs the company about $90,000 a year, so eliminating 15,000 jobs could save about $1.4 billion a year after one-time charges to cover the costs of the cuts.
But Wall Street is bound to take any job elimination announcement from AT&T with a grain of skepticism.
In January 1996, AT&T announced that it would cut 40,000 jobs over the next three years. Seventeen thousand of those cuts were to come in what would remain AT&T while 23,000 were scheduled for the company's equipment operation, which was spun off as Lucent Technologies Inc. later that year.
But two years after that announcement AT&T today has roughly 1,000 more employees than it had when the cuts were announced. While the company did go through with many of the planned reductions, it hired even more people to bolster AT&T in new areas like wireless communications and the Internet.
As AT&T seeks to build on its Teleport acquisition and expand into the local telephone market, the company could feel a similar countervailing pressure this year as well.
But yesterday that did not dampen the spirits of investors, who seized on rumors of the looming job cuts with hope that some of the savings would be passed on to them. Matching their highest closing price in a year, AT&T's shares rose 50 cents, to $68.625 yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Fraying Alliance: Iraq Sees Sanction Backers Divided

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Jan. 22

 BODY:
In an orchestrated series of steps during the last week, President Saddam Hussein has sent the world an unmistakable message: Seven years after the Persian Gulf war, Iraq is going to extricate itself from economic sanctions, with or without permission from the United Nations Security Council.
The signals from Iraqi officials here are very clear. The next two or three months will be the most critical tests of American, British and United Nations resolve that Iraq has posed since it was put under international supervision for bad behavior in August 1990 after it invaded Kuwait. 
 On Friday, Richard Butler, the executive chairman of the United Nations Special Commission, which has been working since 1991 to rid Iraq of weapons of mass destruction, is to report to the Security Council on his visit to Baghdad this week.
The news will not be good, especially for the Clinton Administration, now in the throes of its most damaging domestic crisis. The opportunity of the moment is not lost on the Iraqi leadership.
Mr. Butler came here with what he called "blindingly obvious" news for the Iraqis. The Security Council had instructed him to demand unconditional access to any place in this country that weapons inspectors wanted to go.
The demand was simply brushed aside by Iraq. Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz told Mr. Butler that Iraq would no longer be willing to deal with "cops." Instead, Mr. Aziz gave Mr. Butler a definitive list of eight areas that were off limits, some of them huge.
Moreover, President Hussein declared that Iraq was in a state of jihad -- holy war -- with the United States, and ordered military training for a million citizens.
Mr. Aziz told Mr. Butler that there should be no more talk of access to presidential properties or other sites that the Iraqis have labeled "sensitive" -- and no more requests to inspect them -- until after three newly designated teams of United Nations technical experts weighed the file on Iraqi compliance on missile warheads, chemical weapons and germ warfare.
Iraq already considers the nuclear file effectively closed. All four areas must be declared disarmed by Mr. Butler's commission before sanctions can be lifted.
The technical teams are to begin meeting here on Feb. 1. They are expected to report to Mr. Butler a month later. He in turn is to tell the Security Council by early April how far Iraq has come in meeting the disarmament requirements. At that point the Council will decide whether to continue sanctions for another six months.
The Iraqis hope that this path will lead to their release from an embargo that has hurt many people -- including the leadership, which cannot expect to go on building itself magnificent palaces without a renewed oil income. Millions of other Iraqis no longer care who benefits from a release from sanctions as long as they can again eat and buy their children clothes and medicine.
Iraqi officials seem to believe that the United States has never been in a weaker position in the Security Council. Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright has been less aggressive in her approaches to the Iraqi problem than she was as the chief American delegate to the United Nations, when she could talk down and even ridicule many of Baghdad's ploys.
The United States would have a far more difficult time winning support for military attacks on Iraq, many diplomats say. Washington is crippling the United Nations financially by not paying its dues, a measure of the low priority the Clinton Administration has put on the need for international support there, many United Nations officials and diplomats say.
At the same time, some countries have big financial and commercial interests in an unfettered Iraq, especially France and Russia. Other diplomats are also jostling for attention here now, perhaps sensing that sanctions may crack.
Diplomats here and at the United Nations trace the shift on Iraq's part to early last fall, when President Hussein tried again -- and failed again -- to declare unilaterally that Iraq was free of prohibited weapons. American attempts to add new sanctions also failed, however, and that seems to have been seen as a green light in Baghdad.
The crisis over Iraq's decision to bar American arms inspectors followed in October, costing the United Nations Special Commission three weeks of lost work.
Although Russia eventually persuaded Iraq to back down, the scene had been set for further confrontations. To this day, diplomats say, they are not sure what Russia promised the Iraqis in return, but high among Baghdad's demands was a proportional reduction in American inspectors -- and a reduced role for the commission headed by Mr. Butler, an outspoken Australian disarmament expert.
The Iraqis persuaded Secretary General Kofi Annan to send a team of troubleshooters not drawn from the Security Council or its creation, the Special Commission, to discuss last fall's inspection crisis. Now Iraq has broadened the panel of technical experts who will examine the files on its weapons programs.
Instead of expert teams chosen by the Special Commission, there will be panels including Iraqis, commission members and nominees of six countries: Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States. What to an outsider might seem an insignificant change is to Iraqis a fundamental shift in principle.
When Mr. Butler was asked at a news conference here on Wednesday whether Iraq's demand for a freeze on access to suspect sites put it in clear violation of the Security Council resolution -- which in this case can be enforced militarily -- he explained why he could not even comment.
"This is a tough political environment right now," he said, "and that's a decision the Security Council will have to make."

Software Industry Growth

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

 BODY:
The software industry in the New York metropolitan region expects to post strong revenues during the next few years, according to a study released this week by KPMG Peat Marwick, an accounting firm.
In a survey of about 200 software companies, respondents said they were expecting revenue growth of 40 percent this year and 61 percent over the next two to three years. 
 "These software companies derive 60 percent of their revenue from the export of products and services outside the region," said Len Sturm, a partner at KPMG. "Consequently, they are bringing revenue back into the area, and this strengthens the local economy and creates the need for highly skilled, high-paying jobs."
About half, 54 percent, of the survey's respondents said they also believe that being in New York City gives them an edge over their competitors, citing the proximity to customers and major markets and the availability of qualified technical personnel. NICK RAVO

HEADLINE: The Budget's Best Friend

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Your excellent Jan. 19 news article discussing credit for balancing the budget omits a crucial factor: Social Security. Since 1983 the program has rung up substantial surpluses, in recent years from $50 billion to $70 billion. Without Social Security's excess of collections over payout, the budget would not balance. 
 This development results from 1983 legislation based on recommendations of the National Commission on Social Security Reform, for which I was a consultant. Because of these surpluses, the United States borrows less, driving down interest rates for both government and private business, thereby encouraging more private investment. That feeds economic growth, generating more incometax revenue and enhancing the budget surplus.

HEADLINE: Science Confronts The Unknowable;
Less Is Known Than People Think

BYLINE: By SARAH BOXER 

 BODY:
Many scientists are not fond of the idea that there are things in the universe beyond their grasp. They do not even like the word unknowable and prefer to use the term intractable instead. They consider the idea of unknowability an admission of defeat or an invitation for an attack on science.
Recently, though, some scientists have made unknowability their business. Last summer the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation gave some $1.5 million in grants to researchers in different fields -- economics, oceanography, historical linguistics, computer science, population genetics, cell biology, anthropology and the history of science -- to take stock of what is known, unknown and unknowable. 
 "We are all taught what is known, but we rarely learn about what is not known, and we almost never learn about the unknowable," Ralph E. Gomory, the president of the Sloan Foundation, wrote in Scientific American in 1995. "Because of such lessons, we grow up thinking more is known than actually is," and we do not recognize the unknowables for what they are. That is why the average gambler always loses out to the average casino owner. "The gambler attempts to predict the individual and unpredictable spins of the roulette wheel," Mr. Gomory wrote, while "the owner concerns himself with the quite predictable average outcome."
This is not the first time the depths of unknowability have been plumbed. As John D. Barrow, an astronomy professor at the University of Sussex, writes in "Impossibility: The Limits of Science and the Science of Limits" (Oxford, coming in April), Heisenberg's uncertainty principle showed that you cannot simultaneously know the position and momentum of a subatomic particle. Einstein's cosmic speed limit put a cap on the transmission of information in the universe. And Godel's theorem proved that any mathematical system that is powerful enough to be interesting will contain statements that cannot be proved true or false inside that system.
More recently, chaos theorists have looked at phenomena like dripping faucets and long-term weather patterns, and showed how tiny inevitable fluctuations in those chaotic systems quickly snowball in unpredictable ways. Complexity theorists have shown that complicated systems, like embryos and economies, add up to more than the sum of their parts.
Now unknowability itself seems to be coming of age, or at least coming into some money.
So what is an example of something unknowable? Take the diet of a given person living in a French village in the year 1300. "You may know on average what his diet was," said Jesse Ausubel, the program officer of the Sloan Foundation. "But you cannot say what he ate on Dec. 15, 1300." The same goes for future climates. You may be able to say what the average temperature of the earth's atmosphere will be in 2030, but you cannot know what it will be in New York City.
The study of unknowability in each discipline offers a glimpse of how different scientists approach the boundaries of their own fields. In anthropology, the limits to knowledge can be determined by practical barriers. If a group of people refuses to perform a ritual while an outsider is watching, that ritual is, in a sense, unknowable. In the history of science, knowledge about a certain problem can be limited by illegible handwriting or some other fluke. No one will ever know, for example, exactly how Fermat proved his last theorem (that xn + yn = zn has no solution in which n is a positive whole number greater than 2) because, by his own admission, the margin of his page was "too narrow to contain" the solution.
In ecology, unknowability is a problem of scale. If, for example, one wants to see the effect of environmental changes on a forest, one literally has a choice between looking at the forest and looking at the trees.
Simon Levin, a biologist at Princeton University who has received part of the Sloan's unknowability grant, said that in looking at the climate's effect on the forest, "not every detail of every tree is important." What the study of unknowability can help reveal is how much detail you can leave out about individual trees without compromising your knowledge of the whole forest. Or, say you are starting with a single tree. As Dr. Levin points out, each tree will react differently to environmental changes and to other trees, and that tree's reaction in turn will have an effect on the climate. So, how much can you extrapolate from that one tree about the whole forest?
When it comes to unknowability in historical linguistics, time is the enemy. To name the unknowable is to name a date beyond which the past is irretrievably lost. According to Colin Renfrew, an archeologist at Cambridge University who is another recipient of a Sloan grant, the first direct evidence of language is from around 3000 B.C. because that's when writing began, in the Near East. So if you want to see what language was like before then, you run up against the boundary of what is knowable.
By comparing contemporary Indo-European languages (including English, Spanish, French and German), linguists have reconstructed what they call proto-Indo-European, a precursor to all Indo-European languages, Dr. Renfrew said. That takes us back to 5,000 years ago.
But pushing back the date further requires help from other fields. For example, Dr. Renfrew said, we know that languages spread when populations shift. That means archeology should say something about language. And DNA studies tell us a great deal about how populations are related, going back some 30,000 years. The problem is, "it is difficult to correlate data from different fields," Dr. Renfrew said. "There is always the possibility of dubious interpretations," which gets more and more likely the further back in time you go. That's why most linguists accept that we can see back at least 5,000 years, but few think we can detect the echoes of a hypothetical first language some 80,000 years ago.
In population genetics, unknowability is a matter of complexity. Say you know everything about the genetic makeup of a morning glory and everything about the behavior or ethology of its prime pollinator, the bumblebee. How much could you predict about the flower's evolution?
According to Mike Klegg, a population geneticist at the University of California at Riverside who is part of Sloan's unknowability project, we know the enzymatic reactions, the metabolic pathways that lead to the production of color in a flower. We know somewhat less about the genes involved in regulating those pathways. On the other end, we know something about how the bumblebee reacts to different colors: for example, it avoids albino morning glories. If we were to take the whole system apart we could potentially understand all the components, Dr. Klegg said, "but will that give us a complete picture of the flower's evolutionary future?" Probably not.
Because many of the unknowables are on the boundaries of each scientific discipline, scientists' ideas about unknowability have a lot to do with how optimistic those scientists are about bridging the gaps between different fields, in other words, how they feel about what the biologist E. O. Wilson calls consilience, the unity of knowledge.
In the current issue of "The Wilson Quarterly," Dr. Wilson declared that science is an interlocking system of fields. One day science will not only be able to give a complete picture of the flower's evolutionary prospects but will also be able to do the vastly more complex task of joining physics, chemistry and biology to the social sciences and humanities in one vast, unified web of knowledge. Ultimately, he suggests, there will be no boundary areas, no unknowables, between fields.
Responding to Dr. Wilson, the philosopher Richard Rorty argued that such a unified web of knowledge is not only unlikely but undesirable. Every one "of the various academic disciplines does its respective job," and their "vocabularies are irreducible to one another." What's more, "there can and should be thousands of ways of describing things and people," and there will always be boundaries, unknowables, at the edges of each discipline.
Others are willing to acknowledge boundaries but not unknowables. Michael Dummett, a philosopher at Oxford, said: "I don't actually believe one can identify something as absolutely unknowable. If a question makes clear sense, there's a possibility for an answer one way or another." The best one can do, he suggests, is hedge. Rather than talk about unknowables, why not just talk about the things that probably won't ever be known? You know?

HEADLINE: Raytheon Plans Deep Job Cuts And Closing Of 20 Plants

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 23

 BODY:
The Raytheon Company said today that it would cut 10 percent of its military-related work force, or about 8,700 people, in an effort to consolidate its operations after the recent acquisitions of Hughes Aircraft and the military businesses of Texas Instruments.
The job cutbacks -- more than half of which will be in California -- come as aerospace employment has in general leveled off after the steep decline of the early 1990's that resulted from the sharp reduction in Pentagon spending since the end of the cold war. 
 Raytheon also said that its engineering and construction division would cut 1,000 jobs, or about 6 percent. That business has slowed, in part because the financial turmoil in Asia has led to delays or cancellations in projects to build factories or infrastructure.
The company, based in Lexington, Mass., is expected to announce a charge against earnings of several hundred million dollars before taxes in connection with the cutbacks when it announces its latest quarterly results on Monday.
In addition to the job cutbacks, the military unit will shut 20 plants and parts of 6 others, reducing its total space by 20 percent.
Howard A. Rubel, aerospace analyst for Goldman, Sachs, said the size of the job reductions "catches your eye, but unfortunately I think we've become used to it."
Shares of Raytheon's class B shares fell 87.5 cents, to $50, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Raytheon completed the $9.5 billion acquisition of the defense division of Hughes Electronics, a subsidiary of General Motors, in December. Earlier in 1997 it purchased the defense operations of Texas Instruments for $2.95 billion.
The acquisitions made it one of the Big Three of the newly consolidated aerospace industry, behind Boeing and Lockheed Martin. The new Raytheon has revenues of about $20 billion on a pro-forma basis, with $14.5 billion of that in defense.
But the acquisitions have also raised Raytheon's debt by about $7 billion, to an estimated $10 billion. And it has created much duplication, particularly in missiles, where both Raytheon and Hughes were strong.
Raytheon now has 120,000 employees, with about 85,000 in defense. The cutbacks will be accomplished through layoffs beginning in February and attrition over two years.
"The actions we've taken today are really bold," William H. Swanson, the chairman and chief executive of Raytheon's defense business, told reporters, saying the moves would insure a healthier future. "If we've done it right we're preparing for growth, not contraction."
Over all, aerospace employment in the United States fell from more than 1.3 million in 1989 to fewer than 786,000 in 1995, according to the Aerospace Industries Association. But since then it has been growing a bit, though that is a result of strong demand for commercial aircraft, not weapons.
Raytheon's moves show the changing nature of the aerospace employment, from metal bending to more high-tech pursuits like electronics.
Most of the cutbacks will be in manufacturing or in administrative and support positions. But 2,700 engineers who will be freed from their existing jobs by the consolidation will be redeployed, and the company continues to recruit new technical employees.
"We are crying for software engineers," said Ken Dahlberg, president and chief operating officer of the Raytheon Systems Company, the defense unit.
The company's plan also reflects political considerations.
The company's home state of Massachusetts, for example, will see a reduction of only 300 administrative and general positions out of a total of more than 15,000 employees.
Raytheon spearheaded a drive that won state tax cuts for manufacturers in 1996. It would have created a political uproar had the company announced huge job reductions in Massachusetts only two years later.
The production of the Amraam -- standing for advanced medium-range air-to-air missile -- will be moved out of the Andover, Mass., factory and consolidated in a Tucson, Ariz., factory acquired with Hughes. But Andover will be left with the Patriot and Hawk missiles and will become one of two factories making circuit boards for the entire company.
California, meanwhile, where Hughes was based, will be hit the hardest, with 5,200 jobs lost, representing nearly one-third of Raytheon's employees here.
This will be a new blow to Southern California, where a decline in aerospace employment devastated the economy earlier this decade but where industry employment had leveled off in the last two years.
"We had taken one step forward and now we've taken three-quarters of a step back," said Jack Kyser, director of economic information for the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation. California has high costs but also has many engineers, some of whom might leave if asked to transfer elsewhere.
Raytheon said it would seek to concentrate manufacturing and design of key technologies. The two circuit board manufacturing plants, for example, will replace 19 locations making circuit boards for individual programs or units.

Steep Fall in Dollar Pulls Down Treasury Security Prices

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
A plunging dollar pulled bond prices sharply lower yesterday, sending the yield on the 30-year bond back near 6 percent. The dollar fell 1.5 percent against the German mark and 1.3 percent against the Japanese yen.
Just two weeks ago, the expectation of slower growth in the United States, the turmoil in Asia, the flight of foreign investors to American markets and low inflation had all combined to push the yield on the 30-year bond down to 5.69 percent, the lowest since the bond was first regularly issued in 1977. Other long-term yields also dropped to near 30-year lows, with the dollar rallying at the time. 
 But while the outlook for Indonesia is still very chancy, the outlook for other parts of Asia has improved, taking some pressure off the Japanese yen. Some investors seem to be counting on the promises of Japanese officials to offer a new economic program in February that will help the country's weakened banks and the economy. In addition, the outlook for South Korea seems to be improving.
These promises, traders said, have helped pull the value of the dollar down 4.8 percent against the yen in the last two weeks. The dollar has also dropped 2.4 percent against the German mark. And that, in turn, has led foreigners to sell the American currency and American securities to lock in profits before the dollar falls further and reduces their gains when they are translated back into their home currencies.
Some traders have also said that the dollar's downturn has been accelerated by accusations that President Clinton had a sexual affair with a young White House aide.
"I'm sure it didn't help," said Karen E. Parker, currency strategist at Chase Manhattan Bank. Traders on the floor, she said, "are talking about it all the time, so it must be having some impact."
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 114/32 , to 10212/32 , pushing up its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, to 5.96 percent -- a three-week high. On Thursday, the yield was 5.86 percent. The decline yesterday finished erasing all the gains made in the 1998 rally that peaked Jan. 12.
In late trading in New York, the dollar was at 1.7774 marks, down from 1.8045 marks Thursday, and 125.57 yen, down from 127.23.
The selloff of dollars and bonds may also reflect the fact that both markets had rallied so strongly in the first week and a half of the year. Often, such a strong rally is followed by a correction that can be set off by the smallest of excuses.
"People who were long the dollar were a bit too long," said Audrey McNiff, a vice president in foreign exchange sales at Goldman, Sachs & Company.
David Shabelman, Treasury market analyst for Standard & Poor's MMS, a market research and analysis firm in San Francisco, said: "The U.S. Government securities market has had a tremendous run-up in prices over the last few months because of the turmoil in the Asian financial markets.
"Now traders are trying to protect some of the profits they've made amid talk of the crisis in Washington. Adding to the urgency of the situation is talk of foreign-investor selling, all related to the dollar's decline, which, too, is related to Washington."
Barbara Kenworthy, portfolio manager at Prudential Mutual Funds, said that turmoil in the mortgage securities market might also be affecting the Treasury market. On Thursday, the Mortgage Bankers Association said that homeowners were applying to refinance their mortgages at a record pace, a situation that undermines the mortgage securities market.
In such circumstances, investors sell mortgage-backed securities and buy Treasury notes, usually 10-year notes, buying that probably helped the rally earlier this month. But she said there were signs that some investors who had rushed to make such trades may have reversed some of them yesterday because of the sharp fall in the bond market.
But she also said that the basic fundamentals supporting bonds were unchanged: inflation is expected to remain in check and the economic slowdown in Asia should curb growth in the United States.
Many investors, however, may have decided that they got a little ahead of the game because there are no significant signs yet that the economy is slowing. And that makes it more unlikely that the Federal Reserve, whose policy-making committee meets the first week of February, would consider any rate cut.
This change in attitude, plus the selling by foreign investors, is reflected in the fall in prices and rise in yields in shorter-term Treasury securities. For example, the yield on the two-year note jumped to 5.40 percent yesterday, from 5.30 Thursday and 5.02 on Jan. 12, the date of its recent intraday low.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Atmosphere of Uncertainty Leads to Continued Losses

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
After three years of spectacular returns, the stock market seems to have entered a period of uncertainty.
With corporate profits looking less robust these days, and the dollar and bond prices in at least a temporary descent, investors have become a little less optimistic about stocks. 
 As a result, the Dow Jones industrial average dropped another 30.14 points, to 7,700.74, yesterday, falling for the third consecutive session. For the week, the Dow lost 52.81 points, or seven-tenths of 1 percent.
 Broader indexes also slid. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 5.45, to 957.59, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell slightly, dropping 0.58 point, to 1,575.93, extending a string of losses this week.
On the Big Board, trading was heavy at more than 635 million shares, as nearly two stocks fell for every one that rose.
Wall Street strategists said the losses were insignificant but that the larger pattern in 1998 was negative. Among the concerns are weakening profits, a festering crisis in Asia and a White House scandal, exactly the kind of uncertainty that can disrupt optimism among investors.
"The market doesn't like uncertainty, and that's what we've had," said Arthur Hogan, a stock trader at Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover.
The events in Washington, however, were not front and center on Wall Street this week. The real concern has been the lackluster fourth-quarter earnings season.
"Earnings are not quite as good as they've been," said Hugh Johnson, an investment strategist at First Albany. "The market movers have been hurt. Not only have their fourth-quarter earnings been disappointing, but they've warned of more trouble in the first quarter."
Almost midway through the reporting season, corporate profits have come in just slightly ahead of the estimates put out by Wall Street analysts, estimates that had been sharply reduced in recent weeks.
But the profits, up about 9.2 percent from the period a year ago, were down sharply from 11 percent last quarter, according to First Call, which tracks earnings estimates. And that deceleration is expected to continue well into 1998.
"That 9 percent is not bad, but it's lower than what we've had in the last few quarters," said Charles Hill, research director at First Call. And more important, he said, are the revisions in first-quarter estimates..
"That number is dropping day by day," Mr. Hill added.
Among those warning of potential trouble in the first quarter were I.B.M., Intel, Microsoft, J. P. Morgan and Citicorp.
The great uncertainty is Asia. Economists and analysts have been trying to assess what kind of economic slowdown might be in store, but no consensus has developed.
Yet more and more strategists are warning investors to temper their expectations and be more careful about their stock selection. Although a broad array of stocks gained 20 percent last year, this year investors may not be so fortunate.
Byron R. Wien, the United States investment strategist at Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover, said that the market could gain sharply in the early part of the year but then fall sharply as the economy heats up.
"During the second half of the year, I expect traditional economic pressures to emerge," he said in a recent report. "By that time Asia should have begun to form a base, and the continuing U.S. expansion will result in rising wage pressures."
Instead of deflation and fierce price competition, which is a concern of many on Wall Street, Mr. Wien said that interest rates could begin to rise sharply near the end of the year, after it becomes clear that the American economy has not been harmed significantly by the crisis in Asia.
William L. Paternotte, an investment strategist at BT Alex. Brown, has a very different view. He said that he cannot imagine an outbreak of higher inflation anytime soon because corporations have little pricing power and Asia is weighing on the United States economy.
Yet, with the economy nearing full employment and wage pressures rising, there could be a counterbalance. "I can easily imagine a 1998 environment resembling a tug-of-war between the forces of deflation and reinflation," he said
In Tokyo, the Nikkei index of 225 issues rose 383.42 points, or 2.34 percent, to 16,789.11.

HEADLINE: Union Hopes to Organize Workers at Tribe's Casino

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ 

DATELINE: NEW LONDON, Conn., Jan. 23

 BODY:
In the last few days, billboards have sprung up here and in nearby towns warning of the "Foxwoods flu," a malady that has more to do with labor unrest than any virus.
The signs are an inkling of worker dissatisfaction at the nation's largest casino, Foxwoods Resort Casino, which is owned and operated by the Mashantucket Pequot Indians on their reservation in eastern Connecticut. 
 Just as Foxwoods capitalized on untapped gambling fever in New England, a major union is hoping to recruit the huge unorganized work force that the casino has spawned.
The Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees International Union started to post 10 billboards on Tuesday that say, "Foxwoods Flu: Has it happened to you?" and list a phone number at the bottom.
The billboards are part of an effort to reach the 12,000 workers at the casino in Ledyard in what could become an unprecedented organizing drive. Never before has a union been established at an Indian casino, where tribal sovereignty often takes precedence over state and Federal labor laws.
It is difficult to gauge how workers feel about conditions at the casino. A union survey last year reportedly showed widespread dissatisfaction, but tribal officials insist that workers are happy.
In six phone interviews, some workers complained of recent cutbacks, while others said they were thankful to have a job with comprehensive health benefits and a year-end bonus.
"They do whatever they please," said Norman Andersen, 43, an electrician who makes $17.97 an hour and says he would support a union. "They expect you to abide by their rules, but they change them every day."
Mr. Andersen and other workers said that the casino had cut back on bonuses, decreased the size of raises, ended its annual Christmas party, introduced co-payments on the company health plan and even tried to limit the amount that employees can eat at the employee cafeteria.
Another worker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, complained that the air quality in the casino was poor. When she saw a doctor because of a persistent cough, the first thing the physician asked was whether she worked at Foxwoods, she said. But she added that she felt lucky to have a job that paid for her to see a doctor and gave her any year-end bonus.
Mario Alvaran, 42, a blackjack dealer, said that he made $15 an hour, about $10 of it in tips, and that he felt lucky to have a job that paid that well.
Yet the billboards have clearly worried the tribe. Last week, before the ads were posted, Byron Quann, the tribe's chief communications officer, sent a letter to the union and local newspapers demanding that the union "stop this harmful public relations campaign." The letter expresses concern that the campaign will mislead employees and customers into believing that "Foxwoods operates its resort in an unsafe or unhealthy manner."
The casino has received calls from customers asking whether it is safe to gamble there because of the flu.
In his letter, Mr. Quann says that Foxwoods has a "computer-operated air quality control system" that insures that the air is healthy. Tribal officials have dismissed the idea that workers are dissatisfied.
"Foxwoods continually works to maintain an environment where its employees don't feel it is necessary to have a third party act as an intermediary," Jack Jones, the tribe's chief human resources officer, said in a statement released Thursday.
But the union has shown no signs of backing off. "The point of the billboards is to talk to current and former workers about conditions on the job," said Laura Moye, an organizer with the union, which began meeting with Foxwoods workers several years ago. "We want to hear about what's going on inside."
Ms. Moye said that the union did not know what was meant by the phrase "Foxwoods flu," but that it was mentioned by workers in a survey that the union commissioned last spring. That survey showed that workers were unhappy with conditions at the casino, The Hartford Courant has reported.
The 50,000-member union represents thousands of workers at Atlantic City and Las Vegas casinos, but an organizing drive at Foxwoods would face a different set of rules.
Nell Jessup Newton, a professor at the American University School of Law who specializes in Indian law, said the National Labor Relations Board ruled in 1976 that businesses operated by tribal governments are exempt from the Federal Labor Act. This means there would probably be no Federal protection of the union's efforts to organize at Foxwoods unless the board revisited the issue.
To organize the workers, the union would have to either apply economic pressure to Foxwoods or gain recognition under Pequot tribal law.
Although the tribe's law does not appear to have any specific rules regarding unions, it does not appear to bar them, said Jill Shibles, Chief Judge of the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Court. The tribal council could also pass laws spelling out a policy toward unions, she added.

Another Day, Another Indonesian Plunge

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 23

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund and the Clinton Administration worked today to complete a plan to prop up the rapidly deteriorating Indonesian banking system, diplomats and Government officials said.
Officials at the I.M.F. said they hoped to finish a plan by early next week under which the Indonesian Government would seize some ailing banks, provide them with new financing and then privatize them again, wiping out the holdings of existing shareholders in the process. 
 But it is unclear how much help the bank bailout would be in dealing with Indonesia's spreading problems. With the currency, the rupiah, plunging in value by the day, the financial system is starved for dollars that companies desperately need to repay loans, and some international banks have halted any new lending to creditors there. By some accounts the entire banking system is close to paralysis, raising the possibility of a cascade of defaults that could lead to widespread bankruptcies.
Bloomberg News reported from Jakarta today that Standard Chartered Bank, ABN-Amro Bank, Bank of America and Rabobank International are among banks no longer handling rupiah-denominated transactions in what is known as the interbank market, an international network that enables banks to lend each other money.
Officials from the United States and the I.M.F. pressed President Suharto last week to agree to a tough new package of economic changes intended to signal to bankers, investors and business executives that the nation would take whatever steps necessary to contain the turmoil.
But the financial markets have remained unconvinced, increasing the economic pressure on the country and raising fears about its social stability two months before President Suharto is expected to claim a seventh term in office after 32 years in power. There have already been instances of panic buying, and consumers face rapidly rising prices and the threat of surging unemployment in coming months.
In late trading in Asia the rupiah fell to 13,250 to the dollar, down from 12,000 a day earlier, when it had briefly traded as low as 16,500.
American officials were guarded in their comments, but gave no indication that the United States or other industrialized nations were preparing any big new financial bailouts for Indonesia, the world's fourth-most-populous country.
I.M.F. officials said Indonesia had $20 billion in foreign currency reserves, enough to keep the economy from collapsing in the short run though only a portion of the $65 billion in debts owed to foreign creditors by Indonesian companies.
There has been widespread speculation in the markets about a debt moratorium followed by an agreement between the banks and the companies on new terms for debt repayment. But there is little evidence any agreement is imminent.

Dollar Drop Roils Bonds, Sending Yields Up
The dollar declined abruptly in global foreign-exchange trading yesterday, pulling bond prices sharply lower and sending the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury surging toward 6 percent, only a few weeks after it had touched a record low of 5.69 percent. 
 Some traders attributed the dollar's drop to an improved outlook for much of Asia and political uncertainty created by President Clinton's preoccupation with a scandal over an alleged sexual affair. But others said the dollar and bonds were vulnerable to selloffs given their gains in recent weeks. Page D3.
 
Stocks fell for the third straight day in reaction to less-than-robust corporate earnings and the retreat in the dollar and bonds. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 30.14 points, to 7,700.74. For the week, the Dow lost 52.81 points, or seven-tenths of 1 percent. D3.

HEADLINE: Illusions of a War Against Cocaine

 BODY:
Panama is debating whether to let Washington keep American troops there to combat drug trafficking after the 1999 pullout date set by the canal treaties. The proposal, called the Multinational Counternarcotics Center, is one of several efforts to broaden the role of Latin American militaries in fighting drugs. It is dismaying to see Congress and the Clinton Administration return to a strategy that has failed and could harm Latin democracies.
Washington is seeking to keep more than 2,000 soldiers in Panama for 12 years to continue coordinating radar searches for suspicious aircraft, a job that could be done from American soil. The troops would also train Latin American military and police forces in drug-fighting. The project needs the approval of Panama's Congress and its voters in a referendum. Some American officials say the proposal is a way for Washington to maintain ties and coordination with Latin militaries now that cold-war rationales have evaporated. 
 Military aid and sales to Colombia have also been resumed, and this year Congress approved a five-year project costing up to $100 million to train and equip the Colombian and Peruvian militaries to interdict drugs transported by river. Washington has periodically pushed the Mexican military to take on an anti-drug role, and since 1996 has provided training, intelligence and equipment.
Some cooperation with Latin American law enforcement is useful. Crop substitution programs, which give coca-growing peasants economic incentives to switch crops, deserve expansion. But no one should put too much store in efforts to stop the production of cocaine in Latin America. Past efforts have not reduced the flow of drugs to the United States. A Rand Corporation study showed that source-country control was by far the least cost-effective way of reducing cocaine use. Treatment for addicts, it found, could have the same impact at a 20th of the price.
Even effective military operations show this strategy's limits. The Peruvian Air Force has stopped many planes carrying coca paste to Colombia for processing. But that success, along with a fungus that has attacked Peru's coca plants, has simply pushed coca-growing into Colombia.
Military strategies are not only ineffective, they can be harmful. The virus of corruption contaminates everyone who comes near the drug war, as the wave of recent arrests of Mexican officers shows. There is evidence from several countries that militaries have used their American equipment and training to fight guerrillas or to abuse human rights. The counternarcotics relationship has also led some Clinton Administration officials to praise officers and strengthen militaries that threaten civilian rule. These are echoes of cold-war abuses that the Administration should heed.

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT UNDER FIRE: THE DEFENDERS;
Clinton's Rapid-Response Squad Now Moves in Slow Motion

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 23

 BODY:
When Bill Clinton was running for President in 1992 and faced accusations of a 12-year extramarital affair with Gennifer Flowers, his aides corralled reporters to declare that Ms. Flowers was lying and had been paid by trashy tabloids.
His loyalists evolved into a legendary "rapid response" team to advance Mr. Clinton's case with each tick of the news cycle. The team has since been widely emulated but its effectiveness rarely equaled. 
 Now, with Mr. Clinton facing the biggest personal crisis of his Presidency, the old team is on the sidelines. Many of them have left Mr. Clinton's employ.
With the President's lawyers in control, hardly any other Democrats have stepped into the breach. Even Vice President Al Gore has commented on the situation only in a meeting in his office with a handful of newspaper columnists -- and no television cameras.
Oddly, some of the rapid-response team seem to be making things worse for their old boss..
George Stephanopoulos, a main campaign aide in 1992 and Mr. Clinton's senior adviser until after the 1996 election, was among the first to use the word "impeachment" over the allegations that Mr. Clinton was sexually involved with a 21-year-old intern and conspired to have her lie about it. Mr. Stephanopoulos now is a political analyst for ABC News.
Dee Dee Myers, Mr. Clinton's former press secretary and now an editor at Vanity Fair, said on NBC's "Today" show, "If he's not telling the truth, I think the consequences will be astronomical."
After five years of Washington political battles, the President has alienated many in his own party, particularly in Congress. And he has sent enough signals over the years so that some people find the charges against him at least plausible.
Jim Ruvolo, the former Democratic chairman in Ohio and now a political consultant, said people are outlining two scenarios: "If it's untrue, it's outrageous he has to put up with these charges, that this only gets worse and why would any good person get into this business? Others say if it's true, it's the death knell of his Presidency."
Geraldine Ferraro, the 1984 Democratic Vice-Presidential nominee and now a candidate for the Senate from New York, first told a New York One television interviewer that she thought the allegations, if true, constituted an impeachable offense.
"If indeed someone urges someone to perjure themselves, then absolutely, absolutely," Mrs. Ferraro said.
Representative Henry A. Waxman, a California Democrat and longtime Clinton supporter, spoke to reporters in a break in a hearing on Capitol Hill, saying, "If it's true, I think the President is in deep trouble."
In New Hampshire, Amanda Merrill, a Democrat and deputy minority leader in the state House, said: "We're not happy about it." She added: "This is not the sort of thing to have eating up people's time."
To be sure, there have been some gestures of support.
Mr. Gore gave a measured statement. "The President has denied the charges, and I believe it," he said.
And today, Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, which would conduct any impeachment hearings, volunteered a statement. Without defending the President, he questioned the evidence against him, saying the tapes could have been illegally recorded and might not be admissible as evidence.
Reporters for MSNBC caught up with Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of Manhattan, today in Cuba. Rather than insist on the President's innocence, Mr. Rangel attacked the credibility of Kenneth W. Starr, the independent counsel investigating the charges. But, he added: "If indeed the President was guilty of obstruction of justice, I really would think that the word 'impeachment' would be one of the words to be used."
One measure of the lack of big guns to defend the President was the appearance on CNN today of a relatively unknown Democratic consultant, Jennifer Laszlo, as the counterpoint to Frank Luntz, a prominent Republican consultant and pollster. As Ms. Laszlo tried to change the subject to the healthy economy, Mr. Luntz gave her a backhanded compliment. "They're having a tough time in having the Democrats come forward," he said, "and there aren't many Democrats as loyal as you."
But Mr. Luntz himself had sent a memo to all Republican members of Congress telling them to keep mum on the subject. "The facts will speak far louder than any of your voices," he wrote. "If you comment, you will take a non-partisan, non-political situation and make it both partisan and political.
"Do not speculate. Do not hypothesize. Too many Americans justify the President's behavior because they dislike his accusers. Please don't add to that justification."
Charter members of Mr. Clinton's rapid-response team have been subdued in their limited appearances on television.
James Carville was perhaps the most vociferous of Mr. Clinton's defenders, screaming at reporters in 1992 for even bringing up Ms. Flowers and, as recently as Sunday, going on "Meet The Press" as part of his long campaign to discredit Paula Corbin Jones, who has accused Mr. Clinton of making crude sexual advances toward her.
This week Mr. Carville said on "Larry King Live" that the drill could get wearying.
"Having gone through the same thing any number of times, particularly during the campaign, they're more tired that anything," he said of White House aides. "Tired in terms of just dealing with it."
Another member of the rapid-response team was Mandy Grunwald, a media adviser in 1992 who made her name by aggressively challenging the legitimacy of Ted Koppel's "Nightline" report on Ms. Flowers.
But on "Larry King Live" Ms. Grunwald was more cautious Thursday night: "This is one of the really hard times when the best P.R. advice is not always the best legal advice."

HEADLINE: Consumers Play Role In Depleted Fish Stocks

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"Senseless Killing in the Seas" (editorial, Jan. 20) is right that "America's fisheries are not in good shape," but the fishing industry and its methods deserve only a small portion of the blame. As we continue to fill wetlands, empty sewer overflows in estuaries and dump garbage in the ocean, we damage the ecosystem that feeds the fishery. Because of acid rain and the greenhouse effect, water temperatures have increased in fishing areas. 
 Consumers must take some responsibility, too. We have demanded white flaky fish, like cod and flounder, known as groundfish. Fifty years ago, groundfish significantly outnumbered their predators. Now the opposite is true.
Fishermen could help by catching more "underutilized" fish like mackerel and dogfish. In Gloucester, Mass., where I was economic development coordinator from 1993 to 1995, diversification has been slow to take effect because these fish are not desired by consumers. It's time we stop blaming the fisherman for a global problem.

HEADLINE: Mayor's Shopping Mission: Tax Free or Bust;
Trumpeting Cause to Lift Levy (and Picking Up Socks Along the Way)

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY 

 BODY:
A few days ago, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani found himself in a setting of Felliniesque design: surrounded by four sets of identically dressed identical twins, while a Giuliani impersonator belted out the lyrics to "New York, New York."
Perhaps only a late-night bowl of chili could conjure such a dreamlike scene. But this was all too real, coming as part of the Mayor's efforts to promote a weeklong suspension of the sales tax on clothing purchases under $500 in New York City stores. 
 The tax break ended at midnight last night, leaving mayoral aides to ponder whether it was enough to persuade state legislators to eliminate the clothing tax altogether, which in the city amounts to 8.25 percent. But there was no uncertainty over Mr. Giuliani's commitment to the cause, as he cut a swath through overstuffed clothes racks and perfume counters from Staten Island to the Bronx.
His critics might argue that the issue is hardly a political risk. Brave are the few who are for taxes. But those critics might take comfort in knowing that the Mayor still had to earn his good press, as evidenced the other day when he was ensconced in twins, smiling gamely, waiting for photographs to be snapped.
The issue is important to Mr. Giuliani, who maintains that eliminating the clothing sales tax would keep city consumers from straying to New Jersey, where there is no sales tax on clothes. He also says it would create as many as 20,000 jobs, a priority on the mayoral agenda.
The Mayor's aides say that the early returns in this week's promotion show there was a 50 percent jump in the sale of clothes and shoes, in a month when consumers, shellshocked from holiday shopping battles, tend not to spend. Those figures, slightly lower than those from a similar promotion last January, are generated from a daily survey of 150 stores citywide.
Mr. Giuliani's yearslong campaign has met with some success. Beginning in December 1999, a new state law will allow the city to eliminate taxes on clothes under $100. But Charles Millard, the Mayor's senior economic adviser, said that Mr. Giuliani's mission this week was "total elimination" of clothing taxes, a goal too ambitious even for Sheldon Silver, the Assembly Speaker, who has been fighting for a tax break of up to $500.
The Mayor's plan is not universally embraced by economists. "The decision to do this is powered by political ambition," said Bennett Harrison, an urban economist at the New School, "not by any systematic analysis that proves you'll change people's decisions on where to shop."
But the Mayor, emboldened by his staff's own economic research, disagrees, and is on a mission to prove the doubters wrong. For the last week, his voice, name and image have appeared in $400,000 worth of newspaper and radio advertisements promoting the campaign. And he himself set out to shop.
Two days before the "sales tax-free week" formally began, Mr. Giuliani left City Hall and walked across Chambers Street to Modell's Sporting Goods store, where a lectern bearing the city seal and placed amid racks of sweatshirts suggested that his visit was expected. Also in the store were four sets of adult identical twins and a Giuliani lookalike, all hired to promote the store's offer to clone its January tax discount in February.
After trumpeting the virtues of tax-free shopping, the Mayor tried to assume the role of the everyday shopper, albeit one being followed by a swarm of bodyguards and photographers. He rubbed the fabric of a Knicks warmup jacket between his fingers, he admired some baseball jerseys, and he bantered:
"I'm a traditionalist. I like old uniforms." "You don't have the new Mets stuff yet?" "Super Bowl hats? That's a strange-looking hat."
Then an aide said, "The twins are set up." The Mayor posed for photographs, then he completed his purchase at Modell's: the Knicks jacket, a New York Yankees shirt, a St. John's University basketball jersey and two Green Bay Packers shirts. He spent $71.46, and he saved about $6.50 in taxes.
He had only begun to shop.
Last Saturday, he bought three pairs of socks, two sweatshirts and a red sweater at an Old Navy store in the Bronx. But he had already wandered the aisles of a Caldor nearby, he admitted. "I'm not going to tell you what I bought because it's a little embarrassing. Some socks and a few other things, personal things."
A City Hall source said the Mayor had purchased underwear.
On Sunday, Mr. Giuliani led guards and reporters through another Caldor, this one on Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn. Again, he headed to a display of socks. Holding up a pair decorated with small hearts, he asked a bodyguard, "A Valentine's Day gift for Randy Mastro?" in a joking reference to his trusted Deputy Mayor of Operations.
On Wednesday, the Mayor made one more venture into the world of consumerism, this time to the Staten Island Mall, where he was accompanied by the Borough President, Guy V. Molinari. They strolled past the Body Shop, Banana Republic, Bun 'n' Burger.
But shopping has a way of numbing the soul; even the most zealous of missionaries need a break. On this day, his last in promoting the tax-free week, Mr. Giuliani politely declined the offer of a makeover from a Sears beauty adviser. And he resisted the urge to buy socks.

HEADLINE: SUPER BOWL XXXII;
It's Crazy, Lavish and Excessive, but Not Spontaneous

BYLINE: By BILL PENNINGTON

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO, Jan. 23

 BODY:
There was a two-page news release to announce the color, shape and design of the approximately two million pieces of confetti that will be shot from cannons at the end of Sunday's football game between the Green Bay Packers and the Denver Broncos.
There was a news conference to discuss the flipping of the pre-game coin. Another one to explain the singing of the national anthem. Another to announce that the 10,000 balloons to be released during the pre-game show are biodegradable. The Stealth bomber pilots doing the flyover at kickoff were made available. So was the pilot of the blimp. 
 A color psychologist was on hand to interpret the strengths and weaknesses portrayed within the teams' uniform designs.
And there was a large, well-attended reception to celebrate the Bud Bowl, the annual pretend playing of a game between two teams of beer bottles.
The buildup to the Super Bowl, the season-ending championship of the National Football League and a cultural winter landmark, has been called scripted insanity.
From mass interviews with the news media -- where 320-pound players are asked, "If you were a tree, what kind of tree would you be?" -- to parties for reporters at Sea World -- where the whales have been trained to mimic football moves -- the week preceding the Super Bowl is an annual testimony to simulated spontaneity.
The drumbeat that drives the week is a kind of choreographed excess.
"I was told the scene and all the planning at the Super Bowl was beyond anything else I had seen," said Smokey Robinson, the Motown singer and songwriter who will be a featured performer in the halftime show. "Now that I'm here, my impression is that they were right. This is a crazy week, man."
The headline in The San Diego Union-Tribune last Sunday read: S.D. Has S.B. Fever.
The next day, there was another headline across the newspaper's front page, shouting from newsstand boxes on street corners throughout the city: Is L.A. Envious?
By the time Super Bowl XXXII starts on Sunday at 6:18 P.M. Eastern time, 80,000 visitors will have descended upon San Diego. Previous Super Bowl host cities have estimated the economic windfall to be at least $100 million. The event is a source of pride, and every year, regardless of the city, the Super Bowl host committee is swamped with volunteers who just want to get close to the action.
What the volunteers see is a numbing procession of news conferences and shuttle-bus rides to and from the hotels that house the teams, monotonous rehearsals for Super Bowl celebrations and punctilious preparations to make the event efficient.
The fun stuff is out of bounds. The team practices are closed. At the hotels where the teams stay, the players are sequestered from the public, usually walking through separate corridors that are roped off to keep other guests of the hotel, or fans arriving to be a part of the scene, at a distance.
In fact, local residents wanting to feel a part of the Super Bowl festivities might be better off in the streets, away from the official league functions.
There have been special Super Bowl street parties, road-running races, golf tournaments, craft-making carnivals and harbor cruises, most of them unofficial.
The N.F.L. has found one runaway winner, the N.F.L. Experience, a football theme park that appeals to children and adults. It is a popular attraction drawing thousands across three days. Thursday's lines were 90 minutes long for one field-goal attempt.
But then, crowds are the backdrop to every facet of the event.
Tuesday, at the site of the game, Qualcomm Stadium, the league conducted its annual interview session. Thousands of members of the news media were herded like cattle through the gates.
Once inside, after the players were positioned at podiums and key locations in the grandstand, it was as if someone had fired a gun to begin a race. Reporters scurried, and the giant stadium clock at the far end of the facility began a countdown signaling how many minutes remained in the session, the numerals ticking off like a game in overtime.
Two minutes to go! Can you find one more lineman who can explain what victory will mean to him?
Similar packed interview sessions are repeated for three successive days. In the end, it is hard to know who is more fed up with whom. Are the players more tired of talking with the reporters, or vice versa?
Thursday, Packers defensive end Reggie White wore a T-shirt with one word on the front: why?
No one ventured an answer. It was hard enough to come up with a remotely original question.
Some of the more talkative players, like Green Bay safety Eugene Robinson, enjoyed holding the news media hostage.
"I was telling some friends just last night that I get to talk all I want and these poor guys have to listen to me," Robinson said. "Because you all got to write something. You have to listen to me whether you like it or not."
The N.F.L. schedules the interviews with the players and coaches each morning, feeds the reporters lunch, then whisks them off in a caravan of buses to the sprawling news media center downtown, where it deposits them content in the knowledge that the voracious god of Super Bowl hype will be nourished once again by nightfall.
Nothing at the Super Bowl, it seems, is left to chance, even the most chancy affair of all, the frenetic 10-minute halftime show.
Wednesday, beneath the Mission Valley Freeway, the performers in the halftime show -- 1,200 strong -- marched in a parking lot outside Qualcomm Stadium.
The outline of a simulated football field had been painted in the parking lot, with hash marks and yard markers, the rectangle illuminated by large, bright spotlights on a chilly evening four days before the game.
On command, with military-like precision, the cheerleaders, dancers and volunteers assembled from 47 California high schools and colleges paraded onto the fake field, finding coded locations that designated assigned places.
"Mark your spot," one of the show's directors shouted through a bullhorn. "Stay between the lines."
The show is a dizzying production that will include 20 Motown stars on a 32-ton portable stage, more than 5,000 props, 2,500 pyrotechnic explosions and as many stage cues as there are in the 90 minutes of Radio City Music Hall's Christmas extravaganza.
The Super Bowl halftime show is a tribute to some maniacally detailed choreography. And there is no small amount of symbolism that it will be performed right in the middle of the most choreographed sporting event.
"It's amazing, all the reporters, all the workers, all the volunteers, all the people," Smokey Robinson said, smiling and shaking his head as he waited in the parking lot outside the stadium for the rehearsal to wrap up. "What a spectacle. Look at us, we've got a thousand people and we're cramming them into a 10-minute show. Ten minutes, can you imagine that? The preparation is intense. Everything laid out to the last second.
"I look around and I just say, 'Thank God I'm not the choreographer.' "

HEADLINE: Chrysler Net Up But Higher Costs Raise Concerns

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 23

 BODY:
The Chrysler Corporation reported fourth-quarter earnings today that were better than expected, but the numbers, particularly a sharp increase in rebates and other incentives, set Wall Street to worrying about the auto industry's prospects for this year.
The cost of rebates and other incentives by Chrysler jumped 79.5 percent in the quarter, alarming analysts who expect other auto makers will also show increases in marketing costs. 
 Analysts are also concerned that Chrysler and the other Detroit giants -- the General Motors Corporation and the Ford Motor Company -- face a stagnant domestic market with falling prices and falling demand.
"When you have an industry that's flat and you've got excess capacity and everyone fighting for market share, it's going to be tough," said Wendy Beale Needham, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
Chrysler shares fell 68.75 cents today, or 2 percent, to $33.50, amid an overall decline in the shares of auto makers.
"Chrysler's results could be a harbinger of tough things to come" for Detroit, said Jack V. Kirnan, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney. For Chrysler and the others, "1998 we think has to be considered a riskier year than 1997," he said.
Chrysler said it earned $852 million, or $1.28 a fully diluted share, in the fourth quarter, up 5.6 percent from $807 million, or $1.12 a share, in the corresponding quarter a year earlier. Excluding a one-time gain from the initial public offering of the Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group, Chrysler earned $792 million, or $1.19 a share, down 27.3 percent from the $1.09 billion, or $1.51 a share, a year ago, also including special items.
Despite the fall in Chrysler's operating earnings, last year was a boom year for Detroit. G.M. is scheduled to release earnings Monday, while Ford's report is expected Tuesday.
The Big Three are expected to post combined 1997 profits of about $15.1 billion, well up from the 1994 record of $13.9 billion in combined earnings, with much of the profit coming from sales of high-margin sport utility vehicles and other trucks. Chrysler's earnings for the year were $2.81 billion, or $4.09 a share, down 20.5 percent from 1996. G.M. is expected to earn about $5.9 billion, or $7.84 a share, according to the consensus of analysts' estimates by First Call, a research firm. Ford is expected to earn $6.7 billion, or $5.41 a share, largely because its large sport utility vehicles have proved so popular.
While Chrysler's earnings held up fairly well last year and earnings this year are expected to come close to the record 1996 level, analysts said the company appeared to be near the top of its performance.
"Chrysler to a large extent is a victim of its own success," Mr. Kirnan of Salomon said. Because Chrysler has done so well in the last few years, "the question now is how much worse can things get."
The economic downturn in Asia crimped Chrysler's sales, but had little material effect on fourth-quarter earnings, said Robert J. Eaton, Chrysler's chairman and chief executive. Chrysler has less exposure to Asia.than G.M. or Ford.
Mr. Eaton added that Chrysler, like General Motors and Ford, would consider taking advantage of the lower costs in dollar terms by expanding Asian operations. "If the right opportunity presents itself, we'll be there, " he said.
 Mr. Eaton also strongly defended sport utility vehicles against recent criticisms that the four-wheel-drive vehicles pose serious dangers for people in cars when there are collisions. Mr. Eaton noted that when small cars were introduced in the 1970's, some safety experts predicted that highway death rates would rise from collisions of the small cars with the much bigger, older cars that were built in the 1960's.
"You know what happened?" Mr. Eaton asked. "Deaths per 100 million miles, deaths per vehicle, deaths per mile, no matter what you look at, it didn't happen, it continued to drop. And believe me, that's exactly what I think will happen going forward."
But Donald W. Reinfurt, the deputy director of the Highway Safety Research Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said the comparison with the 1970's was flawed. The spread of small cars coincided with a reduction in the national speed limit to 55 miles an hour, rising use of seat belts, a decline in drunken driving and stricter Federal safety standards for autos, he said.
There are few comparably big gains to be made now in automotive safety, while the mismatches in weight between cars and today's big sport utility vehicles are even larger than the mismatches between large and small cars in the 1970's, Mr. Reinfurt added.

HEADLINE: Sailing the High-End Seas;
Luxury Craft Are Back and Prices Are Bigger Than Ever

BYLINE: By JIM CARRIER 

DATELINE: FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., Jan. 20

 BODY:
Susan Puleo, an interior architect, mixes glass spiral staircases, leather floors, fiber optics and African rosewood to set off antiques in clients' salons. The stairs, entwining cockatoo cages, lead to master bedrooms with fireplaces and waterfront views, dance floors with smoke machines, hot tubs with wet bars, even to basketball courts that fold away when not in use.
Her creations also speed along at 20 knots, burn 400 gallons of fuel an hour, turn 1,200 gallons of sea water into fresh each day and spend the summer in the Mediterranean. 
 A new gilded age of yachting is dawning.
Five years after Congress repealed a 10 percent luxury tax on new boats costing more than $100,000 that had contributed to a plunge in sales, the boating industry is rebounding vigorously. Led by an appetite among the newly rich for extravagant boats -- costing $3 million to $30 million -- new yacht sales, both motor and sail, last year roughly matched the record $2 billion in purchases reached in 1988. While still much lower in inflation-adjusted dollars, the total today reflects a smaller number of much more expensive boats.
The boating revival is a visible measure of the wealth created by the stock market boom and yet another example of the widening gap between the rich and everybody else.
Sales of inboard cruisers, which are generally at least 35 feet in length, jumped 38 percent last year to $1.7 billion. Sales of sailboats over 35 feet long rose 40 percent, to $350 million.
For almost a decade, the boat industry was dead, leading to the closing and consolidation of several companies and a drop in employment from 600,000 to 400,000 jobs. Even today, with employment back up to about 650,000, sales of smaller motor yachts, 35 to 50 feet, have only partly recovered.
Whether the two-year luxury tax can be blamed for more than an worsening role still is debated. Signed by President George Bush along with a tax on expensive cars that was included in a deficit reduction bill, the luxury-boat tax went into effect in 1991. After an immense cry from marine communities, and little to show in higher tax revenues, the tax on boats was repealed in August 1993, retroactive to January.
The National Marine Manufacturers Association, representing inboard motor cruisers, argues that sales would be nearly double today if the tax had never been enacted.
But boating began to drop two years before the tax went into effect and remained battered by fallout from the 1987 stock market crash, the 1990-91 Persian Gulf war recession and the shock, however brief, of high interest rates and high oil prices. And for a while, the ostentation of the mid-1980's was passe.
Boating, once the favorite pastime of successful car dealers, lost allure -- plagued by high costs, poor quality and competition from golf and other leisure-time activities such as watching movies on elaborate home entertainment centers.
Shaken manufacturers, borrowing hard lessons from the auto industry, are only now beginning to stress better service, innovative financing and factory efficiency.
"We did blame the luxury tax," said Frank F. Herhold, executive director of the Marine Industries Association of South Florida. "But while many in the industry slept, our market share slipped away."
That was then. But now, here in America's Venice, with canals chock-a-block with 17,000 boats, dozens of brokers and a small army of marine craftsmen, the recession seems a distant memory. All boats appear to be rising with the tide of the stock market and the affluence of a maturing baby-boom generation. But as in Orwell's "Animal Farm," the biggest and most expensive are rising faster than others.
"It's on a real good upswing," said David Gennett, a sales executive with Allied Marine Group here. Florida leads the nation in marine expenditures at $3.4 billion last year.
Nationally, there is a backlog of factory orders, extending demand to used boats that sell for close to their original price.
"Since August we have taken in $90 million in net sales, as much as I took in in all of '96," said Bryant Phillips, senior vice president for sales and marketing of Hatteras Yachts in New Bern, N.C., which dominates the 39- to 70-foot motor yacht market. "It reminds us of the salad days of the late 80's."
Hatteras revenues fell in half the year after the tax was enacted. It cut 1,000 jobs from a work force of 1,800. Even with the closing of one of its two factories this winter to improve efficiency, the company has restored about 200 of the lost jobs. The growth at Hatteras now is in boats more than 50 feet, a trend evident throughout the industry.
At Broward Marine in Fort Lauderdale, six aluminum motor yachts -- stretching from 88 to 107 feet and selling from $5 million to $15 million -- are in various stages of construction. B. David Wiest, the controller, says the owners "are not too worried about the economy," adding, "They all pay cash."
"This will be a country kitchen," he said, ducking through a rough-cut door on an informal tour. "The entertainment center will be here. Watch your head. There may be a jet ski or two there." Broward's boats are considered starter mega-yachts.
"The top end of the market is just booming," said Mike Kelsey, chairman of Palmer Johnson, which employs 300 people in Sturgeon Bay, Wis., building six mega-yachts a year.
When the Robb Report, a catalogue of conspicuous consumption, called Mr. Kelsey for a contribution to its Christmas issue, he offered to showcase a 200-foot, $32 million motor yacht now under construction.
"I've gotten nine inquiries," Mr. Kelsey said. "It shows you sticker shock didn't deter them."
At the Fort Lauderdale boat show in November more than 20 boats, each costing $18 million to $20 million, sold in five days, according to Kaye Pearson, president of the show.
"You wouldn't think there would be impulse buys in that range, but there are," Mr. Pearson said.
Today, about 5,000 pleasure boats larger than 100 feet exist, double the number of a decade ago, said Jim Gilbert, who edits Showboats International magazine. Every year for the last three, 200 boats -- six miles of yachts -- have been under construction in boat yards around the world.
Nearly half of the orders are from Americans. Most come from the growing clan of self-made multimillionaires, flush from an public offering, a buyout or stock options, who have reached a financial zenith and want to repair to the ocean in safety and comfort.
Take Jim Mattei, 48, an investor and a builder of condominiums and shopping centers. "It's really the only passion I have," Mr. Mattei said in a telephone interview from his home in Charlotte, N.C. "I don't mind working 8 or 10 hours on the boat."
Like most owners of large yachts, Mr. Mattei moved up, from a 57-foot Chris Craft to a 90-footer to his present 120-foot Emerald K. He's building a 150-foot boat, which will also have satellite phones, three tenders, a crew of six and an art collection.
Why a bigger boat?
Family. "We look like Noah's ark when we arrive, my mother, who is 80, my son and all his friends," Mr. Mattei said. "We have five staterooms, and we were always full. It's nothing about egocentric rich guys with big toys. It's completely changed from the 80's."
Yes, the boats have become even more immense, with richer interiors, bigger engines and more water toys.
When a mega-yacht pulls into Fort Lauderdale, it's as if a tiny nation washed up, in terms of economic impact. If it docks at Pier 66, for example, the tie-up, complete with phone and room service, costs $450 a night, or $13,500 a month. Fuel can run several thousand dollars. And the marina could take in more big boats if it had the space.
"The business we turn away are the 120-footers." said James R. Allmand 3d, general manager of the Hyatt Regency Pier 66. "It gets frustrating."
A 150-foot motor craft can cost $1.5 million to run and maintain a year, said Bob Saxon, who manages 80 yachts for owners, chartering many to help defray expenses that typically include $500,000 for crew, $200,000 for fuel, $100,000 in insurance, $65,000 for food and liquor, and $225,000 for hauling the boat out of the water and normal repairs. A bottom paint job every four years costs $400,000.
When a large boat comes in, it is swarmed over by woodworkers, mechanics, electricians, carpet layers, you name it.
"I was on one that had 18 men working on it, all making $25 to $50 an hour," said Thomas J. Murray, an economist with the University of South Florida. "One boat can mean 50 jobs. So if 500 boats need refitting you're talking hundreds of millions expended."
Most large-boat owners register them offshore, usually in the Bahamas and the Cayman Islands, a practice that thrived during the luxury-tax years. By closing the deal in Nassau, they avoided not only the Federal tax, but also state sales tax.
Today, a $7,000 incorporation on a $5 million boat saves $525,000. Sailing under a foreign flag, they can also hire foreign crews and enter nations like Cuba. To enter American waters they need an annual cruising permit.
Whatever the cause of the downturn in the late 1980's and early 1990's, all involved now agree that the recession shook up an industry that had taken success for granted. Affluent consumers now rank boats No. 15 on their wish lists, down from No. 6 in 1984. Big screen television sets and home computers rank higher for this crucial group of would-be beginners who could become future yacht owners.
After a series of introspective studies the marine industry is considering certification of dealers to insure quality products and repairs, warranties on used boats and a self-imposed surcharge on sales to finance a national ad campaign.
Time sharing is also being tried, so people with incomes of, say, $200,000 a year can own a piece of an 80-foot yacht for $70,000 down, said Guy E. Veni, executive vice president of the sales financing division of CIT, a $1 billion underwriter of boat loans.
Still looming over the industry are environmental crackdowns on engine pollution and raw sewage discharge. "You can make it bigger, but I'm not seeing a lot of intelligence," said Ms. Puleo, the designer. "I'd like to hear about their nonpolluting systems."
Most owners spend a few weeks on their yachts and usually sell them in two years. At that rate, Capt. Michael Auer figures, a typical owner spends $2,000 for each hour of actual boat time.
The boat he runs, named Adler, is owned by a European businessman. It burns 500 gallons of diesel fuel an hour at top speed, at a cost of 72 cents a second.
But Adler does not cross the Atlantic on its own. The owner prefers to load the yacht into a huge open tanker to be carried to the Mediterranean, avoiding wear and tear on the engine and fittings. The cost? $225,000 round trip.
"I'd never own a boat," said Captain Auer said. "I know better."

Charts: "S.S. Big Spenders"
After a steep drop in sales in the early 90's, luxury boats are reviving, particularly the biggest ones. These so-called mega-yachts are not for the faint of heart, as their upkeep can dent even big pocketbooks.

SONG FOR THE
 BLUE OCEAN
 Encounters Along the World's Coasts and Beneath the Seas.
 By Carl Safina.
 458 pp. New York:
 Henry Holt & Company. $30. 
 Can you imagine trying to impress friends and business associates by ordering, say, breast of eagle in tarragon sauce, or tournedos of panda? But you would probably have no second thoughts about serving a platter of glistening bluefin tuna sashimi, and it is precisely this unwillingness to extend the sense of community to living things below the high-tide line that Carl Safina believes is the main reason some species of fish are threatened with extinction.
In "Song for the Blue Ocean," his engrossing and illuminating journey to the world's marine killing grounds stirs up typhoon-sized waves of bad news for almost anyone fond of eating, catching or admiring fish, including sushi lovers, backyard swordfish barbecuers, sport fishermen hoping for more than sunburn and a beer hangover from a day's charter, scuba divers lacking the time or money to search out reefs that dynamite and cyanide have not yet turned into underwater Hiroshimas, independent commercial fishermen and travelers expecting fishing boats and fishermen in coastal villages instead of boutiques.
Everywhere Safina goes he finds declining catches and threatened species. On the Eastern Seaboard of the United States, only eight yellowtail flounder out of 100 survive from one year to the next, and 40 miles of line and more than 1,000 hooks are required to catch what one man with a harpoon could land, within sight of land, in the 1960's. The legendary Grand Banks fisheries have become so barren that Newfoundland's unemployment rate is an astonishing 60 percent, and its yearly welfare budget stands at $2 billion. The bluefin tuna breeding population has fallen nearly 90 percent in 15 years, scientific reports put stocks of marlin and swordfish at their lowest levels in history, and 9 out of 10 swordfish harvested are juveniles who have never spawned. The charter fishing fleet of one Oregon town has shrunk from 300 to 20 in just five years, and the number of active salmon trolling licenses in Washington fallen from 2,300 to 600 in the last 20. Recreational salmon fishing has been closed between San Francisco and the Canadian border, and the Alaska halibut season is now reduced to 24 hours a year.
Some of these horror stories have been reported in environmental publications and the mainstream news media, but Safina, a research ecologist who founded the Living Oceans Program of the National Audubon Society, is the first to knit them together into a single passionate and enthralling narrative. This is not one of those environmental screeds that marshal the usual depressing statistics, excoriate the predictable villains and despair for the future. Instead, Safina takes us on a tour, not just to the most imperiled fishing grounds on earth, but also to Washington hearing rooms, pricey Asian restaurants, impoverished coastal villages and inland spawning grounds. He goes out with a Maine charter captain who compares the 1,000 trophy-sized fish he landed in previous years with the 60 he hopes to catch now. He flies over New England fishing grounds with a professional fish spotter who guides commercial fishermen to the giant tuna that command astronomical prices from the fish-mad Japanese. In Washington State, he joins a commercial fisherman who landed 400 fish in a single day in 1985 but is now lucky to catch four. This man is so heartbreakingly optimistic that he justifies his pointless fishing trips by arguing that although he's going broke, at least he's helping the community by buying fuel and paying dockage. On the Pacific island of Palau, where overfishing with dynamite has damaged reefs, he goes diving to tag fish for a census conducted by the Department of Natural Resources. In the Philippines he watches members of the Cyanide Reform Program attempt to persuade villagers to catch fish for aquariums without using reef-poisoning sodium cyanide. And, finally, in Hong Kong, he attends a lavish banquet where two-thirds of the seafood harvested at such cost is returned to the kitchen uneaten.
The villains include venal politicians and the timid government bureaucrats charged with setting and enforcing fishery regulations, timber companies whose irresponsible forestry practices are turning wild salmon into the bison of the Pacific Northwest, and greedy commercial fishermen whose giant nets and long lines cause such havoc among breeding populations. He is particularly scathing about the founder of the East Coast Tuna Association, who claims credit for first shipping bluefin to Japan, refuses to consider the mounting evidence it is endangered and, according to Safina, is "solemnly dedicated to making a dollar." Equally sharply criticized are the Army Corps of Engineers for closing a dam on the Columbia River before the fish ladders were ready so that it could be dedicated on schedule (causing 200,000 adult salmon to hurl themselves to death against its concrete), and Hong Kong glitterati who routinely pay hundreds of dollars for a prized and rare reef fish so they can announce, according to one of Safina's Chinese acquaintances, "I'm a very rich person, an affluent person."
One of the aspects of his story Safina finds most shocking is how much overfishing is prompted by considerations of status, and superstition. Sharks are killed in record numbers because their $200-per-pound dorsal fins add a questionable potency to herbal medicines and a still more questionable flavor to expensive soups. The Napoleon wrasse is taken live from Philippine reefs so businessmen can impress clients by ordering $250 platters of their lips. The bluefin is endangered because it is worth more than any large creature on earth -- more even than an elephant or a rhinoceros -- and worth its price to status-conscious Japanese executives. (But anyone tempted to conclude from this that contributing to ecological disasters for frivolous notions of status is confined to Asia might consider the upper-middle-class American families accomplishing their rounds of suburban errands in those greenhouse-gas-belching sport utility vehicles.)
Safina makes no attempt to disguise his convictions and agenda, and one would not expect him to have much sympathy for the timber companies, the Army Corps of Engineers or Blade Runner fishing fleets with their sea-floor charts, video sonar, airplanes and satellite-generated maps of sea-surface temperature patterns. But what elevates his book above the usual environmental tract and makes it so compelling and involving is that he is genuinely besotted by fish, and his enthusiasm is infectious. A giant bluefin tuna jumps 50 yards from his boat, and he sees "the largest and most magnificent of animals, hung suspended for a long riveting moment, emblazoned and backlit like a saber-finned warrior from another world." He perceives in the scales of a just-landed salmon "a miniature gallery of abstract paintings, like an exhibit of similar lacquered works by the same artist, gathered and brilliantly displayed side by side so that the slight variations among them set up a subtle shimmer."
In his cautiously optimistic epilogue Safina mentions encouraging developments such as the revitalized striped bass run in the Atlantic, the 1995 United Nations ban on drift nets, new regulations requiring United States fisheries managers to end overfishing for most species and rebuild depleted populations and the increased awareness of fishermen from New England to Micronesia that their future depends on curbing overfishing and maintaining harvests at sustainable levels. But after the horror stories that have gone before, one finishes "Song for the Blue Ocean" wondering how this can be enough. The world's oceans are notoriously difficult to police, and as long as certain species of fish command astronomical prices (one 300-pound tuna recently sold for $83,500), and technology makes it easy to catch fish faster than they can reproduce, overfishing will continue, although perhaps at less catastrophic levels.
The best hope may lie in curbing demand, in more people coming to share Safina's insistence that fish must be seen "as wild animals in their habitats." If this happens, if the "sea ethic" he advocates becomes accepted and more people feel a sense of community with marine creatures, if it becomes as shameful to dine on rare fish lips as filet of gorilla, and pilots flying down the east side of Cape Cod again see schools of mackerel as large as Buzzard's Bay and the waters from Provincetown to Nauset white with schools of fish, then credit must certainly go at least in part to Carl Safina's landmark book.

HEADLINE: Surviving Fiscal Ruin (and Disco)

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN; Clyde Haberman writes the NYC column for The New York Times.

 BODY:
IN THE 70's, New York hit bottom.
Not that it stayed there for long. The city has always been too skilled at reinventing itself not to bounce back from hard times. But by the mid-70's, only an irredeemable optimist could keep the gremlins at bay, the ones that stalked the soul in the dead of night. Could it be, they hissed, that New York had finally had it? 
 There were so many reasons to answer yes, none more compelling than the discovery in 1974 that the city was broke.
A history of fiscal irresponsibility had finally caught up with it -- decades of doing nothing to stop the mass exodus of middle-class taxpayers or the wild spending on social services that could not possibly be afforded or City Hall's addiction to dubious fiscal gimmicks to keep itself afloat.
In 1974, the house of cards collapsed when banks refused to lend New York any more money. Bankruptcy loomed. The city had no choice but to swallow its pride and ask the Federal Government for a bailout, only to suffer the humiliation of having President Gerald R. Ford tell it to take a hike.
Eventually, the White House came through with Federal loan guarantees that enabled New York to get past the immediate crisis. But the initial rejection still stung. It had been been seared into the municipal consciousness by a 1975 headline in The Daily News that became an instant classic:
 
Ford to City:
Drop Dead
Lamentably, in the eighth decade of a unified New York, the rot went well beyond the local treasury. It ate into the very fabric of city life. Sure, there were periods when crime rates were higher and decades, like the 30's, when unemployment was a plague. But it is hard to think of times when New Yorkers felt as bad about themselves as they did in the 70's.
This was a decade when they learned about systemic police corruption and when Frank Serpico became a household name. It was a heart-of-darkness decade, the decade of the deranged killer known as Son of Sam. Terrorist bombings spread death in Manhattan and at La Guardia Airport, endless fires consumed the Bronx, and widespread looting accompanied a 1977 blackout, erasing memories of the we're-all-brothers sweetness that had marked the last big power failure, in 1965.
Longtime New Yorkers sensed their beloved city spinning out of control. Crime soared, and every other week seemed to bring a municipal strike. Garbage collectors walked out. So did doctors at city hospitals. In January 1971, the police went on strike for a few days, an action that was unheard of, not to mention illegal. Fortunately, temperatures hovered near zero the whole time. Even the muggers stayed home -- that's how cold it was. Crime actually went down while the cops were out.
The collapse of the old order was already detectable in the late 60's, only it did not feel so ominous, despite destructive episodes like a 1968 student strike at Columbia University. Change was taking place at every level.
I will never forget my shock on returning to New York in 1970 after two years in the Army, mostly in Europe. The beards, long hair, flamboyant clothes and foul language that used to be associated primarily with hippies and leftist rebels had gone mainstream. Even stockbrokers were dressing and talking like that.
Though odd, these stylistic innovations were not threatening. Other breaks from the past were merely wacky or giddy. Some were even hopeful. The once-hapless Mets did not just have a good team in 1969, their eighth year of existence. They won the World Series. Impossible! As impossible as a man walking on the moon, which, of course, also occurred in 1969.
As for local politics, what could be more screwy than two big-time writers running for high office: Norman Mailer for mayor and Jimmy Breslin for City Council president. Sure, they lost, which was probably just as well. But how could you not like a political campaign that ended with a candidate, Mr. Breslin, apologizing for having taken an active part in a process that closed the bars for a day?
The problem was there was so much change. It came so fast and so hard. And a lot of it was ugly. Even a city with infinite endurance could buckle, which is exactly what happened as the 70's wore grimly on.
New York almost gave up on itself. Brigades of businesses fled to the suburbs or left the region entirely, turning their backs on the city that had nurtured them.
Nothing of consequence ever seemed to get built in those days, and existing structures were being defiled by graffiti vandals. True, the World Trade Center was completed in the early 70's. But it was hardly the city's most glorious skyscraper and, besides, it had been planned long before.
Everywhere you turned, naysayers abounded. A new road was needed to replace the crumbling West Side Highway. Not a chance. Environmentalists blocked the project at every turn. It was almost as if the city had lost the ability to dream grandly, a failing that went beyond architecture. We had gone from the Champagne sophistication of Cole Porter in grandfather's day to the disco exhortations of the Bee Gees: uh uh uh uh stayin' alive. This was progress?
Then again, staying alive was the most many New Yorkers could think about. Broadway acknowledged as much when it moved up the evening curtain by an hour, to 7:30, so that tourists and suburbanites could make a clean getaway before the night stalkers filled Times Square.
HAVING said all this, let's be careful not to paint too depressing a picture. The second half of the 70's brought glimmers of hope for a city destined to rebound. The Broadway musical, which was ready to receive last rites, got a reprieve with "A Chorus Line." The long-dormant Yankees roared back. Operation Sail, a bicentennial spectacle of tall ships, lifted New York spirits. And in 1977, a new mayor was elected, one Ed Koch. He was certainly not fault-free. But he brought pizazz to a City Hall that had limped along under the colorless Abe Beame.
Even better, New York had the last laugh on Washington. The Democrats held their 1976 national convention at Madison Square Garden and went from that New York springboard to the White House. In the end, it was President Ford who was told by the voters to drop dead.

HEADLINE: Whatever Happened to Politics?;
When Naptime Is Over

BYLINE: By Robert B. Reich; Robert B. Reich, professor of social and economic policy at Brandeis University, was Secretary of Labor during President Clinton's first term.

 BODY:
There's no longer any political news, a reporter friend confided recently, explaining why "human interest" stories were oozing like syrup across his newspaper's front pages. We're in the Bland Decade now, a time when citizens march on Washington not to affect politics but to vow they'll be better people and when politicians speak out mainly to urge niceness: volunteer your time, enter into dialogues on race, hire someone off welfare, please. Apparently we need little more than charity, moral uplift and perhaps a modest program or two. Politics is dead, or so it seems.
The easiest explanation for this torpor is that the nation is fat, like an overstuffed bear starting hibernation. It's no longer the economy, stupid. Six years ago, a prolonged recession hurt white-collar workers, giving some urgency to the politics of "change." Prosperity, though, is a powerful sedative. Forget politics for now, we seem to be saying. Let's compare stock portfolios, banter about culture and identity and tut-tut over problems decades hence, like an insolvent Social Security trust fund or excessive greenhouse gases. 
 The great economic contests have been won. Communism vanished before it was even vanquished. The Japanese competitive threat is now a sorry heap of bad debt. European welfare states heave under double-digit unemployment. And here in the land of plenty we've never had it so good. Wealth is exploding, unemployment is at a 24-year low, inflation is quiescent (the Federal Reserve Board chairman, Alan Greenspan, publicly raised concerns about deflation), the stock market is riding high. American capitalism is the envy of the world.
But look more closely and the easy explanation falls short. Most Americans don't have it so good. They have jobs, but most wages and benefits are stuck or continue to drop. Wealth has exploded at the top, but the wages of people in the bottom half are lower today in terms of purchasing power than they were in 1989, before the last recession. This is in sharp contrast to every previous recovery in the postwar period. Corporate downsizing and mass layoffs are still the order of the day, which partly explains why so few workers demand raises in this tight labor market. They'd rather keep their jobs.
The reality is that Wall Street's advance hasn't been widely shared. The richest 1 percent hold more than 35 percent of the nation's wealth. The typical middle-class family has no more than $7,000 in stocks and $12,500 in mutual funds, according to a 1995 survey by the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department. Even the recent market surge isn't likely to have changed this very much, given what has happened to wages.
Whatever savings Americans do have are imperiled by hospital bills. A growing portion of the public lacks health insurance -- in 1989, 33 million Americans under age 65 were without it; by 1996, 41.3 million. (The President's proposal to extend Medicare coverage to early retirees and displaced workers as young as 55, which would be the largest expansion in 25 years, is expected to add only 300,000 to the rolls.)
Despite the boom, inequality has widened. The nation's poverty rate is slightly higher than it was before the last recession. In 1989, 12.6 million, or 19.6 percent, of the nation's children lived in poverty; now it's 14.5 million, or 20.5 percent. The Conference of Mayors reports rising demand for food and shelter among the homeless. And the successes of the civil rights movement notwithstanding, today's urban schools are more racially segregated than in the 1980's.
So why, then, the prevailing political somnolence? Traditional politics has been all about who's gaining and who's losing. Yet it has lately become unfashionable, indeed in poor taste, to notice such things. In the present upbeat climate, downbeat data are slightly subversive. It is necessary to minimize all worry about the economy lest the public lose confidence, a perfect tautology. Bankers and business leaders have become cheerleaders in the nationwide pep rally. Onward! Upward!
Recent polls show, accordingly, high rates of consumer confidence. A record 40 percent of consumers queried in the Conference Board's December survey called jobs "plentiful," although, tellingly, only 28 percent expected their own wages to rise. These are the ones who have heard the distant roar of surging wealth and assume that the rising tide will lift them, too -- which may explain the record level of consumer debt. Personal bankruptcies are also at a record high.
Will politics revive when the economic tide ebbs and hardships appear like shipwrecks on the tidal flats? Not necessarily. Even in 1992, with the nation mired in recession, political engagement was grudging. Americans wanted "change" to get the economy moving again. But there was no sense of moral urgency. It was simply time to replace old management with new. Most Americans had long before stopped believing in government as a force for much good in their lives.
Some people will say we don't need a vital politics to be a vital society. We can expand the circle of prosperity through grass-roots moral activism, spearheaded by community groups, socially responsible businesses, not-for-profits, religious organizations and compassionate individuals -- perhaps all deftly linked by fax and modem, a "virtual" social movement. Commentators rightly stress the importance of such civic engagement. But they make a serious mistake labeling it as an alternative to politics. Throughout our history, civic activism has been the precursor, and the propellant, of political movements.
Almost a century ago, American politics appeared similarly listless despite growing social problems. As today, the economy was booming, jobs were plentiful and vast fortunes were being accumulated. Yet real wages had stopped growing, and the gulf between rich and poor was widening into a chasm. New technologies (steam engines, railway locomotives, the telephone, steam turbines, electricity) were transforming the nation, pulling families off the farms and immigrants from abroad and depositing many into fetid slums. Wall Street magnates were consolidating their empires. Government was effectively bought by large corporations, and the broad public was deeply cynical. William McKinley won re-election -- legend has it, on a pledge to "stand pat" -- and as the century closed, the nation seemed politically comatose.
Within three years, however, there was an outburst of reform: muckrakers like Lincoln Steffens and Ida Tarbell exposed corruption, and the middle class demanded fundamental change; small businessmen railed at monopolies; Wisconsin's crusading Governor, Robert La Follette, enacted legislation regulating health and safety in factories; Oregon limited the hours of work for women (no more than 10 per day); Theodore Roosevelt, McKinley's energetic Vice President who took over after McKinley was assassinated, set out to bust the trusts; suffragists marched; campaigns were organized for pure food and drug laws, workers' compensation and a minimum wage. Politics gained new life and meaning.
What happened? Indignation, which had been rising steadily, suddenly burst out and flooded the country. Citizens were already active at the local level, as they are today. Common morality simply couldn't abide the way things were going. Yet instead of opting for revolution or radical change, Americans preferred to spread the benefits of the emerging industrial economy, thereby saving capitalism from its own excesses.
Another foreshadowing occurred in the placid Eisenhower era. The overall economy was doing nicely then as well, even though its benefits had not reached the rural poor, many of whom were black. Politics had grown inert. Ike golfed. In 1954, the Supreme Court decided that separate schools were not equal. In 1957, Eisenhower dispatched Federal troops to Little Rock's Central High School. But who could have predicted that within a few years the civil rights movement would have remolded American politics with the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965?
The next revival of American politics can be expected to follow a similar course. The current economic boom has bypassed too many; the gap between winners and losers has grown too wide. Fortunately, there is a common morality at the heart of this capitalist democracy that ultimately keeps us on track and keeps us together. Glimpses of it can be had even in these languid times. For example, a majority of Americans supported last year's increase in the minimum wage to $5.15, although only a tiny fraction stood to benefit. It was a matter of simple fairness. Or consider the broad-scale indignation stirred up by revelations of garment sweatshops.
We got another glimpse this summer, when a sudden groundswell of support forced a skinflint Congress to extend health care to millions of children. And a majority of Americans supported the United Parcel Service strikers, not because the public is particularly fond of organized labor but because it seemed unfair for U.P.S. to pay its part-time work force so little.
Recall also the firestorm when, almost exactly two years ago, AT&T announced it was firing some 40,000 employees and then gave the boss stock options that raised his total compensation to $16 million, from $6.7 million. Recall, by contrast, the celebration of Aaron Feuerstein, the owner of Malden Mills in Lawrence, Mass., who, after his synthetic-fleece business burned to the ground, assured his employees that he'd stick by them until the factory was rebuilt.
The pressure keeps rising. A final glimpse came just before the holidays, when the public signaled unease about giving the President "fast track" authority to whisk trade treaties through Congress without amendment and most members of the House of Representatives, including many Republicans, refused to support it. That may be a mistake. Trade is good for America. But the public's negative reaction shouldn't be seen as a repudiation of free trade. It was, at bottom, a matter of fairness: trade hurts some people, and we haven't made adequate provision for the losers.
Trade may, in fact, be the precipitating issue this time around. The economic implosion in East Asia will continue to reverberate here, as bahts, won, rupiahs, ringgit and yen drop in value relative to dollars -- one of the biggest price-cutting contests in world history. American consumers will have the benefit of bargain-basement sales, but the cheap imports will put additional downward pressure on the wages of lower-skilled Americans. The tumult also will crimp profits of American companies that export to the region, causing more layoffs here. If the Asian flu turns more deadly, the infection here will be all the worse. However resolved, the Asian crisis portends larger jolts, as the global economy absorbs the surging output of 1.2 billion Chinese -- more than a fifth of the world's population. When the current recovery ends, the underlying reality will be starkly evident and the political debate surrounding trade will intensify.
To an extent, that debate has already begun. The tension between economic nationalism and globalism is emerging as one of the most significant fissures in American politics, and it runs through both parties -- as shown by the current dispute over financing for the International Monetary Fund.
But it would be unfortunate indeed if the revival of American politics were to turn on the question of whether the nation should engage in more or less commerce with the rest of the world. The underlying choice is larger, more important and more subtle: ultimately, we must decide whether we want to slow the pace of globalization or else take bold steps to help today's losers share in the benefits of the new economy. I cannot predict the outcome of that great debate to come, but I can express a clear preference. It is that we expand the circle of prosperity and that we do so on a scale that matches the challenge.
A new nationalism founded on shared prosperity might, for example, support "re-employment insurance" that would enable people who lose their jobs to move to new ones with far less disruption and pain than is the norm today. (If the new job paid less, half the difference should be offset for a year by a wage subsidy.)
In that spirit, we could enlarge and expand the earned-income tax credit -- a reverse income tax that makes work pay if you're at or near the bottom. We could bring a larger portion of the next generation into the circle of prosperity by rebuilding decaying schools and helping states equalize spending between rich and poor school districts. And we would make sure that everyone has access to adequate health care and child care.
To finance all of this -- and move beyond the small, feel-good programs that lack adequate scale to make much of a difference -- we could simply reverse the current trend in public finance and adopt a truly progressive tax system (including payroll taxes).
None of this will come easily or without a fight. But in the end, the nation will be stronger and better for bringing everyone, or nearly everyone, along. Future historians looking back on the Bland Decade will conclude that, as before, American politics wasn't really dead. It was only caught napping.

HEADLINE: Whatever Happened to Politics?;
Washington Is Not Where It's At

BYLINE: By Garry Wills; Garry Wills wrote for The New York Times Magazine most recently about the revival of the classics.

 BODY:
Is Bill Clinton our first post-political President? It is hard to find, anywhere on the current scene, a politics of the sort once recognized as serious. There are no great debates on great issues. Party loyalty is down, voter apathy up. The vacuum in political interest is filled more and more by obsession with headline trials -- William Kennedy Smith, the Tonya Harding affair, the Menendez brothers, O. J. Simpson, Marv Albert, Louise Woodward, the Unabomber case. What still passes for politics will be absorbed into the vortex of trials when Paula Jones's suit against the President is brought into the courtroom.
Political problems continue to plague our world -- the gathering crisis in funds for entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare is one of them -- but we seem to lack the political machinery or public engagement to do much, if anything, about them. The welfare problem was put off rather than solved by "devolution." Even the conservative William Bennett says that devolution "has often meant reducing the Federal Government's capacity to monitor and correct." But since many other conservatives do not want the Federal Government to have any regulatory powers, the shifting of the problem satisfies antigovernment ideologues. 
 The President's only foreign-policy initiatives of last year, NATO expansion and "fast track" negotiating authority on trade, did not stir the public except (in the latter case) to opposition. Republicans in Congress were deserted even more spectacularly by their followers than were the Democrats on fast track by the labor unions. When Congress tried to implement the Gingrich "revolution" of 1995, it found that Congressional popularity ratings "fell like a rock" (in Bennett's phrase). Both the President and Congress seem like sailors in a dead calm. They work the rudder back and forth but nothing happens to make the boat respond. One needs at least some slight breeze of public opinion. But public engagement in politics has been so veering and contradictory as only to flap the sail sluggishly.
Without a stable structure of political debate, the electorate shows mood swings rather than a "climate of opinion." In 1994, Republicans interpreted some sour growling as a deep disgust with government. But by 1996, the swing toward complacency made Clinton so scandalproof that Bennett asked, "Have we lost our capacity for justified outrage?" The current prosperity cannot explain a falling off of political debate that precedes it. Whether the public is disaffected or complacent, the result seems the same -- stasis and dead air.
Perhaps we are not finding political life around us because we are looking for it in the wrong places. We may have to redefine politics, not confining it to high policy in foreign and economic affairs. Certainly the old party lines do not give us much guidance. In fact the parties have been changing places in a weird dos-a-dos. It was a Democratic President who said that "the era of big government is over" -- only to see a whole string of Republicans argue the need for strong central government. William Kristol, Eliot A. Cohen, David Brooks and John DiIulio have joined Bennett in saying that national greatness depends more on the approach of Alexander Hamilton and Theodore Roosevelt than on Reagan's maxim that government is the problem, not the solution. Faced with such role shifts, the public has a right to be puzzled, to say what the detective Philip Marlowe does when challenged to say whose side he is on. He just shrugs, "I don't even know who's playing today."
Confused or fading loyalty to the political parties made the commentator David Broder, long a champion of measures to strengthen the two-party system, give up on his efforts in 1996, when he wrote that Ross Perot was the one figure addressing new realities. I asked him about that at the 1996 California convention of Perot's political party, United We Stand America. He responded with a gesture at the proceedings, "This is the future." Well, it was yesterday's future. Futures, like everything else in today's politics, have a brief shelf life.
The emptiness of modern politics has come home with special force to conservatives, who feel they have won victory after victory with little to show for it. What does victory mean in a political vacuum? That is a question many conservatives are asking. Their discomfort has led to anguished symposiums on the possibility of a "conservative crackup." Contributors to one such discussion, in The Weekly Standard, had various explanations of the crisis. Some claimed that in a political situation where little if anything is firmly nailed down, Bill Clinton simply filched the conservatives' slogans and agenda, moving their accomplishments over into his win column.
Others, writing in the religious journal First Things, decided that in the absence of electoral impact, the Supreme Court is ruling the nation, unconstitutionally; so conservatives should consider going outside a political system that has no legitimacy. That is a measure of the desperation that can be caused by a "failure of politics."
Pat Buchanan has for a long time been saying that conservatives have won the political war but lost the cultural war. Politics with no cultural impact is a feckless exercise. Neoconservatives agree with that point, if not with other Buchananisms. And the neoconservatives' foe, R. Emmett Tyrell, who started the talk about a "conservative crackup" in an article 10 years ago and wrote a book by that title in 1992, traces the conservatives' feeble cultural impact to a lack of respected elders who could legitimize authentically conservative positions while marginalizing kooks and opportunists:
"There was a hierarchy of conservatives, but it was not acting as a hierarchy. It was not analyzing the younger conservatives' work. It was not pointing to new areas for conservative endeavors. It failed to recognize the charlatans among the younger conservatives and the bright fellows among the dolts. . . .It did not scotch the proliferation of fly-by-night organizations that were draining off the movement's precious funds."
Tyrell said the conservatives needed their own "wise men," who could do for them what Bernard Baruch or Clark Clifford had done for the liberals.
David Gelernter, the computer specialist, has tried to spell out the content of a cultural offensive of the sort Buchanan and Tyrell call for. He says conservatives must erect a counter-Establishment, complete with new universities that will be "apolitical," concentrating on the cultural arena previously abandoned to liberals: "I would put aside politics for a while and plant bushes, attempt to stabilize the culture."
The odd thing is that conservatives are calling for their own Establishment when what used to be called the Establishment has disappeared. It is quite true that there used to be an agenda-setting elite that informally decreed what political positions were serious, marginalizing all others. The tip of this Establishment iceberg was the "wise men," that body of elite corporate lawyers or investment bankers called in, when crises arose, to authenticate the needed policies. These men -- John J. McCloy, Robert Lovett, Dean Acheson, Chip Bohlen, Clark Clifford, George Kennan, Averell Harriman, Douglas Dillon and others -- were turned to by Republican as well as Democratic Presidents. Lovett, for instance, was favored for almost any position by Eisenhower and Kennedy. Kennedy called on the wise men for help in the Cuban crisis, and Johnson for his efforts to get out of Vietnam. (Getting in he had handled on his own.)
The wise men had high standards of public service, but their power did not come simply from their own integrity or charm. They had ties to the best universities and law firms, to philanthropic foundations and think tanks, to Wall Street, to the world of international finance, to "responsible" journalists like Walter Lippmann and James Reston. They embodied the shared ideals of these interlocking institutions and radiated their own authority back through what was taught, financed or published as politically serieux.
This Establishment was not liberal but centrist. That was its warrant for bipartisan consensus on the mixed economy (neither socialist nor unbridled laissez-faire) and on the international order (anti-Communist, nonisolationist, Eurotropic). From this assurance of centrality the Establishment could marginalize "extremists" -- a Joseph McCarthy on the right, a Henry Wallace on the left. Even in the narrow spectrum of Presidential politics, noncentrists could be marginalized -- Barry Goldwater on the right, George McGovern on the left. So powerful was this ideal of "mainstream" politics that historians at the peak of the wise men's influence read their ideals back through our national life to create the "consensus school" of American historiography. Talk of the "bland" Eisenhower era was a less flattering way to describe the same state of affairs.
This solid center of agreement underwent fission in the late 1960's. Walter Isaacson and Evan Thomas, who described the Establishment's 50-year reign in their book "The Wise Men" (1986), said that disagreement over the Vietnam War divided the wise men and their cognate academics -- a split made highly visible in the disagreement of Establishment journalists Lippmann (against the war) and Joseph Alsop (for the war).
I.M. Destler, Leslie Gelb and Anthony Lake, writing two years earlier in "Our Own Worst Enemy," thought the whole structure topped by the wise men was coming apart even before Vietnam. The wise men were the best representatives of a privileged elite with paternalistic motives of public service. After World War II, a meritocratic professionalism entered the governmental recruiting process. It allowed non-WASP, nonprivileged, nonamateur meritocrats -- Henry Kissinger, Stanley Hoffmann, Edward Luttwak, Walter Laqueur, Zbigniew Brzezinski -- to achieve an influence that would have been exercised earlier by heirs to a familial and legal "old boy" network. These new professionals did not have the assumed power of people whose careers rested on status and its presuppositions. Their rank depended on up-to-the-minute information, policy expertise and ambitious maneuvering.
I think one can go deeper, in 1997, than did those books of the 80's. The extraordinary authority of the wise-men structure arose in part from its ability to focus narrowly on what was circumscribed as "politics." Roughly, this amounted to high policy (foreign and economic) and its relation to national elections. Local police matters were not high politics as the wise men understood that. Averell Harriman was looked at askance by his peers when he ran for governor of New York -- which was more akin to garbage collecting than to wise-man policy-making.
Other parts of life were not directly political, because they defined themselves as subsidiary to the "real" issues. Religion was a private matter except when seen as a prop for the Establishment. Women, too, were not serious in political terms unless they rose by virtue of their association with Establishment men -- married to them like Eleanor Roosevelt or Lindy Boggs, dispensing their wealth to philanthropic and charity events or educating their daughters at finishing schools and Seven Sisters colleges. Though some of the wise men were notable womanizers, they disapproved when Nelson Rockefeller went beyond affairs to get a divorce. The family, like religion, was a civil institution making for stability.
Some of the wise men were racists -- not that it mattered, since racial relations were not a part of politics as they defined the subject. Such relations were adverted to mainly to keep them out of the sphere of high politics. George Kennan once wrote that the Founding Fathers would "turn over in their graves at the mere thought of the democratic principle being applied to a population containing over 10 million Negroes." In 1965, Kennan said, "I have a soft spot in my heart for apartheid," and he greeted racial unrest in 1968 by saying it is unrealistic "to suppose that the American Negro is going to find his dignity and comfort of body and mind by the effort to participate and to compete as an individual in a political and social system he neither understands nor respects and for which he is ill prepared."
I do not mean to castigate Kennan individually. He was voicing some of the maxims of his time and upbringing. Most of the wise men were born around the beginning of the century, and they reached their days of glory when they were already becoming anachronisms. But it is important to remember that an earlier form of "political correctness" let elite institutions deal with religion, women and blacks in demeaning ways.
David Gelernter, speaking for the conservative counterculturalists, agrees with the professionalization thesis to explain the downfall of the Establishment. He calls the professionals "intellectuals" and says the social elite committed suicide by admitting the intellectuals into positions of privilege. "Nothing compelled the Harvards and the Yales to change their ways. They did it by volunteering to make room for a new elite." In that sense, the fall of the Establishment was "a bloodless coup inside the generals' tent within the tiny upper stratum that calls the shots and sets the tone."
This view of elite-only actors is "top down" history with a vengeance. Actually, of course, many forces were in play -- demography, education, technology, the ideological aftermath of World War II. The work force was altered during that war by women's entry into it and by huge influxes of black labor moving up from the south (1.5 million people in the 1940's). American attacks on Hitler's "racism" (the word was invented during his rise) combined with the morale-boosting egalitarianism professed in the military to stir awareness of our own racial problems. Blacks, pressing for integration of the military under Truman, found it hard, on leaving the military base, to plunge back into segregation in the South.
The business side of the Establishment was, meanwhile, creating the affluence and technology that would erode its own connections with authority. Television brought alternate life styles into every living room. A youth culture grew up from the sale of music, movies, clothes and vehicles aimed at the teen-age market. College students now brought a whole culture of their own onto the campus, eroding the colleges' paternalistic (in loco parentis) role. Students did not go straight from their parents' house to an in-loco college, as before. They passed through an intermediary arena of rock music, youth-culture heroes and -- increasingly -- drugs.
In the 60's, this culture almost declared its independence from the earlier socialization processes for the young. Radicals were, by their own self-definition, not merely marginal to "the system" but opposed to it -- antipolitical in that sense. Hippies were hedonists not to be taken seriously except as symptoms of cultural decay. Yippies said hedonism could be a political act -- and they were right. The time of the radicals passed, but hippie culture, through all its manifold echoes, helped along the sexual revolution, the women's movement and changes in the context of marriage.
Conservatives like to treat the 60's as the end of civilization as we knew it, but the right, too, had a role in bringing a "marginal" cultural activity -- religion -- into politics. If abortion is murder, political opposition to it (or even more direct action) must be promoted. Operation Rescue deliberately imitated the civil rights movement's tactics, with Randall Terry delighting in "street theater." Fundamentalists, neglected by the Establishment (which only had eyes, occasionally, for "mainline" religion), gave up their former passivity to turn electoral politics toward things like school prayer, opposition to sex education and the distribution of condoms or the denial of rights to homosexuals.
The old Establishment quietly assumed that separation of church from state entailed a separation of religion from politics. But the First Amendment, which forbids the state from establishing a church, also provides for free exercise of religion and of speech, meaning that one can vote and argue from one's religiously formed conscience. There were many "walls of separation" in the old definition of politics. Each of these walls has been swept away in the last three decades. The citadel was not, as Gelernter argues, surrendered. It was engulfed.
The restriction of politics to "the system," which meant primarily the electoral system, can no longer be enforced. The women's movement did not score great electoral victories -- in fact, it lost the vote on the Equal Rights Amendment to Phyllis Schlafly's expertly organized opposition. But women's status changed, more than ever in human history, over the last three decades. This is a perfect example of what the conservatives call winning the political war and losing the cultural war. But it no longer makes sense to distinguish the two. Politics in the old sense has been emptied out. The fall of the Soviet Union shattered the cold-war consensus on foreign policy. The paralysis of economic initiatives -- temporarily by the deficit, in the longer range by growing entitlement spending -- has made "Establishment" domestic policy nonexistent. Real change -- sweeping, unprecedented change -- has not been taking place because of the electoral system. The electoral system is, instead, a lagging and imperfect indicator of such changes.
Right-wingers call it illegitimate for blacks or women or homosexuals to seek rights in the courts rather than by voting for candidates who agree with them. "Rights" has become a swear word on the right: we are too concerned with rights. We should go back to just counting votes. Republicans, not Democrats, are our new superdemocrats, the defenders of elections as the sole arbiters of political life. Everything else is "culture," and decadent -- feminism, affirmative action, gay rights, rock music, drugs, the whole evil catalogue.
The absurdity of trying to separate our current politics from culture is seen in Gelernter's proposal for counter-Establishment colleges and other institutions.
"The new institutions I have in mind would have no political agenda," he writes. "They would merely promote cant-free history, apolitical art, nonfeminist news reporting for the masses, the teaching of technique and not self-esteem, moral seriousness, ideology-free language -- items that today's elite despises and is attempting to destroy."
He advocates ideology-free language in ideology-laden language. Nonfeminism is, for him, "apolitical." "Cant-free history" is the old Establishment history, with George Kennan's politically correct views on women, blacks and religion. Gelernter is admirably candid about wanting to imitate the old Establishment, the one that was destroyed (he believes) by meritocratic "intellectuals." But that Establishment was built up on structures of privilege -- the right prep schools and colleges, the right clubs and relatives and law firms, the long experience derived from a semi-monopoly of prestigious positions. These things were not created overnight, and even they had to crumble in a vast sea of social change.
Gelernter cannot build on the kind of silent assumptions that were only "nonpolitical" because they were not, for a long time, challenged. He can find no Burkean subsoil from which to grow his institutions. They would have to be formed from raw and immediate attack on the "culture" he dislikes -- formed, in fact, with right-wing money coaxed from "nonintellectual" corporations and foundations on the promise of creating a nonintellectual elite, a new order of right-wing "wise men." Gelernter, to reach his goal, would have to give ideological preference to his weird form of "apolitical" students, just as the old Establishment favored its own kind, excluding Jews or blacks or Catholics or Asians.
It is interesting that conservatives, in order to wrest short-term gains against affirmative action, have become strict meritocrats themselves, considering only the individual's performance in deciding who gets into the right colleges or the right law firms. These superdemocrats ignore the way privilege was indulged in at most of our higher institutions of learning through most of their history. That privilege was justified as socially useful because it built up the shared experience and cumulative wisdom needed to guide the nation's economic and policy-making elite. It produced men like the wise men. If a quota kept out all but a few Jews, that was the price of training wise men.
The "culture" both Gelernter and his conservative fellows despise argues in the same way for socially useful preferences, but to serve egalitarian rather than elite values. It values sexual and ethnic diversity, and hopes to provide stimuli for the economically disadvantaged (as the old system provided cushions for the less-bright boys -- but not girls -- in the right families). Now goals are set for purposes of inclusion, not exclusion, to bring in more Americans, not to exclude one specific body. The comparison of affirmative action with old Ivy League quotas for Jews is disingenuous. White males are not targets for exclusion under affirmative action. They still make up the vast majority of people in colleges, law firms and corporations. What bothers some is that white males are not given the assured entry that upper-class WASP's used to have to "their" schools.
If culture is no longer neatly walled off from politics, does that mean that a flood of barbarism has inundated our institutions, as Allan Bloom and Robert Bork contend? Is right order falling victim to a "rights" culture? That is one (apoplectic) way of looking at our recent history.
Another way is to see the half-century of the Establishment as a deviation, one caused by the need to respond to a long-continuing crisis (Depression, World War, cold war), in which elites were given emergency powers. The longer-run progress of the nation was interrupted by this arrangement, delaying certain developments that rushed onto the scene when that interruption ended -- long-delayed business dealing with women's rights, with race relations, with child-rearing ideals.
The brightest side of American history has been the slow but persistent spread of egalitarianism. That ideal was there, though still nugatory, when Jefferson wrote that all men are created equal. By the 1820's, egalitarianism was pronounced enough for Tocqueville to find in it one of our definitive features -- even though slavery still existed in the 1820's, women could not vote and workers had few guaranteed rights. The rest of the 19th century saw the spread of equality. In the struggle over slavery, Lincoln encouraged us to read the Constitution, which lacks the words "all men are created equal," in light of that ideal (to the horror of a constitutional fundamentalist like Robert Bork). Freed blacks and voting women and children protected by child-labor laws still had a long way to go. It took the martyrdom of civil rights leaders to inch us on again in the unending war on racism. Women and homosexuals were pilloried for advancing their rights.
Some think that attention to different groups' rights is divisive, productive of social "balkanization." But these critics are the ones who speak as if attention to Martin Luther King in history books were a sop to blacks rather than a matter of pride for all Americans. The civil rights movement is our modern epic, the great social achievement of our time. Not to celebrate it is not to be truly alive to our own achievements. The current changes in women's status, unparalleled in the past, recognize the talents and dignity of more than half the human race, a momentous activity that goes to the inmost nexus of society, affecting the relations of wives to husbands, daughters to fathers, sisters to brothers, mothers to daughters. It is one of the most exciting breakthroughs in all of human history. Yet the "non-divisive" and "apolitical" Gelernter wants to set up new institutions to oppose this development by ignoring it, to achieve "nonfeminist" news reporting. Not reporting the advances of feminism now would be like not reporting the Civil War in the 1860's because ending slavery had its unpleasantnesses.
The egalitarianism of our culture affects everyone today, even the right-wingers who deplore many of its aspects. Advanced interactive communication -- call-in radio and television programs, the Internet, cellular phones -- all these encourage each person to have an equal say in things, to be his or her own expert; and no one has leapt at this opportunity more than conservatives. These right-wingers have taken up Tom Hayden's old concept of "participatory democracy." They won't let the powers that be tell them what to think. Such conservatives are rights-oriented. They think rights are being taken from them by the courts, by affirmative action, by religious discrimination. They propel the culture even as they denounce it.
I go back to my beginning. Is Bill Clinton our first post-political President? If we take "politics" in the old Establishment sense -- international and economic policy, along with the electoral system -- then he definitely is. The proof is here: his early priorities on taking office were "rights issues" -- recognizing gay rights in the military and working for greater participation of women in the Government. Those who judge politics by the old standards said that these actions showed he was not a "serious" politician but a marginalized one, an extremist. Well, perhaps he was premature, and certainly he was not deft in his handling of either issue. But he, not his critics, was recognizing the real world we live in. This, Mr. Broder, and not Ross Perot, "is the future."
Many people continue, if only subconsciously, to treat cultural questions -- "rights" issues, "identity politics," "multiculturalism" -- as intrusions into "real" politics. They act as if these were fads of the 60's, bits of hedonism or "self-expression" that will pass away when Americans become adults again. But coping with the vast culture of change now at work will provide the challenge of coming years. What is America as a social entity going to make of itself?
The explosion of ethnic diversity guarantees that affirmative action of some sort will be needed so that everyone feels a stake in a country that is literally changing complexion every day: whites will be a minority by early in the next century. What does that imply about the education, cultural heritage and social values of a community also undergoing technological changes of a dizzying sort? Panicky clampdowns on immigration will not put off the basic change in the makeup of our population.
Women will keep changing the shape of family life. Businesses will continue to use affirmative action, to the disgust of many conservatives, to accommodate diversity of customers and workers. (Right- wingers deplore the open recognition of homosexuals, but businesses know that gay and lesbian buying power, at an estimated $100 billion a year, is greater than that of, for instance, far more numerous blacks.)
People who deplore "rights politics" ain't seen nothin' yet. Rights to privacy, access and inclusion will be in play and in question at every level of our changing society and will spill over from the schools, the churches, the courts and the media into electoral politics.
John Kennedy said that a generation tempered by World War II was equipped to handle the cold war. He was describing, though he did not know it, the peak time and the passing of the old politics of the Establishment. Now a generation that experienced the deep social re-evaluations of the 60's is the one that can cope with the ongoing consequences of that reorientation. Politics in this new sense is alive and well -- indeed too lively for some people's nerves. And there are no wise men around to salve things for us. We may have to rely on wise women.

HEADLINE: Masks and More: Art Objects of Oceania

BYLINE: By BESS LIEBENSON 

 BODY:
VIEWERS may be transported to the other side of the world, to the Sepik River region of New Guinea, considered the most important art center in the region known as Oceania. In "Spirit Images: The Lidz Collection of Southwest Pacific Art," an exhibition at the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History in New Haven through Sept. 27, themes include the separation of sexes and relationship of the dead to the living.
The exhibition is drawn from the private collection of Theodore and Ruth Wilmanns Lidz, psychiatrists who, in the early 1970's collected extensively in Melanesia. Their acquisitions, donated to the Peabody Museum in 1986, document the culture of Zanuatu and parts of Papua New Guinea, just as those areas were beginning to experience extensive contact with other cultures. 
 New Guinea is divided into two culturally contrasting areas. "The people of the central highlands place importance on individual economic success, experience minimum cult life and religious ceremonies, do not venerate war heroes and conspicuously lack art, except in forms of singing and bodily decoration," said Leopold J. Pospisil, Peabody curator emeritus and professor emeritus of anthropology, who spent three years (beginning in 1954) as the first white man to enter and research the unmapped highlands of New Guinea.
In contrast, Mr. Pospisil said, "the lowland people emphasize ceremonial warfare, sometimes combined with cannibalism, are preoccupied with religious ritual and cult life and are unusually gifted in wood carving." The most intricate wood carvings spring from areas of the middle and lower Sepik River and its tributaries, the Yuat and Keram. Since prehistoric times the river has been the artery along which aboriginal traders transported and sold carvings for use in secret rites and elaborate public ceremonies. The Sepik peoples produced objects like suspension hooks, canoe prow figures, flute stoppers, masks, plaques, shields and chair-shaped lecterns.
Entry to the Peabody exhibition is through a permanent exhibition in the hall of Native American cultures. Swathed in red, it becomes a promenade and prologue to the exhibition of the moment. Songs and chants from the interior of New Guinea, recorded by Mr. Pospisil, add a compelling quality to an exotic setting: floors shimmering black, walls shaded in blue and painted with tropical foliage. And by a mechanical trick, shadows, clouds, even forest vapors appear to roll by.
The exhibition opens with an ornately carved canoe, its prow sculptured into stylized hornbill birds, set in an improvised sea. A carved head on the wall represents a human skull. "They originally used real skulls that they pasted over and painted," Mr. Pospisil noted. Multilevel cubes zig-zag in a circle heralding objects: lime containers, headdresses, beak-like masks inlaid with shells and a sacred flute stopper. Individual flutes played during male adult-initiation ceremonies were believed to emit voices of the spirits.
Men were initiated by elaborate rituals into graded societies, during their lives progressing through the ranks. A highlight display is of a men's house, used for secret rites, a storehouse and center of ceremonial life. Thatched with palm leaves, the tall facade reveals an interior of vividly painted bark clothes and masks. Outside, a stool, carved from a single piece of wood, depicts a male ancestral figure supporting a seat on his shoulders. Speakers, emphasizing a motion, beat the seat with palm leaves.
"Collections like this are invaluable, not only because they cannot be duplicated," said Richard L. Burger, director of the Peabody Museum, "but also because they exemplify the critical stages a culture has gone through as it transforms itself over time."
"Colonialism destroyed their art," Mr. Pospisil added. "In the lower Sepik River, the people are now resurrecting their lost art, copying the art of their ancestors from museums in the West."
The Peabody Museum of Natural History (170 Whitney Avenue, New Haven) is open Monday-Saturday 10 A.M.-5 P.M., Sunday noon-5 P.M.

HEADLINE: Retirees, Refusing to Stand Pat, Infuse Communities

BYLINE: By JOY ALTER HUBEL

 BODY:
WHOEVER said there's no future in retirement should meet Marvin Levine. Since resigning from the Psychology Department of the State University at Stony Brook six years ago, he has been writing and publishing poetry, playing in an orchestra and giving lectures on the psychology of Buddhism.
"The thought of retiring to Florida to be in summer camp the rest of my life just didn't interest me," said Mr. Levine. 
 Many Long Islanders share his view, and are discovering a rich variety of pleasures and possibilities in the region, experts say.
Rene Iacona, Commissioner of Nassau County Department of Senior Citizen Affairs, noted that many people now reaching their 60's were healthy, well educated and eager to continue contributing meaningfully to their communities.
"They want to stay near their families, or are being asked to help with their grandchildren," she said. "Long Island has a lot to offer these older adults. We have great health care, great parks, lots of culture and a low crime rate."
Prof. Christopher Hayes, director of the Gerontology Center at Long Island University's Southampton campus, agrees that Southern migration among the retired has slowed, and adds that many older adults were becoming influenced by their children's progressive ideas on retirement.
"There is an anti-aging rebellion going on in some groups of the retirement population," he said. "You are seeing an intergenerational exchange of concepts in which older generations are looking at younger generations and attempting to have the kind of free-spirited retirement their children aspire to."
This intergenerational exchange is producing a curious reversal in which the parents have become the social radicals and their children the economic conservatives, said Rhoda Spinner, a retired teacher and the event coordinator of Stony Brook's Round Table, an educational cooperative run by and for retired adults.
While baby boomers, the original practitioners of the alternative life style, are working the 10-hour-day treadmill, Ms. Spinner indicated, their parents, former bulwarks of conformity, are traveling, fulfilling their artistic longings and lobbying for social change.
Louis Boroson, a retired high school teacher from Stony Brook, became a volunteer for the A.F.L.-C.I.O. last year, and spent last summer in New York City, picketing with striking steel workers and petitioning against sweat shops.
Mickey and Arthur Meyer of Stony Brook worked on the restoration of a pueblo church in New Mexico.
Robert and Irma Mandel, retired teachers from Huntington Station, have spent parts of their retirement trekking through the Himalayas, snorkeling in Belize, teaching English in Japan and backpacking in Australia. The Mandels are leading a life style more like college students than retired teachers.
"We took early retirement 10 years ago when we were 55, and we haven't regretted it for a minute," Mr. Mandel said. "But we lived very frugally, at least for the first few years, and had to do some careful financial planning to make it possible."
At the start of their retirement, they moved to Japan, where they subsisted on the local economy while teaching English. After three months of living in an apartment the size of a futon, they saved enough for a trip around the world. Since then, they have crisscrossed the globe several times, stopping in Laos, Nepal, China, Thailand, Australia, Bali and Tibet. Last year, the Mandels canceled a planned trip to Syria when the country announced a cholera outbreak, but barring plague and pestilence, nothing much stops them.
Whenever they return from foreign trekking, the Mandels take their travel slides on the road to libraries and schools throughout Long Island. Their photographs form the core of a program in which they chronicle the various countries they visit, using, as props regional artifacts and dress.
"We show slides that portray the country," said Ms. Mandel. "Our photos of Laos capture the real country. Most Laotians, for example, live in straw shacks that have been built on stilts to protect against monsoons. Their villages have neither electricity nor plumbing. They bathe in the Mekong Delta and feed their livestock from the shell casings left from the Vietnam War."
Ms. Mandel said that she and her husband tried to convey the material poverty as well as the cultural richness of these countries.
"We American's don't realize how many comforts we have, and how well we live compared to the rest of the world," she said.
The Mandels say that their programs are particularly popular among the elderly, who attend the travelogues to satisfy their own world curiosity, without having to leave town themselves.
For those less itinerant retirees on the Island, there are ample avenues of enrichment right off the Long Island Expressway. Of growing popularity are the university-sponsored Learning in Retirement programs, where seniors can embark on the self-exploration that was once the specialty of their college-bound children 30 years ago.
Five Learning in Retirement programs exist in the region, including Stony Brook's Round Table, the Center for Creative Retirement at Long Island University's Southampton campus, the Professional and Executive's Retirement Center at Hofstra, the Institute for Life Long Learning at Molloy College and the Institute for Learning and Retirement at SUNY Farmingdale.
Though each program has its own personality, they function in much the same style. For a yearly fee of about $200, the retirees can take a variety of peer-taught courses, ranging from the academic to the practical. At Hofstra, for example, "The Byzantine Dynasty" is offered along with "Introduction to Computers."
For the price of enrollment, program members have access to many of the sponsoring university's offerings, including gym, library, cultural events, classroom space and auditing privileges.
They also enjoy unique social advantages. "People form relationships not on the basis of age, but on the basis of common interests," said Carl Siegel, president of the Round Table.
Many of the learning centers also encourage their members to do volunteer work on campus, as a way of giving back to the community that supports them. The Round Table, for example, surveys the skills of its enrollees and places them in volunteer roles within the university.
"We have members who are career counseling, tutoring and mentoring students throughout the campus," said Mr. Siegel.
Most learning in retirement programs operate like co-ops, with members both creating and consuming the principal commodity, which is knowledge. Those who take courses also give back, through teaching or volunteering. Program instructors have creative leeway in presenting their subjects. They can invite guest lecturers from within the university, have students attend cultural events on campus or plan outside trips.
"At first, we started planning day trips," said Ms. Spinner. "We've been to Harlem, to the Monet exhibit at the Brooklyn Museum, to the city for operas and plays. These trips worked so well that we got a bit braver and started planning weekend jaunts to places like Tanglewood and Philadelphia. Now 60 of us are going to Turkey in the spring."
Some speculate that Long Island colleges, so effective at addressing the social and intellectual needs of the retirees, might be on the verge of doing something about their housing too. Mr. Siegel and Ms. Spinner said that developers were considering building a retirement community to be affiliated with Stony Brook University, on adjacent property.
This college-retirement connection is not as much of a stretch as it seems, at least in other parts of the country. Many universities, including Duke, Yale, Cornell and the University of Virginia, are medically or financially affiliated with retirement communities
In part, the growth of continuing care communities across the country is reinforcing the college-retirement connection.
A continuing care community is a one-site-fits-all retirement complex. It provides a mix of independent housing, assisted living and nursing-home care on one campus. Residents move through these graduated levels of care on an as-needed basis. Many continuing care communities are being built in college towns to take advantage of the health care services and enriched cultural life the universities provide.
Though popular in other states, continuing care communities have been slow to develop in New York. The state's restrictive legislation prevented their development. New legislation, passed last September, reverses many of those restrictions and gives potential continuing care community sponsors a wide range of financing and contracting options.
Residents can either purchase continuing care units as a source of equity or rent them. Additional entrance and monthly fees pay for maintenance and health care costs over the life of the tenant.
Peconic Landing in Southold, which is based on the equity model, will be Long Island's first continuing care community. U.S. Retirement Communities Inc., a Pennsylvania-based builder of retirement complexes in Arizona and Pennsylvania, is developing it. .
Peconic Landing will begin construction in the fall of 1998, but has already begun marketing its 250 independent units. The units, to be built on waterfront property, will sell for $200,000 to $450,000. There will also be assisted living quarters and nursing beds. Its list of amenities reads like the contents of a resort brochure, and includes pools, tennis courts, library, barbershop and beauty salon, auditorium, recreational programs, maid service and dining. Continuing care communities like Peconic Landing appeal mostly to upper-income retirees. They do little to alleviate the housing shortage many middle and lower income retirees face.
By the year 2000 more than 20 percent of Long Island's population will be over 60. This demographic tilt, which will become even more pronounced when baby boomers begin turning 60 in another decade, has made housing a particularly visible target of change, said Lee Koppelman, director of the Long Island Regional Planning Board.
"Once upon a time, Long Island towns refused to zone for adult condominiums and apartment-style residences," he said. "They were afraid it would impoverish schools, reduce tax bases and destroy the suburban landscape. But now many of the people who opposed these residences 20 years ago are the ones who need them most."
Commissioner Iacona already sees a concerted effort on the part of developers to meet the housing needs of the aging. And because Suffolk Country has more space, and lower property taxes than neighboring Nassau, it is likely to be the recipient of much of that development.
Suffolk County, and particularly the East End, has already become a retirement mecca. Approximately 27 percent of the population in eastern Suffok is 60 years and older. This trend is fueled, in part, by many empty-nest couples, who are transforming their summer cottages into year-round retirement homes. With its natural beauty, convenient transportation into New York City and innumerable cultural resources, an East End retirement appeals to many who would ordinarily be lured south.
Fran Kelly, a librarian at Suffolk Community College and a former resident of Smithtown, recently bought a home in Southampton. "The towns out here are small, intimate and picturesque," she said. "It's next to impossible to find this kind of small town life style in other suburban areas of Long Island. And then of course, there's the beach," which, Ms. Kelly said, is as beautiful as anything Florida has to offer.

HEADLINE: Q&A: David Lerner;
Advocating a 'Safe' Route in Investment

BYLINE: By SUSAN KONIG

 BODY:
"THE tree doesn't grow to the sky," said David Lerner, referring to recent record highs set by the stock market. As chief executive officer of the Syosset-based David Lerner Associates, one of the nation's largest regional dealers of municipal bonds, Mr. Lerner recommends that investors put just a small portion of their investable assets into the stock market, with the remainder in "safe" investments like tax-free and zero coupon bonds.
His message is conveyed often through his regular seminars and well-known radio ad campaign, in which he asks listeners to "Take a tip from Poppy." His company, which has five locations including Wall Street, Teaneck, N.J., and Coral Springs, Fla., helps investors create retirement portfolios consisting mainly of conservative, fixed-income vehicles. Mr. Lerner is a graduate of the City University of New York, where he also earned a master's degree. He was a history and economics teacher in the South Bronx, then at Bayside High School in Queens -- until 1976, when he entered the financial services industry full-time. 
 Mr. Lerner lives in Jericho with his wife, Lois. They have two children and three grandchildren.
Q. How did you go from school teacher to running your own brokerage?
A. It's something I never expected to do. In 1960, I took a part-time job selling mutual funds to help make ends meet. But, it couldn't have been more out of character for me. I was a teacher -- the scholarly type -- and my views at the time weren't very business-like. Politically, I was very liberal -- you might even say I was a Socialist. My credo was, "Man doesn't live by bread alone."
But I got into the business because I believed I could apply the skills I used as a teacher, like communication and organization, to "educate" clients -- make them familiar with all different types of conservative investments. The approach worked. In 1976, I started David Lerner Associates, and it's been my life ever since. We're still very educational. We put concepts into understandable language so that everyone can see how investments work. My seminars are very much like being in a classroom. I think what I've really done is just continued my teaching career.
Q. You favor the heavy use of fixed-income vehicles and are rather leery of the stock market?
A. From the very start, we've focused on investments with relatively little risk so that our clients would know what they'd be getting in returns. They knew there was a guaranteed maturity date, etc. Our main focus in the early years -- and to a large degree today -- is tax-free municipal bonds. The attraction is a very high historical degree of safety, the fact that you have these significant tax advantages and that you know you're going to get 100 cents on the dollar at maturity. Your interest rate won't go up or down; it's a fixed rate of return. And this is a liquid investment.
Q. Why do you take such a conservative approach?
A. We believe that sharp declines in the stock market should make for interesting dinner conversation, but they shouldn't be a matter of life and death. If they are, you've made some very bad investment decisions. For almost all people, at least 80 percent of your assets should be in predictable investments that are out of harm's way. Once you've built a firm foundation, if you have other moneys which, if you lose, your world won't change, then you can afford to be speculative. Then, stocks and growth mutual funds may make good sense for you.
Q. What do you say to people who've seen considerable success in the stock market?
A. The stock market is not a panacea; it's a very fickle lady. We've been around long enough to know this. Tell this to people who've done well in it, and they may say, "That's great advice; let's give it to someone else." But, in my mind, it's not much different from meeting someone in a gambling casino who just won a great deal of money and telling him: "Be careful. You should stay away from this casino." If his pockets are full of money, the message isn't going to fall on fertile ears. But I'm telling you that if he continues to go, he'll give that money back and then some. We find that, when people need their money the most, that's usually when the stock market's taking it on the chin. So, if you make money with stock investments, my advice is to take most of it off the table and put it into safer vehicles.
Q. What is the appeal of zero coupon bonds?
A. You can buy them very deeply discounted. Let's say you buy $10,000 bonds for $3,000 each. Fifteen years from now, they're guaranteed for the full face value of $10,000. In the meantime, if it's a municipal bond, you don't pay any taxes. These are long-term investments, and they're ideal for financing college educations. When a child is born, a lot of grandparents buy zero coupon bonds as gifts. If they invest $30,000, for example, 18 years later, when the child is ready for college, they'll be worth $100,000. This is incredibly important, because the cost of private schools has skyrocketed. When my daughter was in college 10 years ago, I paid $60,000 for her tuition, and I thought that was astronomical. Today, that same education costs $125,000.
Q. Are conservative investors at risk of not keeping up with inflation?
A. We believe that, for the last 15 years, there's been almost no inflation. And interest rates have been declining. Not in a straight line, of course, but the trends have been lower. We don't believe inflation will be a major issue in the foreseeable future.
I think, as the economy becomes more global, competition from all over the world tends to keep prices down and put a lid on inflation. Some of the leading economists are talking about deflation. None of what's developing in the global or domestic economies looks to me like it's inflationary. In fact, it's quite the contrary.
Q. What about younger investors? Should a 35-year-old be as conservative as, say, a 55-year-old?
A. No. But by the same token, we'd still counsel him to build a strong base, have a significant amount of assets in investments where he won't have to worry about his money declining or vanishing overnight. I recommend this for people of all ages -- with no equivocation.
Q. Are people planning for retirement early enough?
A. It's very difficult for young people, given the nature of their life styles, to accumulate assets. They want two and three cars, vacations, etc. They live well, but I think many live from paycheck to paycheck.
It's hard to start planning early, yet I feel you should make every effort to. A good rule of thumb is, if you're making a dollar, live on 90 cents, and put away a dime. With personal bankruptcy and credit card delinquencies at an all-time high, I suspect a lot of people aren't doing this. But they should be.
Q. In 1993, you added real-estate investment trusts (REITs) to the list of products you market. What are they, and why do you like them?
A. They're basically companies or trusts that gather capital from investors to buy various forms of real estate, like homes, malls or offices. Investors get dividend income from the tenants who rent space in the properties. We felt that, as a result of the real estate debacle of the late 1980's and early 1990's, the market was quite ripe for REITs. We got together with a property manager in Richmond, Va., who'd spent 20 years buying and managing residential properties in the southeast. He approached me in 1992 with the concept that we could buy residential properties rather cheaply, because they were in a depressed situation, and we'd do it all for cash.
In 1993, we began the Cornerstone REIT. We added it to our product menu because we felt it had many of the same characteristics as the products we'd always favored. It was a high-income type of product with relatively little risk, and we'd list it on the stock market so it would be liquid. Today, it's worth more than $500 million and is the widest-held REIT in the world.
Q. You have a REIT in Dallas-Fort Worth. How important is location?
A. Well, we think we've hit a gold mine. The Dallas-Fort Worth area is one of the most rapidly growing areas in the country. We're buying residential apartments there for cash. So many young people are migrating into the area because of the growth of all kinds of business opportunities. It's become a premier hi-tech state, which creates ideal circumstances for a REIT.
Q. How would you advise people to create investment portfolios?
A. First, start saving money, because there's no magic formula for accumulating assets. Then, you should build up things you can depend on. There should be money in the bank and in money market accounts. As it builds, begin to buy tax-free bonds, if you're able to. REITS, which aren't leveraged, are great for young people. Mortgages are what bring real estate down, so you're giving yourself the chance to participate in the real-estate market without having to take a huge risk. The bottom line is, if you build your life around the belief that a certain stock or mutual fund is going to go crazy, you're in for a serious letdown.

HEADLINE: He Did It His Way, Or Else

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS; Sam Roberts is the deputy editor of the New York Times's Week in Review section.

 BODY:
MOSES is immortalized all over New York City -- but it's the guy who parted the Red Sea, not his namesake. He was the Moses who parted East Tremont by gouging out the Cross-Bronx Expressway and linking the suburbs with the city via bridges, expressways and parkways to deliver commuters to their promised land.
For reshaping the cityscape, all Robert Moses got were plaques on the fence of a First Avenue playground , at a plaza on the West Side campus at Fordham University and on a drab administration building on Randalls Island. 
 By 1981, when he died at age 92, few if any municipal officials had chosen to honor Moses, as his acolytes had done outside the city, by naming giant power plants and beaches and highways after him. By then, his very name had become a synonym for imperiousness. Nearly a decade earlier, Robert A. Caro's biography, "The Power Broker," monumental in its own right, had brutally punctured the Moses myth, depicting him as an arrogant genius whose ruthlessness spawned a backlash of decentralization and community vetoes that would hobble his possible successors.
Arrogant or not, Moses was a genius.
As head of a dozen city and state authorities and commissions, he wrapped New York in 627 miles of expressways and parkways, expanded its parks by 20,000 acres, built 658 playgrounds and filled in so much shoreline that its land area grew by 15,000 acres -- the equivalent of another Manhattan. He oversaw construction of public-housing projects for 555,000 people, about the same number he evicted. "I raise my stein," he wrote, "to the builder who can remove ghettos without moving people, as I hail the chef who can make omelets without breaking eggs."
MOSES began his rise by insinuating himself with Gov. Al Smith as a young idealist; he then parlayed his power by generously dispensing legal graft. Before Moses was even old enough to vote, Andrew H. Green, the father of New York's consolidation, had united disparate cities and towns into the critical mass that would make it Greater New York. Other visionaries invested in a subway system, which forged a single city from Green's blueprint. But, more than any other person, Moses shaped the city's physical face, and much of its social destiny, for very nearly half the 100 years that it rose and stumbled and rose again.
Would the city have been better off without him? Even Mr. Caro wrote that "Robert Moses may have bent the democratic processes of the city to his own ends to build public works; left to themselves, these processes proved unequal to the building required." Moses and the expansionist era he typified are easier to judge in hindsight. Headlines nowadays resonate with the unresolved conflicts that he personified: between urban development and democracy and between mass transit and motorists.
Moses' distrust of democracy might have been rooted in personal experience (he offered himself for mayor in 1933 and governor in 1934 and was soundly rejected), but he insisted that most people benefited from his public projects. He never lost the illusion that if New Yorkers knew what good was, they would embrace his brand of benevolent despotism.
Moses' favorite aphorism was, "If the ends don't justify the means, what does?"
He would be remembered for both.

HEADLINE: In the Region/Long Island;
8 New Start-Up Incubators for Business Proposed

BYLINE: By DIANA SHAMAN 

 BODY:
SINCE its purchase in 1996 of a 240,000-square-foot office building in Bethpage from Northrop Grumman, Briarcliffe College has refurbished half the structure for its academic needs and leased out 104,000 square feet to others.
But Briarcliffe's Board of Trustees also has another enterprise in mind. With the nonprofit Briarcliffe Foundation as the sponsor it hopes to turn the remaining 22,000 square feet on the building's second floor into an "incubator" to nurture start-up companies involved with software development. 
 Two companies, Valid Data, which develops software for the furniture industry, and Current Legal Resources, which collects and publishes legal information, have moved into a total of 2,000 square feet. But the incubator is not yet in operation since more than $500,000 is needed to divide the space for an anticipated total of up to 19 companies and provide high-speed data lines and other services.
"We feel that the computer software industry should be supported and what we are hoping to do is develop companies that eventually will provide work opportunities for all Long Island," said Richard B. Turan, president of the college, which specializes in business and technology.
New York State has 38 incubators, but only one -- the Long Island High Technology Incubator on the campus of the State University of New York at Stony Brook -- is on Long Island. Now there are proposals under way to add eight including the one at Briarcliffe. The proposals depend on the availability of public funds to help with construction, but thereafter incubators would be self-sustaining, according to their proponents.
A pilot program has been started at another of the proposed locations, the State University of New York at Farmingdale. The nonprofit Long Island Forum for Technology now has a 6,000-square-foot incubator there, but is working with the university and others on the design of an incubator with as much as 40,000 square feet of space.
"You need incubators to support companies in their formative stages, otherwise the companies go elsewhere," said Peter S. Goldsmith, director of economic development for the Long Island Association in Commack.
The business group started a program called Project Long Island three years ago to keep high technology manufacturing jobs in the region following job losses in military contracts.
The electronics, printing, medical imaging and health information systems, biotechnology and computer software industries are key to providing those jobs and must be nurtured, Mr. Goldsmith said.
Business incubators are becoming increasingly popular economic development tools throughout the country, growing from only 12 such programs as recently as 1980, to almost 600 today. In addition to providing inexpensive space, their value lies in giving start-up companies access to other ongoing research because they are usually situated in an academic setting.
A RECENTLY completed study conducted by the University of Michigan, the National Business Incubation Association and Ohio University in Athens and the Southern Technology Council in Research Triangle Park in North Carolina found that entrepreneurial companies that graduate from incubators have an 87 percent survival rate and that 84 percent remain in their communities. In 1996, such companies created an average of 468 direct jobs and 234 spinoff jobs.
"I am a firm believer in the ability of incubators to support a spawning stream of high technology, particularly on Long Island," said James Hayward, co-chairman of the Long Island Regional Incubator Task Force. The group was formed two years ago by Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, the state's economic development and job creation agency.
The purpose of the task force, whose other chairman is Thomas F. Gallagher, is to assess the need for incubators on Long Island and recommend ways to implement them. Dr. Hayward is president of the Collaborative Group of East Setauket, a biotechnology company. Mr. Gallagher is the director of manufacturing business development for Empire State.
The task force received 27 incubator proposals. It combined them into eight, "ruling out none," Dr.Hayward said. "The eight could provide in excess of 10,000 new jobs over the course of a decade," he added.
In addition to Briarcliffe and Farmingdale, proposed sites include North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, Dowling College in Oakdale, Freeport, Calverton and additional space at SUNY Stony Brook. The task force is recommending a five-year program involving both new construction and adaptations of space in existing buildings.
The projected cost of the eight proposals would be $95.4 million of which New York State's share would be $30 million, according to a letter supporting the incubator proposals that was sent to Gov. George E. Pataki by 19 of 22 of Long Island's Assembly membersmen. The remaining cost would be paid out of Federal matching grants and private loans and investment.
Computer Associates International of Islandia, another leading software company, already announced earlier this month that it would help finance a separate 6,000-square-foot software incubator at the Stony Brook campus, with the university also picking up some of the cost. Computer Associates will contribute several hundred thousand dollars over three years, said Marc S. Sokol, the company's senior vice president of advanced technology.
Stony Brook's existing incubator has attracted mainly biotechnology companies."There is enough biomedical research being done between New York City and Long Island to generate enough technology to spawn hundreds of new companies," said Francis P. Hession, the president and managing director of the incubator.
"Unfortunately, there has been a tremendous loss of both brainpower and economic viability as these companies go elsewhere," he said. "But by having incubators as a structured way to transfer technology to private industry, we can attract venture capital, which now goes from New York to California."
SUNY at Stony Brook had housed start-up companies in various campus buildings until 1992 when the state provided a $1.2 million grant to build the 42,000-square-foot incubator. The building offers both office and laboratory space along with support services. Loans, which provided the remaining $5.9 million needed for construction, are being paid off out of rents paid by its 30 tenants.
IN 1994, 30,000 square feet more were added with the help of a $3.6 million state grant. The incubator has already graduated 20 companies that now employ 900 people and generate $75 million in revenues annually, Mr. Hession said.
One graduate is Dr. Hayward's company, the Collaborative Group, which among other ventures is the world's largest manufacturer of liposomes -- artificial structures similar to a human cell that are used in gene therapy and in cosmetics and in skin care.
The company, started in 1990, has grown from 500 square feet it occupied at the Stony Brook incubator into a 150,000-square-foot enterprise employing 200 people.
One of its four subsidiaries, Collaborative BioAlliance, operates a 30,000-square-foot contract research and contract manufacturing complex at the Stony Brook incubator, where it is the anchor tenant. The facility, which has Food and Drug Administration approval, makes it possible for biotechnology companies to bring products to clinical trials without making a major investment in their own plants and equipment.
Merrill Garnett, a cancer researcher since 1959, has worked for the last five years in a 500-square-foot laboratory at the Stony Brook incubator. His company, Garnett McKeen Lab, will submit its new oral chemotherapy to clinical trials this spring. Dr. Garnett, the primary inventor of the chemotherapy agent, called Palladium Complex, developed it for the treatment of brain tumors, lymphoma, lung and kidney cancers and a variety of other tumors. It also benefits patients when used in conjunction with other chemotherapy treatments, he said. So-called compassionate trials conducted in Canada and Mexico on patients with glioblastoma, a lethal brain tumor, brought about long-lasting improvement on some advanced cases within days, Dr. Garnett said.
Other advances growing out of Stony Brook include a device resembling a series of pressure cuffs that is used for a painless, noninvasive treatment of angina pectoris -- a chest pain caused by coronary artery disease. The device, applied to the lower extremities, reduces angina by using a technology called enhanced external counterpulsation to increase coronary artery blood flow. The device is marketed by Vasomedical, a Westbury company, to medical centers around the world.
Patients are treated an hour a day for a total of 35 days over seven weeks. John C. K. Hui and Harry S. Soroff brought the device, which was refined in China, to Stony Brook in 1989 for its first clinical trials.

HEADLINE: On Staten Island, a Buried Treasure

BYLINE: By FRANK McCOURT; Frank McCourt is the author of "Angela's Ashes" (Scribner).

 BODY:
THE school page of The New York World-Telegram and Sun carried lists of jobs available for teachers around the city. In March 1958, there was a vacancy for an English teacher at McKee Vocational and Technical High School, St. Mark's Place and Wall Street. There was a phone number and when I called, a lady said, "Come right over." I lived, then, near Borough Hall in Brooklyn, and I was pleased at how convenient it would be to travel such a short distance to my first teaching job.
I wandered up and down Wall Street looking for the school. No one had ever heard of it. A police officer shook his head. "Nah, no schools on Wall Street." 
 "What about St. Mark's Place?"
"There's no St. Mark's Place around here."
"But it's right here in the paper."
"I don't care what's in the paper. This is my beat."
I called the number again. (In those days there were no area codes in the city.) When I told the lady her school didn't exist in the Wall Street area, she sighed: "We have that trouble all the time. You gotta take the ferry to St. George and walk up the hill. You can't miss McKee. You'll see kids."
"Where is St. George?"
The sigh now was impatient. "Staten Island! Staten Island!"
The ferry fare was a nickel and it took a half-hour to cross the harbor to St. George. It was not a straight, clear run. The bay was alive with vessels: liners, freighters, tankers, barges, tugboats, other ferries to Governors Island, the Statue of Liberty, New Jersey. The Manhattan skyline was seductive but then lacked the World Trade Center and the buildings that later sprang up throughout the island.
The view out along the Narrows was open: the Verrazano bridge had not yet been built. Ellis Island was a desolation. It saddened me to see an abandoned ferry sinking in the water. My father might have stood on the deck of that ferry, excited, as I was, over the city's towers.
At St. George, I climbed the hill to McKee Vocational and Technical High School and the lady was right: there were kids -- hundreds of them swarming outside the school. Some cruised by in convertibles, and when they approached the school, revved up and roared away to the cheers of their friends. It was a scene from an early 50's, teen-age gang movie, and I felt trapped. I had never been able to deal with these alien creatures -- the boys with their duck-tail haircuts, girls with their hair piled up beehive style. I could walk away now, back down the hill to the ferry. After all, friends had told me: "Don't go near vocational high schools. The kids there will kill you."
No. I'd try it. How could I pass up that daily ferry ride, that skyline, that great sweep of harbor, the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island -- a daily reminder of the thousands who had passed through?
The assistant principal, Miss Seested, checked my teaching license and took me to the office of the principal, Moses Sorola. He grunted when I told him I had no teaching experience, and he wanted to know why I talked like that. "What is this accent?"
"Irish."
"Oh."
He said he really didn't have a complete English program for me, that I would have three classes in a social-studies course, "Economic Citizenship," and two sophomore classes in English, and could I handle that? I said I knew nothing about "Economic Citizenship," and he said there was a textbook, just stay a few pages ahead of the kids. The textbook was "Your World and You," and he smiled and said that should cover just about everything. He took me to the teacher I was replacing, Miss Mudd, who sat at her desk ignoring the bedlam in her classroom. Bits of chalk flew through the air, blackboard erasers, scraps of sandwiches. Boys leaned out the windows, calling to girls across the yard.
But when Mr. Sorola appeared, everything stopped. He called two boys to the front of the room, told me that Miss Mudd would tell me everything I needed to know and marched the boys to his office. Miss Mudd hardly looked at me, bleated that she was swamped with paper work, that these kids were driving her crazy, that I would be crazy, too, after 32 years in a vocational high school, that if I looked out the window next week I would see an ocean liner sailing by with her waving goodbye and that when she returned from her retirement cruise, there were two things she never wanted to see again in her life: kids and Staten Island.
Her end was my beginning -- and nearly my end. In Room 104 that last week in March 1958, I struggled with five classes of students from various shops: auto mechanics, sheet metal, printing, machine shop, woodworking, cosmetology.
THEY didn't want to sit in English classes. Why couldn't they watch movies instead of reading these stupid books, "Giants in the Earth" and "Silas Marner"? Why did they have to read about people all gloomy on the prairie or about a dirty old man in England? The "Economic Citizenship" kids didn't want to know about the stock market. They wanted to know if I was sorry James Dean was dead. I shook my head: I didn't know. Didn't I think Elvis was the greatest singer the world had ever seen? I preferred Bing Crosby. They frowned. They threw chalk and sandwiches at one another. I was losing them.
I was saved by Miss Mudd. She had left closets packed with old grammar textbooks, newspapers, Regents exams and hundreds of pages of uncorrected student compositions going back to 1942. The boys yearned to fight, to avenge the deaths of brothers, friends, neighbors. ("I'm gonna kill five Japs for every one they killed from my neighborhood.") And the girls would wait. ("When Joey comes home, we're gonna get married and move to Jersey and get away from his crazy mother.")
I piled the crumbling compositions on my desk and began reading some to my classes. They sat up. There were familiar names. "Hey, that was my father. He was wounded in Africa." "That was my uncle. Killed in Guam." There were tears: strong, young men ran suddenly to the toilets and returned red-eyed. The girls wept openly and consoled one another.
We worried that these brittle papers would fall apart and, since there were no sophisticated duplicating machines in the school, we agreed that we would have to copy the old papers by hand.
Mr. Sorola looked in a few times and said nothing: I think he was grateful for a quiet classroom. We continued after the Easter break and when exam time rolled around in June, I passed everyone.
The teacher had learned more than anyone in that classroom on Staten Island.

HEADLINE: The Ultimate Takeover

BYLINE: By RON CHERNOW; Ron Chernow is the author of "The House of Morgan" (Touchstone) and "The Warburgs" (Vintage). His biography of John D. Rockefeller Sr. is to be published in May by Random House.

 BODY:
SHORTLY after noon on Oct. 19, 1987, as the giant plunge on Wall Street gathered force, I boarded the downtown Seventh Avenue IRT in search of high drama. Newly embarked on "The House of Morgan," I wanted to stand at the corner of Broad and Wall Streets and savor the full thrill of financial disaster. My mind teemed with grainy black-and-white images of ashen-faced investors thronging the sidewalks during the 1907 panic and the 1929 crash. Yet when I emerged from the subway that day, I found, to my great dismay, no ranks of grim, ruined speculators, no stockbrokers sailing from upper-story windows. The famous corner, if not quite as calm as a country crossroads, gave no hint that $500 billion of shareholder value was being erased behind the Corinthian columns of the New York Stock Exchange.
Though I felt robbed of a certain voyeuristic titillation -- I read once that messengers, unlike their bosses, had found the 1929 crash exhilarating -- I realized that the empty, placid street disclosed a larger truth. A century ago, Wall Street denoted a specific piece of real estate in lower Manhattan, plus an industry crowded within its borders. Nowadays, Wall Street is a free-floating state of mind, an electronic universe enlisting the avid attention of tens of millions of small investors. Where the old Wall Street had been aloof and aristocratic, snob heaven, the new Wall Street, with its computer screens, discount brokers and trading on the Internet, is as blandly democratic as a shopping mall. 
 Back in 1898, Wall Street was the preserve of high finance, catering to governments, corporations and rich individuals. Denizens of the Street spent a lifetime avoiding contact with unfortunate mortals worth less than seven figures. Because it harbored the nation's creditor class, the financial district inevitability bred mistrust in a small-town, agrarian America populated by millions of debtors. It seemed poetically apt that Wall Street occupied the tip of an island, overlooking a great port. Closeness to the sea was the very essence of this cosmopolitan place.
Thriving on its overseas connections, Wall Street channeled capital from abroad to American railways and industry and embodied a truth unpalatable to most Americans: a proudly isolationist republic, conceived in a struggle against European despotism, still relied on foreigners for money.
The portly, top-hatted bankers in lower Manhattan reflected the values of those distant creditors, especially their preference for hard currency, low inflation and fiscal discipline. Not surprisingly, they often seemed spoilsports in an America yearning for cheap money and rip-roaring growth.
A century ago, Main Street dreaded Wall Street for another reason. As thousands of regional companies were amalgamated into national trusts, New York bankers engineered many of the deals. To a worried Main Street, it seemed that Wall Street was stealing its local companies. Small-town banks, with limited capital, were hopelessly inadequate before the scale of the emerging new economy; only Manhattan bankers had the large capital pools to effect these mergers. As a result, the new monopolies were often based in Manhattan, their boards stuffed with fancy bankers and lawyers. The Wall Street tycoons were instrumental in making New York a managerial city, the nation's business address.
AS THE 20th century progressed, Wall Street banks grew larger as they tried to keep pace with their expanding multinational clients. But the bankers themselves grew smaller and less lordly, trapped in large conglomerates and overshadowed by their corporate customers.
After World War II, real estate on Wall Street stagnated as many investment houses migrated to midtown, humbly trailing these clients. Why this sudden demotion in power? As large companies raised money directly from stock and bond markets, turned to foreign bankers or developed their own financial subsidiaries, the Street surrendered its historic monopoly on capital, knowledge and expertise.
Deserted by their blue-chip clients, Wall Street has submitted in recent years to the ultimate indignity: it has embraced Main Street as its salvation. The most blue-blooded houses are scrambling to buy retail brokers, forge links with mutual fund groups or manage 401(k) plans for middle-income investors. They have traded the discretion of deal makers for the robust salesmanship of asset managers. Power in the financial world now flows from the bottom up, not the top down. In the 1920's, when only 1.5 million Americans played the stock market, Wall Street thought it unseemly to recognize them. Now that more than 60 million Americans own mutual funds, Wall Street has developed profound esteem for the small investor. In the process, it has sacrificed its proud heritage as a conspiracy against the public, becoming instead the nerve center for a national brokerage network.
The revolution has been two-sided; small investors in the heartland -- once the seedbed of populism -- now find wisdom in the pronouncements of Wall Street financiers. They accept stock-market pundits, brokerage house analysts and billionaire investors as oracles on topical issues and role models in daily life. With the current vogue for stock investing, the distinctive psychology of the creditor permeates American politics and culture. Ordinary citizens fret about inflation, worry about excess growth and betray a touching concern for corporate earnings. Once poised on the rim of the continent, like an enemy beachhead, Wall Street has marched across the country and occupied it from coast to coast. It has stooped to conquer the American masses, and the conquest has been all but complete.

HEADLINE: Disabled, He Helps Others Beat Handicaps

BYLINE: By MARCELLE S. FISCHLER

 BODY:
THE real issue for people with disabilities is their abilities. In an ideal world, people with disabilities will live simply as people, with the same opportunities as everyone else.
Making their abilities, not their disabilities, count, has been a lifelong mission for 85-year-old Henry Viscardi Jr. Born without legs, he spent the first six years of his life as a charity patient in a hospital ward for crippled children. An adviser to presidents, author of eight books and holder of 23 honorary doctorates, this Long Island legend founded the internationally recognized National Center for Disability Services, a multi-faceted, state-of-the art-educational training and research institution in Albertson. 
 The center is the fruition of Abilities Inc., a venture Dr. Viscardi started 45 years ago out of a West Hempstead garage with eight handicapped adults -- legless, armless, blind and paralyzed -- who were considered unemployable by traditional standards. Ten years later, Abilities, a competitive not-for-profit enterprise, had 475 employees building electronic components.
"It survived 30 years, but as the economy on Long Island changed we began to see we had new and greater responsibilities in our school, adult training program and research," Dr. Viscardi said. "The opposition didn't really change."
In 1962, he founded the Human Resources School, which was renamed in his honor six years ago, educating severely disabled children who otherwise would have to study at home or from a hospital bed. The Henry Viscardi School has 220 pupils in pre-kindergarten through high school, 40 percent of whom come from New York City. Others commute from Westchester and Rockland Counties.
While Dr. Viscardi retired as chief executive officer in 1981, it was his vision that enabled the center to be a model program. New technologies, long-distance learning capabilities and a website are allowing the trendsetting work there to be shared with the disabled all over the globe.
Educating and training thousands of people with disabilities, and inspiring them to lead active, fulfilling lives, Dr. Viscardi's work continues to have an impact on the lives of Long Islanders and their families. Last year, almost 300 people with disabilities were placed into employment on Long Island and an additional 327 found employment elsewhere with the center's help.
Last November, the center received $6.6 million in Federal grants for programs that will train and find jobs for more than 5,200 people with disabilities in eight states, including New York, over the next five years. The school is mostly financed by the state.
"Continuing to serve this cause as long as I can is the fulfillment of what I consider to be my destiny," said Dr. Viscardi, who was fitted with artificial limbs at age 27. "We changed thousands of lives.I think it's a better world now than when it began. Far more disabled people are given the opportunity to be educated and to work."
Dr. Viscardi and his wife, Lucile, have lived their married life of 52 years in a converted garage overlooking the Sound in Kings Point. The Viscardis have four daughters, nine grandchildren and became great-grandparents of twins last week.
During World War II, as part of the Red Cross, he worked with amputees at Walter Reed Hospital in Washington. He helped pay part of his way through college by refereeing basketball games on his stumps, standing three feet, eight inches high in orthopedic boots. He attended law school and worked as a tax auditor, in broadcasting and as personnel director of a large corporation before taking on JOB, Just One Break, a project finding jobs for rehabilitated men and women.
Dr. Viscardi, an avid sailor whose office at the seven-acre complex on Searingtown Road is a museum of photographs, mementos and diplomas chronicling his life's work, still swims with the children at the school's specially-equipped indoor pool every day. The campus includes an independent learning house for senior high school students to practice living on their own and preparing their own meals before graduation.
"We keep saying to these kids, "There's a place for you out in that world. It's not going to come easy. You have to sacrifice and work hard. Prepare yourselves. Be prepared for rejection,' " said Dr. Viscardi, who continues to give lectures and presentations.
Videoconferencing capabilities, a fully accessible television studio and conference area in the adjacent 7,560-square-foot Smeal Learning Center, which opened in September, allows the center to share its research and training techniques with universities and other institutions. The learning center, built on Abilities' former site, was conceptualized by Dr. Viscardi in 1952. The campus also includes St. Charles Hospital at the Dolan Rehabilitation Center, which provides medical rehabilitation services including physical, occupational and speech therapies, neuropsychological evaluations and counseling services.
"The center originally started as a place that was attempting to help people with disabilities get out of situations in which they were either isolated at home, or children who should have been in school were being kept at home because the education system wasn't working for them," said Edmund L. Cortez, president and chief executive officer of the national center. "People who should have had jobs weren't working and were staying at home because employment opportunities didn't exist for them. The center created a kind of isolated haven for these individuals to go to school and get training to go to work with the eventual goal that these individuals would would become integrated within the community."
Dr. Viscardi's program was created to prove that people with disabilities could work like everybody else at a time when institutions and separate schools were being built to isolate the handicapped.
"It was Hank Viscardi who said, 'But I can demonstrate that these people can work, can compete, can be part of the mainstream,' " Mr. Cortez said. "Throughout our history we have been committed to that original idea, that people with disabilities are simply people like everybody else. They have the same ambitions, the same dreams, the same feelings as everybody else. And on top of that they are people that we know personally. People with disabilities are our parents and our children and our friends. If a person, because they're getting older and can't walk as well as they used to, or hear as well as they used to or can't hold things as well as they used to because of arthritis, those are disabilities."
In most ways, the Viscardi school is an educational institution like any other. Children chatter noisily in the cafeteria at lunchtime. Down the hall in a second-grade classroom, youngsters are studying the forests and working on their writing skills. Kindergartners play at the sand table in their classroom. The children have art, music, gym and computer. There is a black rabbit named Cocoa in the preschool classroom.
But there are standers stacked in the hallways, wooden boards for children who need the opportunity to be in upright positions during the day, a large red buggy to transport six nonambulatory preschoolers through the hallways and a wheelchair accessible playground outside the kindergarten door.
In the $600,000 technology suite, which was built with private donor funds and opened in October, 24 computer stations adapt to individual needs. Desk tops and monitors adjust to accommodate different-sized wheelchairs at the input of a special code, specialty keyboards come split in sections, tilt in any direction for a youngster with very short arms and come in smaller sizes to accommodate students without a large range of motion. There are trackballs instead of mice, pressure-sensitive keyboards and one designed for a student who manipulates it with his feet.
"In a lot of ways we are like every other school," said Dr. Ellen Bergman, superintendent of the school. "Same types of books, same types of posters. We run readings, participation events." It is technology, she said, that has made a tremendous difference.
"Technology enables them to compete in the world on a level playing field," she said. "Thanks to assistive technology, equipment that makes access to computers available to almost all of us and the actual use of technology, which allows you to travel the world without ever leaving your actual environment, our students for the first time are able to adapt to the demands of society and compensate for their disabilities on a very even playing field. They can use their intelligence, their talents, their creativity and it is quite remarkable, all thanks to technology."
Children in the Viscardi school primarily have physical or medically related disabilities, such as cerebral palsy that leaves them little control over their muscles. Many have been in car accidents or broken their necks jumping into swimming pools. Six children at the center must use ventilators because of spinal cord injuries and have no control of anything below their necks, yet attend class and learn with their ventilator systems strapped to their wheelchairs. Many of the children with degenerative diseases need regular medical care through the day.
Eight-year-old Brandon Wolfbiss of Syosset, who has severe cerebral palsy, takes second-grade spelling and math tests with his eyes, using special visual boards, and practices navigating a power wheelchair operated with a chin switch down the school's long corridors.
Alan Muir, a vice president at Chase Bank's Long Island headquarters in Melville, graduated from the school as valedictorian in 1978. A dwarf who has some difficulty walking because of congenital hip and back deformities, he played hockey, baseball and football and was team manager at the then Human Resources School, none of which would have been possible in a public high school.
"The overall atmosphere gave you a better sense of yourself and self confidence," said Mr. Muir. He followed the Regents curriculum and went on to Adelphi University. "Dr. Viscardi is probably one of the most genuinely compassionate and passionate people that I have ever met," Mr. Muir said. "He is very determined, very upfront about a lot of situations. He tells you exactly what the situation is. He doesn't sugarcoat anything."
Adults in the vocational rehabilitation program, most of whom come from Nassau and Suffolk Counties, have disabilities that interfere with their ability to work.
"We will have people with developmental delays, emotional disabilities, an inability to cope with stress, depression, those kinds of issues to the extent where it keeps the person from keeping a job," Mr. Cortez said. "We train them to cope with some of those issues and at the same time to work despite those disabilities."
The center's National Business and Disability Council program is designed to provide support to employers so they understand what they need to do to hire and effectively employ people with disabilities. The employment program offers training for laboratory assistants and in basic accounting skills, word processing, filing and retail skills.
"We try to pave the way for them so that they can hire that person," Mr. Cortez said. "Once that person is hired, we try to help them make reasonable accommodations in a cost-effective manner. Very often, the employer thinks he has to spend thousands of dollars to accommodate this environment. Often the answer is you don't have to spend very much money at all. There are some very easy solutions if you just understand how to approach the problem."
Despite the lowest unemployment rate in 28 years, Mr. Cortez said that close to 70 percent of people with disabilities of working age who wanted to work and had the capability of working did not have jobs. Eighty-five percent of the people who go to the center's training program get jobs, he said.
"That's an extraordinary record," Mr. Cortez said. "It's unique. If you go to most training programs, you won't find statistics like that. What we're talking about is isolated to Long Island and to the places where we have programs. There are 49 million people with disabilities in this country. We're just touching not even the tip of the iceberg. Employers are hiring unqualified people to fill jobs because they can't find qualified people. Yet there's this pool of millions of people with disabilities who are looking for work who can't get jobs. What we need to do is figure out how to put the two together. They're looking for each other. They just can't find each other.".
Despite the center's technological savvy, Dr. Viscardi is personally glad the computer age has passed him by. He doesn't even have a telephone answering machine at home.
"The computer age is pushing the horizons of total helplessness further and further back," Dr. Viscardi said. "With the computer, you have so much potential to close the gap between the capacities of the individual and the demands of the job to be done. We're physically disabled because the doctors can define that. When it comes to occupational disability, as long as our physical capacities can meet the demands of the job to be done, we are not occupationally disabled. Both can be changed. I'm one thing without my artificial limbs. I'm quite another with them."

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Paul Griffiths's article "Callas Sings Bob Dylan? Could Be" Jan. 11 overlooked two important companion technologies to the recording of classical music. The first is television and videocassettes. The VCR has become almost as ubiquitous as the television set. As consumers upgrade the quality of their "home theater" equipment, these technologies come remarkably close to a live performance. 
 I disagree with Mr. Griffiths's assertion that seeing is unnecessary and a redundant part of classical-music enjoyment. Seeing has to be one of the reasons people go to a live performance of a symphony orchestra. Television and videocassettes offer this opportunity to virtually all Americans at economical prices, even if their local areas do not have live performances.
The second technology is video distribution, with its enormous expansion of channels through cable and satellites, which is increased even more by bandwidth compression. It is only a matter of time until more of these channels will be used for niche audiences rather than movies. Classical music is a natural for this new opportunity. Ovation Channel is trying to do just this for all the arts.
The future of technology and classical music is indeed bright, even if fundamental audio recording and editing are going in the wrong direction with their ability to create artificial perfection and maybe even deception as Mr. Griffiths seems to suggest.

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/Kent, N.Y.;
Rustic, Rugged Yet A Workable Commute

BYLINE: By LISA PREVOST 

 BODY:
WHEN Anne Ladau talks about the Town of Kent in northern Putnam County, she often jokingly refers to it as "L. L. Bean country."
"You know, warm fires and wet dogs -- perfect for a log cabin or a chalet," said Ms. Ladau, an associate broker with Houlihan/ Lawrence. 
 Indeed, a trip up the Taconic State Parkway through the town's rugged northwestern edge, which hooks around the northern tip of the rugged terrain of Clarence Fahnestock Memorial State Park, confirms that assessment. Elsewhere in Kent, thousands of acres of preservation land and more than a dozen pristine lakes and ponds give residents the illusion of living upstate, though they are only about 65 miles from New York City.
While several recreation-oriented developments have grown up around golf clubs and lakes here, Kent does not have the feel of an upscale resort area. Most homeowners are year-round residents, many in modest ranches or Cape Cods clustered near lakes. And because it is accessible by both the Taconic and Interstates 684 and 84, Kent is becoming increasingly attractive to commuters looking for rural surroundings at affordable prices.
Carol Luiken, a costume designer, said she can make it to New York City from her house in western Kent in an hour. That was one of the criteria she laid down when she and her husband, Charles Clute, a personal-fitness trainer, set out to buy a house in 1984. They wanted a historic home, but thought Westchester County was too expensive. They found their ideal right off the Taconic -- a 200-year-old refinished barn with big, exposed beams inside and "breathtaking" surroundings.
"We just have an acre of land, but it seems like we have forever," Ms. Luiken said. "We're just about on the corner of Fahnestock."
The town has no main street -- Route 52 serves as the main business road, where shopping includes such basics a small grocery, a drugstore and a hardware store. The nearest shopping hub is the huge Danbury Fair complex, a 10- to 15-minute drive away in Danbury, Conn. But Ms. Luiken said she's learned to adjust: "I go to Sam's Club and buy enough toilet paper for a year."
The town is often considered part of Carmel and the confusion is understandable. Until recently, addresses in Kent were lumped in with Carmel -- there are two Kents in New York State, so this Kent had to use the Carmel zip code and post office. About a year ago, Kent got its own postal designation as Kent Lakes, but the town still shares Carmel's post office and zip code.
BUT Kent may soon establish a name for itself as a regional shopping destination. F.A.C. Realty Trust, of Cary, N.C, has proposed a 450,000-square-foot factory outlet center on 100 acres just off Interstate 84 where it crosses Route 311 at Exit 18. If the developer obtains the necessary approvals, construction will begin in early spring, said Edward Heelan, owner of Heelan Realty and Development in Brewster, the broker for the project.
"There's no question the revenue is needed, said Joseph L. Belvedere, who recently concluded eight years as Town Supervisor. "As it is now, we penny-pinch -- we have to," he said. The property tax rate in Kent went up 35 cents to about $7.19 per $1,000 this year, the first increase in almost three years.
But "future development in Kent is environmentally limited," said Matthew D. Rudikoff, the Town Planner. One natural limitation is its steep, rocky terrain, which makes large-scale subdivisions a near impossibility. Kent issued an average of just 16 residential building permits annually from 1991 through 1996. Moreover, the town is almost entirely within the New York City watershed, which is regulated by the city's Department of Environmental Protection.
The city already owns 840 acres in Kent, but through the D.E.P.'s new Land Acquisition and Stewardship Program, they are now offering landowners fair-market value for vacant land to protect it from development. So far, landowners in Kent have contracted to sell an additional 2,266 acres to the city, according to Dave Tobias, the program director.
 NEW YORK CITY'S claim to Putnam County water -- there are 11 city reservoirs in the county, 2 of them in Kent -- dates back to the 1860's, when the city began acquiring land for the Croton Aqueduct Water Works and built the 70-foot-tall Boyd's Dam in Kent on the Croton River. The clear and plentiful water that was so valuable to parched city dwellers was also the economic lifeblood of a thriving mill community in Kent.
The settlement, called Farmers Mills, was strung along a small stream at the outlet of White Pond. It produced flour, wood, leather, barrel hoops, wool, charcoal and dairy products for surrounding towns. At one time, said Richard Muscarella, the county historian, some 500 families lived there.
But when the Harlem and the Hudson Railroads came through in the mid-19th century, Mr. Muscarella said, the population center moved south to the Village of Brewster, cutting off Farmers Mills from the new paths of commerce. Though little remains of the settlement, its history is depicted in a diorama in front of a one-room schoolhouse on Farmers Mills Road.
Farmers Mills was one of the earliest settlements in Kent, which was known as Frederick until 1817 when it was renamed for a family of prominent settlers. Another one-time mill community is the hamlet of Ludingtonville, once the home of Sybil Ludington, a Revolutionary War heroine. On the night of April 26, 1777, the 16-year-old Miss Ludington, the daughter of Col. Henry Ludington, rode 40 miles through the countryside to alert militiamen that the British were burning Danbury. A statue commemorating her ride stands in Carmel on the shore of Lake Gleneida.
By the turn of the century, Kent began to receive an influx of wealthy vacationers from the city. Country clubs and camps, some complete with manmade lakes, sprang up to meet the demand. One of the earliest of these was Hill and Dale Country Club, constructed in 1928 with a private lake and 18-hole golf course.
Most of the homes in this private community are now occupied year-round; prices range from $165,000 a 2-bedroom ranch to $265,000 for a 3-bedroom log chalet. Up the road are two town-house condominium complexes, one of which, the 116-unit Sparrow Ridge, is still under construction. Prices there start at about $152,000 for a 2-bedroom unit. A 2-bedroom town house at the 100-unit Fairways complex was recently listed at a resale price of $180,000.
Development is most dense around Lake Carmel, a manmade lake created in the early 30's as part of a low-priced housing development marketed to blue-collar workers. The Cape Cods and raised ranches set closely together on small lots around the lake range in price from about $130,000 to $160,000.
The few dozen ranches and raised ranches in Kentwood Lake Estates, built in the 70's, tend to sell for slightly more. The houses are on half-acre lots near a lake with a sandy beach and walking trails.
Between such developments, the woods can stretch for several miles without interruption. Then a few houses might appear, set back in the trees or high on a ledge. There are relatively few historic homes in Kent, but a little bit of everything else.
Vacation homes tend to be in the Sedgewood Club, Gipsy Trail Club and Lake Sagamore areas. Homes in Sedgewood, a golf club also established in the 1920's where Itzhak Perlman, the concert violinist, once owned a residence, can cost close to $1 million for a spacious log and stone lakefront retreat. The Gipsy Trail Club caters to active families -- the mandatory club membership provides access to swimming, sailing, tennis, horseback riding and dining. Lake Sagamore, once the site of a Wappinger Indian village, offers properties with beautiful lakefront views, but the "oldish ranches" often require some remodeling, said Ms. Ladau, the broker. Second-home prices in Kent average between $300,000 and $400,000, she said.
KENT is part of the Carmel Central School District. Children attend elementary school in Kent through the fourth grade, then attend middle school and high school in Carmel. The music program in the Carmel schools is "one of the most extensive in the area," said Dr. Thomas P. Higgins Jr., the schools superintendent, who noted that almost 90 percent of the students in fifth grade were "involved in some way in music."
Carmel High School offers 11 advanced placement courses. S.A.T. averages for 1997 were 519 in verbal and 507 in math; the state averages for the same period were 495 in verbal and 502 in math. Mr. Higgins said that over the last two years 85 percent of the graduating classes went on to higher education.
 The Roman Catholic St. James the Apostle school in Carmel offers a full-day kindergarten program and classes through the eighth grade. Annual tuition is $1,490, with a $250 surcharge for kindergarten students, said the principal, Daisy Abruzzo.
Recreational opportunities abound at the many state and county-owned parks in Kent. Fahnestock Park, which covers 6,800 acres, entices fishermen to its three ponds and two lakes. A nature center offers various family-oriented activities during the summer. The 1,000-acre Ninham Mountain State Forest, named for a Wappinger sachem who fought in both the French and Indian and Revolutionary Wars, offers fishing, hiking, camping, cross-country skiing and hunting.

HEADLINE: Knick Player Reaches for More Time on Court

BYLINE: By DAN MARKOWITZ 

 BODY:
WHEN Chris Dudley, the New York Knick center and Rye resident, turned down a four-year, $13 million deal with the Detroit Pistons to play for the Knicks for $272,000, the league minimum, he expected to receive regular playing time on a championship-caliber team. Instead, Patrick Ewing's season-ending wrist injury actually decreased Dudley's playing time, and although the Knicks have played well during Ewing's absence, making the playoffs and possibly winning one round is a more realistic Knick goal than a championship. 
 But Dudley, who will turn 33 next month, is no stranger to adversity. This season, he has already suffered through a bout with the flu, a strained lower back and a broken nose. When he was 16, he was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. The 6-foot-11 Dudley remembers asking his father, "Will I still be able to play basketball?" He could, but as a Division 1 recruit, Dudley chose Yale, not a basketball titan, from which his father, uncle and grandfather, Guilford Dudley, who served as Ambassador to Denmark, all graduated.
It was not until the summer after his sophomore season at Yale, while working as a counselor at Dean Smith's basketball camp at the University of North Carolina, where he played pick-up games against all the former Carolina players-turned-pro, that Dudley thought he had pro potential. When he graduated from Yale with a degree in economics, Dudley was the 75th pick in the 1987 National Basketball Association draft.
Now he is entering his 12th season in the N.B.A. The Knicks are his fourth team after stints in Cleveland, New Jersey and Portland. Dudley, along with Matt Maloney of the Houston Rockets and formerly of the University of Pennsylvania, is the only Ivy League graduate playing in the N.B.A. The league tried to block the Knicks' acquiring Dudley this summer and signing him for a one-year deal at far less than his market value. N.B.A. lawyers contended in a case that was ruled on in favor of the Knicks by an arbitrator that a secret deal had already illegally been brokered by the Knicks and Dudley, which would circumvent league salary-cap restrictions.
Dudley's name has been mentioned in a couple of possible trade rumors recently, but he hopes to play four more years in the N.B.A., and the team he likes to play for is the Knicks.
"I like New York," said Dudley, who said he wants to work on Wall Street or in real estate after his playing career. "I like Rye. It's extremely pretty and convenient to Purchase College, where we practice, Westchester Airport, where the team flies out of, and the city."
On his longevity in the N.B.A,, Dudley said:
"To stay in the league for a while you have to do one thing real well, and mine has been rebounding. A lot of it is effort and simply going after missed shots. For my size, I always had quick jumps and quick pursuit to the ball."
Dudley was named the winner of the J. Walter Kennedy N.B.A. Citizenship Award in 1996 for his work with young diabetics. His basketball camp in Veronia, Ore., admitted 70 diabetic children from around the country last summer.
"It's a lot of work getting it all in place," Dudley said, explaining why the camp will remain in Oregon this summer instead of moving with Dudley to New York. "You need the doctors, nurses and donations from medical companies."
Dudley said that he has not had time to look for a charity to support in the Westchester-New York City area but that he and the Knicks are searching for an appropriate organization. Dudley appeared at the Dunleavy-Millbank Center, an after-school children's recreation site in Harlem earlier in this season for the N.B.A.'s Teamup program, a leaguewide event in which players work in the community.
Even as the diabetes has made his own life more difficult, Dudley said dealing with the disease on a daily basis is a mixed blessing. "The biggest thing was I had something I had to be aware of at all times," he said. "But it made me more disciplined, more regimented. I think that has helped me in my overall life."
As an athlete, Dudley said: "I don't eat things with a lot of sugar. I'll have a Diet Coke instead of a Coke. I test my blood sugar levels and take my shots before meals."
Dudley makes a habit of signing autographs. At a recent game against the Nets in New Jersey two days after he broke his nose in Orlando, for example, he left the locker room 90 minutes early for shooting practice and signed many for fans calling to him.
"New Haven says hello," said one fan, and Dudley replied about the city of his alma mater, "Oh yeah, how's New Haven?"
With a plastic mask covering his nose and eyes, Dudley began his warm-up ritual of receiving passes from a Knick assistant coach and shooting little hooks, jump shots and dunks around the basket. Then he moved to the free-throw line -- where he holds the dubious distinction of holding one of the worst career percentages (46 percent) -- and rolled off a number of shots. He grabbed a basketball and dribbled it the length of the floor one way with his right hand and back again with his left. Afterward, he sprawled out at midcourt and manipulated his lanky body in different directions while stretching.
Dudley began the game on the bench -- as he has done throughout most of his career -- and remained there for the entire game. In the Knicks' first 38 games this season, Dudley only averaged about 14 minutes a game and was not called upon at all in three games. By comparison, throughout 643 games he played before this season, Dudley averaged nearly 21 minutes a game.
Jeff Van Gundy, the Knicks' coach, said Dudley's reduced playing time is the result of the Knicks' needing more scoring production because of Ewing's absence. He also said opponents are fielding smaller and quicker squads.
Dudley has played more minutes recently against teams with bigger players like the Chicago Bulls, the Seattle Supersonics and the Boston Celtics, and he has been effective. While he said he can understand Van Gundy's reasoning, he does not always agree with it. "That has never been something that has kept me out of a game in the past," he said. "I think that works two ways, when you're big and stronger, you out-rebound them and pound them inside against a quicker, smaller team. When I'm playing the way I'm capable, then everything else should shake out."
Dudley said he senses a silver lining in the current season: "Sometimes, at the end of the year, when you turn things around for the better, you look back and it makes it that much more rewarding. I hope that's how it's going to work out here."

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: A Site That Crunches Numbers;
Refinancing On the Web

 BODY:
With mortgage rates low, many homeowners are wondering whether they should refinance. To help provide answers, Intuit Inc., the Mountain View, Calif., company that markets Quicken financial software, opened an electronic Refinance Center last week on its Quicken Mortgage Web site -- a cybershopping center for mortgages that the company started last November.
The center (www.quicken.com/mortgage) allows mortgage shoppers to provide information about their mortgage, such as the interest rate they are paying, the amount of the mortgage and the number of years and months remaining on it, and then quickly receive an assessment of the costs and benefits of refinancing. The assessment includes the size of the new monthly payment at current rates, and the number of years and months it would take before refinancing, net of the costs of taking out a new loan, would be profitable for the homeowner. 
 "The object is to get a quick feel for whether it makes sense to refinance," said Carl Reese, vice president of Intuit's Quicken Mortgage. He said the assessment was based on interest rates charged by the company's six participating lenders. Homeowners can obtain more information and determine whether they qualify for a particular mortgage by providing more data. Those who find an offer they like, Mr. Reese said, can instantly transfer their data to a participating lender, who will then contact the customer. "Information in our database is only sent to a lender at the customer's request," he said.

HEADLINE: Theater Air Rights Plan Awaits Reviews

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
LIKE the characters in "The Sunshine Boys," whose set they used for the announcement, city officials and leaders of the theater industry have reached entente after years of estrangement.
From the stage of the Lyceum Theater last month, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced a proposal in which more than two million square feet of air rights from 25 Broadway theaters, most of them landmarks, could be transferred easily throughout the Theater District and up to the edge of Clinton. 
 Developers could use the air rights, without going through public review, to increase the floor area of new towers by 20 percent. With a review and special permit, they could increase the floor area in towers on Broadway, Seventh Avenue and 42d Street by up to 40 percent. On Eighth Avenue, air rights could be used to increase floor area by up to 44 percent, although the resulting buildings would still be much smaller than those on Times Square.
Any theater from which air rights were transferred would have to be maintained as a legitimate Broadway playhouse. And with a special permit, builders of mixed-use developments on Broadway, Seventh Avenue and 42d Street would be granted extra floor area to accommodate new Broadway playhouses.
Joseph B. Rose, chairman of the City Planning Commission, promised from the stage of the Lyceum that under the proposal, real estate pressures would no longer "suffocate the theaters or be a threat but will actually nurture and support the future of the Broadway theater."
This was just Act I, however. The proposal has to go through public review in coming months. Critical questions are already in the air:
Would the zoning induce so much development along Eighth Avenue that it would displace low- and middle-income Clinton residents? Would it spread air rights over too wide an area with too little discretionary control? And why create incentives for a district in which private development is already under way? Would this be a precedent for other parts of the city?
Conversely, would there be a strong enough market for so many air rights, or would the size of the pool diminish their value? Would sales of air rights benefit the whole theater industry or merely developers and theater owners? Are theaters sufficiently protected over the long run? And is zoning the appropriate way to solve an economic problem?
These are some of the issues facing Community Board 4 in Clinton and Community Board 5 in midtown, the first stops in the review procedure. At the end, the proposal is subject to approval by the City Planning Commission and City Council. Speaker Peter F. Vallone was on stage at the Lyceum, but his aides said later he was there more to show support for the general goal of aiding Broadway theaters than to endorse the specific text of the zoning measures.
The Giuliani administration is convinced that exploitation of the real estate market is the key to bolstering Broadway's bottom line, increasing theatrical employment and preserving landmark playhouses.
Ten dollars a square foot from the sale of air rights (currently valued at about $50 a square foot) would go into a fund to benefit a nonprofit group called the Broadway Initiative, which seeks to cultivate new audiences and develop new plays and musicals.
"By allowing the transfer of air rights," Mayor Giuliani said, "it will produce needed capital and dollars for modernizing theaters, for building some new ones. And also the establishment of the fund -- which will involve actors, producers, people involved in the creative arts, as well as people in government and in the unions -- will allow us to support small musicals, allow us to support experimental works. And it will also insure that these buildings remain theaters."
ALTHOUGH air rights from several Broadway theaters have already been used in nearby developments, Mr. Rose said generally that "the ways they can recoup their value as development sites don't work."
Air rights, also known as unused development rights, represent the difference between the size of an existing building and the maximum that zoning rules would allow on the lot. Because theaters are not tall, they tend to have ample air rights. But transfer opportunities are generally limited under zoning laws to sites that are adjacent, across the street, cater-corner or linked by common ownership.
If air rights could easily float between Eighth Avenue and the Avenue of the Americas, 40th and 57th Streets, planners and owners believe development pressure would shift away from the mid-block areas where most theaters are found.
Moreover, Mr. Rose said, the proposal would guide development on Eighth Avenue by requiring that new buildings have a strong "street wall"; that is, a fairly uniform and relatively low-rise frontage, more in keeping with the tenement scale of Clinton than the skyscrapers of Times Square.
But neighborhood leaders worry that the proposal may wind up hurting Clinton residents, including actors, musicians, ushers and stagehands who have benefited from the relatively lower rents in the area.
"The issues that haven't been discussed are the effects on the Clinton community and what it means for a city -- not just a cityscape," said Pamela Frederick, chairwoman of Community Board 4. "They act as if zoning doesn't affect people."
"The actors said they're going to be out in Hoboken before they know it," Ms. Frederick said. Clinton residents see the proposal as a "threat to their homes," she said, and are "really galvanizing against this thing."
While neither Board 4 nor Board 5 has taken a formal position, the chairwomen of both said they would almost certainly oppose the inclusion of the west side of Eighth Avenue in the district to which theater air rights can be transferred.
The Municipal Art Society takes much the same position, said its president, Brendan Sexton. It is also concerned that the theater preservation guarantee runs unequivocally for only 25 years, after which an owner could apply for a permit to convert the playhouse to another use.
Without trying to predict the future, city planners identified 22 potential sites where air rights would theoretically be most likely to land, based on ownership patterns, current use and density. Eleven of these hypothetical sites are on Eighth Avenue, while nine are on Broadway or Seventh Avenue.
"I think in two cycles you'll see the majority of these development rights move to the avenues," said Rebecca Robertson, vice president of real estate at the Shubert Organization and former president of the 42d Street Development Project, a state agency.
SHUBERT is by far the largest of the theater owners. Twelve of its houses, with 1.1 million square feet of air rights, would be affected by the new zoning.
Ms. Robertson said revenues from the sale of air rights, plus the construction incentive, might propel Shubert to build a theater with 1,800 seats or more. "It would be a fabulous thing to build a true state-of-the-art musical house," she said. "We think we'd be a great partner for a hotel developer in particular but we'd be a good partner for anybody." She would not elaborate any more than to say that Shubert might be a tenant in a mixed-use project or own the theater as a condominium unit.
Ms. Robertson said the sale of air rights would provide a vital source of income to help existing theaters through long periods when nothing is playing.
One possible transfer would be from Shubert's Winter Garden at Broadway and 50th Street (which has 285,000 square feet of air rights) to the Rockefeller Plaza West project on Seventh Avenue, between 49th and 50th Streets (which might be allowed under the new rules to grow from 1 million to 1.3 million square feet through the use of theater air rights). Neither Ms. Robertson nor executives of the Rockefeller Group Development Corporation would comment.
Another big site affected by the zoning proposal is on the Avenue of the Americas, between 42d and 43d Streets. It is largely controlled by the Durst Organization, which is building the Four Times Square tower on the west end of the block. Douglas Durst, the company's president, said the new zoning "could be very helpful," particularly the theater construction incentive.
Robert E. Nederlander, president of the Nederlander Organization, which owns four affected theaters, also said the proposal would be "helpful" but added that any owner would "have to weigh the benefits and burdens" before deciding to transfer air rights under its restrictions.
For example, air rights from the Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, might be worth $6.5 million. (The building has 24,975 square feet of floor area where zoning rules would permit 155,800, leaving 130,825 square feet of unused rights.) But maintenance costs are about $250,000 a year, whether the theater is used or not. And until "Rent," the Nederlander had not housed a hit in 15 years.
What would happen if buyers were not found? That was a question raised by a member of the City Planning Commission, Brenda Levin, as the land-use review began earlier this month. Although she said she shared the belief that the city ought to help the theater industry, Ms. Levin wondered whether that goal was best served by an unpredictable real estate market.
Looking at the question from a different angle, another commission member, Amanda M. Burden, raised questions at the hearing about the overall impact of the proposal if all the air rights were exploited, particularly since many transfers could occur without public review.
Mr. Rose said that ultimately there would be only a "marginal increase in density," and that the proposal would distribute development potential more evenly throughout the theater district.
BUT critics argue that by making air rights easier to use, planners invite the construction of additional floor space that would probably not otherwise be built -- thus practically raising density, even if not technically doing so.
"All New Yorkers are going to have to live with bigger buildings in mid-Manhattan in order for the theater industry to prosper," said Kevin A. Finnegan, chairman of the Eighth Avenue rezoning task force of Community Board 5. "I have to question whether zoning is the proper mechanism for assisting the theater industry."
There are two other zoning districts, around Grand Central Terminal and the South Street Seaport, where a more liberal transfer of air rights are allowed. They have scarcely proliferated over the years and city planners believe each district has a distinct rationale.
That does not stop some local leaders from wondering whether the Giuliani administration will use this zoning approach elsewhere. Lola Finkelstein, chairwoman of Community Board 5, said, "We are concerned that the wider transfer of development rights can be a precedent that would be upsetting to the whole planning process in New York."

Through the Windshield, A Vision for the State

BYLINE: By Jennifer Preston; Jennifer Preston is Trenton bureau chief of The New York Times.

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
When Governor Whitman announced four years ago that she would not use the state helicopter to get to most of her official events, she saved the state $7 million -- and earned some political points.
But perhaps the biggest gain for New Jersey from her decision to be driven around the state is what she saw from her car window. 
 As governor, you get to every corner of the state. And from her car, Mrs. Whitman could not help but see the impact of years of poor land-use planning. The abandoned buildings in once-thriving urban neighborhoods. Suburban sprawl clogging already congested roadways. Unbridled development on farmland in communities that do not have the infrastructure and other resources to support it.
"Spending so much time in a car seeing New Jersey roll by has given me a sense of urgency about our state's future," Mrs. Whitman said during her second inaugural address last week. "I have a vision for that future -- a vision for rebuilding our cities, preserving our open space and enriching our sense of personal responsibility."
It was a bold, ambitious agenda, one that insures Mrs. Whitman a legacy as one of the state's most visionary and important governors -- if she succeeds in making it a reality.
Even Democrats, who have been quick to criticize Mrs. Whitman for not offering a vision beyond cutting taxes, offered warm praise for her ideas.
"She set forth a strong, clear vision for an activist government," said James E. McGreevey, the Democrat who nearly defeated Mrs. Whitman last fall. "It was a progressive agenda that Democrats and Republicans alike ought to support."
Senator Robert G. Torricelli, also a Democrat, said: "I admire Governor Whitman for taking on the fight. I hope that she has the strength to win."
Mrs. Whitman may face opposition from her own party within the Republican-controlled Legislature for some of her plans. Builders and developers have been longtime contributors to the state's Republican Party, and they can be expected to put up a strong fight.
Also, most land-use decisions are made by local officials. Over the years, many local officials have embraced new development because of the prospect of expanding the property tax base. But many towns are now struggling with the high cost of expanding services. Persuading some municipalities to consider the cost of new development over the long run will not be easy.
Then there is the state government bureaucracy. State officials have virtually ignored New Jersey's five-year-old master plan, which has determined what areas of the state should accommodate further development.
Mrs. Whitman said she has directed her administration to use the state plan as a "fundamental guide" in making permit and financing decisions. She promises swift state approval for development projects that are consistent with the state plan's goals.
She also proposes preserving 300,000 more acres during her next term, with an ultimate goal of protecting 1 million acres over the next decade. What she did not spell out last week, however, is where she would get the money. In the past, New Jerseyans have regularly supported bond issues to preserve open space. But they may not be so quick to support a tax increase.
For the nation's cities, Mrs. Whitman proposes spending $400 million to help mayors reclaim abandoned buildings and turn them into affordable housing. In the past, Republican lawmakers have demonstrated their reluctance to pour more state dollars into urban areas, since most of their constituents do not live in them.
Also, it will take much more than turning vacant buildings into affordable housing to revive cities.
Although Mrs. Whitman has repeatedly emphasized the importance of creating jobs in New Jersey, she did not offer any new programs to spur economic development in urban areas. The cities have not shared in the recent economic boom. Cities need jobs and affordable housing. More jobs in cities also means fewer people willing to move far away from them.
Mrs. Whitman has taken some positive steps in this direction. She recently signed legislation aimed at making abandoned factories and vacant land in cities more attractive to developers. In her first term, she also expanded programs to lure businesses and commercial development to cities, like enterprise zones that offer tax breaks to companies.
But is the Whitman administration prepared to move even more aggressively to direct companies to locate in urban areas? Will state-financed incentives continue to be offered to companies that want to locate in suburban office parks that planners say often contribute to suburban sprawl?
Mrs. Whitman demonstrated that she has a vision to take on the most important problems facing New Jersey. She has vowed to tackle problems that have defied solution, not only in New Jersey but across the country.
The first measure of her commitment will come next month, when she unveils her new state budget and shows how she will back up her pledges with state dollars. The next measure will be her efforts to persuade reluctant state lawmakers to support her plan and bureaucrats to carry it out.
The changes, if they come, will not be hard to see. Just look out your car window.

HEADLINE: SPENDING IT;
A Mortgage Broker Fee on the Ropes

BYLINE: By CAROL MARIE CROPPER 

 BODY:
THE battle between home buyers and the mortgage industry intensified recently when a Federal appeals court ruled that certain fees banks pay to mortgage brokers were little more than kickbacks.
At issue is an estimated $7 billion annually in "yield spread premiums," the fees the mortgage lenders pay the brokers for sending customers to them for their loans. They are paid when the mortgage broker gets the home buyer to pay an interest rate higher than he could otherwise get at the same bank. 
 Consumer advocates say banning the fees will mean lower interest rates for home buyers using brokers.
But the banking industry says that the premium is an accepted way to compensate brokers who generate loans for them, and that it cuts a buyer's closing costs by shifting part of the broker's fee, otherwise paid by the borrower, to the lender.
Still, in a growing number of lawsuits around the country, home buyers and consumer advocates say the fee is little more than an inducement for a broker to misrepresent the lowest available mortgage rates.
Earlier this month, the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit in Atlanta ruled in Culpepper v. Inland Mortgage that the $1,263 yield spread premium paid by Inland to a broker was a violation of the Federal Real Estate Settlement Procedure Act's rule against kickbacks.
It was the first decision on the issue by an appellate court and it overturned a summary judgment by the Federal District Court in Birmingham, Ala., that the fee was permissible. Unless reversed, the appellate ruling will govern cases brought in the circuit, which includes Alabama, Florida and Georgia. Lower courts in other jurisdictions could also look to it as a precedent.
The decision came in a 1996 suit against the Inland Mortgage Corporation, now known as the Irwin Mortgage Corporation, based in Indianapolis. A Birmingham couple, John and Patricia Culpepper, sued after taking out a $76,000 home loan in 1995.
They contended that, while they had paid Premiere Mortgage, the broker that prepared their loan papers, a $760 origination fee, Inland had paid the additional premium because Premiere wrote the loan at an interest rate of 7.5 percent rather than the 7.25 percent they could have qualified for at Inland.
"It is undisputed that the payment of the yield spread premium was not tied to the quantity or quality of the services that Premiere provided," the court ruled. "Rather, the sole determinant of whether a yield spread premium would be paid was the interest rate on the loan."
The Mortgage Bankers Association of America, in a friend-of-the-court brief supporting Inland's position, estimated that lenders paid brokers, who now arrange more than half of all mortgage loans, $7 billion in such fees in 1996.
David Donaldson, the Culpeppers' lawyer, called the ruling "a landmark decision that protects consumers against these abusive practices."
"Unless the mortgage banking industry wants to violate the law, they're going to have to change," he said.
Lawyers for the industry, though, said the ruling might not be that big a victory for home buyers, since it did not address whether the case, which was sent back to the District Court for final disposition, would become a class action.
A class-action lawsuit would be a major headache for the industry, said William Cumberland, general counsel for the Mortgage Bankers Association. "Class actions don't go to trial," he said. "The threat of loss is so great that you've got to settle."
Even when there is no class-action threat, the industry has been settling some cases. Last year, for example, a Federal district judge in Virginia found against the practice of yield spread premiums. But the case was settled after the judge denied the motion for class-action certification.
Robert Platte, a lawyer for Irwin Mortgage, argued that it was also unclear whether the ruling calling the fee a violation of the real estate act is open for reconsideration when the case goes back to the lower court. Irwin has not decided whether it will ask the appeals court to reconsider its opinion, Mr. Platte said.

Saving Salmon In the Atlantic Makes Sense

BYLINE: By Nelson Bryant 

 BODY:
A few days ago, I thawed out a small Atlantic salmon that I caught in Caribou Pool on the Upsalquitch River in Canada last summer, and poached it for supper.
Handsomely bedecked with sliced cucumbers, sliced hard-boiled eggs and served cold with a fresh dill, lemon juice, caper and sour cream sauce, it received the reverential treatment Ruth and I always accord one of its kind. 
 There was poignancy in our traditional "thanks to salmon and the gods of the chase" invocation because it was, I had resolved, the last Atlantic salmon I would kill until I am persuaded that the species is well on the road to recovery.
Atlantic salmon populations of North American origin -- the only ones for which I fish -- are at their lowest points in history. This situation developed after nearly three decades of conservation efforts that until about three years ago seemed to be working. Those efforts included severely curtailing the daily and seasonal bag limits for recreational anglers, ending most netting of the species off Canada, and establishing, through an international organization, quotas for salmon fisheries off Greenland and the Faeroe Islands, locations to which the salmon travel while at sea.
My decision not to kill salmon was triggered by a November 1997 resolution of the Atlantic Salmon Federation that asked anglers to release all of the salmon they catch, even if keeping them is legal. The World Wildlife Fund and the Salmon Trust of Scotland have endorsed this proposal. Even if anglers agree to this, it isn't very likely that the salmon's plunge toward erasure will be halted, but it is one way to immediately reduce the attrition on this glorious fish.
Some anglers are already releasing all or most of the salmon they catch. And even now in eastern Canada, which accounts for almost all the wild salmon of North American origin, Quebec and Labrador are the only places where anglers may keep a large salmon, one that has been at sea for more than one year and produces more eggs than a grilse, a salmon that returns to its natal stream to spawn after only a year in the ocean.
Elsewhere in Canada, only grilse may be kept -- no more than seven of them at the most -- during an entire season. Salmon conservationists have also successfully promoted salmon farming. Today more than 95 percent of the salmon sold in the world market are farmed fish.
There is a twist to this success story, however. Farmed salmon that escape from their cages are mating with wild salmon and producing strains with inferior spawning capabilities.
Why, given the plight of the salmon, would reasonable anglers be reluctant to release all of the salmon that they catch? Some might reason that commercial fishermen, American Indians under special dispensation and many recreational anglers are killing salmon, so why shouldn't we? Still others, and I was one of them until recently, are enmeshed in a food-gathering mystique that, in the case of salmon or any other similarly threatened species, cannot be justified.
As one whose childhood was spent in rural surroundings in the late 1920's and early 30's, fishing -- whether for trout, perch, striped bass or bluefish -- was fun, but it was also for food. For me, cleaning, cooking and eating the catch brought the endeavor full circle, and lifted it beyond the mere pursuit of recreation. For decades I felt that luring, hooking, playing and releasing all fish, presumably to demonstrate one's skill and to observe and experience the quarry's antics, was silly.
Today I no longer feel this way and realize that I was carrying old attitudes into a new era, an era in which there are too many of us pursuing too few fish. I was failing to comprehend that angling without food in mind can be both honorable and pleasurable. If a species of fish is in deep trouble and laws do not provide for its adequate protection, why shouldn't thinking anglers impose a no-kill restriction on themselves and hope that others will emulate them?
Studies have shown that, if warming water has not placed them under stress, nearly all salmon survive the trauma of catch and release if brought to shore as swiftly as possible and handled properly during release.
Thus it would be possible to sustain the thriving sport fishing industry for salmon in Canada without a single fish being killed intentionally, an all-important consideration for a country that is plagued by unemployment.
The greatest threat to the salmon is commercial fishing in salt water for mixed stocks of the species. Such salmon could be from several rivers, and there is no way for the fishermen to identify their origin as they tumble on board.
There are other problems: proliferation of salmon-eating seals; the degradation of salmon rivers by bad logging practices and acid rain, and the disruption of the oceanic food chain by overfishing. A bizarre example of a potential disruption is the Danes' fishery for sand eels in the North Sea. These ubiquitous little forage fish, which are near the bottom of the food chain, are being processed for use, among other things, as fuel oil.
So to the salmon angler I say go forth and hone your skills, return your precious quarry to the water, and perhaps there will come a time when -- with a clear conscience -- you can bear a wild fish to the table triumphantly.

Farewell to Arms, Hello to Doubts

BYLINE: By MELINDA HENNEBERGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
ON Mark Hoye's desk in the brand-new suburban offices of the mortgage company where he works are a few reminders of his former life as a Navy aviator -- a model of the P3 Orion submarine tracker he navigated in the Persian Gulf and the plaque they gave him after he came home.
He unconsciously hugs the plaque to his chest as he tells about the time he and his crew spotted some Iraqis rolling free-floating mines off a speedboat. Using radar to "paint" the surface of the ocean, his team marked them for destruction by smart bomb. He got a nice letter from the high command for that one, he says. 
 And about two years later, in the huge downsizing that shrank the ranks of the United States military to 1.4 million from 2.1 million over the last decade, he was pushed into early retirement at age 33.
Like many others who left the military in the years after the cold war, Mr. Hoye eventually found a good job in a good economy. He bought a house in Virginia and has gotten to know his children in a way that he says would never have been possible in the military.
Still, the transition has been bewildering.
He knew he could fly a plane from Japan to a dot in the Indian Ocean and not get lost; he did not know how to steer clear of office politics. He knew he could be locked in a small, dark space and keep his cool; he did not know how to handle the everyday domestic stresses that go with being a husband and father who is around more.
After leaving the Navy nearly five years ago, at the height of the reductions in force, Mr. Hoye worked for two different start-up satellite communications companies that eventually went under. He also went to graduate school to study international business -- "a waste of money," he says -- before finding his current position, as a loan officer, nine months ago.
Along the way, he struggled with depression, new strains on his marriage and the strange feeling that he had almost been relocated to some alien planet.
"We crushed the Iraqis and had a feeling of accomplishment, and the drawdown hit us hard," said Mr. Hoye, now 37, whose neat pinstripes and perfectly shined shoes set him apart in a dressed-down office. "We didn't understand, and none of us wanted to go. I'm starting to do better, but there have been some rough periods."
In the military, he said, "what I did mattered."
"What I was doing was on the front page of all the world's newspapers," he said. "To be yanked out of that in midcareer -- I have not stopped grieving. I try to keep myself entertained. I have season tickets to the Orioles. But there's just as much stress now, where you just want to choke somebody on the phone. And I felt safer in my P3 Orion than driving on I-95 every day."
Of course, some former soldiers and sailors have always found civilian life more daunting than war. And while no one has gathered data on the more than 700,000 men and women who have left the military since the late 1980's, it is clear that many of every rank go on to do extremely well.
But many who were pushed out of the military say they remain traumatized by the experience, whether they were literally asked to leave, were offered early retirement, were denied a promotion in a force with fewer opportunities or decided for other reasons not to stay in a smaller military.
Many had never received a negative job evaluation, so they were both hurt and uncomprehending: What had they done wrong? And what of the job security they had counted on? Some said they felt even more betrayed than private-sector employees in similar situations because there are no other jobs in their field, strictly speaking; you cannot apply to the Navy when the Air Force does not want you anymore.
Sam Martin, a public-affairs officer who was asked to leave the Air Force in 1992 after almost 26 years of steady advancement, said he found the change stimulating -- once he got over the initial shock.
Today, teaching civics to eighth graders at Rocky Run Middle School in Chantilly, Va., Mr. Martin, 55, says he is completely engaged in his new work. "The kids do not snap to attention," he laughed. "But they're good kids; they keep you in stitches. I equate the military officer and the teacher trying to do so much for the nation."
Others, however, remain deeply resentful, feeling that their sacrifices were repaid with ingratitude. And not one of the several dozen former military men and women interviewed for this article said the shift had been painless.
They have gone from a highly structured life to winging it, from knowing years in advance what their next move would be to the uncertainty of the private sector, from being part of a community to standing alone. Some said that they felt uncertain for a while about their clothes, hair and other matters of personal style, and that they had to work on their manner of speech, too, turning "0900 hours" back into "9 o'clock."
One former officer had never had a business lunch until a couple of years ago and was unsure how to behave. Another found it strange that in his new job, nobody knew how much money anyone else was making. Several said that they were initially too trusting of employers and colleagues and too-good-to-be-true job offers. You have to trust the guy in the next foxhole, they concluded, but the guy in the next cubicle may be a different story.
"I have business associates now, as opposed to people you work with who are truly your friends," said Nadine R. Kokolis, 30, of Chantilly. Ms. Kokolis said she liked her new life but missed the camaraderie in the Army Corps of Engineers.
More than a few veteran officers lamented their skimpy business experience, even when they had shouldered considerable responsibility in the military. Some said they felt misled about how much their management skills would help in the private sector.
And despite a variety of career transition programs, some said they came out of the service without much of a plan for the future, because military culture has traditionally frowned on those who spend much time preparing for their next job, instead of focusing 100 percent on the mission at hand. There is a sneering term for that: retired on active duty.
So, several former officers said, they worked hard until the end of their last day, and then figured the rest out later.
"It's like dying," said Steve Strobridge, a retired Air Force colonel who works for the Retired Officers Association in Alexandria, Va. "It sneaks up on you."
MOST of those who were actually asked to leave the military already had 20 years of service and were eligible for pensions. And those who were within a few years of qualifying for a pension were offered early retirement on a case-by-case basis, receiving a choice of a lump sum or monthly payments based on the number of years they had served. The monthly payments ranged from $471 for the lowest-ranking enlisted person to $2,349 for commissioned officers. The lump sums were about $12,000 to almost $150,000, based on pay grade and years of service.
Others with less experience were told that they had little chance of promotion in a shrinking military, and while they were not literally dismissed, they were encouraged to look for other work. And most of those who left under those circumstances got no severance package.
There are roughly 90,000 former military men and women in the Washington area, many of them drawn here by military industry and Government jobs. But a number of those have recently been forced back into the job market for a second and even a third time because both of those sectors are shrinking, too.
Because many military officers were given considerable responsibility at a younger age than would generally be possible in the private sector, most do very well in their new fields, said H. W. Buse 3d, a former Marine colonel who runs a job placement service at the Retired Officers Association. Mr. Buse said his clients usually found other jobs in one to three months -- though the average was closer to six months at the height of the downsizing.
Stephen Wright, an official of the regional blood bank operations affiliated with the American Red Cross, has hired several former military officers in the last year and is so impressed that he now looks for them when there are openings.
"I find them to be good hires for managers' jobs because military people tend to be very disciplined, focused and very flexible, which in our operation is a real asset," said Mr. Wright, who said he had no military background beyond the Reserve Officers Training Corps in school. "A lot of them have had some medical training, too, so their learning curve tends to be shorter."
Of course, while officers with such technical skills are usually snapped up right away, military generalists -- infantry soldiers, for example -- often find it more difficult to find the right job. And even if they do find a comparable position, they may not find it as satisfying. In the Army, a clerk is not only a clerk but a soldier who happens to be a clerk, a part of the team.
On a recent morning, about 40 former military men and women who were looking for work gathered at the Army-Navy Club in downtown Washington for a monthly breakfast organized by Peter McCarthy, who runs a career counseling and outplacement service, McCarthy & Company. When he retired from the Marines and took a job in investment banking 18 years ago, he said, he felt like "a giant tuna swimming in the Baltimore aquarium with a bunch of piranha."
This morning, as he he surveys the crowd lining up for eggs and sausage, he talks about why he feels a little protective of them.
"I don't want them to jump into something entrepreneurial too quickly," he says. "They may be too trusting of somebody saying, 'Invest in this business.' They have no real-world experience."
Across a room full of people with excellent posture, nice manners and the unmistakable look of apprehension that says, "How did it ever come to this?" Mr. McCarthy spies one of the success stories he has invited here to give a little pep talk, and he motions him over. Al Ross, a former Navy captain who retired in 1993 after 26 years, says he now has a healthy business in international marketing consulting -- despite having come out of the service with little idea of how to proceed.
"My business has evolved, but not as the result of any master plan," Mr. Ross says, laughing. "Networking in the military is kind of distasteful. That would be getting ahead not on merit but on who you know."
After breakfast, Mr. McCarthy gets up and asks everyone to take a turn giving "a 30-second commercial on yourself."
"And remember the golden rule. What's that, gentlemen?" he says, putting a hand to his ear. "I can't hear you! It's "No acronyms!' " They're lost, he said, on people in the private sector.
At Mr. McCarthy's table, one man calls him "sir" and gets a reprimand. "You drop that," Mr. McCarthy tells him, "or you're going to intimidate the hell out of people."
The man, Neil Nelson, still in Army uniform, is a colonel who plans to retire next October. He starts again: "Sir, I -- oh, I apologize, I'll get used to it. It's been 32 years."
Another man at the table, Joel Keefer, who left the Navy in 1993 after 22 years, says he is seeking work again, in public relations. He had worked for a health care telecommunications company that later folded.
The loyalty and can-do attitude that served so well in the military have not been much help in civilian life so far, he says, seeming a little embarrassed that he stuck with the company to the end.
He stayed on even after the company stopped paying him, though he eventually got a check, and he still says "us" when he refers to the business. "I knew the end was coming, but my approach was, 'Stay with it and we can make this work,' " says Mr. Keefer, 48, who lives in Vienna, Va. "I don't want to say I had blind faith, but I trusted the situation. If I had shifted my attention to getting another position, it wouldn't have been so stressful."
Even those who have found good jobs quickly say they have found some aspects of civilian life confounding.
After six promotions in three years at two different companies, Marty Keeley, 46, a former Marine infantry officer, is now president and chief executive of Ingram Library Services, a unit of Ingram Industries, a book distributor based near Nashville. Even so, he says, he has faced "a vertical learning curve" during the last few years in bridging the cultural divide between military and civilian life.
He found that even socializing was a new experience outside the military, without the framework of strict rules about fraternization. And especially among people his own age, he has felt he had to overcome certain stereotypes about the military. "Some you have to win them over, like, 'Hey, I'm not a baby killer,' " Mr. Keeley said.
Still, he said, he would never have done as well without his experience in the military. "I'm not using the survival skills I learned as an infantry officer; I haven't rappelled since I left," he explained. "But I use the persuasive skills every day."
WHATEVER the challenges, few veteran officers are openly critical of their treatment, either by the military or civilian employers. "You do what you've got to do and let everyone else whine and complain," said a former Air Force captain, one of many who says he has a "consulting business" but means he is mostly looking for work. "I'm looking," he said, "but I've succeeded in everything I've done, and I make no excuses for myself."
And many retain such great affection for the military that they would return to the fold tomorrow, if they could. Mr. Hoye, who misses his days as a Naval officer, knows there's no going back but hopes that his sons, Tyler, now 3, and Matthew, 6, will someday pick up where he left off.
"My dream for them," he said, "is the Naval Academy."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Scandals Can Hurt Bulls and Presidents

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
Scandal engulfed Washington. A recession arrived. Stock prices plunged. The Vice President replaced the President.
That describes the situation 25 years ago, when the Watergate scandal dominated the news. And it describes what happened 50 years earlier, in the Teapot Dome scandal. 
 A new scandal is engrossing the country. And though it is premature to talk of the end of Bill Clinton's Presidency, that did not stop Wall Street traders last week, some of whom saw signs of his demise in everything from rising gold prices to a declining dollar. Falling tobacco stocks, they said, showed that investors feared that a President Al Gore would be even tougher on cigarettes.
Even allowing for Wall Street's tendency to leap to conclusions, there are parallels to be pondered. In 1923, a scandal broke about corrupt leases of Government oilfields known as Teapot Dome. It might have led to the impeachment of President Warren G. Harding had he not died before the news came out. A recession arrived, perhaps exacerbated by currency collapse in Germany and an earthquake that devastated Japan.
The stock market outlook appeared to be bright as 1923 began, and when the Dow Jones industrial average peaked in March, it was up 62 percent in less than two years. By late October, with the recession on, the Dow had lost 19 percent of its value. Not, as bear markets go, a severe one, but one that alarmed a lot of investors.
In January 1973, a quarter of a century ago, the Dow peaked at a record 1,051.69, up 67 percent in less than three years. It had been merely the most recent leg of a long bull market, which had seen the index leap more than 1,000 percent in just over 30 years, beginning on an April day in 1942 when World War II news was dismaying.
From early 1973 to late 1974, as the Presidency of Richard M. Nixon fell apart and as that of his successor began, the Dow fell 45 percent. A Mideast war brought on an oil price shock and a severe recession.
Some people date the current bull market to that day in December 1974 when share prices bottomed amid worries that the United States could not compete in a world of soaring commodity prices. From then until the Dow's peak last summer, a span of more than 23 years, the Dow was up more than 1,300 percent.
The 1923-24 recession was a mild one, and the bear market of 1923 was soon forgotten as share prices recovered and then went on a wild upward ride that ended with the 1929 crash. After 1973, by contrast, the stock market did not recover for nearly a decade, as investors became thoroughly disenchanted.
Consider the changing nature of scandals: Early in this century, it was politicians going after money. In the Nixon years, it was a search for power, and a desire to destroy political opponents, that brought down a Presidency. Now the allegations concern sex. This does not sound like progress.
In 1923, and 1973, disturbing overseas events came along as Washington was preoccupied with its own problems. Would the foreign problems have had less impact and been dealt with better had scandal not consumed the capital? There is no way to tell.
Now, with Asia in crisis, Congress appears to be more interested in whether the President lied about his sexual conduct than it is in coming up with the money needed to bolster the International Monetary Fund.
Investors should hope that this scandal quickly fades away. When scandals dominate Washington, bulls rarely dominate Wall Street.

HEADLINE: The World: The Curse of Riches;
In Africa, Wealth Often Buys Only Trouble

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast

 BODY:
SENSING a killing to be made, Jean-Raymond Boulle, the founder of an aggressive mining upstart called American Mineral Fields, picked sides early in the civil war that swept Zaire last year.
Visiting the rebel headquarters at Goma, Mr. Boulle loaned his company's airplane to the movement led by Laurent Kabila and reportedly also made a gift of badly-needed cash. And before Mr. Kabila could even capture the capital, Kinshasa, as he did in May, Mr. Boulle's company won a $1 billion contract to exploit what is perhaps the world's richest deposit of copper and cobalt, at Kolwezi in the south of the country. 
 Or so Mr. Boulle thought.
Since taking power, and renaming his country the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mr. Kabila's Government has rescinded the American Mineral Fields deal, and now appears poised to award the same deposits to the South African mining giant Anglo-American. Local and foreign news reports say that Anglo-American has on its payroll a nephew of Congo's powerful Minister of the Economy who is, at the same time, an employee of that ministry.
With American Mineral Fields having filed a $3 billion lawsuit against Anglo-American, courts will soon decide whether corruption influenced the Kolwezi deal.
Whatever the courts find, one thing seems clear already to many mining analysts: At the very least, the murky dealings around a huge contract like this will dim the prospects for a major injection of private investment capital that the Congo sorely needs -- and that should be easy enough to attract, given that Congo boasts the world's largest reserves of diamonds and cobalt, and among the richest supplies of copper.
And so Africa has yet another reason to wonder just how lucky it is to have the vast riches that lie under its soil, just waiting to be exploited.
 
'Geological Scandals'
For decades, countries like Congo and a score of other African nations have been humorously described as "geological scandals." The term was intended to convey a sense of their embarrassment of mineral riches. But over the years, it has also become an apt description of the state of affairs that seems to prevail wherever plentiful natural resources are found.
African countries aren't the only geological scandals, of course. Oil producers from Mexico and Venezuela to the Shah's Iran or the Sultanate of Brunei have seen huge oil windfalls either feed the pockets of corrupt political elites, pay for monuments to leaders' egos or set off ruinous spending sprees.
But in much of Africa, where the structures of modern government are relatively young and still weak, where illiteracy is high and checks and balances few, the temptations for leaders to do as they wish with their nations' wealth is particularly high.
Some minerals, diamonds in particular, especially lend themselves to fraudulent practices. And the states that produce them in large quantities -- Angola, Sierra Leone, Congo and the Central African Republic -- would make any hit parade of squandered wealth and stunted economic development.
Gems are so problematic because they are easily smuggled, their production goes under-declared and their value gets deliberately underestimated.
Thus, for Mr. Kabila the challenge ahead will not be to find resources with which to generate income. Rather, the challenge is arguably even more daunting: to make sure that the mineral wealth is not simply siphoned off corruptly, leaving a few local millionaires and, in all likelihood, quite a few more contented shareholders of the companies that win contracts to exploit the riches.
 
Easy Targets
Judging by the experience of many countries, international business interests are acutely aware of the weaknesses in the political and economic systems of the new African countries, and rush to exploit them to their advantage whenever they can.
Liberia, for example, is emerging from a devastating civil war that was both fueled by and fought over control of the country's rich mixture of resources -- from abundant diamonds and gold to vast stands of scarcely exploited tropical hardwoods that fetch high prices on international markets.
After starting his country's civil war, Liberia's recently elected President, Charles G. Taylor, was popularly known throughout West Africa as "Superglue," because, it was said, everything he touched he kept.
So far, Western diplomats credit Mr. Taylor with a surprising effort to turn over a new leaf. But even before his government could restore running water or electricity in much of the bombed-out capital, Monrovia, the city's few hotels were jammed with prowling foreign investors offering cash up front for shady mineral deals.
"A lot of people have come here offering quick money to Liberia, and when a Government comes to power and finds only $17,000 in the treasury, as we did, the temptation can be powerful," said Elie Saleeby, Mr. Taylor's finance minister. "People don't believe you when you tell them you don't want it. But we are determined to start off the right way, and that means reducing our debts and not taking on bad new ones."
The examples of those who successfully resist such temptations are, predictably, few when compared to those for whom profligate use of abundant mineral wealth becomes as compulsive as a heroin addiction.
The story of Mr. Kabila's neighbor to the west, the Republic of Congo, is instructive. With only two million people, this Congo, a former French colony, should by all rights be one of Africa's most affluent societies, if not one of the world's. It has oil, valuable hardwood forests and many other untapped natural riches.
 
Where Are the Roads?
And yet the Congo Republic, in 38 years of independence, has scarcely paved any roads, built any factories or created any new housing for its people.
The reason, many Congolese say, is that the country's small elite has spent almost all its energy fighting -- often along ethnic and regional lines -- over control of the plentiful riches rather than seeking to use them in ways that would generate new wealth for the benefit of the whole society.
The large foreign oil concerns operating in Congo, like the French company Elf, have apparently been all too willing participants in this game, providing large amounts of money up front -- money that can be used for everything from personal enrichment and political payoffs to arms purchases -- in order to tie down oil production into the distant future.
Now, in spite of its immense wealth, the tiny Congo Republic finds itself digging out with difficulty from a devastating four-month civil war, fought last year between partisans of a sitting President and his predecessor, for control of this manna. And when the cleanup of the destroyed capital, Brazzaville, is completed, the country's citizens will find themselves burdened by one of the world's highest levels of national debt per capita.
Asked how he would spend his forced retirement, the defeated Congolese President, Pascal Lissouba, recently told the French weekly, L'Autre Afrique: "I will be distilling the fruits of my experience and sharing it. I have understood, for example, just how tragic it is to live in a country so richly endowed. Our wealth has given us nothing but problems."
