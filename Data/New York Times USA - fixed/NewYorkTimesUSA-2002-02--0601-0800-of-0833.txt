HEADLINE: Rethinking Rail Travel 

 BODY:
The nation's highway system does not make a profit. Nor does the commercial aviation system. Nor does passenger rail. However, only one of these three vital links in America's transportation network, the railroad, is being asked to break even. Congress must abandon its fantasy that Amtrak can be self-sufficient. Only then can it engage in an honest debate about the kind of passenger rail system the country needs, and how to pay for it. 
 In 1997, in exchange for meager subsidies, Congress required that Amtrak be "operationally self-sufficient" by December of this year, or else. It is "or else" time, and the Amtrak Reform Council, created by the same law, is calling for radical restructuring. The council suggests that Amtrak be broken up into a regulatory agency, a regional body to assume ownership of the Northeast corridor track and an operating company. It would also like to open up certain routes to private competitors. 
 The council raises valid questions about Amtrak's accountability under the current arrangement, but new bureaucracies and privatization are not necessarily the solution. The fundamental problem undermining the nation's rail system, after all, is chronic underinvestment.
Ever since Congress created it in 1970 to allow private carriers to focus on hauling freight, Amtrak has been asked to do too much with too little. Amtrak's biggest financial burdens -- the council calls them unfunded mandates -- are long-haul trains and maintenance of the Northeast corridor. Amtrak's operating loss in 2001 was $1.1 billion, its largest ever. Long-distance overnight trains carrying 18 percent of all riders account for 75 percent of its loss. Meanwhile, not enough is being invested to upgrade antiquated infrastructure along the shorter, densely traveled corridors where trains make both economic and environmental sense. 
Congress and the public need to start thinking of fast, reliable trains that can link major cities in three hours or less as a key part of the overall transportation system's future. Once that happens, the roughly $3 billion a year needed over the next two decades to develop these high-speed corridors across the country will seem like a bargain, particularly when compared with what taxpayers spend on aviation and highways.
After Sept. 11, ridership levels soared by 40 percent along the Northeast corridor, where Amtrak trains do make an operating profit. Still, antiquated infrastructure means that the new high-speed Acela trains are unable to run at their optimal, 150-mile-an-hour speed for most of their journey from Boston to Washington. 
Crucial capital spending on the route, the Northeast's economic lifeline, should not be held hostage by the tiresome debates over Amtrak's annual appropriations. Instead, Washington should be focused on fundamental policy choices. Two come immediately to mind. One is to establish a source of dedicated revenue for the development of high-speed rail, much as highways and commercial aviation have their own trust funds. The other is to consider abandoning the long-haul routes, or at least finance them separately, in such a manner that they do not take dollars away from the sensible development of high-speed corridors. 
Long-distance trains with such evocative names as the Empire Builder and the Sunset Limited may have nostalgia value for train buffs and political value for members of Congress whose districts they service. But when one assesses the nation's transportation needs and available resources, it is hard not to conclude that they are an unaffordable extravagance. An honest debate about the future of passenger rail is long overdue. If it takes place, America can still salvage and strengthen the train system it really needs.

HEADLINE: Once Near Collapse, Kia Posts Its Best Annual Results Ever 

BYLINE:  By DON KIRK 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Feb. 18 

 BODY:
Kia Motors, which was on the brink of collapse during the depth of the Korean economic crisis in 1998, posted the best annual results in its 35-year history today.
 The automaker reported a net profit of $418 million for 2001, up 67 percent from 2000. 
 Kia, which was struggling under $10 billion in debt four years ago, owes its revival both to South Korea's improved economy and to its relationship with Hyundai Motor. 
Hyundai acquired 36 percent of Kia's stock in a controversial bidding process in 1998 and has revamped the company's management and consolidated production operations since then.
In fact, Kia's success in 2001 last year paralleled that of Hyundai, Korea's dominant motor vehicle maker. Earlier this month, Hyundai announced its own record net profit of $896 million, with the company's controlling stake in Kia accounting for part of the increase.
The jump in Kia's profits reflected record sales of 990,804 vehicles last year, including 223,721 shipped to the United States -- up 39 percent from the year before.
Gross earnings from sales last year climbed to $9.5 billion, an increase of 14.3 percent from 2000.
Kia -- like Hyundai Motor, which sold 1,598,965 vehicles last year -- said it expected United States sales to keep rising on the strength of minivans and midsize sedans that are now produced as veritable clones of Hyundai models.
Kia remained on an upward trajectory through the fourth quarter of 2001 with operating profits of $120 million. That was up 52 percent from the final three months of 2000, despite a 23 percent decline in net profits that analysts attributed to one-time gains reported near the end of 2000.
Kia's shares rose 25 percent last year on the Korea Stock Exchange. And the stock, which has risen 22 percent this year, closed 6.9 percent higher today than Friday's close. 
The revival of Korea, under court receivership when Hyundai submitted the winning bid in the court's third attempt at auctioning it off in October 1998, reflects the determination of the Hyundai automotive group to compete on a global scale with the giants of the United States, Japan and Europe. Now in control of 75 percent of the South Korean market, the Hyundai automotive group has roared ahead of its closest competitor, Daewoo Motor, which filed for bankruptcy in 1999 and has been floundering during prolonged takeover negotiations with General Motors.
G.M. is reported to be in the final phase of negotiations with Daewoo creditors, led by the government-owned Korea Development Bank, to take over Daewoo Motor on the basis of a memorandum of understanding signed in September.
One factor in the rise of the Hyundai automotive group has been its complete withdrawal from the rest of the Hyundai group, once Korea's largest chaebol, or conglomerate. Avoiding demands to invest in other Hyundai companies, Hyundai automotive has streamlined operations under Chung Mong Koo, eldest son of the Hyundai group's founder, Chung Ju Yung, who died last year.
Hyundai's only other Korean competitor is Renault-Samsung, introduced as Samsung Motor in the middle of the economic crisis in 1998 and later taken over by Renault. Renault-Samsung had 1.7 percent of the Korean market last year.

HEADLINE: Asia Markets Are Higher; Europe Is Off 

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Stock markets around the world were mixed yesterday, with shares moving higher in Asia but lower in Europe. United States markets were closed for Washington's Birthday.
 The dollar recouped early losses against the yen yesterday, after President Bush said he and Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi of Japan had discussed devaluation. White House officials quickly said that Mr. Bush had misspoken and that he had meant to say the two leaders had talked about deflation. 
 The dollar bought 132.66 yen, down 0.08 yen from late on Friday in Tokyo but above its late New York level of 132.60 yen on Friday. In other currencies, the euro was traded at 115.92 yen, up from 115.85 yen late on Friday in Tokyo.
The blue-chip 225-issue Nikkei stock average rose 45.15 points, or 0.45 percent, to close at 10,093.25. On Friday, the average fell 32.99 points, or 0.33 percent. 
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index rose 40.93, to 11,02.81.
In London, stocks finished slightly lower, with the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closing down 28.20 at 5154.30. In Paris, the CAC 40 index was down 29.95 at 4347.05, while the Ibex 35 index in Madrid fell 88, to 7832.40.
In commodities trading, Brent crude from the North Sea for April delivery fell 31 cents, to $20.56 a barrel, on the International Petroleum Exchange in London.
Gold closed in London at $297.50 bid per troy ounce, down from $300.40 on Friday. Silver closed in London at $4.52 bid per troy ounce, down from $4.60.
In recent months, Japanese officials have sat by while the yen has fallen in value against the dollar. Tokyo's lack of concern for a weakening yen has prompted calls from Asian leaders and United States corporate executives, who say the currency shift unfairly gives Japanese exporters a competitive advantage. A weaker yen usually helps Japanese exporters because it lowers the price of their products in overseas markets and bolsters profits when converted from foreign currencies.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE FIGHTING; 
In a Shift, U.S. Uses Airstrikes To Help Kabul

BYLINE:  By JOHN F. BURNS 

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan, Feb. 18 

 BODY:
American forces appear to have opened a new phase in the war in Afghanistan with two bombing raids over the weekend that Afghan commanders in the area said were aimed at clashing militia forces rather than the Taliban or Al Qaeda. 
 A statement on Sunday by the United States Central Command said American aircraft dropped precision-guided bombs when "enemy troops" attacked forces loyal to the eight-week-old Kabul government near the southeastern city of Khost on Saturday afternoon. The command said a second strike was carried out on Sunday, again with precision-guided bombs. 
 The strikes appeared to differ from previous American bombing raids in Afghanistan because, according to warlords in the region, they were aimed at controlling clashes among militia forces, and not at destroying the Taliban or Al Qaeda, the focus of American attacks since the first bombing raids on Oct. 7. If there have been earlier bombing raids on targets other than the Taliban and Al Qaeda, United States forces have not announced them. 
Although the details of the local militia clashes remained murky, the bombing raids seemed to have placed the United States for the first time in a position of using American air power in defense of the government of Hamid Karzai, the pro-American leader of the new administration in Kabul. After fighting broke out between rival warlords in northern and eastern Afghanistan in recent weeks, Mr. Karzai said he would request American airstrikes if they were needed to end clashes between armed factions that control much of Afghanistan outside Kabul.
American policy since the Taliban's collapse has been to offer strong political and economic support to the Karzai government, which took office in late December with a mandate to guide Afghanistan through the first six months of a 30-month transition to elections.
The United States also played a supporting role in establishing the British-led, 17-nation multinational force that helps provide security for the Karzai government in Kabul. 
But 4,000 American ground troops in Afghanistan have remained apart from that effort, focused on the pursuit of the Taliban and Al Qaeda.
American policy has aimed at achieving political stability under the Karzai government without the kind of major international military commitment that it supported in recent years in Bosnia and Kosovo. In both of those cases, Western-led international military contingents that included large components of American soldiers were deployed, involving tens of thousands of troops. 
The international force in Kabul is building to a manpower ceiling of 4,700 troops, with only a handful of American liaison officers, and has a mandate that limits it to the area immediately around Kabul.
Up to now, American commanders have insisted on keeping their focus on the drive against the Taliban and Al Qaeda. That effort is far from over, Gen. Richard B. Myers, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said today in New Delhi.
"It's just the beginning," he told reporters, adding that American forces still had to "capture some of the leadership" of the two groups and "try to make the situation more secure." 
Officials of other Western nations who favor an expansion of the multinational force, along with top United Nations officials who have argued for extending the force across the country, say American officials have expressed concerns about the international troops getting caught in a civil war if the Karzai government fails to rein in the warlords.
But events in recent days, including the assassination of a Karzai government minister at the Kabul airport and renewed tribal clashes in the east and the north, have raised new doubts about the stability of the interim government, and about its ability to extend its authority beyond Kabul without increased international military support. 
Mr. Karzai said on Sunday that he would ask for more international support if unrest continued. 
"If the security situation in Afghanistan does not improve further, we will make sure the international security forces are asked, together with the Afghan forces, to take a stronger role," Mr. Karzai said at a news conference where he discussed the murder of Abdul Rahman, the aviation and tourism minister, as well as the tribal clashes. 
He added, "I will ask for every measure to bring security to the Afghan people. I will use international forces, Afghan forces, to make life good for these people. There is no way we will let Afghanistan go the way of the past. The gunrunners, those guys who think they can get away with murder, those days are over."
Obtaining facts about the weekend fighting and airstrikes was complicated by the lack of reliable sources in the area.
According to the Central Command statement, "pro-government forces" requested the raids after "enemy troops" fired on them as they attempted to pass a roadblock. The statement gave no details on the identity of the pro-government forces or the enemy troops.
But Afghan commanders in the area said the incident evolved from a clash between two local forces that did not involve the Taliban or Al Qaeda. Abdul Wali Zadran, a brother of Padsha Khan Zadran, a warlord in the region, said today that the clashes involved two tribal militias, one from the Kochi clan and the other from the Gorboz clan, about 20 miles east of Khost. He said the American bombing that followed had killed one fighter from the pro-government forces and wounded four others. 
The Khost region is one of many in the country that rival warlords have divided into armed fiefs.
Padsha Khan Zadran and another warlord, Zakim Khan Zadran, who have similar names and are from the same tribe but share no family relationship, have carved out separate strongholds in the region.
Both men have professed support for the Karzai government, and have competed for support from a small contingent of American troops based at Khost airport in support of the hunt for the Taliban and Al Qaeda. Both men have recruited tribal fighters who previously served with the Taliban. 
A report on Saturday by the Afghan Islamic Press, a private news agency with a credible record of reporting on Afghan fighting, said the bombing came when pro-Karzai forces sought to stop the tribal fighting.
But it was not clear whether the tribal militias were allied to the feuding warlords in Khost or whether they were fighting for other reasons. 
In another sign of the Pentagon's growing involvement in direct support for Mr. Karzai's government, Maj. Gen. Charles Campbell, the chief of staff of the United States Central Command, arrived in Kabul today to begin a mission to train a new Afghan Army, The Associated Press reported. 
Mr. Karzai's concerns were compounded today by a warning from the fugitive Taliban interior minister, Mullah Abdul Razzak, who was interviewed by Reuters at a hideout near Spinbaldak, on the Pakistan border about 80 miles from Kandahar. He said the Taliban would "soon resume our activities" in response to popular discontent over the lawlessness.

HEADLINE: Workers Held Hostage 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Does life imitate art, or what? Last weekend's box office was dominated by a movie in which Denzel Washington takes an emergency room hostage to secure treatment for his dying son. Last week's major political event, though it went largely unnoticed by the general public, was also a hostage drama: House Republicans blocked vital aid to the nation's most vulnerable workers, and have refused to release it unless they secure passage of a dying stimulus plan. The plan, you won't be surprised to learn, consists almost entirely of tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy.
 Here's how the blackmail scheme works. U.S. unemployment insurance, unlike benefits in many other advanced countries, has a sharp cutoff: 26 weeks and you're out. This cutoff can be rationalized as tough love; arguably the American system, by giving workers no choice other than to find new jobs, has helped prevent the emergence of a European-style class of permanent unemployed. But it's a very harsh rule to impose during recessions, when new jobs are simply not available. 
 And that's the current situation. Last week 80,000 workers reached the end of their benefits; the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates that two million workers will have exhausted their insurance by June.
Fortunately, in practice the rule is relaxed in hard times. When recession strikes, Congress invariably acts to extend unemployment benefits. During last fall's stimulus debate, everyone favored a 13-week extension. True, both sides tried to tie that extension to other measures. But everyone expected that in the end Congress would extend benefits whatever the status of other stimulus proposals. Indeed, the Senate passed an extension by unanimous voice vote.
But the hard men of the House leadership refuse to allow a clean vote on unemployment benefits. Instead they continue to insist that it's their way or no way: they won't allow a vote on benefits extension except as part of a bill that mainly consists of tax cuts for corporations and families in upper tax brackets, pretty much identical to the failed stimulus bills of the fall. And they rammed that bill through last Thursday.
Let's leave aside, for a moment, the economic merits of those tax cuts. What's really striking about this tactic is its sheer bloody-mindedness: the House leadership is willing to impose pain on some of the most vulnerable people in the country, desperate families whose breadwinners have been unable to find jobs, in order to push a divisive, partisan agenda.
And for what it's worth, that agenda is also bad economics. Last month the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reviewed a range of potential stimulus measures, including all the elements in the latest House bill. Sure enough, the bill consists largely of the very measures -- accelerated tax cuts for upper brackets, reductions in the alternative minimum tax on corporations -- that the C.B.O. concluded would be least effective. 
What these proposed tax cuts have in common, of course, is that they deliver not a penny of relief to the great majority of American families.
But isn't the House leadership's behavior just politics as usual? No, it isn't. Politics as usual is trying to attach goodies for yourself to bills that provide goodies to other people. Everyone does that. But extending unemployment insurance in a recession is so standard -- and refusing to do so is so cruel -- that the House action takes the tax-cut crusade to a whole new level of fanaticism.
Put it this way: At first, ordinary workers were told that they would benefit directly from lower taxes -- remember those "tax families"? Great effort was devoted to obscuring the simple truth that last year's tax cut offered crumbs for ordinary families, but huge breaks for the wealthy.
Then ordinary workers were told that they should support bills like the two House stimulus plans from the fall -- bills that offered retroactive tax cuts to corporations, big tax breaks to families with high incomes, and nothing at all to two-thirds of the population -- because those bills would create jobs. After all, tax cuts are part of the war on terrorism, or something. 
But now tax-cut advocates have moved from promises to threats. Support tax cuts for the elite, the House leadership says, or we'll cut off your unemployment benefits.
So what's next? Support tax cuts or we'll break your legs?

HEADLINE: Tougher Policies on Refugees 

 BODY:
Today 35 million people worldwide are fleeing war or persecution. The last time the number was this high, World War II was raging. Yet many countries are hardening their refugee policies. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees must cut its services -- which already fall far short of the need -- by 10 percent because contributions from the European Union have dropped. Even as wealthy countries cut back their financing for food, health and education in refugee camps, they are also taking in fewer people. Nations like the United States, Denmark and Australia, historically open to the persecuted, are now closing the doors. 
 Refugees are less popular than ever because of post-Sept. 11 security worries. But the concern is misguided; only the most incompetent terrorist would try to enter a Western nation as a refugee. A tiny percentage of refugees are accepted and the process takes years, much of that time spent living in a squalid camp. In addition, refugees coming to America have always undergone far more thorough background checks than people entering on student, tourist or business visas. 
 Australia's shift has aroused the most controversy, because it was so blatantly -- and successfully -- a campaign device for Prime Minister John Howard's center-right Liberal Party. Mr. Howard sent asylum seekers, mainly those fleeing Afghanistan and Iraq, to neighboring countries for temporary detention and then tightened asylum laws. Mr. Howard is now under attack for campaign statements asserting that heartless refugees had been throwing their children overboard. He acknowledges that this was untrue but said he believed it at the time. 
Sadly, Australia is not alone. Well before Sept. 11 European countries were tightening border controls, aiming to keep people out so they cannot even ask for asylum. One reason for the shift is that conservative parties are winning power and anti-immigrant parties have gained support.
Denmark is one example. The new center-right leadership, pushed by an anti-foreigner party that has doubled its parliamentary representation, has promised to limit the number of foreigners in the country. This is especially important because Denmark is to assume the rotating six-month presidency of the European Union later this year, and will have a strong influence over Europe's refugee policies.
In the United States, each year the president sets a maximum number of refugees America will accept. The figure has been declining for the last 20 years -- it is now 70,000, down from 200,000 in the mid-1980's. Priorities for entry are still tilted toward the cold war -- one of the largest groups admitted, for example, is Jews from the former Soviet Union, not among those in the most dire need today. In addition, the number of refugees accepted is always less than the ceiling, a policy some compare to launching lifeboats from the Titanic with some seats empty. After Sept. 11, refugee resettlement essentially stopped as increased security measures were put in place. It has restarted, but at a much slower pace. While the transition to more security should be temporary, the continuing degradation of protections for refugees is not. 
Taking in refugees may not be popular in hard economic times, but it is the right thing to do. Moreover, prosperous countries like the United States and Australia have found that refugees and their children can become among their most devoted and productive citizens. Western nations more and more are adopting the view that refugees are not victims in need of sanctuary but a political problem to be solved by keeping them anywhere but here.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE VICE PRESIDENT; 
Cheney, at Marine Base, Reinforces Bush's Stand On War Against Terror

BYLINE:  By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: MARINE CORPS AIR STATION, MIRAMAR, Calif., Feb. 18 

 BODY:
Vice President Dick Cheney opened a four-day campaign-style swing through California today by underscoring America's resolve to stop Iraq, Iran and North Korea from continuing to develop or pursue nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.
 In a speech to 2,500 marines at this sprawling base north of San Diego, Mr. Cheney defended President Bush's decision to single out those three countries as an "axis of evil," defining a new phase in Washington's war against terror. Some allies have criticized Mr. Bush's language. 
 "The president's remarks caused a certain amount of hand-wringing in some quarters, but most Americans find it reassuring to have a commander in chief who tells the truth and who means exactly what he says," Mr. Cheney said.
"The United States will not permit terror states and their terrorist allies to threaten us with weapons of mass destruction," he said, speaking on the flight line in front of a CH-53E Super Stallion helicopter and F/A-18 Hornet fighter, two Marine Corps workhorses in the war in Afghanistan.
The vice president's remarks echoed those he made last week to the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington. But his words today took on added pungency as he addressed and then mingled over lunch with members of the Third Marine Aircraft Wing in their camouflage-green fatigues.
Nine marines stationed here were killed in two aircraft crashes in Afghanistan last month, and family members of some of them sat in the front row today for Mr. Cheney's Presidents Day speech.
Next month, Mr. Cheney is scheduled to visit 12 allied and Middle East countries in what is widely viewed as an effort to build support for toppling President Saddam Hussein of Iraq through the use of tougher economic penalties, covert operations, and, possibly, military force.
To wage the war on terror, Mr. Cheney, a former secretary of defense, said today that the administration's proposed $48 billion increase in Pentagon spending for 2003, the military's largest annual budget increase in 20 years, would help ensure that America's armed forces had "the best weapons, the best equipment and the best training."
The visit to California marks Mr. Cheney's first major trip since the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, and his longest official foray outside of Washington as vice president.
For several months, Mr. Cheney has rarely been seen in public, working at the presidential retreat at Camp David, Md., or at an undisclosed location outside Washington.
But aides say he has not been to one of his secluded hideaways in more than two weeks, another sign that the administration is taking the wraps off a man who many in government and the political world believe is the most powerful vice president in the nation's history.
While in California, the vice president will focus on defense and economic issues. He plans to give a speech on national security at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library in Yorba Linda, visit farmers in Fresno and tour a high-technology site in San Jose. On Tuesday night, he will appear on the NBC program "The Tonight Show with Jay Leno."
"California is a one-stop shop for our big messages," said Mary Matalin, Mr. Cheney's senior political adviser.
But Mr. Cheney's visit also has a distinctly partisan political purpose: to pump up state Republican coffers and to rally party faithful before a three-way gubernatorial primary on March 5 to pick a candidate to challenge Gov. Gray Davis, the Democratic incumbent.
On Tuesday night, Mr. Cheney will dine with some of the state's wealthiest Republican donors at a private, $25,000-a-couple fund-raiser in Los Angeles that is expected to rake in more than $1 million for the state party. Later in the week, he will raise money for two House Republicans, Richard W. Pombo and John T. Doolittle.
Aides say Mr. Cheney will make at least 60 campaign appearances, mostly in House contests, between now and the Nov. 5 elections.
Earlier this month, Mr. Cheney raised money for three other House Republicans in tight races, John Hostettler of Indiana, and Anne M. Northup and Edward Whitfield, both of Kentucky.
"Cheney is returning to one of the traditional roles of the vice president, which is to carry a large share of the political load during the mid-term elections," said Rich Bond, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee.

HEADLINE: Bush Affirms U.S. Role in Asia in New 'Pacific Century' 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Tuesday, Feb. 19 

 BODY:
Declaring that the next 100 years would be the "Pacific Century," President Bush strongly reaffirmed the role of the American military in Asia during a speech today to the Japanese Parliament.
 The United States, Mr. Bush said, would stop aggression against South Korea, show "American power and purpose" in support of the Philippines, maintain its commitments to Taiwan and press forward with a missile defense system. 
 "America, like Japan, is a Pacific nation, drawn by trade and values and history to be a part of Asia's future," Mr. Bush said. "We stand more committed than ever to a forward presence in this region." 
Mr. Bush, who spoke toward the end of a two-day visit to Japan during a three-nation Asian tour, also powerfully endorsed what he called the economic reforms of Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. Mr. Bush even likened Mr. Koizumi to a star of American baseball, Ichiro Suzuki of the Seattle Mariners. "The prime minister can hit anything you throw at him," Mr. Bush said.
But in a subtle reprimand suggesting that Mr. Koizumi had not done all he could to restructure an economy that is veering toward crisis, Mr. Bush said that forceful action was needed immediately. He held up the American response to its savings and loan crisis and its earlier economic troubles as a model.
"As we made reforms, foreign investors regained faith in us, especially investors from Japan," Mr. Bush said. "We learned that in times of crisis and stagnation, it is better to move forward boldly with reform and restructuring than to wait, hoping that old practices will somehow work again. Through bold action, we emerged a better and stronger economy, and so will you."
At the same time, Mr. Bush extravagantly praised Japan for its support of the campaign against terrorism and said the world's two largest economies had successfully joined together to oppose aggression. Mr. Bush cited the logistical support provided by Japan's Self Defense Forces and its aid to Afghanistan, and said the United States and Japan were working together to find and disrupt terrorist cells. He also praised Japan for its advances in energy and medicine.
"Japan is making these great contributions even in a time of economic uncertainty and transition that has caused some to question whether your nation can maintain these commitments and your leadership in the world," he said. "I have no such questions, and I am confident that Japan's greatest era lies ahead."
Mr. Bush's reference to the Pacific Century was a revival of a phrase used more often in the early 1990's, when Japan was economically ascendant, and in contrast to the Century of the Americas theme that Mr. Bush had promoted during his 2000 presidential campaign.
After his speech, Mr. Bush and Laura Bush had lunch with Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko at the Imperial Palace, the former seat of the Tokugawa shoguns who ruled Japan for more than 250 years. 
Mr. Bush has spent much of his two days in Tokyo, a city he last visited in 1975, partaking of his surroundings like the world's most exclusive tourist. He and Mrs. Bush stayed at the luxurious, Moorish-style residence of the American ambassador, Howard Baker, and his wife, Nancy Kassebaum Baker. On Monday night, the Bakers, the Bushes and Mr. Koizumi broke away from the usual formal banquet held on such visits and had dinner at Gonpachi, a trendy new restaurant that is so enormous that the Japanese food cognoscenti refer to it as a theme park.
Mr. Bush ate the best of the nation's cuisine: yakitori, or grilled chicken; tempura; Kobe beef with tamari soy sauce; and a traditional egg custard, chawan mushi, with king crab and scallops. 
Mr. Bush has seemed to revel in Tokyo, particularly on this unusually brilliant day when the snow-covered slopes of Mount Fuji were visible behind the city's skyscrapers. He is clearly enjoying his role as a powerful American president shoring up an ailing Japanese economy.
In a joint news conference on Monday, Mr. Bush repeated that he wanted to keep "all options on the table" with Iraq, one of the nations he has called part of his "axis of evil." But he also said that he wanted "to resolve all issues peacefully, whether it be Iraq, Iran or North Korea."
But while Mr. Koizumi endorsed Mr. Bush's tough words, he was more conciliatory toward North Korea, saying his nation, "through cooperation and coordination with the U.S. and South Korea, would like to work on normalizing our relationship with North Korea."
After the lunch at the Imperial Palace, Mr. Bush left Tokyo for South Korea, where anti-American protesters have demonstrated and occupied the American Chamber of Commerce. He is to travel to the demilitarized zone on Wednesday, and visit China on Thursday and Friday.

HEADLINE: Tentatively, North Korea Solicits Foreign Investment and Tourism 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: ONJUNG-RI, North Korea 

 BODY:
The display cases are in place, the tourists are here, their wallets filled with American dollars. Only the perfumes, whiskey and cigarettes are lacking to open the first duty-free shops in North Korea.
 One hurdle remains to foreign investment. "If we sell $1 million a month, how do we get the money out?" Thakor P. Sharma said from Singapore when asked about the delay in opening his nine duty-free shops across North Korea. He expects to resolve the money-transfer issue this spring says he urges his North Korean negotiators to keep politics to one side, lecturing them that "money talks." 
 A new language of foreign investment, trade and tourism is filtering into North Korea, long written off as a granite-hard bastion of communism. Over the last 18 months, this "hermit nation" has gone on line with an e-mail service and signed its first onshore oil concession with a foreign company. In the months before North Korea became a charter member of President Bush's "axis of evil," this long-reclusive nation established diplomatic ties with 14 Western nations. 
Although President Bill Clinton eased most restrictions on trade and investment with North Korea in June 2000, large American companies shied away from conducting business after efforts to establish diplomatic ties foundered at the end of the Clinton administration. Although Americans are free to travel to North Korea, President Bush has taken a hard line, arguing that the nation's missile exports and biological warfare capabilities are a threat to the United States.
 On Tuesday, Mr. Bush arrives in Seoul for a two-day visit to South Korea. On Monday, in Tokyo, he starkly contrasted the divided halves of Korea, saying at a news conference: "On the one side of a parallel, we've got people starving to death, because a nation chooses to build weapons of mass destruction. And the other side, there's freedom." 
 Last Friday, Mr. Bush said that if North Korea stopped exporting missiles, "we would welcome trade." In an interview with a Seoul paper, Joongang Ilbo, he added: "We would help welcome North Korea into the family of nations, and all the benefits, which would be trade and commerce and exchanges." 
This year, North Korea will get limited cellphone and Internet service and hold an arts festival and three trade fairs. It will also have a modern hotel, partly foreign-owned, open in Pyongyang, the capital -- all to attract foreigners.
"They are after tourism," said Nick Bonner, whose company, Koryo Tours, is offering package tours from Beijing for $1,590. After Mr. Bush lumped North Korea with Iran and Iraq as forces of evil, Mr. Bonner predicted that Americans would not be issued visas to attend the arts festival.
"North Korea has no choice," said Bradley O. Babson, a Washington economist who has studied North Korea for the World Bank. Referring to the end of communist ideology in China and Russia, he explained: "The neighborhood has become market-oriented."
With China's booming economy exerting a growing influence on North Korea, direct flights are to start next month linking Pyongyang with Dalian and Shenyang, two commercial centers an hour away by jet.
At the prodding of Russia, North Korea's largest creditor, plans are advancing for two big projects: a $250 million upgrade of the main rail line to allow goods to be shipped from Seoul to Europe, and a natural gas pipeline to link Siberian gas fields with South Korea.
North Korea may hold the key, but South Korea is the prize. South Korea has about 48 million people -- more than twice as many as North Korea -- and its economy, the 13th largest in the world, is 25 times as big. South Korean auto workers produce as many vehicles in two eight-hour shifts as North Korea turns out in a year.
After losing Soviet subsidies in the late 1980's, North Korea's economy contracted by about half, and its debt soared to around $12.5 billion. It is now heavily dependent on food and oil donations from the United States, South Korea and Japan.
But investment is trickling in. This spring, work is to start on a 2,317-square-mile oil exploration and production concession in North Korea, won last fall by Sovereign Ventures of Singapore. In July, cellphone service is to start under a joint venture of Loxley Pacific of Thailand and North Korea's telecommunications ministry. Human rights groups are proposing that foreign companies follow a code of conduct similar to the Sullivan principles that prepared South Africa for a post-apartheid society.
"I saw some Americans of Korean origin looking at oil and gas prospects," said Glyn Ford, a British member of the European Parliament who was in Pyongyang last summer for the opening of the British embassy. Given North Korea's power shortages and rundown ports, he said: "At the moment, very cheap labor is the only thing the North Koreans have going for them."
With more and more delegations traveling to Pyongyang, the number of foreign companies at this May's trade fair is expected to be triple last year's level. Two new fairs will be held this year, one sponsored by the European Union, one focused on information technology.
"Business people are feeling more comfortable now that the diplomatic platform is in place," said Roger Barrett, managing director of Foreign Business Development Associates, a Beijing company that took seven groups to North Korea last year. Mr. Barrett, a Briton who plans to open an office in the North Korean capital in April, said: "When you go around the office buildings in Pyongyang, you would be surprised by the number of European and Asian companies. There are about 20 or 30."
In 2000, most restrictions on American trade, travel and investment were lifted. John J. Schwartz, a vice president at Wente Vineyards of California, said the business mood he encountered recently in Pyongyang reminded him of market openings in Russia, Vietnam and Cambodia.
"In each newly developed market, they see capitalism as a fast buck," said Mr. Schwartz, who plans to sell wines in Mr. Sharma's duty-free shops. "It's always great to be the pioneer, the maverick -- but they are the ones that often get burned."
While visiting executives may be heartened to find a DHL counter in their Pyongyang hotel, the pitfalls of being a pioneer can be seen in this tourist enclave 130 miles to the southeast.
From the docks of a nearby seaport, four miles of freshly laid railroad tracks lead to a modern mineral water bottling plant. Its clean lines, robin's-egg-blue walls and red trim stand out amid the drab decay of the countryside. In 2000, the Taechang Company of South Korea, spent $12 million to build the plant and the railway.
But after a successful year, North Korea changed the rules, demanding a 30-fold jump in its cut of the cash flow.
"We couldn't make both ends meet," said Kong Soon Hyoung, the assistant manager, so the plant has suspended operations.
Nearby, the Hyundai Asan Corporation's Mount Kumgang tourism project limps into its fourth year. After losing roughly $300 million, Hyundai won South Korean government subsidies in January to keep tours running through this year. Fewer than 4,000 tourists, or 10 percent of the goal, come here each month by cruise ship from South Korea. Hyundai says it will never make money if tourists cannot come by bus.
"Road access would change a lot," said Kim Han-Soo, Hyundai's manager, as tourists shopped for handicrafts. By road, this mountain resort, seven miles north of the demilitarized zone, would be five hours from the greater Seoul-Inchon region, home to 20 million people. A duty-free shop, a golf course and skiing would also help.
In its first two years, Mount Kumgang provided North Korea with foreign exchange equal to 20 percent of its exports. But North Korea still failed to live up to its promise to allow road access, and now Hyundai is $1.2 million behind in payments to the north.
Hyundai's losses have scared away many investors. In a poll last summer, 88 percent of 600 South Korean companies said they had no plans to do business in the north.
To ease tensions, South Korean President Kim Dae Jung seeks to weave business links. Last year South Korea published a 250-page English-language "North Korea Business Factbook." Easing inter-Korean tensions has more than sentimental appeal. South Korean officials admit that it is an inexpensive insurance policy to calm investors, contributing to the $50 billion that has flowed into South Korea since 1997.
"There are over 125 South Korean firms doing business in North Korea," said Donald P. Gregg, president of the Korea Society in New York. "They find it difficult to get through the bureaucracy. Once they do, they find the North Korean workers literate, hard workers and excellent value."
While the Bush administration takes a confrontational approach, other nations are building a web of trade and investment ties. Last July, Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss engineering group, opened an office in Pyongyang to support its contracts to modernize electric distribution.
Working from a Chinese border town, Thomas Payne, another Californian, has sold chili peppers and T-shirts printed in English to North Koreans. His advice? "North Koreans are good people, but always get paid in advance," he said.
With the trade, aid, investment, schools and roughly 200 Westerners now living in Pyongyang comes a more liberalized way of thinking.
Controls are bad for business, Mr. Sharma frets into the phone from Singapore. Worried about future traffic through his duty-free stores, he suggests that the police should just loosen up. With three shops under construction near North Korea's land borders, he said: "We need a couple of hundred people a day, not just a couple of dozen."

HEADLINE: Cuomo, the Sequel; 
A Son Seeks to Remake Himself, but in His Own Image

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
Andrew M. Cuomo has served as a member of the cabinet of President Bill Clinton. He managed his father's first campaign to become governor of New York. He spent a year as a senior adviser to Mario M. Cuomo, working out of a vast office in the State Capitol. At the age of 44, Mr. Cuomo has worked as a lawyer and as an assistant district attorney in Manhattan, and has created a program to provide housing for the homeless.
 But throughout his career, there are two things that Mr. Cuomo has not done: He has never before run for office himself. And, other than the brief stints as his father's $1-a-year adviser and as an assistant prosecutor, he had never held a position inside the governments of New York City or the state. 
 As the younger Mr. Cuomo gathers himself up now to attempt to defeat the man who forced his father out of public life eight years ago, that lack of experience -- along with the sense among some Democrats that Mr. Cuomo has descended upon New York after six years in Washington and immediately grabbed for the top rung of the ladder -- has emerged as an obstacle that many Democrats and Republicans argue Mr. Cuomo needs to overcome. 
Mr. Cuomo is in a Democratic primary against H. Carl McCall, the state comptroller who has a sweep of experience in state government and the admiration of much of his party's establishment. And Mr. Cuomo is running at a time of anxiety and fiscal turmoil, in a state reeling from a terrorist attack, a political environment that is likely to put a premium on maturity and experience. It is hardly a coincidence that Gov. George E. Pataki has taken to referring diminutively to the younger Cuomo, who has always called himself "Andrew," as simply "Andy."
If Mr. Cuomo is worried about any of this, he is not showing it. Brash, ambitious, and hungry for victory, Mr. Cuomo, the former United States housing secretary, is methodically remaking himself as he approaches this race, with an agility that recalls Mario M. Cuomo's skills. It is not that he is not experienced, Mr. Cuomo explains patiently in laying out his campaign. It is that he is the outsider offering reform to a political culture -- the government in Albany -- that Mr. Cuomo argues has become "institutionally corrupt."
"This race will come to be about change versus the status quo," Mr. Cuomo declared, sitting in his downtown law firm office with a view of New York Harbor at his back. "If you feel comfortable with the way things are going, and you're happy with the current trajectory, then vote for the status quo: 'I want four years like the last four years.' George Pataki. Or McCall."
"I just see the situation fundamentally differently than they do," Mr. Cuomo said, adding, "The system has to be fundamentally changed. This is not about incremental shifts. The culture of Albany, the performance of Albany, is fundamentally flawed."
At a factory in Rochester last week, Mr. Cuomo declared: "They are consumed with their own personal politics, and they've forgotten the public interest."'
It is a campaign appeal that, right down to the specifics of its change versus status quo language, is almost identical to the one that Mr. Clinton used in his campaign against George Bush in 1992. Mr. Cuomo describes Mr. Clinton as a "good friend," and leaves little doubt that he intends to ride on Mr. Clinton's residual coattails in the state that the former president now calls home.
Still, Mr. Cuomo may find himself constrained in the extent to which he can run against the Albany establishment, given the 16 years his own father served as lieutenant governor and governor. While not disputing Mr. Cuomo's argument about the depth of dysfunctionality in New York State's government, Democrats and Republicans suggest it really has not changed much, if at all, since Mr. Cuomo moved out.
And no matter how he presents himself, Mr. Cuomo faces an opponent, in Mr. McCall, who is perceived as paying as many dues -- from comptroller to state senator to head of the New York City school board -- as Mr. Cuomo has not. Representative Charles E. Rangel, the Harlem Democrat who is one of Mr. McCall's prominent supporters, said Mr. Cuomo's resume was rather scant, and suggested that Mr. Cuomo might step aside this time to run under Mr. McCall for lieutenant governor.
"I really don't see anything beyond the secretary of HUD and the Dad," Mr. Rangel said. "I think in fairness to my party, I should give him a chance to run the string out and see where he thinks it's going to go.
"But quite frankly, it's my hope that he might take his youth and build on his need for experience and seek to run for lieutenant governor," he continued. "It would seem to me that even people who are not supporting him would believe that that, in some sense, would be paying dues and showing that he does not want to weaken our chances winning the gubernatorial race, which would be very difficult for any of our candidates anyway. And having a primary doesn't help us."
Mr. Cuomo said, with a flick of his hand, that he saw no circumstances in which he would drop out, and he rejected those criticisms. "I believe I have more experience and qualifications than most people who run for the office, period," Mr. Cuomo said. "I have experiences that you just don't have on a statewide level."
Mr. Cuomo's aides later released information comparing Mr. Cuomo's former Washington office with Mr. McCall's, noting, for example, that the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development had a payroll of 10,000 people compared to 2,300 in the comptroller's office, and that Mr. Cuomo administered a budget of $34 billion compared with $221 million for the comptroller's office.
He added: "And we don't take turns, because this is not about my turn or your turn. We don't make decisions in the back room in the Democratic Party."
Indeed, Mr. Cuomo's aides asserted, he has been aggressively campaigning across New York, raising money at a faster pace than Mr. McCall, and in recent months winning such key endorsements as that of Steven Pigeon, the Erie County Democratic chairman. He also has been laying out the foundations of the campaign in much clearer terms than Mr. McCall has to date.
In his visit to Rochester last week, Mr. Cuomo said that upstate New York was "a Death Valley economically," arguing that its economy under Mr. Pataki had stagnated as the national economy under Mr. Clinton -- with Mr. Cuomo's assistance, according to Mr. Cuomo -- was roaring. Mr. Cuomo even came prepared with specific figures to show how much HUD assistance went to Rochester under Secretary Cuomo. ("I was looking at the numbers today: $150 million in federal aid came through HUD to Rochester and Monroe County while I was there," Mr. Cuomo said at a news conference.)
Secondly, in an interview, Mr. Cuomo attacked the slow pace of the development corporation appointed by Mr. Pataki to lay out plans for what to do with the World Trade Center site, and warned that the delay could endanger efforts to recover New York's downtown. "The window closes," Mr. Cuomo said. "And people are watching, and people are nervous."
But most of all, Mr. Cuomo said, the public education system would be his defining theme. "In terms of an issue that's going to illustrate what we're talking about -- changing the culture, changing the mentality, accountability, performance -- it's all going to be around education," Mr. Cuomo said.
Mr. Cuomo said that a large part of his plan would be changing the governance of the state's school systems, by giving the governor direct authority over education in New York; and he suggested, without saying outright, that he would support the bid by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg to persuade the Legislature to give the mayor direct control of the city's school system.
"Let's say hypothetically, I say the mayor has to be in control, the governor has to be in control," Mr. Cuomo said, using a hypothetical construction that was intended, he explained, to make sure that he does not divulge this early what he promised will be "a very big news story" in his campaign. That, he continued, would set him apart from the Democratic establishment, including Mr. McCall.
At this point, Mr. Cuomo's campaign manager, Josh D. Isay, interjected to inquire if this part of the interview was on the record. Informed that indeed it was, Mr. Cuomo settled back in his seat for a moment.
"If I were to say that,"' Mr. Cuomo said with a grin. "So this is a very big deal. There are some issues there that are so clear as to speak to the cultural shift. If I were to say I'm with Bloomberg, it would say you're against Democrats in Albany, literally all the Democrats in Albany, and you're pointing out Pataki's impotence on the issue because Pataki will say, 'I tried to do that, I failed for eight years.' "
But that was about as far as Mr. Cuomo would go, at least until later in this campaign, in detailing his ideas. "The state is responsible for the public education system," Mr. Cuomo said, fairly shouting in his office. "Fix it! The governor is like, 'It's not me, I'm not responsible, it's the Board of Regents. The regents say, 'It's not me, it's the chancellor.' Fix it!"
"Someone has to be in charge," Mr. Cuomo said. "I'm going to say, I run the public education system. If it's not reformed at the end of four years, fire me."
Similarly, when asked how he would change the system in Albany, Mr. Cuomo plunged again into murky waters. "I would start by doing things," he said. "Doing things. You want to change the culture? You want to start to get people to notice you and believe in you? Do something. Do something. You're not going to do it with words."
But clearly, most of Mr. Cuomo's attention these days is focused on leaders in Albany. He argued that Mr. Pataki had run a caretaker government, and that given the tenor of much of Mr. Pataki's time in office -- which was mostly a period of prosperity -- New Yorkers had little concern about what the state government was doing.
"Well, now things are not O.K.," Mr. Cuomo said. "That great Clinton economy is over. Now the tide has dropped and the rocks are showing, and it's ugly."
Then he continued, like a train rolling down the tracks: "And now you have these real security issues. And now people are starting to move out. And now people want some help. And when you now need something, and you look to Albany, what was a joke last year -- their level of dysfunction -- now is frightening."

HEADLINE: U.S.-China Tensions Ease Before Bush Trip 

BYLINE:  By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Feb. 18 

 BODY:
Given the tortuous recent history of Chinese-American relations, the atmosphere surrounding President Bush's visit to Beijing this Thursday and Friday is amazingly relaxed.
 American officials hope there will be progress in controlling the spread of weapons. They are pleased that China has agreed to a live broadcast of the leaders' news conference, to allow Mr. Bush to display his Texas charm to the masses. 
 The Chinese are likely to release a prominent dissident or two by way of a welcome gift. They seem willing to suppress their deepest fears about American intentions in Asia, instead celebrating their partnership against terrorism.
Small-bore agreements on the environment, energy, health care and trade may be signed with fanfare. But no one expects this visit -- by coincidence, exactly 30 years after President Nixon's stunning first meeting with Mao -- to yield major advances or ugly encounters.
Leaders on both sides are aware of the pitfalls that lie ahead, but they seem determined to cultivate cooperation where they can, in part as a bulwark against future clashes.
Chinese leaders worried as Mr. Bush took office that their country was becoming the new whipping boy of American foreign policy. That fear eased after Sept. 11, when it became clear that the United States had an overriding new global enemy.
"Sept. 11 changed the agenda of American foreign policy," said Wang Yong, executive director of the Center for International Political Economy at Beijing University. "China became a less important issue for the United States."
He said the underlying problems in Chinese-American relations had not disappeared. "But recent events have given the two countries some time," he said, "a chance to work toward stronger long-term relations."
Apart from the nasty surprises in recent years that have caused strains -- like the American bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade and the episode with an American spy plane -- each side retains serious concerns.
The Chinese worry that the Bush administration will tilt toward Taiwan and sell it ever more advanced arms. 
This week China, which continues to view Taiwan as a renegade province, is certain, at a minimum, to insist that Mr. Bush restate his fidelity to "one China." But the potentially explosive issue of arms sales will receive only passing reference, diplomats predict.
The Chinese wonder how temporary the surging American military presence in Asia will be, and they were frightened by Mr. Bush's declaration of an "axis of evil" consisting of Iraq, Iran and North Korea. They know that some Bush officials would not mind if the American plans for a national missile defense also served to neutralize China's nuclear forces.
The Americans are alarmed by what they say is China's failure to halt its exports of nuclear and missile technologies, and they are monitoring China's own military buildup. 
The yawning American trade deficit with China is a perennial issue, and President Bush has made it known that he will press China about religious oppression and legal rights.
Yet an image of friendship is being scripted for what is officially described as a "working visit," rather than a "summit meeting" with its required pageantry. For now, Washington and Beijing appear eager to nurture the good will and shared interests growing out of the war on terror and China's scheduled opening of markets as it enters the World Trade Organization.
By all accounts, China has supported American goals in Afghanistan and the effort to cool tensions between India and Pakistan because it wants to further its own interest against Muslim extremism as well as improve ties with the United States.
Chinese leaders have even swallowed their misgivings about the spread of American bases in the region, which some military experts here fear is part of a long-term plan to encircle and contain China.
China has agreed to permit the opening of an F.B.I. office here, diplomats say..
One factor driving China's cooperative stance these days is its desire to avoid foreign crises at a time of economic turmoil at home and imminent turnover in the national leadership, said Kenneth Lieberthal, who was a top adviser on Asia policy in the Clinton administration.
"Right now the Chinese are really looking to avoid external complications," Mr. Lieberthal said. "They are not out there looking for issues to express great outrage about."

HEADLINE: In a Merger Of Networkers, Ciena Will BuyONI Systems 

BYLINE:  By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH with SIMON ROMERO 

 BODY:
The Ciena Corporation, a maker of fiber optic network equipment, said yesterday that it would acquire ONI Systems, in a stock transaction worth $900 million. 
 The deal comes as telecommunications equipment suppliers struggle amid spending cutbacks by big carriers like Qwest Communications and WorldCom. Ciena and ONI executives, as well as analysts, said the merger might help Ciena and ONI market their products as the industry's deep recession persists. 
 While Ciena, based in Linthicum, Md., has focused on equipment for long-haul network operators, ONI's speciality is network equipment for use within metropolitan areas. 
"This will, hopefully, allow Ciena to sell a wider variety of equipment to its customers," said Mark Storm, an analyst at Frost & Sullivan in Norfolk, Va. "Of course, doing so depends on the overall recuperation of the industry."
Until now, Ciena has concentrated on supplying switching equipment and equipment for networks that send voice and data traffic across continents and oceans. But that market is weak because of an excess of network capacity built in the late 1990's by now-struggling companies like Global Crossing, Level 3 Communications and 360networks. 
ONI Systems, by contrast, makes specialized optical communications equipment for use in cities and densely populated suburban regions. Its products, which use tiny lasers and filters, increase the capacity of fiber optic strands by sending information with pulses of light, rather than electric current.
This metropolitan market is considered technically more complicated to reach than the long-haul telecommunications market. For that reason, it lagged behind the long-haul market in the late 90's but is considered healthier by some executives today. 
"When spending returns to the overall sector, it will return, first and foremost, to the metropolitan area," said Gary Smith, the president and chief executive of Ciena. He called the current downturn "an ideal time" for Ciena to reposition itself for an eventual rebound.
Mr. Smith predicted that prospective customers would do business more readily with a single, merged equipment manufacturer than with two smaller, separate companies that sold either long-haul or metropolitan area equipment. 
Although Ciena is a larger company than ONI, the stock of ONI has performed better than Ciena's this year. ONI's shares have declined 11.6 percent since the start of this year, closing up 19 cents on Friday at $5.54. Ciena's stock price has fallen 39 percent, closing at $8.73 on Friday, down 39 cents.
If the acquisition is approved by regulators and shareholders, each ONI share will be exchanged for 0.7104 share of Ciena, giving ONI stockholders ownership of about 24 percent of the combined company.
Ciena competes against a number of much larger companies, including Lucent Technologies, Nortel Networks and Alcatel.
After layoffs of some 380 factory workers in November, Ciena has about 3,500 employees. It was profitable in 2000 but lost money last year.
By contrast, ONI of San Jose, Calif., has never posted a profit since its incorporation in 1997. It introduced its first product in 2000 and has enjoyed rapid growth. But its expenses have significantly exceeded its revenue.
ONI's president and chief executive, Hugh Martin, said that the merger would help his company reduce marketing costs, while gaining credibility with the giant United States and European telephone companies that constitute its natural market. 
Without naming the companies, Mr. Martin said that four large, international carriers were currently testing ONI's equipment, and one of the big regional phone companies had notified ONI that it intended to make a purchase.
"They're very excited about the product, but they're also concerned about our ability to support that very high demand," Mr. Martin said. "They said ONI will have to train 1,000 people in two quarters if selected. You can imagine if a company our size had to train all those people in two quarters that would be a very ambitious task."

HEADLINE: New York Outside, and Rio in the Kitchen 

BYLINE:  By ELAINE LOUIE 

 BODY:
WHERE do New York City's nearly 12,000 Brazilians usually eat? Not, it seems, in the handful of Brazilian restaurants in the city.
 At Emporium Brasil on West 46th Street, 80 percent of the diners are Americans, said Regina Silva, one of the owners. The same is true for Churrascaria Plataforma on West 49th Street, where a largely American clientele comes for Brazilian barbecue, said Joao de Matos, an owner. 
 While many cultures, like the Chinese or the French, show off their most extraordinary food in restaurants, Brazilians save the most authentic, intensely seasoned dishes for home.
"Brazilians are not geared to eating Brazilian food out," said Cherie Y. Hamilton, an American who has lived in Brazil and is author of "Cuisines of Portuguese Encounters," (Hippocrene, 2001). 
Jorge Pontual, a reporter in New York for Rede Globo, the Brazilian television network, said, "Upper-class Brazilians go out to eat Italian, French, Japanese or Chinese foods, but not Brazilian."
In New York, Brazil's home-cooking tradition is perpetuated by people like Lia Gomes, 48, a housekeeper in Manhattan who came here 28 years ago from Recife, on Brazil's northeastern coast. Ms. Gomes has cooked since she was 14, when her mother insisted that she cook before she went to the beach. Once, she purposefully oversalted a dish, hoping her mother would say that she was such a bad cook she would never have to cook again.
"My mother said, 'Cook it again.' " Ms. Gomes said. Since that day, she said, "When I cook, I put my heart into it." 
One of her specialties is a flavorful fish stew. She sprinkles fresh lime juice and seasoned salt on sea bass steaks, fries them until they are golden, then simmers them for 10 minutes in a thick rich sauce of chopped tomatoes, onions, garlic, sweet red and green peppers, cilantro, tomato sauce and coconut milk.
Her fingers are nimble. She pats the steaks lovingly, as if she were caressing a child's cheek. As she chops the tomatoes, she seeds them simultaneously with a swift move of the thumb.
Brazilian cuisine is a mix of Portuguese influences -- like tomatoes, rice, dried salted codfish -- and African ones, with black beans, palm oil and okra. Indian, Italian and French ingredients and techniques also play into it. The food is not fiery, but every Brazilian cook has a glass jar of a smoldering pepper sauce, molho de pimenta, made of tiny red or green malagueta peppers steeped in olive oil. Vinegar and cachaca, a liquor distilled from sugar cane, are also added sometimes. Some cooks sprinkle the oil on every dish, making eating even scrambled eggs a tongue-smarting event. Brazilians keep pepper sauce for years, and replenish it with fresh oil, just as bakers hoard original starters for their breads.
At the Upper East Side home of Mr. Pontual, the television reporter, and his wife, Angela, cooking has become a team affair. Mrs. Pontual, who remembers helping her grandparents make sausage at their farm in Goias, a state in central Brazil, did all the family cooking until three years ago, when she became a writer and editor of Brazilian news at Bloomberg Television. Long days at work made her too tired to cook, so she became a speed cook.
She took a dish that normally takes a full day -- soaking black beans overnight, then cooking them with bay leaves and sausages for two hours -- and turned it into a fully flavored facsimile that takes 30 minutes.
The secret is a can of Goya black bean soup. Ms. Pontual cuts up bacon, linguica -- the Portuguese sausage -- and garlic, and sautes the meats and garlic. "Cook until it smells good," she said, pouring in the soup and a little water. She serves it with a pan-fried filet mignon and rice, Brazilian-style: garlic is sauteed in oil, the rice is added and stirred, like risotto, for five minutes before water and a sprinkle of salt are added. 
She also taught her husband how to cook. "I began when Angela stopped," Mr. Pontual said. "Traditionally, men don't cook. It's now glamorous for men to cook. It's considered to be something chic, and to know complicated dishes and to show off. " 
Each week, Mr. Pontual, who cooks not for glamour but to do his share of the work, makes one of his six favorite dishes, among them chicken and okra, pork tenderloin, or a muqueca, a stew of soft-shell crabs.
Cooking, of course, is an act of community. Michele Scheinkman, a family therapist in Manhattan originally from Rio de Janeiro, found herself lonely one recent night. Her husband, Jose, a professor of economics at Princeton, was teaching in Paris. Their only child, Andrei, was away at college. So she invited some friends over and cooked a classic Brazilian dish, a bacalhoada, or codfish stew. 
Ms. Scheinkman poured a little olive oil in a pot, and layered in slices of onions, potatoes, salted codfish that had soaked overnight, tomatoes, minced garlic, scallions, parsley and pitted calamata olives. After cooking for 25 minutes, what had looked like a dry though colorful dish became a bubbling casserole. The tomatoes and onions had given off their juices, which blended to a pale gold, speckled with bits of parsley. In the alchemy of cooking, the potatoes and the fish were perfectly, equally tender. It had the requisites of Brazilian home cooking -- soulful, hearty and flavorful. 
"When my husband calls me tomorrow, I will tell him that I miss him," Ms. Scheinkman said, "but if I can eat nice food with good friends, I'm not lonely."

HEADLINE: Across the Great Divide 

BYLINE:  By Dan Savage; Dan Savage is editor of The Stranger, a Seattle-based newsweekly.

DATELINE: SEATTLE 

 BODY:
When I went to Chicago for a wedding a few years ago, I decided to spare myself the agonies of air travel and take the train. I booked a first-class sleeping compartment on the Empire Builder, one of Amtrak's most historic trains, which travels more than 2,000 miles over the Cascades and across the Great Plains. Since then, I've taken the Empire Builder half a dozen times, and the stops along the way -- places like Havre, Mont., Minot, N.D., and Red Wing, Minn. -- have become for me more than abstractions on a map. 
 Traveling by train, I've spent time with people I would never have met otherwise. Once in Havre, I played poker at 8 o'clock in the morning with an elderly rancher I'd had dinner with on the train the night before. The Empire Builder makes an hourlong morning stop in Havre, and when I got out to stretch my legs, the rancher hurried over, grabbed my hand and asked if I would be so kind as to escort her to a small casino a few blocks from the station. She didn't want to go by herself, she explained, because it isn't ladylike to gamble alone so early in the morning. We talked politics at dinner the night before and in the casino that morning; she was a straight, pro-life Bush supporter, and I am a gay, pro-choice Gore voter -- and we got along famously. 
 Not everyone can afford the Empire Builder -- the time or the money. With stops, the trip takes about 46 hours, and for coach, the price is about $300 round trip. But a cost-benefit analysis is the wrong way to measure the value of train travel. The best justification for traveling by rail, and the best rationale for continuing its federal subsidy, is cultural.
After the last election there was a lot of talk about "red America" and "blue America," about the divide between the heartland and the coasts. The heartland, colored in red on the maps behind the network news anchor desk, was home to socially conservative Bush voters. Socially liberal Gore voters lived in big cities and on the blue-colored coasts.
Amtrak alone can't bring the reds and blues together. But trains like the Empire Builder provide a real, tangible link between small towns like Havre and big cities like Chicago. Flying tends to magnify the distance between places like Minot and Seattle, with planes swallowing up people in one urban area and burping them out in another. Traveling on the ground, you can see that the divide between red and blue, between urban and rural, isn't all that sharp. Rural fades into suburban, suburban into urban and back again.
Some have suggested that Amtrak's long-distance routes be transformed into the rail equivalent of luxury cruise ships. That's a poisonous idea. In the rural areas once served by Amtrak, there would be few travel options left, and while luxury trains might still pass through huge swaths of red America, they would be filled with wealthy tourists from blue America. Still, Amtrak lost $1.1 billion in 2001, its largest deficit ever, and it isn't going to be self-sufficient by the December 2002 deadline set by Congress five years ago. Amtrak has said it may eliminate as many as 18 long-distance trains if it doesn't receive at least $1.2 billion from Congress this year.
That's a substantial amount of money, I realize, even if it does occasionally bring together unlikely companions for a game of seven-card stud. But the federal government subsidizes airports to the tune of $13 billion a year and spends more than $30 billion on highways annually. In this context, $1.2 billion hardly seems excessive.
I know train travel doesn't make economic sense for everyone -- the bus is still the cheapest way to get from place to place, especially in red America -- and I harbor no illusions about its potential to bridge anything other than the Continental Divide. All I know is that I enjoy it, even learn from it, and that if more Americans would make time for the train, they might feel the same way.

HEADLINE: Construction of New Homes Rose By a Surprising 6.3% in January 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 19 

 BODY:
Home builders, aided by low mortgage rates and mild weather, broke ground in January on the largest number of projects in nearly two years, the Commerce Department reported today, raising hopes that the housing market would help revive the economy.
 Construction of new homes and apartments rose last month to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.68 million units, a 6.3 percent increase over December's level. 
 The increase, which was larger than expected, pushed housing construction to its highest level since February 2000 and came after a 2.3 percent decline in December.
Analysts noted that low mortgage rates had helped the housing market thrive despite recession.
Another factor attracting new-home buyers is the appreciation in housing values, particularly as stock prices decline, economists said. Mild weather also played a role. "It looks as if housing will help the economy escape the recession," said Joel L. Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisers.
Construction of single-family homes rose 3.5 percent in January, to an annual pace of 1.35 million, on top of a 4.4 percent increase in December. The building of apartments, condominiums and other multiple-unit housing rose to a pace of 287,000 units in January, an 8.3 percent increase from the previous month. In December, multifamily-housing construction plunged 20.4 percent.
By region, housing construction rose 8.7 percent in the Northeast in January, to a pace of 162,000. In the South, it increased more steeply, up 14.4 percent to an annual 800,000. But in the West, housing construction fell 3.6 percent, to a pace of 377,000, and in the Midwest, it dipped 0.3 percent, to a 339,000 unit pace.

HEADLINE: Ruling Favors Auto Insurers, Citing Fraud In Claims 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH P. FRIED 

 BODY:
A New York State judge yesterday upheld stricter no-fault auto insurance regulations that the Pataki administration had been trying to put into effect for two years in an effort to curb soaring auto insurance fraud in the state. 
 The new administrative regulations decrease to 30 days from 90 the period an injured party has to report an accident to the responsible insurer, and to 45 days from 180 the time for doctors to submit compensation claims for treating the injuries. 
 A spokeswoman for the State Insurance Department said the agency would put the regulations into effect immediately, meaning that the stricter rules would apply to all newly written policies and to existing policies upon their renewal. 
But the chief lawyer for a coalition of medical, legal and consumer groups that had brought the lawsuit in State Supreme Court in Manhattan to try to block the tighter regulations said it was highly likely that the coalition would appeal the decision and also seek to keep the regulations from going into effect pending the outcome of an appeal.
In refusing to declare the adoption of the new rules "arbitrary and capricious," as the coalition of groups argued, Justice William A. Wetzel held that their adoption was "well within the authority" of the state. He said the regulations were justified in the effort to remedy a no-fault system "diseased by fraud of a dimension which threatens the economic viability of the program and carries enormous financial consequences for insurers and insureds throughout the state."
The Pataki administration adopted the changes because it agreed with the insurance industry's view that the tighter deadlines would allow insurance companies to spot fraudulent claims more swiftly and reduce opportunities for unneeded diagnostic tests and treatments.
Insurers say that the rise in no-fault fraud has led to major cost increases for them, and Gov. George E. Pataki is said to be concerned that moves by the companies to raise premiums to cover such costs could become an issue in his re-election campaign this year. Last month, Allstate, the largest auto insurer in the state, said it would raise its rates an average of 10.5 percent in the state.
The opponents of the tighter deadlines say they penalize honest medical providers and victims, like an injured passenger or a pedestrian who may not be able to learn quickly which insurance company is responsible for making payments, or a victim whose injuries are slow in manifesting themselves.
Justice Wetzel cited Insurance Department statistics showing that "reports of no-fault fraud have skyrocketed from 489 reported cases in 1992 to 12,372 cases" in 2000. A spokeswoman for the department, Terri Marchon, said most of the reports came from insurance companies' investigative units, while others came from members of the public.
Although fraud by individuals and doctors exaggerating injuries continues, more and more fraud schemes involve organized rings staging auto accidents. They often involve several people in the cars playing the roles of drivers and passengers who are "treated" by doctors, chiropractors, radiologists and others who are part of the rings, which sometimes include lawyers who sue the insurance companies if they balk at paying claims.
The tighter deadlines had been overturned in June 2000 by another State Supreme Court justice in Manhattan, Phyllis Gangel-Jacob, who ruled that the Insurance Department had not complied with required procedures in adopting the new regulations by, among other things, failing to consider their impact on accident victims and their doctors. But Justice Wetzel said the state "went back to the drawing board" and properly took the "added burdens" into account.

PERSON: Liz Krueger 

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES; 
Heading Off to Albany, Looking for Bigger Game

BYLINE:  By JOYCE WADLER 

 BODY:
LIZ KRUEGER, the state senator-elect from Manhattan's East Side, has one of those "Yeah, right" styles of irony, and if you want to see for yourself, step into the kitchen of her Upper East Side house.
 It's one of New York City's hidden houses, an 1865 farmhouse behind a brownstone, with little rooms, family furniture. In the living room, a bright plastic tablecloth covers a cloth of antique lace. (The plastic tablecloth puzzle: sign of a down-to-earth person who does not care about image, or a politician so image savvy that she knows what an excellent image that would be?) Taped to the refrigerator door is a calendar. 
 Booked any time for vacation, Ms. Krueger?
"People keep asking me that," says Ms. Krueger, 44, a Democrat and onetime associate director of the Community Food Resource Center who last week defeated Assemblyman John Ravitz and won a seat that had been held by a Republican for more than three decades. "I say, I'm getting sworn in in a week, I have an office to set up, I have a majority leader threatening to take me out at the knees. Who within the first three seconds of my getting elected is saying, 'She ain't seen nothin' yet. We won't let any of her legislation get to the floor.' " 
Segue into the political speech:
"My response was that's exactly the problem. No important legislation that matters for the city moves forward; no progressive agenda for the state of New York is ever allowed to move to the floor." 
The majority leader in question is, of course, Joseph L. Bruno, a Republican, whose party still controls the Senate.
Even so, her victory in the special election called to determine the successor to former Senator Roy M. Goodman, who resigned to join Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's administration, has been noted. Ms. Krueger, who had made an earlier bid for the seat in 2000, beat Mr. Ravitz by 18 percentage points. And while Democrats outnumber Republicans in the 26th Senate District, Ms. Krueger has still been credited with running a fierce campaign.
It has also been an expensive campaign. It has been estimated that the Republicans may have spent $2 million, and the Democrats $1 million, with Ms. Krueger's parents generously giving their support. 
Ms. Krueger, whose father, Harvey M. Krueger, is a vice chairman of Lehman Brothers, says she has a thick skin, but the image of her as rich kid disturbs her.
She did not grow up on Park Avenue, Ms. Krueger says, she grew up in Ridgewood, N.J., and attended public schools. She now has a trust fund and it enabled her to give up her $55,000-a-year job and enter politics, but it would not be enough to support both herself and her husband, Dr. John E. Seley, a CUNY professor.
"We knew we were going to have to raise money to be competitive," Ms. Krueger says wearily. "Having spent 20 years directing money on anti-poverty issues and improving the delivery of government services to middle- or low-income people, I'm not particularly concerned about my reputation."
Asked last week how much her parents had contributed to her campaign, she said it was "conceivably $200,000." Figures from the State Board of Elections later showed that her parents had given a total of $328,000 -- $102,000 to Friends of Liz Krueger, $226,000 to the New York State Democratic Senate Campaign Committee. 
Asked about the discrepancy yesterday, Ms. Krueger said she had not been aware of the size of their contribution at the time.
She doesn't speak to her parents about these things?
"Sure, but I had a four-week campaign."
AS for elected office, it was never Ms. Krueger's first interest. She knew in high school she wanted a career in "public policy social welfare issues," in part because of a high school exchange program that took her to a farming community in Nebraska and a coal mining town in Pennsylvania. But after receiving a master's degree in public policy from the University of Chicago in 1981, she ended up at the Cleveland Food Bank.
"It was just when Ronald Reagan had gotten into office and was defunding every major federal social welfare program," Ms. Krueger says. "At the same time, there was a major recession in the Midwest. I was asked to look into what the federal government had in surplus food. In eight weeks, I was the expert."
Her memories of that time: women standing in line for five-pound blocks of processed cheese even as the food stamp program was cut back, reinforcing to her the "absurdity" of the government's program.
In the mid-80's, she came to New York and worked for the Community Food Resource Center, which was also involved in health care, housing and job placement. Approached about a run for City Council 10 years ago, she declined. When State Senators Thomas K. Duane, Eric T. Schneiderman and Daniel Hevesi asked her to run for the Senate seat in 2000, she was still uncertain. 
She went to Albany with a list of 29 reasons why she should not run. Then she came home and commissioned a poll that showed she had a 20 percent chance of winning. Then she ran anyway. 
She muses. "You know that Anne Tyler book, 'The Accidental Tourist'? I often think I'm the accidental politician. Though when I've thought about what I could accomplish, it doesn't seem accidental at all."

HEADLINE: Commercial Real Estate; 
Room for Investment in Brooklyn

BYLINE:  By SANA SIWOLOP 

 BODY:
While scouting around for office properties in downtown Brooklyn in the summer of 1999, Frances and Glenn Schor, who head the TreeLine Companies, quickly settled on a century-old six-story building at 180 Livingston Street. Built in 1900, the 270,000-square-foot building first served as a general warehouse for the Abraham & Straus department stores, but its sole occupant at the time was an office of the New York State Workers' Compensation Board. 
 There were rumors that the board would soon be vacating half the building. According to the Schors, the building was the only one in downtown Brooklyn at the time -- indeed, in several years -- that had at least 100,000 square feet of available space, the minimum amount that they calculated they needed to make their investment pay off. 
 The Schors, whose company is based in Carle Place on Long Island, have long liked to invest in what they consider undervalued buildings throughout the New York area.
Still, it was not until November last year, two and a half years after they decided to pursue the building, that they were finally able to acquire control of 180 Livingston through a 20-year ground-lease agreement; they had to wait for another deal to fall through.
The Schors declined to say how much they paid for the ground lease.
Last spring the workers' compensation office moved out of 180 Livingston, and the building is now in a $6 million renovation that local officials hope will help promote development in a section of downtown Brooklyn that has lagged nearby areas. 
The area is commonly known as the Livingston Corridor, a mile stretch of Livingston Street from Boerum Place to Flatbush Avenue that also includes Schermerhorn Street, one block south. Dominated mostly by large, foreboding and often rundown government buildings, as well as parking lots, it is an area developers have long bypassed.
Efforts are under way to increase the corridor's appeal, especially at night. One effort is aimed at rezoning four blocks of the street to permit the construction of both larger office and residential buildings. Meanwhile, the Brooklyn Tabernacle, an 8,000-member congregation now based on Flatbush Avenue, is renovating the 1918 Loew's Metropolitan theater across from 180 Livingston. It is to serve as the base for a planned three-building complex with roughly 140,000 square feet of space.
In March, the Empire State Development Corporation, a state agency, also hopes to accept a proposal to develop two large parking lots on Schermerhorn Street, one for commercial and retail use, the other for town houses.
To James Whelan, who leads the Downtown Brooklyn Council, part of the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce, the residential development on Schermerhorn and the commercial development at 180 Livingston mean "there are now going to be two strong anchors for both types of development in the area." 
The first tenant at 180 Livingston Street is scheduled to arrive in mid-March, at a building that will have amenities rare in the area, like a 1,800-square-foot lobby and high-speed telecommunications service.
The Schors say they have leased roughly half the property to five tenants that include a 250-seat family-style restaurant on the ground floor; the Brooklyn Tabernacle, which needs the space for more offices; Legal Services for New York City; and TheraCare, a Manhattan company that provides developmental and educational services to young children. Space is still available on the third and fourth floors at an asking price of $23.50 a square foot a year.
As for the fifth and sixth floors, where the asking price is $27.50 a square foot, the Schors say that a large public agency has expressed strong interest in both floors. 
According to Robert Hebron of Ingram & Hebron Realty, the building's leasing agent, office space in downtown Brooklyn is now $27 to $30 a square foot. He said that while space is now available on Fulton Street at $17 to $20 a square foot, it is above ground-level retailers and also lacks amenities like lobbies. 
Joan Bartolomeo, president of the private nonprofit Brooklyn Economic Development Corporation, a tenant at a TreeLine property in Brooklyn Heights, has contracted with the Schors to market space at 180 Livingston to local nonprofit groups. She says nonprofits could benefit from being near one another and that 180 Livingston offers an attractive building at a reasonable price. She said that nonprofits can now generally afford rents in downtown Brooklyn in the range of $18 to $20 a square foot. 
Some brokers think that other types of tenants may also be able to negotiate relatively good deals at 180 Livingston. Adelle Klein, a senior managing director at Sholom & Zuckerbrot in Long Island City, Queens, said that the building might be particularly attractive if space were priced in the low $20-a-square-foot range. 
Mr. Schor did not disagree. "We're market driven," he said. "We're very aggressive at making a deal."

Internet Concerns Drop Plans To Merge on F.T.C.'s Opposition

BYLINE:  By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
Faced with government opposition, the two largest companies that measure the audience for Internet sites ended their proposed merger.
 Last October, NetRatings Inc., based in Milpitas, Calif., agreed to pay $71.2 million for the much larger but financially crippled Jupiter Media Metrix Inc., a New York company that combines Internet audience measurement with research and trend spotting. 
 The companies said yesterday that the staff of the Federal Trade Commission had told them that it would oppose the merger because the combined company would control a huge majority of the market for Internet ratings. The companies argued that the F.T.C. should instead see them as two small players in the broad business of providing market research. 
They were considering fighting the government in court, but the F.T.C. also blocked an agreement for Net Ratings to lend money to Jupiter before the merger closed. Since Jupiter is rapidly running out of cash, the companies decided they could not afford to wait and fight the F.T.C.
The government objected to the loan because the collateral was Jupiter's assets and intellectual property, the companies said. That meant that if Jupiter defaulted, NetRatings would be able effectively to take control of the company, and in that case the F.T.C. would be powerless to block it. A spokesman for the F.T.C. declined to comment.
Now the fate of Jupiter is very much in doubt. At the end of last year, Jupiter had $16 million in cash, down from $98 million a year earlier. It expects to have only $6 million at the end of March.
"The irony here is that Washington, D.C., has the most benign regulatory environment we have seen in a generation, and this is the one deal they take issue with," said John Corcoran, an analyst for CIBC Oppenheimer. "Jupiter was very, very wobbly as a stand-alone company." 
Jupiter said it had hired Robertson Stephens to find a new source of financing. Robert Becker, the chief executive, said Jupiter would probably be split with various divisions sold to separate buyers.
"Anything we do won't be as good for our shareholders or customers as the NetRatings transaction," Mr. Becker said, "but somehow we will find homes for all these talented people and valuable brands."
Investors did not seem to hold out much hope yesterday that any potential deal would provide much for shareholders. Shares of Jupiter lost three-quarters of their value, falling to 19 cents, down 62 cents. Shares of NetRating fell 4 cents, to $14.11.
Jupiter's business is hardly attractive. In the fourth quarter its revenue fell 63 percent, to $14.5 million. Only 35 percent of its contracts were renewed.
NetRatings is in relatively better shape, although it, too, has been hit by the decline of Internet advertising. In the fourth quarter, its revenue fell 22 percent, to $5.1 million. It has more than $300 million in cash. Its renewal rate was 56 percent. It is controlled by the Dutch conglomerate VNU, through its ACNielsen unit, which also runs the popular television ratings operation.
NetRatings nonetheless said yesterday that it would lay off 20 people, 15 percent of its work force, and eliminate two research products.

HEADLINE: Times Somber, Ads Follow in Tone and Topic 

BYLINE:  By STUART ELLIOTT 

 BODY:
The collapse of the Enron Corporation is hastening a sea change in the way American business talks to consumers in its advertising.
 The change has been under way as a result of the dot-com bust, the terrorist attacks and the economic slowdown. All those dislocations have led Madison Avenue to discontinue campaigns that celebrated how young business upstarts took risks, broke rules and thought "outside the box." For instance, Enron itself -- which in a campaign in 2000 demanded "Ask why" -- urged people to "question things" and asserted it was "changing the way industries think." 
 The successor campaigns are more serious and measured, focusing on topics that had been considered boring, like continuity, experience and customer service. The actors portraying business owners and executives may now wear suits and ties, and sometimes even have gray hair.
Signs of the new old-fashionedness are coming every few minutes in the NBC coverage of the Winter Olympics. "Times have changed," declare commercials for E*Trade Financial by Goodby, Silverstein & Partners in San Francisco, an agency owned by the Omnicom Group, which mock how online trading and venture capitalists helped feed the Internet stock frenzy.
Spots for United Parcel Service by the Martin Agency in Richmond, Va., owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies, describe new U.P.S. services with a humble customer focus rather than an omniscient corporate focus -- as evident in the theme, "What can Brown do for you?"
And commercials for NBC's parent company, General Electric, salute moments from the past, including film of Thomas A. Edison, to embrace rather than eschew tradition. The goal of the spots, by the New York office of another Omnicom agency, BBDO Worldwide, is a very un-Enron-like demonstration that "for over 100 years, G.E. has been a company powered by ideas," as an announcer asserts.
"We wanted the ads to give a sense of the depth and scope of the company," said Beth Comstock, vice president for corporate communications at General Electric in Fairfield, Conn., "juxtaposing the old and new to show where we've been and where we're going."
In other words, when it comes to electricity, Enron, no; Edison, yes.
Until recently, "it was Adobe saying 'Defy the rules' and Qwest saying 'Change everything' and Merrill Lynch saying 'Be bullish' and Apple saying 'Think different,' " remarked Warren Berger, the author of "Advertising Today" and the editor of One, a magazine published by the One Club for Art and Copy in New York.
"Now, there's Enron hangover," he said. "Anything revolutionary, urging people to grab the brass ring, is seen as negative."
Mr. Berger is to be the moderator of a panel discussion tonight on creativity in the post-Enron environment at the One Club in Manhattan.
"When I watch TV, there's more of a cautionary tone, seeking to reassure," said one of Mr. Berger's panelists, Patrick O'Neill, the co-executive creative director at the New York office of TWBA/Chiat/Day.
"I don't feel that 'can-do' spirit any more, because the can-do American capitalist system went too far with Enron," Mr. O'Neill said. "After all the money people lost, it's not believable when a company promises you can do everything." 
"Companies said to the world, 'We make money a whole different way and it's too complicated for you to understand,' " said Chuck Porter, chairman of Crispin, Porter & Bogusky in Miami. "The collapse of Enron signaled the end of that wild and woolly, gunslinger mentality."
The change is being accompanied by starkly different visual imagery for the ads, which "is going to be a little less wacky and a little more normal," he added. "People will look more like George W. Bush and less like Jerry Garcia.
"Being 'out of the box' means being edgy, and edgy is out," said Cheryl Berman, chairwoman and chief creative officer at Leo Burnett USA in Chicago.
"People are more skeptical of hotshot know-it-alls," she said. "They want track records, proof of what you can really do, what you can really deliver."
If "out of the box" or "outside the box" are still evoked, it is as parody, like a campaign for Grape-Nuts cereal, sold by Kraft Foods, that carries a headline inviting consumers "to think out of the bowl," with the word "box" crossed out.
The Taco Bell division of Tricon Global Restaurants has a campaign carrying the theme "think outside the bun," which spoofs the jargon of dot-com and high-technology marketing. The Grape-Nuts ads are produced by Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide in New York, part of the WPP Group, and the Taco Bell ads are from the San Francisco office of Foote, Cone & Belding, owned by Interpublic.
Even more pronounced changes may be ahead. "Our society may not look to business and business idioms to define who we are," said Donny Deutsch, chairman and chief executive at another Interpublic agency, Deutsch in New York, "if people feel business isn't working for them."
"Instead of saying you're a dot-commer or a corporate chairman, the answer may be 'I'm a great squash player' or 'I'm active on my school board,' " he said. "Or we may return to idealizing individual professions like doctors, teachers and firefighters, who are the new rock stars."

HEADLINE: Released Killer Withdraws Plan To Move In With Father in S.I. 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: NEWARK, Feb. 19 

 BODY:
Thomas Trantino, who spent 38 years incarcerated for killing two police officers, has abandoned plans to move to his father's Staten Island apartment because the building's landlord threatened eviction, Mr. Trantino's laywer and family members said.
 Only days ago, Mr. Trantino, 64, thought he would be sharing a one-bedroom apartment with his 89-year-old father in Greenridge, Staten Island, and working as a drug counselor in Camden. But he now finds himself homeless and unemployed. 
 His brother, Richard Trantino, said the threat of their father's eviction prompted Thomas Trantino to withdraw the apartment as his proposed address on an application he had submitted, through the New Jersey State Parole Board, to the New York State Division of Parole. Tom Grant, a spokesman for the division, said the request had been withdrawn, not rejected. 
In light of the landlord's reaction, Mr. Trantino has abandoned the idea of living with family members, his brother said, and is living in a homeless shelter in Camden. He left a halfway house on Feb. 12. 
Richard Trantino said his brother was looking for a home and a job in the Camden area, and that the family and his lawyer were exploring whether his rights had been violated. 
"Thomas got so upset over what happened over this, he doesn't even want to set foot on Staten Island," said Mr. Trantino, adding that he had tried to reason with his father's landlord. "I went down there, and he just started yelling and screaming, 'I don't want a killer in my house!' "
The landlord, Richard Dean, did not return calls seeking comment. 
Mr. Trantino had been scheduled to begin work today as an assistant substance abuse counselor at a Volunteers of America center in Camden, said his lawyer, Roger A. Lowenstein. But the organization failed to seek the necessary waiver to employ a parolee, and told Mr. Trantino he would not be hired. 
Mr. Lowenstein said the loss of his client's job and apartment prospects were a result of a conspiracy by police groups, the state parole board and others. Kim Esposito, a spokeswoman for the Volunteers of America's Delaware Valley chapter, denied the assertion, and said the failure to seek a waiver was an oversight, not the result of outside pressure. 
Kenneth Connolly, executive director of the New Jersey parole board, denied there was any conspiracy, and said the state was trying to help Mr. Trantino find work and a home. 
Sadie Tedesco, the mother of one of the slain officers, said in an interview that she had no sympathy for Mr. Trantino. "He's an animal; who would take him in?" she asked.

HEADLINE: 2001 Bankruptcy Filings Set a Record 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 19 

 BODY:
With the economy mired in recession, debt-burdened United States consumers and businesses filed for bankruptcy in record numbers last year, the Administrative Office of the United States Courts said today.
 The total number of bankruptcies filed during the year jumped 19 percent, to 1.49 million from 1.25 million, in 2000. 
 That total easily surpassed the previous high of 1.44 million bankruptcies, which was recorded in 1998.
Economists have predicted for some time that bankruptcies would reach new highs in 2001 as the recession took a toll on the finances of consumers and corporations alike.
Some experts expect the surge to continue this year.
Congress has also been trying to tighten the nation's bankruptcy laws, so some debtors may have filed pre-emptively.
But that effort is now stalled, largely because lawmakers do not want to be seen as piling on the pain at a time when consumers are feeling an economic pinch.
Personal bankruptcy filings totaled 1.45 million in 2001, up 19 percent from 1.22 million in 2000.
Business bankruptcies rose slightly less sharply, increasing 13 percent, to 40,099 from 35,472 in the previous year.

HEADLINE: Bored Saudi Youth Take Wild Side to the Street 

BYLINE:  By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: RIYADH, Saudi Arabia 

 BODY:
A rebellion of the bored is being waged on the streets and highways of Saudi Arabia. 
 Late one night in mid-December on the coastal road in Jidda, about 1,000 young men went wild. According to the Arabic-language Saudi daily Al Watan, they whooped and hollered, harassed women in passing cars, blocked traffic, attacked police officers and smashed car windows. The police, untrained in riot control, called in reinforcements who dispersed the crowd, but not before a number of people were injured. 
 Shortly afterward in the city of Dammam, more than a dozen young men surrounded a limousine, beat the driver and dragged his three female passengers from the car, Al Watan reported. 
Then in early February in the city of Khobar, after the Saudi soccer team beat Qatar to win the regional Gulf Cup, a group of young men took to the corniche to celebrate. After they threw stones and bottles at the police, more than 100 were arrested and two security officers were injured, again according to Al Watan.
By all accounts, the youthful exuberance was touched off not by politics but by ennui. Saudi Arabia is, after all, a theocratic kingdom that bans dating, cinemas, concert halls, discotheques, clubs, theaters and political organizations and offers few oases like museums, libraries or gyms.
Young people are expected to conform to the dictates of both tradition and religion, despite their exposure to the diverse world they discover from satellite television, mobile phones, the Internet, and in the ubiquitous expressions of American culture in their shopping malls -- from Starbucks to Planet Hollywood. 
"They have put us in a box," said a 17-year-old high school graduate too scared of his family to allow his name to be used. "And you know what happens when you are put in a box. You throw it open and go wild." 
The rambunctiousness also reflects larger economic, social and demographic problems: a shrinking job market, the high cost of marriage, an educational system grounded in rote memorization and an erosion of family values in a country in which 65 percent of the population is under the age of 25. 
Because of lower oil prices, per capita income has slid from $28,600 a year in current dollars in 1981 to below $8,000 today. Crown Prince Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz is so concerned about the kingdom's economy that he warned in a message to government agencies two weeks ago that the kingdom is suffering a "suffocating crisis" and ordered a crackdown on government spending.
The pressures have left many young people confused and restless, and admiring of the radical defiance of the Saudi-born Osama bin Laden. However, there appears to be little appetite for the terrorism and violence advocated by bin Laden. Rather, young men are rebelling in other ways: by luring police officers into 120 mile-an-hour chases on the freeways, tossing firecrackers into crowds at soccer matches, even disguising themselves as women to infiltrate women-only spaces. On the night of the incident in Dammam, two young men were killed during a high-speed joy ride when their Toyota Camry hit a lamppost.
Rebellion often takes the form of Tom-and-Jerry chases with the police. On a main intersection of the capital city, Riyadh, after the soccer game against Qatar, for example, two men stopped traffic, turned up the volume of their rock music, jumped out of their car and started dancing wildly. Before the police could catch them, they jumped back in and sped away. Some groups of young men cruise girls' schools as they are closing -- all the better to harass girls on their way home. 
Religion and tradition prohibit unmarried men and women from mixing easily, but some of them -- sometimes with the complicity of their parents -- find ways around the rules. At a recent private party in a mansion in Jidda, a port city that historically has been much freer than Riyadh, about 50 young men and women in various states of dress and undress talked, sipped soft drinks, danced, even groped each other. At midnight, a lavish dinner was served by a gaggle of servants. The parents of the hostess kept watch from the vast living room. 
"I'd rather have my kids having fun at home where I can watch them than be nervous that they are roaming the streets," said the young woman's mother. "As long as we keep these things private, no one will bother us."
In another part of Jidda, privileged young women have their chauffeurs drive them to a chic restaurant where they flout convention by dining on their own and imitating young men at nearby tables by smoking water pipes filled with fruit-favored tobacco. 
More ominous than such antics is the willingness of young people to confront the police, a new phenomenon in a society that puts a premium on obeying authority. 
"It's the police, not the Saudi youth, that are dangerous," said a foreign diplomat who has investigated the incidents. "The police in the cities aren't trained at all in crowd control. What happens if the police cannot put down the demonstrations? Do they start shooting?"
In the incident in Dammam, the diplomat said, the police blocked roads and walkways, nearly causing a stampede as bystanders struggled to flee. 
Coincidentally, Saudi newspapers like Al Watan and the English-language Arab News have begun to play a more activist role by reporting and analyzing such incidents. 
"As a young Saudi myself, I wondered, what has got into our young people?" wrote Raid Qusti, a 27-year-old Saudi journalist, in a recent commentary in Arab News. "Can this be the behavior of Muslim young people who have studied Islamic textbooks from elementary through secondary school?"
Mr. Qusti offered his own explanations for the behavior. The first, he said, is bad upbringing. "Life has changed and the economic situation is tighter than before, so the father is too bogged down making a living and earning money," he wrote. "As for the mother, if she's not working as well, she's too busy on the phone or at a friend's or going out to a mall."
Then there is "repression" of the country's youth. "Any youth has hormones," Mr. Qusti wrote. "Too much leisure time and having nothing to do can get them flowing at breakneck speed."
Finally, he noted the absence of the rule of law, and favoritism for the powerful that have contributed to an erosion of the moral fabric of society.
"It's obvious the young men had no respect for the law," Mr. Qusti said of the youths in Jidda and Dammam. "Perhaps some of that is due to their parents who failed to teach their children respect for authority. But we must say that when the law is applied to everyone -- including ministers, heads of departments and V.I.P.'s -- then perhaps we Saudis will respect the law. 
"Would a police officer dare to give a ticket to any of the above for running a red light? Impossible!"

HEADLINE: Indictment in Dartmouth Case Outlines Robbery-Killing Plan 

BYLINE:  By PAM BELLUCK 

DATELINE: BOSTON, Feb. 19 

 BODY:
Two teenagers accused of killing two Dartmouth professors last year had tried in vain over several months to talk their way into other people's homes, where they intended to kill them after stealing their A.T.M. cards and passwords, according to an indictment unsealed today. 
 The teenagers tried four other houses in Vermont and New Hampshire in a six-month period before they got inside the home of the professors, Half and Susanne Zantop, by pretending they were conducting an environmental survey, the indictment says. 
 The indictment released by Grafton County Superior Court in Haverhill, N.H., is the first suggestion of a motive for the stabbing deaths, which stunned the community of Hanover, N.H., where the Zantops lived. 
One teenager, James J. Parker, 17, pleaded guilty in December to a reduced charge of being an accomplice to second-degree murder in the death of Susanne Zantop. He has agreed to testify against the other teenager, Robert W. Tulloch, 18. Mr. Parker's lawyer, Cathy Green, declined to discuss the case or to say whether he had provided the details for the indictment. Mr. Parker faces a sentence of 25 years to life in prison. 
Mr. Tulloch has indicated that he will use an insanity defense in his trial, which begins in April. He is charged with first-degree murder, and the indictment added another charge, conspiracy to commit murder. Mr. Tulloch's lawyer could not be reached for comment today. 
Both teenagers were high school students in Chelsea, Vt., and the indictment says that their first efforts to talk their way into a home occurred in two small communities near their town. 
According to the indictment, the teenagers first conceived of the plan to rob and kill people in June 2000. A month later, on July 19, they cut the telephone wires to a house on Green Goose Road in Vershire, Vt. Then, Mr. Parker hid while Mr. Tulloch knocked on the door and said that his car had broken down and that he needed to make a phone call. Their plot failed because the person who answered the door refused to let them in, the indictment said. 
The teenagers made a second robbery-murder attempt about six months later, the indictment says. First, they bought two military-style knives over the Internet. Then, on Jan. 19, 2001, they knocked on the door of a house on North Hollow Road in Rochester, Vt., saying they were conducting an environmental study for school. That resident also refused to let them in. 
The same day and eight days later, the teenagers tried two other houses on Trescott Road in Hanover, N.H., about 45 miles away, but in each case nobody answered the door. Then, on Jan. 27, Mr. Zantop, a professor of economic geology, answered the knock at his home at 115 Trescott Road and invited Mr. Parker and Mr. Tulloch in to conduct their survey. The indictment says that Mr. Tulloch asked Mr. Zantop a series of questions, while Mr. Parker pretended to take notes. 
Later that day, Mr. Zantop, 62, and Ms. Zantop, 55, the head of German studies at Dartmouth, were found stabbed to death in their study. The indictment says the teenagers left the house with Mr. Zantop's wallet, but it is not clear whether they obtained the A.T.M. card or the PIN number. They drove away, stopping the car to wash blood off the knives and a floor mat from the car, the indictment says. 
Then they returned to the Zantop house to retrieve the knife sheaths but turned away after seeing a police car in the driveway. Mr. Parker's fingerprints were found on one knife sheath, investigators have said. 
Later, the indictment says, the teenagers burned Mr. Zantop's wallet and Mr. Tulloch's clothes. The teenagers were arrested in February 2001 at an Indiana truck stop. 
Prosecutors did not return calls seeking comment today. In the past, they have said that a bloody boot print matching Mr. Tulloch's left boot was found in the Zantops' home and that Ms. Zantop's DNA was found on one knife. Investigators have also said two knives stained with the Zantops' blood were found under the bed in Mr. Tulloch's bedroom.

HEADLINE: In Control Group, Most Welfare Recipients Left the Rolls Even Without Reform 

BYLINE:  By NINA BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
They may be the last people in America to have experienced welfare as we used to know it -- 2,400 Connecticut families randomly assigned in 1996 to get public aid under old welfare rules, as a control group for one of the nation's most ambitious welfare reform experiments. 
 But during four years of economic boom, without any of the work requirements, time limits or extra subsidies used to push or lure their counterparts off public aid, 81 percent left welfare for jobs. And at the end of the research -- just before the economy began to sour -- 72 percent were still off the rolls. 
 Those results are among the more startling findings in an unusually rigorous welfare study released this week as Congress begins debating the reauthorization of the 1996 federal welfare overhaul law. 
The Connecticut study did find that recipients assigned to the state's "Jobs First" welfare reform program were more likely to leave welfare for work than those in the control group. But the differences between the groups were modest: 5 percent more Jobs First participants took jobs at some point, and 9 percent fewer were on the rolls after four years. The cost of those differences was $4,100 per person more in subsidies and services in Jobs First.
The Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation, a nonpartisan research organization, conducted the evaluation of the Jobs First program under a contract with the state.
State officials said the study results confirmed that Connecticut's welfare reform program had succeeded in replacing a culture of welfare with a culture of employment. But Dan Bloom, an author of the study, disagreed.
"It shows that a lot of what we've been talking about in the last few years would have happened without welfare reform," he said.
In the end, the similarities between the two groups were striking: both sets of families remained poor, with low wages and high levels of hardship, like lacking money to buy food. One small but statistically significant difference was particularly troubling: 2.6 percent of Jobs First participants became homeless in the study's third year -- a percentage point more than in the control group. 
The Connecticut study, which followed 4,800 parents on welfare -- mostly single mothers -- in New Haven and Manchester, is one of the first detailed evaluations of a state program with the three key features of the national welfare overhaul: stricter work requirements, financial incentives and time limits. 
Patricia A. Wilson-Coker, commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Social Services, said the study only reinforced her belief in the state's welfare-to-work efforts. It shows that the message spilled into the control group, she said. "There was a real culture change that took place. Unless you were going to put somebody in a test tube, it would be difficult to insulate them."
The Connecticut study echoes similar findings from earlier control groups around the country. A recent national comparison of 11 welfare reform experiments held between 1991 and 1999, in places as diverse as Atlanta, Detroit, Portland, Ore., and Riverside, Calif., found that over a five-year follow-up period, in the absence of any welfare-to-work programs, about three-quarters of welfare recipients in the control groups found jobs at some point, and in the end more than half had left the rolls. 
Few of the programs improved substantially on those rates, the federal study found. Some saved the government money on welfare, and many modestly added to the number of months when some people held jobs, increasing overall earnings. But none made its enrollees better off financially in the long run, and several left the poorest participants significantly worse off, according to the national study, released by the United States Department of Health and Human Services in November. 
That study, which focused on comparing welfare reform approaches, drew little attention to the high rates of work in the control groups. Most states disbanded such control groups by 1997, when the national welfare overhaul went into effect. Connecticut's was one of the last.
Mr. Bloom said the Connecticut findings underscore concerns about how poor families will fare in a recession if they have exhausted their federal welfare benefits and lose their jobs. "Our study largely ends where the recession starts," he said. 
The Connecticut program set one of the nation's shortest time limits on benefits -- 21 months -- and one of the most generous financial incentives to take a job. Recipients who went to work were generally allowed to keep their full welfare allotment in addition to their earnings. The state hoped to increase the chance that they would find steady work. It seemed to pay off, as 60,000 families left the rolls. 
But the study indicates that much of the shrinkage would have taken place anyway. Moreover, because the new rules encouraged Jobs First participants to keep collecting welfare in addition to their earnings, many exhausted their benefits quickly. During the economic boom, welfare extensions were available to those making a good-faith effort to comply with the rules. But last year, the state toughened the rules to save money.
Even before the changes, the study indicates, housing was a greater problem for Jobs First participants. By the third year, 35.5 percent of the Jobs First participants were unable to pay the full rent or mortgage they owed, 4.2 percent more than in the control group. Nearly 10 percent -- 3.5 percent more than in the control group -- had moved in with friends or family. And among the 4,800 study participants, the statistics on homelessness translated into 62 homeless families in Jobs First, compared with 36 homeless families among the control group. 
Shelley Geballe, an official with Connecticut Voices for Children, a New Haven organization that works with welfare recipients, noted that the state's unemployment rate, now 3.2 percent, was as low as 1.7 percent during the study. Homeless shelters are now reporting record numbers of applicants.
"This is the best-case scenario," Ms. Geballe said. "From this point on, it gets more challenging."

HEADLINE: Case Could Shift Balance In Debate on Public Domain 

BYLINE:  By AMY HARMON 

 BODY:
In the annals of the digital copyright wars, major media companies facing the threat of Internet piracy have so far triumphed decisively over their challengers, who argue that the public's interest is being sacrificed to provide copyright holders with greater control.
 But legal experts said the Supreme Court's decision yesterday to hear a case challenging the constitutionality of a 1998 law that extended the term of copyrights by 20 years may serve to realign the balance in favor of those who want more works in the public domain. 
 Even if the court ultimately upholds the law, the case is likely to focus public attention on a debate that has broad implications for the way creative work is produced and consumed, but that has so far been largely limited to lawyers and business executives.
"Merely the fact that the court will hear and decide on this case is of huge importance," said James Boyle, an intellectual-property professor at the Duke University School of Law. "It will crystallize the concerns over the state of the public domain." 
At first glance, the case, Eldred v. Ashcroft, appears to have little to do with the perils and promises of distributing copyrighted works over the Internet. At issue is whether Congress overstepped its authority to grant copyrights "for limited times" to "promote the progress of science and useful arts."
In 1790, the maximum copyright term was 28 years. Now it can last more than 100 years.
But Lawrence Lessig, a Stanford Law School professor who represents the plaintiffs, said the issue had greater significance today because of the Internet. The medium would make possible a broad range of creative expression, he said, if people did not have to track down and pay for the rights to material that could be freely available to the public. 
"Before the Internet, a creator's ability to put new works out there all depended on commercial publications, because only they could afford the cost," Mr. Lessig said. "But at this stage, it becomes important to establish the principle that the public domain is here and meant to be perpetually fed by works passing into it after a limited copyright protection."
It is hard to gauge the economic impact that overturning the law would have on copyright holders. The Walt Disney Company is often singled out as an example of a business that profited from public domain -- drawing on works like Victor Hugo's "Hunchback of Notre Dame" and Hans Christian Andersen's "Little Mermaid" to make movies that enriched both the modern culture and its shareholders -- and now profits from closing it off.
But a spokesman for Disney said that it supported the law primarily because it brought the United States into conformity with European copyright law. "The things we used from the public domain are centuries old," said John Dryer, a spokesman for Disney. "If this law is upheld, which we fully expect it will be, it doesn't place a burden on anyone."
In any case, Disney is pressing its case on other copyright fronts at the moment. 
The term-extension battle is being waged amid a larger fight that pits copyright holders against the spread of technology that allows almost anyone to easily copy and distribute almost any work online.
Disney's chairman, Michael D. Eisner, is expected to testify before the Senate Commerce Committee next week in favor of a draft bill that would mandate that anti-copying technology be built into computers and consumer electronics to safeguard digital television broadcasts. 
Disney is also one of several other major media firms that has filed copyright-infringement suits against several successors to Napster, the Internet music-swapping service that has been hobbled by court order. 
The major movie studios are also seeking an injunction against SonicBlue, the maker of the Replay digital video recorder, because its most recent model allows consumers to send TV programs they have recorded over the Internet.
And the studios are continuing to prosecute a case against a magazine that published a computer program that could be used to circumvent the copy controls on DVD's.
A federal appeals court panel found the magazine violated the terms of another 1998 copyright law, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, by publishing and linking to the program.
The magazine, 2600, has appealed the case to the full Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.
It is in the broader context of these copyright battles that some legal experts and public advocates are greeting the Supreme Court's decision to hear the Eldred case as a potential shift in the judiciary's treatment of copyrights.
"If those who defend the public interest in copyright can win this battle," said Siva Vaidhyanathan, an assistant professor of information studies at the University of Wisconsin, "that means the Supreme Court will have once again clearly defined that copyright is supposed to work for the public and not a small set of corporations."

HEADLINE: AES Says It Will Sell Assets And Cut Capital Spending 

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
The AES Corporation, the electricity producer whose stock has been battered as investors worry about how it intends to finance itself in a sour economy, said yesterday that it hoped to raise as much as $1.5 billion by selling assets and would cut capital spending by 38 percent this year.
 The restructuring announcement, which came after a round of meetings over the long holiday weekend, did not reassure Wall Street. Shares of AES, which by the close of trading on Friday had fallen 88 percent from a 52-week high of $60.15, fell an additional $2.25 yesterday, to $4.75. 
 AES, which is based in Arlington, Va., decided to take action after developments last week, which included a reduction in the ratings on its outstanding unsecured debt to less than investment grade and fears that a decline in the value of the Venezuelan bolivar would worsen the company's problems in Latin America, where it has extensive interests. 
In the fourth quarter, profit at AES fell 80 percent on losses from its Latin American operations and the devaluation of the Argentine peso. AES produces electricity in 32 countries. 
"Our world has changed," Dennis Bakke, the company's president and chief executive, said at the beginning of a conference call with securities analysts yesterday. 
The changes "have led us to assume that we will not have access to the capital markets anytime soon," he said. "Our clear priority is on liquidity, particularly in this coming year." 
To shore up its balance sheet, AES said it had reduced planned capital spending by $490 million in 2002, to $790 million from $1.28 billion, primarily through the elimination or postponement of spending on projects already in construction. 
In addition, AES said several assets would be sold, including Cilcorp, a utility in Illinois; a minority stake in Ipalco, a utility in Indiana; and the company's interest in Itabo, a coal-powered operation in the Dominican Republic.
These sales, and the sale of other AES plants that executives would not identify, are expected to raise $1 billion to $1.5 billion. 
Barry Sharp, the company's chief financial officer, said that excluding asset sales, the company expected to have $374 million in cash and credit at the end of the year. The company now has about $265 million in cash and credit, he said. 
The company also said it intended to reduce its exposure in Latin America through the sale of all or part of its interests in "certain businesses." 
And AES plans to withdraw from spot market trading of electricity in markets like New York, California and Britain, which have been subject to wide and risky price swings. 
"All of those divestiture proceeds will be used to pay down debt," said Roger W. Sant, the chairman of AES. "From then on we will conduct our business with a much more conservative balance sheet." 
Analysts said the steps were necessary, given concerns in the market about the company's liquidity. But some wondered just how much cash AES would be able to raise in what is now a buyer's market. 
The slumping economy and the collapse of the Enron Corporation have combined to punish many energy companies. To shore up credit ratings and balance sheets, many of these companies have also put a variety of assets up for sale. 
"We believe it will be difficult for AES to command a fair value for any assets it puts up for sale in the near term," Ronald Barone, an analyst at UBS Warburg, wrote in a note to clients. "The markets in which AES operates are depressed and there are a number of other companies that are already looking to dispose of similar assets to shore up their balance sheets. In addition, the urgency with which AES will likely approach these sales will put them at a significant disadvantage at the negotiating table." 
The sharp decline in the price of AES stock took a personal toll on Mr. Bakke, who helped found AES 20 years ago, and two other senior executives. 
As a result of the stock's slide last Friday, Mr. Bakke was forced to sell up to seven million shares to satisfy a margin call on a $36 million loan. At the beginning of December, Mr. Bakke owned about 32 million shares, or about 5.8 percent of outstanding AES common stock. 
Mr. Sharp, the company's chief financial officer, and Mark Fitzpatrick, an executive vice president, sold a total of less than 400,000 shares because of margin calls Friday.

HEADLINE: At Spy Stores, Era of 9/11, Not 007; 
Customers Now Want Gas Masks Instead of Camera Pens

BYLINE:  By JACOB H. FRIES 

 BODY:
It did not take Arielle Jamil, a new sales clerk, too long to pick out the paying customers at the Counter Spy Shop: men who wanted a 007 after their names.
 These men gravitated to gizmos. They nearly drooled at the sight of night-vision goggles. They wanted the pens that doubled as cameras. They bought the telephones that detected lies. 
 And so it went at the store for 10 years. Until September. 
"It's shifted from the kitschy James Bond, money, excess, fast cars market to the more serious side of personal protection," said Ms. Jamil, the onetime sales clerk at her father's company and now its spokeswoman. "After Sept. 11, all of a sudden the silly toys weren't so important. People were more worried about what life's going to be like in the new age of antiterrorism and how they were going to protect their families."
The shop, on Madison Avenue between 49th and 50th Streets, sold more than 2,000 gas masks and 1,500 hazardous-materials suits in September alone, Ms. Jamil said. Sales of letter-bomb detectors and bulletproof vests also jumped, she said.
But since then, Counter Spy Shop's owners have been amazed to find that sales of their expensive products have remained strong. The wobbly economy may have slowed the frenetic pace of shoppers half a step, but every government warning of a possible terrorist strike keeps people on edge and coming through the doors, Ms. Jamil said.
This public anxiety has enabled the store to defy sagging retail trends, nearly doubling its normal sales of personal security equipment, to $4 million from $2.25 million, over the past five months compared with the same period a year ago, Ms. Jamil said.
In fact, sales at stores around the city that sell antiterrorism devices have remained strong over the past five months.
They are so strong that, despite the sputtering economy and the sorry state of Wall Street, the Counter Spy Shop's parent company, CCS International, plans to go public next month. Aside from running the retail shops around the world, CCS, with headquarters in New Rochelle, N.Y., manufactures special product lines for law enforcement agencies and governments and maintains a training division. 
Why does CCS think this is an especially good time to offer stock? Its chief executive, Ben Y. Jamil, believes that since Sept. 11, consumers have been willing to shoulder the high cost of personal security.
"The rose-colored glasses are being taken off," Mr. Jamil said. "There's public acceptance that the good days are gone and that there are serious people out there who hate us. The technology that we have developed is giving us a serious advantage."
Some financial experts have their doubts. Arnold Ursaner, an industry analyst at CJS Securities in White Plains, said he was a little skeptical because much of the security market was already cornered by the largest companies. "Wall Street is always looking for the next fad du jour, but I don't know if this niche market has broadened all that much," Mr. Ursaner said. "The hardware is not where the money is."
But it is easy to see why spy shops may be looking at stock offerings. Sales, primarily of gas masks, also surged at Army surplus shops and survival stores immediately after the attacks and continue to ride a swell, store managers said last week. 
Jim Korn, a manager at Kaufman's Army and Navy on 42nd Street west of Times Square, said some people have been so unnerved that they will buy anything, even junk, if it gives them peace of mind. The whole thing got out of hand, Mr. Korn said, so the owners decided to pack away the remaining gas masks and sell them only to collectors or to theaters as props.
"We'd tell them, 'Do you realize there's not any warranty? The warning label in red says there's no guarantee it will protect you,' " Mr. Korn said last week. "But people just didn't want to know. They all say, 'It's better than nothing.' " 
Quark Spy Centre, on Third Avenue near East 36th Street, has begun to market a $65,000 device to detect plastic explosives, figuring it could become the next big thing, said Gregg Graison, vice president of Quark International. "We all got a quick education right after the attack," Mr. Graison said. "Now we're trying to look into the crystal ball." 
The new demands have even begun to draw veterans of the Israeli military, intelligence and security forces to the United States looking for their cut of the pie. Yesterday, at a conference in Midtown Manhattan, the Israeli government introduced about 40 of the country's security and technology companies to potential American customers.
Roy Bordes, council vice president of the American Society for Industrial Security, a trade group, said the security market had moved beyond knee-jerk fear to a more long-term fear. "In the beginning, everyone was just confused," he said. "But in the last two months, more average Americans are calling, asking, 'How can I really make my life safe?' " 
While the security industry finds it hard to predict growth, and no one dares to estimate the impact of another attack, one thing is certain: the products are not getting cheaper. 
At the Counter Spy Shop, hazardous materials suits to be worn in the event of a nuclear, biological or chemical threat are priced at $299. Gas masks range from $299 to $499. The large bulletproof leather jacket is $1,800.
While costly protection is selling strong, many of Counter Spy Shop's die-hard customers -- the 007 fans and the gadget lovers -- have begun to return, said Dan Gallo, a sales representative.
Last week, Eric Richman, 29, an entertainment lawyer, was in the store browsing. "I'm always looking for interesting gadgets, usually for gifts for men," he said. "My dad just loves cutting-edge toys."
Out on the street, the store's window display -- a mannequin dressed for the apocalypse -- caused pedestrian rubbernecking along Madison Avenue. Those who stepped inside were caught off guard by an old Cabbage Patch doll modeling an Israeli-made safety suit for infants.
The price tag: $499.

HEADLINE: APPELLATE COURT EASES LIMITATIONS FOR MEDIA GIANTS 

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 19 

 BODY:
A federal appeals court handed a huge victory to the nation's largest television networks and cable operators today, ruling that the government had to reconsider sharp limits on the number of stations a network can own and striking down the regulation that had restricted cable operators from owning television stations.
 Unless overturned on appeal the ruling would remove significant impediments that have prevented companies like AOL Time Warner, a big cable operator, from merging with broadcast networks that own TV stations. It would also permit big broadcast networks like Viacom's CBS and the News Corporation's Fox, which have bumped against the station-ownership limits, to continue buying stations, unimpeded. Page C1. 
 The decision, which was seen as a setback by smaller owners of broadcast stations and consumer groups advocating more diversity in media ownership, could open the door for a new wave of megamergers in the entertainment and media industries and a continued concentration of power among the biggest media companies. 
Executives at big media companies said the ruling was a welcome recognition that the ownership rules had become outdated in an era of media consolidation.
"We're very pleased the court vacated the cable broadcast cross-ownership regulation," said Paul T. Cappuccio, general counsel of AOL Time Warner, which had challenged the regulation in court. "The rule had long ago become an anachronism and did not serve the public interest. It wasn't remotely necessary to protect competition."
But consumer groups expressed alarm at the prospect of further concentration of ownership.
"Comcast and Time Warner will be kicking the tires on NBC before the week is out," said Andrew Jay Schwartzman, president of the Media Access Project, a group that advocates diversity of the airwaves. He said his group would appeal the decision, taking it to the Supreme Court, if necessary. "It's a terrible thing for diversity of viewpoint in general, for programming diversity in particular, and it will increase the price of video programming to the American public if upheld."
The media ownership rules were supported by Democratic regulators appointed during the Clinton administration. But today's court decision continues a series of actions the last year by the courts and by the Federal Communications Commission under the Bush administration to eliminate decades-old ownership restrictions and other regulations that have constrained the expansion of the largest companies in the television, cable and telephone markets.
One regulation addressed in today's decision -- a limit on the number of television stations that can be owned by the networks -- was sent back to the F.C.C. for reconsideration. Under its current chairman the agency is all but certain to either significantly water down or abandon altogether the rule, which has prohibited a network from owning stations that reach a potential audience of more than 35 percent of households with televisions in the United States. 
The court went even further with the other rule, the one preventing companies from owning a cable system and broadcast station in a single market, by simply striking it down. 
The ruling came in the consolidation of five separate cases, in which the the F.C.C. had sought to defend the ownership regulations. But Michael E. Powell, the chairman of the agency, has long been openly skeptical of those rules. During the Clinton administration, he was one of the two Republican commissioners at the agency who dissented from the F.C.C. decisions in 2000 to leave in place the two regulations that were at issue in today's decision. 
More recently, Mr. Powell has questioned the need for the regulations at a time he says consumers have a broad array of choices in news and entertainment. He has repeatedly said the agency needs to provide better evidence to justify the ownership limitations, and he has questioned the need for media concentration rules beyond the traditional restraints found in antitrust law.
Officials at the agency and at the National Association of Broadcasters, which represented the network affiliate stations that lost today, said that they were studying the decision and had not decided whether to seek an appeal. 
In a unanimous opinion, three judges from the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ordered the F.C.C. to reconsider a TV ownership regulation that had its antecedents in the 1940's and was rooted in the fears of the European experience at the time that the television industry in the United States could come to be dominated by a few powerful interests. 
The regulation, the National Television Station Ownership Rule, was intended to "prevent any undue concentration of economic power" and promote diversity of the airwaves by promoting the power of the local affiliate stations that broadcast programming from the networks but are not owned by them. The affiliates have raised concerns the last year that a relaxation of the ownership rules would tilt the balance of power toward the networks -- the companies with which the stations must negotiate programming rights and the sharing of advertising revenue. (The New York Times Company owns eight stations in smaller cities around the country -- four CBS affiliates, two ABC and two NBC.)
The rule had begun to crimp the expansion efforts of the largest networks, before the appeals court put a temporary stay on the rule last year, pending the outcome of today's case. Viacom's acquisition of CBS last year put that company's market share at 41 percent. The rule has also presented complications for Fox in completing its purchase of Chris-Craft Industries, which would give the company a reach of more than 40 percent of the national audience.
The television rule was challenged by Fox Television Stations, NBC and Viacom.
The second regulation struck down today, the cable broadcast cross-ownership rule, prohibits a cable operator from owning a broadcast station in the same market. In challenging the rule, AOL Time Warner did not identify a particular transaction it had in mind, but noted that the regulation prevented it from acquiring television stations in markets, like New York City, where it owns a cable system.
Whatever the long-term benefits the media giants might gain from yesterday's ruling, the prospect that some companies might go on buying sprees apparently prompted investors to sell their shares. In a generally off day for the stock market, for example, AOL Time Warner shares were down 53 cents, to $25.52. Shares of Walt Disney, which owns the ABC network, were off $1.04, to $22.86. Viacom's stock was off $1.17, to $42.38. 
And yet, share prices have been rising lately for smaller companies that own TV stations and might become acquisition targets. The stock of one such company, E. W. Scripps, rose 77 cents yesterday, to $74.02, just below the record high the stock reached only last week.
The opinion in Fox Television Stations v. Federal Communications Commission, No. 00-1222, was written by Chief Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg and joined by Judges Harry T. Edwards and David B. Sentelle. They concluded that the F.C.C. had been "arbitrary and capricious" in the way it had written the regulations and had presented insufficient evidence to justify their utility. 
The panel rejected arguments by the networks and AOL Time Warner that the regulations violated their First Amendment rights. But the judges found that the agency had violated the Administrative Procedure Act, which requires that a federal agency provide a reasonable basis for its decisions. 
"In sum, we agree with the networks that the commission has adduced not a single valid reason to believe the national television station ownership rule is necessary in the public interest, either to safeguard competition or to enhance diversity," the court said. "Although we agree with the commission that protecting diversity is a permissible policy, the commission did not provide an adequate basis for believing the rule would in fact further that cause."
On the cable rule, the court said that the commission had responded "feebly" to challenges by Time Warner and that the agency had "failed to justify its retention " of the rule "as necessary to safeguard competition."

HEADLINE: Snowmobilers Gain Against Plan for Park Ban 

BYLINE:  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 19 

 BODY:
The Bush administration took another formal step today toward overturning the Clinton-proposed ban on snowmobiles in Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks and along the 82-mile parkway that links them.
 At the behest of the snowmobile industry, the Interior Department issued a supplemental environmental impact statement, and it offered three alternatives to the phaseout, proposed by President Bill Clinton, that was to begin next December and take full effect in the winter of 2003-4. 
 The three alternatives are these:
*To delay the phaseout for a year, allowing afterward only the mass-transit snow coaches permitted under the Clinton plan. 
*To continue to allow snowmobiles on all existing snow roads but reduce the numbers allowed in at the popular West Entrance to Yellowstone while increasing numbers allowed through other entrances. This alternative would also require new emissions- and noise-reducing technology on all snowmobiles entering the parks.
*To allow snowmobiles on only the major snow roads rather than all of them, reduce numbers in some areas and require the new technology.
The department will now solicit opinions on the alternatives through May 29 and is to decide by late fall whether to choose one of them or to stand by the original proposal.
This is the fifth time the department has solicited public comment on the question of snowmobiles in the national parks. Most of that comment has consistently favored a ban, largely because of engine emissions and noise. Pollution at the West Entrance to Yellowstone has become so intense that the National Park Service has had to pump fresh air into the booths staffed by park rangers there, and last week provided respirators for them as well.
The Clinton administration issued its snowmobile phaseout rules on Nov. 22, 2000, and the final regulations were published by the Interior Department on Jan. 22, 2001, two days after Mr. Clinton left office.
But the International Snowmobile Manufacturers Association argued that snowmobile makers had not been sufficiently heard, that snowmobilers had a right of access to the parks and that nearby businesses would be hurt by the ban. Moreover, the manufacturers said, the new pollution-reducing technology should be taken into account.
They negotiated a procedural settlement with the Bush administration that became final on June 29, 2001. Under the settlement, the Park Service agreed to prepare the supplemental environmental impact statement that it issued today.
The document said the second alternative -- keeping snowmobiles but limiting their number through the West Entrance of Yellowstone and increasing their numbers through other entrances -- would produce about three-fourths the level of current air pollution. It said the third alternative -- allowing snowmobiles on only the major snow roads -- would produce about one-third the current emissions.
As for noise, it said the second alternative would produce twice as much as the third. It said that the second alternative would also be worse for wildlife, and that all the alternatives would reduce jobs and the local economy by less than 1 percent.
Alix Rauschman, spokeswoman for one environmental group, the Natural Trails and Waters Coalition, responded by saying, "The Bush administration clearly is using this as a stalling technique toward eventually overturning the ban."
Ed Klim, president of the snowmobile makers' group, was not available for comment, although he had said in the past that he expected the impact statement issued today to counter "inaccuracies and misinformation used to smear snowmobiles."

HEADLINE: Pataki's Santo Domingo Tour Passes Into Tropic of Politics 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic, Feb. 19 

 BODY:
Children, adults and scruffy dogs crowded pastel cinder block storefronts, hanging on wrought iron security gates, waving and cheering at the pack of dignitaries who strolled today through Cristo Rey, one of the poorest barrios in this city.
 Alma Santos, a 22-year-old hairdresser, did not recognize the lanky American who was the center of attention, towering over the rest of the group. When told it was George E. Pataki, governor of New York, she said, "Who is that?" When Mr. Pataki's role in his homeland was explained, she smiled broadly and said, "I'm glad he's here." 
 Mr. Pataki this week became the first sitting governor of New York to visit this nation that is the source of a growing voting bloc back home, making a 22-hour tour of the capital city, before proceeding this afternoon to Puerto Rico. He repeatedly showed off his much-improved Spanish, visited the president, offered comfort to the families of people killed on American Airlines Flight 587 and delivered medical supplies. At each stop, the reactions of Dominicans, who were often nonplussed or a bit cynical about Mr. Pataki's motives, were enthusiasm and gratitude that he would focus his attention on them. 
Most of the Dominicans who saw him today may have had little idea who he was or why he was here, but not so their former compatriots in New York, where his visit was heavily covered by the Spanish-language media, and the English-language, as well, a fact that was noted approvingly by his aides.
By afternoon, it seemed that this year's race for governor of New York was being conducted more here than there, as Andrew M. Cuomo, one of the Democrats seeking to unseat Mr. Pataki, arrived in the Dominican Republic, holding his own meeting with President Hipolito Mejia, before visiting a housing project. Peter Ragone, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, the former United States housing secretary, said the trip had been planned for "well over a month," though the reporters Mr. Cuomo so ardently courts did not learn of it until today.
Mr. Cuomo emphasized that this was not his first time in the country, noting that he had visited as part of the federal government's relief efforts after Hurricane Georges wiped out whole towns here in 1998. "I'm very happy to be back in Santo Domingo and to have the chance to meet with President Mejia," he said in a statement.
While Mr. Pataki, a Republican, insisted that "this trip isn't about politics," he is running for a third term, and he has aggressively pursued Hispanic support in New York for the last year and a half. Last year, Mr. Pataki became an outspoken critic of the bombing tests on the island of Vieques. He visited the island -- his arrival today marked his second trip to Puerto Rico in 10 months -- and he has worked hard to build personal ties to Hispanic political, labor and business leaders. His hand-picked state party chairman, Alexander F. Treadwell, has said that Republicans' future rests on recruiting Hispanic voters.
His aides said yesterday that the State of New York, and not Mr. Pataki's campaign, would pay for this trip, but they would not provide an estimate of its cost. In addition, his wife, Libby, planned to join him on Thursday for a few personal days of vacation, which the governor planned to pay for personally, his aides added. 
The third major gubernatorial candidate, Comptroller H. Carl McCall, spent much of the day at a national meeting of a government employees' union in Washington. Mr. McCall's campaign strategist, Hank Sheinkopf, said, "Pataki's interest in the Hispanic community has to do with the fact that Democrats outnumber Republicans in New York by a 3-to-2 margin, and he's trying to cover that, and with respect to Andy, Andy has no record and Andy likes photo ops, and Andy's trying to build a base."
(For his part, Mr. Cuomo planned to travel to Haiti next, and had issued a statement saying he would meet with President Jean Bertrand Aristide. And he had his family in tow.)
The politicians who accompanied the governor here -- mostly Hispanic Democrats -- found the jockeying vastly amusing, and said it could only benefit their communities. "After Sept. 11 and Flight 587, there is a need to pull people together, and Governor Pataki is doing that," said Assemblyman Jose Rivera of the Bronx, who supports Mr. McCall. "If, unfortunately, that makes him more popular in our communities, and we Democrats have some catching up to do, then so be it."
At each stop today, the governor, who arrived in Santo Domingo Monday evening, used a few words of good Spanish, drawing howls of approval when he declared, at a Roman Catholic Church in Cristo Rey, "Cristo Rey es mi barrio" -- "Cristo Rey is my neighborhood." He has clearly been practicing.
"He listens to Spanish language radio, he has some tapes he listens to, he speaks in Spanish with some members of his staff," said Michael McKeon, the governor's communications director.
Time and again, Dominicans said it came as a pleasant surprise that a governor of New York would focus his attention on them. In particular, they said, they would not have expected him to devote much of his day to touring Cristo Rey, an area not found in the guidebooks, where the governor stopped at a church, a soup kitchen and a medical clinic, the jacket of his navy wool suit only briefly removed in deference to the tropical sun, his tie tightly knotted throughout.
"The Dominican politicians don't come here," said the Rev. Rogelio Cruz, the priest who acted as the governor's guide through Cristo Rey. "When there are elections they might come, but after they win, we don't see them for four years. Governor Pataki is here."
There are elections in New York this year, a fact that was not lost on the more worldly people who greeted Mr. Pataki, Father Cruz included. "I'm surprised to see him here, but I think the Hispanics are getting more attention in New York and there is an election coming up," said Dr. Pedro Silverio, director of the economic research center at a university here where the governor had breakfast with local business and religious leaders. "But whatever the reason, the important thing is he is recognizing how important the relationship is with the Dominican Republic."
 The trip grew from tragedy, when Mr. Pataki showed the World Trade Center site to President Mejia, who extended an invitation then to visit his country. Two months later came the crash of Flight 587 on the Rockaway Peninsula, bound from John F. Kennedy Airport to Santo Domingo, killing 265 people, many of them Dominican-Americans with family in both countries.
The governor described the meeting with relatives of those died as the main reason for making the trip. But time and again, their questions dealt with matters over which Mr. Pataki has no control, like visas and settlements with American Airlines. He promised to have a pamphlet drafted, explaining to the families their legal rights, to work toward memorials to the victims here and in New York, and to promote better coordination among agencies responding to the tragedy.
After the meeting, Patricia Encarnacion and Alba Baez sat to one side, wiping tears from their cheeks as Mr. Pataki took questions from reporters. Jovanny Baez, husband of Ms. Encarnacion and son of Mrs. Baez, died in the crash, and they learned today that, as they had suspected, there was little Mr. Pataki could do about their resulting legal problems.
"He didn't seem to have the answers, but it's good he came," Mrs. Baez said. "It's good someone is listening."
It was a sentiment heard throughout the day.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: HEARTS AND MINDS; 
Bush Will Keep the Wartime Operation Promoting America

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER and JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 19 

 BODY:
President Bush has decided to transform the administration's temporary wartime communications effort into a permanent office of global diplomacy to spread a positive image of the United States around the world and combat anti-Americanism, senior administration officials said today.
 "The president believes it is a critical part of national security to communicate U.S. foreign policy to a global audience in times of peace as well as war," said Dan Bartlett, the White House communications director. 
 While discussions are at a preliminary stage, officials said there was general agreement in the administration that the intense shaping of information and coordination of messages that occurred during the fighting in Afghanistan should become a permanent feature of national security policy.
The White House office to be created to carry out the policy will coordinate the public statements of State, Defense and the other departments like the Voice of America to ensure that foreign correspondents in Washington as well as foreign leaders and opinion-makers overseas understand Mr. Bush's policies. 
"What is important is we want to do a better job of using the government seamlessly to give direction to the president's global diplomacy," a senior administration official said.
Officials said the new office would be entirely separate from a proposed Office of Strategic Influence at the Pentagon, which would use the media, the Internet and a range of covert operations to try to influence public opinion and government policy abroad, including in friendly nations.
That office is contemplating plans, which are being reviewed by Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld, to disseminate information, and possibly even disinformation, in foreign media as part of an aggressive campaign by the military to promote American policies overseas.
Today, the president of the Radio-Television News Directors Association, Barbara Cochran, wrote a letter to Mr. Rumsfeld objecting to any plans involving the spread of false or misleading information by the Pentagon.
Like the office of Homeland Security, the efforts to centralize public diplomacy following the Sept. 11 attacks have grown in importance and urgency in the last six months.
So far, the new White House office has no name, no director and no budget, though officials say Mr. Bush has said money will be no obstacle in pursuing the effort. The earlier White House push to create a more positive image of the United States after Sept. 11 was led by Karen P. Hughes, senior adviser to the president and is known as the Coalition Information Center.
The major goal, officials said, is to stem what the White House sees as a rising tide of anti-Americanism.
"A lot of the world does not like America, and it's going to take years to change their hearts and minds," said a senior official involved in the discussions. 
The president broached the possibility of a permanent mission in a meeting with the top people who speak for the administration in September. "He told us that we were going to be at this for a long, long time," one participant said, "that we were setting a template for future presidents, that we had to think big, strategic, historic thoughts." 
Global diplomacy as envisioned in the new office will inject patriotism into the punishing 24-hour, seven-day news cycle, officials said. It will include information campaigns about Mr. Bush's domestic policy -- like education bills -- as well as traditional information about the military, diplomatic and economic sides of national security policy, officials said.
Rather than create agencies, the new office would take advantage of the huge communications network of American embassies, their media offices and the broadcast network already in place under the State Department. 
Charlotte Beers, a former advertising executive now in charge of public diplomacy at the State Department, has used her marketing skills in an attempt to make American policies as familiar as American culture. 
Officials involved in the global communications effort said it required clear direction from the White House to break down the bureaucratic walls built up around the government after the cold war ended and the focus on defeating a clear-cut enemy disappeared.
Foreign journalists say they have given up getting meaningful interviews from American officials here. Only the most senior ambassadors from allied countries meet regularly with government policy makers. 
"There was often the feeling that we were either taken for granted or considered irrelevant," said Patrice de Beer, the former Washington correspondent for Le Monde, the French daily. "We don't expect anyone to deliver state secrets to us but to be accessible to explain what the policy was. That's all." 
In the earlier White House effort, Ms. Hughes joined forces with her British counterpart to put together the Coalition Information Center, known as the war room. 
When Washington decided to highlight the Taliban's policy against women's rights, officials enlisted not only First Lady Laura Bush but Cherie Blair, the wife of the British prime minister.
"The Afghanistan women's campaign was the best thing we've done -- giving insight into their vision of the future," said Jim Wilkinson, the head of the Coalition Information Center.

HEADLINE: Honeywell Hires TRW Chairman as Chief 

BYLINE:  By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
Honeywell International, after a search of several months, said yesterday that it had hired David M. Cote, 49, chairman of the TRW Corporation, as its chief executive, effective immediately. Lawrence A. Bossidy, 66, Honeywell's current chief, will remain chairman until June 30. Then Mr. Cote, who signed a five-year contract, will get that title, too. 
 Analysts say that Mr. Cote was not Honeywell's first choice. As recently as December, analysts were pegging Karl J. Krapek, who retired as president of United Technologies in January, as a front-runner. 
 Still, most analysts seemed pleased with Mr. Cote's appointment. "Dave Cote is demanding, he's disciplined, and he's a great decision maker," said Howard A. Rubel of Goldman, Sachs & Company. 
In a conference call, Mr. Cote and Mr. Bossidy reaffirmed plans to keep Honeywell -- whose attempt to merge with General Electric last year failed -- independent.
"I'm not interested in merging or selling off parts," Mr. Cote said. "I want to grow the bottom line by growing the top line."
He faces an uphill battle. The Sept. 11 attacks, combined with the plummeting economy, wreaked havoc with the market for cockpit controls, plane parts and other aerospace-related items, which provide about 40 percent of Honeywell's sales. And the sluggish economy has hurt Honeywell's chemicals businesses.
Moreover, although Honeywell recently sold its brakes business, it still faces possible litigation from its use of asbestos in break pads.
"Asbestos problems can always come back to haunt them," warned Nicholas P. Heymann, an analyst with Prudential Securities.
Mr. Cote told TRW that he was leaving late last week. TRW named Philip A. Odeen, who was retiring as executive vice president for Washington operations, as its nonexecutive chairman, and pulled Timothy Hannemann and John Plant, the respective heads of TRW's aerospace and automotive businesses, into a makeshift office of the chief executive. Mr. Odeen expects it to take at least four months to find a new chief.
"We were surprised that Dave left, but we have a good team in place," Mr. Odeen said. 
Now, finally, Mr. Bossidy makes the same claim for Honeywell. Mr. Bossidy retired as Honeywell's chief executive when his former company, Allied Signal, merged with Honeywell Inc. in 1999 to form Honeywell International. Then last year, Michael R. Bonsignore, Mr. Bossidy's successor, resigned in the wake of the failed merger with G.E., and Mr. Bossidy came back from retirement. 
He has since slashed jobs and sold ancillary businesses, and analysts increasingly recommend the shares. Yesterday, though, investors were not listening: Honeywell's shares dropped 99 cents, to $32.65.
In many ways, Mr. Cote's background is well suited to Honeywell. Like Mr. Bossidy, he spent more than 20 years working for G.E., rising through several management posts in G.E.'s aircraft engines, silicones and appliances divisions. He earned a degree in business administration from the University of New Hampshire while supporting himself as an hourly worker in a G.E. plant in Hooksett, N.H. William J. Conaty, senior vice president for corporate human resources at G.E., said Mr. Cote became a finance and management whiz on the job. 
By the time Mr. Cote left G.E. for TRW in 1999, he was president of the $6 billion GE Appliances division. More important, he was well steeped in Six Sigma, the quality-control program that both G.E. and Honeywell have used to cut costs and shore up productivity. 
Those who know both Mr. Bossidy and Mr. Cote are struck by their similar styles. "They're hard-driving, results-oriented people who have no hidden agendas," said Mr. Conaty, a close friend of Mr. Cote. 
Although his tenure at TRW was brief -- Mr. Cote was just named chairman in July -- his impact was considerable as he sold off numerous businesses, cut jobs and consolidated TRW's three automotive divisions into one unit. He also replaced 8 of the top 14 executives at TRW. 
Although few analysts recommend TRW stock, many gave Mr. Cote an A for effort. "They were impressed with how dramatically he reduced overhead and revitalized management," said Charles L. Hill, director of research at Thomson Financial/ First Call.
Mr. Cote's departure shook up TRW shareholders. Though the appointment was not announced until after the market had closed, word leaked out earlier. Shareholders sent TRW shares down $3.29, to $41.75.

HEADLINE: Bush Plays Ball With Japanese Premier 

BYLINE:  By HOWARD W. FRENCH and JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 19 

 BODY:
In one appearance after another during President Bush's 72-hour stay in Japan, his praise for Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi was so hearty that many Japanese were left with the impression of one long bearhug.
 During a joint news conference on Monday, Mr. Bush spoke over and over again of his confidence, faith and trust in Mr. Koizumi and his efforts at economic reform. Mr. Bush resumed that tone today before Parliament, comparing the prime minister to Ichiro Suzuki of the Seattle Mariners, the 2001 American League most valuable player. 
 The president called Mr. Koizumi "a close friend," who "reminds me of a new American star, Ichiro -- the prime minister can hit anything you throw at him."
Mr. Bush's unusually enthusiastic embrace comes, awkwardly, at a time when Japanese themselves have been fast losing confidence in a leader who had been extraordinarily popular. So from economic experts to stock traders to Japanese political analysts, the question many people were asking today was whether the American pep talk would do Mr. Koizumi any good.
The initial response from the markets was not encouraging. The Nikkei 225 index of the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell back below the psychological 10,000 barrier, and the dollar enjoyed its biggest gain in a week, jumping about one yen to hover around 133 yen.
While answering reporters' questions during the news conference, Mr. Koizumi spoke with remarkable candor at one point about Japan's string of economic reversals since the late 1980's. "Ten years ago Japan was perhaps a little overconfident," he said. "Today, Japan has lost confidence in itself."
Many Japanese political analysts say that lately it is Mr. Koizumi himself who has lost self-confidence as well as the confidence of the public. The prime minister has been battered in opinion polls recently over his firing of a popular foreign minister and is increasingly facing challenges from within his own Liberal Democratic Party.
Indeed, before his vaunted economic reforms ever got off the ground, Mr. Koizumi has been under pressure to change direction and declare a new war against deflation.
"The most important impact of the visit will be on Koizumi himself, because Koizumi lost his confidence," said Ikuo Kabashima, a political analyst at Tokyo University. "The gesture of friendship from President Bush will give him more legitimacy within his own party. The impact on the people, though, is less certain, and in the end it may be pretty slim."
But because Mr. Bush did not offer advice to Mr. Koizumi publicly, nor did the prime minister make his persistent but vague pledges to carry out economic reforms any clearer, few analysts were willing to predict a new departure for the Japanese economy or for Mr. Koizumi's standing with the public.
"Bush felt it was wise to show strong support for Koizumi rather than making critical, or even constructively critical comments," said Takashi Inoguchi, a specialist in international relations at Tokyo University. "It was amazingly amicable, but without much substance. The result is that we were left with a lot of ambiguities on both sides."
On North Korea, for example, Mr. Koizumi expressed understanding for Mr. Bush's comments, including his inclusion of that country in an "axis of evil," but said Japan wanted to normalize relations with North Korea. On global warming, the prime minister contradicted Mr. Bush ever so subtly, saying he saw no conflict between protecting the environment and fostering economic growth.
American ambiguities were just as evident. Andrew Smithers, a British economist here, said after Mr. Bush's plane had taken off for Korea: "I don't think there is likely to be an economic impact at all. The American attitude to Japan is caught in a bind -- they want the Japanese economy to recover, but it can only recover with a weaker yen, which they don't want."
Mr. Smithers contends that Japan can start reducing its public and private debt loads only through controlled inflation. 
Similarly, although Mr. Bush may have avoided criticism of Japan himself, in a recent drumbeat of statements, Bush administration officials have been more direct.
Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, for example, recently spelled out this recovery recipe: "Japan needs to counter deflation, it needs to rely on the market to revalue and revive unproductive assets, and it needs to foster more opportunity through deregulation."
Then Glenn Hubbard, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said in an interview with Japanese reporters, "There's no way Japan can export itself out of its problem without fixing the nonperforming assets and changing the monetary policy."
Japanese and American political analysts agree that beneath the smiles and complimentary talk, Washington is deeply worried about Japan, but also deeply conflicted about what it can do to help this country get its house in order.
The Bush administration has seemed eager to highlight a different approach to Japan from that of the Clinton White House: more friendly support and less lecturing. But in light of this country's steadily worsening economic circumstances, many Japanese say they would welcome more American pressure.

HEADLINE: A News Agency's Rose-Colored Glasses 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 19 

 BODY:
Minutes after President Bush's plane touched down in Seoul today, North Korea's news agency sought to upstage him with an amazing report that two halos had just appeared in the sky above the legendary mountain birthplace of Kim Jong Il.
 "Inhabitants were delighted to see a rare cloud in the shape of Kimjongilia," the state news agency added, referring to an artificially bred flower named after Mr. Kim, North Korea's leader. "Even the sky above the Mount Paektu area seemed to be decorated with beautiful flowers" said the dispatch, written 200 miles away in Pyongyang, the capital. 
 In what the news agency reported as divine coincidence, on Mr. Kim's 60th birthday last Saturday, Mount Paektu marked its 60th day of snow cover, which had accumulated to exactly 60 centimeters.
Churning out of old-fashioned news tickers in Japan or read on the Internet (www.kcna.co.jp), the Korean Central News Agency provides a window on the strange, secretive world of North Korea, a totalitarian government that Mr. Bush lumps together with Iran and Iraq in "the axis of evil."
Through the dispatches of the agency, which is controlled by the ruling Korean Workers Party, an image emerges of an Asian Sparta, a highly militarized, ultra-nationalistic government that seeks to inculcate worship of Mr. Kim. Readers learn that Mr. Bush is "a moral leper," who leads the "empire of the devil." "After flying into South Korea with many war servants and warmongers," the agency said, he is "to examine a plan for a war against the North."
Reflecting the agency's praise of Mr. Kim's "army-centered leadership," North Korea devotes an estimated one quarter of its economic activity to the military, fielding the fourth largest standing army in the world, 1.2 million soldiers.
"The North Korean propaganda machine does not need to be taken too seriously -- it is on auto pilot," Selig S. Harrison, author of a new book, "Korean Endgame" (Princeton University Press, 2002) said from Washington. Noting that the news agency issued a dispatch condemning terrorism after the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States, he added, "When it winds down, that is significant because it means that someone from above has reached out."
Li Yang Su, KCNA's distributor in Japan, said in an interview: "They are, in a word, bashing Bush very hard. They feel Mr. Bush is stifling them, or aiming at the extinction of North Korea." 
But with the latest James Bond movie being filmed with "North Korea" scenes, the agency's approach to news contributes to the reclusive nation's "international villain" stereotype.
North Koreans, whose only access to information is from state sources, will not learn that the United States is the largest food and fuel donor to North Korea.
In the late 1990's, under Mr. Kim's leadership, a famine created by bad weather, a state farming system and a cutoff of Soviet subsidies killed as many as two million people, or almost 10 percent of the population. Today, the United Nations World Food Program, which helps feed 30 percent of North Korea's people, appealed for more money, saying that with pledges for only a quarter of the campaign's $216 million goal, aid would be cut off in early March.
The news agency did not mention that today, reporting that Mr. Kim has pledged to "build a powerful socialist country where national power is strong, everything prospers and people have nothing to desire more in the world."
Mr. Kim's birthday festivities included a garden show. In Pyongyang, the news agency reports, 500,000 people have visited the show. Displaying an enthusiasm that does not seem to extend to growing food, the agency reported that "80 organizations across the country presented more than 14,300 potted Kimjongilias," many coming from the more than 120 Kimilsungia-Kimjongilia greenhouses built across the country in recent years.

HEADLINE: BUSH SAYS THE U.S. PLANS NO ATTACK ON NORTH KOREA 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

DATELINE: PANMUNJOM, South Korea, Wednesday, Feb. 20 

 BODY:
President Bush said today in Seoul that the United States had no intentions of invading or attacking North Korea and that his goal in the Korean peninsula was peace.
 In remarks meant to soothe the fears and anger of South Koreans about what the president has called an "axis of evil" made up of Iraq, Iran and North Korea, Mr. Bush said he fully supported the so-called sunshine policy of negotiations with the North embraced by the South Korean president, Kim Dae Jung. 
 Mr. Bush said dialogue with North Korea was not inconsistent with the tough "axis of evil" talk he first used in the State of the Union address three weeks ago. 
Although the United States has never given any indication that it would attack North Korea, an action that American defense officials have said they considered inconceivable, Mr. Bush's remarks showed the extent to which he has had to reassure American allies at a time when his harsh words are still rebounding around the world.
"Let me explain why I made the comments I did," Mr. Bush said in a joint news conference with Mr. Kim. The president said he spoke out because he believed in freedom and was "troubled by a regime that tolerated starvation.
"I worry about a regime that is closed and not transparent," he added. "I'm deeply concerned about the people of North Korea."
Mr. Bush said several times during the news conference that an offer the United States made for talks with North Korea last June had not been answered and that contact between the two nations was now up to Kim Jong Il, the North Korean leader.
"We're more than willing to speak out publicly and speak out in private with the North Korean leadership," he said. "And again I wonder why they haven't taken up our offer."
Mr. Bush explained his intentions toward North Korea, saying: "We're a peaceful people. We have no intention of invading North Korea. South Korea has no intention of attacking North Korea. Nor does America. We're purely defensive, and the reason we have to be defensive is because there is a threatening position of the DMZ, so we long for peace. It's in our nation's interest that we achieve peace on the peninsula."
Mr. Bush said it was not counterproductive to lash out at a country and its leader and then expect the leader to sit down agreeably for talks. As evidence, he cited President Ronald Reagan's success in dealing with the Soviet Union and said the South Korean president had reminded him of that this morning in Seoul.
"During our discussion, President Kim reminded me a little bit about American history when he said President Reagan referred to Russia as the Evil Empire and then was able to have constructive dialogue with Mr. Gorbachev," he said, referring to Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the former Soviet leader.
Similarly, said Mr. Bush, "I will not change my opinion on Kim Jong Il until he frees his people and accepts genuine proposals from countries like South Korea and the United States for dialogue, until he proves to the world that he has a good heart."
In his remarks, Kim Dea Jung reiterated that there was disagreement between the United States and South Korea over North Korea, although he did not express any opinion about the "axis of evil," which has undermined his position with South Koreans terrified of war with the North. "There was some indication there might be some difference of opinion,' Mr. Kim said. "We were able to reconfirm that there was no difference of opinion between Korea and the United States."
Mr. Kim said he and Mr. Bush had agreed to work together to stop the North from developing weapons of mass destruction and to push for removal of missiles on its border that were within easy striking distance of Seoul, the South's capital.
After meeting with Mr. Kim, Mr. Bush traveled to the edge of the demilitarized zone to deliver a speech there. 
The word "evil" resurfaced again before the speech on a tour of the DMZ, where Mr. Bush reacted in disgust when he learned that axes used to kill two American servicemen were in a museum across the border to the north. "No wonder I think they're evil," he said.
In his formal remarks, he said people on both sides of the border wanted to live without the threat of violence, famine and war. "I see a peninsula that is one day united in commerce and cooperation instead of divided by barbed wire and fear," said Mr. Bush, with Mr. Kim at his side. "Korean grandparents should be free to spend their final years with those they love. Korean children should never starve while a massive army is fed. No nation should be a prison for its own people."
The White House arranged for the speech to be delivered for maximum photographic effect from the Dorasan Station, a sleek new facility near a new rail line and a new road that are to connect the North and South for the first time since the Korean War. South Korea finished its stretch of the road and rail line up to the demilitarized zone this month, just in time for Mr. Bush's visit, but North Korea has yet to start construction. Mr. Bush called on the North to finish the road and the rail line. 
At a meeting in the northern capital, Pyongyang, in June 2000, Mr. Kim and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, agreed to relink the two nations by road and by rail. Kim Dae Jung triumphantly returned from the trip declaring that "a new day is beginning," but he has been frustrated by the North's failure to follow through on this part of the deal.
Today, Mr. Bush's remarks were far more regretful rather than antagonistic, although he did repeat a sentence from his State of the Union address that "We must not permit the world's most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world's most dangerous weapons." 
He literally cast the division between North and South as one between darkness and light. "When satellites take pictures of the Korean peninsula at night the South is awash in light," he said. "The north is almost completely dark."
Mr. Bush said the road connecting the two Koreas was a solution. "Traveling south on that road, the people of the North would see not a threat but a miracle of peaceful development -- Asia's third-largest economy, risen from the ruins of war," he said. 
Mr. Bush is on the second leg of a six-day visit to Japan, South Korea and China, a trip that was to have taken place last fall but was rescheduled after Sept. 11.
He is to travel to Beijing on Thursday. He said in his news conference that he did not know if he would meet with any political dissidents or Christian activists, but that in his last visit with the Chinese leader, Jiang Zemin, he had put his concerns about religious freedoms in China in the context of his own faith.

HEADLINE: Foundation Announces 2 New Grant Programs 

 BODY:
The Howard Gilman Foundation has announced the creation of two grant programs that will award about $9 million over three years to nonprofit performing arts organizations in New York City. The grants, announced Tuesday, will be for artistic and organizational development and technical assistance for dance and for the training of young dance and theater performers. 
 "Howard Gilman loved the arts and especially dance and dancers," Isabella Rossellini, the chairman of the foundation board, said, adding "With our new programs, the foundation will build on Howard's legacy by helping performing arts organizations and talented young artists pursue their dreams." Mr. Gilman, who died in 1998, was the chairman of the Gilman Paper Company and a philanthropist who supported the arts, animal conservation and medical research. 
 The Partners for Performing Arts Program will give three-year grants ranging from $100,000 to $450,000 to dance companies, performing arts presenters and small theaters in New York City that have demonstrated exceptional promise or sustained excellence. The grants are to be used for artistic and organizational development and technical assistance. The foundation will also make available its White Oak Plantation in northeast Florida, where the White Oak Dance Project was formed by Mark Morris and Mikhail Baryshnikov, for artistic residencies. 
The Training and Mentoring Young Talent Program will award one- or two-year grants, ranging from $10,000 to $75,000, to nonprofit organizations offering formal professional and preprofessional training in the arts. 
Arlene Shuler, the foundation's executive director, said that the programs had been in the planning stages for a year and were not a response to economic problems in the arts after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11. "Performing arts groups are essential to New York City's vitality, but sustained support for core artistic and organizational needs is hard to find," Ms. Shuler said. "We're trying to make a difference by addressing this need. We hope that this encourages others to give to dance and the other performing arts."

HEADLINE: Five Rooms, Gucci View 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON 

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif. 

 BODY:
CHRISTINE FRANZ, 35, a software consultant who looks like Meg Ryan, was exactly what developers had in mind when they started Santana Row, a Silicon Valley crest in the latest, most ambitious wave of shopping malls.
 Ms. Franz, demographic perfection, stared out through fashionable sunglasses at the muddy Main Street of the 21-acre site, now concrete and steel. By August, when the $475 million "lifestyle village" is scheduled to open, Santana Row's 17 city blocks will boast 100 specialty shops, including Gucci, Tourneau and Burberry. 
 But shopping is only the start. Santana Row will also be home to the people who live above the stores in 1,200 studios, lofts, town houses and villas. 
Welcome to mall-town America. You can now drop where you shop, a few steps upstairs.
Santana Row is the largest example nearing completion of a new hybrid of retail development and housing that has seized the imagination of the shopping center industry in the last year, just as regional megamall developments have begun to lumber and older suburban strip malls shutter and die.
More than a dozen such malls are breaking ground nationally, in Cincinnati; Littleton, Colo.; Richmond Heights, Mo.; and elsewhere. Developers and municipalities say they have the potential for profit, reinventing dead retail property in older suburbs. Open-air and upscale, with Main Street-style architecture, they are intended to appeal to young professionals with expensive brand-name tastes and retirement-ready empty nesters looking for downtown's retail sophistication.
Commercial developers like to call these shopping villages "communities." The affluent, amenity-laden life as a salable daydream has a familiar history, whether as housing at the edge of the golf course green or condominiums at the tennis club.
Ms. Franz was, to a corduroy-collared, denim-jacketed T, a prime prospect on Santana Row's open-house tour. "Forgive me for sounding snobbish," she said. "But the retail sounds like it's going to be top-notch." A 40,000-square-foot Crate & Barrel will sell the welcome mats.
Fred Smith, 52, an engineer on the tour with Ms. Franz, said: "It's fantastic. I could go downstairs to Starbucks for coffee, then come back upstairs and work on my computer, then go back down to Chili's for dinner."
Mr. Smith is the other side of Santana Row's demographic silver dollar: baby boomers on the brink of retirement, looking for a last place to live -- 20 million of them turning 55 within the next two years.
"And shopping-wise, it's very nice not to have to drive," said Annette Hamon, 55, a graphic artist who owns a house in Cupertino, Calif. "I'd like to live someplace where you don't have so much upkeep yourself."
The builder of Santana Row, Federal Realty Investment Trust, a retail-property developer based in Rockville, Md., with $2.5 billion in assets, compares the mall's mix of shopping and living to a typical neighborhood in New York.
But urbanists debate whether the demography of a private development pinned specifically to upscale shopping and dining will actually invite the true diversities of metropolitan life, while retailers weigh the risk that upstairs residents with eyesore tastes in window curtains could ruin their sales image below.
Santana Row's developers are giving stores the option to dress the residents' windows above, in certain buildings. The 6,000-square-foot Gucci may, if it chooses, install blinds in the apartments that will display retail logos when pulled down, said Marc McQuain, the retail development manager -- an ultimate brand extension that may or may not bother residents, depending upon the strength of their shopping allegiances.
"At the end of the day, it's a shopping center," said Barbara Lamour, 29, touring with her father, Will Heiduk, a retired engineer. "It's not a community. It's a business."
Santana Row, though it will have street mimes and strolling mandolin players, will not have public parks, day care or senior-citizen centers, schools or community boards. And its retail tenants will be well tailored to the tastes of residents whose incomes will support the proposed rents -- $1,500 to $10,000 a month. Dean & DeLuca, not Safeway, will be the corner grocery. Santana Row will have no church, but there will be an imported 18th-century French chapel, selling flowers.
Lifestyle villages are rapidly eclipsing in scale and civic posture earlier, smaller residential-shopping developments like Mizner Place, in Boca Raton, Fla., built in 1988. The Streets of West Chester in suburban Cincinnati and Birkdale Village, a 52-acre shopping and residential community outside Charlotte, N.C., have also broken ground in the last year. Housing is also being integrated, as a second phase, into many of the 25 existing open-air, upscale shopping malls that developers call "lifestyle centers," to convert them to villages.
A PricewaterhouseCoopers report on shopping malls issued last year estimated that 18 percent of the nation's 2,800 malls are dead or dying as commercial ventures. It cited aging malls' inability to compete with newer malls that provide a stronger draw with movies and other recreation, and increasing dissatisfaction among suburban shoppers bone-tired of highway trips and traffic. Lifestyle centers, many planned to include residences, are replacing them. Santana Row, which sits at an intersection with two other malls, is being built on the site of the former Town and Country Mall, now the mud of its new Main Street.
With one third the retail space of existing regional megamalls, which have a million square feet or more, these hybrids exclude "big box" department stores like Macy's as anchors, considered mass-market merchants, preferring higher-end chains like Williams-Sonoma, which owns Pottery Barn.
Small examples of centers with retail and residence integration, like Phillips Place in Charlotte, developed in 1997, have succeeded at maintaining a high level of the right, exclusive retail tenants and a high level of resident occupancy -- 90 percent at Phillips Place.
"There is 'city' life, and there is 'some' life, and there is 'no' life -- the suburbs," said Dr. Keoni Udarbe, 34, who lives in a one-bedroom apartment above Cradle and All, a baby-goods shop at Phillips Place. "If I need to have a dinner party, I can walk to Dean & DeLuca." Dr. Udarbe, a psychiatric pediatrician who moved from New York City, had no problems with the urban character of his new home, including the December toy drive in the courtyard and the week of ho-ho-hoing below his balcony. "But it's not like living in the city. I lived in the city -- and this is not close."
Christopher Cole, a director of development on the East Coast for Terranomics Development, a retail development company based in New Jersey, said that interest in projects like Santana Row "is driven by municipalities wanting urban centers, where you live and shop in the same neighborhood."
Susan F. Shick, the executive director of the San Jose Redevelopment Agency, which rezoned Santana Row's land to allow both housing and shops, said, "When a developer comes in with more retail -- and high end -- why would you say no?" Centers like Santana Row, she said, can create a profitable synergy of uses for developers and a high tax base for the neighborhood, but also, potentially, a hellishly high density of people and cars at a single site.
In Rochester Hills, Mich., the Village at Rochester Hills, a lifestyle center now being built, was not allowed residences in its plan largely because of the congestion they stood to create.
"The whole area's bursting at the seams," said James Fielder, vice president for acquisitions for Robert B. Aikens & Associates, the developer. "It was shot down in discussions with the municipality. I didn't think it had a snowball's chance it would go through."
What gives developers any confidence that there is a market for shopping mall villages?
"This is the American cultural response to boredom with the suburbs," said Alex Krieger, chairman of the department of urban planning at the Harvard Graduate School of Design. "Clothing suburbia in urban mannerisms, for a market of people who think it's funky to have restaurants and shops downstairs -- it's a great marketing gimmick, but it's pretend urbanism."
"What the developers don't bank on," he added, "is that if it succeeds, those folks above Banana Republic and Pomodoro's will start complaining about longer shop hours, liquor licenses, pedestrian traffic. It's succeeding now because it's a novelty."
Retailers also question the idea's basic equations.
"For developers it works, because it adds a good-sounding thing to the economic package," Howard Lester, chairman of Williams-Sonoma, said. "But I don't think residential means a heck of a lot to retailers. I need 80,000 households to drive a Pottery Barn or Pottery Barn Kids." Mr. Lester, who is not joining Santana Row because he already has shops in a mall across the street, added, "I don't know that the fact people are living above makes it more attractive to me as a customer."
On a recent Sunday at Santana Row, a dozen shoponauts stomping up the concrete steps to view model apartments presented a diversity of opinion.
"It's going to attract single people, with fewer attachments," said Karen Dalal, 33, who lives in a ranch-style house a mile away. "I mean, I have a couple of dogs. I'm not going to bring them into a community like this."
Laura Ward, 32, on tour with her partner, Brent Gregersen, 31, said, "For me, personally, because I have two children, it just doesn't seem like it will be right."
Neither dog runs nor playgrounds are in the plans at Santana Row.
But there will be a Starbucks and a Chili's and 19 other restaurants, said Steven J. Guttman, chairman and chief executive of Federal Realty Investment Trust.
"It's a good example of how the market for something as mundane as housing has changed from a good that somebody buys to a package of services, only one of which is a residential living space," said Peter Francese, founder of American Demographics magazine.
"The people doing this have realized that 'it's the amenities, stupid,' " he said. "What do people want in a lifestyle -- not what do people want in a four-walled box."
Robert Gibbs, a retail consultant who helps developers incorporate urban thinking into suburban projects, says that aging baby boomers might well prefer the mall as a mailing address.
"They're coming onto the market looking for smaller multifamily luxury housing in town," he said. "They spent their lives in suburbs, driving their kids to soccer. They want to be able to walk to shops and restaurants. Their tax advisers are telling them they don't have to own a home -- because they don't need the tax deduction -- but to sell the four-bedroom $400,000 empty nest, put the money in the bank, rent a $2,000 apartment and live on interest."
Mr. Gibbs added dryly, "The smarter new shopping centers know this."
Ms. Franz, the software consultant, wasn't packing up house just yet.
"This is huge -- it's like a mall," she said, looking up Santana Row's dirt avenues. "How do you find comfort living at the mall?"

HEADLINE: British Industrial Icon Is Joining Exodus Trend 

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: MALMESBURY, England 

 BODY:
When he created the no-wheel wheelbarrow and went on to invent the no-bag vacuum cleaner, Britons tended to look upon James Dyson as just one more in a tradition of inventors -- eccentric but harmless.
 Then, when Mr. Dyson, who is now 54, turned his iconoclastic ideas into a privately held business with sales of $316 million in 2000 and an estimated value of $700 million, the perception shifted. The inventor became an icon of innovative Britain. His surname has become a brand and has been imprinted on the eight million Dyson bagless vacuum cleaners his company has sold since 1993. 
 Now, though, Mr. Dyson has assumed another persona. Having said he would never abandon the land that nurtured him, Mr. Dyson announced this month that he planned to close an assembly line here and shift production of all his vacuum cleaners to a much cheaper Asia. The move will eliminate 800 of the 1,800 jobs at his six-year-old plant near this ancient market town 100 miles west of London, saving payroll and other costs as Mr. Dyson prepares to introduce his products into the United States market this summer. Labor unions have accused him of betrayal -- a charge that rankles with him.
"Survival is what's going on here," Mr. Dyson said in an interview. "I put $:40 million of my money into this business to try to make manufacturing work here. But I have to regard the law of economics. If we are to survive as a business, we have to go where manufacturing is economical. I am not betraying anybody."
Mr. Dyson's decision has illustrated a malaise in the British economy that has left economists pondering whether the land that created the Industrial Revolution is finally saying farewell to manufacturing quicker than its European neighbors. In the last three decades, manufacturers have seen their share of Britain's annual output cut in half, while services like banking or restaurants have prospered in a new kind of economy that has given Britons jobs, low interest rates and huge spending power without, so far, fueling inflation.
"The country as a whole is in a two-speed economy where the consumer economy is roaring away and manufacturing is in a deep recession," said Eric Britton, an economist with Oxford Economic Forecasting, a consulting concern. "It is a feature of developed economies that the manufacturing sector tends to go down. But that has been far more accelerated here than in France or Germany."
That shift is cited as one reason, by some tallies, Britain is ahead of the global game. Over all, the British economy is expected to grow about 2 percent this year -- sluggish but still more nimble than either the United States, Japan or the European Union, which buys around 60 percent of Britain's exports. Just recently, the bullish housing market pushed the average price of a house in Britain beyond the psychological barrier of $:100,000 ($142,000) after prices soared by at least 17 percent last year -- eight times the rate of inflation -- giving Britons the same confidence the stock boom of the 1990's gave Americans.
The British "are able to sustain a high level of consumer credit because they have a large comfort factor in the value of their properties," said David Brown, the chief economist at Bear, Stearns here.
While much of Continental Europe struggles with unemployment, British joblessness is down to about 3.2 percent. Interest rates are at a 34-year low. Taxation, which is higher than in the United States, still takes far less from paychecks than in the Continental European economies.
But that is only one side of the story. Britons may have jobs, but they work the longest hours in Western Europe and their productivity ranks way behind the levels achieved in the United States, France or Germany. Their public services -- railways, hospitals and schools -- are creaking after decades of underinvestment. And, from a land once labeled by Napoleon as a nation of shopkeepers, Britain has become a nation of shoppers: consumer spending accounts for a full 60 percent of the economy.
Contrast that with the old-fashioned business of making things to sell. Last year, manufacturing shed 150,000 jobs -- while service industries like call centers added almost 230,000 jobs -- as factory output shrank by 5.4 percent and the sector's share of the nation's economic activity fell below 20 percent. 
But does it matter?
So long as consumers continue to spend the way they are doing -- stores recorded an average increase of 7 percent for the year-end holidays -- growth, too, will continue. But so will the amount of debt incurred by the average household.
On average, British householders owe 109 percent of their annual income, including mortgages, up from 92 percent in 1998. Those figures might not seem especially troubling -- nowhere near as ominous as their equivalent during the country's late 1980's boom, which led to recession. But, according to recent figures from the Office of National Statistics, both unemployment and inflation have begun to increase. That puts pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates. Higher interest rates, increasing costs and fewer jobs, in turn, would reduce borrowing and make repayments more expensive.
"The rate at which consumers are running up debt is not sustainable," Mr. Britton at Oxford Economics Forecasting said. But many economists argue that no one is losing too much sleep. Except, of course, manufacturers, who argue that the decline of their businesses is so advanced that it may be irreparable, leaving the country perilously dependent on a fragile service economy. Indeed, some manufacturers argue that their industry has already reached what one called a "subcritical mass" from which it cannot recover.
That argument has been reinforced by the high costs of doing business in Britain at a time when the pound's strength against the euro makes British exports to the European Union expensive. "Europe is our main export market and the country's main export market," Mr. Dyson said. While the pound has weakened against the dollar, it has maintained its strength against the euro. "That's really damaging," he added.
Also, expenses in Britain are at least 30 percent higher than in parts of Asia, where Mr. Dyson already manufactures some of his vacuum cleaners and where he will soon manufacture the rest, leaving his research and development team, a washing machine assembly shop and main office staff at his plant here.
By moving production to Asia, he said, his aim is to be closer to suppliers and to pare down costs in advance of his marketing in the United States, which he estimates will cost $20 million to $30 million. The move to the United States is crucial, he said, because America accounts for around 85 percent of the world's sales of upright vacuum cleaners.
But shifting production out of Britain will be one more blow to a broader decline in a culture of manufacturing. "No one really wants to make anything," Mr. Dyson said. "Engineering and manufacturing are very unsexy."

HEADLINE: NEWS WATCH: GAMING; 
Economist Finds Value And Fixed Books in Online World

BYLINE:  By Lynn Harris 

 BODY:
Tracking phantom subsidiaries is one thing. For a real accounting challenge, try balancing the books for an entire virtual world. 
 Edward Castronova, an economist at California State University at Fullerton, recently published an economic analysis of the virtual world Norrath, the locus of EverQuest, Sony's popular online fantasy role-playing game. 
 His analysis, titled "Virtual Worlds: A Firsthand Account of Market and Society on the Cyberian Frontier," not only examined Norrath's internal marketplace but also determined that its gross national product per capita was the 77th-highest in the world, right between Russia's and Bulgaria's. One unit of Norrath's currency, the platinum piece or pp, , is worth more than the yen. Mr. Castronova's own character avatar made a living by selling "misty acorns" to "rich people" for 8 pp each. "Now I can buy a nice hat," he said. 
Then there's the Enronian side of the game: an offline black market for Norrathian goods in very real dollars, which some players are prepared to spend. Since EverQuest items are Sony's intellectual property, selling them for American currency is considered theft. Nonetheless, in a survey by Mr. Castronova, 45 percent of the respondents said they knew someone who had traded Norrathian goods for dollars. 
Virtual worlds should not be dismissed as geek fringe, he says. If nothing else, they make money. That's better than many other Internet ventures. Lynn Harris

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares Regain Some Recent Losses, With Dow Up 2%

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Investors took advantage of lower prices from a two-day sell-off and sent the Dow Jones industrial average up nearly 200 points yesterday.
 They traded a little more cautiously in technology issues, which were troubled by reports of improper accounting at Computer Associates. 
 The blue-chip Dow gained 196.03 points, or 2.01 percent, to close at 9,941.17, rebounding from declines totaling 256.85 points in the previous two sessions.
The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 24.96 points, or 1.43 percent, to 1,775.57. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed up 14.64 points, or 1.35 percent, at 1,097.98. 
Advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange surpassed those declining by more than 3 to 2. Volume rose to 1.45 billion shares.
Depressed stock prices have served as a catalyst for buyers in the last few weeks, though trading has been dominated by selling on fears about weak business and a lack of credibility in corporate bookkeeping in the wake of Enron's collapse.
Analysts said many of the gains yesterday also grew out of short-sale covering as investors who had bet prices were headed lower were forced to buy stocks to cover their positions. The prevalence of short sellers in the market is another sign of investors' lingering pessimism.
"We're beaten up pretty good," said Larry Wachtel, market analyst for Prudential Securities. "So, every now and then we lift up."
Shares of Computer Associates International, the software maker, plunged $4.40, to $20.91, on reports that federal prosecutors were investigating whether the company overstated sales and profits to inflate its stock price. The company said it was unaware of an inquiry and had not been contacted by the authorities.
I.B.M., which had dropped on reports questioning its accounting, slipped 23 cents further yesterday, to $99.31.
But the lower prices helped buyers at least temporarily set aside some accounting concerns. The biggest gain among Dow stocks came from Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, which increased $3.73, to $117.10. Merck, another Dow component, rose $2.01, to $61.26. A White House aide was quoted as saying that the administration would propose that officials of a planned Medicare drug-card program negotiate for discounts directly with drug makers, rather than with pharmacies.
DuPont gained 82 cents, to $46.33, after Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown raised its recommendation to strong buy from market perform. Such upgrades helped other stocks, like Circuit City, which climbed $2.21, to $24.32, after Merrill Lynch raised its near- and long-term recommendations to strong buy from buy.
Among technology producers, Oracle rose 72 cents, to $15.51, after a Banc of America analyst upgraded it to buy from market perform.
The market was little influenced by a report that consumer prices rose 0.2 percent in January after dipping 0.1 percent in December. --------------------

Treasury Prices Decline
(By Bloomberg News) -- A bond rally stalled for a second day yesterday as expectations of economic recovery prompted investors to buy stocks, drawing cash away from fixed-income securities.
The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 6/32, to 99 28/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.89 percent from 4.87 percent on Tuesday. The price of the 30-year bond declined 4/32, to 99 24/32. Its yield rose to 5.39 percent from 5.38 percent.
"Investors seem to be embracing the recovery story a bit more," said Kevin Flanagan, a fixed-income strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of four-week bills:

(000 omitted in dollar figures

Price: 99.886
High Rate: 1.720
Coupon Yield: 1.749
Low Rate: 1.670
Median Rate: 1.710
Total applied for: $59,861,410
Accepted: $25,135,570
Noncompetitive: $20,176
The four-week bills mature on March 21.

HEADLINE: Trying to Catch Up To a Hungry Beetle; 
Invading Tree Pest Fights Tough

BYLINE:  By DIANE CARDWELL 

 BODY:
It has been here for at least a decade, quietly chewing its way through the city's beloved maples and elms, leaving barren neighborhoods and parks in its wake. First discovered in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, it appeared in Queens, Long Island and Manhattan, before finally, disappointingly, wreaking its telltale damage within the stone walls of Central Park, uncovered at the end of last month. 
 Even as teams of inspectors try to scour every vulnerable tree in the city and scientists race to develop ever more sophisticated methods of search-and-destroy -- from sexual lures to computerized eavesdroppers -- officials are discovering just how formidable the Asian longhorned beetle can be. 
 Asked what the best hope was for eliminating the beetle from native soil, David Lance, an entomologist at the United States Department of Agriculture's plant protection lab on Cape Cod, said, giddily, "Well, just beat it to death with as many sticks as you can, basically." 
But those sticks have thus far proven elusive. "At this point, there is no question that the U.S.D.A. and the state are doing everything in their power," said E. Richard Hoebeke, the Cornell University entomologist who first identified the distinctive black-and-white beetle here. But he added: "Not a whole lot has changed in the six years we've been fighting this animal. We're a little better at finding it, but we haven't discovered that silver bullet to eliminate it." 
Eradication efforts have at times progressed more slowly in New York than in Chicago, the only other North American city to have uncovered infested trees. Experts predict that Chicago will be first to get its population under control, discovered about two years after New York's, although, Mr. Hoebeke said, "Chicago is not out of the woods yet, no pun intended."
Chicago, which was able to learn from the New York experience, was the first to use tree climbers to comb the upper branches, as opposed to relying heavily on ground surveys with binoculars. In New York, tree climbers began working comprehensively just last year, and have since discovered infestations in trees, like the two maples in Central Park, that had already been examined from the ground, heightening the worry among researchers and officials that there are many more pockets of infestation to be found.
"Being No. 1 isn't always so great," said Christine Markham, the national Asian longhorned beetle program director for the U.S.D.A., adding that it took time to amass the information and resources to carry out an effective battle plan. By the time the Chicago infestation was discovered, officials were already aware of the potential damage. Because of that, and because of Richard M. Daley, the mayor of Chicago, known as an ardent protector of trees, that city was better able to coordinate its attack from the onset, Ms. Markham said.
"When we first started, we weren't operating on a shoestring, we were operating on dental floss," said Joseph P. Gittleman, a U.S.D.A. official who has overseen New York City's eradication efforts practically from the start. "We had six or eight people, we were working out of our cars, we didn't have our own binoculars, you didn't have your own anything," he said, explaining that the Asian longhorned beetle "doesn't have the same kind of political clout as something that affects citrus or wheat," crops whose damage has immediate and obvious economic consequences.
In addition, not only is New York's infestation older and more deeply entrenched than Chicago's, officials say, but New York's streetscape, with its many courtyards, attached row houses and rooftop gardens, is less accessible to inspection equipment, making for more tedious hand-to-foreleg combat. And then there is the congenital squinty-eyed stance of the typical New Yorker, who is less likely to open the door for a nonuniformed visitor asking to look at that big willow out back.
But experts say that the beetle could be devastating. Since the first findings in Greenpoint, more than 3,500 New York City trees, among about 7,000 nationwide, have been sacrificed to the insects, officials say, and the threat extends to more than 1 billion trees belonging to host species like maple, birch, horse chestnut, poplar, willow, elm and ash. 
Experts said that in China, the beetle's native home, its population exploded in fields of poplar that had been planted to reforest vast tracts of land. The wood from the trees, riddled with Asian longhorns, was then used in packaging goods for transport, thus unwittingly creating an export system for the pest. 
It is not clear whether the beetle first arrived here by air or sea, but in its wake, the United States imposed requirements that solid wood packing material coming from China and Hong Kong be treated to ensure that it is free of insects. Still, no such prohibition yet exists for wood packing material from Europe, where infestations have recently been discovered. And, as Mr. Hoebeke explained, there are more threats hovering at the borders. 
In August, an infestation of citrus longhorned beetle, a close cousin of the Asian longhorned, cropped up near Seattle in an open-air quarantine center holding imported bonsai maples, and there is evidence that the beetles spread miles away. "Again, what we've been learning is that in addition to solid wood, much of these bonsai are also insect-infested," Mr. Hoebeke said.
Experts say that these infiltrations are inevitable in the face of increasing international trade, which Mr. Hoebeke estimated brings in several new exotic species a year.
But the battle of the beetle rages on. Following Chicago's lead, officials injected healthy trees in parts of Brooklyn, Queens and Manhattan last year with a pesticide compound, Imidacloprid, as a preventive measure. Officials hope that the compound, spread throughout the bark, will kill the adult females nibbling the trunks to lay their eggs. 
Scientists are also trying to develop chemical lures, some that mimic whatever attracts males and females to one another, others that mimic what attracts them to certain types of hardwoods, that could be used in traps. But that avenue is limited. Mr. Lance said that it appeared unlikely that the insect responds to attractants over a long range as do some insects, but he held out hope for developing one that works short-range.
More promising, perhaps, is an acoustical device with far-reaching applications that could detect the insect chewing inside the tree, even pinpointing its stage of development. Researchers have already experimented with such a device in New York last year, in which sensors are attached to the tree and then the recorded sounds are fed through a computerized neural network. They hope to have a prototype of sorts ready to test this spring. 
Michael T. Smith, a research entomologist on the project, said that they were working toward creating a sensor that could detect chewing sounds in the top branches from the base of the tree, obviating the need to climb. It costs a lot to have screeners in New York, he said, "and if they have to climb, it really costs."
But for the time being, climbing is the only tried and true method. Dozens of surveyors, sometimes climbing out of a two-foot-square bucket in rough weather to reach branches soaring 75 feet, perform these jobs each weekday throughout the city, looking for often-camouflaged egg sites or dime-sized exit holes.
As a squad of inspectors balanced themselves high overhead in Central Park one recent weekday morning, Mr. Gittleman explained that when trees are cut down, they are replaced with other varieties as a matter of practicality. "There's no prohibition on planting host material," he said, adding that it costs $600 to $800 to put a tree in the sidewalk and that the city had been vigilant about diversifying its stock.
Still, he said, he and many of the officials in the project are pained to condemn even a single tree.
"To be out in some neighborhood where you find an infestation in an American elm that's survived everything else, and then that thing gets it," he said, "it's heartbreaking."

HEADLINE: Panel's Ruling on Royalties Is Setback for Web Radio Services 

BYLINE:  By AMY HARMON 

 BODY:
The fledgling Internet radio industry was handed a setback yesterday as a government arbitration panel said online radio stations should pay recording companies nearly 10 times what the Webcasters had proposed for the songs they play.
 The panel's long-awaited recommendation was considerably less than the rate the recording industry had suggested. But several Webcasters said that if the proposal passed the next hurdle -- approval by the United States Copyright Office, which set up the panel -- it might mean an end to free radio on the Internet. 
 "Over a million people play our free service every month," said Dennis Mudd, chief executive of Musicmatch, "and it's going to be impossible to even come close to breaking even with these new rates. Radio on the Web should be able to serve the same function that radio over terrestrial airwaves performs, and it's not going to be able to do that because of these rules."
Under the panel's proposal, commercial Webcasters would pay royalties of 0.14 cent per listener per song. Internet transmissions of regular AM or FM radio broadcasts would cost 0.07 cent per song. Rates would be lower for noncommercial broadcasters, at 0.02 cent for radio rebroadcasts and 0.05 cent for Internet-only programming.
The rates would be effective retroactively, to 1998. The rules also require Internet radio stations to count their users and report their geographic locations. Some Webcasters say fulfilling that requirement would violate their privacy policies.
Analysts said the ruling would help dispel the uncertainty that has hovered over the Internet radio business since a 1998 federal law mandated that Webcasters -- unlike conventional radio stations -- pay royalty fees for the songs they broadcast.
"At least this will allow them to create business models," said Aram Sinnreich, a senior analyst at Jupiter Media Metrix, an Internet market research firm. "The question that remains, though, is: How many online broadcasters are going to be able to develop business models that can handle this kind of structure?"
Internet radio, which seemed to provide the proverbial level playing field because no one had to own a broadcasting tower or be part of a media conglomerate to compete effectively, has proved more difficult than it initially seemed. Advertisers have been hard to come by, and bandwidth costs have remained fairly high. Industry executives said yesterday that the new rules would hasten the fallout and consolidation already under way among Webcasters.
Still, music industry representatives have argued that Internet entrepreneurs need to find a way to make a profit while fairly compensating artists and record labels for the use of their work. Several Webcasters, including Musicmatch and RealNetworks, offer successful subscription-based radio services, for instance.
"Artists and labels, who have supported these new businesses from the start with their music, are one step closer to getting paid," said Hilary B. Rosen, the president of the Recording Industry Association of America, which represents the major labels.
Jonathan Potter, executive director of the Digital Media Association, said the recommendations would probably lead to more interactive offerings, which allow a user to select a list of songs to be played, because the panel rejected the recording industry's request to impose a premium on such services.
Representatives from both sides can continue to press the Copyright Office for proposal changes for 60 days. Eric E. Van Loon, a member of the three-person arbitration panel, said that the panel had received more than 14,000 pages of testimony from more than 50 witnesses.

A bull market and a boom in 401(k)'s must mean fat pensions? Think again.

BYLINE:  By Jeff Madrick; Jeff Madrick is the editor of Challenge Magazine and of a new journal of social health, Indicators. Both publications are based in Armonk, N.Y. He is an adjunct professor of humanities at Cooper Union. E-mail: challenge@mesharpe.com.

 BODY:
IT was the great bull market of the century. It began in 1982 and sent the Dow Jones industrial average up some tenfold. So how many households were able to build their nest eggs to a level of wealth they could once only dream about?
 To listen to some advocates of "defined contribution" retirement plans, like 401(k)'s, just about anyone could have done it. These plans allowed workers to escape from stodgy old-fashioned fixed-benefit plans, save what they could and manage their own money by buying mutual funds or even individual stocks. Meanwhile, their employers typically matched or even exceeded their contributions. And Washington conferred the same tax deductions on these plans as on the old defined-benefit plans. 
 But here are the stunning facts. Two-thirds of American households have not increased their retirement wealth from pensions at all since 1983 (compared with households led by people of comparable ages in that year) or have experienced a drop in the value of their pensions. Prof. Edward N. Wolff, the New York University economist, calculated the value of both defined-contribution and defined-benefit plans, based on data from the Federal Reserve and the Internal Revenue Service.
It turns out that in 1998, 65 percent of all American households headed by a person between 47 and 64 had either the same pension wealth, adjusted for inflation, than households headed by people in that age group did 15 years earlier, or even less. For the household right in the middle of the pack -- the median -- retirement wealth fell 13 percent from 1983 to 1998. The figures include neither the market boom of 1999 and 2000 nor the bust of 2001.
What disguised the facts before was that overall gains in these retirement accounts were large. The problem is that these gains went disproportionately to the wealthy. For example, according to Professor Wolff's calculations, the households that had more pension wealth than 80 percent of all others -- those in the 80th percentile -- increased their retirement wealth by 19 percent. That was a respectable amount, but hardly outstanding, given the booming stock market. The big gains went to the really rich. Those in the 95th percentile experienced a rise in pension wealth of 176 percent in 15 years -- a nearly threefold increase. 
So what is going on here? Defined-contribution plans, like 401(k)'s, are supposed to give employees of all incomes an opportunity to earn better returns. Meantime, as William Wolman and Anne Colamosca point out in their book "The Great 401(k) Hoax," available this spring from Perseus Publishing, corporations no longer have those pesky long-term liabilities to employees to worry about. But the investment risk is all on the worker. Defined-contribution plans have replaced defined-benefit plans in company after company across the nation, Mr. Wolman and Ms. Colamosca note. Professor Wolff's figures reinforce the point.
The great promise does not seem to have worked. Even when adding up the current value of Social Security benefits, pension wealth and a household's net worth -- the value of a house and other major assets, minus all debt -- Professor Wolff finds that wealth at retirement is down a remarkable 17 percent for the typical household headed by someone 47 to 64. The figures for those over 65 are more positive, but not by much.
Why haven't defined-contribution plans provided more retirement security in this era of soaring stock prices? One problem is that people often manage their investments poorly. Enron employees were urged to place most of their eggs in one basket: Enron stock. But when Enron collapsed late last year, the retirement savings of many were wiped out.
Some workers also take too little risk. This experience should serve as a warning to those who advocate the privatization of Social Security, a move that would let individuals manage a portion of the program for themselves. 
But there are more important factors. The first is that wages grew slowly or fell for many people over these years, and pension programs are usually based on wages. Even the value of Social Security fell in these years as a result of poor earnings growth for so many workers. Also, some companies abandoned pensions altogether, and many workers lost pension assets when they lost their jobs.
A second factor is that some defined-contribution plans are more generous for those nearer the top of the income spectrum. For example, employers may contribute a greater proportion of a high-level worker's income to the pension plan.
A third factor may be obvious, but it is not widely understood. Because these contributions are usually based on a percentage of income, they are regressive by design. The more you make, the bigger the company contribution, even when the proportion matched is the same. The large early investments can compound rapidly over time.
Finally, defined-contribution plans require more voluntary savings on the part of workers. The point is to induce workers to save more. But the philosophy founders on the simple facts. It is far easier to save when you are making a lot of money than when you are making a little. The great advantage of Social Security as a retirement system is that its benefits tend to equalize retirement incomes. But the defined-contribution plans are adding to inequalities.
The upshot is that many Americans will have less income as a proportion of their current earnings when they retire. In an expansion of his research, published by the Economic Policy Institute in Washington, Professor Wolff calculates that only 57 percent of households will be able to replace half or more of their current earnings level during retirement. In 1989, the percentage was 70 percent. Only one in four households will be able to produce $1,000 in retirement income each month, even when including Social Security benefits.
When average wages failed to grow in the 1980's and the first half of the 1990's, one response was always that workers were compensating for the poor performance because they now owned a piece of a rising stock market being propelled by higher corporate profits. It is still widely claimed that the movement toward defined-contribution plans helps that happen for typical workers. But the benefits of these plans are related to earnings, and now the hard empirical facts support early fears.
Washington gives corporations big tax breaks for defined-contribution plans. But despite a soaring stock market, which will almost surely not be repeated any time soon, not even those in the 80th percentile increased their retirement wealth substantially, and most American households fell behind. The Americans who have benefited most are the rich.

HEADLINE: Grant Program Meant to Keep A Population Downtown 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
The group overseeing the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan is expected to approve today a $200 million program of grants to downtown residents or those who move downtown and commit to staying there for two years, city and state officials said yesterday.
 The program proposed by the organization, the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, would make individual grants of up to $12,000 over two years. The grants would be tied to a resident's proximity to ground zero, and would be available to anyone who lives or moves into a residence below Canal Street. 
 The payments would be calculated as a percentage of monthly rent or monthly mortgage and maintenance payments, according to state and city officials, who spoke about the plan yesterday on the condition of anonymity. 
After approval of the plan, the development corporation must, by law, accept public comment before enacting it. The corporation is also expected to adopt other programs today to aid individuals and businesses affected by the attack on the World Trade Center and to discuss proposals for a temporary memorial to victims. 
The grants to residents would be the first proposals enacted by the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, which was appointed in November by Gov. George E. Pataki and then-Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to plan and supervise the redevelopment of the neighborhoods in southern Manhattan. 
The development corporation has drawn some criticism for not moving speedily enough on plans for a memorial, whether temporary or permanent, or to offer aid to businesses and residents. 
But with the election season under way, Mr. Pataki and various other state officials have been eager to get some of the $2.7 billion allocated by Congress for rebuilding projects into the hands of residents and people involved in small business.
"It is vitally important that we work to ensure that residents remain in Lower Manhattan and people move into Lower Manhattan," Mr. Pataki said in a statement, adding that he was "committed to making this happen."
But Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, who represents the residents of Battery Park City and other neighborhoods in Lower Manhattan, said the proposed compensation was "relatively insignificant" when compared with residents' losses.
Mr. Silver recommended compensating property owners for the loss in market value on their holdings in addition to the offer of assistance with mortgage payments. 
Richard S. Lefrak, president of the Lefrak Organization, which owns the Gateway Plaza complex in Battery Park City, said in an interview that the proposal was "a very smart idea to get the area repopulated."
Along with many other landlords in the area, his company instituted rent reductions of 15 percent to 30 percent to residents who remained in their apartments after Sept. 11. He said that he would not raise rents. "I have hundreds of apartments to rent," he said. "I'm not in a rent-raising mode right now."
The proposal sets two levels of aid for residents. Those renting or owning property below Chambers Street and west of Broadway, including all of Battery Park City, would receive 30 percent of their monthly rents, or of their mortgage payments and maintenance charges, up to $12,000 over two years. The maximum a resident could receive would be $500 per month toward monthly mortgage payments or rent of $1,667 or more.
Outside of the immediate impact zone, new or current residents of homes anywhere else below Canal Street, or Rutgers Street on the far eastern side of Manhattan, would be eligible for up to $6,000 over two years. 
All residents would receive a minimum grant of $2,000 over two years, or $4,000 for those in the immediate impact zone. Also, anyone who lived in either area on Sept. 11 would get a one-time bonus payment of $1,000, officials said.
The money for the grant program is part of the $2.7 billion set aside last year by Congress in two separate appropriations for the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan. 
The first, a $700 million package aimed primarily at businesses, was directed through the Empire State Development Corporation, the state's economic development authority. Plans for the dispersal of that money were approved by the agency in January and will be reviewed by the Lower Manhattan agency tomorrow.
A further $2 billion package to be administered directly by the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, which is a subsidiary of the Empire State agency, was signed into law in January. 
Under the legislation, no less than $500 million of the total $2.7 billion appropriation is supposed to be made available for individuals, nonprofit groups or small businesses.
Last week, the Battery Park City Authority announced its own proposal to offer $15.6 million, or about $1,845 per household, to Battery Park City residents as disaster relief. A spokesman for the authority said yesterday that the proposal, which could be put into effect by June, had received verbal approval from the governor and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and should not be affected by the new Lower Manhattan grant program. 
The authority also said it planned to pursue $13 million in payments it is owed by condominium owners in Battery Park City, who have withheld payments for their ground leases over living conditions in the area.

HEADLINE: Deal's Loose Ends Are Tied to Global Crossing 

BYLINE:  By SIMON ROMERO with GERALDINE FABRIKANT 

 BODY:
Even as Global Crossing was careering toward a financial collapse last fall, its chairman and a member of its board were arranging a complex side deal with a Singapore investment firm that has ties to an Asian alliance now trying to buy Global Crossing out of bankruptcy.
 The deal, which the two executives conducted without officially informing other board members, may have given the chairman, Gary Winnick, and the director involved, Steven J. Green, opportunities to benefit in ways not available to other executives or to creditors and shareholders of Global Crossing, a giant communications company. 
 Nor was the deal disclosed to creditors or shareholders last month when a $750 million joint offer for Global Crossing's assets was made by Singapore Technologies Telemedia and Hutchison Whampoa, one of Hong Kong's biggest companies. Singapore Technologies is wholly owned by the same government-owned company, Temasek Holdings, that effectively controls the Singapore firm in which Mr. Winnick and Mr. Green invested. 
Failure to fully notify the board when they made their Singapore deal, or to disclose it in the bankruptcy proceedings, were serious lapses on the part of Mr. Winnick and Mr. Green in the view of some corporate management and bankruptcy experts. 
"You would want to be certain the chairman was acting responsibly with the shareholders of Global Crossing," said Michael Useem, professor of management at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. "That would require more thorough disclosure of what was happening."
Yesterday, Mr. Winnick, through a spokesman, and Mr. Green, in a telephone interview, confirmed the details of their Singapore deal, in which the two men acquired a 13.4 percent stake in the Singapore investment firm, K1 Ventures, for about $25 million. But they both said there was nothing inappropriate in their handling of the transaction. 
Mr. Green said that he had informally told other directors of the K1 Ventures investment but that he did not tell them about the firm's corporate ties to Singapore Technologies. A spokesman for Mr. Winnick said the board had knowledge of the K1 Ventures deal but that it was not a subject of formal discussion. 
In any case, the transaction shows how Mr. Winnick was cementing relationships in the Far East while Global Crossing executives were still publicly affirming that the company was not in danger of collapsing. "Bankruptcy is not a possibility at all," John J. Legere, the chief executive said in an interview last October, a month after Mr. Winnick and Mr. Green made the Singapore investment.
The role of Mr. Green in the deal is noteworthy because until February 2001 he was the United States ambassador to Singapore, appointed by the Clinton administration in 1997.
As Global Crossing's financial problems were mounting and its share price was collapsing in 2001, Mr. Green joined the board of the company's Asian unit in April, became a member of the Global Crossing board in August and then, in September, made the investment with Mr. Winnick in K1 Ventures.
Each man put up about $12.5 million for his K1 Ventures stake -- Mr. Winnick through his investment company, the Pacific Capital Group, and Mr. Green through his investment unit, Greenstreet. Mr. Green became the chairman and chief executive of K1 Ventures. 
The chairman and founder of the Hong Kong bidder for Global Crossing, Hutchison Whampoa, is the billionaire Li Ka-shing, who has been acquainted with Mr. Winnick for some time and was introduced to Mr. Green by Mr. Winnick last year. 
Global Crossing's bankruptcy filing three weeks ago was the fourth largest on record, based on the $22.4 billion in assets the company listed. It completely wiped out the value of shares held by investors, whose stock had been worth $64.25 a share at its peak in 1999. And holders of $12.4 billion in debt are likely to come away with no more than pennies on the dollar. 
Mr. Winnick, however, has already taken at least $730 million out of the company, based on stock transactions since Global Crossing went public in 1998. 
Mr. Winnick and Mr. Green said they would not receive any direct financial benefits through their K1 Ventures investment if the Asian companies acquire Global Crossing. And both men rejected the suggestion yesterday that their involvement in K1 Ventures might be a veiled effort to retain influence at Global Crossing if it winds up in the hands of Singapore Technologies and Hutchison Whampoa. 
"It would not give Gary or me a back-door entry into ownership of Global Crossing," Mr. Green said in a phone interview from his office in Miami. Mr. Winnick said through a spokesman that he did not expect to get any equity in Global Crossing from his investment in K1 Ventures. 
It is not clear, though, whether Mr. Winnick would remain Global Crossing's chairman or whether Mr. Green would remain on its board, since such decisions would be up to whoever winds up controlling the company. But if either man has a desire to remain involved, his indirect links to Singapore Technologies and his association with Mr. Li might give him channels for making his desires known.
Melinda Liu, a spokeswoman for Singapore Technologies, said today that it operated as a separate company from K1, although both are ultimately controlled by Temasek. Ms. Liu added that Singapore Technologies was still interested in acquiring Global Crossing. Hutchison Whampoa was unavailable for comment.
As Global Crossing's financial situation was reaching a crisis last fall, Mr. Winnick and Mr. Green traveled to Singapore at least twice, in November and December, to meet with representatives from Singapore Technologies Telemedia, according to people close to Global Crossing.
Moreover, Mr. Green held a dinner party in Shanghai in October, during the gathering of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation group, at which the dinner guests included representatives from Singapore Technologies, those people said. 
Mr. Green, who has known Mr. Winnick for 20 years, said he checked with the State Department after leaving his ambassador's post last year and was told it would be fine to conduct business in Singapore on the condition that he not represent Singapore entities in dealings with the United States government. A State Department spokesman declined to comment yesterday on Mr. Green's Singapore dealings.
The takeover proposal by Singapore Technologies Telemedia and Hutchison Whampoa has created other complications, with some members of Congress voicing concern over the acquisition of such a large telecommunications company by foreign concerns.
The proposed takeover and Global Crossing's bankruptcy filing have also delayed the awarding of a $450 million contract to provide fast Internet services to the Defense Department. Global Crossing won that contract last year, but protests from other bidders caused the Defense Department to withdraw the award. 
The Defense Department had been expected to announce the winner of the contract last month, just days before Global Crossing filed for bankruptcy. But bidders now say the Pentagon has delayed the awarding of the contract until next month.

HEADLINE: Metro Matters; 
For Red Cross, A New Round Of Complaints

BYLINE:  By JOYCE PURNICK 

 BODY:
THE American Red Cross just cannot seem to catch a sustained break. The first time it got in trouble, for its plan to reserve some Sept. 11 donations for future needs, it made a comeback by pleading guilty, toppling its president and reversing policy. 
 Now it is being criticized again, accused of being excessively generous in some cases, stingy in others and frequently inconsistent. This time, the head of the charity's New York operation pleads a decisive not guilty. 
 "I don't think we've been imprudent or dumped money," Robert M. Bender Jr., chief executive of the American Red Cross in Greater New York, said in an interview yesterday. "In a few cases maybe we're overly generous. In a few cases maybe somebody defrauded us. But the reality is, New York really needed help, we needed to have a massive effort here, and I believe we have had a massive effort."
That it has. In the last five months, the national Red Cross reports, its Liberty Fund has raised $917 million and donated $552 million to 53,457 individuals and families affected personally or economically by the terrorist attacks. It will spend almost all of the remaining $365 million by September, most on survivors of attack victims and those seriously injured.
Even the Red Cross's harshest critics commend its fund-raising. But not how it goes about giving away the money.
A recent Metro Matters column describing the Red Cross's efforts to give thousands of dollars to people who live near the attack site -- including affluent people who said they were not profoundly affected by Sept. 11, even some reluctant to accept the aid -- provoked several phone calls and e-mail messages from New Yorkers unhappy with the charity.
They complained that different Red Cross workers told them different things, that they were denied benefits given to others in similar circumstances, that they were told they could get only $250 if they suffered economic damage while others got several thousand dollars several weeks back.
"If it was fair and equal, I could accept it, but it isn't," said Richard Apple, a photographer living on Varick Street who was denied help because of a rules change, though neighbors in the same building did get financial aid.
Mr. Bender said, "There is no $250 maximum per se," but he and, later, an adviser, clarified that statement: each person who claims economic damage from the attack can now get only $250, and an additional $150 for each family member.
ANDREW KASHYAP, a legal advocate with the Urban Justice Center who works in an assistance center, said that has in fact been the policy since Feb. 7. The problem, he said, is that earlier, assistance was based on economic need and sometimes amounted to thousands of dollars, and the change came with little notice. Originally, the Red Cross gave people as much as three months of living expenses. 
Mr. Kashyap said many families he counsels applied before Feb. 7 but had to provide more documentation. They returned after the new policy went into effect, "and were stuck getting one-tenth of what they would have received before," he said, blaming the high turnover of Red Cross caseworkers for some of the confusion.
He and other advocates said that the recent decision by the Red Cross, the Salvation Army and the Sept. 11 Fund to set a March 8 deadline for applying for emergency grants had also confused many applicants. 
Mr. Bender said that decision was intended to encourage people to seek aid from other programs so that the charities could focus the remaining resources on survivors and those seriously injured. 
As for other concerns, Mr. Bender cited the scope of the charity effort. "When you have 59,000 people working on a relief operation, you are going to have some variances in their performance, but we are talking about a massive operation, and I think the program has been articulated and thought out."
Asked if some people had received too much aid, had even cheated the system, while others received too little, Mr. Bender said he thought that in the wake of emergencies, the charity made decisions based on the "stated needs" of people and that it was not its policy to analyze their finances. 
"We essentially tried to be generous because the American people gave us that money to be generous," he said. "We didn't try to be foolhardy. Do I think the Red Cross here and nationwide responded very well? Yes. Do I think that's been without error? No. But I think we have a record here that is proud."

HEADLINE: Consumer Prices Increase Slightly 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 20 

 BODY:
Higher prices for gasoline, medical care and some food items contributed to a mild rise in consumer inflation in January, the government said today. But prices for clothing, cars, lodging and computers all fell, providing shoppers with some bargains. 
 The Consumer Price Index rose 0.2 percent last month, meeting expectations, after dipping 0.1 percent in December, the Labor Department reported. 
 Excluding energy and food prices, which can swing widely, the "core" rate of inflation increased 0.2 percent in January, up slightly from a 0.1 percent advance the month before.
For the 12 months ended in January, consumer prices rose 1.1 percent, the smallest increase since the 12 months ended in December 1986.
"Inflation remains completely under control," said Bill Cheney, chief economist at John Hancock Financial Services. "Goods and even services are cheap, and businesses are eager for sales at almost any price. Bargains abound."
Higher gasoline prices caused much of the increase in the Consumer Price Index, economists said. After falling in November and December, gasoline prices rose 2.7 percent in January, the biggest increase in four months. Still, gasoline prices remain 22.7 percent below the levels of a year ago.
Food prices rose 0.3 percent in January, after being flat in December. Higher prices for vegetables, fruit and pork outweighed lower prices for beef, veal, poultry and dairy products.
Prices for medical care rose 0.5 percent in January, up from a 0.3 percent increase in December. The advance was led by a 0.9 percent increase in prices for hospital and related services, the sharpest rise since December 1999.
Clothing prices fell 0.7 percent in January. New-car prices were down 0.6 percent, the biggest decrease in nearly 15 years.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS; 
New Life for Networks

BYLINE:  By BILL CARTER 

 BODY:
Their audiences continue to decline at a steady pace, their main source of revenue, advertising, has gone through one of the worst years in recent memory, and hit programs seem more elusive and expensive than ever. Yet in many ways the big broadcast networks are in better shape this week than they have been for a decade.
 A decision by a Federal appeals court in Washington on Tuesday that could lead to a reduction, or even an end, of limits on the ownership of television stations is only the latest positive turn for network television, an industry that has had a seven-year streak of improving regulatory conditions. Only a decade ago, the networks were reading persistent reports of their imminent demise, invariably accompanied by dinosaur metaphors. 
 "Deregulation has clearly given the networks a future they did not have back when people like Larry Tisch were slashing costs and just trying to survive," said Tom Wolzien, a media analyst with Sandford C. Bernstein. 
Indeed, when Laurence A. Tisch owned CBS in the late 1980's and early 1990's, limitations on station ownership and costly battles with affiliated station partners made the networks appear to be shrinking giants with little leverage and even less hope of continuing to generate profits.
At the time several senior NBC executives were quietly predicting that CBS would possibly go out of business entirely and the network industry might be reduced to as few as two big players.
But heavy lobbying and easing of fears about network monopolies have chipped away at a generation of regulations that were imposed as far back as the 1940's. In 1995, the Federal Communications Commission gave the networks permission to own and take profits in the programs they broadcast. More recently, the commission gave the big station owners, like the networks, the right to own two stations in the same city. Now thanks to this week's ruling, they may even be able to get into the business of operating cable systems. All these moves give the network business, if not a new lease on life, at least far better chance of survival.
"Are these changes positive for the networks? Absolutely," said Thomas Rogers, the chairman of Primedia, and formerly the executive vice president of NBC.
Among the advantages Mr. Rogers said a network could realize were gaining leverage over smaller stations, thus guaranteeing that more of its programming would be carried; increasing its negotiating power when it sought to buy syndicated programs, like "Judge Judy," for the stations it owns; and increasing its ability to cross promote programs on both stations and the network. For example, the more stations NBC owns the more times it can promote the "Tonight" show in the late local newscast.
Mr. Rogers warned that these changes "help only on the margins." The reason, he said, is that the fundamental economic model for network television still remains the same -- advertising is the main source of revenue. This would have to change before the networks could definitively be said to have weathered the storm of ever-increasing competition from alternative channels on cable and now satellite TV, he said.
But one senior network executive, who has fought most of the regulatory battles of the past 20 years, said: "While you may still argue that the network business is in decline, because of audience erosion, you have to say the regulatory changes moderate the slope. The decision this week helps -- a lot."
Specifically, the executive said, expanding the number of stations a network can own will surely boost a network's profits. Stations are by far the most profitable part of the network business, usually generating profit margins of 50 percent or more.
Already yesterday several station group owners, including Paxson Communications and Sinclair Broadcast Group, were escalating talks to sell stations, executives close to the discussions said.
The rules the appeals court sent back to the Federal Communications Commission for review this week -- rules the court called "arbitrary and capricious" -- had limited the networks and other big station holders to owning stations that reached no more than 35 percent of the nation's population. Networks sign up affiliate stations to broadcast programming to the rest of the country.
If a network added stations and its reach grew to 50 percent of the country, that would have impact across a wide range of its businesses. As the senior network executive put it: "Profits at the stations' level would previously have been taken in by affiliates while they were broadcasting your own network programming. Now you're taking in that revenue. That's a very good thing."
For example, in a show like NBC's "E.R.," local stations sell 4 or 5 commercials in a hour while a network sells about 15 commercials.
At the same time, a network, with the increased leverage of controlling enough national distribution all by itself to satisfy most advertisers, would have no further incentive to pay affiliates to carry its programming. The networks have been trying to end this practice, called compensation, ever since it started in the early days of network radio.
A network with that much national distribution could also make or break a syndicated program, meaning it could demand a financial stake in virtually every syndication show.
The networks have argued that all these changes have been necessary for mere survival, usually making the point that the rules were antiquated, set up at a time when the three networks controlled more than 90 per cent of the national television marketplace. Now they command just under 50 per cent -- and they are losing about 5 percent of their audience each year.
Affiliated station owners have argued that the networks have already become dangerously powerful, and allowing them to gobble up more stations would diminish the power of local broadcasters to resist network mandated policies. This could have special repercussions in news coverage, said Alan Frank, the chairman of the National Affiliated Stations Alliance.
He said his group was counting on the F.C.C to offer the appeals court a better rationale for keeping the limits on station ownership as they are, or else for Congress to step in. "We have a strong feeling that Congress wants that rule retained," Mr. Frank said.
But network executives expressed high confidence that the F.C.C., which is now led by a chairman, Michael E. Powell, who is known to be a free-market and deregulation advocate, will at the least push the limit up to owning stations that reach 50 percent of the country. Asked yesterday whether it would be difficult to keep the rules on the books, Mr. Powell said, "All I know is, it's really hard now."
Still, that may not solve all the questions that still loom over the network business. Networks, for example, are taking on enormous losses on rights to sports like professional football and baseball. The National Basketball Association just concluded a deal with ABC that will actually place most of its games on cable, where subscription fees will help defray the enormous cost.
"I don't think the deregulation makes the future for the networks necessarily buoyant," Mr. Wolzien said. "Dispersion of audience is still going on everywhere."
That is one reason why networks now occupy just one corner in much bigger media companies, like Viacom, which owns CBS; Walt Disney, which owns ABC; and the News Corporation, which owns Fox. There, no matter what their own profitability, they serve as outlets for the programs developed by the production studios owned by the companies, and they create followings for programs that can be reused on other outlets the companies own, like cable.
Because NBC -- which is owned by General Electric -- is the one network not owned by a larger media company, it is usually the one mentioned as a likely takeover target. With AOL Time Warner now freed by the court from the regulation that prevented it from owning broadcast stations in cities where it also owns cable systems -- like New York -- speculation began immediately this week that AOL Time Warner would be interested in buying NBC.
Mr. Wolzien, who originally joined in that speculation, said yesterday that it could be just as easily turned around since NBC is owned by an entity that is actually bigger than any of the media companies.
"I think you could make the case that G.E. is the one that could go out and buy AOL, if the finances were right," he said.

HEADLINE: Newly Hot Manila Exchange Tries TradingAll Day 

BYLINE:  By WAYNE ARNOLD 

DATELINE: MANILA, Feb. 20 

 BODY:
Anyone who thinks the Philippines is suffering from its new front-line status in the war against terrorism has not met Jojo Gonzales or Joseph Madrid.
 In July, as their employer, Merrill Lynch, seemed close to abandoning that market, the two teamed up with three colleagues and bought Merrill Lynch's Manila operations. The proud new owners of Philippine Equity Partners replaced the Merrill Lynch signs on the office just three weeks after Sept. 11. Manila's benchmark stock index duly plummeted. 
 But this year, even as the arrival of American Special Forces has highlighted the security problems, stocks here have climbed more than 25 percent. With a global recovery seemingly around the corner, foreign funds are returning here to sniff out bargains, and trading levels have more than doubled. Emboldened by the market's revival, the Philippine Stock Exchange reintroduced afternoon trading today for the first time since the 1970's.
"Timing is everything," said Mr. Madrid, who heads the firm's sales department. Early in the rally, commentators connected it to the American military presence and its potentially chilling effect on the country's time-honored kidnapping industry.
As foreign money keeps trickling in, however, it has become clear that the market is more than a passing fad. "It was a dog for two years, but every dog has its day," said Mr. Gonzales, who heads Philippine Equity's research department.
After nearly three years of economic and political torpor, the Philippines has gained an unusual forward momentum. Benevolent weather last year fueled a boom in the critical agricultural sector, and a renewed enthusiasm overseas for government bonds has enabled the central bank to slash interest rates. Despite weak exports, the economy grew 3.4 percent last year.
The Philippines is not alone. Both Thailand and Indonesia, the wallflowers of international portfolio investment last year, suddenly find themselves belles of the ball.
The logic for investing in the region, said Hugh Young, managing director at Aberdeen Asset Management Asia, is simple. "If the U.S. recovers, Asia should recover at a faster rate." Reopening after lunch is part of a move by the exchange to shake off cobwebs in preparation for its own listing next year.
No one here seems to recall exactly when or why afternoon trading was stopped. Eddie T. Gobing, the exchange governor, recalled a time of thin trading volumes, a likely symptom of the political climate. Armed forces were fighting communist rebels in the north, Muslim separatists in the south. They still are.
Trading stocks became a leisurely affair, with traders starting work at 9:30 and leaving at noon. When the country's two stock exchanges merged in 1992, trades were computerized, but the day stayed short.
Now with an added session from 1 to 2:30, traders are bracing for a more hectic life. "The famed two-hour broker lunches are out the window," said Pam Go, a trader for KGI Securities, who opted to eat lunch at her desk today.
Traders said it was too early to tell whether the longer hours would lead to more business. Investors exchanged $27 million in shares today, slightly less than during Tuesday's shorter session. The benchmark index dropped roughly 1 percent.
Even in its heyday in the mid-1990's, the exchange handled only about $100 million in trades a day, Mr. Madrid said. But enthusiasm for stocks was shaken further by the administration of President Joseph E. Estrada, culminating in 2000 with an insider-trading scandal that implicated Mr. Estrada.
Merrill was not the only foreign brokerage firm to head for the exits last year. But it was the biggest, accounting for as much as 8 percent of daily trades that had dwindled to just $7 million in turnover each day. 
Merrill has promised to use Philippine Equity Partners exclusively for its trades here. The firm is already profitable, Mr. Gonzales said. (The partners have agreed not to disclose how much they will pay Merrill). "Things have actually exceeded our expectations," he said.

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY; 
Europe Offers A Patent Law For Software

BYLINE:  By PAUL MELLER 

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Feb. 20 

 BODY:
The European Commission today proposed a law for software patents that is more limited than laws in the United States and Japan.
 The law, which would replace 15 different regulations in the 15 countries within the European Union, would allow patents only for software applications of a technical nature, and it would not permit patents on business methods. 
 The United States and Japan allow patents on a much wider range of software, and they both permit patents for business methods. Business methods include innovations like one-click purchasing, for which the online retailer Amazon received a patent in the United States in 1999. Amazon used the patent to get an injunction against use of a similar purchasing feature by a rival, Barnesandnoble.com, but an appeals court lifted that injunction this year. 
"The commission thinks that allowing a patent for the 'one-click' purchasing technique goes too far in restricting trade," Frits Bolkestein, the commissioner in charge of the internal E.U. market, said today.
He described the commission's proposal, which would require the approval of the European Parliament and the member nations, as a compromise between the stance taken in the United States and the position of those who back "open-source software," which is published widely without patents so that others can contribute to it and augment it with their own new features. 
Mr. Bolkestein, in anticipation of a hostile reaction, said, "We will take complaints from the U.S. on the chin."
Criticism is also expected from within Europe, not least from the European Patent Office. "The E.P.O. has of late taken a more restrictive approach, issuing patents to software applications themselves," Mr. Bolkestein said.
The E.P.O. can register patents for every country in the union, but the system is expensive because each country charges a fee.
The E.P.O. will eventually have to bow to the directive, if it is passed, as expected. But even then there could be some confusion, argued Ari Laakkonen, a lawyer with the British law firm of Linklaters & Alliance.
In 1999 the E.P.O. board of appeal granted I.B.M. a patent for a software application with no clear technical nature. "The I.B.M. case could raise conflict-of-law issues between the E.P.O. and the member states of the E.U.," he said.
A representative of the Business Standards Alliance, a group backed by Microsoft, told Reuters that the E.U. proposal "departs from what we had hoped to see."

 Re "Workers Held Hostage," by Paul Krugman (column, Feb. 19): 
 The members of my union, Local 147 of the Tunnel Builders of New York, are all suffering. We have all exhausted our 26 weeks of unemployment benefits. There is some work for us on the horizon, but that's exactly where it is for now: on the horizon.
What are we to do while the powers that be take their time deciding whether or not to extend benefits to workers?
It's obvious that the bureaucrats in Washington have lost touch with the common people and their needs!

HEADLINE: China Is Treated More Gently Than North Korea for Same Sin 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 20 

 BODY:
Days before President Bush arrived in China, American intelligence agencies told him that despite China's pledges to help battle terrorism Beijing continues to supply missile technology to Iran and Pakistan, the two countries that are also North Korea's primary missile customers.
 While President Bush has repeated his accusation that North Korea is "evil" -- citing its missile sales, its efforts to develop weapons of mass destruction and its treatment of its own starving populace -- his aides say this his tone about China's continued sales of missile parts and technology will be more muted. 
 In briefings for reporters before Mr. Bush left Washington, White House officials declined to say who buys from China. They noted that Beijing had signed an agreement in November 2000 to halt missile-related sales that could help any country deliver nuclear, biological or chemical weapons. So far, China has not carried out that accord. 
"There is a tremendous skittishness about discussing this plainly," said one senior administration official who has seen much of the intelligence about China's sales. 
"But the important point," the official said, "is that the Chinese profess to have a policy of nonproliferation, they insist they don't export missile technology and yet we still keep seeing evidence of shipments to countries that are also seeking weapons of mass destruction." 
Mr. Bush plans to raise these issues with President Jiang Zemin during his two-day visit to Beijing, officials say, but in general terms and probably without specific reference to Pakistan or Iran.
Pakistan has long depended on both nuclear and missile technology from China, which Beijing has readily supplied as part of its effort to build a counterforce to India.
Iran has also been a major customer of Chinese missile technology, and it is eager to obtain more of China's solid-fuel rockets, which are considered more reliable and more mobile than the liquid-fuel rocket technology that Iran has acquired from North Korea.
More than a year after taking office, the administration remains deeply divided about how to deal with China -- as an economic and counterterrorism partner or as a strategic competitor. Its reluctance to make details of the Chinese arms sales public reflects that tension, administration officials and outside experts said.
Bubbling just beneath the surface is the question of China's continuing relationships with Iran and, to a lesser degree, Iraq and North Korea. "There there is a continuing debate," one official said, "over how to deal with friends of the 'axis of evil.' "
According to several government officials who have monitored China's missile sales, the shipments to Pakistan and Iran continued unabated after Sept. 11, and after a trip by Mr. Bush in October to Shanghai, where he briefly raised the issue in a meeting with Mr. Jiang. 
"The situation didn't get worse," one official said. "It just didn't get better."
In talks with the Chinese, Bush administration officials have repeatedly asked them to issue comprehensive export control regulations, under the agreement struck by the two countries in the last months of the Clinton administration. So far, no such regulations have been published, though the Chinese have told American officials that they will be issued soon.
Ten days before the Sept. 11 attacks, the administration imposed sanctions against a Chinese company, the China Metallurgical Equipment Corporation, that it said was involved in missile exports to Pakistan. 
It was never clear whether the Chinese leaders knew of the transaction or whether it had emerged from the complex of unregulated Chinese enterprises, many of which have connections to the military. President Bush never mentioned the case, or North Korea's sales to Pakistan, when he met with President Pervez Musharraf at the White House last week, aides said.
Nor is Mr. Bush expected to discuss directly with China another case in which the United States recently imposed sanctions, this one involving two Chinese companies and one person for shipments to Iran of equipment that could be used to make chemical weapons.
Because Chinese officials regularly deny knowing of such transactions, Mr. Bush and Mr. Jiang can be a bit elliptical in their talks. Mr. Bush can press Mr. Jiang to crack down, and Mr. Jiang can argue that he is trying, with the usual condition that China is a big country and its leaders are often the last to know.
"This is one of the big differences between North Korea and China," said Robert J. Einhorn, the former assistant secretary of state for nonproliferation, who negotiated the missile agreement with China. "North Korea sells the technology for hard currency, and the government is involved in every sale."
"The Chinese system is more complicated now," added Mr. Einhorn, now a scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies here. "They have made political commitments to nonproliferation, but they also have some longstanding commitments to old customers, and some in China say, 'We're going to honor them, no matter what the Foreign Ministry signed.' "
But within the administration, some still complain that Mr. Bush has softened the strong language he used about Beijing during the campaign, when he frequently referred to China as a "strategic competitor." That language disappeared from the presidential lexicon before Mr. Bush's trip to Shanghai in October.
A few officials have argued unsuccessfully that the president should put China on notice about its proliferation, the way he has notified Iraq, Iran and North Korea that he would not tolerate the spread of missile technology or weapons of mass destruction.
But tangling with China, officials point out, is far more complex than denouncing the other three. American businesses have virtually no dealings with Iraq, Iran or North Korea, by law. But such relationships with China are blossoming, especially since the country's recent entry into the World Trade Organization.
Moreover, administration officials talk eagerly these days about the steady liberalization of life in China, of the country's gradual moves toward the rule of law and the spread of elections for local offices.
Proliferation, they argue, is an important issue, but as Secretary of State Colin L. Powell noted recently, it is just one issue in a broad relationship with China. With North Korea, in contrast, it is, as one of Mr. Bush's aides said today, "the main event."

HEADLINE: Treasury Chief Accuses World Bank of Harming Poor Countries 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 20 

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill said today that the World Bank had driven poor countries "into a ditch" by lending instead of donating funds to fight poverty, and he sharply criticized allies for failing to back a plan to revamp aid policies. 
 None of the United States' counterparts in the Group of 7 industrialized nations has endorsed a proposal by President Bush that would convert half of all development loans to grants despite months of lobbying by Washington. 
 Britain, France and Germany insisted at a recent negotiating session that Mr. Bush's proposal could hobble the World Bank, the main lender to poor nations. 
In a well publicized speech last July, Mr. Bush called grants like these "compassionate conservatism at the international level."
His argument was that it made more sense to donate money for health, education and sanitation projects than to burden poor countries with debt.
Mr. Bush said he would like to see "up to 50 percent" of the World Bank's $6 billion in annual outlays for the poorest countries provided in grants, compared with about 1 percent now.
European countries have remained cool to the idea, arguing that making countries pay back the money, even over 40 years at low interest rates, instills discipline among borrowers and lenders. Some officials also say they fear that the Bush administration's proposal could undermine the World Bank by forcing it to give away its capital. 
European leaders have said they could support converting as much as 10 percent of the bank's loans to grants. Canada and Japan have indicated that they would back converting 16 percent. Both are far from the American goal of 50 percent.
Speaking to experts at the International Institute of Economics in Washington today, Mr. O'Neill sharply questioned the logic of Europe's position. "I say the hell with it," he said. 
"Somebody tell me a good reason for 10 percent."
Mr. O'Neill said the United States had indicated some flexibility in what percentage of aid should be made in the form of grants, but suggested that 10 percent was too low.
"It's hard for me when I look at primary education and I look at the stage of underdevelopment for billions of people, it's hard for me to say, well, let's do post-conflict countries and let's do a little H.I.V./AIDS and keep it under 10 percent," Mr. O'Neill said.
American officials had hoped to persuade allies to remake the World Bank's antipoverty programs before Mr. Bush attends a development meeting in Monterrey, Mexico, next month. But officials involved in the talks say any overhaul will be much more modest than Mr. Bush and Mr. O'Neill once envisioned.
Mr. O'Neill expressed frustration at the difficulty of changing the World Bank, which he suggested had failed to achieve its desired goals of alleviating poverty at least in part because it contributed to a debt crisis among poor countries. 
Lending agencies have "driven them into a ditch" by extending loans that borrowing nations have trouble repaying, he said, adding that heavy debt loads frighten away global investors.

HEADLINE: Mountain of 90's Debt Looms As City and State Feel Pinch 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA and JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

 BODY:
New Yorkers say their region stands alone in all sorts of ways, from the fabled baseball franchise in the Bronx to the cutthroat capitalism practiced on the floor of the stock exchange. But few citizens of this sprawling city and state know it is the undisputed leader in a less-exalted arena: government debt.
 New York City and New York State are far and away the largest debtors in the nation, outside the federal government. The city has $42 billion in loans outstanding, and the state has $38 billion. No one else is even close, the State of California running a distant third, at $25 billion. 
 Now, as New York navigates the narrow fiscal straits brought on by recession and the Sept. 11 attack, and surpluses have given way to yawning deficits, those debts loom larger, fiscal monitors say. 
The state and city each spend about $4 billion a year on debt payments, limiting the money available to weather a crisis without cutting essential services or resorting to fiscal gimmicks that push today's costs onto future generations.
In announcing his budget plan last week, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg proposed that the city take on even more debt, $1.5 billion, to help cover a $4.7 billion budget gap. That would mean selling bonds to cover day-to-day expenses, something the city has not done since the fiscal crisis of the 1970's.
Mr. Bloomberg acknowledged that doing so was an extraordinary step, and all but pleaded with bond-rating agencies to accept the tactic, promising that borrowing to reduce coming years' deficits would not become an annual tool. The mayor also wants to refinance some debt, to reduce the interest payments over the next several years to get through this tough stretch.
Borrowing money can play an important, valued role in government -- one accepted by even the most conservative critics -- when it is used to pay for high-cost, long-lasting assets like bridges, railroads and power plants that would otherwise take decades to buy. The question, then, is not whether to borrow, but to what degree.
There is no question that Mr. Bloomberg inherited a dire situation, much of which was beyond any official's control, but there are those fiscal monitors and budget watchdogs who contend that the new mayor was left without any cushion because of the mountain of city debt accumulated and the high spending that occurred during the economic boom.
Mr. Bloomberg's predecessor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, and Gov. George E. Pataki, both Republicans, took office in the last decade as fiscal conservatives, promising to bring discipline to what they characterized as spendthrift governments. Both increased spending sharply after their first few years in office, and cut taxes simultaneously, as did governments around the country. The state built up significant reserves for the first time in generations. 
The two also presided over enormous borrowing, approved by legislators, Democrat and Republican, even as many cities and states around the country instead used the boom to tame their debts. State debt has risen by about one-third, or $10 billion, since Mr. Pataki took office seven years ago; city debt rose by more than half, or about $15 billion, in Mr. Giuliani's eight years.
In other words, critics on the left and right say, in New York, the good times were paid for partly with borrowed money.
Pataki and Giuliani officials have argued that the state and the city had considerable needs during the last 10 years, with quite a few projects on the runway that had been stalled by the recession of the early 1990's. Among the projects paid for in part with borrowed money, they said, were new schools to meet rising enrollments, repairs to highways that had suffered years of neglect, a fleet of new subway trains and buses, major additions to university campuses and a raft of new government buildings. 
"Governing is more complicated than just looking at a single issue," said Carole Stone, Mr. Pataki's budget director. She cited tax cuts, spending, debt and the building up of reserves, and said, "You have to balance these four important areas." 
A high-ranking official in the Giuliani administration said the city's capital needs, especially for new schools, drove much of the new debt. "If you use the surplus to pay down debt, it wouldn't be available and you would have to raise taxes or cut services," the official said. "The mayor believed one of the mistakes of the fiscal crisis was that they neglected their infrastructure. You can't have it both ways. People want to have space in classrooms and they want their debt burden to be low."
For his part, Mr. Pataki did prepare for this downturn, squirreling away more than $3 billion in various funds. The state is using that reserve now, making it possible to survive the fiscal year that ends March 31, and the year after that, without deep cuts to most programs. Using some of that money to pay off debts might have done more for the state's long-term financial health, but without question, the state's savings are a tonic for its immediate ills.
The city does not have even that going for it. It hit the recessionary wall with reserves of only a few hundred million dollars, because of a wide range of factors, including a heavier debt load and less control of its own destiny (the state abolished the city's commuter tax in 1999, wiping out half a billion dollars a year in revenue).
Many fiscal monitors say government debt should not have grown at all during the late 1990's, a time of big surpluses, and that the failure to curb it will make climbing out of the current morass harder.
"The boom that ended last year was a unique opportunity to get things under control, and they blew it," Tom Carroll, president of the conservative group Change New York, said of the Giuliani and Pataki administrations. "There wasn't the fiscal discipline we had hoped to see overall, but on debt, there was no discipline at all."
The state comptroller, H. Carl McCall, a Democrat who is running against Mr. Pataki, has long railed against the borrowing practices of the city and the state. "We have not managed our debt well," he said. "We severely hampered our ability to respond to the kind of fiscal crisis we are about to face."
But Governor Pataki and others defend the government's financial decisions, noting reforms and changes that lowered some of the risks of borrowing. Both the city and state have abolished the worst borrowing practices of years past, as when the state "sold" prisons and highways from one agency to another, borrowing to raise the cash.
In the late 90's, improvements in New York State's finances led Wall Street firms to raise the state's bond ratings, saving the state hundreds of millions of dollars a year, and Mr. Pataki pushed measures through the Legislature that have begun the process of getting borrowing under control.
"We've had credit rating upgrades, and we passed debt reform, the first significant debt reform legislation the state has ever seen," Governor Pataki said in a recent interview.
Even so, the sheer amount of debt continues to rise each year, in both Albany and City Hall. In the context of the state's overall finances, the state's debt picture is about the same as when Mr. Pataki took office. For the city, with no new debt control measures and no rating upgrades, the picture is markedly worse than when Mr. Giuliani took over.
"The problem is a culture that has existed in New York for a long time, that doesn't exist in most other places," said Robert A. Kurtter, vice president for state ratings at Moody's Investors Service. "In New York, debt has tended to be seen as a free good. People see the benefits, but not the costs."

More Loans During Boom
The conventional wisdom among some budget watchdogs is that government should resort to heavy borrowing only to get through a crisis, and should take advantage of surplus years by paying off debts and using cash more than bonds to build highways and railroads.
Most governments try to follow that pattern, and many states and cities did so during the 90's. Virginia, for instance, had years in which it paid out of pocket for its capital projects, borrowing not a cent. Many of the most heavily indebted states and cities eased those burdens by paying off old loans ahead of schedule. Louisiana cut its debt load by more than half.
New York kept racking up loans during the boom, relying more on bond sales than on surplus cash for capital projects, and headed into this recession more heavily weighted down with debt than at the end of the last one.
Fiscal monitors and government officials say the conventional strategy of going deeper into debt to muddle through the downturn would only worsen things, and could harm the credit ratings of the city and the state.
"I don't think either one has much capacity to take on additional borrowing," said Robin L. Prunty, a director in the public finance department at Standard & Poor's.
New York City's debt problem is considerably more severe than the state's, and getting worse.
When Mr. Giuliani took office in 1994, the city spent 15 cents out of every dollar it took in -- outside of state and federal grants -- to make payments on its bonds. Today, the figure is above 17 cents, and fiscal monitors project that it will top 19 cents later this year, boxing in Mr. Bloomberg as he tries to find ways to close the budget gap.
"To the extent debt service is rising, you are excluding other spending, on police, teachers, parks," said Ronnie Lowenstein, deputy director of the Independent Budget Office, a city-financed budget monitor.
City officials often protest that the city's finances cannot be compared with those of other cities, because New York City embodies what, in most places, would be three separate entities: city, county and school district, each with the power to tax, spend and borrow.
A year ago, Moody's published a report that tried to account for those overlapping roles, comparing the nation's 30 largest cities. It concluded that New York City residents were carrying a heavier local government debt load -- more than $4,000 per person -- than the people of all but two other cities, Washington and Austin, Tex. In most cities, the burden was less than half that. The rating agencies agree on the city's credit, giving it lower grades (A2 from Moody's, and an equivalent A from S.& P.) than those of nearly every other large city.
In the last few years, even as the city ran annual surpluses in the billions of dollars, Mr. Giuliani sharply accelerated borrowing, increasing the city's capital budget by half, to $6.7 billion this year. Not paying cash for those projects when the cash was available, many budget experts say, was foolhardy.
"We never used any of these surpluses to deal with long-term debt," said Alan G. Hevesi, the former city comptroller who, like Mr. Giuliani, left office on Dec. 31. "They were always rolled into the next year."

A Matter of Priorities
Mr. Pataki took office in 1995 as an updated supply-sider, putting deep tax cuts ahead of every other priority. That meant budget cuts in his first years, including spending less on the "pay as you go" contribution to capital projects, and borrowing more to make up for it. In his first term, he showed little interest in taming debt.
"We were facing a $5 billion deficit and a state economy that was in a shambles," said Michael McKeon, Mr. Pataki's communications director, "and the governor believed that the most important thing to do to get things going again was to cut taxes."
Then, as the governor ran for re-election in 1998, Tom Golisano, the Independence Party candidate, spent $13 million on ads mocking Mr. Pataki on a single issue: rising debt.
After easily winning a second term, Mr. Pataki took the first real steps toward bringing the state's borrowing under control since Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller put it on a steep upward trajectory 40 years earlier.
Over the last few years, Mr. Pataki has paid off $1 billion in high-interest bonds ahead of schedule. In 2000, he won passage of a law that will eventually restrict state borrowing, though the version approved by the Legislature did less than Mr. Pataki wanted, and it will have little effect for several years. The curve charted by state debt has begun to flatten out, and administration officials predict that it will stop rising in 2005.
Still, fiscal experts view the last several years as a lost opportunity. "It's great that they've begun to get things under control, but when you have $2 billion surpluses, that's a time to do a lot more pay-as-you-go, not to keep going deeper into debt each year," said Diana Fortuna, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a private nonpartisan group that studies city and state finances.
Standard & Poor's has raised New York State's credit rating three times under Mr. Pataki, reflecting the state's robust economic growth and healthy reserves. The current rating, AA, remains below average among the states. Moody's takes a harsher view of the state's finances, giving it a rating of A2, equivalent to an A rating in S.& P.'s system, and tied for worst among the states, with Louisiana.

Strategies and Questions
There are ways the city and state can manipulate debt for short-term advantage to squeeze through the crisis, but each of those moves carries either high risks or small rewards.
Mr. Pataki has made or is proposing several relatively small changes in the way the state sells bonds, and his office estimates that the changes would save the state $225 million in the coming fiscal year. Mr. Bloomberg plans to postpone capital projects, putting off many so that the city can reduce interest payments over the next few years. 
A big question is whether the city will sell more bonds backed by the national lawsuit settlement with tobacco companies, cashing it in up front rather than waiting for it to be paid out over 25 years. Several cities, counties and states have gone that route, and New Jersey's new governor, James E. McGreevey, plans to. But budget experts frown on the practice, because it means taking on more debt, and it rests on the uncertain prospect that the major cigarette makers will stay financially healthy for the life of the deal.
New York City was among the first to sell tobacco bonds, in 1999. Mr. Giuliani made plans to sell $2.8 billion, but the city went ahead with just $700 million. That means there is a potential pool of $2.1 billion waiting to be claimed, but the Bloomberg administration says it has not decided whether to tap it.
The Pataki administration rejected the idea of such bonds, which could have raised about $6 billion for the state. The state also resisted the temptation to stretch out repayment of its outstanding bonds, a move that buys breathing room in the short run, but can make the problem worse over time.
"Some of these changes might be good policy, but the payoff is small," Ms. Fortuna said. "And the things that would really generate a lot of money up front are risky and questionable policy. There's just not much room to maneuver."

HEADLINE: The Flipped-Over Rock 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM SAFIRE; E-mail: safire@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
What wife of a United States senator profited from her close association with a big company that did heavy lobbying of the federal government and then went bust, costing investors billions and workers their jobs?
 Why, Wendy Gramm, most recently awakened watchdogs would say, wife of the Republican Phil Gramm of Texas, previous chairman of the Banking Committee. As a director of Enron, she was on the audit committee that didn't question the fast-and-loose auditing, and (subtracting the deferred compensation that went into the tank) received about $220,000 over eight years. 
 That's peanuts, say Republicans. The senatorial wife who hit it big was Anne Bingaman, married to New Mexico's Jeff Bingaman, chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. As lobbyist for the telecommunications comet Global Crossing, which went bankrupt last month, she received $2,500,000 for six months' work during 1999. 
Both senatorial wives are accomplished executives who parlayed responsible government appointments into lucrative private positions. 
Wendy Gramm was chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Anne Bingaman was Bill Clinton's assistant attorney general for antitrust until leaving in June 1996. Her lobbying fee for delaying approval of a competitor's undersea cable still makes Beltway bandits gasp.
This juxtaposition shows that the Enron scandal is having only bipartisan political fallout; in this case, the "everybody did it" defense works. (You can bet that neither spouse will be subpoenaed and publicly humiliated by the club member Fritz Hollings at the Commerce Committee.) Because both the biggest bankrupt (Enron) and the fourth-biggest bankrupt (Global Crossing) made contributions to politicians of both parties, the resulting public disgust has been used to advance bipartisan campaign finance reform.
Enron, which mostly embarrassed Republicans, has been wrung dry in the media; the sight of the tilted "E" symbol elicits yawns from viewers. It's the telecommunications giant Global Crossing's turn in the barrel; now we'll be hearing about Clinton connections on its board and its boss's million-dollar contribution to the Clinton library. 
Especially delicious will be the examination of Terry McAuliffe, the fabled fund-raiser whom Bill Clinton insisted the Democratic National Committee take on as chairman. McAuliffe says he merely invested $100,000 in Global Crossing and sold it for $18 million, and what's the big deal? What his D.N.C. spokesman won't say is what price per share he paid before the company went public, and what that stock was worth when it went on the market -- and what he did to earn the difference. (Same question could be directed to Bush the elder.)
But after the politicians tire of wounding each other and declare a truce, we may see some overdue action on the control of financial derivatives. These are the investments, often off the books, in futures and currencies that slice and dice risk and have made instant billionaires, but whose abuse has been disastrous to investors from Orange County to Long-Term Capital Management. 
Hedge funds are supposed to spread and reduce risk; in reality, they are often used to make huge bets unknown to their institutional investors. Accountants are supposed to enforce disclosure of all liabilities, but many have become expert in the concealment of risk.
I don't profess to understand the worries some of my financial sources express about dangerous excesses in the convertible bond market, "swaptions" and ever-narrowing derivatives. But my unwillingness to break my head learning these intricacies gives the wheeler-dealers an edge. Complication and secrecy are mother's milk to them, while the average investor's best protection is full disclosure.
When you flip over a flat rock like Enron or Global Crossing, you see much panicky scurrying-about by those who like to work in the dark. For too long, new-economy corporate creeps and their accounting Heeps have hidden risk in arcane off-the-books dealing. The new S.E.C. chairman, Harvey Pitt, seems not to get it: Stop pretending it's a political scandal and start dealing with the accounting and derivatives scandal.

HEADLINE: Interest in Peace Corps Rises After Bush Plea 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 20 

 BODY:
Application requests for the Peace Corps have increased 39 percent since President Bush's State of the Union promise to fight terrorism at home with more volunteers abroad, agency officials said today. 
 Three weeks since the president announced plans to more than double the number of Peace Corps volunteers to about 15,000 in the next five years, nearly 10,500 requests for applications have been made, Peace Corps officials say, an increase of about 140 a day from just two months ago. 
 In addition, at the Peace Corps Web site, www.peacecorps.gov, traffic has risen almost 60 percent since the president's address. 
For some applicants, poor job prospects in a sluggish economy, coupled with a desire to volunteer since Sept. 11, have moved them to consider the Peace Corps, recruiters said. For others, the president's call to service on Jan. 29 was the catalyst. 
"It sparked a bug in me," Bruce Pope, 44, a recent graduate of a Roman Catholic seminary in the Washington area, said at a recent Peace Corps recruiting session here.
In urging all Americans to commit themselves to at least two years of volunteer service in their lives, President Bush created the U.S.A. Freedom Corps, to coordinate expansion of three programs, the Peace Corps, AmeriCorps and Senior Corps. 
In addition, Citizen Corps, the newly created domestic security arm of U.S.A. Freedom Corps, will enlist Americans in protecting the country from terrorist attacks. 
Interest in all four programs has risen steadily since the State of the Union address, officials for each organization say.
"You can't get anything better than having the president talk about your agency during the State of the Union," said Ellen Field, the communications director for the Peace Corps.
The initial phase of Peace Corps expansion is already taking shape. Last week, President Bush announced plans to send a team of Peace Corps veterans to Afghanistan to assess future efforts to aid in rebuilding the country. 
Volunteers are expected to return soon to regions that for years were deemed too dangerous or politically unstable, like Bangladesh and Chad, Ms. Field said. 
But critics of the expansion, including some returned volunteers, worry that sending more Peace Corps volunteers overseas in wartime may be counter to America's best international interests. 
"While it is successful to have young Americans educated about the realities overseas," said Steve Hellinger, 53, a Peace Corps volunteer in Nicaragua during the Vietnam War and now president of the Development Group for Alternative Policies, in Washington, "using them to continue to promote the United State's geopolitical and economic agendas overseas, this is going to be counterproductive." 
Still, for many prospective and confirmed applicants, an interest in the Peace Corps has little to do with politics. 
"I've always kind of had an interest," said Shon't Savage, 27, a researcher in communicable diseases in Largo, Md., clutching her application packet after the recruiting session at Peace Corps headquarters here. "I'm a humanitarian at heart."

Enron Bankers Felt Pushed To Invest in Partnerships
Bankers for Enron told a top executive of the company that they had been led to believe that they could obtain lucrative business from Enron if they agreed to invest money in outside partnerships controlled by Andrew S. Fastow, the chief financial officer, according to records of interviews with the executive.
 The statements raise the specter of improper activity in the solicitation of partnership stakes, legal experts said. Page C10. 

Two government agencies that promote American business interests abroad gave Enron hundreds of millions of dollars in loans and other assistance over the last decade. C10.

Morgan Stanley Keeps a Key Official
Philip J. Purcell, left, the chief executive of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, foiled the plan of his rival, John J. Mack, by persuading a senior Morgan Stanley executive, Walid Chammah, to pass up the offer of a top job at Mr. Mack's firm, Credit Suisse First Boston. Mr. Chammah's decision to stay at Morgan Stanley ended a protracted tug of war between the two firms and the chief executives who once called each other partner. C12.

More Good News for TV Networks
The decision by a federal appeals court in Washington on Tuesday that could lead to an end or reduction of limits on the ownership of television stations is only the latest positive turn in what has been a seven-year streak of improving regulatory decisions for the broadcast networks. News Analysis. A1.

Charges Against Insurers Dismissed
A federal judge dismissed several charges against the largest health insurance companies, but he said plaintiffs could proceed with accusations that the insurers had violated federal fraud and pension laws. C10.

Currency Losses Date Back to 1997
The losses that John M. Rusnak, a currency trader for Allfirst Financial, is accused of trying to hide with fictitious transactions had been mounting since 1997, rather than just over the last year, bank officials said. C11.

Bargain Hunters Break 2-Day Slide
Investors took advantage of lower prices from a two-day sell-off and sent the Dow Jones industrial average up 196.03 points, or 2 percent, to 9,941.17. The Nasdaq composite index rose 24.96 points, or 1.4 percent, to 1,775.57. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 14.64 points, or 1.4 percent, to 1,097.98. C12.

Chrysler Loss Is Less Than Expected
DaimlerChrysler executives said that Chrysler had lost less than expected last year and reiterated that it would break even this year. But analysts expressed frustration that the company was not more forthcoming on details of its earnings outlook for this year. Shares of DaimlerChrysler trading in New York rose $1.32, or 3.5 percent, to $36.95. C2.

In Debt Above the Rest: New York
New York City and New York State are far and away the largest debtors in the nation, outside of the federal government. The city has $42 billion in loans outstanding, and the state has $38 billion. The state of California runs a distant third at $25 billion. A1.

HEADLINE: Enron Received Many Loans From U.S. For Foreign Projects During the 1990's 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 20 

 BODY:
Two government agencies that promote American business interests abroad gave the Enron Corporation hundreds of millions of dollars in loans and other assistance over the last decade, the agencies and Congressional investigators said today.
 The Overseas Private Investment Corporation, which helps American companies win business against foreign competitors in developing nations, gave Enron $544 million in loans for five projects, starting in 1993. It also provided $204 million in political risk insurance for 10 Enron projects, starting in 1992. 
 The Export-Import Bank of the United States, a government agency that makes loans to foreign companies to help them buy goods and services from American companies, lent $675 million to companies affiliated with Enron, starting in 1993. 
Republicans said the figures showed that Enron had sought and received help from Washington long before President Bush took office and that the Clinton administration had enthusiastically helped Enron as the company undertook an ambitious global expansion in the 1990's.
Enron sought to cultivate ties to the Clinton administration in other ways. As he was about to step down as Mr. Clinton's Treasury secretary in 1999, Robert E. Rubin received a letter from Kenneth L. Lay, who was then Enron's chairman, offering Mr. Rubin a seat on Enron's board, documents released tonight by the Treasury Department show. 
The offer was contained in a letter Mr. Lay sent to Mr. Rubin on May 14, 1999, two days after Mr. Rubin announced his intention to resign. The offer was reported by The Associated Press, which obtained the documents from the Treasury Department through a Freedom of Information Act request. Mr. Rubin did not accept the offer, and after leaving the government went to work for Citigroup, which was one of Enron's biggest lenders.
Mr. Rubin "had no interest" in Enron's offer and declined it, said Michael Schlein, a Citigroup spokesman.
Last fall, as Enron was approaching bankruptcy, Mr. Rubin called the Treasury Department on Citigroup's behalf to raise the idea of the Bush administration's intervening with the credit-rating agencies. Mr. Rubin ultimately agreed that such an intervention would not be appropriate.
The Treasury Department documents also show that Mr. Lay contacted Mr. Rubin and his successor, Lawrence H. Summers, on several other issues, including Houston's effort to win tax breaks for urban renewal projects and the Clinton administration's approach to regulating derivatives trading.
The Clinton administration's efforts to help Enron in other countries was part of a broader push by Mr. Clinton and his first commerce secretary, Ronald H. Brown, to become advocates for American businesses around the world.
When he was killed in a plane crash in Croatia in 1996, Mr. Brown was on a trade mission intended to help Enron, among other companies. The Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation continued granting new loans to Enron projects through 2000.
The financing deals during the 1990's "obviously were a tremendous benefit to Enron's operation," said Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa.
"The disclosure of this information sheds light on the government's actions in support of Enron over the years," he said.
But some of the deals supported by the Clinton administration also led Enron to seek help from the Bush administration. Mr. Lay had several conversations last year with Donald L. Evans, the current commerce secretary, about Enron's troubled Dabhol power plant project in India.
The power plant, which was supported by both the Overseas Private Investment Corporation and Export-Import Bank loans, has been shut since June by a dispute between Enron and the government of the state in which the plant is situated. Vice President Dick Cheney raised the issue in June with Sonia Gandhi, the leader of India's main opposition party.
So far, Enron's bankruptcy has not resulted in any losses to taxpayers from the loans to Enron projects abroad. In most of the deals, repayment is tied to the performance of the specific projects abroad rather than to the parent company's financial health.
Of the total $675 million the Export-Import Bank lent to Enron projects, about $510 million remains outstanding, said Cheryl Crispen, a spokeswoman for the bank. She said all of the loans continue to be paid on time. 
Of the $544 million in loans from the investment corporation, $454 million remains outstanding. The loans continue to be paid back on time. Last week, the investment corporation canceled two loan commitments for Enron power plant projects in South America, saying the deadline for moving ahead with the projects had passed.
Separately, Enron announced today that James V. Derrick Jr., the company's executive vice president and general counsel, would retire on March 1. 
Mr. Derrick, 57, will be succeeded by Robert H. Walls Jr., the deputy general counsel, the company said.
Congressional investigators have raised questions about the degree of seriousness with which Mr. Derrick investigated early reports of problems with Enron's accounting.

HEADLINE: The W Scenario 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
First comes the victory parade. Later we'll find out if we won. 
 Celebrating victory well in advance seems to be the style lately. And that includes the economic front. Both the administration and many business leaders have taken a modest improvement in economic indicators as proof that the economy is poised for full recovery. They could be right -- but don't count on it. 
 The good news to date consists mainly of evidence not that things are getting better but that they are getting worse more slowly. New claims for unemployment insurance have fallen; that means fewer people are being laid off, but not that laid-off workers are finding new jobs. Industrial production has stabilized; that means that companies have worked off the excess inventory that led them to slash production in 2001, but not that demand for their products has increased.
We won't have a serious recovery until what economists call "final demand" shows substantial increases, and workers start being rehired. Where will that recovery come from? 
This has not been a standard recession, in which nervous consumers pulled back and will start spending again once they have been reassured. In fact, consumers have continued to spend freely right through the slump. So the surge in consumer demand that usually drives recovery seems unlikely. 
What drove this recession was a plunge in business spending, as companies realized that they had over invested in the bubble years. Thus far there is very little evidence that companies are willing to start spending again anytime soon. And even if they did feel like spending, banks and financial markets, spooked by the Enron scandal, are reluctant to make the money available.
The only clear force for recovery I see is the administration's military splurge. After all, even useless weapons spending does create jobs, at least for a while. Japan props up its economy by building bridges to nowhere; the Bush administration buys Crusader artillery systems and F-22's. 
Against this, there are at least three important forces that will place a drag on the economy. 
First is the impact of unemployment. The number of Americans without jobs seems to have stabilized, but their pain is growing: more and more of the unemployed have been without jobs for months rather than weeks, and a rapidly growing number have exhausted their benefits (which House leaders have refused to extend). Will consumer demand remain robust as the human toll of recession becomes increasingly apparent?
Second is the plight of state and local government. The Pentagon may be getting everything it wants, and then some, but state and local governments are desperate; they will be slashing spending, laying off workers and even raising taxes -- all with depressing effects on the economy.
Finally, there's line 47. You haven't heard about that, but you will.
Here's the story. The Bush administration didn't want to give those famous $300 rebate checks; its original plan would have pumped hardly any money into the economy last year. Under prodding from Democrats the plan was changed to incorporate immediate cash outlays. But those outlays were included only grudgingly, and with a catch: they really weren't rebates. Instead, they were merely advances on future tax cuts. 
What that means is that most taxpayers, when they reach line 47 of their 1040's, will discover that they owe $300 more in taxes than they expected. In other words, the one piece of the Bush tax cut that probably did help the economy last year is about to be snatched away. The direct monetary impact will be significant; the psychological impact, as taxpayers realize that they've been misled, may be even greater.
Many forecasters think that the impact of these drags on the economy will be a recovery that is slow and generates so few jobs that it feels more like a continuing recession. A few analysts -- notably Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley, who deserves a medal for his dogged skepticism about the "new economy" during the bubble years -- think that we're headed for a "W-shaped" or "double-dip" recession, in which we have reached a bottom but not the bottom. 
Personally, I find the pessimists more convincing than the optimists -- though any economist who honestly keeps track of his own forecasting record quickly learns to be humble. What's certain is that it's much too soon to declare victory. 

CORRECTION-DATE: March 3, 2002

 CORRECTION:
My Feb. 22 column mentioned "line 47" in this year's 1040. What I said was correct, but has been subject to misinterpretation, most of it innocent, some of it deliberate. Let me say it another way: Most people think that they received both a rebate and a tax cut. But the rebate was only an advance on the tax cut; it must be counted against the refund you would otherwise receive. Hundreds of thousands of early filers have already gotten this wrong. The effect is to give many people a rude shock, which is not what this economy needs.

HEADLINE: Economic Stimulus: A Republican View 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "Workers Held Hostage" (column, Feb. 19): 
 Paul Krugman trots out familiar class-war arguments about the bipartisan legislation that passed the House last week. 
This is hardly a giveaway to the rich, as he would have us believe.
This legislation included refund checks for those low-income families that did not qualify for a refund last year; a tax-rate cut aimed at middle-class families in the 27 percent bracket; and extended health care and unemployment benefits for those who cannot find a job.
This stimulus package has been held hostage by the Senate's partisan politics. Tom Daschle, the majority leader, seems content to move on to other legislative items. But there is no higher priority for Congress than to get people back to work.

HEADLINE: ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: PUBLIC OPINION; 
Worries About Pensions Show a Rise

BYLINE:  By ADAM CLYMER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 21 

 BODY:
Sharply growing public interest in the collapse of the Enron Corporation has spurred widespread fear about retirement accounts but has not increased hostility to business generally or generated support for greater regulation, according to a national poll released today by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press.
 Thirty-three percent said the biggest lesson to be drawn from the collapse of Enron was "that retirement accounts are not as safe as many think they are," and 25 percent said that was the second-biggest lesson. Among other responses on the lessons of Enron, 20 percent said corporate executives were too focused on profits, 19 percent said corporations had too much influence in Washington and 17 percent said business was not regulated enough. 
The people who were most worried about retirement accounts were those on the verge of using them, respondents between ages 50 and 64. Forty-two percent of that group said the Enron case worried them, compared with 26 percent of those 65 and older.
But some general views of business held steady with past measures. Fifty percent said government regulation of business was necessary, while 41 percent said regulation did more harm than good -- a percentage statistically indistinguishable from the 48 percent who said regulation was necessary and the 41 percent who said it was harmful in an August 1999 survey. Both polls had margins of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
And while 77 percent said a few large corporations "hold too much power," the same share said so in 1999. But there was a small decline, to 40 percent from 45 percent in 1999, among those who said business struck a proper balance between profits and the public interest.
The Feb. 12-18 survey of 1,199 adults found 28 percent saying they were following the Enron story very closely, while another 28 percent said they were following it fairly closely. In a mid-January survey by the Pew Research Center, 19 percent said "very closely" and 23 percent said "fairly closely." 
Those percentages are unusually high for a business story. In the last decade it was topped only by the 35 percent who said they followed a story of General Motors layoffs in January 1992. The 28 percent figure was matched by those who said they followed very closely the June 2000 federal court decision ordering the breakup of the Microsoft Corporation.

HEADLINE: IMPASSE IN ISREAL: REACTIONS; 
United Nations Leader Urges International Action on Mideast

BYLINE:  By SERGE SCHMEMANN

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 21 

 BODY:
Warning that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was "sliding toward a full-fledged war," Secretary General Kofi Annan said today that it had become essential for an active international effort and "new thinking" to get the sides talking again.
 The notion of any outside involvement in the conflict, other than American mediation, has been strongly resisted by Israel and the United States, as it was by their representatives today after Mr. Annan spoke. 
 But in an address to a special session of the Security Council, Mr. Annan sounded an unusually urgent alarm about the disintegration of the situation in the Middle East, declaring, "Truly, we are nearing the edge of the abyss." 
He said that existing American proposals -- known as the Mitchell and Tenet plans -- to bring the Israelis and Palestinians back to negotiating table "can certainly not be said to have succeeded."
"I truly believe that it is imperative for the Security Council and the wider international community to work in a concerted manner with the parties," Mr. Annan said. 
More pointedly, he said that the Israeli insistence on an end to Palestinian violence as a precondition for negotiations -- a position supported by Washington and one that Mr. Sharon repeated in an address today -- was no longer viable. 
"A reduction in the violence is the most immediate priority," Mr. Annan said. "But I have become more and more convinced that trying to resolve the security problem on its own cannot work." 
Mr. Annan spoke shortly after Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon delivered his address in Jerusalem, in which he also announced plans for a buffer zone between Israeli and Palestinian territories and demanded a full disarmament of the Palestinians. 
The secretary general argued that security had to have a context. "It has to be addressed alongside key political issues," he said, "particularly the question of land, and the economic and social issues, including the increasingly critical desperate conditions of the Palestinians."
The "key problems," Mr. Annan said, again diverging widely from the Israelis, were the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory, security, "the need to end violence, including terrorism," and economic deprivation and suffering. "These are inter-linked problems, encompassing the political, security and economic domains," he said.
Mr. Annan's speech represented a relatively aggressive foray into Middle Eastern diplomacy for the secretary general, and it combined a number of themes he has been pressing in recent weeks. 
The Security Council meeting is scheduled to continue next week, when the Arab states are expected to propose a resolution, using Mr. Annan's speech as support, for a call for the council to send a mission to the region and also for some monitoring mechanism for any agreement on continuing negotiations.
There was little doubt that the United States would resist any such resolution, as it usually has in the past. John Negroponte, the American representative, said he would withhold comment until he saw the proposals. But he made clear a resistance to international involvement, noting that the United States was of the view that it was preferable for the two parties to settle their differences. 
But European representatives indicated they thought the council should take a position, even over American resistance. "Violence is being used as part of a deliberate policy on both sides, and it is pointless," said the British representative, Sir Jeremy Greenstock. "I hope the council will collectively be saying that." 
In the corridor outside the Security Council chamber, the Israeli representative to the Security Council, Aaron Jacob, spoke dismissively of the idea of outside intervention. "One side has resorted to violence and terror, others come and say, 'Let's invite a third party,' " he said.
The Palestinian representative, Marwan Jilani, said that was a position "shared only by Israel and one other member of the international community," meaning the United States.

HEADLINE: Not Wanted: '02 Graduates Seeking Jobs 

BYLINE:  By LYNNLEY BROWNING

DATELINE: BOSTON 

 BODY:
When the millions of students who are set to graduate from college this spring started out in the late 1990's, the stock market was on a bull run and the dot-com frenzy was in full swing. At colleges across the country, career-services offices fashioned makeshift interview booths to accommodate the companies on a hiring binge.
 Fresh-faced 22-year-olds commanded signing bonuses of $10,000 or more. People with bachelor's degrees in engineering or computer science often had a dozen job offers, some with six-figure salaries. Liberal arts majors found plenty of opportunities, too, working for Internet companies and consulting and financial firms. 
 Those heady times are gone. With the economy still struggling, layoffs increasing and corporate America wary about the near future, students who complete their undergraduate degrees this year face the worst job market for college graduates in nearly a decade. 
"It's not like people even want a job in their major -- they just want a job," said Sakara A. Bey, a senior at Tufts University who is majoring in engineering psychology. "It's become a prize possession."
Amid a severe retrenchment in hiring that began last summer, said Marilyn F. Mackes, executive director of the National Association of Colleges and Employers, "the job candidate is no longer calling the shots." The association calls this year's job market the tightest for graduating seniors since 1994, when companies began hiring again -- slowly -- after the 1990-91 recession.
Ms. Mackes estimated that there would be 20 to 25 percent fewer jobs for students who graduate with bachelor's degrees this year, typically in May or June. That does not surprise Nathan I. Perlis, 21, a biology and Judaic studies major at Tufts, who has long planned to go to medical school. "Out of 20 friends, I have one who actually has a job," he said in December, about two months after the peak recruiting season at most colleges. "A lot aren't even looking because they know it's so hard."
At Boston University, barely 50 companies came to a two-day recruiting fair in October, compared with about 100 the previous year, said Richard A. Leger, director of career services at the university. Many companies had just instituted hiring freezes, he said, and even those that showed up were, in many cases, there simply to maintain a presence on the campus. Among the no-shows at a B.U. off-campus job fair last month in New York, he said, were Ogilvy & Mather, the advertising agency, and Zenith Media, a communications company that is part of the Zenith Optimedia Group.
Recruiters may not return soon. In January, the unemployment rate was 5.6 percent, the highest level since April 1995. The unemployment rate for college graduates who are 25 or older nudged down to 2.9 percent last month from 3.1 percent in December -- the highest level since April 1993, according to the Bureau for Labor Statistics. Economists expect jobless figures to continue to rise, although at a slower pace. Layoffs have been pronounced in the financial services, consulting, manufacturing and technology industries. Particularly hard hit has been the travel industry.
"You send companies e-mail messages and they say 'We're on hold,' or you never hear back," Mr. Leger said. "It's like we're the ones having to do the recruiting."
Michael J. Walsh Jr., B.U.'s director of career services for engineering students, said 34 companies pledged to come to a job fair for engineering majors earlier this month, compared with 59 companies last year. Seven of the companies agreed to come after Mr. Walsh waived the $250 participation fee for them.
Worse, only 12 companies, mostly military contractors, have signed up to recruit B.U. engineering students this spring, compared with 20 last year. While Mr. Walsh would not name companies that had dropped out, he said they included major computer and software concerns and struggling or defunct dot-coms.
The drought has spurred him to cold-call prospective employers and scan local help-wanted ads for leads.
But such efforts may not bear fruit for another six months. Philip D. Gardner, director of the Collegiate Employment Research Institute at Michigan State University, said that most of the 290 companies surveyed by the institute in October were likely to resume hiring in the summer when students are not on campus and are hard to track down.
FleetBoston Financial, the large bank based in Boston, said it planned to hire only about half as many new graduates this year, mostly as financial analysts and loan officers, according to James E. Mahoney, a spokesman. He noted, though, that last year was a record hiring year for the company. EMC, a data storage company based in Hopkinton, Mass., about 35 miles west of Boston, plans to reduce its hiring of fresh graduates this year by half, to several hundred people, said Greg Eden, a spokesman.
Not all companies are closing their doors. Gillette, which has headquarters in Boston and makes a range of personal goods besides razors, will hire 13 new graduates to start in late spring, one fewer than last year, said Stephen K. Brayton, a spokesman.
The sudden shift in the job market has led students to plan for futures they never envisioned. That may not necessarily be bad, though.
"I'm looking at Teach for America and FEMA," said Adam D. Babin, 21, an advertising major at B.U., referring to a high-school teaching program and the government's emergency-management agency. "Everyone's either going to do something unrelated to their major or move back home."
Around a dozen undergraduates interviewed at Tufts and Boston University late in December said the dwindling number of jobs was also prompting many of them to apply to graduate school in their disciplines or to law school. The Law School Admission Council, an industry organization in Newtown, Pa., said that as of Jan. 26, applications to law school from people of all ages were up 25.2 percent over last year.
But more schooling is not an attractive option to Pavan Pant, 21, an engineering and computer systems major at B.U. "A lot of kids simply don't want to go to grad school after four years in college," Mr. Pant said. He is hoping that his internship last summer at I.B.M. will lead to a job at the company but he does not yet have an offer.
Compounding their troubles, many seniors will have sizable student loans to pay off after graduation. David S. Stein, a clinical psychology major at Tufts with $20,000 in student loans, said he hoped to land an $18,000-a-year job at a home for troubled children and families in Needham, Mass. But if he gets that job, he said, he will have to live with his parents, ask them for money and take out more loans.
Other students said they were scrambling for part-time internships that might become full-time paying jobs. Jean M. Papalia, director of career services at Tufts, said approximately 100 students participated over winter break in one- to two-week internships arranged by the university at local companies and organizations, up from 70 the previous year. The number of companies recruiting at Tufts last fall was much lower, she said, though she could not provide details.
Mr. Gardner of the Collegiate Employment Research Institute said that many engineering and computer science majors would probably receive at least one offer. But starting salaries will not be as stratospheric as in years past. The average high-end salary for computer science majors has fallen from around $65,000 to the low $50,000's, Mr. Gardner said. 
Liberal arts majors are finding the job market particularly tough. 
Amanda K. Bronesky, 21, a senior majoring in international relations and Spanish at Tufts, said she was crushed when EF Education, a language school company based in Cambridge, Mass., dropped out of a Tufts career fair in October. But Ms. Bronesky said she hoped to land an internship, paid or unpaid, at Explorica, an educational exchange company in Boston. Her backup plan is to live with her parents in Denver, and work as a waitress.
"Before the economy got bad, jobs were just given to students," said Ms. Bey, the Tufts senior, whose plan is to apply to graduate programs in engineering psychology. "Now the companies are saying, 'Come and find me.' "

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: ON PATROL; 
International Troops Help Bring Order to Kabul's Streets

BYLINE:  By JOHN F. BURNS

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan, Feb. 19 

 BODY:
For the past six weeks, Maj. David Buckingham of Manns Choice in southwestern Pennsylvania has been wearing the dark red beret of a British paratrooper, living by kerosene lamp in a wrecked Kabul high school and trying, as best he and the British troops can, to bring security to a quarter of a million people in a war-shattered district in the western part of this capital.
 Not many months ago, Major Buckingham was serving in the United States with the 101st Airborne Division. But now he spends his days in Kabul on an exchange with the Parachute Regiment, one of the British Army's most decorated combat units, as part of the force supporting the new post-Taliban government. 
 For Major Buckingham, the assignment must seem a paradox. While he oversees patrols in the shattered streets of Kabul and works alongside the local police to curb the lawlessness that surged in the wake of the Taliban's collapse, his old unit, the 101st Airborne, is doing what soldiers like to do most -- soldiering against the enemy.
After all, the 101st Airborne boasts a rich history in World War II, when it was a battlefield partner with the Parachute Regiment in the drive to Berlin. Known as the Screaming Eagles, the American division has been operating out of Kandahar airport, the main American base in Afghanistan, conducting helicopter missions against Taliban and Al Qaeda targets alongside American Special Forces teams.
While his American colleagues may have the more glorified combat role, Major Buckingham, a 36-year-old engineering graduate of Penn State University, considers himself lucky because the exchange with the Parachute Regiment is a choice midcareer assignment. 
Instead of working a desk job in Washington, which would have followed his stint with the 101st Airborne, he is part of the 4,500-troop International Stabilization Assistance Force, or ISAF, representing 15 nations and operating under a United Nations mandate.
"I'd have been somewhere in the basement of the Pentagon -- doing important stuff for sure, but not as much fun as being in the field like this, as any infantryman will tell you," he said as another 20-degree night settled over the paratroopers' bare-brick, unlighted and mostly unheated bivouac at a high school in the Karte Seh district of Kabul.
What the force has been doing has consisted partly of showing the flag, sending troops on patrol on foot and in jeeps. The idea is to be seen by Kabul's one million residents and -- the soldiers hope -- to enlist help against the armed gangs who have exploited a power vacuum that followed the flight of the Taliban.
In this, just about everybody here agrees, the soldiers have made an important impact, sharply reducing crimes like murder, house-breaking and car hijacking in just weeks.
The force has also begun to help rebuilding roads, schools and clinics, restoring power lines and getting the garbage trucks back in service. Perhaps most important, the soldiers have reopened Kabul airport, assigning teams to remove unexploded bombs, shells and mines; blow up the wrecks of fighter planes left by Soviet occupation forces; and fill craters on the runways and taxiways. 
Only three months after it was silenced by American bombing, the airport has heavy transport aircraft landing around the clock, including, for the first time this week, a Boeing 747 jumbo jet, chartered by the American charity CARE.
The difference is mirrored everywhere in the city. "The improving security situation has underpinned an improving commercial confidence," the commander of the international force, Maj. Gen. John McColl of Britain, said at a recent news conference.
"The first day I came to Kabul in mid-December, the streets were quiet, there were few cars and the level of economic activity seemed low," General McColl said. "Six weeks later, Kabul is teeming. The markets are full of goods, the streets are full of people and there seem to be more cars on the road every day." 
The change is not confined to Kabul; in itself, the end of the Taliban's repressive rule allowed much in the normal life of the country to resume. But Kabul is the only city to have the steadying influence of the international force, and thus has improved to an extent unmatched elsewhere, a situation that is increasingly cited in the debate about the next step.
The United States has resisted any expansion of the force beyond Kabul, saying Afghanistan's future security lies in building a new national army, which Washington has pledged to help finance and train. The American view reflects a determination not to be drawn too deeply into Afghanistan's internal affairs, and thus risk making a much larger force -- which many Afghans favor -- hostage to a new political breakdown or, worse, to another civil war.
The operations of the stabilization force are completely separate from those of the 4,000 American troops currently based in Afghanistan as part of the hunt for remnants of the Taliban and Al Qaeda.
But senior officials from other nations who deal closely with Afghanistan say expanding the multinational force may be the only way to check the power of the feuding warlords, who control most of the country, and to give the fledgling government a chance to extend its authority.
The case has been made most insistently by Hamid Karzai, chairman of the interim administration, who has continued to press for a wider mandate for the security force despite the rebuff he received two weeks ago when he made the argument in Washington and London.
Patroling the streets with Major Buckingham's troops, the force's popularity seemed clear. As dusk settled, a dozen British soldiers fanned out to either side of the street as they made an hourlong tour through a blasted landscape of crumbling buildings, where whole neighborhoods have been virtually obliterated by artillery battles between the rival Afghan forces who fought for Kabul in the years before the Taliban took the city in 1996. Pedestrians and bicyclists hurrying home before the pitch-darkness of a night without electricity paused to greet the soldiers.
Muhammad Anif, a 30-year-old pharmacist, waved breezily in response to a greeting of "Salaam!" from Sgt. Martin Seville, section leader in charge of the patrol.
"We feel so happy when we see the ISAF soldiers," Mr. Anif said, "because we feel that we are free."
Nearby, a group of young men who grew up in Pakistan after their families fled the Soviet invasion of 1979 agreed.
"We hope they stay for a long, long time and expand to every part of the country," said Naib Khan, a 19-year-old who returned to Kabul last month to apply for entry to Kabul University. "Please tell America, Afghanistan loves the ISAF!"

HEADLINE: Harvard to Require Top Score To Earn Advanced Placement 

BYLINE:  By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
In the latest blow to the increasingly popular program of advanced placement courses, Harvard University will no longer award college credit to freshmen who score lower than five -- the top score -- on examinations in the subjects.
 Most colleges give credit for a score of three, four, or five on the advanced placement tests, administered by the College Board, but many of the most selective schools are discussing limits on credits for the scores. 
 In recent years, many high school students have used the examinations to impress admissions officers, avoid introductory courses and even enter college as sophomores.
Last year 820,880 high school students took 1.38 million advanced placement exams -- more than twice as many students as took them a decade ago. Last year, 13 percent of the students earned fives, 20 percentfours, and 27 percent threes. 
Harvard's decision, first reported yesterday in The Boston Globe, was based in part on a finding that in second-year chemistry and economics, students with scores of four, and no previous Harvard courses, did far worse than those who scored five, and worse than the class as a whole.
Harvard is apparently the first school to require scores of five for advanced standing, or sophomore status. Starting with the class of 2007, only those with at least four fives will be eligible.
But some other elite schools, including the California Institute of Technology, give no advanced placement credit, and at others some departments give no credit or credit only for a score of five.
Last week, a study by the National Research Council criticized advanced placement math and science classes as cramming in too much material at the expense of understanding and as failing to keep up with developments in the subjects.
While the trend nationwide is for public high schools to offer more advanced placement classes, some selective private schools are moving the other way. In New York, the Fieldston School, which recently dropped the courses, found that this year's seniors, the first with no advanced placement classes on their transcripts, did just as well in college admissions as previous classes.
The proliferation of the credits presents colleges with a practical problem and an intellectual one. 
As a practical matter, at most selective schools, a significant part of the class may be eligible to place out of the freshman year. "Now that the Ivy League schools get so many students with six, seven or eight AP's," said Lee Jones, the College Board vice president responsible for the program, "there's a real issue about how many credits they're going to give to how many students." 
As an academic issue, some schools are concerned that many students with good advanced placement scores may nonetheless be unprepared for high-level college work.
Ronald M. Latanision, a material science professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said: "About two years ago, we decided we would no longer give AP credit in chemistry, because the previous year, a third of the freshman class placed out of chemistry, but when they went into upper-level courses, they were clearly not prepared. We don't discourage kids from taking AP courses, but we're not going to give credit."
Other departments are concerned, but there is no across-the-board view yet, Dr. Latanision said. "There's definitely concern about biology and writing, and it wouldn't surprise me if down the line we made an institutionwide decision not to give credit."
Boston University is reviewing its policies after finding that in 2000 the number of entering students with advanced placement credits had doubled from the number in 1995.
Mr. Jones, of the College Board, said he was convinced that those who scored well on the tests were ready for advanced courses.
"Our data shows that students with a three or above do just fine in the next-level courses, and that, at most institutions, those with four virtually always outperform students who took the introductory course at the college," he said.
But the professors who teach them are not so sure. 
"Students who do well on the AP exams have learned to answer the kind of questions that appear on the AP exams," said Daniel L. Goroff, a Harvard math professor, "but they may or may not be prepared to think on their own and grapple with conceptual questions at a college level.
"There was work done here some years ago on the cognitive development of students in the college years, finding that they come to college thinking there is a right answer that the authorities have to tell them, and that they have to memorize. We want them to learn to think on their own."

 CORRECTION:
An article on Friday about Harvard University's decision to give college credit for advanced placement courses only when students score a five -- the top score -- on examinations, rather than a three, four or five, misstated the newspaper that first reported on the decision. It was The Harvard Crimson, not The Boston Globe.

HEADLINE: Proposals For Memorials Move Close To Approval 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
Two proposals for temporary memorials to the victims of the World Trade Center attack, one using huge beams of light and the other a damaged bronze sculpture, are moving closer to approval, city and state officials said yesterday. 
 The remains of the spherical bronze sculpture by Fritz Koenig that stood in the World Trade Center plaza would serve as the centerpiece of a temporary memorial being considered by the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, the group overseeing the rebuilding of downtown. The memorial would remain in place for as long as two years, while a permanent memorial was conceived and installed at the site of the fallen towers. 
 City Hall officials also said yesterday that a proposal to erect a temporary memorial project known as the Towers of Light was still under consideration and could be approved as soon as today. The memorial, which would project two huge beams of light into the night sky from a location near the former site of the trade center, is likely to last several weeks to a few months, the officials said. 
The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation has identified four potential sites for its temporary memorial, Alexander Garvin, the group's vice president for planning, design and development, said yesterday at a meeting of the corporation's board.
The sites and the proposal to include the sculpture in a temporary memorial will be presented Thursday to the Families Advisory Council, a group of victims' family members who have been selected to advise the development corporation. 
Louis R. Tomson, the president and executive director of the corporation, said that the plans might change based on the feedback from the advisory panel. 
The sculpture, which was damaged in the collapse of the towers, is stored at Kennedy Airport.
Each of the four sites is near ground zero. One is along Church Street, near the public viewing platform; one is near the intersection of Liberty and West Streets, near the family viewing platform; another is in a lot at West and Murray Streets, in Battery Park City, the site of a temporary shelter for rescue workers and equipment; and the fourth is in a small triangular plot of land at Murray Street and North End Avenue, also in Battery Park City.
The large lot being used by rescue workers, which is cater-corner to the northwestern edge of the disaster site, has also been discussed as a location for the Towers of Light project.
Talk about the temporary memorial has focused on March 11 as a target date to open the project, six months after the terrorist attacks. But Daniel Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development, who has been working with the development corporation, said yesterday, "I don't think it's appropriate to put too much emphasis on March 11."
Also yesterday, the development corporation proposed a $10 million grant program to train or retrain workers at small businesses south of 14th Street, and released the details of its proposed $200 million grant program to retain and attract residents to Lower Manhattan.
Companies affected by the attack will receive priority for the grants, according to an outline of the program.
The corporation gave preliminary approval to the program of grants for housing assistance to residents below Canal Street. Under the proposal, which will go through two public comment periods and which must be approved by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, residents closest to the site would receive 30 percent of their monthly rent or mortgage and maintenance payments, up to $12,000 over two years. 
That benefit would be available for people living anywhere below Chambers Street and west of Broadway, including all of Battery Park City. For others living below Canal or Rutgers Streets the benefit would be the same but limited to $6,000 over two years. 
All of the resident grants require a commitment to stay in Lower Manhattan for at least two years.

 BODY:
Officials Say Recession Has Most Likely Ended
Economists and government officials said that the recession had almost certainly come to an end but that it remained unclear how strong and sustained the recovery would be.
 White House officials said the economy was growing at a modest but accelerating rate and credited the tax cut President Bush signed into law last year for minimizing the depth and duration of the downturn. Page A23. 

Computer Associates Shares Slide
Shares of Computer Associates International skidded for a second day on reports that federal regulators and prosecutors are investigating its accounting practices. The company also tapped a line of credit that comes due in 2003 to repay shorter-term bank lines of credit and prevent a shortage of cash. Shares of Computer Associates dropped $2.01, or 9.6 percent, to $18.90. In the last month, the shares have lost half their value. C2.

Aetna Reports a Loss for Last Year
Aetna lost money last year, the company said, but added that it was "on track" to return to an operating profit in 2002. The company declined to respond to analysts' questions about how soon its turnaround effort would deliver a profit or how much it might be. C8.

Nasdaq Tumbles to Four-Month Low
Stocks fell yesterday, driving the Nasdaq composite index to its lowest level in almost four months. The Nasdaq tumbled 59.33 points, or 3.3 percent, to 1,716.24, its lowest close since Oct. 31. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 106.49 points, or 1.1 percent, to 9,834.68. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 17.03 points, or 1.6 percent, to 1,080.95. C8.

Congress Seeks Data on ImClone
A Congressional committee asked seven pharmaceutical companies to turn over records pertaining to negotiations they had with ImClone Systems about its cancer drug, Erbitux. Separately, ImClone's chief executive, Samuel D. Waksal, returned $486,000 to the company that he gained from stock sales that might have violated a rule on trading by insiders, the company said. C2.

Talks in Terror Insurance Venture
Three of Europe's biggest insurance companies -- Allianz of Germany, Swiss Re and Zurich Financial Services -- are in talks to set up a Luxembourg-based joint venture that would provide partial insurance coverage for terror-attack risks in Europe, perhaps with government backing. C12.

AT&T Moves President Closer to Top
By all appearances, David W. Dorman, left, would have to do something shocking to avoid becoming AT&T's next chief executive. That became clear as AT&T named Mr. Dorman, the company's president, to the board. It has been clear for at least a year that Mr. Dorman was the favorite to become the chief executive once the company sold or spun off its cable television operation. C2.

Big 5 Under Scrutiny Overseas
The credibility of the Big Five accounting firms is coming under attack overseas in the wake of Enron. Europe, meanwhile, is stepping up calls for the United States to recognize international accounting standards. In Australia, Enron's fall is painfully familiar, given the collapse of the HIH Group, the country's No. 2 insurer. World Business, Section W.

Official Says Greenspan Is Staying
Alan Greenspan has no intention of stepping down soon as the Federal Reserve chairman, Lawrence B. Lindsey, the White House's chief economic policy adviser, said. C8.

Inquiry Into Smirnoff Promotion
Advertising, labels and packaging for the popular new Smirnoff Ice malt alcohol beverage are being referred for scrutiny to two federal agencies after a competitor complained that those marketing materials mislead consumers into thinking it contains Smirnoff vodka. C4.

JUDGE CERTIFIES CLASS-ACTION STATUS IN SUIT AGAINST RAND

BYLINE:  By Jonathan D. Glater (NYT)

 BODY:
 A federal judge has certified a 1996 suit brought by women employees at the RAND Corporation, the research group, as a class action. The decision, made earlier this week by Judge Richard W. Roberts of United States District Court in Washington, clears the way for a federal lawsuit. 
The class consists of about 250 women who worked at RAND as long ago as 1994 and as recently as 1998, said Michael D. Lieder, a partner at Sprenger & Lang in Washington, which is representing plaintiffs. The plaintiffs contend that the company discriminated against them, paying them thousands of dollars less than it paid men, he said. A lawyer for RAND played down the significance of the ruling. "We view this simply as a step in the process," said Karen J. Kubin, whose law firm, Cooley Godward, is representing RAND. "If the case does get to trial, we're confident that RAND will prevail."

HEADLINE: As Endowments Slip at Colleges, Big Tuition Increases Fill the Void 

BYLINE:  By YILU ZHAO

DATELINE: FORT WORTH 

 BODY:
With their endowments and contributions continuing to shrink in a sagging economy, the nation's private colleges and universities are raising tuition for the next academic year more sharply than in recent years, sometimes significantly so.
 The sometimes striking tuition increases, just now being reported, come after seven years of moderate tuition increases at generally twice the rate of inflation. Colleges are also scaling back on construction and hiring, after a span of flush years when the institutions added buildings, increased faculty sizes and created academic programs. 
 "Tuition is definitely going to go up at a disproportionately higher rate than we have seen in recent years," said Larry Goldstein, a senior fellow at the National Association of College and University Business Officers. "Tuition rates have been remarkably stable because of the good economy. Now the economic pressure has increased, and they cannot keep tuition growth at this level anymore." 
Texas Christian University, a private campus in the middle of this onetime cattle town, has decided to raise tuition by 8.7 percent, to $16,300, for the next academic year, the biggest increase in the university's 129-year history.
Barnard College, in New York City, reported a tuition increase of 5 percent, to $24,090. Last year's increase was 4 percent. At Cornell University, tuition will be $27,270, a 5 percent increase that is the largest in seven years. 
The tuition at George Washington University will rise by 4.9 percent, the largest increase in four years and one that ends a 13-year trend of declining tuition increases. The tuition increase at Dartmouth College will be 4.5 percent, breaking the institution's longtime policy of keeping increases under 3.5 percent. At Emory University, tuition will increase by 5.4 percent; last year it grew 4 percent. At each of these three institutions, tuition will be around $27,000 a year; room and board can add $8,000.
This fall, Baylor University in Waco, Tex., will charge freshmen $15,700, 33 percent more than it charged current first-year students. The chief financial officer, David Brooks, said the increase was largely a result of the university's ambition to move into a rarefied group of colleges by adding buildings and faculty members. The endowment has also declined.
College endowments lost 3.6 percent on investments in the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2001, the biggest drop since 1984, according to a survey of 610 public and private colleges conducted by the National Association of College and University Business Officers. The trend continued from July to December 2001.
"An economic downturn negatively affects every other university revenue source," said David L. Warren, president of the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities. "It affects corporate and foundation giving, earnings from endowments and fund-raising from alumni and friends. Tuition is the one revenue stream over which independent universities have control."
Most colleges spend part -- often about 5 percent -- of their endowments annually. 
The hefty tuition increases at private campuses come as many state legislatures have cut budgets for public universities, causing double-digit tuition increases.
In the private realm, Texas Christian increased tuition because its endowment dropped by 13 percent from its $1 billion peak in March 2000 and alumni contributions decreased by 15 percent in the last quarter of 2001, compared with the same period in 2000, the chancellor, Michael R. Ferrari, said. In the 1990's, the university raised tuition 4 percent to 5 percent annually. 
"It stinks," Sarah Horton, a sophomore, said of the tuition increase. "My parents and I had set aside a chunk of money for my college education, expecting tuition to increase only a little bit every year. Now I would have to scrape around a little more than I would like to."
Ms. Horton, who had planned to travel in Thailand this summer, said she had now decided to get a "lucrative job" here at home to save for the next academic year.
Larger tuition increases are not the universities' only response to the economic downturn. Cornell has imposed a hiring freeze on nonacademic staff until at least June. Emory has asked its academic deans to eliminate centers and institutes that are not performing well. Duke University has frozen the budget of every administrative unit. Harvard plans to close the Washington office of its Kennedy School of Government. 
While these are natural responses to difficult economic times, they seem particularly jarring to college administrators after years of giddy expansion, when many endowments doubled and even tripled. 
With the increased income pouring in from the stock market, Bowdoin College built a theater, a student union building, a coastal studies center and three dorms. Emory cut its student-faculty ratio to nine to one this year from 20 to one in 1991, the provost, Howard Hunter, said. Princeton University replaced some student loans with scholarships.
The endowment losses have been sizable. Boston University's endowment, once $930 million, declined by $256 million from 2000 to 2001. Emory, which once had an almost $5 billion endowment, now has $4.4 billion. Harvard, the wealthiest of American colleges, saw its endowment drop $900 million to $18.3 billion within a year. 
The decreases reflect the downturn of the domestic stock market, where more than a third of college and university money is invested.
According to a survey of 450 institutions of higher education by Commonfund Institute, a Connecticut organization that manages more than $27 billion for more than 1,500 nonprofit organizations, last year many universities reduced the percentage of endowments that contributed to the operating budget in an effort to protect their nest eggs. The average percentage, or payout rate, shrank to 4.8 percent last year from 5 percent.
At least one college president decided to buck the trend. "We saved the nest eggs for the rainy days, and now it's raining," said Morton Schapiro, the president of Williams College, who has persuaded his board to increase the payout rate of the college's $1.3 billion endowment. "We need to dig into the endowment now precisely because that's what we've saved the money for."
Alumni and corporate contributions to colleges have also declined. Stanford University, often the front-runner in attracting donations, received $120 million less, or 26 percent, in the 2001 fiscal year compared with 2000.
The sudden change is palpable at Texas Christian, where construction is under way for a student recreation center with a rock-climbing wall, indoor and outdoor pools, and a fully wired technology center. The next project, a new student dining hall, has been postponed indefinitely. 
Some students here argue that their university's fiscal caution is unwarranted. Although Texas Christian's endowment has slipped to $870 million from its $1 billion peak, it was $700 million just four years ago. Why not spend some of the nest egg accumulated during prosperity, the students ask. But university administrators disagree.
"If you spend too much of your endowment, you are eating your seed corn," said Carol Campbell, the vice chancellor of finance at Texas Christian. "Next year, you won't have anything to plant."

HEADLINE: Looking Askance at U.S. Auditors 

BYLINE:  By SUZANNE KAPNER

DATELINE: LONDON, Feb. 21 

 BODY:
For years they have offered the auditing world's answer to the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval: With the stroke of a pen, a Big Five accounting firm can lend instant credibility to the books of a company.
 And credibility means money. Without a Big Five audit, it is more difficult for companies in Western Europe -- and all but impossible for those in the East -- to raise capital from foreign investors. 
 But the credibility of the Big Five is coming under attack. Alarmed by the failure of the Enron Corporation, regulators from Milan to Moscow are giving the work of American auditors new scrutiny, and finding some of it wanting. Fuming investors are accusing auditors, who are supposed to be promoting good corporate governance and transparency, of instead turning a blind eye to mismanagement and corruption. 
Two of the most prominent cases center on accusations that auditors helped paint a veneer of legitimacy on dubious transactions that stripped away billions of dollars in assets from companies -- a practice grown so common in some countries that it has acquired a slang name, tunneling.
In Moscow, a Russian financial oversight panel said this week that it would examine the audits by PricewaterhouseCoopers of Gazprom, the giant natural gas monopoly that minority shareholders contend has been tunneled. Regulators are still investigating the June 2000 collapse of Investicni a Postovni Banka, a large Czech bank, where the role of Ernst & Young as auditor is the subject of an inquiry by Czech regulators.
Ernst & Young said it had cooperated fully with investigators and that "no wrongdoing could be found on our part." The firm noted that a Czech parliamentary committee investigating the matter found that the bank had misled its auditors.
Citing a policy of not discussing pending investigations, PricewaterhouseCoopers declined to comment on the Gazprom matter.
Speaking generally, accounting executives defended the track records of the Big Five (the other three are Deloitte & Touche, KPMG and Arthur Andersen). In many countries where they operate, the executives said, the legal and regulatory framework underpinning responsible financial reporting is either nonexistent or has been put in place only recently.
Local laws often oblige foreign accounting firms to work through a locally owned affiliate rather than allowing them directly to control the office that bears their name, the executives said. And accounting rules in many countries embody standards of transparency and disclosure that are still crude in American terms.
"We can't always paint the picture as we see it," said Richard H. Murray, global head of legal and regulatory affairs for Deloitte & Touche. Often, he said, auditors face a "kind of Hobson's choice" between tolerating clients who do business the opaque local way and having no clients at all. 
Some of the people who rely on audits to make lending decisions do not see it that way. At a recent meeting in London, executives from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development fretted that auditors are not doing enough to ensure that company reports paint a true picture. "Ultimately, auditors should be held accountable," said Noreen Doyle, the group's head of banking.
Lured by the prospect of new markets for their services after the fall of the Soviet Union, most of the Big Five firms opened offices in Moscow, Prague and Warsaw in the mid-1990's, and rushed to train a cadre of accountants in the ways of the West.
But the stampede of client companies seeking Big Five audits overwhelmed the limited supply of trained auditors, and the quality of the work suffered, analysts said. Making matters worse in some countries was the absence of any homegrown competition. In Prague, "without an audit from the Big Five, you have no audit," said Michal Rizek, an analyst with CAIB International Markets.
One result has been relationships between clients and auditors that are "too cozy," said John Rieger, head of corporate affairs for the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
Minority shareholders in Gazprom are trying to shake up the coziness with a vote to dismiss PricewaterhouseCoopers as the company's auditor at the annual meeting in June. They say audits have failed to depict the true state of the company's finances. For example, only after a public outcry last year did PricewaterhouseCoopers disclose information about related-party deals at Gazprom, including the granting of billions of dollars in construction contracts to a company called Stroitransgas, which is owned in part by relatives of Gazprom management.
Gazprom, which controls the world's largest reserves of natural gas, was itself shaken up last year by President Vladimir V. Putin, who installed new management and said that "enormous sums" had been siphoned out of the company.
"Pricewaterhouse did a horrible disservice to shareholders and the government by whitewashing the whole thing," said William F. Browder, whose Russian investment fund, Hermitage Capital Management, has been an investor in Gazprom since 1996. "We want to make an example of them so that no auditor ever feels comfortable doing this again."
When an auditor does sound the alarm, a company's management can often find a rival willing to keep mum. When a 1996 audit by Coopers & Lybrand, now part of PricewaterhouseCoopers, disclosed serious shortcomings in the provisions for bad loans made by Investicni a Postovni Banka, the bank dismissed Coopers and brought in Ernst & Young to perform a new audit, which found the bad-loan provisions to be more than adequate.
Even so, rumors of insufficient reserves persisted, prompting a run on the bank in the spring of 2000 that ultimately forced it into administration. Regulators, forensic accountants and investigators are still trying to find $9.5 billion of assets that were listed on the books of the bank that Ernst & Young certified. 
Ernst & Young's German office has since taken over operations at the Czech office, which had been owned by three local partners.
In Western Europe, regulators are bolstering enforcement activities. Investigators in Britain are examining the role of Arthur Andersen in accounting irregularities discovered last year at SSL International, the maker of Scholl sandals and Durex condoms. Arthur Andersen has said there is no evidence that any of its audits were deficient.
Italian regulators recently ordered PricewaterhouseCoopers to suspend one partner over irregularities in the accounts of a regional banking group, Banca Popolare di Novara. The firm said it would lodge an appeal against the order.
Spanish authorities have fined Deloitte & Touche in connection with the collapse last summer of Gescartera, a Madrid brokerage firm whose inability to account for some 100 million euros in customer funds has led to charges of embezzlement against its owners. A Deloitte spokeswoman said it was contesting the fine.
Most analysts and industry executives say that problem cases are the rare exception and that most Big Five auditors in Europe and elsewhere do their work with an admirable, if unsung, thoroughness and professionalism befitting their reputation. 
So it is all the more alarming, Mr. Browder of Hermitage Capital said, when an auditor does turn out to have dropped the ball -- or worse, to have been a participant with crooked managers -- because "these guys are supposed to be part of the solution, not part of the problem."

HEADLINE: ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: CONSULTING; 
Keen Rivalry By Consultants Expected After Auditors' Shift

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN D. GLATER

 BODY:
The shift away from consulting by big accounting firms is likely to lead to new and intense competition over clients as independent firms aggressively pursue companies that have bought consulting services from their auditors in the past.
 Those firms could be joined by consulting businesses that are being spun off from two of the Big Five. But the soon-to-be-independent firms face a very poor market, analysts say, in part because accountants' consulting units have been indirectly tainted by the collapse of Enron, whose auditor, Arthur Andersen, also sold the company consulting services. In addition, the consulting industry has been in a slump for more than a year because of the recession, making the businesses even more unattractive. 
 "The economy's terrible, and nobody's buying these services," said Tom Rodenhauser, president of Consulting Information Services in Keene, N.H. "No one may buy them, and their services may be drastically cut. It's quite possible that they could wither to the point of inconsequence. That's the most dire prediction one could make."
Even with the changes that the Big Five accounting firms have said they will make, concerns about conflicts of interest for accountants are likely to persist because there are some kinds of services that they will continue to sell, like tax advice. That means there is still the possibility that an auditor's judgment will be swayed by the prospect of nonaudit-related fees.
PricewaterhouseCoopers has said it intends to spin off its consulting unit through a public stock offering, and Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu recently announced plans to separate from Deloitte Consulting, though it has not specified how. Ernst & Young and KPMG have already separated from their consulting arms. Only Arthur Andersen, which was formally divorced from Andersen Consulting, now known as Accenture, last year but which has built its own consulting business over the last few years, has stated that it intends to hold on to consulting.
All of the Big Five firms, however, have said that they will curtail the consulting services they sell to companies they audit. The shift creates an opening for big technology consulting companies that are not affiliated with accounting firms, like Electronic Data Systems, I.B.M. Global Services and Accenture. 
"It's a great opportunity for both I.B.M. and E.D.S. to take market share," said John McCain, president of the E Solutions consulting unit of E.D.S. In the past, he said, it has been difficult for consulting firms to compete against accountants who audit a potential client. "They've got some great relationships that they've built up over decades that are very hard to unseat," he said
Because accountants are being forced to limit their consulting work, he said, E.D.S. is aggressively courting companies that until now have bought consulting from their accounting firms. "Their clients are worried," he said, referring to the accountants. "The problem is real, and it's reasonably substantial."
KPMG Consulting, formerly a unit of KPMG, is also aggressively pursuing clients that bought consulting services from auditors, said Rand Blazer, the firm's chief executive. "We have a proactive campaign that's under way," he said, adding that he was glad KPMG Consulting separated from its parent -- the firm went public last year -- when it did. "The whole process of becoming public is not as easy as one-two-three," he said. "We're glad to have this behind us."
Now is also not a great time for a consulting firm to go public because worried clients, coupled with the slow economy, do not make them particularly attractive to either investors or potential acquirers, Mr. Rodenhauser, the analyst, said.
PricewaterhouseCoopers tried to sell its consulting unit nearly two years ago, but the deal fell apart when the prospective buyer, Hewlett-Packard, balked at the price. PricewaterhouseCoopers had wanted close to $18 billion for the business, according to reports at the time. Now the firm says it is planning a public stock offering instead.
Executives at Deloitte Consulting, who had long emphasized that they wanted to remain a part of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, say they are not sure what direction the firm will take.
"We're looking at our options," said Douglas M. McCracken, chief executive of Deloitte Consulting, adding that several possibilities were being considered, including a stock offering, a sale, taking the firm private or a merger. "By the end of May, we'll have a decision."
Andersen has consistently insisted that it has no plans to separate from its consulting business, although executives in the industry have said that the firm has raised the possibility with some technology companies. Large technology companies like Hitachi, Compaq Computer and Fujitsu have made no secret of their interest in building consulting operations that can compete against I.B.M. Global Services.
Over the last year, the path to a public offering has already been blazed by Accenture and KPMG. While both companies have done reasonably well, Accenture has pleased Wall Street more even in a down market, said Jack Sweeney, an editor at Kennedy Information, which tracks the consulting industry. 
"Accenture, I think two times for the first two quarters, came in above expectations, and KPMG hasn't done that," he said, referring to Accenture's earnings reports. "Those who follow, they want to borrow a page from Accenture."
Even after the sale of the consulting businesses, accounting firms will still do more than audit companies, accountants say. For example, some accounting firms have provided tax advice for at least as long as they have provided audit services, said Dennis Nally, managing partner of PricewaterhouseCoopers's business in the United States. 
"We think the provision of tax services in no way impairs our independence or objectivity," Mr. Nally said. "In many cases it's also crucial to have that kind of capability within our organization to do an effective audit," because understanding corporate transactions often requires an understanding of their tax implications, he said.

HEADLINE: ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: THE OVERVIEW; 
Connecticut Feels Fallout From Enron

BYLINE:  By PAUL ZIELBAUER with MICHAEL BRICK

 BODY:
Trying to make up for $220 million lost in a murky deal with the Enron Corporation, the Connecticut state trash authority voted yesterday to raise its rates, effectively increasing household garbage fees in 70 towns -- representing more than a third of the state -- by nearly $50 a year.
 Though the State Legislature may challenge the fees, they represent perhaps the most concrete example of how Enron's collapse has jolted the finances of people who never worked for, held shares in, or knew the first thing about the company. The deal with Enron, meanwhile, has set off an election-year political fight in Connecticut. 
 At a meeting in Hartford, the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority, a quasi-independent public agency, voted to increase its trash-dumping fees by 31 percent and to impose a $20 fee for collecting recyclable waste. 
Last March, the authority paid Enron $220 million, ostensibly to take over a contract from a local utility to buy the authority's trash-generated steam electricity. In exchange, Enron -- though it never actually transported or sold the electricity -- agreed to pay the authority nearly $2.4 million a month, through the contract's expiration in 2012. 
With Enron's collapse, the authority became one more unsecured creditor, and officials acknowledged earlier this month that they would probably never recover the $220 million they advanced to Enron.
The deal has been criticized by the state attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, and by Democratic candidates for governor. The Democrats have been eager to blame the $220 million loss on Gov. John G. Rowland, a Republican whose co-chief of staff, Peter Ellef, is the chairman of the trash authority.
In a preliminary report released Wednesday, Mr. Blumenthal denounced the deal as an unsecured loan "disguised and camouflaged" as an energy transaction. He said the authority, which state law prohibits from making loans, hoped to reap a 7 percent profit over the contract's 11-year span. The terms of the contract would have obligated Enron to pay the agency $21.3 million from April 2001, when it took effect, to December, when the company filed for bankruptcy protection.
As for Enron, Mr. Blumenthal said in an interview yesterday that its "motive was to have a quick $220 million, which it certainly did not book as a liability." He added that the deal "fits the pattern" of many other transactions that Enron made in the months before it collapsed, borrowing money in deals that made little long-term financial sense. 
Enron, he said, was required to make its monthly payment to the state agency regardless of whether it produced any electricity. Under the deal, Enron gained title to the authority's energy only for an instant before it was transferred back to the agency, Mr. Blumenthal said. 
In essence, his report concluded, Enron did nothing in return for the money it received from the Connecticut agency except promise to pay it back, with interest. "This $220 million was an infusion of cash when Enron needed it," he said. 
An Enron spokesman declined to comment on the matter, saying he was unfamiliar with the transaction.
Mr. Ellef, the trash authority chairman, defended the deal as a good arrangement for the state that simply got caught up in a financial debacle that humbled dozens of other institutions, as well. "We were the victim, like everyone else was," Mr. Ellef told reporters yesterday. 
Mr. Blumenthal's report criticized the trash authority for employing as its lawyers on the the deal the same law firm that worked as Enron's chief lobbyist in Connecticut. 
The Hartford-based firm, Murtha, Cullina, Richter & Pinney, said earlier this month that it had disclosed its dual role to both sides in writing. A spokesman for the firm declined to comment on the matter yesterday.
Robert E. Wright, the president of the trash authority, whose board members are appointed by the governor and legislature, said last week that the deal with Enron evolved from meetings in 2000 about a fuel cell venture.
As the talks proceeded, he said, Enron became increasingly interested in taking over the authority's contract with the Connecticut Light and Power Company, a local utility, to buy power that the authority generated from a Hartford-area trash-to-electricity operation. 
Exactly why Enron wanted to assume the contract under terms that obligated it to pay money back with interest is unclear. 
Mr. Blumenthal said yesterday that, according to documents and other evidence his office has examined, Enron appeared to have discovered during the fuel cell talks that Connecticut Light and Power planned to pay the authority $280 million to back out of its contract.
"Enron found that C.R.R.A. was on the verge of receiving this very large amount of money," he said. "The discussions went from there."
Separately, the judge presiding over Enron's bankruptcy case turned back a request from creditors to put a trustee in control of the company's finances. But the judge, Arthur J. Gonzalez of the Federal Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan, ordered the appointment of an examiner to monitor the finances of Enron's main operating unit, Enron North America. Judge Gonzalez ordered the examiner to prepare a report on transfers of money from the unit, which includes Enron's pipelines and formerly included its trading operation, to the parent company.
Creditors had asserted that Enron could be moving funds generated from energy trading contracts to other units, including some that are not in bankruptcy. They argued that Enron North America could have generated billions of dollars while extracting itself from contracts as it prepared to transfer Enron's trading unit to UBS Warburg last month.
Enron responded in court filings that it was not draining away money and pledged that its bankrupt units would work with the creditors to ensure that money borrowed by other parts of the company was repaid.
An Enron spokesman, Vance Meyer, said that the company had no objection to the judge's action. "At the end of the day, our goal is to emerge from bankruptcy," he said. "To do that, the creditors have to be comfortable with the operation. We hope today's decision gives them an added sense of confidence so we can continue moving forward together."
Judge Gonzalez had given a group of Enron's creditors -- participants in the company's 401(k) plan -- a small victory on Wednesday. He partly lifted a stay on lawsuits by the plan participants, allowing them to begin demanding information from Enron as they pursue litigation in a federal court in Houston.

HEADLINE: Initial Jobless Claims Increase 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 21 

 BODY:
The number of Americans who filed initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 10,000 last week, the Labor Department reported today.
 The number remained below 400,000 for the seventh consecutive week, the longest such stretch since the recession began almost a year ago, providing a sign of recovery. 
 A separate report from the Commerce Department showed that the United States trade deficit in goods and services unexpectedly narrowed to $25.3 billion in December from $28.6 billion in November as oil prices fell.
For all of 2001, the trade deficit narrowed to $346.3 billion from a record gap of $375.7 billion in 2000.
Two other reports released today offered signs that the economy might be rebounding. The index of leading economic indicators rose in January for a fourth consecutive month and manufacturing in the Philadelphia area improved.
"It's increasingly clear that we have turned the corner," said Bill Cheney, the chief economist at John Hancock Financial Services in Boston. The leading indicator index, a gauge of the economy's performance over the next three to six months, rose 0.6 percent last month after a 1.3 percent increase in December, according to the Conference Board, a business research group. The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's factory index rose to 16 in February, the second month of growth after 13 months of decline.
The narrowing of the trade deficit may prompt the government to revise upward its 0.2 percent estimate of fourth-quarter growth. "A 1 percent rate now looks possible," said Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y.

UNITED AIRLINES IS RECALLING 1,200 FLIGHT ATTENDANTS

BYLINE:  AP

 BODY:
 United Airlines is recalling 1,200 of the 2,700 flight attendants who were laid off last fall, citing its plan to add flights in April in response to stronger customer demand. 
Almost two-thirds of those being recalled are based at United's Chicago and San Francisco airport hubs. The move brings to 2,000 the number of flight attendants recalled in the last three weeks. United, a unit of the UAL Corporation, announced earlier this month that it would add 127 flights to its daily schedule, currently about 1,700 flights, and recall some flight attendants and furlough fewer pilots.

Shares Are Lower as Nasdaq Scrapes a 4-Month Bottom

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks fell yesterday, driving the Nasdaq composite index to its lowest level in almost four months, on speculation that a profit rebound for telecommunications and computer-related companies might be weaker than forecast.
 Intel and Cisco Systems led the decline. 
 The Nasdaq composite index tumbled 59.33 points, or 3.3 percent, to 1,716.24, its lowest close since Oct. 31. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 106.49 points, or 1.1 percent, to 9,834.68. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 17.03 points, or 1.6 percent, to 1,080.95. 
The Nasdaq has lost 12 percent this year; the S.& P. 500 has fallen 5.9 percent; and the Dow, 1.7 percent.
Intel fell $1.96, or 6.2 percent, to $29.48 after a Banc of America Securities analyst, Douglas Lee, reduced his earnings estimates, citing weakening demand in the second quarter.
Cisco slid $1.58, to $15.11. The New York Post reported that Cisco executives held stakes in a partnership that benefited greatly in the 1990's from ties to Cisco. Cisco executives declined to comment.
Ciena dropped $1.10, to $7.60. The company, the No. 2 maker of fiber optic phone equipment in the United States, said sales this quarter would miss forecasts as two big customers may order less than expected.
Renewed concern over corporate accounting practices hovered over the market. I.B.M. dropped $2.93, to $96.38. The company has lost 20 percent this year amid questions about its accounting practices.
Computer Associates International dropped $2.01, to $18.90, after it tapped a reserve bank line as its short-term financing costs soared on reports that the F.B.I. was investigating its record-keeping.
"It's going to take signs earnings are going to get better to get this market going," said John Waterman of Rittenhouse Financial Services. "Accounting questions add to the lack of confidence."
The American International Group shed $2.68, to $71.04. It received subpoenas from the Securities and Exchange Commission as part of an investigation into the accounting practices of PNC Financial Services, an A.I.G. partner.
"There are still a lot of issues out there with accounting," said Tom Schrader, head of listed trading at Legg Mason Wood Walker. "Almost all companies pay accountants extremely well so they can make their numbers," which may have led to inaccuracies, he said.
Telecommunications services shares dropped after BellSouth reduced its 2002 profit forecast, citing currency devaluation and deteriorating economic conditions in Argentina and Venezuela.
BellSouth, the big local phone-service provider in the Southeast, dropped $2.50, to $37.95. Verizon Communications fell $2.16, to $44.45. --------------------

Treasury Prices Rise
By Reuters
Treasury bond prices rose yesterday, gaining ground as the stock market rally on Wednesday fizzled. 
Longer-dated Treasuries also rose slightly after dealers reversed hedges associated with the sale by Walt Disney of $1.75 billion of 10-year notes and 30-year bonds. 
The 10-year note rose 10/32, to a price of 100 6/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.85 percent from 4.89 percent on Wednesday.
The price of a 30-year bond gained 12/32, to 100 4/32. Its yield fell to 5.36 percent from 5.39 percent.

HEADLINE: Mayor Says Higher Taxi Fares Are Needed to Lure Drivers 

BYLINE:  By DIANE CARDWELL 

 BODY:
New Yorkers can expect a taxi fare increase because the industry cannot attract enough drivers under the current fee structure, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said yesterday.
 "Somehow or other, if you don't make it economically attractive to people to drive taxis, the public's not going to have taxis, and the ways that you basically do it is by raising fees and passing that money on to the drivers," Mr. Bloomberg said. 
 The idea of a higher fare surfaced toward the end of last year, when a segment of the taxi industry petitioned the Taxi and Limousine Commission for a fare increase of 23 percent, which would bring the cost of the average trip to $8.45 from $6.85.
Matthew W. Daus, the commission's chairman, said yesterday that while nothing had been determined as yet, the commissioners had reached a consensus in December that some sort of increase was warranted, but their estimates ranged from 12 to 17 percent instead.
The former mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, had favored an increase tied to the size of the taxis used, so that the larger the cab the higher the fare, an option that is still under consideration as the city begins phasing out small cabs. But a fare increase, Mr. Daus said, would be designed primarily to address the shortage of drivers and to keep pace with the higher costs associated with service and fleet improvements. Mr. Daus estimated that before the Sept. 11 attacks, at least 500 cabs each day had been sitting idle because of the driver shortage, and that since then the problem had intensified. The commission plans to hold a job fair in the middle of March to help fill an estimated 2,000 to 3,000 open jobs.
Mr. Daus added that the commission was also considering a congestion pricing option that would shift the nighttime 50-cent surcharge on cab rides to the morning and evening rush hours to encourage drivers to bring cabs into the city at times when high demand is unmet.
Officials said yesterday that they were sill working on the details of when, how or precisely what sort of increase would go into effect. Mr. Daus explained that the group that had petitioned for a fare increase, the fleet owners, represented only 20 percent of the industry and that the commissioners were waiting for evidence that the increase was warranted from the rest of the industry, individual owner-operators and longterm lease-holders.
Yesterday, Mr. Bloomberg said that he did not know if he would support an increase as high as 20 percent, but said New Yorkers would probably see some sort of increase.
"The fact of the matter is unless you have taxis out in the street the public is not well served at any price," he said.

HEADLINE: Bush, Calling U.S. 'a Nation Guided by Faith,' Urges Freedom of Worship in China 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER

DATELINE: BEIJING, Friday, Feb. 22 

 BODY:
Religious freedom should be welcomed rather than feared, President Bush said in a speech broadcast across China today, and he held up the United States as an example of "a nation guided by faith."
 Mr. Bush repeatedly pressed his theme that religious and political freedom would not lead to chaos, using words that were both a forceful projection of his own religious faith and a subtle criticism of what he sees as the oppressiveness of President Jiang Zemin's government. 
 "Life in America shows that liberty, paired with law, is not to be feared," Mr. Bush said. "In a free society, diversity is not disorder. Debate is not strife. And dissent is not revolution. A free society trusts its citizens to seek greatness in themselves and their country." 
Mr. Bush's remarks, given to students at Tsinghua University in Beijing, came at the end of a six-day, three-nation trip to Asia, and closed a one-day visit to Beijing. He and Mr. Jiang have for the most part presented a united front in the campaign against terrorism and their desire to open up American talks with North Korea. 
Mr. Bush was introduced to the audience by Hu Jintao, an alumnus of Tsinghua University who is almost certain to be Mr. Jiang's successor.
The president's speech, followed by a question-and-answer session with students, contrasted with the almost off-handed reference he made to religious freedom in a joint news conference with Mr. Jiang on Thursday. Mr. Bush made it clear today that the United States expects China, with its booming capitalist economy and Communist government, to move beyond its material success toward the political liberties of the United States. 
"We're a nation of laws," Mr. Bush said. "Our courts are honest and they are independent. The president, me, I can't tell the courts how to rule, and neither can any other member of the executive or legislative branch of government. Under our law, everyone stands equal. No one is above the law, and no one is beneath it."
Mr. Bush added that "all political power in America is limited, and it is temporary, and only given by the free vote of the people."
In the remarks, he called the United States a "nation with the soul of a church."
Mr. Bush recalled how he spoke to Mr. Jiang in Shanghai last October about his own religious beliefs. "I had the honor of sharing with him how faith changed my own life, and how faith contributes to the life of my country," said Mr. Bush, who was raised an Episcopalian, became a Methodist after his marriage and then in 1986 said he was recommitting his heart to Jesus Christ -- a "born-again" experience in the words of evangelicals, although the president has not used that term to describe himself.
"Faith points to a moral law beyond man's law and calls us to duties higher than material gain," Mr. Bush said. "Freedom of religion is not something to be feared, but it's to be welcomed, because faith gives us a moral core and teaches us to hold ourselves to high standards, to love and to serve others and to live responsible lives."
Mr. Bush said that he was hopeful about China's next generation and encouraged by the change he already sees. "Tens of millions of Chinese today are relearning Buddhist, Taoist and local religious traditions, or practicing Christianity, Islam and other faiths," he said. "Regardless of where or how these believers worship, they are no threat to public order."
The president added that "my prayer is that all persecution will end, so that all in China are free to gather and worship as they wish."
Mr. Bush praised some reforms in China's political system, such as secret ballots and competitive local elections, and said he looked forward to an expansion of democratic elections to the national level.
Mr. Bush's address acknowledged that the United States "has its share of problems, no question about that, and we have our faults," and "like most nations, we're on a long journey toward achieving our own ideals of equality and justice." Nonetheless, he said, "there is a reason our nation shines as a beacon of hope and opportunity, a reason many throughout the world dream of coming to America."
The president took pains to describe the America that he said he knows and not the one his audience sees in movies and on television.
Chinese textbooks, Mr. Bush said, "talk of Americans' bullying the weak and repressing the poor." He said that another Chinese textbook published last year teaches that F.B.I. agents are used "to repress the working people." Neither claim is true, Mr. Bush said.
Mr. Bush then told the students that the future of a new nation was in their hands, and that religious and political freedom would lead to a stronger, more vibrant China.
But Mr. Bush's tone was respectful throughout, with words unlikely to be threatening to Mr. Jiang, as he praised the nation's village elections and broadcast grand hopes for a great China. Mr. Bush also painted an image of American freedom intended to appeal to many Chinese.
Religious freedom did not come up in a question and answer session after the president's speech, when Mr. Bush was confronted with two tough questions by students asking him to clarify the United States position on Taiwan. The students asked, first in Chinese and then in their own translated English, why Mr. Bush did not say he was seeking "reunification" of China and Taiwan. 
The second student recalled that Mr. Bush had said in Tokyo three days ago that the United States would remember its "commitment" to Taiwan. "But does the United States still remember its commitment to 1.3 billion Chinese people?" she asked. The questions, as is Chinese custom, were almost certainly vetted beforehand by university officials.
Mr. Bush, taken aback, said first that "this seems to be a topic on people's minds," then answered by repeating longstanding policy that he supported one China, would honor American commitment to Taiwan, and believed in a peaceful resolution of the issue -- an answer that appeared unlikely to satisfy the students and was a step back from former President Clinton's strong support of a one-China policy during a visit here in 1998.
Mr. Bush was also asked about his planned missile defense system, which many Chinese see as a threat aimed at neutralizing their own nuclear forces. Mr. Bush replied that he had yet to develop such a system, and said, "I think it will bring more stability to the world than less."
There were frequent moments of humor in the session at Tsinghua University, one of China's premier educational institutions. At one point, Mr. Bush's Chinese interpreter began to translate his answer into her own excellent English.
"She's correcting my English," Mr. Bush said, to laughter.
At another point, Mr. Bush was asked by a student if he would encourage his twin daughters to study in China. "I'm afraid they don't listen to me anymore, if you know what I mean," Mr. Bush said, again to laughter.
Mr. Bush also spoke during the question and answer section of his astonishment at Beijing, where grand neon swaths of new building and hotels have risen like a mix of Hong Kong and Las Vegas. Mr. Bush was last here in 1975, when he described himself as depressed by the drab sameness of the clothes and the bicycles.
"It is hard for me to describe the difference," Mr. Bush told the students. "It is an amazing transformation."
A Beijing University graduate student in international relations who identified himself by his surname, Wang, watched the question and answer session on television in a campus canteen. "I thought the speech was quite brilliant," he said. "He described how America is not just about wealth but also about values.
"He explained American religion in a way that Chinese can understand," he said. "But the questions were too soft."
Yao Nan, a Beijing University graduate student in economics, said of President Bush, "He answered the questions much better than I expected. I'd heard he was something of a bumbler when he speaks, but he did pretty well." 
Before the speech, Mr. Bush left the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse, the quiet, elaborately landscaped compound where he is staying on the western outskirts of the Forbidden City, to have breakfast with Prime Minister Zhu Rongji.
On Thursday night, Mr. Bush was the guest of honor at a banquet given by Mr. Jiang at the Great Hall of the People, where after dinner Mr. Jiang serenaded the president and Laura Bush, with "O Sole Mio" in Italian, to the accompaniment of an accordion player.
When Mr. Jiang was done, he asked Mr. Bush if he would like to sing. "Secretary Powell would like to sing a song," Mr. Bush replied, indicating his secretary of state, Colin L. Powell. Mr. Powell demurred.

HEADLINE: End of Recession Is Seen, but Strength of Recovery Is Unclear 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 21 

 BODY:
Economists and government officials said today that the recession had almost certainly come to an end but that it remained unclear how strong and sustained the recovery would be.
 White House officials said the economy was growing at a modest but accelerating rate and again credited the tax cut President Bush signed into law last year for minimizing the depth and duration of the downturn. 
 But administration officials reiterated their call for an immediate package of new and accelerated tax cuts, saying the economy still faced problems, including economic weakness abroad, weak corporate profits and the possibility of a recovery, similar to the one after the last recession, in 1990-91, in which the unemployment rate remained high for months or years.
"We've seen jobless recoveries before," said Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans. "We saw one in the early 90's, as a matter of fact. So that's why the president and the administration continue to be very focused on the importance of a stimulus package." 
Their comments suggested that the administration was trying to walk a line between optimism about the economy and continuing to sell a tax-cutting agenda that it had linked to fighting the recession.
The package of tax cuts and other measures has been stalled in Congress for months, and administration officials made no new proposals today to break the partisan deadlock.
But they signaled that they remained solidly behind the efforts of Republicans in the House to keep the package alive in the face of opposition from the Democratic-led Senate.
They also expressed support for the decision by the House Republican leadership to continue to hold up what has been a routine action by government during a recession -- extending unemployment benefits beyond the 26-week limit imposed by most states -- until Democrats agreed to at least some of the tax cuts backed by the White House.
Asked whether the tax cuts and extension of unemployment insurance should be linked in a legislative package, Mr. Bush's chief economic adviser, Lawrence B. Lindsey, told reporters, "The two should be, yes."
Democrats said unemployment benefits were expiring for 11,000 people each day, and the administration and Republicans on Capitol Hill were holding them hostage to their push for tax cuts. With Republicans having blocked a compromise plan offered by Senator Tom Daschle, Democrat of South Dakota, the majority leader, Democrats said the onus was on Mr. Bush and his party to resolve the standoff.
The latest tussle over economic policy occurred as statistics provided more evidence that the economy was on the upswing.
The government reported today that the trade deficit in December fell unexpectedly to $25.3 billion from $28.5 billion a month earlier, a development that economists said meant the economy probably grew at a 1 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter rather than at the initial estimate of 0.2 percent. 
A growth rate of 1 percent in the fourth quarter would be near-certain evidence that the recession was over and that it was short and shallow. The recession began last March, and now appears to have encompassed only one full quarter of negative growth -- last summer, when the economy contracted at a 1.3 percent annual rate.
The recession "probably is over," said William Dudley, chief economist at the investment firm Goldman Sachs. "We're in recovery," Mr. Dudley said, "but we haven't seen all the data yet to confirm that."
The quasi-official arbiter of business cycles, the National Bureau of Economic Research, a private academic group, has not made a judgment about whether the recession has ended. Although recessions are popularly defined as two quarters or more of negative growth, the group uses a more flexible definition that tries to pinpoint peaks and troughs in economic activity.
Many economists say there is little doubt that the recession is either over or in its last stages, a view the administration endorsed today.
R. Glenn Hubbard, chairman of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, said that private-sector forecasts of a 1.5 percent annual growth rate in the first quarter were reasonable and that the latest job-loss statistics were "consistent with recovery being under way."
Mr. Lindsey said the expansion "is here now, and the first quarter is likely to be a fairly good one as these things go." Mr. Evans said there were "lots of signs" that the economy was "beginning to begin its recovery."
But, speaking at a news conference arranged by the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research organization, Mr. Evans, Mr. Lindsey and Mr. Hubbard cautioned that a smooth and robust recovery could not be taken for granted.
Mr. Evans said, "The business leaders that I talk to -- small, medium and large -- are still saying that they don't feel the strength of the recovery yet."
Mr. Hubbard said "there are important downside risks remaining" that justified the administration's continued support for an economic recovery package. 
The package passed by the House would accelerate some of the individual income tax rate cuts in last year's tax bill, provide tax incentives to businesses to invest in new equipment and reduce the corporate alternative minimum tax. It would also provide a one-time payment of up to $300 per person to many low-income workers and extend unemployment benefits by 13 weeks.
Administration officials said the package was particularly needed to help ensure a rebound in capital spending by businesses. 
Unlike most recessions, which are characterized as much by downturns in consumer spending as in business activity, this one was marked by relative strength in consumer spending. But capital spending by companies on equipment like computers, software and telecommunications technology plummeted.
As the recovery unfolds, the economy is not likely to get much of a lift from the consumer because consumer spending never weakened much, economists said. So the big question is how strongly capital spending will bounce back.
A survey released by the National Association of Manufacturers found that 45 percent of its members expected to increase their capital spending in the first half of this year by as much as 5 percent, while 38 percent said they anticipated a continued decline in capital spending.
The outlook for unemployment -- and therefore for the political implications of the economy -- remains muddled. The unemployment rate has historically continued to rise for some months after a recession; after the last recession ended in March 1991, unemployment drifted up for 15 months, to 7.8 percent from 6.8 percent, hurting the re-election prospects in 1992 of President Bush's father. The rate is now 5.6 percent.
Some economists said the rate was likely to hit 6.5 percent before falling. Others said it would not rise much more. "Labor market data is sending a clear message: the unemployment rate is likely to peak at 6 percent or less," said a report today from L. Douglas Lee of Economics from Washington, a consulting firm.

HEADLINE: New Clues Emerge on Mayor's Welfare Policy 

BYLINE:  By NINA BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
With critics and champions of the last administration's brand of welfare reform watching closely for signs of policy change, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg sent mixed signals yesterday.
 First came the news that the mayor was shifting responsibility for tens of millions of dollars in federal job training money to the city's Department of Employment from the city's welfare agency, where it went largely unspent under the previous commissioner's work-first philosophy. 
 That move seemed to underscore Mr. Bloomberg's bottom-line approach to problems previously framed by ideological divisions. 
But then Mr. Bloomberg's new welfare commissioner, Verna Eggleston, announced that like her predecessor, Jason Turner, she would not accept a federal waiver from food stamp rules. The waiver would have allowed jobless adults without children to receive food stamps beyond the current limit of three months in a three-year period. 
"We can do more for our clients by declining the waiver and by identifying each individual's capacity and tailoring assistance to move them to the maximum possible level of self-sufficiency," Ms. Eggleston said in a written statement.
Directors of food banks said they were dismayed by the decision to decline the waiver, available to areas with insufficient jobs. Several said that Mr. Bloomberg in this case appeared to be deferring to the Republican Party's right wing, rather than seeking the practical benefits of additional dollars in federal food stamp sales at no local cost.
"He's definitely been sending mixed signals," said Joel Berg, director of the New York City Coalition Against Hunger, which represents more than 1,000 soup kitchens and food pantries in the city. "He made a very public show of visiting a soup kitchen around the holidays, and then he turns around and makes a policy decision that will hurt the very agency that he visited." 
Mr. Berg added: "Bloomberg really did bow to a very small handful of very right-wing ideologues."
But David Neustadt, a spokesman for the Human Resources Administration, said refusing the waiver would have little practical effect. "No one who is willing to comply with the minimal 20-hour-a-week requirement for work-related activity will be cut off food stamps," he said.
Experts on food stamp policy, however, said the city administration had misunderstood the waiver, and that it would have added flexibility at a time of rising unemployment, rather than ending work requirements.
Kathy Goldman, executive director of the Community Food Resource Center, said 37 counties and 10 cities in New York State had taken the waiver. "Let's assume that somebody thought it was right before Sept. 11," she said. "How could you in all good conscience take that position in a city that lost 100,000 jobs?"
Ms. Goldman and Mr. Berg both attributed the unexpected decision to a column by Heather McDonald, an associate of the Manhattan Institute, strongly opposing the waiver. The column, which appeared last week in The New York Post, declared that the waiver would be "the test" of "where the Bloomberg-Eggleston administration stands on work and self-sufficiency."
"Even the state welfare bureaucracy urged the city to apply for a food-stamp work waiver," Ms. McDonald wrote. "This 'soak the feds' view is dangerously short-sighted, however: the longer the dependency culture is nurtured, the greater and more perpetual the claims on state and city budgets."
Such philosophical arguments took a back seat yesterday when Ms. Eggleston testified before the City Council's General Welfare Committee about $67 million in federal job training money that the city must use by June 30 or lose forever.
She said working parents who earned too little to leave welfare would be offered a voucher for free job training to improve their earning power.
The federal law requires that a board dominated by private business help determine how the money will be spent and calls for one-stop centers offering training and education. Bill de Blasio, chairman of the committee, said the Giuliani administration had neglected the role of private industry. Los Angeles has 24 of the one-stop centers, but New York City has only one, he said. "We hope that a mayor who happens to be a businessman will actually train people for long-term jobs."

Korean Official Defends Seoul's Efforts on Economy

BYLINE:  By DON KIRK

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Feb. 22 

 BODY:
South Korea's finance minister, Jin Nyum, said today that the job of imposing financial discipline on the country's deeply indebted companies belonged to lenders, not the government, but that the country's banks were not yet up to the task.
 In an interview at the Finance Ministry, Mr. Jin defended his government's efforts so far to restructure the economy, saying that progress was being made despite "lots of resistance from political groupings, business and trade unions." 
 Still, "we have to try harder," he said.
From one side, he said, the Federation of Korean Industry blasts the government for involving itself too much in regulating business. From another comes equally severe criticism whenever the government tries to help a company, on the ground that the government is backsliding from commitments made to the International Monetary Fund as a condition for a $58 billion rescue package in December 1997.
And analysts worry that the relatively rapid rebound from last year's downturn will entice both the banks and the government to revert to old habits of easy credit and lax controls that helped to precipitate the 1997 economic crisis.
Paul Gruenwald, the fund's representative in Seoul, observed at a recent government-sponsored development seminar that "progress in structural reform has been slower" than economic recovery. Many large companies have allowed their debts to climb back above a ceiling of two times equity that the government imposed in 1998, he said, and they should be made to reduce their debts, not borrow more.
"We do not interfere in corporate management," Mr. Jin said in the interview. When it comes to policing borrowers' financial health, he said, "the banking institutions should take that function, but they do not have the power yet." For them to do so, he said, will require "changes in the mind-set on financing accountability." On this front, he said, "the reform effort is half done."
His preference for a hands-off stance by the government did not necessarily extend to some of the giant corporate invalids that the country is trying to deal with, like Daewoo Motor and Hynix Semiconductor, he said. 
Creditors of each of those companies, with government encouragement, have been trying to sell them to American buyers -- General Motors and Micron Technology -- but negotiations have dragged on much longer than expected. Mr. Jin denied that "our poor negotiating capabilities and differences in culture" were to blame for delays. 
"The U.S. partners complain that Korean partners think not of present value but of how much they have invested in the past," Mr. Jin said. "The Korean partners complain the Americans are going to take valuable assets at far below equity." He dismissed complaints that an improving economic outlook had led the Korean side to try to drive too hard a bargain. "You have to make the best price," he said. "Now is the time for both parties to reach agreement."
The major cloud on the East Asian horizon, he said, remains the situation in Japan. "We are worrying about the Japanese economy a lot," he said. "We live in quite an interdependent world, and we hope the Japanese government will manage the economy better. In the past, they were one of the major pillars of the global economy."

HEADLINE: Arise, Ye Prisoners Of Starvation 

BYLINE:  By Bill Keller; E-mail: billkeller@nytimes.com

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
One way to measure Russia's slow recovery from the 70-year coma of Communism is to count lobster tanks and sushi bars. Old Russia hands like me, who remember when a banana was more wondrous than a Faberge egg, swoon at the profusion of delicacies available these days in the bright showcase cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg.
 My own crude index of the economic condition, however, is the brazen yellow M that now seems to illuminate every other corner of this winter-gray city. California rolls and foie gras are evidence of the great wealth enjoyed by an industrious few, some of whom are even industrious at legitimate businesses. McDonald's is a barometer of how the wealth has seeped out beyond the elite. It tells you a bit about how Russia is doing at the critical business of building a middle class. Drop into a McDonald's here, and you find Russians who scarcely existed a dozen years ago -- Russians with decent clothes and healthy teeth, Russians with jobs that give them spare time and cash for a family splurge, Russians with, polls show, a flicker of optimism. You find Russians who have more or less achieved their plaintive ambition to be "normal people." 
 Whether this represents an improvement in culinary or nutritional standards in Russia is another conversation, although those who want to argue the evils of cholesterol should know you're talking about a country where a slab of pork fat on buttered bread is considered the ideal accompaniment to a jolt of vodka. There is also a fine term paper to be written comparing the regimental good cheer of McDonald's cadres to Lenin's Young Pioneers, but we'll leave that for another class.
As a business venture, McDonald's has been not just an indicator of economic advance but a contributor to it. At this point, globophobes may want to leave the room. I know that elsewhere in the world McDonald's is a swell symbol of American cultural imperialism -- blockaded by French farmers, bombed by Turkish protesters and most recently vandalized by Pakistanis angry at American bombing raids in Afghanistan. In Russia, McDonald's is a lesson in the salutary potential of globalization when a company comes to stay rather than strip-mine.
The story begins in the Gorbachev era, when the abject failure of the Soviet economy became clear to all but the most deluded. In farming towns you found spoiled land, demoralized workers, broken-down equipment, wheat rotting in the open. Agriculture occupied an astounding 19 percent of the work force (in the U.S. the figure was 3 percent), yet even in a good year the country imported millions of tons of grain.
Mr. Gorbachev, himself a farm boy, led a frantic hunt for ways to fix it, and for a time the countryside was beset by reformers and rainmakers of all kinds, devoted to saving Russia from starvation. There were idealistic young administrators who tried to invigorate collective farms by turning spiritually depleted farm workers into shareholders. There were family farms and sharecropping schemes. I met a few solo farmers back then teaching themselves agronomy out of library books. Dutch experts arrived bearing "turnkey potato projects," little swatches of Holland planted in Moscow's exurbs. Mr. Gorbachev and then Boris Yeltsin tried incentives, they tried hectoring, they tried firing agriculture ministers by the bushel.
All these well-intentioned efforts ran up against a killing reality: There was no marketplace in which to sell. The Soviet Union had one insatiable customer, the state, which prescribed what farms could grow, established quotas, set prices and monopolized distribution. No one wanted to dismantle this creaky arrangement for fear of chaos, hunger and revolt. This meant that a farmer who mustered the energy to grow more than his obligations to the state had nowhere to sell the surplus except in neighborhood produce bazaars, where the prices were more or less fixed.
Enter McDonald's. The company arrived late in the first wave of Western companies that had come to cash in if Russia succeeded. Most were opportunists looking to import Western products and skim the dollars of foreign expatriates, tourists and the lucky Russian rich. But McDonald's threw itself into the deep end. From the outset, it sold food to Russians -- for rubles. And since rubles were then next to worthless outside Russia, it began looking for Russian suppliers.
McDonald's scouts trolled the countryside for ambitious young farm directors, offering a premium price if they would provide beef and milk and pickles to the company's rigid specifications. The reactions ranged from suspicion to ridicule to slack-jawed amazement, as if these guys had come not from McDonald's but Mars. 
Viktor Semyonov, who runs a farm south of Moscow, told me the other day that when McDonald's first showed up, offering to pay rubles if he would grow some strange lettuce called "iceberg," a deputy rudely dismissed the visitors. A silly idea, he insisted, and anyway an American company (actually it was the Canadian branch of the company that opened the Russian frontier) should pay dollars. Mr. Semyonov, who had a nose for an opportunity, sent his man to grovel before the foreigners. His farm is now a prosperous supplier of vegetables and herbs from acres of efficient, computer-sprinkled greenhouses. Mr. Semyonov went on to serve a term as minister of agriculture.
By the opening of the first store McDonald's had managed to obtain a fourth of its ingredients from Russian sources. Now the company has 100 Russian suppliers who provide 75 percent of what goes into the restaurants here. The company's processing center outside Moscow (it goes by the cringe-inducing name of McComplex) even exports fruit pies to Germany -- payback, perhaps, for all the trainloads of charity food the Germans sent here during the various famine scares of the Gorbachev era.
Thus did the McDonald's model provide a missing link between would-be Russian farmers and would-be Russian consumers. McDonald's did not save Russia. Russia, in fact, is still some distance from being saved, as insider syndicates and provincial feudalism dominate much of the economy, including the big farms. But the country no longer totally defies the laws of supply and demand.
Although there has always been in Russia a streak of messianic estrangement from the West, the globalization backlash has not taken hold here, at least not yet. In the early days, McDonald's was as much a spectacle as a place to eat -- a heartbreaking reminder of how pathetically far behind this superpower was. Visitors from distant cities flew home with hamburgers, as if bearing relics of civilization. Once in those early days, after an Aeroflot flight to Baku, in Azerbaijan, I hitched a ride in from the airport with a family coming home from business in Moscow. As the driver raced along the highway, one of my fellow passengers reached across the seat and proudly offered me an eight-hour-old Big Mac from a bag of them brought home as souvenirs.
The novelty has diminished as a competitive abundance of decent, home-grown cafes and fast-food outlets materialized in McDonald's wake, but today Russians still greet the opening of a McDonald's as a vote of confidence in the neighborhood, not to mention a clean, well-lit place to congregate and a source of scarce jobs for local youngsters. The jobs, more than 9,000 of them now, pay poorly, but a little less poorly than most other employers, and they pay on time in a country where wages often lag many months behind. The training includes heavy indoctrination in a work ethic that had been smothered by Soviet complacency. Unlike companies that came for the easy profits -- Pizza Hut comes to mind -- McDonald's weathered the economic storms and devaluations of the late 1990's without layoffs. A company that started under expatriate management is now run entirely by Russians.
"Yes, we think globally, but we act locally," says the president of the Russian venture, Khamzat Khasbulatov, reciting a bit of company propaganda that, here at least, is true. And if all this makes you feel less guilty about the times you succumbed to your brainwashed child's demand for a Happy Meal -- O.K. by me.
So how is Vladimir Putin's economy doing, on my highly scientific McDonald's Index? It's on a slow climb out of a very deep hole.
From the first hamburger emporium that opened on Pushkin Square in January 1990, still the busiest outlet in the world, McDonald's has grown to 74 restaurants. They have now begun to spread beyond the outskirts of Moscow to a few provincial cities like Nizhny Novgorod, Rostov-on-Don, Yaroslavl and Kazan. The plan is to keep expanding by 20 or 25 stores a year. 
According to my calculations, judged by the number of McDonald's outlets per capita, Russia will be Canada in -- hmm, about 70 years.

HEADLINE: Protecting Media Diversity 

 BODY:
Congress, the Federal Communications Commission and the courts have all taken turns in recent years chiseling away at the intricate web of media ownership rules aimed at preserving competition and a diversity of voices in the nation's information marketplace. This week the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit nullified the F.C.C.'s cross-ownership rule, which prevents one company from owning a cable system and a local broadcast station in the same market. It also held that the agency had offered insufficient justification for the rule preventing any one owner of stations from reaching more than 35 percent of the nation's TV households. 
 Like the same court's ruling last year discarding limits on cable systems' nationwide reach, and earlier moves by Congress and the F.C.C. to strike down other ownership rules, the appeals court's decision is likely to accelerate mergers, and encourage the concentration of power, in the media industry. If the court's decision stands, a cable giant like AOL Time Warner could acquire a TV broadcast network. Local affiliates, for their part, will lose much of their remaining bargaining power with national networks that are less interested in promoting local news and public-interest programming. 
 The gradual dismantling of ownership rules has been a reaction to changing political sentiment and rapid, often unpredictable, technological innovation that has increasingly tested longstanding regulations. This page has in the past argued for the preservation of most of these ownership limits, but we recognize that their rollback now seems irreversible. 
That being the case, a new debate needs to take place about where, and how, to draw limits on media concentration in this country. Americans do not want to wake up someday to realize that, as a result of mergers between cable operators, TV networks, local broadcast stations, radio networks and newspaper chains, they must rely on only two or three corporations for all their entertainment and, more to the point, their news. It is important to the health of a democracy that a few powerful economic interests do not monopolize information outlets. 
A degree of sensible deregulation can recognize changes in the marketplace and allow for the greater economies of scale that encourage the development of new technologies beneficial to consumers and support stronger programming. The current regulatory framework also creates a climate of uncertainty because the 1996 Telecommunications Act requires the F.C.C. to revisit and defend its TV ownership rules every two years.
So far, however, deregulation has been a disjointed process that has produced a patchwork of uneven and inequitable regulation. This week's court decision, for instance, leaves companies that are primarily in the entertainment business with a freer hand than those committed to distributing news and information. Over time, that promises to constrict the flow of information to citizens, weakening the circulatory system of American democracy. 
It would be far better if there were a more holistic approach to deregulation. The New York Times Company, owner of television stations as well as newspapers, may itself benefit from new business opportunities as ownership rules are relaxed. As is true with many of the smaller media companies, it will also face new distribution obstacles. 
Congress has an important role to play in restructuring the regulatory system to make it equitable and ensure that F.C.C. actions and court decisions do not ultimately produce a world without any regulation. Michael Powell, the chairman of the F.C.C., also has a responsibility to protect the public interest by managing deregulation in a way that preserves a diversity of news, opinion and entertainment. Mergers between media giants should continue to receive special scrutiny, above and beyond traditional antitrust review. Even in the absence or modification of some ownership rules, Mr. Powell needs to protect the public interest. To cite one example, the F.C.C. should consider expanding rules that prevent cable operators that own TV stations or Internet services from discriminating against competitors. 
This week's appeals court decision was a victory for media giants like AOL Time Warner and News Corporation. The court, however, rejected the companies' claims that the rules were inherently unconstitutional. This leaves the door wide open for Congress to take a fresh look at the whole issue.

HEADLINE: Frozen Foods Show Upturn in Taste and Sales 

BYLINE:  By KATE MURPHY

 BODY:
For decades, frozen food meant granular fish sticks, cardboard crust pizzas and portion-controlled diet meals. Bland and low budget, frozen food was most often eaten in front of the television -- which provided a welcome distraction from the taste. 
 But no more. Recent improvements in technology, ingredients and packaging have raised the culinary status of frozen food. Companies from giant food conglomerates to small, specialized health food makers are developing new frozen foods -- sometimes recruiting famous chefs to help. And supermarkets, attracted by the relatively high profit margins on frozen food, have rushed to increase freezer space. 
 With consumers continuing to lose interest in home cooking and the weak economy making restaurants more of a luxury, frozen food sales are rising sharply. Sales of frozen prepared foods reached $7.2 billion in 2001, up from $6.7 billion in 2000, according to the market research firm ACNielsen. 
In contrast, the number of meals eaten at restaurants declined 3 percent and the number of takeout meals consumed declined 4 percent for the year that ended in February 2001, according to the market research firm NPD Group.
"Frozen is what people are buying for home meal replacement these days," said Bruce T. Peterson, senior vice president and general merchandise manager for perishables at Wal-Mart Stores Inc. "If you get a rotisserie chicken at a supermarket deli you still have to get all the side dishes. With frozen dinners, it's all in one." 
Preparation time for frozen food is rarely as long as table service at a restaurant or waiting for the delivery guy. And with the average meal costing $2.95, it is less expensive than lunch or dinner out. Sandelman & Associates, a market research firm, says the average spending per person at a fast-food restaurant is $4.32, and at a casual dining restaurant it reaches $11.72.
"At the end of the day, people don't like to cook, and frozen food manufacturers have finally come out with better-tasting products that are competitive with restaurants and takeout," said John McMillin, food industry analyst at Prudential Securities in New York. 
The changes in frozen food started with the "rising crust" pizza five years ago. The crust actually fluffed while it baked, giving it the taste and consistency of pies from a pizzeria. Manufacturers like Kraft Foods and Schwan's also improved the quality of the toppings, and sales of frozen pizza soared. That success reawakened the interest of food producers in the long-dormant frozen prepared food category. 
Manufacturers have also taken advantage of improved freezing techniques. Over the last seven years, most of them have adopted the "individual quick freezing" method -- a meal's ingredients are separated and spread out on a sheet before they get a blast of cryogenic gas. This keeps the different parts of a dish from clumping and forming large ice crystals, which degrade the flavor of food when it is thawed and reheated.
Manufacturers have also developed several new ways to add sauces, spices and flavorings. Techniques include spraying on sauces to improve distribution, adding frozen flavor "lozenges" that melt into the food when heated and enclosing a separate sauce packet. 
Packaging now protects against freezer burn more effectively, and the sizes and shapes of containers have been redesigned so foods heat more evenly in microwaves as well as conventional ovens.
"You used to get parts that would come out overcooked and parts that would be undercooked," said Robert L. Garfield, senior vice president for regulatory and technological affairs at the American Frozen Food Institute, a trade association in McLean, Va.
Using the new technologies, nearly all the leading manufacturers of frozen dinners and entrees have revamped and expanded their product lines. Food manufacturers introduced 248 frozen dinners and entrees last year, according to the market research firm Information Resources Inc. 
"They're using better ingredients and offering a wider variety of cuisine" like Southwestern, Asian and Italian, said David A. Wellman, editor of Frozen Food Age, a trade magazine. Nestle alone added 70 frozen meals to its Stouffer's and Lean Cuisine lines in the last four years. Last September, the company also broke ground on a 325,000-square-foot frozen food manufacturing plant in Jonesboro, Ark. 
Other large food companies are starting frozen food subsidiaries or acquiring smaller frozen food makers. The H. J. Heinz Company, for one, bought the Linda McCartney and Ethnic Gourmet brands, and Mars Inc. began its Uncle Ben's line of frozen food. Even those outside the food industry are becoming interested: Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst Inc., a buyout company in Dallas, acquired Swanson, a Vlasic Foods brand, as well as the frozen food division of King's Hawaiian last year to form the Pinnacle Foods Corporation.
"It's an incredibly attractive category with a lot of growth potential," said Neil Harrison, president and chief executive of the Heinz Frozen Food Company. At a time when consumers are "time and energy constrained," he said, "frozen food is the answer."
There have been so many acquisitions of small frozen food makers that only a few remain independent. One is Amy's Kitchen Inc., a company in Petaluma, Calif., that makes organic frozen entrees and snacks. "We're not interested in being acquired," said Andrew Berliner, president and co-owner, with his wife, Rachel. But he said it was a "tremendous challenge" for a small company to compete with a large corporation for shelf space. Still, sales at Amy's Kitchen increased 20 percent last year, he said, to $100 million.
Some of the most popular frozen food offerings are bowl and skillet meals, which were introduced three years ago. Bowl meals -- frozen food layered in a disposable and microwave-safe bowl -- free the consumer from cooking and also from cleaning any dishes. Skillet meals are sacks of frozen food that consumers dump in a pan and heat for 15 to 20 minutes to make a complete meal.
Stephanie Fagnani, an editor for the trade publication Supermarket News, said, "Consumers want to be able to say, 'Look what I made' after doing as little as possible."
With the opportunity to stir and maybe add a dash of hot sauce or a pinch of herbs, these meals allow "convenient involvement," said Rosalyn Z. O'Hearn, director of brand affairs for the prepared food division of Nestle USA. "It's what our research tells us people want," she said.
Several large food manufacturers have also worked with restaurant chains and well-known chefs to develop restaurant-brand frozen foods. For example, Heinz now sells Boston Market and TGI Friday's frozen meals, and ConAgra Foods Inc. offers the Marie Callender and Wolfgang Puck lines. Even Corky's Bar-B-Q, a Memphis rib joint, has its own line of frozen food. 
Grocery stores are happy to offer more frozen food, because gross margins are about 10 percent higher than those for dry goods, according to two managers of perishable food departments. Wal-Mart and Albertson's have increased their frozen food departments by 25 percent to 40 percent in both new and existing stores. 
"The category is a significant contributor to profits," said Lawrence A. Hansen, group vice president for grocery sales and procurement for Albertson's, which is based in Boise, Idaho.
Mr. Peterson of Wal-Mart said: "We started adding significant space to our frozen areas three years ago" by converting from coffin style to upright freezer cases and adding more linear square footage. It's clear frozen food is what customers are moving toward."

HEADLINE: Redeveloping Ground Zero: Questions Grow On Oversight 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Larry A. Silverstein has a new proposal for rebuilding his office tower at 7 World Trade Center later this year that he hopes will finally address all the objections from local residents and downtown officials.
 But even as Mr. Silverstein presses to begin construction in June, some top state officials, civic organizations and community groups say they are considering whether to scuttle Mr. Silverstein's development rights on the larger and adjacent trade center site and prevent him from taking part in the broader reconstruction project, which promises to be one of the most ambitious urban development programs in the country. 
 Mr. Silverstein controls the lease for the 16-acre World Trade Center site, but in recent weeks he has focused on plans for a tower just to the north, 7 World Trade Center. He has a much freer hand at 7 World Trade Center to build than he does on the site of the two main towers. 
Mr. Silverstein's new design for the 7 World Trade Center site is smaller -- 1.6 million square feet instead of the original 2 million -- and shifted to the south. The tower's new position would allow for the re-establishment of Greenwich Street through the trade center site, a goal of many downtown groups. The tower would also accommodate Con Edison's substations, which supplied much of the electricity for Lower Manhattan before they were destroyed last September.
Despite mixed signals in past weeks, it appears that Mr. Silverstein has a good chance of gaining approval to rebuild 7 World Trade Center before an overall design is completed for rebuilding Lower Manhattan.
At a meeting earlier this week, John C. Whitehead, chairman of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation and a critic of Mr. Silverstein's plans, seemed to have had a change of heart. "I believe it's desirable, if possible, for the reconstruction of that building to proceed promptly," he said. Mr. Silverstein, who would need the approval of the Port Authority and Con Edison, is just beginning to show his latest proposal to government officials and community organizations.
As for the trade center site, Mr. Silverstein has said he wants to build four large office towers, as well as a museum and cultural center. But some officials are irked by his aggressive approach, saying it will take time to design a master plan for the area. In the meantime, they are wondering if it is possible to shed Mr. Silverstein.
The developer does have some leverage, however, in the form of his insurance policy on the trade center complex, which could provide $3.55 billion to $6.7 billion for reconstruction. The developer is in a legal dispute with his insurance companies over the total, but an initial $150 million in proceeds has been used for rent, mortgage payments and Mr. Silverstein's management fees and planning proposals. 
If the Port Authority and Mr. Silverstein part, insurance analysts and others estimate that Mr. Silverstein would have to give the Port Authority $1.5 billion of the proceeds and negotiate over $1 billion to $2 billion. 
"Plenty of people are wondering what to do with Larry," said a top state official who spoke on condition of anonymity. "Whatever the decision, it should be done sooner rather than later because he's drawing down the insurance proceeds. It's not going into rebuilding."
Few people are willing to talk about the situation publicly. And it is often difficult to discern what is going on among city, state and downtown officials when their public comments are often at odds with what is said behind closed doors. Underlying the apparent confusion are complex legal issues, billions in insurance money and election-year politics in which Gov. George E. Pataki does not want to hand his opponents an issue with which to attack him.
"There's a lot of dancing around legal and political niceties going on here," said Robert D. Yaro, president of the Regional Plan Association. "It's still not clear what Silverstein plans to develop, or how the public planning and development process will work. There are enormous public concerns, particularly among Lower Manhattan community groups, civic organizations and others about getting it right."
Neither Mr. Silverstein nor Mr. Whitehead returned calls requesting comment.
Governor Pataki controls much of what happens downtown by virtue of his leading role with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the trade center site; the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which controls the subways; and the Empire State Development Corporation. The state and the city also established the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation as a quasi-independent body to oversee downtown reconstruction, although it is a subsidiary of Empire State.
Mr. Silverstein built 7 World Trade Center on Port Authority land in the 1980's and gained control of the trade center complex last July in a $3.2 billion deal with the Port Authority. Under the terms of his leases with the authority, Mr. Silverstein has the right to rebuild the tower and the complex, so long as he replaces what was there before Sept. 11.
Many urban planners, civic groups and public officials contend that a broad public discussion about how to rebuild the area and create a memorial to the victims of the attack should lead to the development of the overall design, which could include cultural centers, parks, transportation improvements and housing, not just office space.
Mr. Silverstein, in turn, has upset some civic organizations by rushing to build his tower and bypassing the public debate. There is also widespread agreement that the city's streets should be extended through the trade center site.
"This appears to be the first redevelopment decision to be made," said Mr. Yaro, a founder of the Civic Alliance, an umbrella group active downtown. "Recreating the street grid is a critical piece of it." 
Many people involved in the rebuilding effort were left puzzling over the state's intentions when Charles A. Gargano, the state's chief development executive and vice chairman of the Port Authority, expressed support for Mr. Silverstein's plans to begin construction of 7 World Trade Center in June when he spoke at a Feb. 7 planning conference. But later that day, Louis R. Tomson, who was appointed president of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation by Governor Pataki, said at the same conference that Mr. Silverstein should not go forward until there was a clear plan for the entire area.
Around the same time, Port Authority executives were telephoning developers close to Mr. Silverstein, urging them to get Mr. Silverstein to back off, according to real estate executives who were briefed on the conversations.
Two state officials said that while they did not want Mr. Silverstein to get into a public brawl with downtown groups, they did favor his project because it would serve as a physical expression of the rebuilding effort. They also said that Mr. Gargano did not want to provide Mr. Silverstein with a potential legal reason for refusing to pay his rent to the Port Authority by claiming that the state had violated his lease. 
Since then, Mr. Silverstein has redrawn his proposed tower to try to placate the downtown groups. And Moody's, a bond rating agency, has downgraded the bonds on Mr. Silverstein's existing mortgage, because of the current glut of office space. 
But while Mr. Silverstein would essentially be replacing the tower at 7 World Trade Center, the trade center site is a different matter altogether, if only because there will be no 110-story towers and there will be a memorial, which could take up as much as eight acres. 
Marc Wolinsky, a lawyer for Mr. Silverstein, said the developer had no intention of walking away. "We're not in this to take the money and go home," he said.

PERSON: Jonas Savimbi 

HEADLINE: Jonas Savimbi, 67, Rebel Of Charisma and Tenacity 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN 

 BODY:
Jonas Savimbi, who was killed yesterday by Angolan government soldiers, spent more than 35 years in the African bush battling first for Angolan independence and then for personal power.
 Mr. Savimbi, 67, was among the more charismatic rebels on the continent. The burly leader was easily recognized by his lumbering gait, menacing scowl, combat fatigues, pistol and black beret, all of which served to obscure his Swiss doctorate in political science. 
 He first led armed fighters against Angola's Portuguese rulers in the 1960's, using the tactics of a "people's war" that he had learned in Communist China. A decade later, when the war-weary Portuguese withdrew in 1975, he became one of the contenders in a three-way tribally based struggle for power. This civil war, with its contrary claims to patronage and governance, quickly became enmeshed in global politics as the rival superpowers and their proxies rushed to sponsor their chosen factions. 
The Soviets sent arms and the Cubans sent troops to help the leftist government in Luanda -- the M.P.L.A., or the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola -- headed by Agostinho Neto, a Marxist doctor and poet. The United States and its allies backed Holden Roberto and his Front for the National Liberation of Angola (F.N.L.A.), an organization that commanded the allegiance of the Bakongo peoples of the north. Mr. Savimbi, the youngest of the three leaders, had his own power base among the Ovambundu and other southern tribes who had provided fighters for his Unita faction, an acronym for the Portuguese equivalent of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola.
As for military backing, Mr. Savimbi took it wherever he could, a little from China, some ragtag mercenaries, diamond smugglers and, most controversially, from the then white supremacist government of South Africa. A lifelong admirer of Che Guevara, he nonetheless became the darling of Western anti-Communists.. 
Though the civil war that broke out in 1975 was fought largely in remote regions of a country that is twice the size of Texas, it marked the opening wheeze in what was to be Moscow's last interventionist gasp.. 
By the late 1980's Cuba had 50,000 soldiers there and the South African Defense Forces were actively fighting on the other side with Mr. Savimbi. But then, after more than a decade of warfare, Communism as a global force vanished. The Soviet Union collapsed, and South Africa abandoned apartheid. As a result, the international aspects of the Angolan conflict seemed less pressing. 
Still, the fighting continued, though Mr. Roberto and his F.N.L.A. had dropped out of the picture. The warfare, at times interrupted by fragile truces, pitted Mr. Savimbi and his men against the Luanda government that was accepted by most African states, though not recognized by the United States until 1993.
The country of about 10 million people is rich in oil, coal, diamonds and farmland, but after decades of fighting it lay devastated. More than a million of its people have been killed or wounded. Once attractive cities like Luanda and Huambo have become ruins where orphaned children seek security in sewers, and the country has a higher percentage of limbless citizens maimed by land mines than any other. 
In 1996, Thomas L. Friedman, a columnist for The New York Times, traveled in Angola asking people what the fighting was about. A 23-year-old soldier who had spent the previous eight years as a warrior for Mr. Savimbi said, "I don't know if there was ever a reason for this war." President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, who as Dr. Neto's successor and president of Angola was Mr. Savimbi's chief adversary, said he knew of "no ideological reason to have a war." 
Mr. Savimbi was born on Aug. 3, 1934, in a village along the Benguela railroad line where his father, Lote, was a stationmaster. His parents were members of the Ovimbundu tribe, which represents some 40 percent of Angola's population. Lote Savimbi was a Protestant preacher, so active in the organization of congregations and schools that Catholic churchmen repeatedly asked railroad officials to send him to new posts. As the family moved, young Jonas picked up his father's compelling oratorical skills and detailed knowledge about the railroad. 
This information would later serve him when as a guerrilla leader he organized attacks on the line that was one of southern Africa's vital commercial links, transporting copper and other ores from Zaire, Zambia and Zimbabwe. By cutting the railroad, Unita paralyzed Angola's economy.
A bright student, Mr. Savimbi was accepted by an elite Portuguese high school where graduated at the top of his class. In 1958 he went to Lisbon to study medicine. There he became active in the struggle for Angolan independence, and when the Portuguese secret police pressured him to inform on his associates, he fled for Lausanne, where he changed his field of study to politics. He received his doctorate in 1965.
As early as 1961, Mr. Roberto had named Mr. Savimbi as foreign minister of his self-proclaimed Angolan government in exile. Angered by what he regarded as Mr. Roberto's favoritism of the Bakongo, he resigned and flirted with the Marxist M.P.L.A. But when Dr. Neto's movement denied him a seat on its governing council, he went to look for sponsorship first in Moscow and then in China. The Russians turned him down, but the Chinese were interested. Late in 1965 they invited him and 12 of his colleagues to study guerrilla warfare. 
Infiltrating back into the Portuguese colony in 1966, he founded Unita in a remote village in Moxico province and began military operations.. During the fighting for independence, tensions between the three groups and their chiefs prevented a common strategy and the Portuguese were able to maintain control of Angola for nine years after Mr. Savimbi took up arms. Then, on April 25, 1974, leftist-leaning officers in Lisbon overthrew the dictatorship of Marcelo Caetano and pledged to end the colonial wars.
As the Portuguese military withdrew along with 300,000 Portuguese settlers, Angola became independent on Nov. 11, 1975. With an eye to possible benefactors, Mr. Savimbi pragmatically recast himself as an anti-Communist. 
Fighting continued throughout the 1980's. Unita raided the railroad and government posts and established itself in the diamond region. In 1986, Mr. Savimbi traveled to Washington in search of military aid, meeting with President Reagan, whose administration provided him with a $15 million package of covert assistance. In June 1989, President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire convened a peace meeting at which Mr. Savimbi and President dos Santos agree to a cease-fire. Two months later it collapsed in heavy fighting. 
On May 31, 1991, in Lisbon, the two men signed a peace accord calling for national elections. Mr. dos Santos won the first round of balloting in 1992, but Mr. Savimbi claimed widespread fraud. Before a second round of voting took place, Mr. Savimbi pulled out of the agreement and the fighting resumed.
Seemingly facing military defeat in 1994, Mr. Savimbi agreed to peace terms, but said he could not leave his hideout for the signing ceremony in Zambia because the Angolan government would kill him. Since then, the country has continued to be riven by conflict, though generally it has been less intense.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; 
In Argentina, I.M.F. Impasse Heightens Fear On Economy

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Feb. 22 

 BODY:
Though Argentina and the International Monetary Fund are once again discussing new loans to help ease the country's economic crisis, a fundamental obstacle has emerged. The Argentine government says it cannot carry out the economic changes that the fund and other creditors are demanding unless it receives fresh money from abroad first, but foreign lenders say they cannot advance the country any new money until after it has shown some results.
 "We need to break the circle," Economy Minister Jorge Remes Lenicov said last week before heading off to Washington to talk with I.M.F. officials. But neither side is willing to blink first. So the economy here, battered by a 50 percent devaluation of the peso, a freeze on bank deposits and a partial default on $141 billion in public debt, remains in a state of suspended animation. 
 Argentina argues that it has already taken a pair of steps that ought to be enough to win a resumption of credit, default or no default. The peso has been cut loose from a decade-long peg at one to the United States dollar and allowed to float -- it traded for about 49 cents today -- and President Eduardo Duhalde has submitted a budget for 2002 that sharply limits government spending.
But analysts say there is less to either measure than meets the eye. The budget is based on assumptions about tax revenue and growth, exchange rates and inflation that are considered unrealistic. And with so little cash in circulation because of the 11-week-old freeze on bank deposits, the government has found it easy to manipulate currency trading.
Argentina has not said much of anything about how it intends to solve a long list of other problems. These include recapitalizing a banking system that has absorbed billions of dollars in losses, amending a new bankruptcy law seen as discriminating against foreign companies, reducing the size of the state bureaucracy and curbing runaway spending by the provinces.
"It still seems that some things are in a fairly preliminary stage of discussion," said Joyce Chang, head of emerging-markets research at J. P. Morgan Securities. "They made some progress in Washington, outlining common objectives, but the fund still wants to see more of a strategy from Argentina, and Argentina still needs to do more."
The muted reaction of creditors has disappointed Argentine officials, who have repeatedly assured an anxious and angry citizenry that aid will soon be on the way. Before leaving for Washington, Mr. Remes told reporters here that he was disappointed that Argentina had not received "more resounding" support and praise for its initiatives.
"I think the Argentines felt there was nothing more they could do, and that the I.M.F. would recognize that," said Christian Stracke, a Latin America analyst at Commerzbank in New York. "They don't seem to recognize that the I.M.F. has been so seriously burned by Argentina in the past that it is determined to hold Argentina to a higher standard."
The fund cut off assistance to Argentina on Dec. 5. The government then in power fell two weeks later and failed to deliver on promises to cut spending sharply. Though Horst Kohler, the managing director of the fund, described the discussions last week as "very positive and cordial," other officials of the fund and officials of the United States government say that Argentina must still come up with a "sustainable plan" to reform the economy.
Speaking to the United States Chamber of Commerce in Washington on Thursday, Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill said he saw Argentina's problems as largely self-inflicted, born of borrowing too freely to finance consumption rather than investment. Though there have been steps in the right direction in recent weeks, he said, more must be done before new loans are warranted.
Argentine officials have said that they will need as much as $23 billion to get the economy moving again, and they clearly expect that the bulk of it will come from the fund. But a spokesman for the fund, Thomas Dawson, said that "it is certainly premature to be talking about numbers" and that "there are no packages on the table."
Since Mr. Remes's return, the government has gone back to the drawing board to tinker with its economic plan. But President Duhalde has stepped up a diplomatic campaign that seems intended to force the fund to relent on conditions for a new loan.
Argentine officials said they were heartened by the visit late last week of the German chancellor, Gerhard Schroder; they said he agreed to plead their case with Mr. Kohler, a fellow German. Mr. Schroder was said to favor a "step by step" plan that would give the Duhalde government some of the needed money early on but dole out the rest in stages based on Argentina's performance.
Argentina's neighbors have been especially outspoken. At a meeting here on Monday, the six countries of Mercosur, the South American common market, issued a joint statement that called on lending institutions to "understand Argentina's complex situation" and to agree to aid the country while it pursues "internal policies that will permit economic growth" rather than more austerity, as the fund is demanding.
"There is a better way to help Argentina," the president of Brazil, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, said at a news conference that was also attended by Mr. Duhalde and the presidents of Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay. "We don't believe that it is fair to ask Argentina to get things accomplished first and then to get the aid."

HEADLINE: Beliefs; 
An archdiocese a continent removed from scandal, and psychologically perhaps farther still.

BYLINE:  By Peter Steinfels 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
At this time of year, when you mention "the Congress" to many active Roman Catholics in this area, they don't think you are talking about anything in Washington. To them, "the Congress" is the Los Angeles Religious Education Congress, sponsored by the archdiocese.
 From Feb. 14 to 17, a total of 38,000 people, including 13,000 high school students, flooded the Anaheim Convention Center, across the street from Disneyland, to attend more than 200 talks, workshops, concerts, Masses and prayer services offered at the annual event. 
 The exhibition hall was a mosaic of American Catholicism. Publishers of major theological works and religion textbooks displayed their wares alongside booths purveying religious key chains, holy cards with the appropriate saint and prayer for each of life's trials, and tapes from someone called the Fun Nun. 
Speakers noted with wonder the sprawl and scope of the congress, the energy and seriousness of those attending, and the sheer diversity of expressions of faith. 
Yes, the shadow of the church's handling of sexual molestation cases involving priests in Boston and elsewhere showed itself in pained and angry remarks, and Cardinal Roger Mahony of Los Angeles referred to it briefly in his closing homily, applying the temptations Jesus faced in the desert to the church itself. 
But for now the tenor of Catholicism here seems quite distant psychologically from that in Boston.
Almost eight years ago, The New York Times began a series of articles on Catholicism in the United States with portraits of two parishes in the Los Angeles Archdiocese. 
One, St. Thomas the Apostle, made up largely of Central American immigrants, was in an area where the pastor often buried two young victims of gang violence a month -- but also baptized 100 infants of the young couples who jammed the solid old church building for Sunday Masses that were alive with the music of a mariachi band.
The other, St. Monica's, 20 miles away, in the affluent seaside municipality of Santa Monica, was famous for, among other things, a Sunday evening Mass with music and preaching that drew college-educated 20- and 30-something Catholics from all over the area. 
Return visits this week found both parishes still thriving, although their physical condition had been curiously reversed.
In 1994, St. Monica's was holding services in its gymnasium; the church itself was barricaded behind scaffolding, the structure split apart by the earthquake in January of that year.
Today the building stands more than restored. Frank Gehry, a Santa Monica resident, has designed an adjoining hospitality center that contributes to the outreach efforts that, along with good liturgies and preaching, are parish hallmarks. The pastor, Msgr. Lloyd Torgerson, former director of the Religious Education Congress, showed it off proudly. 
St. Thomas's church, on the other hand, is only now recovering from destruction. On June 12, 1999, a man who slept on the porch of the parish office and got meals from the parish food pantry decided he didn't like the service, so he set the church on fire. It was, explained the pastor, the Rev. Jarlath Cunnane, "a typical Saturday -- with the usual four weddings and a funeral." A tent was erected in the parking lot, and "we were ready to go by 5 p.m.," he said. 
Now, while the old church is repaired and enlarged, more than 5,000 parishioners worship each weekend in an unused factory building nearby. 
Gang violence went down in the late 1990's, Father Cunnane said, and economic conditions went up. But post-Sept. 11, he added, those immigrants who have arrived illegally face greater risks, and layoffs are hitting the hotels and restaurants where so many of his parishioners work. 
Both Monsignor Torgerson and Father Cunnane shook their heads over the sexual misconduct reports, however distant those scandals seemed from the bustle and urgency of their own daily ministering.
The subject is one that cannot be escaped. Cardinal Mahony has just issued a 2,500-word pastoral statement clearly responding to the anxieties of Catholics in his archdiocese. 
Reflecting on Jesus' image of a "good shepherd," the cardinal acknowledged that "in extreme cases," not only have some priests and other church workers "failed to protect the flock, they have acted as wolves." Sexual misconduct, especially toward minors, is "the most heinous betrayal," he wrote, "a grave evil and sin."
"Apologies are vitally necessary, but of themselves are insufficient," he continued, outlining the policies and procedures the archdiocese has had in place since 1988.
These include taking all accusations of sexual misconduct seriously and giving sympathetic attention, by a lay specialist, to complainants; reporting to civil authorities all complaints involving minors; and removing the accused from active ministry immediately, "pending the results of the investigations." 
Policies also include educating priests and lay people alike about sexual abuse, carefully screening new candidates for the priesthood, and monitoring and guiding them during their training. 
The archdiocese plans to publish in its newspaper the full policies, as well as simple question-and-answer guidelines for responding to cases of sexual misconduct. The cardinal is said to have also put religious orders, whose internal decisions about personnel he does not directly control, on notice that they, too, must have their houses in order. 
"No human plan can possibly foresee all eventualities," he noted. This is, after all, earthquake territory. But the remarkable new Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels being completed here is built to cope with tremendous shocks. So, too, are the restored churches of St. Monica and St. Thomas the Apostle. 
Cardinal Mahony clearly believes that the apparent vitality of Catholicism here depends upon the faithful's confidence that regarding sexual misconduct, similar safeguards have been put in place.

HEADLINE: Muslim Group Starts an Effort To Increase Voter Registration 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 22 

 BODY:
The Council on American-Islamic Relations began a nationwide voter drive today, seeking to register more than 100,000 Muslim voters before the November elections.
 The effort started on the festival of Id al-Adha, which comes at the end of the annual hajj, or pilgrimage to Mecca. Here in Washington, the council offered registration forms and voter guides to the thousands of Muslims gathered for prayers and a bazaar at the District of Columbia Armory. Registration drives also took place at festivals in California, Michigan, Missouri and Ohio, council officials said. 
 Nihad Awad, the executive director of the council, which is an advocacy group here, said he wanted to encourage voting so that the size of the country's Muslim population -- which his group puts at roughly seven million, but others much lower -- would begin to translate into political power.
"Voting used to be an option," Mr. Awad said. "Now it is a must. Since Sept. 11, Muslim people feel disenfranchised. They feel they do not get the same political attention as other minorities."
Although a survey by the council in August found that three-quarters of the Muslims eligible to vote were registered, council officials say they would like to increase that proportion.
In the council booth at the festival here, volunteers provided directories that listed telephone numbers for members of Congress, other federal agencies, political parties and news organizations. They also distributed pocket-sized guides with instructions on how to write a letter to a newspaper editor, what to do if the Federal Bureau of Investigation requests an interview, how to react to "anti-Muslim hate crimes" and what to do if faced with discrimination at work or on an airplane.
An introduction to the voter guide says: "Muslims in America share a set of common values and interests that they should support and make known to others. By backing candidates that share our interests and concerns, you can help improve the moral, social and economic environment of this great land."
In Los Angeles, voter registration efforts at about a dozen Id al-Adha celebrations attracted "dozens and dozens of people," said Hussam Ayloush, the executive director of the Southern California chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. 
"The events of the last few months," Mr. Ayloush said, "have made people feel the importance of being politically active."
Since the government's investigation into the September attacks began, hundreds of Middle Eastern immigrants have been detained on charges of immigration violations. Legislation approved shortly after the attacks gives Attorney General John Ashcroft latitude in indefinitely detaining foreigners who are deemed security threats. 
Some immigration lawyers have said that this has led to an increase in naturalization requests by Arab and other Muslim immigrants.
Salman Shafique, 49, a computer engineer from Fairfax, Va., said he had been questioned and searched at airports several times since Sept. 11.
"By voting, you get a say in how policy is formed, a voice," Mr. Shafique said after he filled out a registration form.
Ibrahim Hooper, a spokesman for the council, said: "Power goes to those who show up. We need Muslims to show up. We don't care if they vote for dogcatcher, as long as they vote."

HEADLINE: Capturing for Generations the Agony of a Single Day 

BYLINE:  By BARBARA STEWART 

 BODY:
Someday, when the toddlers of today are elderly, a teenager may visit a museum, gaze at a dirt-encrusted briefcase found near ground zero and, for the first time, feel chilled by the reality of Sept. 11, 2001.
 Perhaps a crushed fire truck door will make the suffering vivid to future museumgoers. Or posters with photographs of the missing. 
 Already, people seem eager to learn more about the attacks and their aftermath. Last fall a photography show about Sept. 11 at the New-York Historical Society and an exhibition on New York's skyline at the Museum of the City of New York attracted unusually large crowds. New exhibitions have just opened at each institution: "Brotherhood," about firefighters, at the museum, and "WTC: Monument," at the society. 
There will be many more. Shows on every imaginable aspect of Sept. 11 are planned at museums in New York, Washington, Chicago, Dallas and elsewhere. A memorial is to be built at the World Trade Center site. And military museums and the National Museum of American History of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington are acquiring artifacts for permanent collections. 
"We've managed to forget so many public traumas," said Mike Wallace, author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning "Gotham: A History of the City to 1898." "The draft riots, great fires and great epidemics. Remembering and forgetting are complex. But this event will be remembered because of the data. Pity the poor historian who has to wade through all this stuff. The fire of 1935 -- fortunately, there's far less stuff."
There seem to be two approaches: the official one, to save as much as possible and figure out later what is worth keeping; and the one taken by private museums, to choose a few things with care and hope the decisions hold up a century or two later. 
"You can't tell what will bring the event to life," Dr. Wallace said. "What questions the people of the future will be asking."
Who would have guessed that a schoolboy's scorched lunchbox, found in the rubble of Hiroshima after the dropping of the atom bomb, would be the relic that embodies the horror for museum visitors there? 
"It shows the innocence of life passing through the city," said Jan Ramirez, a curator at the Historical Society. "And the total surprise. That's the sort of thing curators are looking for."
The search is delicate. Curators are reluctant to seem insensitive by asking for memorabilia. None have called victim's families or fire stations directly. They worry, for instance, that exhibitions of photos on posters of the missing could hurt victims' relatives, said Josh Brown, who leads Columbia University's American Social History Project, which is trying to compile all e-mail messages sent from the World Trade Center on Sept. 11.
"It's a hard question," said Kenneth Jackson, president of the Historical Society, which has 10 Sept. 11 exhibitions planned through 2003. "What is the proper moment for a historian to intervene? I worry that we waited too long. Part of me felt: 'Don't be ghoulish. Don't be picking over the bones. It's still smoking down there. The bodies haven't been recovered.' "
"But a big part of the World Trade Center is lost," he added. "All those messages at fire stations -- everywhere, you saw thank you's and God bless you's -- the rain and weather destroyed most of them."
"I worry that, respecting the loss, we failed in our duty as historians: to preserve and not worry about your own feelings or anyone else's," he said. "To tell the story of New York and preserve something for researchers long after our grandchildren are dead."
So vast and unwieldy was the task that a consortium of some 30 museums met in New York last October to develop a strategy. "We didn't want to get into arguments about who gets what," said James Gardner, a curator at the National Museum of American History.
But as a crime scene and graveyard, ground zero was off-limits to all collectors except for Voorsanger & Mills, an architectural firm hired by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to set aside artifacts for a memorial. At the Pentagon, only selected military curators were allowed inside. For now, the City of New York is keeping the shrine objects from Union Square and Washington Square: messages, photos and so forth. And the memorials at fire stations and on the streets were left undisturbed because they were still comforting New Yorkers. 
The Voorsanger architects initially concentrated solely on large, striking architectural materials. But after talking with the curators, they also began saving modest, everyday things. "A crushed filing cabinet, a coffee mug -- things that seem like another piece of garbage -- are the kind of things museums can use to tell stories," said Sarah Henry, a curator at the Museum of the City of New York.
Such things were found at the Pentagon. But at ground zero, office equipment was crushed to dust. No filing cabinets or melted clocks survive. All that remains of thousands of ergonomic office chairs are tiny metal wheels from the bases. 
Hundreds of battered fire trucks and taxis, however, were hauled to Fresh Kills, the former municipal landfill on Staten Island, where ground zero rubble has been dumped. "Trucks flattened like pancakes and wheels seared and opened like the inside of seed pods," Ms. Ramirez said after a recent visit. "We're a long way from art history." 
Not many museums can find room for a fire truck. But several are hoping for a truck door with a fire company logo, many of which were removed as station souvenirs. 
There are cartloads of donated teddy bears, crates of origami cranes from Japanese schoolchildren, hundreds of thousands of letters, poems and drawings from well-wishers everywhere, as well as clothing and favorite childhood toys that might be given by the families of victims. Museums in some cities, like the Chicago Historical Museum, are collecting their residents' writings and artwork about the disaster. Elsewhere, towns and schools are contributing them to the Smithsonian Institution or to City Hall or museums in New York.
"Every school group and church thinks their offerings are unique," said David H. Shayt, a curator at the National Museum of American History. 
It is far too much, Ms. Ramirez said. "One pretzel-like ladder and one gnarled door is enough," she said. A child's letter might be poignant, she added. Dozens would be numbing and expensive to keep. 
What Mr. Shayt is looking for are a few items with compelling stories, like the squeegee handle that a window washer trapped in an elevator in the North Tower used to escape. And that dirt-encrusted briefcase, which Lisa Leffler, an insurance broker at AON Risk Services Inc., left on her desk when she fled and which was found blocks away and returned to her by a rescue worker.
Though people tend to focus on individual stories of grief and heroism, museums look more deeply, putting the attacks in historical context and interpreting the complicated surrounding layers of economics, politics and religion and of foreign and military relations. 
"I'm concerned," Dr. Wallace said, "that too much attention is being paid to the shards of buildings and victims' stuff. That's not going to answer certain kinds of questions: not the how but the why. Was it New York or Wall Street? New York, don't forget, has been cordially loathed and despised by all and sundry for most of our history." 
"It's tempting," he added, "to say that this massive roundup of objects is overkill. I suspect we're doing this as much for ourselves, to come to terms with it. There's a sense that things will serve as markers, and it's a human thing not to want to let the moment fade."

CORRECTION-DATE: March 5, 2002

 CORRECTION:
A credit listing on Feb. 22 with an article in the "Watching Movies With . . ." series, in which Nicole Kidman discussed "The Shining," misstated the film's producer credit. Stanley Kubrick was its sole producer; Robert Fryer was not a producer.
An article in Arts & Ideas on Feb. 23 about artifacts of Sept. 11 sought by museums misstated the affiliation of Joshua Brown, who spoke of the delicacy of the search. He is executive director of the American social history project at the Graduate Center of City University of New York, not at Columbia University.
The article also misstated the title of Sarah Henry at the Museum of the City of New York and the name of the architecture firm hired by the Port Authority to set aside artifacts. Ms. Henry is vice president for programs, not a curator. The firm is Voorsanger & Associates Architects PC; its name was Voorsanger & Mills until 1990.
The article also misstated the date of a fire discussed by a historian. It was 1835, not 1935.

HEADLINE: U.S. and China Stay Positive, but Make Little Progress 

BYLINE:  By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Feb. 22 

 BODY:
President Bush left for home today after lecturing the Chinese people on the merits of liberty and religious faith and taking more than one opportunity to remind them that the United States is pledged to aid Taiwan's defense.
 He did not waver on American plans to build missile defenses, and he urged China to halt exports of missile technology. He predicted the triumph of democracy in this Communist country. 
 China's leaders could hardly have seemed more pleased. 
An official assessment of the 30-hour "working visit," issued tonight by the New China News Agency, described it as a "historic moment" and said the two countries "have begun a new stage of developing constructive relations of cooperation in the new century." 
"The meeting between President Jiang Zemin and Bush was rich in content and has drawn world attention," said the analysis from the agency, the voice of the Communist Party's propaganda department.
"Rich in content" seemed a stretch: though the meetings were replete with cordial toasts and mutual expressions of respect and hope, no major diplomatic agreements were reached. Despite years of talks and an obvious link to the shared interest in the war on terror, the two countries even failed to agree on precise rules to end Chinese missile aid to Pakistan and Iran.
Yet both Washington and Beijing clearly feel it is in their interest to emphasize the positive. "Both sides seem to have concluded that it doesn't make sense, at least for now, to pick a fight with each other," said Bates Gill, a China expert at the Brookings Institution in Washington.
The leaders did not paper over the differences on crucial issues like Taiwan, weapons sales and human rights. During the gracious exchanges, both stuck to their positions with carefully considered words. But each side seemed content to describe these basic issues -- potential sources of future shocks -- as part of the normal give-and-take of great nations.
For China, it helped that Mr. Bush's implied criticisms, even the condescension inherent in his televised paeans to the American way, were coated in so much sugar that they were easy to swallow. 
In his public appearances, Mr. Bush pushed all the right buttons, marveling at what he called China's "amazing progress" since he was here in 1975 and describing Beijing's successful bid to play host to the 2008 Olympics as a wonderful chance for China to show its best face.
"The Wall's the same, different country," he quipped as he hiked on the Great Wall this afternoon, greeted by schoolchildren who waved Chinese and American flags and sang "Edelweiss" in English.
The Chinese are obsessed with building their economy and with keeping social stability as they open markets to global competition. At a psychological level, China's leaders and people seek respect for their country as a power that is claiming its place in the world after centuries of divisions and colonial oppression. So even as routine a thing as American endorsement of further summit meetings is seen as a triumph.
"For China, the most satisfying outcome this week was the invitations for Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao to visit the United States," said Chu Shulong, an expert on foreign policy and American politics at Qinghua University. Mr. Jiang is to visit Washington in the fall, shortly before he is expected to step down as Communist Party leader and president while Mr. Hu, the vice president and heir apparent, is to visit in the coming months.
Along with the friendly gestures were many signs of the deep differences that remain and that could explode into bitter conflict.
The two leaders used pointedly different language to describe the Taiwan issue. Mr. Jiang said he was pleased that Mr. Bush, in their private meeting, had endorsed the one-China principle. Mr. Jiang extolled prior bilateral agreements over Taiwan's status. 
Mr. Bush spoke repeatedly of American support for a "peaceful settlement" in Taiwan, not saying that "reunification" had to be the outcome. He spoke of the Taiwan Relations Act -- an American law that permits arms sales to help Taiwan defend itself.
American officials had hoped to reach an agreement to end Chinese exports of missile technology, which in recent years have involved mainly Pakistan and Iran. But White House officials said that the issues had not yet been resolved and that discussions would continue. No one has publicly explained what went wrong.
In November 2000, Chinese and American officials reached agreement that China would halt such exports. The United States, in turn, was to allow American satellite companies to hire Chinese missiles for launching, a practice that had been suspended out of security concerns. 
American officials say China has failed to issue the required export-control regulations and list of sensitive items and that, in violation of an oral commitment, it has not ended technology transfers that had begun before November 2000.
China says that it has stuck by its word and that it is waiting for the United States to authorize the commercial satellite launches. 
American officials have often described weapons proliferation as a central concern, but if they were disappointed by the slow progress this week, they were not speaking out harshly about it.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE ALLIES; 
Europe Seethes as the U.S. Flies Solo in World Affairs

BYLINE:  By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Feb. 21 

 BODY:
Europe's unconditional solidarity with the Bush administration, declared so quickly in the shock after the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington, has faded almost as suddenly.
 In public pronouncements and interviews, America's European allies are seething over what they see as a renewed American impulse to disregard them and go it alone as the Bush administration considers expanding its war on terrorism to Iraq. 
 The Sept. 11 attacks gave President Bush a defining cause and the wind of virtue, and both the European Union and the NATO alliance lined up solidly behind the United States.
But the Europeans thought that Washington's work to build a vast international coalition against terrorism meant a new willingness to work more closely with allies, in particular, to pay more heed to the Europeans themselves.
"But more and more of us now think we were wrong," a senior European official said. "That feeds some of the bitterness." 
In Washington, a senior American official said: "It's pretty bad right now. It's a negative environment. The Europeans think that the United States is so powerful it can't be constrained."
Senior European officials are now trying to take the sting out of the bitter spat with Washington over Mr. Bush's formulation of an "axis of evil." But the new diplomatic politesse is merely a tea towel covering a serious dispute over American foreign policy that was suppressed by the international solidarity after Sept. 11.
Behind the heated accusations of unilateralism, arrogance, bad manners and oversimplification lie cultural and ideological differences made wider by the Afghan war and more vivid by the prospect of a new war in Iraq.
Mr. Bush, awake to new dangers, wants to change the world, American officials say; Europe, preoccupied with its own growing pains in a deepening and expanding union, wants to continue to manage it.
The Europeans, moreover, are not convinced that military means are the best way of doing either, and they complain that their offers of military aid were in any case largely spurned, and not always graciously. 
They are trying, as best as they can, to influence Washington's debate, especially about Iraq, depending greatly on Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, the former general who helped build the coalition against terrorism, but whose moderating views, the Europeans fear, are being pushed aside.
In particular, the American proposal to build on the Afghan war and move to a new doctrine of pre-emption -- military action against Iraq, for example, justified by its potential danger alone -- has fueled European accusations that America is willing to ignore its best allies and even international law to defend its own global interests.
"Before Sept. 11, the U.S. and Europe were slowly drifting apart, but now it looks like they're on a collision course," said Ivo Daalder, a Dutch-born former Clinton administration official now with the Brookings Institution.
"While many hoped that U.S. foreign policy would be more to Europe's liking," Mr. Daalder said, "Washington has been even more unilateralist than before, more insistent on having its way and more dismissive of the perspectives of others -- whether it is on rebuilding Afghanistan, addressing underlying causes of terrorism, or broadening the scope of the war on terrorism."
Javier Solana, the European Union's foreign policy chief, is asking both sides to behave like adults, for which he was thanked in a telephone call by Secretary Powell. "This relationship is too serious to play with, for us and for you," Mr. Solana said in an interview. "We have to maintain the sense of maturity on both sides."
But the Europeans themselves, after the successful introduction of a new European currency, the euro, are feeling more assertive, and with hard-fought elections this year in two of the largest European countries, France and Germany, left-wing politicians like the French foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine, and the German foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, have been beefing up their base with attacks on Mr. Bush and his remarks about an "axis of evil."
The criticism cannot be dismissed as mere politics, European and American officials say. On Wednesday, a discussion on German television featured sharp criticism of American foreign policy across the German political spectrum.
"Solidarity no longer seems unconditional," a participant in the program noted. Even the German president, Johannes Rau, who is supposed to be above politics, warned Americans that international success depended on alliances.
"The success of future actions, both economically and politically, will not lie in isolation or policies of lonely decision-making," Mr. Rau said. "Especially when it comes to the use of military means, there has to be acceptance worldwide for it to be of lasting success. Partners have to be ready to speak with each other and listen to each other -- but then to act jointly."
European officials now sense that they must shout in order to be heard in a warlike, messianic Washington, and even then, wonder if it matters, and now think the shouting is counterproductive, particularly if it undermines Secretary Powell.
Culturally, too, the Europeans see their influence in the world as a product of their united voice. The instrument for that unity is the European Union, a model of shared and devolved sovereignty that is built on multilateralism and compromise.
Europe is a regional power with global ambitions, but those ambitions have more to do with civilian power, aid and trade, than military might. Only the United States sees its national interests at risk from Tokyo to Banff, giving Washington a different set of priorities -- and the desire and need for a much bigger, more mobile and sophisticated military.
Christopher Patten, the European Union commissioner for foreign policy, is sticking to his words. He had warned Washington about the dangers of "unilateralist overdrive" in the fight against terrorism and of abandoning constructive engagement with Iran and North Korea.
"I'm a real friend of America who doesn't happen to confuse friendship with sycophancy," he said in an interview.
Americans get annoyed when Europeans sound "hand-wringing and sententious and patronizing," he said. "And we get cross when we think America is throwing its weight around."
Part of the problem, Mr. Patten acknowledges, is that America's military weight dwarfs that of the rest of the world, and it is growing heavier, with Mr. Bush proposing a $48 billion increase in the Pentagon's budget that is a third greater than the total military budget of Britain, NATO's second-largest military spender.
Afghanistan was relatively easy. But the European-American alliance "is coming to some very difficult choices," Mr. Patten said. "Managing our relationship is going to require thought and care."
Asked if he felt he truly understood the change in the American psyche after Sept. 11, Mr. Patten paused, then said, "Even those of us who've subsequently been to New York and know America well and have vast sympathy for New York and for America after what's happened, I don't think quite get it."
"I don't think we fully comprehend the impact of a grand innocence and a sense of magnificent self-confidence and invulnerability being shattered in that appalling way," he added." I think that's a perfectly legitimate criticism to make of us."
He recognized, he said, that the Bush administration had found a cause. "And when you're fighting a big cause," he said, " 'yes but' isn't necessarily the clarion call that people want to hear."
Still, he said, serious issues of alliance politics and international law were at stake, and sheer logic.
Iraq, Iran and North Korea are not an axis, he said, and they are not the world's only weapons proliferators. 
Why, Mr. Patten asks, is constructive engagement to produce better behavior a good idea in China and Russia (both of them serious proliferators of dangerous technologies) but a bad idea in Iran? "I can't understand why people think we should give up on the reformers now," he said.
Why not make a stronger effort with the Russians to get weapons inspectors back into Iraq? he asked. Why not acknowledge foreign aid and nation-building as important tools in the fight against terrorism?
Most important, the United States has permanent friends and allies who need to be heard, he said. 
Mr. Patten, in a literary way, gave a gentle warning about the hubris of empire. He recalled Kipling's "Recessional," with the line "lest we forget," which is used every year to remember the dead. But people forget the context, he said. Then he quoted from the poem:
Far-called our navies melt away; 
On dune and headland sinks the fire:
Lo, all our pomp of yesterday
Is one with Nineveh and Tyre!
Judge of the Nations, spare us yet,
Lest we forget, lest we forget.
Kipling wrote the poem at the height of British imperial power, Mr. Patten noted. "It was a warning that was not, alas, heeded."

HEADLINE: Mayor Says City Can't Afford Higher Raises for the Police 

BYLINE:  By AL BAKER 

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said yesterday that the city would have a "tough time" giving police officers raises larger than those proposed by the previous administration, even if a state arbitration panel were to rule that a larger-than-budgeted salary increase was warranted.
 On his weekly radio show, Mayor Bloomberg laid out his rationale on why the city, which faces a $4.76 billion budget deficit, would be hard pressed to pay police officers more than the amount currently planned: a roughly 10 percent salary increase over the next two years. 
 Police officers received no raises in the first two years of their last contract, which was for 63 months and expired on July 31, 2000. The mayor noted that the police "settled for no raises" during times that were economically booming. 
On point after point during his radio show, the mayor made note of arguments that have been made in the past as to why officers should receive large raises and pointedly deflated them. Referring to the fact that Nassau County police officers are paid considerably more than officers in New York City -- which has prompted calls for raises in the city -- he noted that the county was "fundamentally bankrupt."
"The city does not have any extra money, we all know that," said the mayor, who made his comments on WABC. "Right now, the city economy is declining, not growing, and we're going to have a tough time coming up with anything more if the arbitration panel rules that."
The city is at impasse in negotiations with the 25,000-member Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, said Robert W. Linn, the union's chief negotiator. The city is scheduled to begin legally binding arbitration hearings on March 18, before a state appointed three-member panel that is headed by Dana E. Eischen, an arbitrator from Ithaca, N.Y., Mr. Linn said.
The mayor's comments, his first substantive public comments on the police salary issue since his budget address last week, seemed to foreshadow what the city's argument would be in front of that arbitration panel. A decision, which will serve as the new contract, is expected by June, Mr. Linn said.
"By any standard, whether looking at nearby municipalities or national cities, New York City police officers are woefully underpaid," Mr. Linn said. "And we believe we will present a compelling case that will persuade Chairman Eischen that the city must provide a market adjustment to provide competitive salaries."
Asked how the city would manage fiscally if the arbitration panel ruled that it must pay more to its police officers than what was budgeted, Edward Skyler, the mayor's chief spokesman, reiterated the mayor's comments. "The mayor will support our police officers in any way he can," Mr. Skyler said. "But the fact is that the city is facing a $5 billion budget deficit and the current offer is all we can afford."
The current entry-level base salary for city police officers is $31,305 a year, not including differentials for working at night or holiday pay. In contrast to many other cities, the pay for New York City officers does not jump substantially until after the fifth year of service, when it increases to $49,023, Mr. Linn said.
Police union officials have long said that low pay is the prime reason for a recent exodus of officers. In a statement, Patrick J. Lynch, the union president, said: "Mayor Bloomberg must realize that any offer that shortchanges New York City police officers will not, in the long run, be a cost-effective policy. It will only intensify the recruitment and retention crisis. You need a well-paid, professional police force to continue the historic crime reductions and quality-of-life improvements, and to be successful in the domestic war against terrorism."
The mayor said the city should stay tuned. "Will they get more out of Albany or less?" the mayor asked, referring to the arbitration panel. "The city thinks less, the P.B.A. thinks more. We'll find out how that plays itself out."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: JOURNALISTS; 
Suspect Says Reporter Was Slain In January as Part of Wider Plot

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Feb. 22 

 BODY:
The chief suspect in the Daniel Pearl case has told investigators that the captive Wall Street Journal reporter was killed in late January as part of a plot that was to have included an attack on the United States Consulate in Karachi, intelligence and law enforcement officials said today.
 The claims by the suspect, Ahmed Omar Sheikh, a British-born militant now in Pakistani custody, are among the clues being weighed by the American and Pakistani authorities still pursuing others thought to have been involved in the killing, a gruesome beheading recorded on a three-minute, 50-second digital videotape made available to American investigators in Karachi late on Thursday. 
 Intelligence and law enforcement officials who have viewed the tape said it showed Mr. Pearl, full face and in conversation until the hands of unknown assailants intruded into the picture to pull his head back by the hair and to slit his throat. Later in the tape, Mr. Pearl's dismembered head was shown, said the officials, who spoke on condition that their nationalities not be specified. 
Mr. Pearl's wife, Mariane, who is seven months pregnant, issued a statement saying that her husband's killers could not defeat his spirit and that she would tell their son that his father had worked to end terrorism. "I promise you that the terrorists did not defeat my husband no matter what they did to him, nor did they succeed in seizing his dignity or value as a human being," she said.
The claims by Mr. Sheikh, 28, about the timing of Mr. Pearl's death and a parallel plot to attack the American Consulate in Karachi have not been corroborated, the intelligence and law enforcement officials said. 
The tape of Mr. Pearl, made on a digital video camera, is suspected of being part of a longer recording that may be stored on a compact disc, with images and audio recordings of Mr. Pearl in captivity, the officials said. 
The videotape was given to representatives of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Karachi on Thursday by a Pakistani journalist who covers Islamic militants and had earlier received word that such a disc might be made available to him. 
The journalist had informed the F.B.I. of that communication. But in what some officials described as a possible blunder, the officials said no effort had been made to keep track of the informer, making it impossible to trace whoever provided the tape.
Today, as American officials here praised Pakistan for its aggressive pursuit of Mr. Pearl's killers, President Pervez Musharraf vowed that the killing would not deter him and his government "from acting with all their strength against terrorists and in fighting this menace together with the international community," a government statement said.
The American ambassador to Pakistan, Wendy Chamberlin, said in an interview that the prospect that at least one of the suspects in the killing might at some point be handed over to the United States would be among "the kinds of issues to be resolved as we proceed in the case."
Until Mr. Pearl's death was confirmed, Pakistani officials were reluctant to consider such a possibility. But today, senior Pakistani officials said the fact of the killing had made it increasingly likely that they might at some point agree to a handover. 
American and Pakistani officials have been working closely together in the case, and Ms. Chamberlin said the partnership had yielded "about as good law enforcement to law enforcement cooperation as I've seen anywhere in the world, on this case and in other terrorist-related cases, related to Al Qaeda." 
Still, the police in Karachi and across Pakistan were apparently unsuccessful in their efforts to find Mr. Pearl's body, and there was no immediate sign that the videotape of the killing provided clues that might lead to the capture of other suspects.
In providing an account of Mr. Sheikh's statements while in custody, law enforcement and intelligence officials said he had been aggressive, unapologetic and taunting.
"Now, that would have been spectacular, wouldn't it!" the officials quoted him as saying of the reported plot against the consulate. They said Mr. Sheikh had told his American and Pakistani interrogators that his only regret was that he had not been able to carry out that attack.
Another suspect who is being held in the case, Fahad Naseem, said before a Karachi magistrate on Thursday that Mr. Sheikh told him two days before the kidnapping that he was going to seize someone who is "anti-Islam and a Jew."
An official close to the investigation told The Associated Press that the video showed Mr. Pearl saying into the camera, "I am a Jew, my mother is a Jew."
The videotape contained no clues about when the killing of Mr. Pearl took place, the officials said. But they said its gruesome images seemed to match what Mr. Sheikh had told investigators about a conversation he said took place eight days after Mr. Pearl was kidnapped in Karachi, on Jan. 23.
"When I contacted my associates from Lahore on Feb. 1, they said: 'Dad is already dead. We have done the scan and completed the X-rays and post-mortem,' " the officials quoted Mr. Sheikh as having told interrogators, using a code name for Mr. Pearl. The officials said they now interpreted the references to the scan and X-rays as a reference to filming the event and post-mortem as a suggestion that the body had been disposed of.
Mr. Sheikh left Karachi on Jan. 28, which could put the date of killing at between Jan. 29 and Jan. 31, the officials said.
Between Feb. 1 and Feb. 12, when he surrendered to the authorities in Lahore, Mr. Sheikh pretended to negotiate with intelligence officials who were acting as intermediaries, a tactic that Pakistani officials now interpret as a ruse aimed at allowing his accomplices to wipe out their tracks.
"The case has now become even harder to crack," a Pakistani intelligence official said today. While three other suspects besides Mr. Sheikh are now in Pakistani custody, the official said investigators were exploring at least a half-dozen other possible links to the kidnapping. 
Ambassador Chamberlin returned to Pakistan only this morning from Washington, where she helped to coordinate General Musharraf's visit earlier this month. She described the investigation as "going at full throttle," but would say of Mr. Sheikh's role only that "he certainly seems to be involved, but I think a full characterization of this hidden plot will only be revealed at the conclusion."
The ambassador said President Bush spoke by telephone today with General Musharraf, who offered his condolences for Mr. Pearl's death.
Mr. Sheikh, who attended the London School of Economics, is thought to be a leader of Jaish-e-Muhammad, or Army of Muhammad, a militant Islamic group that General Musharraf banned last month, as part of his crackdown on extremist groups. Mr. Sheikh spent five years in an Indian prison, on charges linked to the 1994 kidnapping of Westerners, and was freed into Afghanistan in a 1999 hostage-prisoner swap. 
Officials familiar with Mr. Sheikh's interrogation said he had seemed unafraid of the consequences of his action. At one point, they said, he told F.B.I. officials in perfect English that he cared only as much for Mr. Pearl's pregnant wife, Mariane, as the Americans had cared for their pregnant victims in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Mr. Sheikh has been the focus of discussions between Pakistani and American officials about a possible extradition, officials of both governments say. Such a step would require not only that Pakistan agree, but also that he first be indicted in the United States; American officials say an indictment is already being weighed.
Pakistani officials have said they would weigh a request for extradition against all factors, including the possibility of domestic repercussion from Islamic groups that have already accused General Musharraf's government of acting as a tool of the United States. The officials say they do not expect the United States to make such a request unless both sides have first privately agreed that an extradition would advance the cause of the investigation.
Representatives of many Islamic groups in Pakistan joined today in expressing horror at Mr. Pearl's killing. Hamida Khuhro, a top official of the Pakistan Muslim League, which until General Musharraf took power was Pakistan's largest political party, issued a statement saying, "we are bowed down in shame."
"This can only be the work of those who are determined to bring both Pakistan and Islam into disrepute and provide ammunition to those who wish us ill," Dr. Khuhro said.
Officials of Jaish-e-Muhammad and other banned groups have denied any involvement in the killing, and a spokesman for another radical Islamic party, Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam, today condemned what it called "this brutal killing of an innocent man."
But a spokesman for that party, which is not among those that General Musharraf banned, was quoted by Agence France-Press as putting blame for the killing on Washington's support of Israel against the Palestinians and the deaths of innocent people in Afghanistan.

HEADLINE: The Mystery of Computers, a Bicycle for Two, and the Tango Lesson

BYLINE: These sketches were written by Tara Bahrampour, Michael Brick, Constance L. Hays, Lynette Holloway, Kirk Johnson, Tina Kelley, N. R. Kleinfield, Dylan Loeb McClain, Iver Peterson and Barbara Whitaker.

 BODY:
Here are glimpses of some of the victims of the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center.

WILLIAM R. BETHKE
Connoisseur of Technology
 Computers were not just tools for work to William R. Bethke. There was a logic, an internal magic and mystery that drew him to understand their hummings and beepings. His house in Hamilton, N.J., resembled an elephant's graveyard for computers. Wires, cables and circuit boards filled his workshop-office and spilled into the basement, some machines partly disassembled, others lovingly rebuilt from spare parts.
 ''If somebody had an old computer, they would automatically think of Bill; if someone needed a new computer, he would refurbish one and give it to them,'' said Mr. Bethke's wife, Valerie. ''He liked everything that was technical and complex.''
 Mr. Bethke, 36, followed his nose for technology pretty much right out of high school, landing a job first at I.B.M., which sent him to school and taught him to diagnose the ailments of sick machines, and later at Marsh & McLennan's computer processing department at the World Trade Center. He liked to shoot pistols at a gun range with his friend and next-door neighbor, David Koprivich, perhaps from the same impulse -- an appreciation of finely tuned mechanical performance.
 He was never quite able to communicate the love of technology to his wife, but Ms. Bethke said she got used to it: ''I'd just say, 'O.K., honey.' ''

GREGORY E. RODRIGUEZ
Explorer of Wrecks
 Not everyone would get up at 4:30 in the morning to look at wrecks, but Gregory E. Rodriguez did just that. The wrecks, as it happened, were shipwrecks. He would head out to Brooklyn or Long Island, shrug into scuba diving gear and, with others, explore long-sunken ships. This was wreck diving, and he adored it. He even kept a framed map in his office of where the wrecks were.
 The diving made his wife, Elizabeth Soudant, a little nervous. He used to have to call her when he got to Brooklyn, then after the first dive, after the second dive, and when he was leaving. Of course, that meant she had to stay home, chained to the phone. After a while, she calmed down. He had to call only when he got there and when he was leaving.
 Mr. Rodriguez, 31, an assistant vice president for information security at the eSpeed division of Cantor Fitzgerald, lived with his wife in White Plains. He always brought a smile to her face with his wit and good humor, she said. 
 Last Labor Day weekend, they went to Seattle, and Mr. Rodriguez went scuba diving with Ms. Soudant's brother-in-law. Afterward, Mr. Rodriguez said it was his best dive. He didn't see any wrecks, but he saw some wolf eels -- fierce-looking things that resembled old men -- and they fascinated him. Her brother-in-law intends to go to the spot where they dived, she said, and put a plaque with Mr. Rodriguez's name on it beneath the water.

RONALD TARTARO
In Tandem
 It is not every man you would want to share a tandem bicycle with. The front and rear riders have to be in tune, with no battles of the will, no bullying. The person in front, usually the man, steers, sets the pace, makes the decisions. ''You do have to be exactly in sync,'' said Karen Reilly, who rode behind her husband, Ronald Tartaro. 
 They climbed and coasted well together. Not that he was predictable, she said, but he was logical and reasonable. ''He always did the thing that made the most sense,'' she said.
 The couple worked hard to get their children -- two girls, ages 7 and 5, and a boy, 3 -- out bicycling. When there were just two girls, the parents would tow them in a trailer behind the tandem bike. After their son arrived, he took his place in the trailer, and the oldest girl rode in a one-wheeled bicycle attached to Ms. Reilly's.
 Mr. Tartaro, 38, an executive vice president at Fred Alger Management, harbored big dreams of wider-ranging travel. ''He wanted to buy a boat and sail around the world,'' with family and friends joining in for different legs of the trip, his wife said. ''He had it practically funded, not that we were going to do it anytime soon.''

THOMAS DUFFY
Refuge in the Mountains
 When Thomas Duffy and Ray Cower were in ninth grade, they won third prize for a model they made, a coffee can attached to a drill that flung moisture from a wet rag inside. Was it centripetal or centrifugal force? Mr. Cower has forgotten. But both forces worked on the friends, who met in first or second grade, played school sports together in Oneonta, N.Y., and were transferred numerous places through their jobs, often not far from each other. 
 Mr. Duffy, 52, lived in Pittsford, N.Y., and was a senior vice president at Marsh & McLennan. He found special solace at the family's camp on Little Long Lake in the Adirondacks, said Cyndy Duffy, his wife of 30 years. ''With our moving so much, and not really being able to settle down and say this is home for good, camp was always there,'' she said. ''It was always the one place that never changed.''
 They had two sons, Jason, 26, and Ryan, 19, whom he coached in a variety of sports. ''He always had his own way of letting you know if he was proud of you,'' Ryan Duffy said, ''just by being there.'' Jason has a son, Dylan, who is almost 2. Mr. Duffy was teaching him how to shoot baskets. ''He was really looking forward to taking him up to camp in the summer, and teaching him how to swim,'' Mrs. Duffy said.

CHANTAL VINCELLI
A Thing About Cats
 ''She had this thing with cats; she'd pick up stray cats and she'd bring them home, and she'd make them into house pets,'' Daryl DiMiceli said about his friend Chantal Vincelli. ''She'd keep them in the bathroom until they got used to her, and then take them out to meet the other cats. She'd kind of rotate them through.'' 
 Ms. Vincelli, 38, was at the World Trade Center setting up for a trade show for DataSynapse Inc., where she was director of member services. But there were two jobs she dreamed about, another friend, Barry Lamm, recalled: personal assistant for Bill Clinton, and talk-show host.
 Mr. Lamm spent New Year's Eve 1999 with Ms. Vincelli in her native Montreal. ''Everyone was screaming 'Happy New Year,' but she carried around a big apple that read 'Happy New Year, Times Square. We love you!' '' 
 After Sept. 11, Ms. Vincelli's friends found homes for the 17 cats found in her Harlem apartment.

PAUL RUBACK
He Wanted Some Peace
 Paul Ruback, a 50-year-old firefighter at Ladder Company 25, was nearing retirement without much of a plan.
 He had started to dabble in home inspection, but mostly he spent time with his 2-year-old son, also named Paul. ''Wherever he went, the baby was with him,'' said Debbie Macielag, the boy's mother. Firefighter Ruback had adopted several other children earlier in life, with his estranged wife, Lynne.
 Firefighter Ruback's friends remember him as quiet and nonconfrontational.
 ''He just wanted some peace and tranquillity,'' said Brian Englander, a fellow firefighter. Firefighter Ruback died as a hero, facing down a deadly fire because it was his job, but when adversity arose in his personal life, Firefighter Englander said, ''he would rather just turn and walk away.''

SHAI LEVINHAR
A New Passion
''The first time he tried to lean over, he fell down, and threw me down, and that's how we fell in love.''
 Liat Levinhar, back in Israel now, remembers how she tried to teach her husband to tango nearly a decade ago, before they married and moved to the United States. ''I knew him from the army, so I taught him how to dance,'' she said.
 He wanted to learn, and his exuberance extended past the dance floor. Shai Levinhar knew little about the United States when he arrived, so he asked a lot of questions. Friends explained, precisely and in sometimes painful detail, why the New York Giants lost Super Bowl XXXV. Co-workers explained that they did not directly pay for their children's education; rather, they paid property taxes. ''He really wanted to know,'' said Ken McCollister, a colleague at eSpeed.
 Mr. Levinhar finished an executive M.B.A. program in July, just in time to clear his schedule for a new passion. His daughter, Sapir Natalie, was born Aug. 2, 2001.
 Paul Calacicco, the doorman at his building on East 83rd Street, remembers trying to give Mr. Levinhar his packages when he arrived home from work. '' 'I'll pick it up later,' '' he recalled Mr. Levinhar as saying on those occasions. ''He was just so excited to go upstairs and see the kid.''

MICHAEL F. LYNCH
'An Unbelievable Dad'
 On his days off, Lt. Michael F. Lynch, a firefighter at Ladder Company 4 in Manhattan, loved to play with toy dinosaurs with his elder son, Michael, 3. They would line them up by type and take them for ''far walks'' -- a game in which the dinosaurs foraged for food and water.
 ''He was an unbelievable dad,'' said his wife, Denise. She said he would come home from a 24-hour shift and see their other son, John Ryan, known as Jack, and say how ''shocked he was at how much Jack had grown.'' Jack is 1 year old today.
 His nieces and nephews called Lieutenant Lynch, 33, who was 6 feet 5 inches and 230 pounds, Big Mike. The firefighters in Ladder 4 called him Prancer, a nickname given him the night he thought he heard a bell and started jumping around the firehouse looking for it. Mrs. Lynch called him ''drop-dead gorgeous.'' 
 Lieutenant Lynch was last seen on Sept. 11 helping people trapped in an elevator in the lobby of 2 World Trade Center. Mrs. Lynch hopes to meet someone from that elevator because she is certain that its occupants survived. She said, ''Those people were in good hands with my husband.''

MICHAEL PATRICK TUCKER
'The Perfect Balance'
 One reason the members of Michael Patrick Tucker's big family have such a hard time believing that he is gone is that they have so much to remember about him.
 How he rented a friend's walk-in closet at Syracuse University and moved in, cot, clothes and all, when his father tried to encourage better grades by cutting his housing allowance. How his two little girls, Taylor, 10, and Gaffney, 7, would scream and laugh as he slithered on the floor, playing shark. How he took over the care of his twin boys, Morgan and Andy, when he got home to Rumson, N.J., each night. And how hard he worked, rising at 5 a.m. to be at his desk at Cantor Fitzgerald, on the 104th floor of the World Trade Center's north tower, where at 40 he was a partner and executive vice president.
 ''I find it just amazing that he was capable of working in a very demanding job and spend every moment that he had with his wife and kids, and still be able to have a good time fishing and going golfing with his friends,'' said his youngest brother, Chris Tucker. ''He just had the perfect balance that I am still struggling to find.''
 June Rozniak, the mother of Mr. Tucker's wife, Mary Beth, said, ''He was Michael, he was Mike, he was Tuck to his friends from school and he was Daddy, and he's still making us smile.''

ROBERT JALBERT
A Bear's Migration
 Robert Jalbert sold foam, all kinds. He sold the little bits found in the corners of printer cartridges. He sold foam for parts of wheelchairs.
 He was 61 and had 20 years in the business. With just a look, he could advise clients on what kind of foam they needed, said his wife, Catherine Jalbert.
 Mr. Jalbert, who lived in Swampscott, Mass., was one of the top salesmen at the Rogers Foam Corporation in Somerville, Mrs. Jalbert said. He was going on a business trip when he left Boston's Logan Airport on United Flight 175, the second plane to hit the World Trade Center.
 Work was important to Mr. Jalbert, but his family was his fulcrum. He had a running joke with his son-in-law, John McCormick. When a daughter, Suzanne, first married Mr. McCormick about nine years ago, Catherine Jalbert gave them a brass bear candleholder as a housewarming present. No one liked it, Mrs. Jalbert recalled. It was about the size of a golf ball. 
 To get rid of it, Mr. McCormick gave it to Mr. Jalbert as a gift. Mr. Jalbert gave it back. The trading went on for years on various holidays. One Christmas, Mr. Jalbert put the bear between two large teddy bear bookends. When Mr. McCormick lifted them out of the box, the bear fell to the floor.
 Another year, Mr. McCormick gave Mr. Jalbert the Physicians' Desk Reference, with pages dug out from the center. ''When my husband opened up the book,'' Mrs. Jalbert said, ''there was the bear.''

JOHN HEFFERNAN
Man With Many Sides
 Mary Heffernan's spirit just left her on the day of the attacks. One of her sons, John Heffernan, 37, a firefighter on the Lower East Side, was missing at the World Trade Center. Five years earlier, her son Patrick had died in a construction accident.
 Another son, Michael Heffernan, 36, also a firefighter, looked for his big brother. He searched for weeks. Their sister, Deirdre Heffernan, 32, stayed with their 73-year-old mother. A fourth brother, Brian, 34, is a New York City police officer.
 John Heffernan was a man with many sides. One moment, he was in a firefighter's uniform, rushing into burning buildings to save lives at the risk of his own. In the next, he was on stage in a black T-shirt and jeans, playing rhythm guitar in a punk rock band, the Bullys, that he helped found. In another, he was a devoted husband to his wife, Lori, and a devoted father to his 9-year-old daughter, Samantha.
 A crew sifting through the wreckage at ground zero discovered John Heffernan's body on Oct. 2, his wife's 31st birthday, Deirdre Heffernan said.

ERIC T. ROPITEAU
Discovered on a Skateboard
It could be said that Eric T. Ropiteau, who was 24, cruised into his New York life. On a skateboard, in fact. 
 He was riding along a downtown street a little more than a year ago, visiting a friend in the city, when a photographer spotted him and urged him to pursue a modeling career. Mr. Ropiteau, who stood 6-feet-4 and had deep brown eyes, signed right up. Later, when he looked around for something else, a classmate from the University of Vermont, from which he graduated in 2000, suggested he apply for an opening at TradeSpark, a subsidiary of Cantor Fitzgerald. He began working there last June, at first sharing a computer with his friend, Joshua M. Piver.
 Ebullient and outgoing, he loved to draw and to give things names: his car was White Rhino and a bonsai tree he bought in early September with his girlfriend, Fabienne Schultness, became Herbert. He, Mr. Piver and two of their friends signed a lease for a big apartment in Park Slope, Brooklyn, on Sept. 10. Afterward, he called his mother, Barbara R. Galloway. ''Mom!'' he told her. ''I have Perma-grin. Did you hear me, Mom? I have Perma-grin.'' 
 Ms. Galloway said yes, she heard him. ''He was so happy,'' she said. ''Everything was going so well.''

JOSHUA M. PIVER
Loving New York Living
 Joshua M. Piver spent his summers on the water, working at a boat yard in his hometown of Stonington, Conn., and sailing and kayaking every chance he got. His friends remember him as someone who stayed calm in all sorts of situations. ''I'm the only person who ever caused him to lose his temper, and that's because I was trying to,'' said David Wilson, who met him in the fourth grade, went through the University of Vermont with him and was set to live with him in Brooklyn last fall. Socializing with Mr. Piver was always deflating, he added: ''He was tall, extremely good-looking, and girls never talked to me when he was around.'' 
 He graduated in 2000 with a degree in economics and went to work at Cantor Fitzgerald, on the 105th floor of 1 World Trade Center. He traded pollution credits and energy credits for TradeSpark, said his sister, Erica. 
 His passions ranged from jazz and the movie ''Dr. Strangelove,'' to food. ''He loved living in New York and going to restaurants and going to movies and all of those things,'' said Rebecca Stevens, a friend. ''He was just so excited about everything.''

RAY MURPHY
Home Improvement
 In 1981, Ray Murphy bought a Reader's Digest book on home improvement. By 1993, he was buying a fixer-upper to turn into his wife's dream home. ''When we saw the house in 1993, my kids and I were like, 'Ray, this house is horrible,' '' recalled his wife, Linda Murphy. ''He said, 'No, it will be beautiful.' And it is.''
 ''Anything he latched on to he devoured intellectually or physically,'' said his brother Edward J. Murphy. ''He didn't take to school as well as anybody else but he grew up to be the brightest person I ever met.''
 While he loved carpentry, his skills also helped him absorb the significant pay cut he took when he quit being a Perrier salesman and became a New York City firefighter. He rose to the rank of lieutenant. ''We used to kid, 'If you ever won the lottery, would you quit the Fire Department?' '' his wife said. ''He'd say, 'Oh, no.' He loved it.''
 But for Lieutenant Murphy, 46, and the father of two, it wasn't just about helping others while on the job, his brother said: ''If anybody needed help, there he was in his truck, his ladder and tools in the back.''

LARRY J. SENKO
Savoring the Moment
Five years ago, when Debbi Senko was teaching at an elementary school, her husband used to send her flowers at work. A lot. ''All the women would get jealous and say, 'Oh, more flowers for you,' '' she said. ''So one time, when he sent flowers, he included one rose for every woman in my wing.''
 Gallantry came naturally to Larry J. Senko, who grew up in tiny Donora, Pa., but had big-city sensibilities. ''I lived in a city all my life, but he was more cosmopolitan than I,'' Mrs. Senko said. ''He loved fast cars, nice dinners; he loved art.'' Mr. Senko, 34, also loved working in 1 World Trade Center, where he was an area vice president for Alliance Consulting.
 But he also had a down-home side. He met his wife in a local bar; both had followed the Grateful Dead, and the two began going to shows together. Years later, Mr. Senko would wake up early on Sunday mornings to play guitar for their son Tyler, 2. ''Recently he'd moved from the Grateful Dead to 'If You're Happy and You Know It, Clap Your Hands,' '' Mrs. Senko said.
 ''We were just starting to realize our dreams,'' Mrs. Senko said, adding that they had just built a house in Yardley, Pa. In August, when Mr. Senko gave her a surprise birthday party there, they stopped to savor the moment. ''We were looking around and saying how grateful we were for everything,'' she said. ''Sometimes you don't get the chance to say that.''

 GRACEFULLY INSANE
The Rise and Fall of America's
Premier Mental Hospital.
By Alex Beam.
Illustrated. 273 pp. New York:
PublicAffairs. $26.
 "CLAYMOORE is a top-notch place," the psychiatrist tells a suicidal Winona Ryder at the start of the movie "Girl, Interrupted," urging her to commit herself to a nearby asylum with a national reputation. "A lot of people go there -- even writers. Like you!" Now that depression has become a literary subgenre, with confessional memoirs of the self-consciously despondent topping the charts, it would be hard to think of a more persuasive marketing campaign for a mental hospital. Claymoore is in fact McLean, in Belmont, Mass., where Susanna Kaysen, author of the best-selling book on which the film is based, spent nearly two years in the late 60's. Other illustrious alumni (to name only the writers) include Robert Lowell, Sylvia Plath and Anne Sexton, who, before being admitted herself, taught a Tuesday night poetry seminar in the hospital library. On the basis of literary achievement alone, McLean would seem to have a better track record than many institutions of higher learning. 
McLean figures in the biographies of these and other famous patients, among them, the mathematician John Forbes Nash, winner of the Nobel in economic science; Ray Charles (following a drug bust); the Taylors -- James, Livingston and Kate; and several analysands notorious in psychiatric circles, to say nothing of Frederick Law Olmsted, who, having planned the hospital's new campus after its move from nearby Charlestown in 1895, lived out his last years there in a single-patient home, the victim of a series of brain hemorrhages. Now we have the biography of the place itself, its title taken from what Sexton admiringly said of Lowell: "You are so gracefully insane."
A columnist for The Boston Globe, Alex Beam succeeds in telling several stories simultaneously, weaving an account of changing attitudes toward mental illness, the methods employed in its treatment and the shifting context of the larger culture into an entertaining narrative that centers on the hospital and its history. McLean was founded in the early 19th century, the product of an idea born in Europe -- that a bucolic setting might prove beneficial to the mentally ill. The only hospital of its kind in Boston at the time, McLean catered to patients from every level of society until 1833, when the Worcester State Asylum opened its doors and siphoned off those too poor to pay their own way. From then on, McLean specialized in the treatment of a clientele that Lowell called "the thoroughbred mental cases." Indeed, the accommodations and services seem to have been modeled on those of a five-star hotel: fireplaces, private bathrooms and ample closet space; two tennis courts, two indoor gymnasiums and a nine-hole golf course, plus croquet, ice skating and cross-country skiing on the grounds; room service and restaurant-quality food; silver tea sets, antique furniture and Oriental rugs. On behalf of the patients, the nursing staff wrote thank-you notes, sent flowers and, with the arrival of warm weather each spring, arranged for the transfer of their furs into cold storage. Upham Memorial, a men's residence, was nicknamed "the Harvard Club" because at one time its four corner suites were all said to be occupied by Harvard graduates. 
Over the years, as one seemingly arbitrary theory of mental illness gave way to another, so did its hypothetical cures, and Beam describes the harrowing array of treatments to which this hapless population was subjected -- not only electric shock but lobotomy, insulin coma and hypothermia, reducing the patient's body temperature to a near-death state. The indulgence inherent in the service was offset during the 50's by an approach called "total push," which obliged residents to get out of their pajamas, get dressed and go for walks, as if a strong dose of Calvinist rigor could cure patients who traced their lineage to the Mayflower. 
Beam remarks on Olmsted's layout, which "relegated deeply disturbed patients to the periphery of the grounds, where their rantings resounded offstage." The same might be said for "Gracefully Insane," which depicts McLean's patients as charmingly eccentric, harmful primarily to themselves. Even Louis Agassiz Shaw, a murderer and a snob who inhabited a book-lined suite in Upham Memorial, and Carl Liebman, a paranoid schizophrenic unsuccessfully analyzed by Freud, are cheerfully presented in the context of a cast straight out of a 30's screwball comedy. Shaw, who had strangled his maid, acquires a sidekick, "a Bible-thumping companion" by the name of Joan Tunney Wilkinson, daughter of the famous boxer Gene Tunney and sister of Senator John Tunney, accused of killing her husband on Easter Sunday, 1970. "At McLean," Beam writes, she "came under the sway of the Christian revival group the Way. . . . At hall meetings . . . Wilkinson was wont to say, 'Louis, we must confess our sins.' His inevitable answer: 'Oh, Joan, no.' " Liebman, whose conviction that he was being followed by detectives was cited by his doctors as evidence of his incurable paranoia, was in fact being followed by detectives, who had been hired by his family. 
However tragic the circumstances, there is no lack of humor here, some of it in Beam's wry asides, much of it implicit in the deadpan choice of material and in a penchant for understatement on the part of the authorities. Even the patients themselves, it seems, recognized the entertainment value in their surroundings. In 1958, they wrote and staged a musical, "Close to Home," an hourlong parody of life at the Belmont Hill Bettering House, where Andy, a protagonist with a drinking problem, undergoes the psychoanalytic scrutiny of the staff and in the end finds romance with another patient, culminating in a lyrical duet, "In Love, Sort Of." The show was a triumph, playing to packed houses on three evenings, and was taken on the road to the Austen Riggs sanitarium in Stockbridge, Mass. The librettist, Beam tells us, later committed suicide. 
These high jinks are a far cry from Lowell's experience, judging from the plaintive references to McLean that made their way into his work and from accounts by members of the staff and fellow inmates. In his manic phases, he devoted himself to fruitless exercises like rewriting famous poems in the Norton Anthology; in the throes of depression, he underwent electroshock treatments. Plath commemorated her stay at McLean in her autobiographical novel, "The Bell Jar." Four years after her release, she noted in her journal that a recent issue of Cosmopolitan contained two articles about mental health: "I must write one about a college girl suicide," she wrote. "And a story, a novel even. . . . There is an increasing market for mental-hospital stuff. I am a fool if I don't relive, recreate it." Little did she know just how large that market would become. Kaysen, Andrew Solomon, Emily Fox Gordon, Elizabeth Wurtzel and others have lately documented their journey to the brink of despair and back in accounts influenced by Plath's, Lowell's and Sexton's examples, even when those examples are not invoked. 
This new generation of memoirs, and to a certain degree this book, promulgates an idea of madness more becoming and more easily digestible than the confounding, occasionally horrific reality. It's hard to reconcile the setting of "Gracefully Insane" -- the luxurious appointments, the pastoral surroundings, the lovable eccentrics -- with the desolate interior landscape of the mentally ill, which Beam makes no attempt to convey. For that, the reader must turn to William Styron, whose brutally straightforward "Darkness Visible" manages to capture the full force of the suffering: the isolation, the tedium, the life gone stale. Beam's guided tour bypasses the schizophrenics, the drug addicts and any number of other less picturesque patients, like those prone to violence and in need of restraining. On the basis of "Gracefully Insane," the reader might conclude that bluebloods make a better class of mental patient: even with a few screws loose, their manners are intact. 
Strapped for cash and grappling for market share in the era of managed care, McLean is now headed the way of other once-august American institutions, its decline hastened by the advent of new drugs, most famously Prozac, that have shortened hospital stays and relegated certain mental illnesses to the outpatient clinics. At the start, Beam reports the board of directors' decision to sell off half of McLean's 250 acres in order to survive, and coming to the end of this lively account the reader can't help feeling a certain nostalgia and regret.

 IRISH ON THE INSIDE
In Search of the Soul of Irish America.
By Tom Hayden.
312 pp. New York:
Verso. $25.
 "I AM a believer in invisible ancestral influences," Tom Hayden writes in "Irish on the Inside," and I imagine that few people of Irish heritage anywhere in the world do not share that belief, at least privately. This book by the onetime New Left leader is a daring and sometimes awkward quest in the most ambitious Irish manner: a memoir, a confession, a catalog of invisible influences, an alternative history of Irish America and a call for its cultural and spiritual renewal. Many readers will no doubt take issue with Hayden's conclusions, but few will be able to dismiss them entirely.
"Where the trail of evidence disappears, where intellect fails," Hayden says, "one must rely on imagination, on possibilities that are technically unprovable." Indeed, for all Hayden's historical research and despite his delicately handled account of the painful birth of the contemporary "peace process" in Northern Ireland -- much of which he witnessed firsthand as a human rights observer -- this is primarily and unapologetically a work of the poetic imagination. 
In the book's first and most adventurous section, Hayden rambles through the fields of Irish and American history, as well as his own life story, making connections and drawing inferences wherever he can. A child of the fully assimilated Irish-American middle class -- whose parish priest in suburban Detroit was none other than Father Coughlin, the infamous anti-Semitic radio orator -- Hayden did not discover until he was a grown man that he had been named for the Irish rebel Thomas Emmet. (The name had been handed down in his family, its significance forgotten.) 
In examining the career of Emmet, a Protestant renegade who immigrated to America in 1804, became attorney general of New York and worked for both the cause of Irish freedom and the abolition of slavery, Hayden begins to uncover what he calls his "Irish radical past." This heritage includes the San Patricios, Irish famine immigrants who deserted the United States Army and fought for the Mexicans during the Mexican-American War; the Molly Maguires, the legendary saboteurs of the Pennsylvania coal fields; and the Land League of the 1870's, which sought to unite the Irish peasantry with the American labor movement.
Needless to say, these are not the protagonists of conventional up-by-the-bootstraps histories of the Irish in America, those miserable and despised immigrants who, as Hayden puts it, "became white, became conservative, became superpatriotic," and who in turn inflicted an ugly history of racist violence upon African-Americans, the only group below them on the social ladder. When Hayden went south in the early 1960's to join the civil rights movement, he was enlisting, he believes, in the alternate tradition of his radical Irish forebears without knowing it: "My Irishness was a hidden magnet drawing me towards dreams, underdogs, lost causes and crusades, to acts of defiance against hopelessness." 
In telling the story of his rediscovery of his roots, this great-grandson of famine immigrants from County Monaghan has an urgent message to deliver: the essential mythic and romantic qualities of the Irish character, he writes, are in danger of being destroyed, "to be replaced by a middle-class roboculture and an 'old country' that is marketed as a theme park for tourism," as well as an office park for multinational capital.
When Hayden labors to expose the hidden Irishness of such left-wing heroes as Che Guevara and C. Wright Mills, he is working too hard. When he claims that his own preference for blond, blue-eyed women is evidence that he was "sexually colonized" by Anglo-Saxon standards of attractiveness, one can only hope his tongue is planted firmly in his cheek. But his central question -- what role Irish identity can play in the age of a multicultural America, a united Europe and a globalized economy -- is one well worth exploring.
Authentic Irishness, Hayden argues, has to mean something more than getting drunk on St. Patrick's Day, attending Mass on Easter Sunday and rooting for Notre Dame (or, to cite a more contemporary version of Irish-American nostalgia, practicing a Celtic New Age spirituality of dubious provenance). Instead, he advocates "a new global Irish identity" that bypasses "the cliches of assimilation, neither clinging to parochial Catholic nationalist pride nor blending meekly into the English-speaking world." 
Hayden finds something of this new identity in contemporary Northern Ireland, which he has visited on numerous occasions and discusses eloquently here. Few Americans, and in fact few observers of any nationality, have written about that tormented province with such sympathy and clarity, and it's a relief to encounter someone halfway respectable taking the American political and journalistic establishment to task for its pro-British bias. I share Hayden's belief that Sinn Fein, the political movement associated with the now-decommissioned Irish Republican Army, has the potential to become a transformative force in peacetime Irish politics. But he seems distressingly reluctant to criticize any aspect of the I.R.A.'s campaign of violence, and barely acknowledges the extent to which it was bankrolled by precisely the kind of sentimental and ill-informed Irish-Americans he deplores.
ULTIMATELY, Hayden never quite defines his vision of global Irishness, although he writes his way around it in often lovely, imagistic prose. Essentially, he hopes that the recent groundswell of interest in Irish culture and heritage will breed a new generation of dissenters from what he sees as the Anglocentric myth of the American melting pot, from global corporate capitalism and even from the racial category of whiteness itself. (In filling out his 2000 census form, Hayden reports, he angrily crossed out the "white, non-Hispanic" category and wrote in "Irish, born in the United States, American citizen.")
This may be too much dissent to hope for. On the other hand, any Irish-American who has ever flown to Ireland will recognize Hayden's enthralled account of his 1971 voyage on Aer Lingus, whose noisy, convivial passengers didn't exactly seem "white" to him, but didn't seem alien either. Hayden stepped onto Irish soil for the first time feeling enchanted. Then the Irish police, unimpressed by his invisible ancestors, identified him as a dangerous radical and put him on the next plane back to New York.

HEADLINE: Belgrade Relishes Life At Peace 

BYLINE:  By NEIL STRAUSS; NEIL STRAUSS is a cultural correspondent for The Times in Los Angeles.

 BODY:
IN 1990, Belgrade was a bustling worldly city, an oasis of cafes, culture and night life that formed the cultural center of the Balkans. The next year, however, eight years of almost continuous war began, in which the old Yugoslavia broke up along the fault line of religious tensions and nationalism. The conflict culminated in 1999 when NATO bombed Serbia to force the Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic to withdraw his security forces from Kosovo.
 Today, on first impression, you'd never know that Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia, had just surfaced from a long, gruesome war that decimated its economy and destroyed tourism. On a monthlong visit to Yugoslavia in September, during which I traveled from the monasteries of the north to the beautiful Montenegrin coast in the south, I was surprised to find myself constantly drawn back to Belgrade. 
 My companion was an old high-school friend, Marko, who had just decided to return to his home country. In kindergarten in Chicago, we used to make fun of Marko for being Serbian. We didn't actually know what Serbian was: it was just different. Now, so many years later, I was surprised to find myself not only joining him in Serbia (Yugoslavia comprises Serbia and Montenegro) but also finding its social life so appealing. 
Belgrade itself has had a long and troubled history. Strategically situated at the confluence of the Sava and the Danube Rivers, it has been destroyed on numerous occasions since Roman times. The Sava bisects the more picturesque old city (which contains only a few streets with buildings that have survived since the late 18th century and the Beaux-Arts boom 100 years ago) from new Belgrade, a very unappealing sprawl of Socialist-style apartment-block housing. The city's official population is around two million, but that doesn't include a substantial community of war refugees. 
Despite its poverty, Belgrade is an astonishingly stylish place on first impression. Its countless cafes were packed day and night; the clubs on boats moored along the Danube and the Sava were filled with boisterous revelers; the city's main tourist attraction, the Kalemegdan Fortress, was overrun with embracing couples; and the pedestrian mall in the old city was teeming with leggy women and muscular crew-cut men.
On closer inspection, however, something seemed odd. At the cafes, the most animated topic of conversation, even among schoolchildren, was politics. At the clubs, most patrons had enough disposable income for just one drink or perhaps two; from the Kalemegdan Fortress, the blackened and bombed-out Socialist Party headquarters was visible; and in the pedestrian mall, tourist stands sold "Serbia by Night" postcards depicting a burning wartime skyline.
Add together these two profiles of Belgrade and you have what Americans sometimes call "the new normal." This is a city recovering its pride, spirit and resilience after a war and residents call a revolution, the overthrow of Slobodan Milosevic. Perhaps the most poignant example I saw of this post-trauma business-as-usual mentality was a computer screen saver in the window of a car dealership. Scrolling across the screen in large red letters was: "What has happened to the world we once knew??" 
Though a State Department consular information sheet issued in August notes that "no specific threats or incidents of harassment involving American citizens have been reported since the Kostunica government took office in October 2000," Serbia nonetheless attracts few American or other tourists these days. It is, however, a very easy place to visit. As one Serbian told me, "There are no cheesy tourist traps in Belgrade, because there are no tourists." 
A disadvantage is that few hotels and banks, and almost no restaurants, accept foreign credit cards, and cash machines don't recognize American bank and credit cards. Travelers are advised to take plenty of cash, preferably changed into euros (which are accepted almost everywhere).
Visiting Belgrade is an especially strange experience for an American. Before Sept. 11, Serbians liked to point out the five or so NATO-bombed buildings in the city center and ask Americans, with more curiosity than hostility, "Why did you bomb us?" During a brief visit in January, the comments I heard were more along the lines of, "Now you understand." But as anyone who has studied the complex politics of the region or read Rebecca West's complex and wonderful 1,100-page-plus Yugoslav travelogue "Black Lamb and Grey Falcon" knows, we don't really understand. 
For hundreds of years, Serbia has been the whipping boy of the Mediterranean. A barrier between Muslim Asia and Christian Europe, it was occupied and over the course of 500 years, it was often ravaged by the Turks. (On a day trip to the beautiful medieval monasteries around Belgrade, it was rare to find a church that hadn't suffered significant destruction by the Turks.) 
Then after 63 years of tenuous autonomy, which was constantly sabotaged by Austro-Hungarian manipulation, Serbia faced devastation in World War II. It is still possible to envision the paths the Nazi bombers took when they bombarded the city if you look for diagonal strips of newer buildings surrounded by older apartments.
Add the trauma and unrest of the Balkan wars of the 1990's, which have ended but resolved little, and most visitors today leave with the impression that Serbia is simply between wars. But Belgrade's resilient spirit can be seen every day in its cafes and streets. A visit should not be mired in the past (the National Museum of Art is so lacking in funds that its collections of Renaissance, medieval and foreign art are locked away in the basement). It is for enjoying the moment. 
Belgrade's inhabitants clearly do this well: they remain among Europe's handsomest people, proud and stylish. A strict macho code is enforced among the men, who rarely smile, while the women wear designer impostors of surprisingly high quality. There is a common joke that the average Serbian makes $100 a month, but spends $200 a month on clothes. 
The trendy denizens of the city can be seen most warmer days on Prince Michael Street (a store-lined pedestrian road in the center of old Belgrade), which is typically bursting with life, its cafes teeming with students, politicians, artists and intellectuals. Rewards for the tourist are in the details: the joke-cracking flutist panhandler, the peasant musician playing the a bagpipelike instrument made from a sheep bladder, and especially the postcard stands. 
Nearly half of the postcards show photos of bombed Belgrade buildings or pay tribute to Belgraders' defiant spirit during the NATO bombing. A card showing boys scampering around twisted wreckage comments sarcastically: "The children playground, designed by NATO." Another pictures the supposedly undetectable F-117A spy plane that was shot down. It reads: "Sorry, we didn't know it was invisible. Greetings from Serbia."
Several blocks away from all this morbid wit is the University of Philosophy, which houses a bookstore and cafe, both called Plato, that can serve as a good home base. A mostly outdoor affair with chic modern decor, Cafe Plato was a good place to meet and make new friends. More than half the people I tried to talk to spoke at least conversational English, and were happy to talk politics, compare cultures, lambaste Slobodan Milosevic or crack jokes over a $2 sandwich or a delicious $1 banana frappe while listening to a student jazz band on the balcony above. 
Adjoining the cafe, the bookstore offered Internet access, a decent selection of books in English, and a well-read cashier who recommended "Death and the Dervish" by Mesa Selimovich. The nearby ? Cafe, the oldest in town, offered more rustic charm, traditional food, and a taste of Belgrade's intellectual life of yesteryear. On arriving one afternoon, Marko and I found a table of old-timers belting out traditional songs in a baritone sing-along.
Perhaps my favorite site in the city is a work in progress, the immense St. Sava Temple, off the Bulevar JNA. Modeled after the Hagia Sofia in Istanbul (and built to scale), St. Sava has been under construction since before World War II and shows no signs of being completed any time soon. 
But the structure stands, and it's intriguing to wander in and see the largest cathedral in the Balkans filled with bulldozers and a crane. The security guard, for a small tip, took Marko and me up flights of stairs to a walkway around the exterior of the dome, which offered an even more beautiful view of the Belgrade skyline than the one from the Kalemegdan Fortress. Afterward, he showed us every detail of the cathedral, from the mosaics that had only just begun to cover the immense interior to the different types of marble being fitted to the exterior.
The greatest pleasure of Belgrade, however, was its cafes and clubs. The Serbian capacity for night life is nothing short of amazing: some diehards go out seven nights a week, and still manage to make it to work the next morning. When I refused cigarettes, alcohol or coffee, most Serbians, whether teenagers or grandparents, looked at me in shock and asked a variation of, "What is the point of living without these small pleasures?"
Around dusk, I liked to stroll along the ramparts of the Kalemegdan Fortress to Cafe Cinema, a sprawl of tables and balconies arranged at the very top of the stone stronghold. At that time of day, wolves could be seen baying in the zoo below. On weekend nights, live bands performed and hundreds of tables filled with glamorous Belgrade youth while revelers flocked to Klub Cvijeta elsewhere in the fortress.
Afterward, for a traditional Serb meal, we would wander Skadarska, a cobbled street two blocks from Prince Michael Street, once the Montmartre of Belgrade. Besides the statues, galleries and museums dedicated to the artists who once lived there, Skadarska is known for its dozen-plus restaurants, with large outdoor cafes and roving string bands. 
The restaurants -- That Hat of Mine, the Three Hats, the Two Deer, and There Are Days -- most dating to the first half of the 19th century, still serve quality traditional favorites: njegoseva persutto (a thin ham usually served with kajmak, a rich spread that's equal parts butter and cheese), karadjeordjeva snicla (snicla means schnitzel), and filet mignon in mushroom sauce. The food was especially good at Ima Dana.
For a young, modern take on Serbian cuisine and dining rituals, a more hedonistic time was to be had at Reka, about 15 minutes away on the bank of the Danube. There is only one seating, around 10 p.m, and people stay very late. The crowd, mostly from the theater community, and the bright lights, colorful paintings and an arty ambience gave it the feel of a hip East Village restaurant. 
Most patrons drank the smooth Montenegrin wine before feasting on seafood. The fresh trout and the risotto with calamari went down as smoothly as the wine. After dining, we danced with other patrons to live music, in this case a talented cover band that played equal parts rock and roll, torch songs and Serbian pop.
For a late-night dinner, Klub Knjizevnika (Writers Club) offered another scene, one of artists, writers and celebrities in constant heated debate. Its food -- particularly the rich, cool ajvar (chopped pepper salad) and tender lamb -- ranks among the city's best.
After dinner, we usually walked to the picturesque, tree-lined Strahinjica Bana in the old city. Though taxis are cheap in Belgrade, gas prices are so high that many drivers refuse short trips. Strahinjica Bana is lined with cafes that serve as popular resting places between dinner and clubbing. Among the best were the oddly named Mamma's Biscuit House (known locally as Stelina), which specializes in fruit jams and fresh fruit cups topped with homemade whipped cream, and the more upscale, trendy Studio.
After coffee and dessert, the night finally begins in earnest. In the last few years, the banks of the Sava and the Danube have become lined with about 150 boats, most of them ad hoc nightclubs that are packed every night in spring and summer. Any visitor can take a taxi to Dunavski Kej Usce, Bulevar Nikole Tesle or Savski Kej, walk along the river and choose a floating scene, from black-lighted ships blasting techno to immense floating restaurants to grungy rock schooners. 
The most interesting were the careening Gypsy music clubs and the ones with cover bands playing Serbian pop, to which women gyrated their hips like belly dancers while men locked arms and sang along drunkenly. The lyrics, in Serbian, were fantastic odes to intoxicated, passionate nights that the singers hoped would never end.
And in Belgrade, the night doesn't have to end. There's still Quorom 33 and the Underground for late-night dancing on weekends, and after-hours at Nana doesn't get going until 3 a.m. At dawn, revelers stop by Nislija, a fast-food stand across the street from Tas, a more upscale club frequented by local gangsters. There, one can savor pljeskavica, a spicy hamburger, and watch an event that is an anathema in most Serbian pop songs: sunrise.

HEADLINE: SPRING THEATER; 
Six Decades Later, Still The Great American Musical

BYLINE:  By ETHAN MORDDEN; Ethan Mordden's latest book is "Open a New Window: The Broadway Musical in the 1960's" (Palgrave).

 BODY:
HERE'S an "Oklahoma!" story: shortly before rehearsals began, one of the show's producers, Theresa Helburn, told the librettist Oscar Hammerstein II that he and the composer Richard Rodgers ought to write "a song about the earth."
 Bewildered, Hammerstein asked Helburn what she meant. 
 She wasn't sure herself. "Just a song about the earth," she repeated. "The land." 
That, of course, was to be the show's rousing, even ecstatic title song. However, while creating an anthem for the land, Rodgers and Hammerstein were also singing of the people who settle on and develop it -- all of it. The song is called "Oklahoma," but it really means "Americans": their morality and government and spirit, how they learn the arts of compromise and tolerance in order to deserve the liberty that democracy fosters.
The people will get a chance to sample the show's unique explanation of how Americans invent themselves on March 21, when "Oklahoma!" opens on Broadway almost exactly 59 years after its premiere. This revival at the Gershwin Theater, directed by Trevor Nunn, was first mounted for the Royal National Theater in London. Unusually, it is neither a Highly Important Deconstruction by a Wunderkind Director (as with the current "Cabaret," reconceived by Sam Mendes) nor an affable reimagining (as with the recently departed "Annie Get Your Gun").
Mr. Nunn restored some dialogue from the musical's source, Lynn Riggs's play "Green Grow the Lilacs," and topped off "It's a Scandal! It's a Outrage!" with a few uncredited new lines. The choreographer Susan Stroman designed completely new dances to replace the original Agnes de Mille choreography, a feature of "Oklahoma!" revivals till now. Even the dance music itself has been newly arranged.
Above all, writers have commented on an unexpectedly dark feel to the story, typical of the modern musical but unusual two generations ago. Still, this is essentially the piece that Broadway first saw in 1943, running for five years when hit musicals lasted a year, and immediately becoming -- and then remaining -- the Great American Musical.
Why this one? Doesn't the picture of courtship rites among cowboys and their girls and its territorial feud between farmers and ranchers seem quaint today? Is the entire first act really about whether or not Curly will take Laurey to the box social? It sounds awfully corny.
Well, here's another "Oklahoma!" story. In the 1940's, musicals rehearsed with the cast broken into separate groups. The composer, choreographer and dancing chorus might work in one place while the librettist, director and actors worked in another. There was a bit of sharing, and the singing chorus floated around as required. Still, a show's "parts" were made and then assembled, which is why most musicals never quite fit together.
Now, one Saturday, the director, Rouben Mamoulian, decided to run the first act. The show's parts were coming together for the first time, all the performers in one room, moving through the action from dialogue to song to dance. Hammerstein was in the country that weekend; Rodgers was taking it easy in his apartment. Perhaps Mamoulian thought this an ideal time to see what they had, in a relaxed workshop atmosphere.
But something else happened that day. Speech effortlessly slipped into music and song reached for dance to express what words cannot, and everyone present began to realize how inevitably "Oklahoma!" unfolded. It was one thing happening all the way along, like a pane of glass. De Mille followed the feminist number "Many a New Day" with an extrapolation of woman's restless dreams of escape from a system run by men; the slimy villain sang a song of longing, "Lonely Room," that glowered like a depraved rainbow. The actors stood transfixed. They were gaping at something new in the musical: consistency. The parts matched. And the stage manager ran to the phone, called Richard Rodgers and said, "You'd better get down here quick!"
Because "Oklahoma!" was inaugurating a new age that very day. It was not the first integrated musical, as some seem to think. But it was the first universally popular integrated musical in which every aspect of composition and production enhanced the narrative. The parts didn't just match. They made love to one another. As Rodgers himself put it, "The orchestrations sound the way the costumes look." 
So "Oklahoma!" became most people's idea of The One. But why has it remained so, after longer-running hits like "My Fair Lady" and "A Chorus Line" or such critics' conjuring tools as "Gypsy" and "Follies"? Even Riggs's totally forgotten play is, paradoxically, famous -- simply for being the totally forgotten blueprint for "Oklahoma!"
Oddly, that original "Green Grow the Lilacs," in 1931, was already a sort of musical. Folk songs were interpolated into the action, mainly for atmosphere but also for character. Riggs's hero, Curly, opened the show with the jaunty "Git Along, Little Dogies," just as Rodgers and Hammerstein's Curly opens "Oklahoma!" with -- well, one could call it expansively jaunty -- "Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin'."
Also oddly, the play's use of "Old Paint," "Home on the Range" and so on prefigures the folkish style in which Rodgers and Hammerstein sometimes worked. Like Irving Berlin's "God Bless America" and "White Christmas," their music can seem less invented than invoked, summoned up out of the hum of American life. In "Carousel," doesn't "You'll Never Walk Alone" sound like a hymn, "Blow High, Blow Low" like a sea chantey? I mean real ones. In "The Sound of Music," "Edelweiss" suggests a traditional ballad so authentically that many people assume it's folk music. So if "Green Grow the Lilacs" borrowed folk music, Rodgers and Hammerstein "wrote" folk music.
In "Oklahoma!," we hear a horse-and-buggy clip-clop in "The Surrey With the Fringe on Top" that simply doesn't belong in a Broadway pit. "The Farmer and the Cowman" is a vast barn dance, and "All er Nuthin' " struts bowlegged. It's a rodeo cantata. 
Still more oddly, while bearing the naive sound of folk music, the "Oklahoma!" songs utilize the sophistication of the best theater music in treating character. Curly's "Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin' " is sunny and teasing, like Curly himself, a waltz with the typical Rodgers "wrong note" (on "morn," in the first line). It's ravishing yet elemental, the signature of a young man with his history entirely in the future, happy to be where he is, doing what he does.
Comparably, Laurey's "Many a New Day" wears a twisty little turn in its melody. It suggests her capricious but also stubborn nature. Rodgers tweaks the tune -- that's the caprice -- but he goes on tweaking it, 10 times in a single chorus. That's stubborn.
In a way, these two songs are antagonists, just as the bickering lovers Curly and Laurey are. He is that despair of women, the eternal show-off who charms the world. He drives her crazy with his braggy self-confidence and skylarking improvisations. That surrey with the fringe on top? Sheer invention. "Made the whole thing up outa my head," he taunts, as she flies into a rage and tries to run him off her spread.
Yes, Laurey is a landowner, her own master. Is she, in fact, the show's protagonist? Hammerstein's work is filled with strong women, from Rose-Marie to Anna Leonowens (in "The King and I"), and while he and Rodgers don't exactly take Curly for granted, they honor Laurey with the most prestigious element of 30's-40's-50's musical comedy: a Dream Ballet.
This genre stops the action to explore it psychologically. It was de Mille's idea to confront Laurey with conflicting temptations, one romantic (with Curly) and one fleshly (with Jud). To this point, Laurey seems to be torn between them. But the ballet, titled "Laurey Makes Up Her Mind," finds Jud murdering Curly and carrying Laurey off. Is this what she wants? What she fears? Or is she simply too sensitive a soul for pioneer territory?
Far more amenable to life in the wild is Ado Annie, whose relationship with the cowboy Will Parker balances the idyll of Curly and Laurey. Laurey is intelligent and complex; Annie is a puffcake. She is also as available as Laurey is self-protected, the girl who famously "cain't say no."
But Will is as steady as Curly is wild. Curly will have to settle down; Will is already settled. And that's Will's problem: Annie is wild, too. It is as if the characters were taking on the nature of their region, as if pioneering made folks into authoritarians or rebels. The wilderness needs culture and law, but too much control creates doubters, brawlers, or even, like Annie, flirts. One has the feeling that a nationality is being revealed in microcosm, not merely as farmers and cowmen but as personalities. The land tells us who the people are. And we had better know: this is a place where problems are settled by shotgun. 
It has to be, for the aforementioned slimy villain, Jud, is the sort who likes to incinerate those who thwart his will. Part of this show's ebullient Americana is the unpleasant truth that evil will keep coming at you until you kill it. One piece of democracy is the harmonizing of discordant agendas. But another piece is the expunging of the wicked.
One more reason for the prominence of "Oklahoma!" lies in its timing. Depression economics had forced musicals of the 1930's to favor easy entertainment. They offered star turns and fun but lacked content. It was Ethel Merman Sings Her Cole Porter Torch Song; or Bert Lahr Spoofs the Fancy-Pantses; or even the two together in Louis XV wigs in "DuBarry Was a Lady."
This explains why the show was originally such a hard sell to investors. It's a cliche as celebrated as "Oklahoma!" itself. But so what? Breakthrough art always has trouble arranging its start-up financing. What matters is the show's unprecedented success, which pointed the way to musicals that were about something and which ultimately led Merman herself to play the mother of all mothers in "Gypsy," one of the most about-something shows of all time.
The influence of "Oklahoma!" was not only lasting but immediate, as writers investigated historical American subject matter and producers made pets of de Mille and the new young ballet guys who rose up in her wake, like Jerome Robbins and Michael Kidd. Only it wasn't ballet any more. Ballet was so 30's. Now it was: Dance, with its synthesis of hoofing and arabesque, as if Martha Graham had married the Nicholas Brothers. "One Touch of Venus," "Bloomer Girl," "On the Town," "Sing Out, Sweet Land!," "Brigadoon" and "Paint Your Wagon" count among the musicals made possible by "Oklahoma!" Countless others were made better. The show most directly produced by "Oklahoma!" was, of course, "Carousel," Rodgers and Hammerstein's second collaboration. Their third, "Allegro," invented the concept musical. But their first, "Oklahoma!," invented the musical. 
That is, "Oklahoma!" reconceived this indigenous American form from the makeshift to the organic, from entertainment to enlightenment. It is worth noting that even Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein's "Show Boat," the first of the great musicals and older than "Oklahoma!" by more than 15 years, came under the influence of "Oklahoma!": in a revival in 1946. Produced by Rodgers and Hammerstein, this revision sought to reintegrate disparate elements of "Show Boat" along "Oklahoma!" lines -- to make those orchestrations, so to speak, reflect the costumes. Everything that mattered was turning into "Oklahoma!"
The show's subsequent history typifies the classic: a major and quite faithful film version in 1955; remountings of the original staging at City Center and Rodgers's own production at Lincoln Center in 1969; then a successful Broadway revival in 1979.
The present National Theater version was unveiled in 1998, with the about-to-be movie star Hugh Jackman and Josefina Gabrielle as Curly and Laurey; an American guest, Shuler Hensley, as Jud; and the English comic actress Maureen Lipman as Laurey's testy Aunt Eller. She referees the hostilities between both Curly and Laurey and the ranchers and farmers, and finally seems almost like the show's M.C. (The first character we see, she introduces the title song and generally shows up decisively every time the action gets dangerous.) Andrea Martin takes the role, with Patrick Wilson (of "The Full Monty") joining Ms. Gabrielle and Mr. Hensley from London. 
The British have a special relationship with "Oklahoma!" On its first London visit, in 1947, it was the biggest success in Drury Lane's 285-year history. More pertinent, it was a greeting from one ally to another after their triumphant defeat of fascism in the Second World War. Obviously, "Oklahoma!" opened on Broadway during that war -- precisely two months after the Battle of Stalingrad, which seemed a turning point in favor of the Allies. At the time, the show's message felt poignantly joyous amid so much death and destruction. In London in 1947, it was a kind of handshake, even an embrace after a job well done: the survival of a civilization.
Classic musicals are revived not only for their artistic quality but also for the feelings that they convey. "Show Boat" celebrates the diversity of America and its love of theater. "West Side Story" warns against intolerance. "A Chorus Line," when it reappears, will hearten us with those two Great American Things: show biz and being young.
"Oklahoma!" returns because it defines Americans as a people, generous but plain-spoken and tough on spoilers. Yet it is poetry -- the sunny rhapsody of the opening; the devolution of Curly's "Surrey" boasting into a lullaby of self-revealing tenderness using the same melody; the way "Out of My Dreams" so wistfully soars into the fantasy of a community united. 
Half a century after the premiere of "Oklahoma!," we are again at war, against the same kind of enemy as in 1943: solipsistic, vastly intolerant and gunning to restore Stone Age values. "Oklahoma!" reminds us why we fight. It's about the people, the land.

HEADLINE: After 3 Murders, a Neighborhood Worries 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD WEIZEL 

 BODY:
AFTER being jolted awake at 3 a.m. on Feb. 6 by the sound of the police and fire truck sirens and the glare of flashing lights that penetrated the shades of his bedroom window, Robert Fern couldn't believe what he saw out the window of his Jefferson Street home in Milford.
 A line of police cars had formed up and down the cul-de-sac where he and his family have lived for nearly 20 years. Dozens of police officers crouched behind the cars and had their guns pointed at the house directly across from his. 
 Mr. Fern said several SWAT team officers were putting on what appeared to be heavy suits of protection, and the police were screaming to anyone who came outside to go back in. 
Then "just like in the movies and on television" a man came out the front door and raised his arms in the air and yelled 'don't shoot, don't shoot," Mr. Fern said. "They ordered him to get down on the ground and within seconds he was handcuffed and in a police car. Not long after that it looked like they had carried out some bodies. It was all so surreal, it looked like a war scene."
A few hours later the police revealed that the city's first double homicide in more than 40 years had occurred during a two-hour hostage drama in which two women had escaped by jumping out a window to safety. Another woman living in the home had been sexually assaulted by her ex-boyfriend with their four-year-old daughter present. 
Two men who lived in the house, Richard Drury, 49, and his nephew, Mikel Brady Sr., 35, had been stabbed to death. Russell Dortche, 42, of West Haven, the former boyfriend of Mr. Drury's daughter, was arrested at the crime scene and still is being held in lieu of $5 million bail on two counts of murder, felony murder and other charges.
In a community where murders happen about every decade or so this was particularly unnerving: it was the second time killings had occurred there within nine months. 
About a half-mile away on a cozy street right along the beach off Bittersweet Road, Charles Ende, 72, recalled how it was just last May that he chatted with his neighbor, 28-year-old Kelsey Monahon, on a rainy spring afternoon. An hour or so later, Ms. Monahon, who was pregnant, was bound, gagged and strangled to death in her Shorefront Road apartment across the street. 
No arrests have been made, though the police have been assuring residents that this was not a random-intruder crime and that the victim very likely knew her assailants and willingly let them in.
"I've been living down here since 1958 and you don't expect something like this around here, that's for sure," said Mr. Ende, a retired grocery store manager. "This is such a peaceful, quiet beach community and when Kelsey was killed it was like a lightning bolt had hit the whole neighborhood. We're still in shock." 
Nine months later, the police and the state's attorney's office are still conducting what they say is an "active" investigation and again recently told residents they do not believe the murder was a random crime.
But the three killings in two separate incidents have so upset residents that many people are now locking their doors, even when they're home, and some are installing house alarms.
"We never used to lock our doors when we went down to the beach, but it's a different world now and I make sure to lock my door whenever I go out, especially after these latest killings," said Letitia Malone, who lives within a mile of Jefferson Street and has lived in the area for 54 years. 
"It's very disquieting, to say the least, and I think a lot of people in the community are feeling much more vulnerable," Mrs. Malone said. "The three murders couldn't help but have that effect. Over all it still feels safe, but who would have ever thought that something like this could happen around here, not just once, but twice within a year?"
Alderwoman Mary Lou Kecko, a member of the Walnut Beach Association that has been trying to promote the area's revitalization, said some people were more fearful, but others seemed more concerned that publicity about the killings would hurt the group's economic development efforts and property values. 
Ms. Kecko, who has lived in the community for several decades, has been trying to persuade residents that the two violent episodes, "while certainly not in the category of random and rampant crimes" should not be forgotten about so quickly either. She said it is important that residents be more aware of what is happening on their streets and that if something looks "even the slightest bit suspicious" they must get involved and at least call the police.
Ms. Kecko has been one of the leaders in the effort to transform the community into an artist's colony that would include new shops and restaurants to help revitalize an area that has never recovered from the closing of an amusement park about 50 years ago. 
About 10 years ago, neighborhood-watch programs and the police worked together to drive out motorcycle and youth gangs that were becoming involved in drug dealing. 
"There is a feeling of disgust, outrage and an element of fear by some, but then there are those who feel they are doing what they can and that this could have happened anywhere," Ms. Kecko said. "While it could have happened anywhere, the point is it happened here in our community and that's something we have to accept and deal with. We all need to look at what we can do to try and prevent horrific violent crimes like this in the future."
With that in mind, Vaughan Dumas an officer in the Milford Police Department, made a presentation last week to members of the Walnut Beach Association that included advice to residents on how to make their homes safer and what to watch out for in their neighborhood. Mr. Dumas, who serves as the department's community services and public information officer, told residents they should be vigilant about reporting anything unusual and to always lock their doors.
"The killers in all three murders entered through unlocked doors," Mr. Dumas said. "Keeping your doors unlocked is a definite no-no."
Because of the most recent homicides Mary Galvin, the state's attorney in New Haven, tried to assuage growing public fear.
"People need to calm down, it's not like there's some wild man running around out there who is going to strike again," Ms. Galvin said. "That is still an open investigation and police are still actively pursuing leads." Ms. Galvin declined comment on whether there was a specific suspect or suspects or whether there were any arrests imminent.
Groups like the Walnut Beach Association are trying to educate and inform both adults and children without unduly scaring them. Richard Freda, president of the association said he hoped the killings at least helped raise public awareness about safety without hurting the morale of the community.
"We all know how horrific these killings were and it's something, thank goodness, that is alien to us," said Mr. Freda, who has lived in a home near the beach since 1972. "But people just need to live their lives. You can't stop things like this and you can't stop your life when they happen."
Mr. Freda's wife Cathy Coda, 53, has lived near the beach her entire life. "I just don't remember any other murders," she said, "and while I do believe these are isolated incidents it's still a shocking thing when it happens right down the street."

Onward in Armonk

BYLINE:  By MAREK FUCHS 

 BODY:
THE doughnut machine snarled and hissed, a line stretched out the door and all the Schultz's Cider Mill regulars were there. For a moment, it looked like nothing had changed and nothing ever would. 
 Jim House, who ran a gas station and raised seven children in Armonk, was there. So was Nellie Palamarczuk, who was born in Armonk in 1930 and has lived here ever since. And my father, who for 30 years has come weekend mornings to read his newspapers over doughnuts and cider walked in too, though, probably for the first time, he had forgotten the newspapers. 
 In came LeRoy Mecklenburg. "You're still here?"
Buddy Schultz answered: "Another week."
"Good," said Mr. Mecklenburg, "but we've got to get you here another year. Actually, I'm 72. We've got to get you here until I die." 
The two friends shared a laugh, which was cut short by the dispiriting truth: Schultz's Cider Mill, a legend here for a half century, is closing at the end of the month. Staffed by three generations of the Schultz family, the roadside business has always sold freshly pressed apple cider, hot, fresh doughnuts and fresh vegetables. In 1964, what longtime residents call Armonk's second most famous business, I.B.M., opened their worldwide headquarters down the street. But, as if in rebellion against the computer age, Schultz's tabulates purchases on your shopping bag, in black crayon. 
Pilgrims came from all over to wait in line, but for those of us who grew up in Armonk, the cinnamon and sugar-powdered doughnuts were our collective madeleine. 
The regulars were always there, men and women who bought houses in Armonk when prices did not resemble the Gross Domestic Product of Finland. They sat on uncomfortable wood benches and enjoyed each other's company. 
To them, the closing of this place is emblematic of what has happened to their Armonk. 
Michael E. Fareri, a developer, is buying Schultz's and the land it sits on in a sale that is scheduled to close on March 28. Mr. Fareri plans to build about 30 single-family structures, the latest word in seven-figure housing. 
Rebecca A. Kittredge, the deputy supervisor of North Castle, which includes Armonk, said that she was sad Schultz's is closing. "But in fairness," she added, "the Schultz family wanted to retire and it's not the sort of business that someone else can come in and run."
Mrs. Palamarczuk, who came to Schultz's for the "camaraderie and the doughnuts," hardly recognizes the town that has been her home for 70 years. "Now," said Mrs. Palamarczuk, "you just pass these office buildings and big houses." 
The town always seemed one step removed from the commuter towns around it because it had no Metro-North train station. What was, even through most of the 1980's, a one-stoplight main street, has now been stretched much longer by strip malls. Of course, selection is much better now. You can get high-end catered food and even massages. But the town no longer has a supply of old-line places where people meet, the sort of places, like Schultz's, that defined Armonk. There was Doc's Pharmacy, which had a soda counter with stools, and Art's Stationery, which sold soda, newspapers, bags of popcorn -- everything, that is, except stationery. 
"There are no landmarks left," Mrs. Palamarczuk said. 
Armonk, to be sure, will go on. It's a quick drive from the planned development to I-684, on the side of town closest to the North White Plains train station, and the school system is excellent. In the homes that will rise, families will arrive, the kids will grow quicker than anyone had expected, and there will be happy times. 
But there used to be open space and woods, said Bruce Knox, who grew up in Armonk and still lives here. 
When he was a boy, he said, he and his brother, Jim, used to walk through the woods from their home in the Whippoorwill section of town and get on line at Schultz's where they would pass the time by trying to predict which lump of dough would wind through the Rube Goldberg-like machine and come out as their doughnut. Though the Knox brothers would like to make one last ceremonial walk to Schultz's, they cannot. "Those condos up behind where the bowling alley used to be took the place of the woods," Mr. Knox said. 
So where will my father and his friends go to sit in the future, I asked. My father shrugged. "I guess there's the Starbucks in Mount Kisco." He paused. "And also that Starbucks in Chappaqua."

Acronymania

BYLINE:  By William Safire

 BODY:
Who affixes glorious names to acts of Congress -- with words whose initial capital letters spell out a hard-selling acronym?
 When you ask a spokesman for the House Judiciary Committee who in the vast federal establishment came up with the u.s.a. patriot Act, you get a bravely bureaucratic, "It was a collaborative bipartisan effort of the full committee." That'll be the day. When you press further, you discover that a partial coiner was a determinedly anonymous staff member of the Senate Judiciary Committee who called the initial antiterrorism statute the Uniting and Strengthening America Act. (u.s.a. -- get it?) 
 But U.S.A. is a set of initial letters pronounced individually, not forming an acronym that can be pronounced as a word or is already a word. The key to infusing the quickly drawn legislation with a rousing title in which the flag fairly flapped came from House Judiciary. A junior staff member there named Chris Cylke achieved acronymic immortality by coming up with this inspiring moniker: Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001. Put it all together, and it spells patriot. 
Now join the House contribution with the Senate's name, and you get Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism -- the u.s.a. patriot bill, promptly signed by President Bush into law and, with a label like that, hard to criticize in any way. 
This posed a challenge to the professional acronym-creators at the Pentagon, home of fate (Fuse Arming Test Equipment, though often embarrassingly confused with a different program, Female Acceleration Tolerance Enhancement). Within that Puzzle Palace, an accidental acronym was formed when the phrase Global War on Terrorism became popular among military briefers and point-sheet writers. This group of words was initialized, as is the custom with all Department of Defense phrases; unfortunately, it produced gwot, universally pronounced with a rising inflection as "Gee-what?" The image it projects is of a brass hat scratching his head, however, which is why the phrase may be dropped from internal d.o.d. communications. 
More recently, the Students for Global Justice and other opponents of globalization who demonstrated peacefully at the World Economic Forum in New York were organized under the banner of the Anti-Capitalist Convergence. However, the initials a.c.c. hold no meaning for anyone, and capitalism is not the dirty word it used to be. To deal with questions raised by the bigwigs huddling in the Waldorf-Astoria, anarchists, Marxists and other image-makers converged to create International answer. The title is an acronym of Act Now to Stop War and End Racism. Executives inside the Waldorf suspected that the demonstrators created the title to fit the word.
Some acronyms are standing the test of time. In 1960, as optical scientists were studying maser -- from Microwave Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation -- along came the bright idea of amplifying a highly coherent beam of light, promptly dubbed a laser. (Tangent: Will somebody explain to me why every focus is now laser-focused? Lasers can guide, ignite, heat, drive and print, but focus? This is the hottest compound adjective around today, leaving all other focuses fuzzy. In Enron's 2000 annual report, the company claimed to be "laser-focused on earnings per share," at which point I should have become suspicious. End of tangent; this column is determinedly laser-unfocused.)
In Jennet Conant's coming book, "Tuxedo Park," about a social setting in which key scientists worked during World War II, the origin of radar is recounted: United States Army scientists used r.p.f., for "radio position finding," while the British preferred r.d.f., for "radio direction finding." The Navy liked "radio detection and ranging," or radar, which the British accepted by 1943. That's a partial stump word, using a first syllable and then initials; a purer stump word is hazmats, familiar to drivers of trucks containing nitroglycerine and similarly hazardous materials. 
A pure acronym -- nimby, "not in my backyard" -- long ago took hold among zoning lawyers and environmentalists. madd -- Mothers Against Drunk Driving -- has become well known, spoofed by dam, Mothers Against Dyslexia. 
The recent spate of acronymania (and do not write that as acronymphomania) can be combated only by resolute ridicule. A cartoon in Punch showed marchers under a banner titled cocoa, the Council to Outlaw Contrived and Outrageous Acronyms. This was topped by Jack Rosenthal's satire in The New York Times calling for the Action Committee to Reform Our Nation's Youth Morals.

COLD CASE SQUAD
What has become of Chandra Levy? The question about this missing person is triggered by the F.B.I.'s grim refusal to accept the phrase Cold Case squad.
Last summer, before the nation's attention turned away from the vanished Congressional aide, Jim Stewart, a CBS reporter, said that "the F.B.I. officially transferred the Chandra Levy investigation to its Cold Case unit, which has historically handled only the toughest of cases that have few clues. . . . Cold case means cold leads, few tips and little to go on."
The F.B.I. responded with an angry news release referring proudly to its Major Case squad and coldly noting, "It is not correct to call this squad the 'Cold Case' squad."
Following this up, I was informed by an F.B.I. spokesman: "It has always been the Major Case squad. Cold Case squad is used by the media, not by us. The squad that we have in our office is called the Major Case Homicide squad. We do not call it a Cold Case squad."
And as for you journalists who don't accept our official law enforcement terminology -- freeze!

Unemployed Once, Twice . . .

BYLINE:  By NEAL GOMBERG; Neal Gomberg is a creative director who lives in Chappaqua.

 BODY:
LAST September, I joined the swelling ranks of the unemployed. I didn't actually keep a diary of my experiences, but would have had I thought of it. Nevertheless, all of the following is true.
 Tuesday, Sept. 4, 2001. Returned to work after a long, relaxing Labor Day weekend. Had just started writing ads for a new business pitch (the United States military account), when Greg entered my office, closed the door and delivered the bad news: he had to let me go. (Only in America can you salute the country's work force on Monday and be asked to leave it on Tuesday.) Greg insisted that it had nothing to do with my job performance, that I, along with more than 80 other people, was a victim of the "numbers." He wore a genuinely pained expression. So did I. 
 Wednesday, Sept. 5, 2001. Spent most of the day appreciating whoever it was who invented severance.
Friday, Sept. 7, 2001. In my new position of ex-employee, I showed Greg my final piece of ad copy. It was a bit awkward, so I resorted to gallows humor by quipping, "Hey, if the client doesn't like it, you can always say you fired the writer."
Friday, Sept. 14, 2001. I've been granted permission to use my office indefinitely. Since Sept. 11, I've been sitting at my desk, fighting off shock, fear and the urge to look for a job because to do so would be insensitive and disrespectful. Even for someone in advertising. The United States military has more important things to do (and no longer has an image problem), so the new business pitch was postponed.
Wednesday, Sept. 19, 2001. Greg entered my office and delivered good news: I was rehired. Not permanently, but who's hired permanently anymore? Here's how Greg explained it: he needed my help on the United States military pitch and I needed a job, so what the heck. 
Thursday, Sept. 20, 2001. Returned to work in my unusual position of "unemployed new employee." Everyone seemed happy to have me back. I was happy too, even though it would be bad form to complain about my job.
Thursday, Oct. 4, 2001. Called a headhunter who said it was so dead out there that she was closing her doors. Question: Who do headhunters call when they're out of work?
Friday, Oct. 12, 2001. Not very motivated to look for a job. Could it have something to do with the fact that there aren't any? I've called all my contacts and every last one of them said: "Not only are there no openings, we're laying people off."
Friday, Oct. 19, 2001. Had just completed my work on the United States military pitch when Greg entered my office and told me for the second time in six weeks, that he had to let me go.
Saturday, Nov. 3, 2001. Had a dream in which I did such a good job after being laid off that they named me "Ex-Employee of the Month."
Friday, Dec. 14, 2001. When I'm working I wish I had more spare time. Now that I have nothing but spare time, I wish I had something else: an income. I continue to make calls, but there's still nothing out there. Oh well. Not landing a job when there aren't any has to be better than not landing a job when there are dozens of them.
Tuesday, Feb. 19, 2002. The totally unexpected happened: I got a job. A good job. I start next week. I'm lucky to have gotten a job when there aren't any. I'm lucky I've been able to eat while I've been unemployed. I'm also lucky to have had the continuing support of my wife and two daughters, who are pleased, not just because I landed a job, but because I'll be spending less time at home. Finally, after giving it some serious thought, I'm prepared to make one positive statement about my unemployment experience: it ended.

Number of Million-Dollar Home Sales Rose in 2001

BYLINE:  By ELSA BRENNER

 BODY:
ALTHOUGH Westchester's luxury housing market staggered at times in 2001 under the weight of a national economic recession and the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, it still finished the year somewhat ahead of the previous year after a spike in sales activity during the fourth quarter.
 According to numbers from the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service -- which represents more than 500 real estate offices having listings in Westchester, Putnam and Dutchess Counties -- 578 million-dollar homes in Westchester changed hands in 2001, up by 7 percent from 539 in 2000. The service said it had not compiled the total dollar value of the sales. 
 The 7 percent increase, however, falls short of the performance in the past several years, when percentage increases for volume were in the double digits, figures from the listing service show. For example, the 539 luxury homes sold in 2000 represented a 31 percent increase over 1999. And in 1999, the 410 homes that sold for $1 million or more represented a 33 percent increase over the previous year's total of 308. 
Anthony P. Cutugno, executive vice president in charge of luxury sales for Houlihan/Lawrence, said that during the first eight months of last year, sales activity in the luxury home market was sluggish. Then, after the terrorist attacks in late summer, he said, there was an eight-week period during which the real estate market almost came to a halt.
"But then the activity suddenly picked up, and the fourth quarter of 2001 ended up being very strong, especially in the very high end of the luxury category," said Mr. Cutugno, whose agency operates 25 offices in Westchester, Putnam and southern Dutchess Counties.
Some real estate agents were pleased that despite the difficulties in 2001, there was still a 7 percent climb in luxury sales. But others cautioned that the number may give a deceptively rosy impression -- especially if one factors in the effects of what P. Gilbert Mercurio, the executive director of the Westchester County Board of Realtors, called "bracket creep.
In its year-end summary of real estate activity, the Board of Realtors reported that the median price of a single-family house in 2001 rose to $449,900 -- $42,900, or 10.5 percent, more than the median a year earlier.
"Therefore, if a house was selling for $900,000 in 2000, it would probably be selling for a million in 2001," Mr. Mercurio said, explaining bracket creep. "One has to consider that when looking at any increase in sales of luxury homes." 
Figures from the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service, a subsidiary of the Westchester County Board of Realtors and the Putnam County Association of Realtors, showed that only 14 homes priced $4 million and over sold in 2001 in Westchester, compared with 21 homes in that category in 2000 -- demonstrating a weakness the very high end of the luxury market.. 
Joseph Valvano, managing broker for Coldwell Banker Ye Village Realty in Dobbs Ferry, attributed the decline in the sales of high-end luxury homes to caution of the part of buyers who were directly affected by the downturn in the stock market. But he said that the persistent lack of inventory -- which was plaguing all sectors of the Westchester residential real estate market -- was still resulting in a seller's market.
Susan Greenberg, a sales associate specializing in luxury homes for Julia B. Fee in Scarsdale, observed that bidding wars on the more desirable homes -- older homes that had been tastefully renovated and were in excellent condition, for example -- still took place last year, indicating that even though the market was slower, it was still healthy.
In general, the most sought-after luxury homes have large bathrooms, family rooms, luxury master baths with many closets and large kitchens, Mrs. Greenberg said. If a house languishes on the market, she added, it is usually because the property is priced too high.
The Multiple Listing Service showed that 24 homes sold for $3 million to $4 million in 2001; 79 properties sold in the $2 million to $3 million range; and 461 homes sold in the $1 million to $2 million category.
LAST year's sales of more than $1 million continued a trend observed in 2000: a spread into communities other than Scarsdale, Rye, Bedford and Bronxville, the localities traditionally associated with luxury sales. 
Until two years ago, for example, no homes had sold for more than $1 million in the Croton area. "Now, the $1 million mark is frequently being surpassed there," Houlihan/Lawrence reported. It sold Rolling Stone Farm, a 100-plus acre estate in the Croton area, for more than $4 million, and Long Vue, the former home of Gloria Swanson, for more than $1.5 million.
Houlihan/Lawrence, which has two high-end marketing divisions, also reported that during 2001, the luxury market continued expanding into Putnam County, especially Garrison and Cold Spring along the Hudson River. As recently as five years ago, there were no sales in excess of $1 million in all of Putnam, according to the agency, which operates one of its high-end divisions in conjunction with Sotheby's International Realty, and the other through its own Luxury Country Properties program.
Still, the most frequently listed postal addresses for $1 million-plus home sales in 2001, according to the Multiple Listing Service, continued to be Scarsdale, where 86 homes sold for $1 million and more, followed by Rye, where 80 were sold. Next on the list was Bedford with 52, followed by Harrison with 41, and then Armonk, with 36. In Chappaqua, 34 were sold; in Bronxville, 34; in Larchmont, 28; in Purchase 27; and in Pound Ridge, 23.
The highest priced home to sell last year was in Bedford for $8.5 million.
The highest-priced property still on the market in Westchester is Stonwin Farm, the family estate in Scarsdale of the noted jeweler Harry Winston, listed at $18 million.
Others on the market include: Rose Briar Hill, overlooking the Hudson River in Briarcliff, which is listed for $5.7 million; Manursing Island Manor in Rye -- which was built in 1916 for George Jay Gould, the son of railroad tycoon Jay Gould -- at $5.9 million; and Greenfields, a classic Georgian manor in Bedford, listed at $5.925 million.
Real estate agents said buyers of luxury homes represented all age groups and tended to be professionals and celebrities. Some buyers were moving from less expensive neighborhoods in Westchester to more exclusive communities, others were moving up to more expensive homes in the same communities and yet others were coming from New York City.
But Steven Meyers, president of Houlihan/Lawrence, said the surge in activity late in the year did not appear to validate a much-talked-about theory that residents of Manhattan would flee to relatively "safe havens" in the country.
F RANKLY, we saw virtually no sales emanate from people reacting to fears of terrorist attacks," he said. "The surge in sales in the fourth quarter was largely generated by a number of buyers who had been looking in the market for long periods of time who concluded that the prices and interest rates in the fourth quarter were conducive to buying."
Interest rates on mortgages as of mid-February were as low as 5.875 percent for a three-year adjustable-rate mortgage and as high as 7.125 percent for a 30-year mortgage of more than $300,700, according to the Manhattan Mortgage Company in Purchase.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/The Bronx; 
Prime Office Space Is Planned in Unlikely Sites

BYLINE:  By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
THE Bronx is not the first place most people would think of when looking for Class A office space. But two developers think the time may be ripe to entice tenants to the borough's lower rents, central location and good transportation links.
 Both plan to convert existing structures into modern office space with the power and telecommunications infrastructure that most tenants demand today. Both are doing preliminary work at their sites, but neither intends to proceed further without signing an anchor tenant. Both claim to have deals close to signing. 
 The Simone Development Company of New Rochelle has already attracted attention -- not all of it welcome -- with its plans to convert part of the former Bronx Developmental Center, a onetime state mental health facility, into offices and, if demand develops from biotechnology companies, laboratory space. The company has begun demolishing the interior of the 330,000-square-foot building and plans to modify the saw-toothed outer walls to produce a squared-off shape containing 450,000 square feet of space.
This has brought outcries from preservationists, who have bemoaned any change to the building, which was designed by Richard Meier and which features elongated porthole windows and an aluminum-colored skin.
Although the AIA Guide to New York calls the building "a consummate work of architecture," the fact that it has sat empty for several years demonstrates that its layout is inefficient for most uses, said Joseph Simone, the president of Simone Development. "The floor plates do not work for anything except maybe a dormitory and psychiatric center," he said. "We are squaring off the building to eliminate the saw-tooth."
He also plans to eliminate the porthole windows and replace them with rectangular office windows and to replace the aluminum-colored outer skin with white aluminum panels.
Mr. Simone said the 350,000-square-foot building is to be the first phase at the 18.5-acre site, which he bought from the state of New York last May for $3.7 million. The state still owns part of the original tract, which has other buildings on it. Depending on demand, up to 1 million square feet of space could be built at the Simone site, which is near the Hutchinson River Parkway in the Pelham Bay section of the Bronx. The complex will be known as the Hutchinson Metro Center.
"Joe Simone is spending massive amounts of money" on the conversion, said Steve Kane, a broker with the Tamerlane Realty Corporation, who specializes in Bronx properties. He said prospective tenants for new developments in the area, in addition to private business, could come from such public institutions as colleges and hospitals. He said what little modern office space exists in the Bronx is already occupied. "There's no space to lease," he said.
Other brokers noted that the Bronx had recently been attractive to retail developers recently, with Home Depot, Pathmark and Target Stores planning or building large projects in the borough.
Not far away, in the East Tremont section of the borough, a building that formerly housed the warehouse and distribution center for the Loehmann's clothing stores is also being offered for redevelopment into modern office space. The developer is a joint venture of the Dedona Contracting Corporation, an area builder, and the Westchester Creek Corporation, which has a long-term lease on about 18 acres of land in the area as a result of an urban development program dating back to the Lindsay administration.
LOEHMANN'S has relocated its warehousing and distribution operations to northern New Jersey, but is planning to keep its headquarters and buying offices in the building, which is at 2500 Halsey Street, said Joseph Dedona of Dedona Construction. He said Loehmann's would occupy 40,000 square feet of space at one end of the 152,000-square-foot building, unlike its current situation, where the offices are spread out around the structure. Loehmann's will continue to own the building, said Arnold Spellun, a lawyer who is the principal owner of Westchester Creek.
If another substantial tenant signs a lease, the joint venture is prepared to convert the rest of the warehouse into one-story, high-ceiling office space. "We have Loehmann's," Mr. Dedona said. "One more tenant and we're ready to go."
In addition to converting the existing building, the developer is prepared to build a new structure of five or six stories next to it if demand warrants. The addition could swell the project into a total of 389,000 square feet of space.
One attraction of office space in the Bronx for tenants is lower rents than Manhattan and some parts of the suburbs. Annual rents for prime space in the borough range from "the high $20's to low $30's" a square foot, according to Mark A. Jaccom, an executive vice president of Julien J. Studley, a brokerage that generally represents tenants but is working in this case for the developer.
Mr. Jaccom said the East Tremont location could prove attractive to companies seeking to improve their security by spreading their operations over several locations because of the good subway, bus and highway links to other parts of the city.
Economic incentives from the city -- mostly property tax abatements -- make the area attractive to developers. "I have office buildings in Westchester County, and I know you cannot cover the costs of new construction there," Mr. Dedona said. "In the city, with the incentives, you can cover the cost of construction. Besides, there is almost no Class A space available here."
The city has been trying for decades to foster economic development in the area, according to Mr. Spellun. "During the Lindsay administration, the city set up the Zerega Avenue industrial urban renewal project, which still exists." About 100 acres of land, then covered with scrap yards and auto body shops, were acquired by condemnation, he said. The Westchester Creek company, named after an inlet of water off the East River that comes within 25 yards of the Loehmann's property, took a 90-year lease on its share of the assembled property.
"One of the problems with redevelopment in the city is getting big chunks of land," Mr. Spellun said. "This was similar to what the city did in College Point," an area in northern Queens.
He said a building in the eastern Bronx would be attractive for its low costs compared with Manhattan and some suburbs, the access to a nearby work force and the good transportation links. "The Cross Bronx, New England Expressway, Hutchinson and Bruckner all intersect within 300 yards of here," he said.
And the image of the Bronx as a place with a high level of crime is outdated, Mr. Kane said. "Loehmann's ran a two shift operation here," and employees walked several blocks at night to the nearest subway stop, he said.

HEADLINE: Deciding Whether To Make a Home Near Ground Zero 

BYLINE:  By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
THE Reynolds family has a choice to make, and Mary Reynolds is of two minds. Part of her wants to move permanently out of the Gateway Plaza development at Battery Park City, taking advantage of the owner's offer to let any tenant leave by March 31 with no financial penalty for breaking the lease. 
 But another part of her wants to stay. She has lived in Gateway for 12 years and is raising four daughters there. She considers it a community. 
 "I never felt fully safe here after the '93 bombing at the trade center," Mrs. Reynolds said, "and after Sept. 11 people said I was crazy to come back. But this is a very special place. We were a neighborhood. We had a park, a promenade, a river and sailing on the river. It was safe. The children could be independent at an early age. I still don't know what we'll do." 
Ambivalence about staying or leaving is a persistent refrain among many of the families in Battery Park City's two residential neighborhoods, the North and South, after the catastrophe at the World Trade Center close by on Sept. 11. Brokers and building owners report that in several buildings over 25 percent of the tenants have moved away permanently since then. Others have come back, sometimes to different apartments. Many seem to be uncertain about how long they will stay.
But for those dedicated to the future of Battery Park City, the emphasis now is on restoring, rebuilding and reoccupying, on getting the nation's largest master-planned in-city community back on track. Whatever the decision of long-term tenants, it is the new arrivals who are providing the most optimistic outlook and perhaps the more patient attitude about the area's future.
Last week, the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, a governmental agency formed in November by the governor and the mayor, proposed grants totaling $200 million to people committed to staying in lower Manhattan or moving there for at least two years. Earlier, the Battery Park City Authority announced its own incentive program for residents, totaling $15.6 million.
It was not clear last week whether the benefit under the authority's program would be deducted from the larger benefit anticipated under the development corporation's proposed program. Leasing agents expect the new incentives to stimulate rental activity. 
There are 6,400 apartments at Battery Park City, 4,200 of them in pure-rental buildings, many recently completed in the North neighborhood, which builders call TriBeCa West. The rest of the apartments, 2,200 of them, are in condominium buildings in the South neighborhood. 
Many of these are occupied by their owners, who by and large have stayed put since Sept. 11. But others are held by outside investors, who rent them out to corporations and individuals. As in other rentals, vacancies are above normal, with some condominium owners resorting to short-term leases as well as lower rents to bolster income.
The apartments that sustained the most blast and smoke damage in the attack were in Gateway, in the center of Battery Park City between the two major residential neighborhoods. It is the largest and oldest of the developments, with 1,700 rental apartments in a six-building complex built and owned by the Lefrak Organization.
Market rents for vacancies had reached $2,800 for some mid-level one-bedrooms and $3,700 for two-bedrooms by last September. Average rents are down roughly 20 percent, according to Lefrak executives. 
The occupancy includes many long-term tenants with school-aged children. The Lefrak Organization says that 30 percent of the tenants have either left for good already or have notified management that they intend to.
Explanations for departures are not hard to find. Some leave because of dissatisfaction with air quality and other environmental factors, and doubt over when or whether normalcy can be restored. Others leave because of job losses or relocations. Many are unwilling to put up with inconveniences of uncertain duration, or they are disheartened by the disruption of community life and the departure of friends. The very trauma of the events of Sept. 11 was enough to keep some away.
In the weeks after Sept. 11 prospective new renters came mainly in search of bargains. They found them. In many cases apartments went to people relatively unfamiliar not only with Battery Park City but also with downtown itself. Rents for vacant apartments were down by 20 to 25 percent, rental agents say, and in some cases as much as 30 percent after negotiations. More recently they report reductions from pre-September market rates are closer to 15 to 25 percent, depending on the building.
At a building called Tribeca Pointe in the North neighborhood, Douglas Babbin and his fiancee, Elizabeth Cook, rented a 12th-floor two-bedroom two-bath apartment overlooking the Hudson River in December. The rent was $3,450 a month, down from $3,800 for the previous tenant.
"We had been trying to find something reasonable since last May," said Mr. Babbin, a 44-year-old financial adviser who had been living in Murray Hill. "We checked Battery Park City but didn't think we could get a good deal. Then after Sept. 11 rents went down drastically and we saw a good opportunity."
With so many apartments available, the couple was able to shop the market without feeling under pressure to make a decision quickly or risk losing the apartment, Mr. Babbin said. "There was breathing room to evaluate all the apartments that were available."
AT another North neighborhood building, Tribeca Bridge Tower, leasing agents said that last summer one-bedrooms were renting for $2,500 to $2,800, two-bedrooms for $3,700 to $4,900, and three-bedrooms for $5,300 to $6,200. After Sept. 11, new tenants were negotiating deals at 25 to 30 percent below former rents, said Stephen V. Maschi, the leasing director. Current rents for vacant apartments are 15 to 20 percent below the market rents before Sept. 11, he said.
Tribeca Bridge Tower is a three-year-old project with 150 apartments rising above an elementary and intermediate school. Between 40 and 50 tenants left for good after September, Mr. Maschi said. To induce others to stay on, a rent abatement was offered, averaging 20 percent for 20 months, ending May 31 of next year. 
At a building in the South neighborhood called Liberty View, Dorota Orczyk and her husband, Shane Ojar, decided that even a direct view of the trade-center site was no disincentive to renting. Three weeks ago the couple took a two-bedroom apartment on the 19th floor, with a bird's-eye view of the site looking north from one bedroom. They left a $2,400-a-month one-bedroom near Gramercy Park and rented a two-bedroom one-bath apartment for $2,250.
"We have always liked the area," said Ms. Orczyk, who expects her first child next month. "The view doesn't bother us. It's amazing to see the progress being made every day."
But recovery requires more than lower rents. The public will ultimately have to be reassured on environmental safety and air quality, owners and leasing agents say. Economic revival downtown is also necessary.
Tenant satisfaction will be affected as well by the speed and efficiency with which the Battery Park City Authority succeeds in restoring public amenities and ease of access to the entire 92-acre site. At present north-to-south traffic on West Street, both pedestrian and vehicular, is closed off from Chambers Street to the entrance to the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel, making it awkward for residents to drive or walk to destinations outside Battery Park City itself.
Much of the major restoration and improvement work on public spaces will get under way in March and April, said Timothy S. Carey, president of the authority. Construction of a temporary bridge over West Street at Rector Street is scheduled to start April 1, with completion four to six weeks later. In early April an emergency high-tension electric wire that now runs across the property is to be removed, clearing the way for repairs to streets, curbs, sidewalks and the esplanade along the river, as well as the restoration of normal north and south pedestrian traffic within Battery Park City.
The delayed construction of a 1.9-acre park, tentatively named Teardrop Park, in the North neighborhood is to begin in April. Even earlier, in March, reconstruction is to start on the ball fields that were commandeered for heavy rescue equipment after the attack. A United Artists theater with 16 screens will reopen in April or May, Mr. Carey said, and a closed Embassy Suites hotel is also scheduled to reopen in May.
Another incentive to tenants to stay, and for new tenants to move in, is a $15.6 million disaster relief package that the authority said earlier this month had been authorized by the governor, the mayor and the city comptroller. The amount that will paid roughly equals three months of payments due to the authority for land rent, payments that the authority passes on to the city in lieu of property taxes, and other fees.
Residents in the pure-rental buildings could start receiving checks as early as June of this year, Mr. Carey said. New tenants arriving before July 1 will also be eligible for these payments. In the pure-rental buildings this averages $1,846 an apartment, but the actual amount per apartment will differ depending upon how the charges are apportioned by owners to apartments of differing characteristics. When individuals are named on the lease, payments will go directly from the authority to the tenant. The method of dealing with corporate entities has not been decided.
In the condominiums the benefit would average $2,850 an apartment. As of last week no final determination had been made on how the money would be dispersed. The direct beneficiary presumably could be the owner, whether a resident or an outside investor, or it could be resident-owners only and lessees of the apartments, whether a corporation or an individual, in the case of nonresident owners.
One of the knottiest real-estate problems arising out of the drop in apartment rents in Battery Park City involves these condominiums. There are 11 of them, out of a total 27 residential buildings, counting the six-building Gateway complex as one building. Not only ownership but also leasing management is dispersed.
Because of the economic downturn, renting was weak even before Sept. 11. A survey in late January by Empire State Properties, a brokerage that handles the leasing for many investor-owners, found the overall vacancy rate in the condominiums to be 28 percent. 
TEN of the condominium buildings began a "rent strike" in September, withholding from the authority payments due for land rent, payments in lieu of property taxes and other fees. The 11th condominium, Hudson View West, was barred from taking this step by a court settlement in a lawsuit over nonpayment of these charges in the 90's. At least 60 apartments are operated on a rental basis in Hudson View West, Empire State Properties said. The building has 108 apartments.
"The decline in rental income has been a disaster for our condominiums," said Eugene Glazer, chairman of the Battery Park City Homeowners Coalition and a retired financial consultant who has been the owner-occupant of a condominium in the Regatta, on South End Avenue, since 1989. Investor-owners are not collecting the revenue they need to keep up with their expenses, said Mr. Glazer, who owns only the apartment in which he lives.
In discussions with the coalition the Battery Park City Authority has insisted that it has no authority to modify its charges, and it has notified the condominiums that it intends to pursue the full amount that it is owed -- about $13 million. However, the discussions are continuing, the authority said.
Another problem for a few condominiums arises from the leasing policy of some investor-owners. Weak demand for apartments compels them to offer ever-shorter lease terms, which itself becomes a management problem for the building and raises its operating expenses. "Short-term occupancy undermines the viability of residential condominiums," Mr. Glazer said. But forcing owners to make leases longer in a weak market could seriously damage the finances of some condominiums, owners say.
The Regatta, with 80 percent resident ownership, adopted strong measures against excessive short-term occupancy, including a cap of 7 percent on the number of apartments that can be owned by a single entity, Mr. Glazer said.
Even among investor owners there are distinctions. The largest among them is the Milstein Organization, the builder of four condominiums with 1,400 apartments in the South neighborhood. Milstein has sold many, but it still owns 575 condominiums. In one building, the 293-unit Liberty View, 150 apartments are furnished and rented out on leases running a minimum of one month. Milstein also manages these apartments. 
Other condominiums have more dispersed ownership, but no building-by-building breakdown of the percentage of resident as opposed to investor ownership is available. 
At the Cove Club condominium, Simone Wegge, an assistant professor of economics at the CUNY campus on Staten Island, and her husband, Victor Valdivia, who runs an investment research firm, bought a two-bedroom apartment at the Cove Club condominium for about $460,000 in the summer of 2000. They lived there for several months, then moved to a rental on Staten Island in March 2001 after Ms. Wegge took her present job.
"We rented out our apartment on a six-month lease for a rent that was high enough to cover our costs," Ms. Wegge said. "But in November rents were down about 40 percent. We got a tenant for three months at a rent 35 percent below our previous rent. We were running a deficit of $1,500 a month. Then the tenant moved and now the apartment is vacant."
In pure-rental buildings, many of the rent reductions for existing tenants were agreed upon in negotiations with tenant associations. One lawyer, Jack L. Lester, said he represented associations in eight downtown buildings, including four at Battery Park City. The settlements reached ranged from reductions of 20 percent to 30 percent, depending upon the amount of damage a building sustained. Reductions run from four months to as long as two years. Once the reduction expires, the rent goes back to the previous rent, which becomes the base for calculating future increases.
Mr. Lester said that he still has three open cases in Battery Park City -- 50 and 70 Battery Park Place and 333 Rector Place. About a third of the tenants are withholding rent those buildings, he said.
At Gateway, the Lefrak Organization had to undertake a major reconstruction job, especially in Building 600, which had significant damage. Apartments there could not be occupied for three months. The eastern face of Building 600 is not scheduled to reopen until April or May.
Gateway tenants were charged no rent while they could not occupy, and they were given 30 days of free rent from the time the owner declared their building ready for occupancy. Tenants who had been paying less than Sept. 11 market rents were also given a rent credit of 15 percent, lasting for one year from the end of the free-rent period and calculated on their September rent. 
The rent credit was an inducement for long-term tenants to come back. For newer tenants, who were paying closer to the market rent last September, rents were adjusted to put them in line with the schedule adopted for new leases after Sept. 11, which is approximately 20 percent lower than the one used previously. In the new schedule rents on the middle floors of the buildings average $1,500 a month for studios, $1,900 for one-bedrooms and $3,000 for two-bedrooms, but specific rents may vary greatly from the average based on the floor, the exposure and the building itself.
UNDER an agreement reached in 1995 and running until 2005, tenants in occupancy when the agreement started get lease-renewal increases that follow the guidelines of the rent-stabilization system. Currently, these increases are 4 percent on a one-year lease and 6 percent on a two-year lease. Tenants at Gateway pay free-market rents on their initial lease and guideline increases on renewal. The system applies regardless of the level of the initial rent.
The leasing agent for new tenants at Gateway is Empire State Properties, whose principals, Suzanne Miller and Deborah Hildreth, are longtime Gateway tenants themselves. Their company has handled condominium rentals in Battery Park City for seven years. It was hired by the Lefrak Organization in December, and it has leased out 160 apartments to new arrivals since then.
The typical new Gateway renter is a single person or a couple with no children, Ms. Miller said. "The overwhelming number of vacancies were in our studios and one-bedrooms," she said. "I myself know 10 families who had to move their children to two different schools in the weeks after Sept. 11, and now they don't want to move them a third time to come back to P.S. 89." P.S. 89, in a new building in the North neighborhood, is scheduled to reopen on Thursday; the intermediate school in the same building reopened in January.
Many of the new arrivals are graduate students who plan to stay one to four years, Ms. Miller said. Only six of the new arrivals have school-age children. The average age of new tenants is 30.
A total of 180 Gateway tenants have moved to different apartments within Gateway itself, taking advantage of vacancies to improve their housing situation. Others have moved elsewhere in Battery Park City. Among the latter is Enzo Bono and his family -- his wife, Tina, and their daughters Nicole, 11, and Elisa, 5. Their two-bedroom $3,200-a-month apartment in Building 600 overlooked the trade center site.
In January the Bonos rented a two-bedroom apartment on the eighth floor of 22 River Terrace, a Rockrose Development Corporation building along the river, and converted it to a three-bedroom. The view is to the northwest. The rent is no higher than they paid before -- $3,200 a month.
The couple has been living in Battery Park City since 1987. "I like the location," said Mr. Bono, who works in the freight-forwarding business at Kennedy International Airport. "I didn't feel like running away. Once the reconstruction starts, everything should get back to normal. Eventually I will look to buy."

HEADLINE: 'It Takes a Lot of Courage To Do Something New' 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM J. HOLSTEIN 

 BODY:
 SHIRA P. WHITE contends that American companies need to be more creative, yet one company she wrote about, Enron, took creativity to a level that proved its downfall. In an interview, she spoke about striking the right creative balance. WILLIAM J. HOLSTEIN

Q. Did Enron's executives cross the line from creativity to something else?

A. The jury is still out about what they actually did. They may have done illegal things and they may have done immoral things, but they may also have had some good ideas. I think we should separate out the good ideas from the bad things and see if they have some application. There is a really big difference between creativity and illegality.

Q. Is true innovation still occurring despite all the bad things that have happened in the economy?

A. Yes, I believe so and really hope so. Now it's even more important for people and companies to be creative and to get creative about the tight spots they're in. The worse the economy, the more creative you have to be.

Q. Why aren't American companies more creative in what you consider the right kind of way?

A. For most companies, it hasn't been a priority. They don't screen employees on the basis of creativity. Their systems are not designed for creativity, but rather efficiency.

Q. Do you think executives manage too much by the numbers?

A. Yes, it is largely numbers-oriented. Even on a psychological level, people are resistant to creativity. People don't want to rock the boat or make waves. It's easier to do it the way it's always been done. It takes a lot of courage to do something new.

Q. You wrote that the average corporate brainstorming session doesn't really work. Why doesn't it?

A. Most of the time, it doesn't work because in most organizations, it's an isolated activity. They'll call a brainstorming session, bring in a facilitator, sit around for an afternoon and come up with all sorts of ideas. But the ideas aren't based on any preparation. Then, afterward, people go back to their offices and nothing ever happens. The ideas collect dust.

Q. What's wrong with the innovation process at most companies, then?

A. Most companies don't even have one. If you walk into 90 percent of organizations and ask, "Do you have an innovation process?" the answer would be no. You'd get puzzled looks.

Q. Now that the technology bubble has popped, some people think that America's most innovative days are gone. Do you?

A. I don't think our creative juices are shot. Do we have more creative days ahead of us? I think so. There is certainly higher awareness for the need for higher creativity and innovation than ever before.

HEADLINE: ON POLITICS; 
What Goes Around Comes Around -- Including Blame

BYLINE:  By David Kocieniewski; David Kocieniewski is Trenton bureau chief for The New York Times.

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
It's only been a month since James E. McGreevey assumed the throne of New Jersey politics, but already the state Republicans are shocked -- shocked! -- at the shrill sound of partisanship emanating from the Governor's lips.
 After spending the campaign assailing Republicans who controlled Trenton for 10 years for their borrowing and spending, Mr. McGreevey has devoted much of his first few months in the limelight, well, assailing Republicans for borrowing and spending. 
 His inaugural address was peppered with pointed references to the "irresponsible borrowing and runaway spending" of his predecessors. His budget address expanded on that theme to describe the Republican reign as "a failure of will, a failure of courage, a failure of leadership." 
Mr. McGreevey's aides have conducted so many news conferences to remind New Jerseyeans his predecessors created the state's budget mess that it wouldn't be surprising to find that he had changed the state symbol to a pointed index finger, with the motto "They Did It!"
Not surprisingly, the "they" Mr. McGreevey refers to, are not amused. Assemblywoman Rose Heck has accused the Governor of "trying to beat up" on her and fellow Republicans. Joseph Kyrillos, State Republican chairman, has repeatedly exhorted the Governor to stop the "campaign rhetoric." The Senate co-president, John O. Bennett, has compared the governor to Chicken Little and urged him to mute the partisan insults before they hinder attempts to solve the state's budget problems. 
This newfound Republican pacifism might be slightly more persuasive if the party hadn't spent the past decade blasting Democrats for the sins of Jim Florio. Governor Florio, you may recall, was elected in 1989 and quickly pushed a through a tax increase that led angry voters to cast Democrats into exile for nearly a decade. 
Mr. McGreevey's victory in November took some of the sting out of that charge. But don't be fooled; the specter of the Florio tax hike and its ensuing electoral disaster still hang heavy over Mr. McGreevey's head. During the campaign, Bret Schundler, the Republican candidate, badgered Mr. McGreevey for weeks about taxes, until Mr. McGreevey finally made a promise not to increase taxes. 
Since taking office, he's been desperately trying to make himself some wiggle room on the issue by explaining that he only promised not to raise the sales or income tax. That way, if the economic downturn forces him to enact a tax increase, Mr. McGreevey can at least defend himself against charges that he broke his promise. But either way, he knows that any increase will give Republicans ammunition to attack him as the second coming of Florio.
That's the trouble with mudslinging. Voters tell pollsters they hate it. Politicians insist they abhor it. Often, though, an attack ad or a biting retort can be highly effective. 
The trick is knowing how far to push your criticism and how long your charges will resonate. But it is, at best, an inexact science, because there is no statute of limitations for political blame. 
Some tribal societies still wage wars to avenge grudges from past centuries past. Middle Eastern political leaders stoke anti-American sentiment by invoking the Crusaders, even though the Crusades ended hundreds of years before the American Declaration of Independence. 
Here at home, attention spans tend to be shorter, forcing political combatants to focus on the more immediate past. During the presidential primary of 2000, for instance, Senator John McCain was able to present himself as the candidate who would end the influence of big money in politics. Never mind that in 1991 Mr. McCain was rebuked by the Senate ethics committee as one of the Keating Five -- a group of senators who intervened with federal regulators on behalf of Charles Keating, a political donor who owned a troubled savings and loan and was eventually jailed for fraud. In modern presidential politics, that was apparently ancient history.
As Mr. McGreevey begins his term, he'll have to gauge very carefully how long the public will allow him to blame Republicans for the pain his budget cuts are certain to inflict. Conventional wisdom among New Jersey Democrats is that Mr. Florio compounded the anger about his tax increase by failing to prepare the public for it adequately . So Mr. McGreevey's carping about the budget woes, and his constant reminders that the debt was run up while Republicans were in power, can be seen as a very vocal attempt to avoid repeating that mistake. 
But the governor must also be careful not to pound Republican leaders so hard that he completely alienates them. Although Democrats control the Assembly and have a 20-20 split in the Senate, the bad medicine in Mr. McGreevey's coming budget will be much easier for the public to swallow if it is approved by a bipartisan vote in the Legislature. If the state resorts to tax increases during Mr. McGreevey's tenure, which some Democrats fear is likely, that, too, would be made more politically palatable by a few Republican votes. 
For now, the Governor can revel in the fact that there is only one real megaphone in New Jersey politics, and it belongs to whoever is governor.
He'd do well to remember, however, that during all the years the Republicans were ridiculing Jim Florio, they never needed to ask him for his vote.

Insurers Find Profit in a New Risk Consciousness

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
THE insurance industry has long depended on fear of the unforeseen. Lately, the unforeseen has created a boom for a type of insurance coverage that has been around for years -- protection from political turmoil.
 Events of the last six months -- from the World Trade Center attacks and the United States war on terrorism to the economic crisis in Argentina -- have jolted multinational companies into remembering that the world is a dangerous place to do business. 
 Many American corporations with overseas operations have been rushing to buy special insurance to protect themselves not only against terrorism, riots, civil war, strikes and coups d'etat, but also against nationalization and government interference with the flow of profits back home.
"There's a new risk consciousness," said John M. Minor, a senior executive at Aon, one of the largest commercial insurance brokers. "It's a different attitude, maybe a sense of vulnerability, that we didn't have before Sept. 11." 
At some insurance companies, sales have doubled for what is known as political risk coverage. Patricia L. Skold, in charge of such insurance at the Chubb Group, said it had received 1,500 applications for coverage in the last six months, up from an estimated 750 in the comparable period a year earlier.
Companies that had never bought the specialized coverage are now signing up; others are expanding coverage. In many cases, terrorism coverage previously was included in general property policies at little or no extra charge. But now many property insurers are refusing to provide terrorism coverage in that way, meaning that corporations must buy it separately or as part of a political risk package.
One big pharmaceutical company had been operating around the world for years without political risk coverage. But in November, Mr. Minor said, it paid $1 million for $70 million in coverage on its plants and sales offices in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia and Peru. He said it was considering extending the coverage to its operations in Asia.
Just last Tuesday, Ms. Skold said, a company that makes and installs telecommunications equipment in Africa completed a deal with Chubb to nearly triple its policy, to $30 million from $11 million.
Political risk coverage is one of the most expensive and, for insurers, one of the most profitable of products. For example, $50 million of comprehensive political risk coverage can easily cost $625,000 to $1.75 million a year, compared with $75,000 to $175,000 for the same amount of standard property and casualty coverage for international operations. The prices are high because the businesses that need the coverage are in intrinsically risky situations. Claims are rarely filed, but without such coverage, a corporation would be vulnerable to events that could wallop its bottom line. 
INSURERS calculate premiums based partly on what they call "country risk" -- an evaluation that considers factors like corruption and political unrest. Angola, where a civil war has simmered for decades, is considered a riskier country than South Africa, for example.
Insurers also look at the nature of the business to be insured, said Mr. Minor, who is in charge of political risk coverage at Aon. A chemical plant, he said, is a riskier proposition than a cannery; joint ventures with local partners are more likely to go wrong than businesses in which the foreign owner has more control; and high-technology companies are less likely to become targets for government takeover than some other businesses because their success depends upon highly skilled managers. These days, as the United States pursues Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden, countries like Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Yemen, Sudan and other Islamic nations top the insurers' list of risky places to do business.
Risks can rise unexpectedly because of events elsewhere. When President Bush labeled Iraq, Iran and North Korea an "axis of evil" in his State of the Union address, for example, many executives at American businesses abroad cringed.
"It just increased the uncertainty and nervousness," Mr. Minor said.
Insurers who specialize in political risk coverage say they also see a surge in a related coverage -- export credit insurance, which enables American corporations shipping goods abroad to collect the money they are owed even if their customers fail to pay.
In one such deal that reflected nervousness over Brazil's financial stability, the American International Group and a European insurer sold coverage to Embraer, the Brazilian aircraft manufacturer, on its purchase of $150 million worth of aircraft engines and avionics parts. Embraer paid for the insurance to protect its lender, a syndicate of banks led by J. P. Morgan Chase, in the event that an economic crisis in Brazil prevented Embraer from repaying the loan.
While Lloyds of London has been offering coverage on almost any peril for hundreds of years, political risk insurance began to be sold widely in the 1970's as American and European businesses rapidly expanded manufacturing and sales around the world, in search of low-cost labor and new markets. To encourage the international business, the United States set up the Overseas Private Investment Corporation to provide financing and insurance for American companies. But there was more work than it could handle, so in 1978, A.I.G. began offering political risk coverage. Now several units at Lloyds and half a dozen private insurers offer it. The World Bank, as well as some European governments, also provide the coverage.
UNLIKE most other types of insurance, political risk coverage grants ownership of the insured property to the insurance company if it must pay a claim. The insurer is then free to sell the property.
When that happens, said Ms. Skold at Chubb, insurers often cannot get back all they paid out. But, she said, the money they do recover adds significantly to an already very profitable line of business.
A.I.G., for example, became majority owner of a gold mine in Guadalcanal that an Australian company abandoned after civil war broke out in the Solomon Islands nearly two years ago. A.I.G. paid the mining company's claim under its $35 million policy and expects to sell its share of the mine. "We expect to achieve a substantial recovery," said John J. Salinger, president of A.I.G.'s political risk unit. 
Sometimes, insurers may need years to get their money back. In 1984, A.I.G. insured $25 million in logging equipment sold to a government agency in West Africa. A.I.G. said the government refused to pay, so the insurer paid its client and sought to recover the money. "We had to wait for a new government to come to power," Mr. Salinger said. "But when they did, we negotiated a repayment schedule." This year, he said, A.I.G. expects to receive the final payment.
Recovery of property and money can require negotiations with national governments. In many cases, that means talking to the chief of state. To increase its political influence, A.I.G. created a separate company for political risk coverage and recruited a board of high-profile former diplomats and government officials including Henry A. Kissinger; Richard C. Holbrooke, the former United States Ambassador to the United Nations; and Moeen Quereshi, who served briefly as the prime minister of Pakistan in the early 1990's.
The political risk insurance business has grown in spurts. "Every time there is a new crisis, demand goes up," Mr. Salinger said. 
But that is exactly the wrong time to buy insurance. "When the risk and demand go up simultaneously," Mr. Salinger said, "the rates go up, too."

HEADLINE: BOOK VALUE; 
Finding the Wellspring Of Corporate Creativity

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM J. HOLSTEIN 

 BODY:
DAVID DITZEL had a prestigious research job at Sun Microsystems in 1995 but was spending too much time in meetings that didn't matter much to him. "I didn't like where things were heading, and I didn't believe in the vision, so I became demotivated," he is quoted as saying in a new book. "I had to force myself to go off and think of something new." He quit his job and founded Transmeta, which has a radical new approach to making semiconductors.
 Mr. Ditzel is an example of a "hip, hot and happening" innovator, or "H3 ," portrayed in the book, "New Ideas About New Ideas: Insights on Creativity from the World's Leading Innovators," by Shira P. White, a New York-based consultant (Perseus Publishing, $26). The term H3 may make readers roll their eyes, as Ms. White acknowledges, but don't let the instant cliche deter you. Her book -- which she wrote with G. Patton Wright, whom she describes as a writing coach and mentor -- is filled with insight about the creative process and is presented most engagingly. It is precisely in these tough economic times, she contends, when innovation has a black eye because of the bursting of the dot-com bubble and the collapse of incubators like IdeaLab, that true innovators keep pushing ahead with a search for "leap innovation." 
 Much ink has been spilled on the topic of innovation, but Ms. White approaches the subject in a fresh way, partly because of her background and training. She had been a painter but decided to get a master's degree in business administration at New York University. Ms. White tells how she butted heads with one professor of management of information systems: The professor gave the class an assignment. Ms. White came up with a novel solution, but got a D. The reason, she remembers the professor saying, was that it wasn't the answer the professor was seeking. The business mind, it seemed to Ms. White, was closed to creative solutions. 
Since getting her degree, Ms. White has led something of a dual life. She has served as an instructor at the Pratt Institute and a lecturer at New York University's School of Visual Arts. She also started a consulting business, SPWI -- the letters are her initials, plus "I" for innovation -- which helps companies innovate. 
For "New Ideas," Ms. White interviewed a mix of 100 artists and sculptors and architects as well as business leaders at America Online, Corning, EMC, Enron, Genzyme, I.B.M. Research, ImClone Systems, Microsoft, Palm, Progressive Insurance and others.
Obviously, at least one of these companies has been too creative. Ms. White met and quotes Enron's former chairman, Kenneth L. Lay, and former chief executive, Jeffrey K. Skilling, discussing their pursuit of creative people for their staff and their expansion into new lines of business. She was able to adjust many of her references to Enron because much of the news about the company's collapse happened just before the book went to press this month. The fact remains, however, that the company was in many ways an innovator, coming up with a new market for trading commodities and for hedging, among other things. 
ImClone, another company that figures prominently in the book, has encountered problems in trying to have its new anti-cancer drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration. 
And her praise of Corning, a leader in fiber optics, and IdeaLab, the technology venture capital firm, overlook some harsh realities: Corning lost $5.5 billion last year and idled many factories because of the global glut in fiber optic cable, and investors in IdeaLab have sued its founder, Bill Gross, accusing him of squandering their money.
But none of that detracts from the overall message that Ms. White offers. As was the case with Mr. Ditzel, the best innovators find it hard to work in an organization that is too wedded to the status quo. In traditional organizations, "people who have investments in the 'old model' are not always happy to see new talent coming along with a bright and shiny new design," Ms. White writes.
"Typically, the need to change is in conflict with the need to stay the same," she adds.
SHE says the best way for top executives to encourage innovation is to spot the talent in the company, then give these people enormous room to run and expose them to other influences, whether art or different scientific disciplines. 
The point is to create what she called a "spark soup" of data and thought-sharing from which new ideas emerge. "New things don't tend to come out of heavy organization," she writes.
Some executives, like Corning's former chairman, Roger G. Ackerman, even allow ideas they don't like to percolate. They also encourage innovators to play around with their mistakes. The company, she argues, has a "new-idea culture."
Elsewhere, she writes that true innovators do their best work when they have emotional connections to others in their research unit. Ms. White quotes Mr. Gross, of IdeaLab, as arguing that researchers should be organized as "tribes" doing battle against other tribes. That allows for "greater intimacy, better communications and more camaraderie," the author says.
Reflecting her artistic background, Ms. White writes that too many executives attempt to make decisions strictly by the numbers. The numbers, like returns on investment, often don't capture "mushy stuff" like the quality of a company's employees and the value of brands and customer bases, she says.
One surprise in the book is that Ms. White finds creativity in companies that aren't widely known for innovation: Progressive Insurance, Welch Foods and Capital One Financial, for example. Progressive, now the No. 4 insurer in the country, has turned auto insurance upside down by figuring out ways to offer lower rates in many cases and changing the way accident victims repair their cars. Rather than giving a customer an estimate to take to a repair shop, which encourages both the customer and repair shop to pad the bill, Progressive takes charge of the repairs and has them done at a lower cost.
THE company's chairman, Peter Lewis, told Ms. White that he got some of his best ideas when he swam -- with a tape recorder poised at each end of the pool. "I've solved most of my problems at the end of the workday, in a somewhat altered state of consciousness," Mr. Lewis said.
Aside from the broad lessons on creativity, the book offers compelling personal accounts of how brilliant people create new things. The sensational design that Frank Gehry developed for the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, started when Mr. Lewis of Progressive Insurance hired the architect in 1989 to design and build his dream house. "I started playing with movements, making shapes that are dynamic and have a quality of movement to them," Mr. Gehry said in the book. One thing led to another, and the design morphed into a museum. 
Many creative people play with ideas and concepts that suddenly blossom, Ms. White concludes. Her innovators often pursue projects in unrelated spheres of life, all at the same time. Sometimes they need immersion in the spark soup; at other times, they need isolation to work all night on new inspirations. 
"New Ideas" has an inspirational quality to it, but not in a crass "lose 10 pounds in five days" way. Even if the technology bubble has popped and Enron has crashed, American creativity isn't over. No one can put innovation in a bottle, but we can keep learning about how to do it better. Ms. White's book will encourage readers to do that.

An Art of Realism Amid Recession And Budget Cuts

BYLINE:  By FELICIA R. LEE; E-mail: fee@nytimes.com

 BODY:
MAURINE D. KNIGHTON, executive director of 651 Arts, wants to make one thing clear: her arts organization is no victim. 
 No. Not even as she talks about cuts of $250,000 in a $1.25 million annual budget for a group that bills itself as Brooklyn's premier presenter of African diaspora arts. The cuts do mean that the group's 2002 main-stage season has been postponed until May, and that a $200-a-ticket gala scheduled for yesterday was canceled. 
 Ms. Knighton, 42, is an animated native of Mississippi who has led the organization for more than 4 of its 13 years. She insists that any setbacks stemming from Sept. 11, city budget cuts and the recession actually represent an opportunity. An opportunity for minority arts groups like 651, with its staff of seven and a loyal group of volunteers in Fort Greene, to find new ways to raise money. What is crucial, Ms. Knighton says, is to persuade more black people to buy a ticket for, say, a dance troupe as readily as they would for a church raffle. 
Historically, there are many reasons that has not happened. But the times call for black New Yorkers who have a sense of self-worth and a few extra dollars to help institutions that support black artists. "At a basic level, it is a validation of self," Ms. Knighton said.
She has a few strategies in mind. They include forming partnerships with profit-making arts groups and luring more people to serve on 651 Arts' nine-person board. She hopes to expand the board to 20. Ms. Knighton also wants to aggressively increase individual donations, now a small part of a budget dependent on foundation grants.
At 651 Fulton Street in the Majestic Theater, 651 Arts dwells in the same valley of cutbacks and uncertainties as most of the city's 2,000 arts institutions. They all face the gravest economic period since the fiscal crisis in the 1970's. But when big institutions catch cold, those run by minority groups get pneumonia.
"Groups of color have fewer resources and less access to money available through philanthropy," said Norma P. Munn, chairwoman of the New York City Arts Coalition, an arts advocacy group. "They get a smaller amount than that given to comparable white organizations. It's more patronizing than racism."
As artists and patrons, blacks have historically not only been excluded from mainstream institutions, but also, until recently, lacked their own. Many of the most established black cultural institutions are not that old. The Alvin Ailey dance group started in 1958, the Studio Museum of Harlem in the mid-1970's. That is one reason blacks have been more accustomed to giving to churches or schools, rather than to arts organizations, said Claude Johnson, 651 Art's director of institutional planning. 
But 651 represents a second wave in black cultural institutions. For one, its mission is to reach beyond what black Americans are doing in theater, dance, music and the humanities and to represent black talent worldwide. At the same time, it wants to remain linked to its base in Fort Greene, a neighborhood known for attracting a diverse black population and nurturing black artists. 
As a showcase for dance artists like Donald Byrd ("Harlem Nutcracker" and "Jazz Train") and its acclaimed annual "Black Dance: Tradition and Transformation" festival, which brought together black dancers from places like South Africa, Paris and London, 651 had started to hit its stride.
As the predominantly black Fort Greene continues to change, though, with more whites attracted to the neighborhood's elegant brownstones and funky vibe, some wonder whether 651 will be helped or hurt. 
Ms. Knighton says enough newcomers have embraced 651. Some artists and business people also think 651 can capitalize on the new elan and money. Others fear it could go the way of the black artists who put Fort Greene on the map, but were pushed out by rising rents.
"We as artists have to reaffirm how important these institutions are to us," Tracie Morris, a poet who lives in nearby Cobble Hill, said of 651. "Where is the place for the innovative black artist? There has to be a way to address this issue without wringing our hands about it."

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH/John D. Enlund; 
Country Growth Fund

 BODY:
THE economic slowdown, now an official recession, may last longer than most people think, contends John D. Enlund, lead manager of the $175 million Country Growth fund.
 "Our concern is that we have a recessionary environment driven by an overcapacity in production," Mr. Enlund said from his office in Bloomington, Ill. "We're not so sure that the interest rate cuts and fiscal stimulus will be enough to soak up all that extra capacity." 
 His cautious stance has prompted him to raise the fund's cash stake, to 12 percent from a more typical 3 to 5 percent. "We found some opportunities in the post-Sept. 11 market drop," he said, "but not much since then."
The fund returned 4 percent a year, on average, for the three years through Thursday, compared with losses of 3 percent for its group of large blend funds and 3.3 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, according to Morningstar Inc. It lost 9.6 percent in the last 12 months, versus losses of 14.4 percent for its group and 12.7 percent for the index.
On March 1, the fund will beginassessing a sales charge of 5.5 percent on new Class A shares, as an incentive for its sales force.
Mr. Enlund, 45, works with four other money managers at Country Trust Bank, the fund's adviser. Together, they manage about $8 billion in five funds plus individual and insurance accounts.
To pick the 70 or so stocks in the fund, Mr. Enlund looks for growing sales and earnings over the next three to five years. He shops mostly among United States companies with capitalizations of at least $5 billion.
For 60 to 70 percent of the portfolio, he aims to buy companies in the S.& P. 500 and to roughly replicate the 10 industry sectors of the index. The remainder of the fund can include stocks outside the index, and is used to emphasize or de-emphasize the 10 sectors, depending on Mr. Enlund's economic outlook.
Generally, he keeps sector weightings within 50 percent, in either direction, of their levels in the index.
For now, the weightings essentially mirror those of the index, he said, because he added more technology stocks after Sept. 11, bringing the tech percentage up to the mid-teens.
There is one exception: energy stocks. They account for about 10 percent of the fund's assets, compared with 6 percent of the index. "Recognizing that oil prices are very low right now," he said, "we think that new reserves will have to be developed over the next five years."
Mr. Enlund seeks attractively priced growth stocks. The earnings growth rate for the portfolio companies has averaged 11 percent a year over the last 10 years, in line with the index. But the fund's companies trade for about 20 times projected 2002 earnings, well below Wall Street estimates of 28 times to 40 times this year's earnings for the S.& P.
In selecting companies, he also looks for strong revenue growth from new products or new stores, for example. "I prefer growth from internal sources as opposed to acquisitions," he said, "because I think it's more sustainable."
Last summer, Mr. Enlund began buying shares of the Apache Corporation, an oil and gas company based in Houston. He paid $49.04, on average, adjusted for a stock dividend; they closed on Friday at $51.57. His 12-month target price is $60.
"As oil prices turn around in the next 24 months," he said, "the company will be a major beneficiary of increased prices and its ability to find and exploit reserves."
HE also likes the Target Corporation, the Minneapolis-based retailer that operates Marshall Field's department stores and Mervyn's and Target discount stores. He began buying the stock in late September at $28.63, on average; it now trades at $44.39, compared with his target price of $49. He said the Target discount stores had a slightly more upscale clientele than rivals, Wal-Mart and Kmart. The stores have been introducing supercenters combining general merchandise with groceries. Earnings should continue growing at a percentage pace in the mid-teens, he said.
Last fall, Mr. Enlund started buying shares of Siebel Systems of San Mateo, Calif., which provides sales, marketing and customer service information software to businesses. He expects continuing strong demand for the software, with average annual earnings growth of more than 25 percent over three to five years. 
He paid $13.20 a share, on average; the stock closed on Friday at $28.94. He said the stock would be a candidate for sale as its price approached $40.

HEADLINE: Web Site Helped Change Farm Policy 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 23 

 BODY:
Throughout the angry Senate debate about whether to limit subsidies to wealthy farmers, lawmakers kept referring to "the Web site" to make their points.
 "You can see on the Web site -- 10 percent of the farmers get most of the money," said Senator Don Nickles, Republican of Oklahoma. 
 "I looked up Indiana on the Web site," said Senator Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana, "and very few Indiana farmers would be affected by a modest limit."
No one had to ask, "What Web site?" 
It is www.ewg.org, operated by the Environmental Working Group, a small nonprofit organization with the simple idea that the taxpayers who underwrite $20 billion a year in farm subsidies have the right to know who gets the money.
Conceived by Ken Cook, 50, director of the group, the Web site has become unusual in the crowded world of special-interest politics, where it is hard to get noticed in Washington, much less heard.
It not only caught the attention of lawmakers, it also helped transform the farm bill into a question about equity and whether the country's wealthiest farmers should be paid to grow commodity crops while many smaller family farms receive nothing and are going out of business.
In farm circles, where neighbors now know who is receiving the biggest checks from the government, the Web site has name recognition roughly equal to that of Heinz ketchup.
"Now I understand how my 'farmer' brother-in-law can afford a $400,000 condo at the beach, despite all his poor-mouthing," a Texas woman wrote after searching the Web site.
To the uninitiated, the small, specialized niche on the World Wide Web looks like an overnight success. Since going public in November, it has recorded 20 million searches.
But Mr. Cook said the site was the culmination of his life of thinking about farms and the environment.
His grandfather Samuel Cook founded the family ranch outside Roselle, Mo., in the foothills of the Ozark Mountains. His uncle inherited the farm. Ken Cook grew up in a St. Louis suburb after his father died when he was 5 years old. But the large Cook family, headed by his uncle Paul, took him in every summer and most holidays, teaching him to cut and bale hay and tend to the calves on the family's 1,000-acre spread. He is anything but romantic about life at the Cook ranch.
"From a car window all those family farms look picturesque, but when you're living it, it can be endless chores," he said. "The barnyard. The pastures. I loved it."
Mr. Cook studied agriculture and history at the University of Missouri, and later received a master's degree in soil science.
His early goal, he said, was to put his education to work protecting the environment and places like the Cook farm.
But most of the decisions about farming and the environment were being made in Washington, so he moved here in 1977 and spent the next 15 years trying to find a suitable job.
"It wasn't an easy time," Mr. Cook said. "There was almost no room for conservation programs on the farm while farmers were planting fence post to fence post."
As an agriculture analyst at the Congressional Research Service, Mr. Cook learned the value of analyzing government data for lawmakers.
"I got lucky and worked with a great agricultural economist, Barry Carr, who taught me how to think about agriculture policy," he said.
Later, as a freelance writer, he got to know the ways of the Washington press corps.
When he and Richard Wiles founded the Environmental Working Group in 1993, they dedicated themselves to research with political punch. All research projects had to include plans showing how the project could open the political debate and be used by journalists.
They spent their $2 million annual budget on computer database experts, large computer servers and salaries for the 20 people who work at the group's offices in Dupont Circle. The money is raised from nonprofit benefactors like the Joyce Foundation.
The farm subsidy database was the first big project.
It took roughly six years to cultivate: four years of filing requests under the Freedom of Information Act to find out what was available and get the information from the government and two years of the tedious work of compiling the data and putting the information on the Web site.
"We figured that the power of information alone would do more than we could accomplish lobbying or writing elaborate reports," Mr. Cook said. "The data shows what farmers already knew -- the big farms are getting bigger and driving out the smaller farms, thanks to big government subsidies." 
The group's success has brought opponents.
Representative Larry Combest, Republican of Texas and chairman of the Agriculture Committee, accused the group last week of trying to eliminate all support for farmers.
"This is a conservation group that would like to take every dollar in a farm bill and spend it on environmental programs, have no farm programs at all," Mr. Combest said on a radio interview with KPAN in Hereford, Tex.
For Mr. Cook, statements like that, and others that accuse him of being a city slicker without a soul, are vindication that he was right to follow his first impulse and stick to what he knew.
"In my mind, when I talk about water pollution from farm runoff I see the charts and the data, but I also see the pollution in the family creek on our farm," he said. "That was from mining. We work on mining, too."

HEADLINE: Florida Hopes Spring Brings a Rebound 

BYLINE:  By DANA CANEDY

DATELINE: KISSIMMEE, Fla., Feb. 22 

 BODY:
Free tattoos in Panama City Beach, discount Disney tickets in Orlando and breakfast in bed in Kissimmee. Those are some of the perks up for grabs simply for partying in parts of Florida this spring.
 Hit hard by the steep drop in visitors after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, hotel operators in Florida vacation cities are aggressively competing for the spring break crowd -- those noisy throngs of young people with shorts, tank tops and open beer containers that some places once tried just as hard to drive away. 
 "Our rates are low and we've had to cut some deals," said Gary Lobo, general manager of the Clarion Hotel Maingate here. Along with the $49.95 a night rate, he is offering his guests free breakfast during spring break and promoting a free shuttle service to the theme parks. 
"We've had to be very aggressive," Mr. Lobo said. "A full hotel at a lower rate is better than an empty hotel with a full rate." 
Sulma Crosby, who cleans rooms at the Clarion knows that a full hotel during spring break, from mid-March until early May, means catering to rambunctious teenagers, more wet towels from the pool and more beds to make. But after having had her work week cut from five days to two, Ms. Crosby is looking forward to making as many beds as she can manage. "I'm sure we're going to do better with spring break," she said. "Everybody was hurting bad. At this point we really need them." 
In Daytona Beach, events organizers are counting on brisk spring break business, too, hoping to help it along by spending a bit more this year on spot advertisements on MTV, ESPN and other frat-friendly channels in 35 markets. Organizers have also mailed about 50,000 promotional posters to fraternities and sororities on college campuses. 
Daytona Beach's spring break planners also say that the lingering fear of flying among travelers since Sept. 11 may give the town a competitive advantage. 
"We're typically a drive destination," said Scott Edwards, chairman of the Daytona Beach Spring Break Marketing Committee. "I think we're getting some people who would have traveled to Mexico or elsewhere just because they can just drive here instead of fly."
The Flamingo Inn in Daytona Beach is counting on the college crowd driving from across the country. "Nothing is going to stop them from getting to spring break," said Merle Kappelman, owner of the hotel, which closes its doors to the public and rents rooms exclusively to college students from March 9 to April 15. 
One city, though, has decided not to court spring break business. Officials in Fort Lauderdale, which took years to shed its image as the nation's spring break capital, say the city cannot afford to woo too many students, even if times are hard.
"South Florida in general is in much better shape than when college kids were in town," said Nicki Grossman, president of the Greater Fort Lauderdale Convention and Visitors Bureau, who recalls the 1980's when the city's one mile stretch of beach was overrun by 370,000 loud, rowdy, drunken college students. 
"They want inflatable 30-foot beer cans on the beach, they want MTV, drinking contests, and they're not going to find that here," Ms. Grossman said. "It is an image we're recovering from." 
Instead, Fort Lauderdale, which boasts of drawing only 15,000 spring breakers last year, is betting on family-oriented tourists and business conventioneers returning over the next year if the economy continues to pick up and there are no new terrorist attacks. Students are simply not good business, Ms. Grossman said. "The price a college student is willing to pay for a hotel room doesn't make it worth it for us." 
Other cities are looking to snag visitors for spring break any way they can. 
"When the events unfolded in September, we felt we needed to concentrate on this more," said Jayna Leach, a spokeswoman for the Panama City Beach Convention and Visitors bureau. So the city signed up more corporate sponsors this year to offer such enticements as free tattoos and passes for open bars at nightclubs. Events planners are spending more money on advertising, including a 12-page insert in college newspapers promoting the area.
Not to be outdone, the Orlando visitors bureau lined up more than 50 area hotels to reduce rates, offer free nights with extended stays and provide free breakfast and other perks. It also teamed up with Disney and other area theme parks to promote discount and second-day-free tickets to some attractions.
"Obviously we're competing with other sun destinations," said Jos Estorino, senior vice president of marketing for the Orlando/Orange County Convention and Visitors Bureau. "It's a recovery plan."

HEADLINE: PRO BASKETBALL: INSIDE THE N.B.A.; 
The New Rules of the Game in Building, and Rebuilding, a Winner

BYLINE:  By MIKE WISE 

 BODY:
In less complicated times, this is how you made your team better at the N.B.A. trading deadline: a free-agent-to-be All-Star was acquired for a couple of nice role players and a draft pick or two, or you got rid of an overpaid albatross for someone else's overpaid albatross, hoping he would fit in better.
 Every now and then, a young, emerging player would land in a general manager's lap, if for no other reason than his current team was afraid it could not sign him to a long-term deal after his contract was up. 
 But no one trades those kinds of players anymore; the teams they signed with as rookies now re-sign them. Fewer and fewer franchises exchange high-priced lemons because of luxury-tax and other economic fears. 
"Building and bettering your team is much different than it once was," Chris Wallace, the Boston general manager, said in an interview last month. "For a while, the draft became less important than stockpiling your salary-cap money and grabbing the big talent. Now, most of the top guys don't make it to free agency." 
Four of the best players to emerge from the 1997 draft -- Vince Carter, Paul Pierce, Dirk Nowitzki and Antawn Jamison -- all signed maximum extensions with their respective teams in the last year. The collective bargaining agreement signed by players and owners in 1999 gave teams much more leverage in re-signing their stars.
"A guy really has to hate his situation for you to get a star," Wallace said. "It's not like 1996 when you had Alonzo Mourning, Juwan Howard and Shaquille O'Neal. Guys like that just don't hit free agency anymore. You're looking at an era where it's imperative to draft well and improve your team incrementally sometimes, rather than going crazy all at once."
The Celtics were one of only eight National Basketball Association teams to make a deal before last Thursday's trading deadline, acquiring the veterans Rodney Rogers and Tony Delk in a five-player deal with Phoenix on Wednesday. Boston sent the rookie Joe Johnson and the veterans Randy Brown and Milt Palacio -- along with its coming first-round draft pick -- to the Suns. 
In interviews recently with nine of the league's general managers, a consensus of the job began to emerge. Not only are executives dealing with high school juniors contemplating leaving without their diploma, but economic realties have forced many teams to rethink their strategy. 
"First of all, there are no geniuses in this business," said Jerry Krause, who before Chicago's recent three-year slide was twice named executive of the year. "Anybody who has a set formula, I'd love to see it. A G.M.'s job is complicated.
"Fifteen or 20 years ago, I went and watched the best college seniors in the country," Krause added. "You'd see a sophomore or junior who could play and you'd write his name down, figuring you'd see him in two years. Last year, I saw more high school games than I ever dreamed of. You throw in the European scouting, more complications in the salary cap, and the job just gets bigger and bigger."
Krause and the Bulls last week traded for Jalen Rose, Indiana's leading scorer and most versatile player, and point guard Travis Best. Chicago parted with Ron Mercer, Ron Artest and Brad Miller and the backup point guard Kevin Ollie. Chicago also received Norm Richardson and a conditional second-round pick. 
Rose represented Krause's first major acquisition after several failed attempts to make room under the salary cap and to acquire big-name free agents like Tracy McGrady and Eddie Jones, who ended up with teams in their home state of Florida. "We really wanted Tracy and Eddie," Krause said. "We thought they would have changed us dramatically. But I couldn't control where they were born."
Krause and other executives say there are four elements in building a team: the draft, free agency, trades and working with current players to better the team from within. "But with cap situations, trade kickers and sometimes the goals of management differing from the goals of ownership," Krause said, "it's tough for some teams."
Donnie Walsh, the Pacers' team president, recently said one of the major frustrations was finding a top-flight center to contend with the Lakers' Shaquille O'Neal. 
"Everyone is looking for a matchup for Shaq," Walsh said. "In the finals two years ago, I looked down low and couldn't see Dale Davis behind Shaq. When you can't see your center, it's time to rebuild."
"In two years, there'll be a lot of big guys out there," Walsh said, referring to 2003 free agents like Tim Duncan, Jermaine O'Neal, Michael Olowokandi and Antonio McDyess. "But there are no savior, young big men out there right now. That guy is probably in Tibet. We'll hear about him in two years."
The Celtics' Wallace said there is no sure-fire plan, but he added that patience helps. "Fans and media are always calling for change," he said. "I mean, the Nets' trading for Jason Kidd may be extraordinary for the Nets. But how many teams come out overwhelming winners in deals? Some of the best deals you do are the ones you don't do.
"It's really easy to get blinded on the short term and end up in that maze. I equate N.B.A. basketball with being in a maze. You don't want to get further in the maze."

Hockey Instead of Hoops
Andrei Kirilenko got to watch one of the heroes from his homeland Friday night. Kirilenko, a 20-year-old Utah Jazz rookie, took in the United States-Russia Olympic semifinal, cheering wildly for the Russian goalie, Nikolai Khabibulin, in the Americans' 3-2 victory. 
Kirilenko was in Salt Lake City because he had some down time with his Jazz teammates before they went back on the road again. Not that that is a bad thing.
Forced out of the Delta Center, the figure skating site at the Winter Games, the Jazz (31-24) has used its unheard-of nine-game road trip to re-establish its credibility as a bona fide playoff team.
Utah has won six straight on the road, playing that archaic pick-and-roll style that has characterized its success for parts of three decades. Coach Jerry Sloan is cursing less and praising more, Karl Malone and John Stockton are putting up numbers again, and the emergence of Kirilenko, along with Scott Padgett, has given the Jazz a bit of youthful pizazz. 
Kirilenko had 21 points and 6 blocked shots in a rout of Denver last Wednesday, the final game of an extended 10-day trip. Padgett made 9 of 12 shots in only 27 minutes. It was Utah's ninth victory in 11 games. The Jazz also beat Indiana, Philadelphia, Toronto, the Knicks and Cleveland on the road. 
"We caught some teams at the right time," Sloan told The Salt Lake Tribune. "And we caught some teams that were struggling. But we were struggling, too. So it's been nice to see our guys play with a little more energy and to start playing more as a group. When those things happen, you've got a chance to win."

Knicks Draw Little Interest
They shopped Charlie Ward again, to no avail. The names of Shandon Anderson and Othella Harrington almost came up, too. Marcus Camby was even on the block, receiving little interest from teams seeking big men.
What the Knicks found out at the trading deadline: either Latrell Sprewell or Allan Houston will most likely have to go this summer in order to land the prized big man they truly covet.
More than ever, no one is very interested in New York's players. The Knicks wanted Raef LaFrentz, but they could not acquire him with what they were offering. There was talk of Juwan Howard, too, but that died quickly. 
In the end, they may have been used as pawns in the Dallas-Denver deal. Free agents have always used the Knicks for leverage, knowing that New York will force other teams to pay top dollar.
But when the Knicks cannot even pull off a minor deal to better themselves in February, well, it might be wise for season-ticket holders to make vacation plans for late April.

HEADLINE: Governors Want Congress to Ease Welfare Work Rule 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 23 

 BODY:
The nation's governors, who helped write the landmark 1996 welfare law and its stringent work requirements, are now urging Congress to let states relax those requirements for some people on welfare.
 Leaders of the National Governors Association said the group would adopt a new policy on welfare at its winter meeting, which began here today. 
 The governors, an influential voice on national welfare policy, plan to reaffirm the importance of work as a condition of receiving cash assistance. But in view of the sluggish economy and rising unemployment, they say, the work requirements for some families appear unrealistic, and some welfare recipients need more education and training to secure jobs.
Governors also intend to oppose President Bush's effort to cut federal highway spending by 27 percent, or $8.5 billion. Such a cut, they say, would eliminate tens of thousands of jobs and disrupt work on hundreds of road projects. 
Gov. Bill Owens of Colorado, vice chairman of the Republican Governors Association, said the president's highway proposal should not and probably would not become law.
"The president has a role as commander in chief that none of us have to share," Mr. Owens said in an interview. "He needs to make defense and homeland security a priority. Most governors try to make transportation a priority."
In addition, the governors, seeking ways to rein in the explosive growth of Medicaid, said they would pressure drug companies to contain pharmaceutical costs.
Federal law "may be contributing to the rising cost of prescription drugs" by impeding access to lower-cost generic drugs, the governors said in a resolution likely to be adopted at their meeting here.
In the draft policy statement on welfare, the governors said, "The focus on work should remain paramount." But, they said, states should be able to expand the definition of "work activity" to include more job training, education and drug abuse treatment.
Under the 1996 law, at least 50 percent of all families on welfare and 90 percent of two-parent families are supposed to be engaged in work. The governors say Congress should eliminate the higher requirement for two-parent families, which, they say, may unintentionally discourage the formation of such families.
Bush administration officials say they will emphasize work when they make recommendations on welfare policy in the next few days. Many state officials want more flexibility. Governor Owens of Colorado said these goals could be reconciled by allowing welfare recipients to pursue "work-oriented" education and training.
"If you allow education to mean pondering the majesty of the Pyramids, that would not fit the definition," Mr. Owens said. "But if education is closely related to work, I'm in favor of that."
In addition, the governors say Congress should let them relax the time limits on receipt of cash assistance. Under the 1996 law, families generally are not permitted to receive federal welfare benefits for more than five years. Many families are now approaching that limit.
The governors' policy statement says that "at state option and under certain limited circumstances, individuals who are working in unsubsidized employment consistent with the purposes of the law should have the ability to earn additional months of eligibility," beyond the five-year limit.
At a news conference opening today's session, Gov. John Engler of Michigan, a Republican who is chairman of the National Governors Association, cautioned federal officials against trying to impose more mandates and requirements.
"The objective here is not to substitute conservative micromanagement for liberal micromanagement," Mr. Engler said. "The problem is micromanagement."
Governors take credit for making the 1996 law a success. The number of welfare recipients has plummeted, to 5.3 million last September from 12.2 million in 1996. The proportion of children in poverty declined to 16.2 percent in 2000, the lowest level in more than two decades, from 20.5 percent in 1996, according to the Census Bureau.
But governors say they now fear that Republicans and moderate Democrats will try to outdo each other in imposing stricter work requirements, which could prove impossible for states to meet.
Two centrist Democrats -- Senators Evan Bayh of Indiana and Thomas R. Carper of Delaware, both former governors -- said they would soon introduce a bill increasing the work requirement, so that 60 percent of families on welfare would have to be working by 2007.
"The traditional approach of our party has been not to emphasize work requirements," Mr. Bayh said in an interview. "But those requirements have been important in moving people from dependence to self-sufficiency."
Mr. Carper said he knew there would "be some apprehension among some governors about raising the work requirements." 
Mr. Bayh said: "We want to be reasonable. If unemployment rises significantly in a particular state, the new requirements would not be phased in as rapidly there."
Some conservatives in and out of Congress want to set aside federal money for programs that promote marriage and encourage fathers to be more involved in the lives of children on welfare. The new policy statement says "governors oppose any effort to establish set-asides or further restrictions" on the use of federal welfare money.
Under the 1996 law, each state receives a lump sum of federal money, with broad discretion to use it for the benefit of needy families. Any requirement that states spend a certain amount for a specific purpose "would violate the basic tenets" of the law, the governors contend.
Federal grants to the states for public assistance total $16.5 billion a year. Some Republicans have said Congress can reduce this amount because the welfare rolls have shrunk. But governors say Congress should increase federal welfare spending to keep pace with inflation in coming years.
The governors' statement is silent on whether states should be required to increase state spending on welfare to keep up with inflation. In the absence of such a requirement, members of Congress say, they are unlikely to increase federal grants.
"You can't ask the federal government to increase its share without asking more from the states," a Congressional aide said.
The governors also called on Congress to give states the option of restoring welfare benefits to legal immigrants who have not become citizens.
With President Bush focused mainly on war and national security, and with Congress at a partisan impasse on many issues, governors have taken the lead in shaping domestic policy.
Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont, a Democrat, is leading efforts to put the governors on record in support of federal legislation that would increase access to generic drugs, as an alternative to brand-name medicines.
"Pharmaceutical companies are exploiting loopholes in a 1984 law to extend their patents unfairly, and this is costing states millions and millions of dollars," Governor Dean said.
The Federal Trade Commission and many states have accused drug companies of engaging in anticompetitive behavior to delay entry of generic drugs into the American market.
Brand-name drug companies deny there is any problem. They are lobbying the governors' association to reject Mr. Dean's proposal.
The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a lobby for brand-name drug companies, says that 45 percent of prescriptions are already filled with generic drugs, up from 18 percent in 1984. Generic drug makers will have new marketing opportunities in the next few years, as patents for many popular drugs expire, the group said.

HEADLINE: Enriched by Working Class, Wal-Mart Eyes BMW Crowd 

BYLINE:  By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

DATELINE: MONROE, N.Y. 

 BODY:
Wal-Mart Stores just became the nation's biggest company, the first retailer to have done so. It got there by sounding a single note -- low prices -- that attracted millions of mostly working-class Americans in search of everything from toilet paper to fishing rods. 
 Now, after leveling discount chains from Kmart to Caldor, Ames to Bradlee's, Wal-Mart executives are setting their sights on a fresh target: more affluent shoppers who pride themselves on snagging bargains and who discovered stores like Target, Costco and Kohl's some time ago. 
 Many of the 178 stores Wal-Mart has opened in the last year are in well-off suburbs like Plano, Tex., and Alpharetta, Ga. All include grocery sections the size of a supermarket, with gourmet desserts and fresh herbs to attract people with money to spend. Wal-Marts new and old are also adding pricier products, from big-screen televisions to digital cameras to more glamorous cookware. 
But reaching for new customers holds risks for Wal-Mart. It has succeeded by selling to penny-wise shoppers, and could alienate them, experts say, if it replaces too many private-label slacks and run-of-the-mill sheets with European cookware and personal computers.
"As they add these new customers, as they trade up, the risk is that a new Sam Walton in some place that you and I have never heard of says, 'Hey, I'm going to buy it low, stack it high and sell it cheap,' " said Richard S. Tedlow, a professor of business administration at the Harvard Business School and the author of "Giants of Enterprise," a study of Wal-Mart and other companies. Another risk is that "traditional customers are going to look at Godiva ice cream and they're not going to want it and they're not going to feel at home."
Founded in Arkansas 40 years ago by a five-and-dime merchant, Sam Walton, Wal-Mart built its empire with stores in rural areas where land was cheap and shoppers looking for variety and low prices saw few alternatives. By the time Mr. Walton died 10 years ago, Wal-Mart was the largest discounter. Just last month the company passed Exxon Mobil to become the nation's largest company in sales, reporting $217.8 billion for the fiscal year ended Jan. 31. Wal-Mart is also the nation's largest private employer, with more than 1.2 million employees.
There are 2,600 Wal-Marts, with heavy concentrations in Texas, Florida, Illinois, California and Missouri. It has moved into the Northeast more recently -- there are a handful of stores in the New York metropolitan area, and 116 scattered across the region's three states -- but for the most part it avoids large cities. 
The newest Wal-Marts speak to the company's quiet but growing emphasis on reaching beyond its longtime customers.
At the store here in Monroe, about an hour's drive north from New York, which opened a year ago, Jeep Grand Cherokees and Lexuses are lined up next to Saturns and Ford Broncos. In the grocery section, where the shelves bristle with "We Accept Food Stamps" signs, the Kraft marshmallow spread now shares space with Nutella, an imported chocolate-hazelnut puree.
In the TV section, it's not just the $100 19-inch Orion color sets that Wal-Mart wants to sell. There are also 61-inch models made by RCA for $1,699. And lately there are digital cameras, too, like the Sony P30.
The new customers have a distinctly different mission. "Everything you need for a summer house, you can certainly get in Wal-Mart," said Kathy Sullivan, a Suffern, N.Y., resident who said she discovered the chain after buying a vacation home in Cooperstown. She shops mainly for food and paper products, she said, and has been pleasantly surprised by the selection and the prices. "Normally I shop at A.& P., which is very expensive, relatively." 
Pursuing someone like Ms. Sullivan alters the cost of doing business. Stores opening in suburbs typically must pay more for their real estate. And adding big-ticket items to the lineup can be hazardous. "When you go beyond the basic necessities of life, there is more volatility," said John R. McMillin, an analyst for Prudential Securities. "There will be times when the diamond rings don't turn as well as the milk." 
But analysts say Wal-Mart has no choice. "They've had to go into more suburban, upscale places," said Carl Steidtmann, the chief economist for Deloitte & Touche. "They've run out of other places to build stores."
Not just Wal-Mart but other discounters have benefited from the slowing economy. Their sales have shot up while business for department stores and luxury-goods retailers has fallen. Just how Wal-Mart's push for higher-income customers will affect these other chains is not clear. Spokesmen for Kohl's and Target would not comment on Wal-Mart's strategy, and the president of Costco, Jim Sinegal, to whom other executives referred requests for comment, was traveling last week and could not be reached.
But because Wal-Mart is so large and powerful, its move is bound to increase competition, affecting prices in an already low-margin business. Its entry into the supermarket business, where it quickly became No. 1, accelerated the sale of small stores to larger ones, said David Orgel, editor in chief of Supermarket News, and inspired industry seminars around one topic: how to compete against Wal-Mart.
Despite its formidable size, attracting and keeping more affluent shoppers is a battle that Wal-Mart must wage with great care. While it has always promoted "good, better and best" variety, never has it zeroed in on the wealthier customer with such resolve.
"Wal-Mart knows they have a consumer with high income who takes pride in being a smart shopper, and they want to give them more to buy," said Candace Corlett, a partner with WSL Strategic Retail, a consulting firm in Manhattan. "The next key to sales growth for Wal-Mart is to increase the size of the average transaction."
At the same time, Wal-Mart has to maintain its base -- the hard-working people who regularly shop the stores for all kinds of necessities. "We've always been identified with the most dominant shopper we have, the people who work paycheck to paycheck, week to week," said Tom Coughlin, the president of the Wal-Mart Stores division. While the stores have no intention of ignoring that shopper, "we've got the ability to customize according to the customer," he said.
Some say this is an extension of Wal-Mart's longtime strategy. "I think they've found a sweet spot, which is great products at great prices," said Robert A. Eckert, the chairman and chief executive of Mattel, which sells millions of Fisher-Price, Barbie and Hot Wheels toys through Wal-Mart. "People are now drawing that conclusion, that they don't have to sacrifice great products for great prices."
In the Dallas suburb of Plano, for instance, Wal-Mart found that its usual jewelry offerings -- in 10-karat gold -- just weren't good enough. "Our store sits in the middle of $700,000 to $1 million homes," Mr. Coughlin said, "and if you're not selling 14-karat in Plano, you're not meeting the customer's expectations."
In the last year, a new women's clothing line called George has gone on display in many stores. "It's their answer to Mossimo at Target," said one women's-wear manufacturer, who has done business with Wal-Mart for years and asked not to be identified. "It's not as young and not as chic, but it's a step up from where they've been."
One longtime Wal-Mart shopper said she was pleased to see a better selection. "The duration of their pots and pans, the generics they sold, was very short," said Victoria Morris, who said she had moved to Monroe recently from Mississippi. "So they are upgrading. There is a wider choice of more high-end quality products. I see it in the linens, the electronics, and the cookware and the bakeware."
In the cookware aisle, there are still low-priced aluminum skillets and covered pots for sale. But alongside them are Revere pans, a venerable American brand, as well as T-Fal, a French line.
Wal-Mart has forged agreements intended to bring upscale items into its stores. Among them is a strategic partnership with Olympus, the camera maker, said Burt Flickinger III, a managing partner with Reach Marketing in Westport, Conn. "Historically, you'd only find Olympus in the specialty camera shops," he said. "Wal-Mart has matched Target's lead in going to high-end cameras. They will now go up to the $700 range. They are way beyond the typical Wal-Mart of a few years ago." 
With 70 million of the 110 million weekly Wal-Mart customers earning $25,000 to $50,000 a year, the store is still largely supported by the people that Sam Walton dedicated himself to serving. 
Some of Wal-Mart's efforts to stock its shelves with upscale goods have irritated manufacturers. The company paid $6.4 million in 1999 to settle a lawsuit from Tommy Hilfiger over counterfeit clothing sold in some of its stores, and an additional $1.4 million to settle a similar claim from the makers of Polo, Fubu and Nautica last year. In October, Fubu sued Wal-Mart again, contending that a line of store-brand clothes with an "05" printed on them violated a Fubu trademark for an identical logo. That case is pending. 
In its supermarkets, Wal-Mart has found it fairly simple to improve its selection, selling Godiva chocolate raspberry truffle ice cream in its store in East Stroudsburg, Pa., along with the Sam's Choice store brand. And in many cases, its prices do undercut competing supermarkets, enticing shoppers. 
"I probably travel 15 minutes to shop here," said Dara Hackett, a shopper in the Monroe store, "and I have a Super Stop and Shop a quarter-mile from me."
The trick for Wal-Mart will be to transfer the success it has had in broadening its grocery array to apparel, housewares and other categories inside its mammoth stores.
Mr. Coughlin pledged allegiance to the low-budget Wal-Mart customer. At the same time, he said: "Will we try to find things to do to improve our relationship with customers who have more income? Absolutely."
Mr. McMillin, the analyst, put it another way. "Whether you're rich or whether you're poor," he said, "everybody wants a bargain."

HEADLINE: In Drought, Fears of a Dry Future; 
Planners Worry About Water Supply in the Long Term

BYLINE:  By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

 BODY:
With soil parched, reservoirs depleted and streams trickling at rates typical of a record summer heat wave, water managers for New York City and surrounding communities are scurrying to find new ways to increase supplies and cut demand.
 It is not that they are worried about getting through the East Coast's current dry spell, which technically began in 1998 and -- like all droughts -- will end eventually. In fact, many water officials and experts say the tough droughts in the 1960's and 1980's prompted conservation measures that have cut profligate water use. 
 The new effort is aimed at a point down the line -- no one knows how far in the future -- when spreading development reduces the soil's storage capacity, and the growing population and economy boost demand so much that some places run dry.
For some communities, chronic water shortages could lead to a politician's ultimate nightmare -- an immovable cap on economic growth. 
"It's going to be a tough, dry season," said Bradley M. Campbell, the acting commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. But more important than getting through this year, he said, is changing practices so the metropolitan region can handle future, potentially larger, climate shifts comfortably. "We need to change the way we do business in managing water resources," he said.
Government hydrologists say a prolonged lack of precipitation and warm temperatures this winter are setting the metropolitan region up for a summer drought that could rival what is called the "drought of record," which drained reservoirs and wells from 1963 to 1965. New York City and most New Jersey counties have been under a drought warning since late January. 
The Delaware River Basin Commission, which controls Delaware River water used by 20 million people, issued a drought emergency in December that reduces allotments for New York City and the four states sharing the supply.
In New Jersey, some private water suppliers have begun offering steep discounts to large users when water is plentiful, to encourage those that have storage capacity to fill up when water is abundant and cut water use.
But much more must be done, said Mr. Campbell, whose agency is trying to get developers to change their approach to some projects -- to create parking lots with permeable material instead of asphalt, for example, allowing rain to percolate into the soil.
The state also needs to clean up its galaxy of toxic waste sites, which continue to taint groundwater and keep that resource off limits for drinking, he said.
Eventually, fundamental shifts in development patterns will probably be necessary, water policy experts in the region say. 
"What comes first, the water supply or the housing?" said Gary N. Paulachok, the deputy Delaware River master, who is charged with making sure the users of of the river's water are honoring binding agreements to share it.
"In a lot of cases," he said, "we see housing developments go in and then the search is on for a water supply." 
To stave off trouble, New York City is taking a fresh look at a range of ideas even as its engineers inspect equipment it last used in the drought emergency of 1989 to pump and treat water from the Hudson River 60 miles north of the city -- the source of last resort.
It is considering buying small private water supplies south of its Delaware River reservoirs in the Catskills, which could help it meet its obligations under an interstate water compact. The city has to keep some water flowing in dry times to other users of the Delaware River in New Jersey and elsewhere downstream.
By gaining control of other water sources feeding into the Delaware, the city could satisfy its water-sharing requirement without taking as much from reservoirs holding the city's supply.
City officials have also started asking big commercial users of water to consider switching, where possible, to recycled wastewater for nondrinking purposes instead of using high-quality drinking water.
"Ninety percent of the water we use does not go to human needs," said Charles G. Sturcken, chief of staff of New York City's Department of Environmental Protection. The city is interested in pursuing anything that cuts the use of drinking water for other purposes, he said.
The goal, city officials said, would be to install systems for reusing water for such purposes, the way car washes and laundries capture, filter and reuse water that would otherwise go down the drain. One large consumer cited by Mr. Sturcken is the airports. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey guzzles tens of thousand of gallons of water a day to wash planes at the regional airports it operates. 
To keep jobs and businesses coming to Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx and Staten Island without straining drinking water supplies, Mr. Sturcken said, the city is considering drawing undrinkable groundwater from wells in Brooklyn and Queens to supply, at a discount rate, to businesses needing water for manufacturing.
And in a layer of porous rock deep beneath the boroughs, the city is also considering creating a reservoir, a giant underground bubble of water stored in the porous earth. In times of surplus, water would be pumped into this layer of porous rock, then pumped out when supplies are low, city officials said.
New Jersey already has nine such reservoirs, called aquifer storage and recovery systems, and five more are planned or are being built, said R. David G. Pyne, a water engineer in Gainesville, Fla., who keeps track of water storage projects around the world and maintains a Web site on the technology, www.asrforum.com.
Subterranean banking of water is most established in dry regions. Las Vegas has the largest aquifer storage system in the United States, pumping up to 100 million gallons a day into the ground. New York City's would equal that, if tests bear out its merits, Mr. Sturcken said.
Another result of the region's steadily lengthening drought, which water experts say almost guarantees strict limits on use this summer in the New York metropolitan area, is intensifying tugs of war over shared supplies. 
Most notable is the growing grumbling over how best to share the Delaware River, which provides about half of New York City's water through aqueducts leading from the Catskills and also serves 12 million people downstream, some as far as Philadelphia and parts of Delaware. 
City environmental officials say they have been pressing the Delaware River Basin Commission to fulfill commitments to build new reservoirs downstream. Under the existing sharing scheme among New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware, established after two battles before the United States Supreme Court, the city is obliged to dump water from its reservoirs to sustain a certain flow in the Delaware. 
Robert Tudor, the deputy executive director of the river basin commission, said that every option for averting shortages was being considered by communities sharing the water. In Pennsylvania, experts are assessing using old gravel pits and mines to bank excess water, he said. 
The Pennsylvania Legislature is also considering a bill that would create the first statewide system for conserving water and tracking all water use. The bill cites projections that parts of the state will run out of water in a few decades.
Some private water experts say New York City would benefit greatly from adjusting prices for water to encourage conservation in dry times -- the same way transportation officials are now increasing tolls during periods of peak traffic to encourage people to shift driving patterns. 
James T. B. Tripp, a member of the New York City Water Board and general counsel for Environmental Defense, a private conservation group, said that raising rates a certain amount for each level of a drought warning or emergency would encourage landlords, homeowners and businesses to conserve. 
"People respond to prices," he said. "It's a great way to deliver a message."
Even as water disputes intensify and conservation projects move ahead, no one is certain whether the future will be drier or wetter. 
Ever since the city, in the 1830's, put 4,000 laborers to work building distant dams and aquifers for its upstate supply, most decisions and investments made by the people who manage the water system and others nearby have been aimed at preventing problems a generation or more ahead. 
But now there are many indications that the climatic future will not resemble the past, that a global warming trend and other regional shifts measured in recent years hint of bigger, unpredictable, changes to come. 
Most climate experts expect global warming to have big impacts on water supplies around the world, altering storm and drought patterns, spawning more sudden downpours, and shrinking mountain snowpacks that provide long-term water storage for places like California and Afghanistan.
But when the focus closes in on specific regions, the computer models render only a blurry vision. A recent study of the impact of climate change on water supplies in and around New York City by scientists at Columbia University said there would doubtless be changes.
For example, the study said, warmer temperatures will result in more water loss through evaporation and will likely require the city to release more water into upstate streams in the summer to sustain native trout populations. 
But in a warmer world, would there generally be more or less water in the reservoirs? The scientists answered with a blunt maybe. "Current global climate change models cannot forecast rainfall patterns with sufficient accuracy to indicate what will happen to precipitation in the New York City system watersheds," the report said. 
And that leaves the water managers for the city, New Jersey and communities small and large along the East Coast expressing growing concern as they log onto the Internet every day to check government maps of stream and river currents, where colored dots denote the strength of flows. 
For months, the region -- in fact the entire East Coast -- has been peppered with red dots, each indicating a new record low.
The managers know chances are that spring rains will return, or a hurricane will sweep up the coast, or El Nino's slow awakening in the Pacific this year will nudge the jet stream and shake off the dry pattern.
But even so, they say, the array of glowing red dots adds to the urgency of their search for ways to store, conserve or secure more water, because there is the chance that nature will not cooperate.
"Is it good water management policy to depend on tropical storms to get us out of trouble?" said Mr. Paulachok, the Delaware River water official. Last year, such a storm never came, setting up the situation that is intensifying now.
In the meantime, all around the region, the ground is growing drier and streams are continuing to shrivel, according to federal officials.
"In southeastern Pennsylvania, well drillers are working 24-7 to either drill new wells or deepen existing ones," Mr. Paulachok said. "It could be a very, very difficult summer."

Making Unemployment Work (Sort Of)

BYLINE:  By Leslie Eaton

 BODY:
Being unemployed has brought Todd M. Rosenberg fun, some fame, and a very small fortune. Which is why he is in trouble with the New York State Department of Labor.
 Mr. Rosenberg, 32, is the creator of "Laid Off: A Day in the Life," an animated cartoon (or at least as animated as a cartoon can be when it's about a guy who spends all day watching TV in a blue bathrobe and eating Pringles). It's a hoot. 
 More than a million people have popped onto www.oddtodd.com, Mr. Rosenberg's Web site, to watch the cartoon, play Elf Up, look at photos of kitties or connect to his Yahoo e-mail club, Laid Off Land.
 Then there's the "Daily Fact 1 Learned From the TV," usually with a helpful link. (Recent example: "If you have a problem with ants like coming into your house to hang out you can sprinkle cinnamon or catnip where they're coming in. If you don't believe me you can buy some ants HERE and test it out.")
 Prominently displayed on the site is the cyberspace version of that Starbucks fixture, the tip jar. Click on it and you can e-mail Mr. Rosenberg a dollar (through Pay-Pal or Amazon.com ). He also has a post office box for nonvirtual donations. The suggested contribution: one dollar.
 To his amazement, dollars have come streaming in. Real dollars. Virtual dollars. Nine thousand dollars.
 This sounds like a good thin. And until Valentine's Day, it was.
 After all, Mr. Rosenberg had been unemployed since June, when the dot.com where he worked as director of business development shut down its New York office. "It was a cool job," Mr. Rosenberg said, "except I never really knew how to make money for them." (Neither, apparently, did anyone else.)
 At first, he said, he wasn't worried. He had found work before, the way he did after he quit his job at the Gap because he just couldn't get excited that the green that year was Autumn Mist. And after he quit his job managing a bookstore, became frustrated at a book publisher, and didn't get the raise he wanted at an online bookseller.
 It did dawn on him, he said, that the $405 a week he was getting in unemployment insurance benefits would not cover the rent on his fifth-floor walk-up in the West Village, so he cashed in his 401(k).
 At the time, the job market "Had a bad but temporarily bad feel," Mr. Rosenberg said. But by the end of the summer, none of his job interviews had panned out, and the help-wanted ads were getting skimpy.
 When he realized that he might not find a job for a while, Mr. Rosenberg said, he felt he had to do something productive. He had always loved cartooning, even started a greeting card business (which is where the Odd Todd thin comes from -- and no, he's not particularly odd). So he taught himself Flash animation.
 Which brings us back to the Web site, the tip jar, and the Department of Labor, which called Mr. Rosenberg into its offices on Feb. 14. His benefits had run out in December, and he didn't take the meeting too seriously, he said, until he found himself in "an interrogation room, totally 'NYPD Blue.' "
 While the investigator was very nice, Mr. Rosenberg said he did make it plain that you are not supposed to earn money and collect unemployment at the same time. The Labor department never comments on individual unemployment insurance cases, a spokeswoman said but added that the unemployed are generally allowed to accept donations.
 The other problem, however, is that unemployed people are supposed to be actively looking for work, not spending all of their time answering e-mail, drawing cartoons and getting interviewed on television about being unemployed. So there is a good chance, Mr. Rosenberg said, that he will be asked to repay the last seven weeks of his unemployment benefits -- close to $3,000.
 He doesn't have the money; the tip jar has been paying his rent. "I really am unemployed," he said. "I really am broke."
 He worries about paying the unemployment money back. He worries about how he will make money from his cartoons. He worries that by the time he has figured that out, "my 15 minutes will be over."
 And he worries about what his fans will think when they meet him in person at a "drinkfestathon" at a downtown bar this week. "I hope I don't disappoint them," he said. "I hope they don't expect me to be in the blue robe."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH; 
Three-Decade-Old Echoes, Awakened by Enron

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON

 BODY:
SOMETIMES it's hard to care about Enron.
 The endless investigations. The faux outrage of politicians who not so long ago were gladly on the company's dole. The partnership deals, so complex that even a diligent reader cannot help feeling lost but all adding up to fake profits and hidden losses. 
 Most of all, the refusal of Kenneth L. Lay, Jeffrey K. Skilling and everyone else involved in the whole sorry scandal to take responsibility. It is apparently too much to expect that anyone will say: I was wrong. I apologize. I accept punishment for my actions.
This is American business at its worst, a slick lawyered mess.
Unfortunately, investors have no choice but to pay attention. For better and worse, Enron's impact is rippling over Wall Street and Washington. As the scandal unfolds, here are two big questions worth watching:

How long will Enron linger over stocks, and stock prices?
Many investors want to believe the pall will dissipate quickly. Several strategists have published reports suggesting that concerns about corporate accounting should not stop stocks from rallying.
But history suggests that they are too optimistic. The last time a big, well-known company collapsed as fast as Enron was in 1973, when the Equity Funding Corporation of America, supposedly a fast-growing insurance and mutual fund company, was found to be riddled with fraud and fell apart in weeks.
Like Enron, Equity Funding's collapse threw into high relief the potential conflicts of interest in auditing. "What the Equity Funding scandal tells America's stockholders is that the certification of corporate figures in the annual reports they receive may very well be meaningless," Ray Dirks, an analyst who helped uncover the fraud, wrote later.
And, like Enron, Equity Funding collapsed when stocks were far from cheap and the economy appeared unsteady. So it may be worth recalling that Equity Funding's demise coincided with one of the worst stretches ever for stocks. When the company filed for bankruptcy on April 5, 1973, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was at 108.52. Nine years later, it was 114.73.
Of course, Equity Funding was far from the only reason that stocks stagnated. Inflation and slow growth dogged the economy for much of the 1970's. The United States seemed to be losing its competitiveness. But Equity Funding's collapse discouraged investors from buying stocks for years.

Will regulators finally force companies to report the cost of options as a real expense?
Almost everyone who understands accounting agrees that the way companies account for options is a joke.
They got away with this because they convinced Congress and big investors that it was in everyone's interest to encourage companies to give their employees an ownership stake.
That may be true in theory, especially if the grants are modest. But giant grants, which can enrich top executives enormously for only a year or two of good stock performance, may actually encourage executives to bend accounting rules. Several companies under close scrutiny for their accounting practices, including Computer Associates and Tyco International, have also been criticized as having the most overpaid executives in America. Why worry about the future when the present is so lucrative?

HEADLINE: COVER STORY; 
Tired Enough and Brave Enough to Say No

BYLINE:  By ALLEN BARRA

 BODY:
ON Dec. 1, 1955, without warning, a 42-year-old seamstress from Montgomery, Ala., touched off a firestorm. No revolution was ever begun with more quiet dignity. 
 After a hard day altering and pressing clothes in a department store basement, Rosa Parks and three other black people were ordered to give up their row of seats to a white man. The other three wordlessly complied; Mrs. Parks had had enough. She politely refused, then was arrested and jailed. Shortly after, she would say she was "just too tired" to move, but years later, talking to an interviewer, she gave a much more introspective answer: "When I declined to give up my seat, it was not that day or bus in particular. I just wanted to be free like everybody else." 
 Rosa Parks has had to wait nearly half a century to be given her due as the mother of the civil rights movement. Douglas Brinkley's "Rosa Parks," the first full-length biography of Mrs. Parks for adult readers, was published two years ago. And tonight at 9, CBS will broadcast "The Rosa Parks Story," starring Angela Bassett as Mrs. Parks, Cicely Tyson as her mother, and Peter Francis James as her husband, Raymond Parks. (The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King's son Dexter Scott King makes a cameo appearance as his own father, the little-known Montgomery pastor whom Mrs. Parks's courage thrust into the national limelight.) 
 Shot on location in Montgomery and directed by a black woman, Julie Dash ("Funny Valentines"), "The Rosa Parks Story" appears to be the result of the right elements coming together at the right time. Mr. Brinkley's biography served as the principal historical text for the screenwriter, Paris Qualles (who was nominated for an Emmy for the 2000 Showtime film "A House Divided"). "It probably would have been possible to do this film before Brinkley's biography," said Yvonne Chotzen, an executive producer of the film with her husband, William Jenner, "but God knows it could have taken years to put together." Another element previously unavailable to any film on the civil rights movement was the participation of Rosa Parks herself. 
 "My husband and I had been attracted to her story for a long time," said Ms. Chotzen. "We were curious to see if we could convince her to actually participate in the film. I wrote her the most passionate letter I could, and it reached her at a moment when she was seeking to fund the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute, which reaches out to children all over the world. It was a good time to bring her story to television, and everything else just fell into line." 
 Mrs. Parks served as a consultant for both the personal and historical aspects of the film. Did she find anything in the script to object to? "No," Ms. Dash said, "but I was told she blushed a little at some of the courting scenes between Angela and Peter." 
 Born in Tuskegee, Ala., in 1913, Rosa McCauley Parks was brought up by a schoolteacher mother who adhered to the belief of Booker T. Washington, founder of the Tuskegee Institute, that cleanliness and high moral character were "civilizing agents." Her education, which included four years at the progressive Montgomery Industrial School for Girls, was cut short by her grandmother's illness. She went to work at a textile plant, becoming an accomplished seamstress. Ms. Dash spends nearly the first third of the film recreating this long-vanished world of the Southern black middle class before the onset of the civil rights movement. "I had my doubts about how we would be received in Montgomery," Ms. Dash said, "but in the end everyone couldn't have been more cooperative." 
 "We had scores of people from all over coming up to us offering everything from reminiscences about Raymond and Rosa to what kind of soda pop signs were in the drugstores," Ms. Dash said. "The truly strange part, though, was how ghostly downtown Montgomery felt; much of it is deserted today, for economic reasons. It was almost as if the city had decided to preserve itself as a movie set, waiting for us to come along."
 The Alabama Film Commission was particularly helpful, and Angela Bassett said that Alabama's state senator Charles Steele Jr. "moved heaven and earth to help get this film made."
 Rosa Parks was more than a blue-collar worker who one day decided not to give up her seat on the bus. In 1932 she married Raymond Parks, a barber and a charter member of the Montgomery chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People; they settled in a modest apartment in a two-story brick housing project in a Montgomery ruled by Jim Crow. She was a longtime volunteer worker for the N.A.A.C.P., stamping envelopes, answering phones and typing letters -- a silent warrior for the movement and its leaders, E.D. Nixon, the Rev. Ralph Abernathy and eventually the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Silent, that is, until that evening of December 1955, an evening that "her entire life up to that point had prepared her for," Ms. Bassett said.
 One thing Mrs. Parks was not prepared for, along with the onrush of unwanted national publicity directed at her, was condescension from several male co-workers. "The script doesn't flinch on that issue, and I'm proud of that," said Ms. Bassett. "It's a sad fact that some of Rosa's colleagues in the movement simply couldn't accept the fact that a woman was having such an impact. They were great men, but they had the faults of their times." Mr. Brinkley quotes Mrs. Parks's former N.A.A.C.P. boss, Mr. Nixon, as calling her "a lovely, stupid woman the media built into an icon." And ministers whom she respected greeted her with "Well, if it isn't the superstar." Even her own husband, Raymond, an early N.A.A.C.P. activist, was initially apprehensive about his wife's involvement in a movement that was being greeted by an increasingly violent opposition. 
 "Raymond and Rosa eventually weathered the storm together," said Ms. Bassett. "It's one of the great love stories I've ever heard of, and I think we would have failed in this movie if we didn't show how their faith and love affected the politics of the movement and, eventually, history."

HEADLINE: Fantasy Lands' Ailing Turnstiles 

BYLINE:  By JAMES STERNGOLD; JAMES STERNGOLD is a national correspondent in Los Angeles for The Times.

 BODY:
THEME parks may derive their appeal from fantastic visions seemingly detached from any real sense of time or place, but Sept. 11 brought home the reality of how rooted these destinations can be in the here and now.
 With air travel going into a steep slump after the terrorist attacks, the parks that depend most on visitors from afar saw their attendance figures drop sharply. Then there was the gnawing recession, taking another bite out of the businesses. In fact, business had already been soft at some of the largest theme parks before Sept. 11 as families cut down on spending. 
 But now that estimates of 2001 attendance are available, and the amusement companies are better able to assess their prospects, a bit of the gloom has lifted, certainly for many of the nation's smaller amusement parks. 
At some parks where attendance declined sharply after the attacks, business has improved slowly. While it may have not risen to the levels expected a year ago, it is better than in the period just after the attacks. And regional parks, which depend on stay-at-homes for their business, have actually enjoyed a modest upswing, officials of those parks say.
In fact, the gap dividing the traditional sides of the theme park business appears to have widened. The bigger so-called destination parks, like Disneyland or Universal Studios, which derive a significant portion of their business from people who fly in from hundreds or thousands of miles away, have suffered the most.
"That has always been the trend in this industry, and it just became more pronounced this time around," said Susie Storey, the spokeswoman for the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions, a trade group that represents most big parks. "All the parks have told us they aren't where they wanted to be, but it's been worse for the destination parks."
According to Amusement Business, a trade publication, attendance at Disneyland, in Anaheim, Calif., dropped 11 percent in 2001 from the previous year, 15 percent at Epcot, in Lake Buena Vista, Fla., 10 percent at Universal Studios Orlando, 9 percent at Universal Studios Hollywood, 6 percent at Disney-MGM Studios, near Orlando, and 4 percent at Magic Kingdom at Disney World.
The slowing economy last year and the toll taken by Sept. 11 were evident at the California Adventure park at Disneyland. The park, seeking to increase spending by its visitors, had arranged a contract with Wolfgang Puck to operate an expensive seafood restaurant called Avalon Cove. But it was doing poorly, and in November Disney took over the management and changed the menu to more mainstream American cuisine. In addition, the Robert Mondavi company had operated the Vineyard Room restaurant at Golden Vine Winery, a theme pavilion at the park. It was another upscale restaurant that was not performing well, so Disney also took over its management late last year.
Experiencing far more success are the regional parks, whose customers overwhelmingly come from within about 200 miles, and drive. They frequently make day trips, and so concentrate their spending inside the parks, rather than at hotels or restaurants outside.
Those visits seem like cheaper alternatives to more elaborate vacations that involve flying. So in times of stress, both psychic and economic, they have benefited, officials say.
For instance, at SeaWorld San Diego -- which gets some visitors from great distances, but relies mostly on regional traffic -- business increased 13 percent in 2001, according to Amusement Business. Paramount's Kings Island, in Ohio, was up 4 percent, Morey's Piers, in Wildwood, N.J., was up 3 percent, Six Flags Over Texas was up 8 percent, and Busch Gardens The Old Country, in Williamsburg, Va., which introduced a theme area called Ireland, had a 17 percent rise in attendance.
VISITORS to many of those parks have benefited from promotions used to keep attendance figures up. For instance, SeaWorld San Diego allowed visitors who bought a full-price day ticket between January and April to return as many days as they wanted last year for free. The deal is in effect again this year. And at California Adventure in Anaheim, now part of the Disneyland Resort, adults got in at the children's price from late June to early September last year while those 9 and under got in free. At the 10 largest theme parks in the country, concentrated in Florida and Southern California, attendance dropped by 7 million, to a total of about 80 million. But the good outweighed the bad over all, because of the larger number of smaller regional parks.
According to the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions, business over all managed a slight increase in 2001, to 319 million in attendance from 317 million in 2000 at the 450 parks in the United States and abroad, and revenues were flat for the year at $9.6 billion. Ms. Storey said that, while the destination parks traditionally do better in good times, in part because of their bigger marketing budgets, smaller parks have held steadier in tough economic times, and that was true last year.
She added that there has been one solid sign that the companies are still relatively optimistic. Buying was still strong at the organization's recent annual trade show in Orlando, Fla., where the companies make some of their largest capital investments, purchasing everything from roller coasters and other spiffy new rides to slick costumes and prizes. She said the organization does not have statistics on purchases, but noted that big ticket acquisitions were continuing. 
"You don't put a lot of money into a Super Soaker unless you think people are going to be using it," Ms. Storey said.
Legoland California, an offshoot of the company that makes Lego toys, is one of the few companies that demonstrated both trends under one roof. The park, located in Carlsbad, in northern San Diego County, gets about 70 percent of its attendance from Southern California (some of it as a result of spillover from Disneyland, about one hour to the north), 10 percent from Northern California, 5 percent from Arizona and about 15 percent from everywhere else.
"Immediately after Sept. 11 that air traffic just went away," said Courtney Simmons, a spokeswoman for Legoland.
So the park began some aggressive marketing, with second-day-free ticket deals, and it took a difficult step, announcing on Jan. 7 that it was going to close Tuesdays and Wednesdays in the off season. After three years of operation, the park will now be shut 66 days a year, allowing it to save some money.
"We just couldn't justify staying open 365 days a year any longer," Ms. Simmons said, adding that the economy had already been a problem before the terrorist attacks.
She said, though, that even with the economy slowing further, regional traffic picked up by late September to the degree that, though attendance is still down, revenues are steady because people are spending more once they get inside the park.
Legoland's attendance fell nearly 6 percent last year, to 1.36 million from 1.45 million in 2000, and in 2002 officials expect attendance to remain the same, even with a shorter week.
Elsewhere, the improvements toward the end of 2001 have led most companies to abandon the most dire projections.
"We had a strong holiday season and the numbers are continuing to rebound a bit," said Tom Brocato, the spokesman for Disneyland and its new California Adventure sidekick attraction. "We're hopeful the numbers will continue to go upward in 2002."
But, as a number of industry officials pointed out, the timing of the attacks didn't have as profound an impact as it would if they had occurred earlier in the summer, because most amusement parks close shortly after Labor Day and do not reopen until Memorial Day. So by the time the lights go back on later this year the initial trauma of the terrorist attacks will have abated for most people and, officials hope, the economy will be slowly swinging back up.
"We don't kick off our season for another six weeks or so, and our parks were just about closed already on Sept. 11," said Gerry Soud, the spokesman for Paramount Parks, a unit of Viacom, which owns five regional amusement parks in the United States and Canada, including Kings Island in Ohio, Kings Dominion in Virginia, and Great America in Northern California.
"So we had a strong year and this year should be O.K., too," he added.
And some companies, even those that get a modest portion of their business from fliers, managed to beat the odds entirely. One was Busch Entertainment Corporation, owned by Anheuser-Busch. Its holdings include Busch Gardens and SeaWorld parks.
"We ended up doing great over all and we feel very bullish about 2002," said Bob Tucker, a spokesman for SeaWorld San Diego.
With 4.1 million visitors last year, it set a record. The attendance figures were helped, Mr. Tucker said, by aggressive promotions, including one in which visitors buying a full-priced day ticket could come back for as many days as they liked.
The real test will be this summer, Mr. Tucker said.

HEADLINE: Ding, Dong, the Cultural Witch Hunt Is Dead 

BYLINE:  By Frank Rich; Frank Rich is a columnist for The Times and a senior writer for the magazine.

 BODY:
These days we look back at the projectile name-calling and nonstop sexual revelations that defined Washington's all-consuming culture war of the 1990's and ask: What in hell was that all about? Like the reigning sitcom of the time, "Seinfeld," it may have been about nothing, or at least very little -- and with a Lilliputian cast of characters to match. In retrospect, the archetypal figure of 90's Washington may not have been one of its many aspiring Woodwards and Bernsteins or a great man or woman of state (were there any?) who will some day get the David McCullough treatment, but a gossip-mongering schlemiel who is already halfway to being an answer on "Jeopardy." 
 David Brock, you may recall, was the bullying reporter for the late, not-so-great American Spectator who labeled Anita Hill "a little bit nutty and a little bit slutty" and later broke Troopergate, the pioneering expose (much of it culled from clandestinely paid "sources") into Bill Clinton's Arkansas Kama Sutra. In his latest incarnation, Brock is turning expiation for these and other past sins into a second career that has played out like a striptease over the past few years. He set out on this path in 1997 by writing an article for Esquire, "Confessions of a Right-Wing Hit Man," in which he started to recant "The Real Anita Hill," his best-selling and often fictionalized hatchet job that duped many reviewers (including one at The New York Times) with its lavishly footnoted gossip, half-truths and slander. 
Next up is a new book, a memoir titled "Blinded by the Right: The Conscience of an Ex-Conservative," that goes further still by serving as a mea culpa for an entire era, not just himself. In it, he not only takes back the falsifications in his reportage on Hill, Clarence Thomas and the Clintons (among others) but even offers an apologia for the over-the-top excesses of his Esquire apologia, which was accompanied by a photo of Brock in full martyr monty, lashed to a tree, his chest bared, eager to be burned at a stake. 
 Though I've had my own journalistic battles with Brock, I've never met him. He may be best observed at a distance. He calls his new memoir a "terrible book" in its very first sentence, but he's wrong about that as he has been about so much else during his bizarre, chameleonlike career. His book is terrible only in the sense that it takes us back to a poisonous time. Whatever critics may make of it when it's published next month, it may be a key document for historians seeking to understand the ethos of the incoherent 90's. It is also easier to warm up to than the rest of the Brock canon, much of which was written in spittle-spewing blind rage. 
The Brock of "Blinded by the Right" is instead humorously circumspect. There's an Albert Brooks-in-Broadcast News" moment when he describes how he tried, as a rising young conservative talking head, to imitate the "magnificent half-recline" of William F. Buckley's television posture only to "nearly fall off my chair." To ingratiate himself with a conservative elite presided over by the likes of Arnaud de Borchgrave, a self-styled journalistic grandee in the toadying employ of the Rev. Sun Myung Moon at The Washington Times, Brock writes of endeavoring "to look like an old fogy in training, donning a bow tie and horn-rimmed glasses and, ludicrously, puffing on a pipe and occasionally even carrying a walking stick." A Commentary action figure, in other words. 
Brock's publisher has billed Brock's confession as a memoir "in the tradition of Arthur Koestler's 'God That Failed,"' but what makes the book an apt postscript to the dim decade it describes is how little it has in common with Koestler's disavowal of Communism, or Whittaker Chambers's "Witness," or the rest of the vast modern literature of ideological about-face. Ideology, like goodness, had little to do with the politics of the 1990's. The cold war was over, Clinton embraced a centrism that was echt Rockefeller Republican, prosperity was on the march and nothing serious seemed at stake (or so we thought at the time). Brock's book can't recount an ideological journey because there's little evidence he was a committed conservative in the first place -- or that many of his ambitious allies were, either -- any more than he (or the Clintonistas he now aligns himself with) is a committed liberal now. And that's the point. 
His story exemplifies a decade of post-ideological drift and spitball politics in Washington: a cynical, highly pragmatic struggle over power more than ideas that opened with the Thomas-Hill confrontation of 1991, reached its climax with the impeachment drive and now seems to have been interred with so much else in the rubble of Sept. 11. It was a time of take-no-prisoners mudslinging, in which the Republican right, with no Communists to unmask, found a new kind of enemy within that it tried to bring down by means of a disingenuously holier-than-thou moral crusade fueled by a gossip machine of which Brock was an early and influential cog. The hottest partisan battles revolved around Long Dong Silver and Paula Jones, not Stalin.
For the right, the principal means of battle was a kind of cultural profiling that slick (and entirely secular) political operatives adapted from their allies in the religious right. If Anita Hill could be painted as nutty and slutty, if the Democratic leader Tom Foley could be called gay (even if he wasn't) and if Bill Clinton could be branded as a pot-smoking libertine from Day 1 of his presidency, then liberals in general and Democrats in particular could be dubbed, as Newt Gingrich would have it, "the enemy of normal Americans," responsible for every moral breach in the nation. In Gingrich's formulation, "The left-wing Democrats will represent the party of total hedonism, total exhibitionism, total bizarreness, total weirdness." On his way to becoming speaker of the House, he even grandfathered Susan Smith's 1994 drowning of her two children in South Carolina into 60's hedonism, as an example of the "pattern" of "the counterculture and Lyndon Johnson's Great Society." 
There wasn't much intellectual content to this debased and often histrionic line of cultural attack; it was to a serious debate over values what McCarthyism was to anti-Communism. But the triumph of Reaganism and the passing of its architects from the front lines left a vacuum that had to be filled. As Brock explains: "Political movements arise from the spadework of intellectuals, not politicians. The older generation of conservative intellectuals who had framed the political culture that brought Reagan to power and sustained his administration -- the Norman Podhoretzes, the Charles Murrays, the theorists of supply-side economics at the Wall Street Journal editorial page -- were spent. Whatever one thought of their ideas, they were serious thinkers, and there was no one of their caliber to replace them." 
Their noisiest successors, the prominent younger conservatives of Brock's Washington generation, had little aspiration to do any intellectual heavy lifting of the sort once conducted by a Buckley or Irving Kristol, whether in book form or in the pages of small-circulation journals like The Public Interest. Rather than fight (or work hard) in the trenches of the academy whose political correctness they professed to loathe, the new conservatives preferred to become what might be called welfare deans; they collected academic-sounding titles that required intellectual output in almost inverse proportion to their financing by right-wing foundations. A Richard Mellon Scaife-financed talk-show bloviator and cut-and-paste writer like William Bennett, rather than a practicing, untelegenic intellectual like James Q. Wilson, was the role model. Even Brock, with no advanced degrees or particular expertise in the subject, was early in his career christened John M. Olin Fellow in Congressional Studies at the Heritage Foundation. The main aspiration of his Washington pack was to churn out quick, slashing character assassinations or screeds (for which "The Real Anita Hill" and Rush Limbaugh's "Way Things Ought to Be" became the ur-texts) and to achieve celebrity in the new medium of cable TV news, a phenomenon whose rapid growth in the 90's, like that of the Drudge-fueled Internet, paralleled the rise of the mudslinging right and was essential to the dissemination of unsubstantiated dirt. 
By his own account, Brock has lied so often that a reader can't take on faith some of the juicier newsbreaks from the impeachment era in his book, including his portrayal of the murky role supposedly played by Theodore Olson, now the Bush administration's solicitor general, in the doomed "Arkansas Project," in which The American Spectator spent millions of Scaife's dollars to try to link the Clintons to any and every sexual shenanigan, drug scheme and murder that ever happened within hailing distance of Little Rock. What makes Brock's tale effective is his insider's portrait of a political slime operation, much of it comic from even this slight historical remove, about which the facts already exist for the most part on the public record -- and sometimes on the legal record as well. (For what it's worth, his accounts of events in which I figured are accurate.)
The literary antecedent for "Blinded by the Right" is less "The God That Failed" than Julia Phillips's scorched-earth memoir of Hollywood, "You'll Never Eat Lunch in This Town Again." But Brock, unlike Phillips, can write, and he seems to have expelled much of the bile that marked his past writing. In his portrayal, there are some honorable and principled conservatives who cross his path -- John O'Sullivan of The National Review (which had the guts to pan "The Real Anita Hill"), Tod Lindberg of The Washington Times, the writer Christopher Caldwell -- and there's a humanity to some (though not all) of the gargoyles and lunatics who outnumber them. R. Emmett Tyrrell Jr., the editor who exploited Brock's "investigative journalism" to increase exponentially The American Spectator's circulation and then overreached to the point of losing his magazine altogether, is such a colorful, self-destructive and at times generous eccentric that it's hard to hate him even as he plays editorial muse to all the Clinton-haters. He's a nut, perhaps, but with a soft Dickensian center.
What makes history that seemed ugly at the time play like farce now is the almost unending hypocrisy of so many of Brock's circle in journalism and politics. Those who led the charge against the morality of Anita Hill, Bill Clinton and the rest were almost to a man and woman living in glasshouses of their own, whether pursuing sex, alcohol, abortion or some combination thereof. The checkered "family values" of the likes of Gingrich, Scaife, Dan Burton, Henry Hyde, Bob Livingston and The Wall Street Journal's anti-Clinton polemicist John Fund, among many others, are now part of the historical record. Clarence Thomas's history of regularly renting pornography in the 1980's -- documented by the Wall Street Journal reporters Jane Mayer and Jill Abramson (Abramson is now the Washington bureau chief of The Times) in their book "Strange Justice" -- also stands virtually unchallenged, now that Brock has withdrawn his previous rebuttal of it. It's particularly hilarious that The Washington Times was the paper of record (and of frequent employment) for this whole pious crowd, given that its owner, Moon, with his mass weddings of mostly strangers, probably took more direct action to undermine the institution of marriage in America than any single person in the 20th century, the Gabor sisters included. 
For a political movement that wanted to police sexual "lifestyles" and was pathologically obsessed with trying to find evidence that Hillary Clinton was a lesbian, the New Right of the 90's was, in Brock's account, nearly as gay as a soiree in Fire Island Pines. Even before Brock publicly acknowledged his own homosexuality at the height of his fame, he tapped into a Washington subculture of closeted conservatives that seemed to hold forth everywhere from The American Spectator to the closest circles around Gingrich and Kenneth Starr. There is, of course, a long history of usually closeted gay men, some but not all of them public homophobes, on the American right, including Roy Cohn, J. Edgar Hoover and such top Reagan-era operatives as Terry Dolan, Marvin Liebman and even Jesse Helms's political consultant, Arthur Finkelstein. The same goes for such intellectual patron saints of conservatism as Chambers and Allan Bloom. But that's just the short list. When Brock revealed his homosexuality, he expected to be hit with bigotry from his publicly antigay allies, but to his surprise was at first more often hit on instead. At a party at his Georgetown home, "the house that Anita Hill built," he had to eject a conservative columnist "after he pushed me onto a bed, into a pile of coats, and tried to stick his tongue down my throat." There is also, among others, "the closeted pro-impeachment Republican congressman, who had pursued me drunkenly through a black-tie Washington dinner offering a flower he had plucked from a bud vase, condemning Clinton for demeaning his office." It all plays like slapstick out of "The Birdcage."
Why would a conservative movement so obsessed with vilifying homosexuality as a subversive "lifestyle" contain so many homosexuals? Looking at his own past, Brock writes, "The doctrinaire absolutism, the thunderous extremism, the wildness of expression -- these qualities were not uncommon among other closeted right-wing homosexuals I had known. . . . At the bottom of my rage there must have been a loathing not of liberals, but of myself. By giving voice to their hatred of Anita Hill, I was trying to force the conservatives to love a faggot whether they liked it or not." Certainly after reading Brock's account, you're left feeling that too many of those protesting about homosexuality are protesting too much -- not necessarily because they're gay themselves in the manner of the cliched militaristic neighbor of "American Beauty" but either because they may be angry to discover that their children are (as in the case of Phyllis Schlafly) or, most conventionally, because they may be politically jealous of the clout of the tight-knit cliques of gays on their own team. (The numerous gays in "the seniormost ranks of the Reagan administration called themselves the 'laissez fairies,"' writes Brock.) A similarly self-destructive overcompensation -- the eternal Jimmy Swaggart syndrome -- seemed to be at work among the straight right-wing womanizers, like Gingrich, who led the charge against Democratic hedonism while engaging in their own.
What's clear now is that David Brock's mea culpa for this era may also be its epitaph. The holier-than-thou cultural profiling used by Gingrich, Brock and their peers in the Hill-Thomas-Clinton era is in serious decline as a political tool. The proximate causes of its demise can be found in the immediate aftermath of Sept. 11. The televised testimony by Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson to the effect that America was attacked in part because it gives safe harbor to "the pagans and the abortionists and the gays and the lesbians" was renounced by virtually the entire country, up to and including Rush Limbaugh and President Bush. Cultural profiling took an equally dramatic hit when the first leader to emerge in the postattack aftermath proved to be a walking compendium of the attributes that horrified the lifestyle police of the Clinton years: Rudolph Giuliani, a married man who publicly abandoned his wife for a mistress and chose to live in the household of a gay couple. He was a Republican, besides. So was one of the attack's first heroes -- Mark Bingham, a gay rugby player believed to be one of those who fought the hijackers for control of Flight 93 before it crashed in Pennsylvania. Suddenly the pre-Sept. 11 game of "gotcha" with Gary Condit (another hypocrite who piously supported the impeachment inquiry) seemed to belong to a vanished age.
In the months since the attack on America there have been some efforts on what remains of the Brockian right to revive the old culture wars. The biggest push has been to turn John Walker Lindh into an exemplar of the 60's, much as Gingrich did with Susan Smith. But as the effort to pin Smith's murders on the left failed -- it later turned out that she was the stepdaughter of a Christian Coalition official (and Pat Robertson-for-president supporter) who had molested her from age 15 -- so the pin-Lindh-on-liberals effort has waned. 
The case was most prominently laid out on The Wall Street Journal editorial page, a knee-jerk home to cultural profiling of this sort, by the conservative Hoover Institution scholar Shelby Steele, who said the American Taliban recruit exemplified "a certain cultural liberalism" to be found in Northern California -- never mind that Steele also lives there (the Hoover Institution is at Stanford University), as did a hero like Flight 93's Mark Bingham (who was from San Francisco). To drive his point home, Steele also invoked Cornel West (though he misspelled his name) and noted that Lindh was a child of divorce, was named after John Lennon, had read "The Autobiography of Malcolm X" and went to an alternative school. Unfortunately, to make his case, Steele had to glide by the reality that the anti-American creed of the Taliban was as far removed from San Francisco liberalism as one could imagine -- an antiwoman, antigay fundamentalist sect. Steele also had to ignore the fact that Lindh had spent the first and more formative half of his childhood not in Marin County but in Takoma Park, Md., a Washington suburb, where he and his family were then regular Catholic churchgoers. 
It shows the arbitrariness of Steele's case that he would probably have had an easier time arguing that Catholicism turns Americans into traitors -- since at least he'd have another example to go with Lindh in Robert Hanssen, the F.B.I. mole who was one of the most effective spies in American history and a rigorous member of the conservative Catholic sect Opus Dei. But of course that argument would have been as silly as the one Steele did make. Post-Sept. 11, choosing cultural profiling as a political weapon can lead to incoherence, if not absurdity. In a recent issue of The Weekly Standard, for instance, one article tried to pin Lindh's defection to the Taliban on the alleged homosexuality of his father (while carefully ignoring the boy's Catholic background) while another tried earnestly to examine Hanssen's defection to the Soviet Union by focusing on his Catholicism. 
Most Americans believe that Lindh and Hanssen are each sui generis -- anomalous case studies that cannot be pinned on any particular cultural influence, family constellation, religion or sexual history. That's why the efforts of the last practitioners of 90's cultural profiling fall flat. Most Americans also know by now that for better or worse both Thomas and Bill Clinton are going to be judged by history for what they did in their official capacities, not for what porn they watched or enacted. 
This isn't to say that witch hunts ever become extinct in American politics; they only go into remission. But in the meantime, we're so removed from the political fisticuffs that made a star out of David Brock that the landscape is at times unrecognizable. As you watch those on the right look the other way at Rudy Giuliani's sex life, it almost seems as if they are flirting with what they used to hate most -- touchy-feely cultural relativism. You know the ground has shifted when the one prominent legal lion to feel "empathy and sympathy" for John Walker Lindh -- and to argue that he be treated not as "a Benedict Arnold" but as a "young kid with misplaced idealism" -- is Kenneth Starr.

Vote of Confidence at the Long Island Association

BYLINE:  By WARREN STRUGATCH 

 BODY:
FORMER President Bill Clinton waited patiently for his time in the spotlight as some 1,300 guests began to realize they would have to wait a few minutes longer to hear him speak. Matthew T. Crosson, the embattled president of the Long Island Association, took the microphone and for once did not quickly hand it over to the day's invited headliner.
 Normally a cool dispenser of facts rather than an oratorical stirrer of emotions, Mr. Crosson added more verbal flourishes than has been his style. He began by quoting from another president, Franklin D. Roosevelt, assuring his audience that they had nothing to fear but fear itself. He stressed the importance of remaining steadfast in the face of adversity. "The soul of the association is not and never will be timid," he said. 
 There was no question but that he felt himself redeemed, after much speculation that he might have outworn his welcome. The last year had largely been a string of public sparring matches. Mr. Crosson took on former deputies, onetime allies, a growing number of influential business leaders and some of his own association members. He began the new year by scolding Governor Pataki, then confronted two state senators who took up for him. 
Accordingly, the association's annual meeting on Feb. 15, held as usual at the Crest Hollow Country Club in Woodbury and normally a monument to choreographed placidity, was electric with anticipation. Not only was a former president of the United States on hand, but members would find out whether the association's directors had renewed Mr. Crosson's contract for another year.
Edward Travaglianti, the group's chairman, ended the speculation, announcing that the board had voted unanimously in Mr. Crosson's favor. Several of those present said that Mr. Travaglianti, the president of commercial markets at Citibank, praised Mr. Crosson for his outspokenness and willingness to endure criticism in remarks that seemed intended to put to rest all speculation about Mr. Crosson's future at the association.
Neither Mr. Travaglianti nor Mr. Crosson returned three phone calls and were said to be on vacation. Gary Wojtas, the association's communications director, barred some 30 reporters and cameramen from the room during Mr. Travaglianti's comments.
The sudden erosion of Mr. Crosson's standing seemed puzzling. Until last year, anyone critical of him or of the Long Island Association, the largest business group on the Island with more than 5,500 companies and organizations as members and a budget approaching $5 million, wisely refrained from public comment. Such was Mr. Crosson's reputation for tolerating little in the way of dissent.
All that changed last year as a series of miscues seemed to turn Mr. Crosson's Teflon into tissue paper. It began entirely innocuously. During the spring and summer months a former assistant to Mr. Crosson, Peter Goldsmith, began building a business group for high-tech executives -- a group that Mr. Crosson had helped him start -- into a serious rival to the parent association.
Mr. Goldsmith then formed an alliance with the Long Island Forum for Technology, an organization aimed at providing technical training for engineers, and thus reinforced, began competing with his former employer for government money. Last year, Mr. Goldsmith's group, the Long Island Technology Network, landed a state training grant worth over $1 million, leaving Mr. Crosson, who had publicly asserted the association's entitlement to the grant, with egg on his face.
There were other miscalculations. Mr. Crosson founded a staffing service that ended up competing with some of the association's own members, leaving a number of them resentful and suspicious. He continued to scold government officials publicly, including H. Carl McCall, the state comptroller.
Such words are usually exchanged behind closed doors, and other politicians began baiting Mr. Crosson in the media. A Newsday reporter asked him in print if he were running for governor. The ensuing fuss left at least some political insiders wondering if Mr. Crosson had lost his political acumen.
It's perhaps no surprise that former President Clinton, once he finally got a chance to speak at the annual meeting, had something to say about the matter of political endurance.
"It's nice meeting someone not restricted to term limits" was how he put it. 
But term limits were never Mr. Crosson's concern. Perception was, and the perception that Matt Crosson could no longer count on the allegiance of the region's power players had spread like coffee spilled on a white dress shirt. It is this support, unquestioning and reflexive, that provides the authority to shape the region's economic future, as Mr. Crosson has done for the past nine years.
Others contend that the association's very emphasis on politics -- which began long before Mr. Crosson came to Long Island -- was itself part of the problem.
Ellen Cooperperson, an organizational consultant in East Northport, said that she had attended about four meetings in the 20 years she has been a member of the Long Island Association. "I perceive the group as a very political organization that is rather closed to divergent points of view," she said. "What I look for from an organization is the opportunity to exchange information about business and the economy, especially among various points of view. I think Long Island needs an organization like that, and it isn't the L.I.A."
In an attempt to meet this and other needs, LIX, a group of young managers, professionals and entrepreneurs, has sprung up and has irreverently promoted itself by handing out cigars and offering free shaves. 
"A number of people simply feel that the Long Island Association takes a terribly arrogant approach in the way it deals with individuals and other organizations," said Jeffrey Bass, the chairman of the Long Island Venture Group, a nonprofit venture-capital organization that let its membership in the L.I.A. lapse last year. "They were not respectful of our organization, and that's been true of the way they deal with many organizations on Long Island. It's been true for years that if you want their support, in essence you have to be willing to become just another one of their committees." 
Even some of Mr. Crosson's long-time supporters acknowledge that he has made enemies. "The criticism has been that Matt is overbearing," said Lee E. Koppelman, the executive director of the Long Island Regional Planning Board. "This is something that cannot be denied."
Stan Henry, a radio station owner and an association director since 1996, said: "I left the meeting thinking that he got, and deerved, the support of the board. I think Matt Crosson is an extremely intelligent and capable man."
Mr. Crosson's problems had never extended to the board, Mr. Henry said. "Matt's problem was with the politicians, because he spoke out on the issues," he said. "It was only in their heads. When you do business with politicians, they don't want you to make waves. When you do, the first thing they do is accuse you of being a politician yourself."

HEADLINE: Dillon and Spitzer Clash Over Abortion 

BYLINE:  By NANCY H. TILGHMAN 

DATELINE: DEER PARK 

 BODY:
MIECCIA WEBB is 26 and eight months pregnant with her second child. She lives in Wyandanch and is unemployed and unmarried. When she was pregnant three years ago, she thought about abortion. At the beginning of her second unplanned pregnancy, she thought about abortion again.
 But after counseling at the Life Center of Long Island in Deer Park, she decided to have her second baby. "Being there, when you see all the baby stuff, you are pregnant, you go through the feelings," she said. 
 Lorraine Gariboldi, executive director of the Deer Park center, counts Ms. Webb's case as a hard-won success. "Our volunteers have walked her though her pregnancy on a daily basis," Ms. Gariboldi said. "In this business, at any given time, we might have one or two Mieccias. She is a very needy client. They are very demanding with their needs. We did pay for her security deposit for her apartment."
Francesca Angelo has been the medical director of the Family Planning Center in Mineola for more than 16 years. She has seen it all, she said: women who are pregnant and don't want an abortion; women who are confused; women who need an abortion within hours. She has endured relentless protesters on the sidewalk outside her window at work. She has had threatening messages left on her answering machine. She said she had even been held hostage by anti-abortion protesters. But she has never been inside a so-called "crisis pregnancy center," one of the counseling services operated by anti-abortion activists.
"We used to have a crisis pregnancy center right down the block," Ms. Angelo said. "Women would go in thinking they were going to get help, but in reality they were telling them, 'No, you can't do this. You have to go to an adoption agency.' Then they would come to us."
One such place, the Life Center in Deer Park, is now at the center of a stormy disagreement between the Nassau County district attorney, Denis Dillon, a Republican and anti-abortion campaigner, and the state attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, a Democrat who supports abortion rights. Mr. Spitzer recently issued subpoenas to 11 crisis pregnancy centers in the state after investigating the business practices of 24 of these centers.
One of the subpoenas singled out the Deer Park center, where Mr. Dillon serves on the board. He called a news conference in his office on Feb. 6 to urge Mr. Spitzer to "back off from his heavy-handed harassment of pro-life pregnancy centers." 
Mr. Spitzer responded that under a 1995 consent decree, the Life Center in Deer Park and other crisis pregnancy centers had agreed that they would not misrepresent the services they provide.
"They have to say that they do not provide abortions and that they do not administer pregnancy tests," said Darren Dopp, communications director for the state attorney general's office. "These centers are in the business of convincing women not to have an abortion, but they have to be careful about the way they do it."
Mr. Dopp said the investigation was prompted by recent complaints from women who have called and visited crisis pregnancy centers, including the one in Deer Park.
"In the Deer Park facility we are focused on the pregnancy testing," Mr. Dopp said. "There could have been deceptive information when calls were placed to the facility."
While denying any impropriety, Ms. Gariboldi acknowledged that her center did offer pregnancy tests. "It is a urine test, but it is one that someone can buy in the drugstore," she said.
She added that the Deer Park center also referred patients to a local obstetric gynecological office in Deer Park or Huntington for sonograms.
Ms. Gariboldi said the Deer Park center counseled 200 women a month, had a staff of 80 volunteers who help donate food and baby clothing, and received $600,000 in private contributions last year.
Some critics of the crisis pregnancy centers frame the issue as whether the centers try to offer impartial counseling to pregnant women, or whether they view their mission as persuading women not to have an abortion.
Defenders of the centers dismiss that argument. "If you advertise yourself as an abortion alternative and you are an advocacy group, then you are not bound to present women's choices," said Kathy Faber-Langendoen, a professor of bioethics at SUNY Upstate Medical University in Syracuse. "If you walk into the N.R.A. you don't expect to hear about gun control." 
Ms. Angelo said that by helping to pay some pregnant women's household bills, crisis pregnancy centers seek to improperly influence indigent, uneducated women.
Planned Parenthood, which has three centers in Nassau County and six in Suffolk County, offers women prenatal care, adoption services and abortion as a part of what they term "full-option counseling" for pregnant women. Karen Pearl, executive director of Planned Parenthood Nassau County, said they have had pregnant women come to Planned Parenthood after having unpleasant experiences at crisis pregnancy centers.
"They are very upfront," Ms. Pearl said of the crisis pregnancy centers. "They will not talk to a woman about all her options at a very vulnerable time."
She said having sonograms was a clever strategy to persuade women not to have an abortion when abortion might be their best alternative.
"Sonograms should be used as a medical diagnostic tool, and we believe they are using sonograms to manipulate the patient's decision," Ms. Pearl said. "They are using a medical test as a coercive tactic."
Ms. Angelo said, "The bottom line is no woman is going to want an abortion after she sees a sonogram."
In 27 years in office, Mr. Dillon has walked a fine line in separating his public duties from his anti-abortion activities as a private citizen. Since the late 1980's, he has had an arrangement transferring prosecutions of Nassau County abortion protesters to the Suffolk County district attorney's office. With little criticism, he has publicly endorsed nonviolent anti-abortion activities like trespassing, and Nassau County police officials have said they were leery of making arrests in abortion protest cases because they know they will get no support from the district attorney's office.
But Mr. Dillon was criticized for using his office for the news conference at which he defended the Deer Park center.
"Why is he holding a news conference in his office?" Mr. Dopp asked. "Is he acting as a district attorney or as a board member for the crisis pregnancy center in a different county? Who is Denis Dillon?"
Mr. Dillon's supporters said Mr. Spitzer used his official position in the same way.
"In January he spoke at a Naral luncheon about how he was going to keep women's reproductive rights safe by investigating these crisis centers," Ms. Gariboldi said. Naral is the National Abortion Rights Action League.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
ConsumersHave Saved The Day. Well, Maybe.

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
SKEPTICISM about the economy is becoming harder to sustain. The latest statistics are too hopeful. They increasingly suggest that recession is giving way to recovery, although the three most important statistics -- business investment, corporate profits and production capacity -- have yet to go in the right direction. Until they do, the incipient recovery will have no legs.
 But that is tomorrow's hurdle. Responding to the unmistakable symptoms of a reviving economy, the nation's forecasters have put aside skepticism. Forecasters who still say the economy is contracting are hard to find. Consumer spending has held up far too well. Soon, the forecasters argue, the other engines of growth will kick in. 
 Richard Berner, chief domestic economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, shows the current mood. "The United States," he said, "is soon likely to lead the rest of the world out of recession just as we led them into it." To Mr. Berner, the economy is already expanding at a healthy clip, and in the second half of the year, growth will surge at a 4.5 percent annual rate, reminiscent of the late 1990's.
Consumer spending has indeed held up beyond most everyone's expectations. Despite crushing debt, endless layoffs and a scarcity of new jobs, families have kept spending. Millions behave as if the recession was someone else's experience, not theirs. Personal consumption expenditures, the government's calculation of total consumer outlays, rose in each of the last three quarters, particularly in the most recent, in disregard of the recession. 
"What surprised everyone was that the consumer did not flee," said James Glassman, an economist at J.P. Morgan Chase.
The current quarter is producing another strong showing from consumers. Retail sales data through last week was robust. Now the forecasters are optimistically expecting the next shoe to drop. Thanks to all the consumption, companies have run down their inventories of unsold goods to unusually low levels. Restocking is imminent, the forecasters say. Restocking, in turn, requires stepped-up production, and when that happens, the recovery is on its way -- unless consumption falters.
A little skepticism is in order here. Why has consumer spending held up so well? There are several reasons, none of them all that solid. 
Bargains have played an important role. In past recessions, rising prices inhibited consumers. This time, the inflation rate is hardly noticeable; price-cutting has been widespread -- zero-interest auto loans being only one example. "Consumers overcame their caution about the economy because they thought prices were so low they would never get a better bargain," said Richard T. Curtin, director of the University of Michigan's Surveys of Consumers. 
Low interest rates have also encouraged spending. So have falling fuel prices. As rates fell, mortgage refinancing put billions of dollars into the pockets of homeowners without raising their monthly payments.
The problem is that none of these factors are likely to repeat themselves. And hourly wages, while still rising smartly in the fourth quarter, have begun to show signs of faltering as unemployment moves higher.
"Wages are the last domino to fall," said Jared Bernstein, a labor economist at the Economic Policy Institute. "The progression is weak economic growth, rising unemployment and then wages lose ground."
BARGAIN prices are also a burden. To restore profits, companies must either raise prices or cut costs, particularly labor costs, even more than they already have. Either way, consumer spending is endangered. But without the prospect of rising profits, companies are unlikely to revive investment in new machinery, computers and the other tools of production. Without that revival, the incipient economic upturn is likely to vanish.
Recognizing this hole in their optimism, many forecasters express confidence that capital spending will pick up by late summer. By then, they say, overcapacity will have disappeared. American companies will no longer have more tools than they need to satisfy demand, and capital spending will resume.
Maybe. Or maybe, instead of recovery, there will be a second dip into recession. One or two forecasters mention this double dip and are hooted down by their colleagues. That only goads Stephen S. Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley, to fresh expressions of doubt.
"As America's sole surviving double dipper," he said, "I would concede that the numbers have broken to the upside temporarily. But that has happened in past recessions, only to give way to fresh hard times. Skepticism should not be suspended."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: NEW YORK UP CLOSE -- BUZZ; 
New Cigarette Tax? Young Smokers Just Shrug

BYLINE:  By DENNY LEE 

 BODY:
THE SETTING -- The smoky back streets behind the Dalton School, on East 89th Street near Park Avenue. Students huddled in their overcoats last Wednesday, stealing puffs of cigarettes between classes and after school, dutifully respecting the school's no-smoking zone out front.
 The teenagers had many opinions about the $1.50 city cigarette tax proposed by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. The jump in the tax -- it is now just 8 cents -- is intended both to ease the city's budget deficit and to reduce smoking by raising prices to nearly $7 a pack. 
 "The numbers are clear," Mr. Bloomberg said. "You raise cigarette taxes, the kids smoke less."

THE BUZZ -- "I doubt it," said Adam, 18, disputing the mayor's theory as he stood behind a bagel store on 88th Street. "If kids can afford $5 a pack, another couple of bucks won't make much of a difference. Instead of spending a dollar on soda, I'll spend it on cigarettes."
At the same corner, Tanya, 16, was polishing off a Marlboro Light. "I only go through a pack a week," she said. "So $2 is not going to make a huge hole. It's just annoying."
Others stood on principle. "If people are going to smoke, don't try to tell people what to do by jacking up the price," said John, 18, who calls himself a social smoker. Alexandra, 17, who is partial to Marlboro Ultra Lights, added: "This is not about stopping smoking. It's about getting money." 
None of the smokers interviewed would divulge their full names, in contrast to their nonsmoking peers. "I think smoking is disgusting, and you can print that," said Sean Glass, 17. "Anything to make people stop is good. If I smoked, I would be against it. But I think it's disgusting."
The Dalton students were quick to note their relative wealth, and suggested that a steeper cigarette tax would discourage their less fortunate peers. "I imagine it's a fairly regressive tax," said Reid Capalino, 17. "I'd be interested to know, aren't the majority of people who smoke low-income?"
Several seniors guessed that one-third of their classmates enjoyed the occasional puff, and were skeptical that a few dollars, here and there, would alter a habit so ingrained in certain social circles. "Drugs are expensive, and people do that," said Dana Weissman, 17.
But Erica, 16, who started smoking nine months ago, was already forming an economic game plan if the tax were approved. "I think we'll start sharing cabs," she said. DENNY LEE

Optimism Returns For Airline Stocks

BYLINE:  By JOANNE LEGOMSKY 

 BODY:
MANY airline analysts are peering past the terrorist attacks and the weak economy to better times for the industry. The premise is that it is better to be six months early with these stocks than one month late.
 "We definitely expect a significant rally for most airline stocks," said Susan M. Donofrio, an analyst at Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown. 
 JetBlue Airways, a budget start-up, disclosed plans this month for an initial stock sale, reflecting the renewed industry confidence. The announcement, originally planned for Sept. 11, also pointed up the relatively sunny operating climate for low-cost, low-fare airlines compared with industry giants like American Airlines, a part of AMR; United Airlines, owned by UAL; and Delta Air Lines. 
Buying airline stocks can require a strong stomach. Many carriers are still reeling from the economic slowdown and Sept. 11.
Industry load factors -- the percentage of seats occupied by paying customers -- fell by 11 percentage points in mid-September, forcing the large airlines to mark down fares and cut capacity 15 to 20 percent.
In the quarter ended Dec. 31, the major airlines, which have large networks and connect passengers through hub airports, reported losses totaling $2.8 billion.
So far, more nimble low-fare airlines that fly direct routes, like Southwest Airlines, JetBlue and AirTran, have remained profitable.
For most airlines, load factors have largely recovered to pre-attack levels. In January, load factors for the overall industry actually edged above year-earlier levels.
"Recession is not necessarily bad for all airlines," said Michael J. Linenberg, an analyst at Merrill Lynch. Low-cost carriers can gain profitable market share as the major airlines cut capacity, he said.
There are two schools of thought about which airlines to buy. One favors the no-frills variety while the other finds more potential -- with more risk -- in the major, established lines.
"The Wal-Marts of the airline industry do well in a downturn," said Mr. Linenberg, who continues to recommend Southwest because of its cost advantages. Its shares have climbed 58 percent since Sept. 17, to $20.58. He said the shares could reach $25 within a year.
Jamie Baker, an analyst at UBS Warburg, also expects the low-fare airlines to retain their edge. "Given the uncertainty and time delays of the airport experience, I expect leisure demand to recover more quickly than business demand," he said. "So airlines that cater to the price-conscious traveler should see a quicker return to pre-attack levels."
Mr. Baker is bullish on AirTran, which he thinks will benefit from sharp capacity reductions by competitors in its Northeast markets. It now trades at $6.31; his 12-month price target is $8.50. 
Because of its enormous fixed costs, the industry is highly leveraged and prone to huge profit swings. Since commercial aviation was deregulated in 1978, some 137 airlines have filed for bankruptcy.
Investors who think an economic recovery is imminent may be attracted to the major airlines, whose fortunes are more cyclical. 
For example, Brian D. Harris, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, said he expects demand for air travel to recover fully by year-end. He is bullish on the larger airlines. "There are some very appealing valuations among big, ugly cyclical majors, trading below their Sept. 10 levels," he said.
Continental Airlines, he said, has the best growth prospects. But he considers its shares, like those of the other cyclically sensitive carriers, to be very risky. His 12-month price target for the stock is $42; it now trades at $30.90.
Mr. Harris downgraded Southwest in January to neutral from buy, citing its valuation. Southwest's market value exceeds that of all other domestic carriers combined.
Resolution of security and insurance issues after the passage of the airport security act is crucial, said Ms. Donofrio of Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown. "Travelers should begin to notice tighter and more consistent security checks," she said.
Higher insurance and security costs hurt the low-cost carriers disproportionately. "Their lean cost structures makes make it harder for them to absorb the higher costs," she said. Her top pick is Delta, which she said could rise to $61 in 12 to 18 months, from $32.77 on Friday.
LINDA R. KILLIAN, manager of the IPO Plus fund of Renaissance Capital, likes the two-year-old JetBlue, based in New York. "It's very efficient but with some nice touches, like satellite television and leather seats," she said.
Steven R. Hendrickson, president and co-founder of the Kiehl Hendrickson Group, an aviation consulting firm in Minneapolis, said that the smaller airlines might be more vulnerable to price wars, but that JetBlue had special advantages. "They are remarkably well capitalized for a start-up," he said. "So it's less likely that another carrier would initiate a war of attrition."
Clifford M. Winston, an economist at the Brookings Institution, expressed doubts about the big airlines. "If things come back, they'll do better," he said. "But if the economy just limps along, it will be survival of the fittest."
What if another shock devastates demand? "At least airlines can adjust prices and routes," he said. "Thank goodness the industry's deregulated."

HEADLINE: White House Memo; 
Cheney Takes to the Open Road And Basks in a Warmer Spotlight

BYLINE:  By ERIC SCHMITT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 23 

 BODY:
Vice President Dick Cheney has suffered a hail of criticism for refusing to release records of meetings his energy task force held with executives from the Enron Corporation and other companies. This week, Mr. Cheney found a way to change the subject: skip town.
 Hopscotching through California to a string of events and political fund-raisers, the vice president was in the public eye for the most extended time since the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11. Freed from his "secure, undisclosed locations," Mr. Cheney hit the road in a carefully scripted four-day trip. The vice president says the trip had nothing to do with Enron. But it did enable him to shed his big-oil image for a while and play to his strengths before cheering audiences. 
 Mr. Cheney, a former secretary of defense, talked tough on Iraq to marines in San Diego. He promised help for farmers and ranchers in the San Joaquin Valley. He promoted Mr. Bush's vision of a new economy to business leaders in Silicon Valley. He raised money for two grateful House Republicans. He also joked with Jay Leno on "The Tonight Show." On Sunday, Mr. Cheney will close the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. 
"It's been a good trip," Mr. Cheney said in an interview aboard Air Force Two on Thursday, the last day of his California swing before heading to his home in Jackson, Wyo., for the weekend. "California is a very important state. They've got a major role to play in terms of the economy."
For a White House that hates for Mr. Cheney to overshadow Mr. Bush in any way, the vice president's Western tour was the ideal antidote to the Enron scandal -- at least until Friday, when the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, filed suit to require the administration to release the records of the task force meetings.
But even as those court proceedings drag out over the next several months, look for Mr. Cheney to spend more time on the road, balancing his duties as the vice president of a nation at war with partisan politicking in an election year in which control of the House and Senate are at stake.
"After months of focusing on national security, you're now seeing Cheney carving out a broader role for himself," said Vin Weber, a former Republican congressman and a close friend of the vice president. "He's attendant to the same concerns about his public persona as any other political leader."
Next month, Mr. Cheney will embark on a grueling 10-day, 12-nation trip to the Middle East and Europe to shore up support for the administration's war aims. Last week, he gave a major foreign policy speech at the Council on Foreign Relations.
On the domestic front, the vice president still plays a pivotal role as the bridge between the administration and Republicans on Capitol Hill. Before Election Day in November, Mr. Cheney is expected to make at least 60 campaign appearances, mostly for House candidates.
"It's something I enjoy doing," Mr. Cheney, a former Wyoming congressman, said of the traditional vice presidential job of stumping for candidates. "It's good for business, shall we say, in terms of a lot of what I have to do on the Hill. The members care a lot about it. They know you're out there lending a hand to maintain or build a majority that's running the bank politically."
For Mr. Cheney, this trip was an opportune time to test his new routine, spending what will be a total of 10 straight days outside Washington. He bracketed the California trip with quail hunting in Texas last weekend and a planned appearance presiding over the Wyoming Legislature on Monday. 
Mr. Bush was traveling in Asia, and he and Mr. Cheney never spoke directly during their trips. The separation was their longest since taking office. Congress was in recess.
The vice president's mission this week was to "flesh out" themes in Mr. Bush's State of the Union address, said Mary Matalin, Mr. Cheney's senior political adviser. Mr. Cheney defended Mr. Bush's choice of phrasing, "axis of evil," to describe Iran, Iraq and North Korea, and their efforts to pursue nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. He touted signs of economic recovery.
Mr. Cheney also got in some political digs, praising the Republican-controlled House for approving trade, economic stimulus and energy bills that the administration favors, while implicitly criticizing the Democratic-controlled Senate for failing to act on the legislation.
The vice president took question after question at his three fund-raisers, where guests paid $1,000 to $12,500 each to hear him. But he held only one news conference during the four-day trip. In the gathering with reporters in Fresno, dominated by agriculture issues, Mr. Cheney had to turn to Agriculture Secretary Ann M. Veneman to answer a question about raisins and almonds.
In San Jose, a few reporters were allowed to accompany the vice president as he toured the Tech Museum of Innovation and marveled at a robotic dog named Cosmo, which chased a plastic ball on command. But the journalists were not allowed to ask Mr. Cheney questions.
"We aren't the newsmakers," said Jennifer Millerwise, Mr. Cheney's press secretary. The idea, she and other aides to Mr. Cheney said, is to reinforce Mr. Bush's message and policies but not get out ahead of them.
Even Mr. Cheney's critics said that getting him out on the hustings was shrewd. 
"In fairness to them, he has other obligations," said Philip M. Schiliro, chief of staff for Representative Henry A. Waxman, a California Democrat who has led the call for release of the energy task force records. "But any time he can change the subject from Enron, he'll do so."
Mr. Cheney denied that he designed his trip to shift attention from the Enron scandal or the impending showdown with Congress. 
"I'd be doing it without any of the stuff with respect to Enron," Mr. Cheney said in the interview. "The idea that the president or vice president can't meet with somebody without telling Henry Waxman that you had the meeting, or who's in the meeting, or what was said in the meeting, I just find an outrageous thought."
In a recent Newsweek poll, 60 percent of Americans said Mr. Cheney should release the information to the accounting office. But when Mr. Leno brought up the subject on Tuesday, Mr. Cheney drew wild applause from the studio audience with this response: "What we've seen over the past 30 years is a continual encroachment by Congress in the executive branch, a weakening of the presidency. The president and I are bound and determined not to allow that to happen on our watch."
Many Democrats remain convinced the issue will dog the vice president throughout the election season. 
"Cheney will be an albatross for the party as Enron unfolds," said Bob Mulholland, a campaign adviser for the California Democratic Party.
For his part, Mr. Cheney said he welcomed a court fight to settle such an important issue. "It ought to be resolved in a court, unless you're willing to compromise on a basic fundamental principle, which we are not," he said.

HEADLINE: Some Taxi Drivers Say a Fare Increase Would Be Bad for Business 

BYLINE:  By JAYSON BLAIR 

 BODY:
For New York taxi drivers, the decline in tourism after the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center was bad for business, and many have quit to take other jobs.
 So one would think that a fare increase, which Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg proposed last week, would be warmly welcomed by the cabbies trying to ride out the economic slump. 
 But it was not.
In interviews across Manhattan yesterday, drivers of yellow taxis said that Mayor Bloomberg's plan was flawed because it failed to take into account the economics of a business that many New Yorkers benefit from, but few understand. 
"From my experience, I'll tell you in one sentence: the money will go to the owners," said Santa Jesus, 51, a Dominican immigrant who has been driving a yellow cab for almost 30 years. Like most cabbies, he drives a car that is owned by one of the 15 major companies that operate in the city. 
Some drivers think that a fare increase would actually make matters worse. Taliby Diakite, 47, a Liberian immigrant who has been a yellow cabby for 13 years, said, "I get scared that we will start to lose passengers if rates go up, and not gain a cent."
Mr. Jesus and other cabbies credit Mr. Bloomberg with not being so naive as to believe that a straight fare increase would be passed on to drivers. But they say they doubt that he will be able to persuade cab companies to refrain from turning around and raising the daily rental fees that drivers pay, as they have done in the past.
Members of several cab owner associations could not be reached for comment yesterday.
The Taxi and Limousine Commission, which is considering a 12 percent to 17 percent fare increase, last approved one in January 1996. The price for the first one-fifth of a mile went to $2 from $1.50, and each additional one-fifth of a mile to 30 cents, up from 25 cents. The night charge of 50 cents and the rate of 20 cents a minute charged while a cab is idling in traffic went unchanged. 
After that increase, most cab companies raised their rental fees within two to three weeks by an average of 20 percent, drivers said. Many drivers pay up to $110 a day for their cars and $25 for gas, and also cover the cost of traffic tickets, insurance and other licenses.
But since then, fares for the city's 12,187 yellow cabs have not gone up, despite higher gasoline prices and strict new regulations pushed through by the Giuliani administration that quadrupled insurance requirements, increased traffic fines for cabbies and made it much easier for them to lose their licenses.
The drop in business after Sept. 11 is just the latest blow in an industry with few cushions for hard times, and when the cabbies suffer, so do the businesses that cater to them. At a popular gathering spot, the Gaseteria on 11th Avenue and West 54th Street, cabbies get their fill: gas for the car and food from Pete's Coffee Trailer, a white truck parked nearby. It is also one of the few places with a public restroom drivers can use. They do not seem to mind that there is no door on the restroom and that they are protected from the cold and from public view only by a metal sign that reads, "New 93 Octane."
The man who sells sandwiches from the truck says he is selling fewer $3.30 tuna-and-cheese wraps and fewer 50-cent cups of coffee. The gas station owner complains that the pumps are not being used as much. 
Across town, in front of the Citigroup Building at Lexington Avenue and 53rd Street, sits Samuel O. Pekoh, a Ghanaian immigrant who drove a company cab for years before buying his own medallion and a $41,000 Ford Explorer. There is not a single dent on the vehicle, now eight months old. He has a video camera, a wireless modem and a credit card machine inside.
But Mr. Pekoh knows that his is a rare success story. Mr. Pekoh, who studied civil engineering in college, said it was not easy for cabbies to start a business for themselves. 
A medallion can run up to $195,000 (down from $250,000 since Sept. 11, when officials estimate that more than 2,000 drivers left the business). Then there are insurance and loan payments, accident costs, annual city license fees, gas prices and ticket fines. 
Without a way to guarantee that the money would end up in the hands of the drivers, Mr. Pekoh said, a fare increase would enrich only the cab companies.
"The companies financed Giuliani, and they were together," Mr. Pekoh said. "I would hope that Bloomberg would talk to real taxicab drivers."

HEADLINE: Notes from Tuscaloosa; 
Alabamians Go by an Outdated Book

BYLINE:  By Diane Roberts; Diane Roberts is an English professor at the University of Alabama.

DATELINE: TUSCALOOSA, Ala. 

 BODY:
It's the second year of the 21st century, and Alabama is still fighting its old battles with prejudice and poverty, still trying to combat the image that it's a state where the only well funded education program is college football. Alabamians are not unnaturally backward in their social attitudes: they want tolerance, good schooling and good jobs.
 What holds Alabama back is its own Constitution, at least according to the growing number of people who want to reform it. Ratified in 1901, the Alabama Constitution has 706 amendments -- so far. It is 315,000 words long, nearly 40 times the length of the United States Constitution. Thicker than the phone books of most Alabama cities, it enshrines an inequitable tax structure, a pauperized education system, racism, and centralization of power in the hands of special interests. 
 There have been periodic attempts to overhaul this document, and all have failed. But this year the issue has taken on new urgency, with even some conservatives supporting constitutional revision. The Alabama Baptist Convention, for example, is pro-reform, though the Christian Coalition is not. Most of the state's newspapers, as well as Gov. Don Siegelman, a moderate Democrat running for re-election, endorse revision. So do two of Governor Siegelman's Republican opponents, Representative Bob Riley and Lt. Gov. Steve Windom.
Tim James, another Republican and the son of former governor Fob James, however, accuses reformers of a "dark agenda" dedicated to raising taxes. The Association for Judeo-Christian Values, a small but vocal group, concurs. The association plans to sue the state to stop revision because any changes will inevitably "bring new taxes in and throw God out."
God and taxes -- and race -- were much on the minds of the 1901 Constitution's authors. Cotton plantation masters and industrialists, known as "Big Mules," saw to it that their tax burden remained light while the Bourbon-class lawmakers made it their mission to reassert white supremacy in Alabama and restore what they saw as divine order. Alabama's 1875 Constitution had made it possible for black men to vote. To the resurgent white gentry, this was intolerable. By instituting an expensive poll tax, as well as allowing local registrars to decide whether an applicant was of "good character," the 1901 Constitution robbed 98 percent of blacks and at least 40,000 poor whites of their right to participate in democracy.
The Voting Rights Act of 1965 eventually trumped Jim Crow. A provision banning interracial marriage, long ago rendered void by the United States Supreme Court, was finally voted out of the Constitution in 2000. But many see the real racism of the 1901 Constitution in a regressive tax regime that disproportionately hits the poor hardest.
For years, politicians have courted New South businesses, but a plantation-friendly tax system still shackles the state to the Old South. Under the Constitution, a family of four earning as little as $4,600 must pay income tax, in addition to paying sales tax on necessities like food.
The Constitution is far kinder to the rich. Alabama allows a full deduction for federal income taxes, which only middle- to upper-income people pay. The Constitution also hands landowners substantial tax breaks: if they claim that something is being grown for sale on the property -- even, say, a few bales' worth of hay on urban land owned by a mall developer -- the landowner pays a risibly low rate for property tax. Timber land is taxed at as little as 95 cents an acre.
If that isn't bad enough, local governments have no power to levy local property taxes to take care of community needs. The 1901 Constitution prevents home rule, so counties have to beg the State Legislature for action on everything from zoning to bingo games. Alabama's schools and universities have been deprived for a century, financed by volatile revenues from sales and state income taxes. The state now ranks 46th in the nation for supporting public education. Even a slight downturn in the economy means teacher layoffs, overcrowded classrooms and no money for repairs or textbooks. 
This is the Alabama the 1901 Constitution has made. More than 60 percent of Alabamians now want reform, recent newspaper polls say. But what sort of reform will depend on the framing of the argument.
The antireformers are using rising taxes as a scare tactic. God has become a useful tool for that camp, too. Roy Moore, chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, for example, has praised the 1901 Constitution for keeping taxes down. He's also personally interested in keeping God in the public arena. Late one night last summer, Justice Moore had a couple of workmen cart a 2 1/2-ton boulder inscribed with the Ten Commandments into the Supreme Court building in Montgomery. Meanwhile, his wife, Kayla Moore, an antireform activist, has said that "man is inherently evil" and that the Constitution restrains evil.
Some legislators have promised to keep God in the Constitution if they can simply rewrite the document amendment by amendment -- an exercise that could take years. Governor Siegelman says he favors a constitutional convention where the people can craft a new governing document for the new Alabama. Most Alabamians are tired of being tied to an unlovely, unjust past, but an election year is a tough time to talk about real change in a state where a word like "tax" has somehow become equated with sin.

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY; 
Technology's Toxic Trash Is Sent to Poor Nations

BYLINE:  By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 24 

 BODY:
The global export of electronics waste, including consumer devices, computer monitors and circuit boards, is creating environmental and health problems in the third world, a report to be issued on Monday by five environmental organizations says.
 The report says that 50 to 80 percent of electronics waste collected for recycling in the United States is placed on container ships and sent to China, India, Pakistan or other developing countries, where it is reused or recycled under largely unregulated conditions, often with toxic results. 
 The groups said there were no precise estimates of the amount of such waste currently created by the disposal of obsolete consumer electronic and computing gear. The Environmental Protection Agency estimated last year, however, that in 1997 as many as 3.2 million tons of "e-waste" ended up in United States landfills and that the amount might increase fourfold in several years. 
The groups also cited National Safety Council estimates that as many as 315 million computers have or will become obsolete from 1997 to 2004, generating a wide range of potentially toxic wastes.
For example, each color computer monitor or television display contains an average of four to eight pounds of lead, which can enter the environment when the monitors are illegally disposed of in landfills.
"We've created a problem that has to be dealt with," said Ted Smith, executive director of the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition, one of the groups that participated in the report. The others are the Basel Action Network, Toxics Link India, Pakistan's Society for the Conservation and Protection of the Environment and Greenpeace China.
An E.P.A. scientist, Robert Tonetti, acknowledged that a significant portion of the nation's obsolete consumer electronics gear was exported. He said, however, that there was no systematic reporting of the shipments, so there was no way to gauge the extent of the problem accurately. "No one has a good grasp of the numbers," said Mr. Tonetti, a senior environmental scientist in the E.P.A.'s office of solid waste.
Mr. Tonetti said that figures in a 1999 National Safety Council report showed that about 723,000 computer monitors had been recycled in the United States and 100,000 had been exported. The report noted that more than a million monitors were unaccounted for and that many of them may have gone to parts brokers who subsequently exported the gear.
There is an international debate over how to deal with the problem, Mr. Tonetti said, adding that the European Union was moving toward requiring manufacturers to take cradle-to-grave responsibility for their products, particularly when they contain potentially hazardous materials. In contrast, the United States industry has resisted this approach, he said.
While there is no consensus on a solution, he said the environmental groups had focused on important issues that should have more attention. Mr. Tonetti added, however, that the cradle-to-grave approach was not endorsed by the United States government. Environmental groups, he said, have overlooked that much electronics manufacturing is now outside of the United States and Europe, complicating the issue of manufacturer responsibility.
He also said that a significant factor in the increased export of obsolete electronics from the United States was the closing of smelters here in recent years, frequently because of environmental regulations.
The report, "Exporting Harm: The Techno-Trashing of Asia," focuses on electronics recycling around the region of Guiyu in Guangdong province in China. The area, which is northeast of Hong Kong, includes a cluster of small villages that since 1995 have become a booming recycling center for electronic gear arriving from all over the globe through the port of Nanhai.
The region has a work force of approximately 100,000 people focused on recycling, the report stated, with the process broken into small, specialized cottage work groups. In one neighborhood, plastics may be salvaged, while in another, circuit boards may be smelted to extract trace amounts of gold and other valuable materials, according to the investigators, who visited the region in December last year. 
One casualty of the recycling boom in the region has been drinking water, the report says. Since 1995, as a result of groundwater pollution, water has been trucked in from 20 miles away.
The investigators said the recycling operations often involved young children, many of whom were unaware of the hazards. The hazardous operations included open burning of plastics and wires, riverbank acid works to extract gold, the melting and burning of soldered circuit boards and the cracking and dumping of cathode ray tubes laden with lead. 
The report described certain areas of Guiyu that were dedicated to dismantling printers. In those areas, toner cartridges were recycled manually, according to Jim Puckett, an author of the report. 
"Workers without any protective respiratory equipment or special clothing of any kind opened cartridges with screwdrivers and then used paint brushes and their hands to wipe the toner into a bucket," the report said. It added that the process created constant clouds of toner, which were routinely inhaled.
Mr. Puckett, coordinator of the Basel Action Network, said, "They call this recycling, but it's really dumping by another name." The network is an international watchdog group that is trying to enforce the Basel Convention, a 1989 United Nations treaty intended to limit the export of hazardous waste. The United States is the only developed nation that has not signed it. 
The convention calls on countries to reduce exports of hazardous wastes to a minimum and deal with their waste problems within their own borders where possible.
The authors of the report argue that stricter environmental regulations in the developed world have caused a trend toward exporting hazardous materials to the poorest countries, where occupational and environmental protections are inadequate.
The environmental groups took water and soil samples along the Lianjiang River and had them tested by a private center in Hong Kong. The results, the groups said, revealed alarming levels of heavy metals that corresponded directly with metals most commonly found in computers. The water sample, taken near a site where circuit boards were processed and burned, showed levels of toxic materials 190 times the levels for drinking water recommended by the World Health Organization.
The report also notes evidence of similar unregulated recycling operations in both Pakistan and India. The researchers said that Karachi, Pakistan, was one of the country's principal markets for second-hand and scrap materials.

HEADLINE: From Notes to Flowcharts 

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN KINZER 

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS, Feb. 20 

 BODY:
During the 1980's the St. Louis Symphony rose from the heartland to become one of the most acclaimed orchestras in the United States. It toured and recorded widely, delighting both critics and audiences with its fine musicianship and creative musical direction.
 But about two years ago, with a suddenness that took even the orchestra itself by surprise, it plunged into a severe financial crisis caused largely by its ingrained habit of spending beyond its means. It faced the prospect of making devastating budget cuts in order to survive. 
 In recent months the orchestra, which was led for 24 years by Leonard Slatkin, one of the most admired American conductors, has been pulled back from the brink. A new management team has won extraordinary cooperation from musicians and is planning an ambitious fund-raising campaign. 
Many American orchestras are known for tough and sometimes bitter adversarial relations between players and management. If that was once the case in St. Louis, it is no longer. Faced with looming disaster, both sides have joined forces in a way that could prove a model for other orchestras.
Last month the two sides signed a new contract that includes a pay cut of about 8 percent for musicians, far less than was originally proposed. The contract also gives musicians a substantially greater role in planning the orchestra's future. Two musicians now sit on the 49-member board, and they are given access to most of the orchestra's financial records. Major decisions are made only after extensive consultation.
"This is not a well-worn path," said Timothy Myers, a trombone player. "We're figuring things out as we go along. But I'm optimistic because we're addressing the key issue, which is: What is the role of the musician? 
"We've already decided it's not merely to show up and play the notes on the page. But what is it? We're not fund-raisers, we don't plan the musical program, but we can contribute in those areas and in many others. I wasn't trained to do anything more than play the instrument, but that's not enough anymore."
The St. Louis Symphony reached its pinnacle of achievement largely by spending money, both to attract top players and to stage elaborate and expensive productions in its hometown and on tour. Although end-of-season deficits became routine, no one worried much because a handful of donors could always be found to contribute the missing cash.
But as the deficits began to grow, reaching a peak of $10.3 million in 2000, donors became reluctant. At the same time the orchestra was losing money on a variety of projects ranging from a conservatory that it took over in 1994 to summer pops concerts. Voters resoundingly defeated the orchestra's effort to join a group of local cultural institutions that receive annual subsidies from a property tax surcharge. An effort to start a homegrown recording label also failed.
Worst of all, the orchestra made little effort to increase its endowment, which now stands at $18 million. By the standards of orchestras to which some have compared it in quality, like those in Chicago, Cleveland, Philadelphia, New York and Boston, it should have at least $100 million.
Business leaders in St. Louis finally lost patience with the orchestra, concluding that it was not managing itself well enough to deserve further support. Last March a former banker, W. Randolph Adams, was hired as a consultant, and five months later he joined the orchestra as its president and executive director.
"It was clear right away that we had to move from arguing over how to cut up the pie to how to keep the boat from sinking," Mr. Adams said. "We all had to start bailing."
Soon after reviewing the orchestra's books, Mr. Adams proposed a number of radical budget cuts including a 30 percent reduction in musicians' pay. He also raised the possibility of reducing the size of the orchestra from its current complement of 92 musicians. Those steps would almost certainly have led to a palpable decline in the orchestra's quality.
"There was a lot of shock and anger and denial," said Jan Gippo, a piccolo player who is a leader of the musicians' union. "We hadn't seen those kinds of figures before. We came up with demands, and management's response was: 'Here are the books. What do you want us to do?' No one had ever talked to us like that before. So we decided to start learning about flowcharts and business plans.
"We could have just stood our ground and gone on strike, but instead we've worked our way into a new context. There's much more of a partnership, an idea of working together for the institution. It's put us on the leading edge. There's no other major orchestra that has this level of interaction with management at all levels, from the concertmaster down to someone in the back row who has an idea and puts it on the agenda."
Among its cost-cutting steps, the orchestra has turned its conservatory over to Webster University, canceled its summer pops concerts and cut its season from 52 to 42 weeks per year. These and other reductions, together with the willingness of musicians to make concessions, persuaded business leaders and other large donors to begin writing checks again.
The largest came from the Taylor family, which owns Enterprise Rent-a-Car. It donated $40 million, $5 million for operating expenses and the rest to help build the endowment. The donation was contingent on the orchestra raising an equal sum to match it, and so far $16 million has been raised toward that goal. In the last six months an additional $29 million has been raised for a separate fund that will be used mainly to pay off past operating deficits.
Two donors gave $1 million each toward maintaining musicians' salaries, which was one reason why their pay cut in the new contract could be held to 8 percent.
As the financial picture began improving, however, the orchestra faced new uncertainty on the podium. Its music director, Hans Vonk, who replaced Mr. Slatkin in 1996, has Guillain-Barre syndrome, a central-nervous-system disorder. He fell ill this month and was unable to lead the orchestra at concerts in New York and Los Angeles.
Mr. Vonk is expected to return to his post, and orchestra analysts say his illness should not affect the symphony's recovery.
"They're going to make it," said Fred Zenone, president of the Symphony Orchestra Institute in Deerfield, Ill., which monitors orchestras across the country. "The musicians made some major concessions because they recognized that they've got something quite valuable. If they hadn't gotten this situation resolved, many of them would have left, and those are people you can't replace by just holding auditions. 
"It's a permanent roster of people who know each other and have developed together. They have an identity, and it's really nice to know that the music world isn't going to lose that identity."
Everyone at the St. Louis Symphony seems to agree that the key to its long-term stability is a large endowment. A major fund-raising campaign aimed at building one is to be started soon. It will include a concerted effort to raise money from small donors, something the orchestra has not done before.
"This has become a community issue," said David Halen, the concertmaster. "We've gone on radio talk shows, played at fund-raisers and done everything else we could think of. It was a call to action. I think that call is in the process of being answered, but we're just at the beginning. The kind of figures that are needed to resolve the problem are daunting. Matching the $40 million gift is not enough. We need a $150 million endowment."
The orchestra's board chairwoman, Virginia V. Weldon, said that was not as far-fetched a goal as it seemed even a few months ago.
"We had a lot of credibility to win back, especially in the business community, but people who said it couldn't be done are starting to become believers," Ms. Weldon said. "We're telling them that this orchestra is one of the main civic assets of this community. Do we want to lose one of the few things other than sports teams that people across the country and beyond will recognize?
"It's like climbing Mount Everest. We've just reached the base camp. That was a long hike, and there's still quite a distance to the summit. We need oxygen. But we will get there. We're absolutely committed to it."

HEADLINE: Patents; 
To some, globalization, not corporate lobbying, is the real reason copyrights are growing in power.

BYLINE:  By Sabra Chartrand 

 BODY:
THE battle over how long a copyright should last is often portrayed as a fight between Mickey Mouse's bosses and those who want to set him free to live where they believe he rightly belongs: in the public domain.
 As such, the sides in the battle are often starkly drawn. There are the giant music, movie and publishing companies, who support the 1998 Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act because it gives copyright holders an extra 20 years to exploit lucrative songs, stories and brand-name material. Then there are the scholars and supporters of the arts, who oppose the law, saying it is a fetter to inspiration and expression that prevents the public from freely accessing creative works. 
 For several years the sides have waged war in the courts, and last week the Supreme Court announced it would consider the question. In a battle pitting Property against Creativity, the court will focus on the more narrow question of whether the copyright extension law violates the Constitution.
There is an additional element of this dispute, however, often overlooked: namely, that the conflict is an outgrowth of the rapid transformation of United States intellectual property law that has taken place the last decade. Similarly intense, prolonged arguments erupted in the mid-1990's when the government moved to change the life span of patents and for the first time published patent applications 18 months after they were filed.
Both changes were made to bring United States laws in line with those in Europe and Japan. They were greeted with predictions of doom for American innovation, called violations of public rights and decried as the end of the tried-and-true patent system. Yet in spite of the heartfelt concern, once the new laws were in place, inventors adjusted.
So, although major corporations like the Walt Disney Company lobbied for the act, Mickey Mouse is not the only reason that Congress approved the law. 
"It's not just an arbitrary extension, but one designed to harmonize U.S. law with European law, as has been done in many other areas of intellectual property law," explained David Opderbeck, an intellectual property lawyer with McCarter & English, a Newark firm.
"That's a good justification for the extension," he added. "With the Internet, and technology and creativity becoming so global, some argument makes sense that those rules be as uniform as they can across borders."
Much of the creativity that crosses borders now does so in what Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of America and an outspoken proponent of the copyright extension, calls the "the copyright industries" -- movies, home video and DVD's, TV programs, music, books and computer software. And he can quickly rattle off their immense value
"They contribute 5 percent of the gross domestic product in this country," Mr. Valenti said. "They create new jobs at three times the rate of the rest of the economy. They bring in more revenue than the automobile, agricultural and aircraft industries. The movie industry alone has a surplus balance of trade with every country in the world. No other industry can make that statement."
He believes some of that revenue and those jobs were threatened before the 1998 copyright extension law. The original copyright law of 1790 granted protection for 14 years. Over the years, that term gradually increased until, just before the Bono Act, a work of art copyrighted after 1978 was protected for "life plus 50," that is, the lifetime of the artist plus 50 years. Works copyrighted before 1978, or by corporations, won copyrights for 75 years. The 1998 law added 20 years to those terms.
"The reason for this extension was the fact that the European Union had different rules and we wanted to match them," Mr. Valenti said. "If we're dealing with the E.U. and our material goes into the public domain 20 years before theirs does, the Europeans can use our product over there and Americans get not one dime back."
"My counterargument is, what difference does 75 or 95 years make?" he added. "What is the consumer benefit of 75 years?"
Many artists and their heirs might also wonder how it serves the public interest to allow free access to a cartoon mouse in red shorts and white gloves. For them, the argument for extended copyrights is simple, and emotional. Why shouldn't the owner of a hit song or a best-selling book be able to bequeath that property to his children, just as he would the family farm, heirloom jewelry or a successful business?
"Maybe Mickey Mouse isn't necessarily the best example," said Mr. Opderbeck. "There's not a lot of cultural significance there, unless you ask my 3-year-old son."
"It's a little overstated to say the public has a right to intellectual property," he continued. But getting a patent or a copyright means entering into a bargain with the government, he said. "The deal is that you have to give it back at some point so it goes into the public domain, and the public can make use of it and improve upon it."
Extending a copyright simply awards a longer monopoly on something already created. And Mr. Opderbeck says that diminishes the power of copyrights to "promote the progress of science and useful arts," as is stated in the Constitution.
"If you've already created it, then there's no more incentive," he said. "You already got your side of the bargain."
It is hard to answer arguments raised by those who say copyrights stifle expression and creativity, and place undue burden on teachers, researchers and academics. But Mr. Valenti is willing to try. 
"Copyrights only stifle if you're going to copy something," he said. "The movie 'Gladiator' is a progeny of 'Spartacus.' 'Gladiator' is about a slave, just as 'Spartacus' is. But it didn't infringe on the 'Spartacus' copyright. There are only so many plots in literature. You just use them in different ways."
"I'm not saying the public domain is bad," Mr. Valenti said. "But how does it benefit the consumer? If a film is in the public domain, who takes care of it? Who refurbishes it if the print goes bad? What incentive does anyone have to keep the movie alive and vibrant?"
In the end, even if much of the argument arises from the emotional issues surrounding yet another major change to intellectual property law, it is now likely to be settled by the Supreme Court's interpretation of the act's constitutionality. And that will turn on whether Congress overstepped the instructions in the Constitution to award copyrights for a "limited period of time." Even Mr. Valenti does not advocate perpetual copyrights, but many advocates agree with him when he declares: "A limited period of time is whatever Congress says it is."

HEADLINE: Impatient Court Pres ses the F.C.C. to Deregulate 

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 24 

 BODY:
Last week's rebuke of the F.C.C. by the federal appeals court here was far from unusual -- and is unlikely to be the last.
 Consider another recent case, in which a different panel of the same court pelted a lawyer from the Federal Communications Commission with hostile questions as he tried to defend a significant rule limiting the expansion of media companies within a single metropolitan market. 
 Experts, including top commission officials, now expect that the regulation -- which generally bars a broadcaster from owning more than one station in a market unless there are at least eight other independently owned stations -- is doomed. The only question is whether in the next few weeks the court orders the agency to reconsider the regulation, known as the "eight-voices rule," or simply strikes it down.
That question is part of the broader trend. 
Over the last year, the commission has lost a vital string of cases before the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on issues ranging from telephone rates and wireless spectrum auctions to ownership limits in the cable and broadcasting industries.
The agency was handed its latest setback last week, when the appeals court struck down one rule that had limited a cable company from owning a broadcaster in the same city, and ordered the commission to reconsider a second rule that prohibits a television network from owning stations that broadcast to more than 35 percent of the nation's homes.
Impatient with the slow pace of deregulation and unfilled promises of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the court has repeatedly shown disdain for the justifications for decades-old rules that had been offered by the appointees of the Clinton administration.
The court's impatience flashed in last week's opinion, when the judges noted that the telecommunications act's mandate "might better be likened to Farragut's order at the battle of Mobile Bay ('Damn the torpedoes! Full speed ahead.') than to the wait-and-see attitude of the commission."
Many regulations like those at issue in last week's decision have been vulnerable because, as a political compromise struck during the drafting of the 1996 act, Congress instructed the commission to justify many of its rules every two years. The biennial review has proved to be problematic for the commission, which has often tried to implement otherwise laudable goals such as promoting diversity of voices on the airwaves, or limiting the economic influence of cable companies by using what appear to be arbitrary numbers and standards.
As a result, the philosophically and politically diverse court has reached out with an unusual degree of unanimity to chip away at the regulations that have long restricted the nation's largest media conglomerates from expanding further.
"The F.C.C. has been getting very little deference," said Richard E. Wiley, a former chairman of the agency whose law firm, Wiley, Rein & Fielding, represents an array of broadcast and cable companies with issues before the courts and regulators. "This is a super-critical court. It is a court that is impatient that the F.C.C. has not properly justified its regulations."
Andrew Jay Schwartzman, president of the Media Access Project, a consumer group that advocates diversity of the airwaves and has tried to defend the commission's regulations, finds himself in a frustrating position.
"The commission is getting hammered in case after case, manifesting a deep skepticism and disdain for the F.C.C.'s decision-making process," he said.
Consumer groups, television affiliates and others on the losing end of the cases are preparing to once again ask Congress and the regulators to try to preserve the old rules. And they have some powerful allies in lawmakers like Senator Ernest F. Hollings, the South Carolina Democrat who heads the Commerce Committee. Repeatedly during the 1980's, Senator Hollings managed virtually single-handedly to preserve ownership rules like the one prohibiting a television station from owning a newspaper in the same city, simply by attaching riders to spending bills and other must-pass legislation.
"Since at least 1995, all we have heard is that the broadcast concentration cap will be repealed within six months," said Alan Frank, the chairman of the Network Affiliated Stations Alliance and the president of Post-Newsweek Stations, the unit of the Washington Post Company that owns six network-affiliated stations around the country. "I think the odds are still good that the cap will hold."
Still, many experts and lawmakers say that they believe that it will be harder than ever to retain many of the current rules in light of the actions by the court, the reticence of most of Congress, and the overall commitments of the Bush administration and top F.C.C. officials to deregulation.
"The stars are aligned for a variety of ownership limits to be relaxed, said Scott C. Cleland, chief executive of the Precursor Group, a research organization that studies regulatory and political trends in telecommunications.
While many of the policy changes being ordered by the court are consistent with the deregulatory views of Michael K. Powell, the commission's chairman, the decisions are a decidedly mixed blessing for his agency.
For years during the Clinton administration, Mr. Powell served as a Republican commissioner who often voted in dissent. He was openly skeptical of many of the same rules that his agency has more recently found itself unsuccessfully defending before the appeals court. In that sense, his admonitions have proven prophetic, and the court's own impatience with deregulation is more or less consistent with his own thinking.
But the court has also steadily undermined the F.C.C. as an institution, and the judges' disregard for the agency's decisions has raised new fears that it will embolden other companies to raise new legal challenges to a host of telecommunications rules. While he appears unsurprised by some of the court decisions, Mr. Powell finds himself troubled by some of their implications.
"It's a tough environment," he said last week. "The judges have raised barriers significantly, and are making it much tougher to justify some of the rules. They are skeptical of theoretical justifications for rules, without more empirical support and greater analytical rigor."
For Mr. Powell, who was appointed chairman last year, the appeals court's pronouncements are particularly poignant. He began his legal career as a clerk to Judge Harry T. Edwards, the former chief judge of the appeals court, who has been particularly critical of some of the commission's regulations and who remains an important mentor.
The appeals court has imposed a heavy legal burden on the commission to justify the regulations, leading some to conclude that it may, in the end, be legally impossible for the agency to adopt any standards. That too, has troubled officials like Mr. Powell, who -- though skeptical of some of the current restrictions -- does not support a completely unregulated market and is sympathetic to some of the goals of the old rules.
"If the presumption that some are hearing from these decisions is no rules, that's just not my philosophy," he said. "The goals of competition and diversity of media are very, very worthy. We need better, more sustainable approaches to those goals. Proponents of the current approach should not be afraid to delve deeper and see if their assumptions are valid and explore more rational and effective policy. What choice is there -- to keep pounding into the judicial wall with 30-year-old rules and rationales?"

CORRECTION-DATE: February 28, 2002

 CORRECTION:
A chart in Business Day on Monday about pressure an appeals court has put on the Federal Communications Commission to increase the number of television stations one company can own misstated the number already owned by the Sinclair Broadcast Group. It is 50, not 48. The chart also erroneously included Sinclair on a list of companies and top markets. Sinclair does not have stations in New York or Philadelphia.
A chart in Business Day on Feb. 25 listing the largest owners of television stations, with an article about pressures to change federal rules limiting companies' holdings, included two companies erroneously and omitted three others. The chart also misstated the number of stations owned by three of the companies. Here is the corrected chart.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: ASIAN ARENA; 
'Yankee Don't Go' Is Message In Philippines Antiterror Rally

BYLINE:  By RAYMOND BONNER 

DATELINE: ZAMBOANGA, the Philippines, Feb. 24 

 BODY:
The White House image makers, with all their expertise, money and sophisticated techniques, could not have choreographed a more emotive demonstration of support for America's war on terrorism than the ordinary citizens in this humble city put on today. 
 Under a hot morning sun, nearly 2,000 residents turned out -- grandmothers, students, government employees, the unemployed. They sang and prayed, waving Philippine and American flags and placards. It was the largest rally here in many years, residents said. 
 On a simple wooden platform a parade of men and women, representing the business community, women, youth, the urban poor and teachers, addressed the assembled in English and Chavacano, which is derived from Spanish. They all had the same message: We want peace, and thank you for coming, America. The sultan of Sulu and North Borneo quoted from the Bible and the Koran. "Christians and Muslims are neighbors, so we have to love one another," he said, to applause.
Philippine political analysts and diplomats in Manila say that the sentiments expressed here in support of the American military activity are overwhelming throughout the country, but have been lost in the vocal opposition of a small minority.
This port city of 600,000, at a southern point of the Philippine archipelago where the Spanish built a fort in 1635, has become the base for the American forces who are here ostensibly to train the Philippine Army in fighting terrorism. Some 160 American Special Forces soldiers are now on the island of Basilan, a quick helicopter ride across the water. The quarry is Abu Sayyaf, the organization whose kidnappings and bombings have terrorized this town for a decade. Under restrictions insisted upon by the Philippine government, the Americans cannot engage in combat and will only be here for six months.
"Americans should stay, forever," said Crispina Bayot Marquez, 72, wearing a straw hat and a white T-shirt showing the American flag. "They are like angels that have come from heaven, to save Filipinos." Her youngest son, Vincent, 34 and unemployed, stood in a gaggle nearby. He looked like a throwback to the anti-American protesters during the Vietnam War, with his scraggly beard and long black hair under a bandana as he waved a banner. Except the bandana was an American flag, and the flag at the end of his long bamboo was the stars and stripes.
The demonstrators gathered in a small square, flanked by a fast-food restaurant, a convenience store and karaoke bar that billed itself "the music brewery." Their message was aimed primarily at Manila, to the politicians and demonstrators there who have been vociferous critics of the American presence. "Shut Up, Manila," read a placard.
"We challenge those who say that we don't need the American soldiers to go to Basilan and fight the Abu Sayyaf themselves," shouted one speaker, Jose Mari "Bong" Bue, 38, the business editor of the Zamboanga Daily Times. "If they cannot or if they have no guts to take our challenge, then just shut up and give us the chance to live a normal life, which we feel we could get as an aftermath of this joint R.P.-U.S. military exercise."
The rally, organized by local civic groups and city hall, also had a message for the United States, beyond the thanks. "They should do more than train our soldiers," said Mr. Bue. "They should fight. We are tired of kidnappings. We are tired of the bombings."
After two hours, the rally was over. It ended with a long line of men and women on the platform, many in baseball caps, including one with the New York Yankees logo, leading the demonstrators in a song. 
With their arms in the air, swaying, the demonstrators sang "America the Beautiful." All the verses.

HEADLINE: At U.N., Debating Who Gets the Right to Debate Human Rights 

BYLINE:  By SERGE SCHMEMANN 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 21 

 BODY:
Ten months after the United States lost its seat on the United Nations Human Rights Commission, the panel's regional group of Western countries is wrestling with a formula under which such embarrassing surprises would not be repeated.
 The proposed arrangement would allot each Western state a fixed number of years on the commission over the next 20 years. Everyone agrees that the United States should have the most, and San Marino the least. But why should Italy have more than Canada? Must France have the same number as Britain? What about Portugal? 
 All those involved, save one, agree on one thing -- they are happy not to be saddled with the Solomonic task of creating the formula. The exception is Thorsteinn Ingolfsson, Iceland's ambassador, who has been assigned the job.
Mr. Ingolfsson was cautious in describing his task and the resistance he has encountered. "There is a proposal on the table, but obviously the different weight of member states plays an important role in this respect," he said. "I was asked to provide my good offices to try to arrange this."
Mr. Ingolfsson's task is to rotate 10 seats among 29 nations for 20 years, based on the size, merit and history of the countries.
To understand the problem, it is necessary to understand that almost all committee memberships at the United Nations are divided among geographic groupings. Each group decides who its representatives will be. But if the group fails to agree on a slate, its seats are thrown open to a vote.
That is what happened last May 3 at the Human Rights Commission. The group to which the United States belongs, "Western Europe and Others Group," failed to agree on its candidates, so the Economic and Social Council voted to give the three vacant seats for the group to France, Austria and Sweden. 
The United States, which had been on the commission from the time it was founded under American leadership in 1947 and which regarded its seat as a sinecure for which it did not have to campaign, came in a distant fourth. The vote was widely seen as a reflection of frustration at the time with the Bush administration's dismissive attitude toward international organizations and treaties.
But it was also an acknowledged embarrassment for the United Nations, especially when countries with appalling human rights records like Sierra Leone and Sudan won seats.
So the Western group -- which includes all of Western Europe, the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Israel -- decided to develop a long-term rotating system. 
Though the elections are not until May, the group is hoping to have its system in place by the time the commission next convenes on March 18. Four of the group's seats are up for grabs this year, and five countries other than the United States have already declared their candidacies.
An agreement is far from certain. Mr. Ingolfsson's first proposal was rejected, and his second has raised strong objections. 
Under the draft, the United States would sit on the commission for 18 of the next 20 years (one of which it is sitting out now), Britain and France for 17, Germany for 15, Italy for 14, and so on down to 2 years for small nations like Andorra, Liechtenstein, Malta, Monaco, San Marino and -- in an apparent tribute to Mr. Ingolfsson's diplomacy -- Iceland.
Predictably, the objections have come from those in between. Canada, for example, would have a seat for 11 years. That hurts, because Canada has been a member for 21 of the last 25 years, and human rights is a priority in its foreign policy. Canada has prepared more resolutions than any other state.
The Portuguese ambassador, Francisco Seixas da Costa, said his country had been a member for 11 of the last 20 years, but would be restricted to 5 years. "We are very effective at winning elections," he said, suggesting that he would be happy to contest a closed ballot.
Most of the critics did not complain about giving the United States 18 years, and the Americans seemed happy with the proposed rotation, because after this year it would miss only 2018.
That means that additional years for some countries would have to be taken from other nations with the most years, including Britain and France. One advantage, diplomats said, was that if a year were taken from one of those nations, that would mean a year would be taken from the other as well, since neither would accept a minute's less time than the other had.
For Mr. Ingolfsson, any further changes would probably mean another lengthy round of hearing what great champions of human rights all these countries were, and fighting to snip a year here or a year there.
"Many member states are seriously interested in accomplishing this," he said, adding, "I really don't know what will come of this."

HEADLINE: Do Vouchers Help Choice or Religion? 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "A Matter of Church and State" (editorial, Feb. 20):
 The current outcomes produced by the voucher system may violate the Establishment Clause. 
However, if quality of education is considered as important as constitutionality, then declaring vouchers unconstitutional is not the solution. 
 Supply and demand dictate that, if the voucher system is found constitutional, the consolidation of vouchers toward religious schools could dissipate. If declared legal, demand for vouchers should increase. It is highly unlikely that the existing religious schools could satisfy this demand. Therefore, competing private schools would spring up, which in turn would reduce the percentage of religious schools receiving the vouchers, increase the educational options available to children, and eliminate arguments that voucher systems are religiously biased.

HEADLINE: Trying to Wean America From Oil 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
A Feb. 18 editorial calls oil import requirements an "addiction," implying a distorted motivation. It says the United States, with 4 percent of world population, consumes 25 percent of world oil. 
Yet America represents 25 percent of global G.D.P. 
 We import more than half our requirements. But dependency can be dealt with through supply diversity. For Mideast producers whose only important source of foreign revenue is oil, America is of vital importance. 
 The real issue is not dependency but vulnerability, or sudden unanticipated losses in supply. Yet we have a ready answer, the government's Strategic Petroleum Reserve. 
Your proposed move toward energy independence, a goal of the Carter administration, has been discarded as unachievable and not required. A sensible policy must reflect balance and diversity.

HEADLINE: Hinduism's Political Resurgence 

BYLINE:  By Pankaj Mishra; Pankaj Mishra is author of "The Romantics," a novel.

DATELINE: NEW DELHI 

 BODY:
A few weeks ago I was in Ayodhya, a North Indian pilgrimage town. In 1992 a crowd of Hindu men demolished a 16th-century mosque in Ayodhya. They claimed it had been built by the Mogul emperor Babur over the birthplace of Lord Rama. India changed fast after that moment of Hindu nationalist rage. The politicians who had led the crowd to the mosque that morning and later watched their followers erect Hindu idols over the rubble -- and who for most of the 50 years since independence had been on the political sidelines -- now hold top positions in the Indian government.
 Since the 1992 destruction, an enthusiasm for the free market has also overtaken India, but the new middle-class affluence hasn't reached Ayodhya. Down its monkey-infested alleyways, the richest people are still Hindu abbots. One whom I met in Ayodhya was Ramchandra Paramhans, who helped initiate, in 1950, the legal battle for the temple and who in the early 1980's entered into an opportunistic alliance with Hindu nationalist organizations then attempting to attract Hindu voters through an explicitly anti-Muslim program. 
 Mr. Paramhans described to me, as he fed cows in his vast straw-littered compound, how he had upbraided India's home minister, L. K. Advani, on the phone that morning for having neglected the temple issue. In his white dreadlocks and long beard, he seemed like a Hindu version of the self-important mullahs I had met in Pakistan. But senior bureaucrats really had traveled, a few weeks before, to his compound to mollify him after he threatened to bring down the government. And a few days after my visit to Ayodhya, Mr. Paramhans showed up in New Delhi at the head of a heavily publicized procession of abbots to deliver personally a blunt ultimatum to Prime Minister Behari Vajpayee.
I couldn't help but recall my meeting early last year with some prominent Islamic clerics and politicians at an old madrasa near Peshawar, Pakistan. The madrasa had become notorious after some of its alumni became the leaders of the Taliban. Its teachers were keen to impress upon me the apolitical nature of their work. I suspected they were dissembling, but I was more struck by their defensiveness. It was as though they could sense what has been confirmed since by the fundamentalists' failure to stir up trouble for Pervez Musharraf: that public opinion overwhelmingly opposes the fanatical ideologies that have undermined Pakistan in every way. It is this strong anti-extremist sentiment that General Musharraf now relies on -- much more than American support -- in his crackdown on militant groups and his more discreet confrontations with the ideologues given high places by the previous military ruler, Mohammad Zia ul-Haq.
While General Musharraf strives toward a secular polity, the ruling politicians of India head in the opposite direction. Hindu nationalists have long exalted Hindutva, or Hindu-ness, over the secular identities proposed for India by Gandhi and Nehru. So now the federal minister for education, Murli Manohar Joshi, promotes a new Indian history that highlights the depredations of Muslim invaders (as they are called) and celebrates Hindu bravery. Mr. Joshi has also allocated funds for such "Hindu sciences" as astrology. This sectarian-minded education is objected to by many of India's distinguished historians -- especially those who had stressed India's pluralist traditions in their now discarded textbooks. Mr. Joshi recently denounced these historians as "academic terrorists" who were more difficult to fight than the usual kind of terrorist.
This may be bluster; and perhaps India's largest-circulation news magazine, India Today, describes an isolated mood in a recent cover story on the "return of the militant Hindu." But that mood does exist. Fed by a patriotic media and film industry and reflected in bellicose posturing against Pakistan, it nearly dominates public life now; its urban middle-class constituency hopes that nationalism may provide a measure of security against the economic and political crises that, in the early 90's, had looked so threatening. And nationalist leaders continue to strengthen their hold over the heavily centralized Indian state as their constituents continue to gain from a globalized economy.
An antiterrorist ordinance -- introduced by the government before the recent attacks on the parliaments in Kashmir and Delhi -- would have required up to three years' imprisonment for a journalist who failed to assist government authorities. It has been challenged by human rights groups and political parties concerned about the possibility of its misuse against minorities. In any case, the ordinance is unlikely to curtail the activities of Hindu extremist outfits affiliated with the government like Shiv Sena, which claimed some credit for demolishing the Babri mosque in Ayodhya in December 1992 and was indicted by a judicial commission for inciting the pogrom against Muslims in Bombay in 1993.
What was once quickly identified as unreasonable and aberrant -- Hindu majoritarianism -- enjoys a growing influence and legitimacy as the ruling ideology of the Indian government. Oddly, the illiberal tendencies a military dictator seeks to expel, with popular support, from Pakistan seem to be finding a hospitable home in democratic India.

HEADLINE: Amid Riches, Angola's Poor Consider Their Future 

BYLINE:  By HENRI E. CAUVIN 

DATELINE: LUANDA, Angola, Feb. 24 

 BODY:
The residents of the hillside slum of Boa Vista wonder, now that the rebel leader Jonas Savimbi is dead, what is next for their country and what is next for them, the poor and weak in a nation ruled by wealth and war.
 A charming statesman and ruthless commander, Mr. Savimbi, who was 67, became the embodiment of a 27-year war that has made Angola one of the most desperate places in the world. It was an image he relished, and until he was killed on Friday by government commandos, it was an image his enemies were happy to burnish, the perfect bogeyman for the profound problems of this country. 
 With Mr. Savimbi gone, however, the hard questions that were being whispered are certain to come in shouts, from the tin-roof shacks of Boa Vista to the regal corridors of the White House, where President Jose Eduardo dos Santos is to meet with President Bush on Tuesday.
Rich in oil, diamonds and other natural resources, Angola is rife with disease, malnutrition and the violence of war. The World Food Program feeds about a million people. Life expectancy is 44 years. Almost one-third of the children die before the age of 5.
It is a bleak paradox, crystallized in the plight of Boa Vista, which sits on coveted bay-view property. Developers want to build luxury homes for the growing number of foreign oil industry executives, and before a public furor halted the razing of the neighborhood last year, thousands of people had been relocated to a barren tent camp 25 miles from the capital.
Left behind were thousands more who wonder when the bulldozers might be back. The death of Mr. Savimbi has given little comfort. 
"Now they have all the power," Joao Felizardo, 41, said tonight as he stood on a dark street, out of view of the soldiers sent to patrol the restive community. "They can run the country in a dictatorial way because the main enemy is gone. The government is free to do what it wants."
What eventually happens to the people of Boa Vista will be one small measure, among many, of the intentions of a government which, after years in the diplomatic wilderness, is feverishly seeking the legitimacy of the larger world, and in particular the International Monetary Fund.
With the death of Mr. Savimbi, the expectations of the international community are certain to increase, and so then will the pressure on President dos Santos. "The time has come," said a soldier who lives in Boa Vista. "Savimbi is dead, so what's the excuse? What else?"
For Angola, one of the poorest countries, the fund's seal of approval could offer a big payoff: a line of low-interest credit could allow the government to reschedule the $10 billion to $12 billion it already owes, laying the groundwork for rebuilding a country that has been gutted by nearly three decades of civil war.
But for a secretive government swarming with hives of corruption, the price would be high: a requirement that it open its books to scrutiny. Demands for data on national oil revenue and details of the country's murky debts have been ignored year after year by a government still cloaked in Soviet-era secrecy. 
The coming days will offer a hint of whether such attitudes are likely to change. An I.M.F. team from Washington spent several days in Luanda this month, officially on a routine annual visit but privately hopeful that the mission could lead the beginning of what even optimists predict would be a grinding march toward fiscal accountability.
A country of about 13 million people, Angola is sub-Saharan Africa's biggest oil producer after Nigeria, and has become an important source of oil for the United States. The ChevronTexaco Corporation is the biggest producer, and at the end of last year, TotalFinaElf of France began pumping a new field that is expected to push Angola's daily production over one million barrels. 
The companies have paid billions in signing bonuses and taxes, but the civil war has consumed much of the money, while most of the rest has apparently found its way into the offshore accounts of powerful people here and abroad.
Little has found its way to ordinary people.
This month, in a report to the United Nations Security Council, Kenzo Oshima, under secretary general for humanitarian affairs, gave a grim assessment of Angola: The number of people forced from their homes by war has doubled in two years, to more than four million. The World Food Program meets only a fraction of the need. 
Even before Mr. Savimbi was killed, critics in the capital were becoming more outspoken. Overseas, rights groups have focused attention on countries like Angola, Congo and Sudan, which are rich in natural resources yet desperately poor. "There is big pressure now," said Jose Cerqueira, an economist at the Catholic University of Angola who directs the Continents Development Initiative, a social development group. "The world is changing."
How well Angola is keeping up should become clear as the government considers the I.M.F. requests. At the top of the list is information about hundreds of millions of dollars in high-interest, oil-backed loans that Angola took out last year, despite the fund's strict limit on such borrowing. With its abysmal repayment record, Angola has come to rely on such high-priced loans to carry it through periodic cash crunches and allow the military campaign to continue.
For now, accounting for the debts would be a step in the right direction. 
"This has nothing to do with the legitimate right of the government to defend itself," said Simon Taylor, author of a 1999 report by Global Witness, a British nongovernmental organization, examining the role of oil money in corruption and war. "This has to do with how that process is being conducted." 
There are also questions about significant sums missing from the national treasury. In its latest report on Angola, the fund criticized the government for repeatedly making substantial off-budget expenditures and its failure to track state revenue.
In an interview this month with foreign journalists, the minister of petroleum, Jose Maria Botelho de Vasconcelos, declined to discuss the debts and said the I.M.F. had "no problem" with Angola's accounting.
Asked why ordinary Angolans, in a country so naturally rich, were still mired in poverty, Mr. Botelho de Vasconcelos said oil revenues had helped build schools and hospitals, and helped sustain the campaign against the rebels.
But Angolans are angry. 
Aida Manuel, 38, has eight children and was among the thousands of people forced out of Boa Vista last year when developers demanded the land. She now lives in a dusty tent camp in Viana, where each day hundreds of people line up with jugs and basins, waiting for a truck that brings their daily supply of water.
"There's no water, no stores, no transportation," she said. And there are no houses like the ones those relocated say they were promised.
"We are not only demoralized," she said. "We are angry at the government's lies."

HEADLINE: White House Letter; 
On Asian Trip, a Few Stumbles

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

 BODY:
Choreographing a trip like the one President Bush took to Asia last week requires months of planning, hundreds of people and an obsession with the smallest details. Aides carefully put down tape indicating just where Mr. Bush and Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi of Japan were to stand for a handshake photographed on a bridge over a small pool at Iikura House, the Foreign Ministry's conference center, before a lunch featuring the finest Japanese sake and a 1996 Batard-Montrachet from Louis Latour.
 Inevitably, a few things still went awry. 
 There was, for example, the incident in China that seemed to be a flat tire on the presidential limousine. As Mr. Bush's motorcade sped through Beijing, en route to lunch with President Jiang Zemin near the Forbidden City, the motorcade suddenly stopped for what appeared to be a blown tire on Mr. Bush's car. "Blowout," the wire services called it, conjuring images of the limousine pulled to the side of the road, jacked up by frantic Secret Service agents rummaging through the trunk for a spare.
In fact, the problem was mechanical, Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary, explained.
No matter. Mr. Bush always travels with a spare limousine, which was swiftly brought to the disabled car. "It's actually a practiced drill that the Secret Service carries out," Mr. Fleischer said. Mr. Bush quickly moved from one limousine to the other, and the motorcade sped off.
Then there was the dip of Japan's yen against the dollar after Mr. Bush misspoke during a joint news conference with Mr. Koizumi. Answering a question about discussions between the two leaders over the ailing Japanese economy, Mr. Bush said Mr. Koizumi had just told him that he had things under control. "And he talked about nonperforming loans, the devaluation issue and regulatory reform," Mr. Bush said. "And he placed equal emphasis on all three."
Mr. Bush had not meant to say "devaluation" but "deflation," to describe Japan's falling prices, which Mr. Fleischer said was written on a note card that the president took to the lectern. By saying "devaluation," Mr. Bush inadvertently alluded to discussions in the international marketplace suggesting that a way out of Japan's economic crisis would be to devalue the yen against the dollar, making Japanese products cheaper in other countries. If Mr. Bush was briefed on the Japanese economy before the trip, both words probably came up.
At the end of the news conference, the president's national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, called the mistake to Mr. Bush's attention. "Did I say that?" Mr. Fleischer quoted the president as saying. "My card says 'deflation.' " Reporters were swiftly alerted to the president's mistake, and the yen bounced back. The official White House transcript of the news conference was issued later with a handy footnote. Not one but two asterisks appeared next to the word "devaluation." At the bottom of the page was the word "**deflation," with no further explanation deemed necessary.
The next day, the president had trouble pronouncing a Japanese word in a speech to the Diet, Japan's parliament. Mr. Bush, who is not known for his flawless syntax in his native tongue, pronounced the Japanese word kyoso, which means competition, as "kyo-sho," which means, appropriately, big speech.
Mr. Bush also had trouble pronouncing the name of a Japanese scholar and statesman, Inazo Nitobe, who said in the 1880's that he wanted to be Japan's bridge to the West. Mr. Bush pronounced the name as "Ni-toy-bay," rather than "Ni-to-bay." It was hardly a major faux pas, but by the time Mr. Bush got to Beijing, it was hard not to notice that he omitted the name of Liu Yongqing, the wife of Hu Jintao, the Chinese leader-in-the-wings, from a speech to students at Tsinghua University. Although the name appeared in his prepared text, Mr. Bush breezed past it, referring only to Mr. Hu's "gracious wife."
At another point in Beijing, Mr. Bush used the word "apoplectic" and the phrase "chomping at the bit" in a high-level meeting, causing some confusion among his hosts and their interpreters. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell later told reporters on Air Force One that it took him some time to explain to the Chinese vice foreign minister over lunch exactly what "apoplectic" meant, and even longer to deconstruct "chomping at the bit," which he said "does not translate easily into Chinese."
Reporters were far more interested in the president's use of "apoplectic." In what context did he say it?
"Well, we'll just leave that to private, diplomatic conversations," Mr. Powell said.
The reporters persisted. The president wasn't describing, for example, the European reaction to his "axis of evil" formulation of Iraq, Iran and North Korea?
"No, it's just that some people get excited, and he used it in that context," replied Mr. Powell, who earlier had said that France's foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine, was "getting the vapors" after Mr. Vedrine dismissed Mr. Bush's approach to Iran, Iraq and North Korea as "simplistic."
In Tokyo, Mr. Powell clarified his remark, calling it "a 19th-century Victorian term, if you wish to look it up," that was meant to say, "Let's not swoon."

HEADLINE: Utah's Changes May Be as Fleeting as Olympic Glory 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: SALT LAKE CITY, Feb. 24 

 BODY:
For nearly three weeks, downtown streets here, normally deserted after 6 p.m., were crowded well into the night. Store signs spoke in a rainbow of languages. Public squares were filled with exhibitions and entertainment.
 The Winter Olympics, a jewel that cities spend millions to acquire, transformed Salt Lake City, bringing it a rich diversity of culture and languages to lift it into the league of cosmopolitan centers. Downtown felt more like New York or Paris than Salt Lake's poky old self. 
 "I've never seen Salt Lake City quite like this," Brian Challis, an artist from a Salt Lake suburb said the other day, marveling at the throngs walking the streets. A ticket scalper from Manchester, England, who gave his name only as Simon, stood on a busy corner and said, "Seems like this is America's hidden secret, doesn't it?"
But is it, really? What happens now? What happens with the show moving on, visitors leaving and traditional issues, like Utah's $200 million budget deficit, nudging their way back into view and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which agreed to a muted role during the Olympics, moving back to the forefront of daily life?
During seven years of planning, state and local leaders looked longingly into their Olympic future, half promising, half hoping that Salt Lake's 17 days with destiny would change forever the profile of a city known best as the Mormon capital of the world and of a state known widely for its staggering conservatism and homogeneity, owing to the influence of the church.
Yet it remains far from clear to what degree, if any, those enduring aspirations might be achieved.
Some buds of change are evident. New roads, light-rail lines and hotels reflect part of the $4 billion in construction that preceded the Olympics. Gov. Michael O. Leavitt, a Republican who predicted the Games would bring new businesses to the state, spent much of the last two weeks squiring around venture capitalists, promoting Utahans' work ethic and high educational level.
Utah ski resorts, which have often played second fiddle to those in Colorado, have now been seen by a television audience of several billion, an almost certain boon for local tourism. Tourism officials say the competition sites built for the Olympics, like the luge and bobsled runs, could turn Utah into a winter sports center.
"This is a launch, not a landing," said Mr. Leavitt, assessing the effect of the Olympics on the region.
But all that reflects a potential economic effect of the Olympics, which concluded tonight. Harder to predict is whether they might serve as a sociological crowbar, opening Utah to new ideas through culture and political shifts.
As one of the fastest-growing states, with a population of 2.2 million, Utah remains fiercely Republican. Its only Democrat among three members of Congress, Representative Jim Matheson of Salt Lake City, was the bull's-eye of a redistricting plan that diluted his concentration of Democrats to make him vulnerable to a Republican challenger this year. The Utah Legislature is overwhelmingly Republican, as are almost all judges and county officials.
Most of them are Mormon, reflecting a church to which 70 percent of state residents belong. In addition, almost 90 percent of state residents are white. 
As a result, any change that would dent majorities is viewed with a high degree of apprehension. Chic and diverse, such as they are in Utah, play well only here in Salt Lake City, where just fewer than half the 181,000 residents are Mormons, where voters have elected a Democrat as mayor, Ross C. Anderson, and where the populations of minorities like blacks, Hispanics, Asians, gays and lesbians are growing.
Some experts predict that by drawing in tens of thousands of outsiders, the Olympics will transform Salt Lake City and Utah.
"The Olympics are now part of the state's history, and they are going to have an impact," said Theresa Martinez, a professor of sociology at the University of Utah. "Whether the L.D.S. church wants it or not, they will lead to a new openness and consideration of the more liberal side of things."
Still, evidence suggests that even in the state's largest city, change comes only grudgingly. At the downtown Nordstrom department store here, racks upon racks of women's designer shoes were displayed with great prominence these last few weeks, but their shelf life was short. 
"They were brought in just for the Olympics," a sales clerk said last week. "On Monday, they all go back to the West Coast."
Some economic signs are not encouraging, despite the nightly crowds. Mr. Challis said sadly that the gallery on Main Street that he has been sharing with other artists for the Olympics is scheduled to return on Monday to its former self, an unoccupied storefront. Business owners outside the downtown ring complained steadily that they accrued little benefit from so many visitors to the city.
Only time will reveal which snapshot of the last few weeks might foretell the future of the city and state. Taking the bright side, Ms. Martinez suggested looking at Utah like "a dull, awkward child" suddenly energized and polished by the possibilities of life. 
"The liberal elements have always been here," she said. "That's going to receive new fuel and strength from all this, and I think the L.D.S. church will be transformed, as well."
As for residents of the state, she was less certain the Olympics would alter their politics. Noting that so many visitors had a good time in a safe and festive atmosphere, she said the locals might take that as a positive reflection of themselves.
People here, she said, "want to be accepted, it goes so deep. I'm sure they are feeling, 'Wow, aren't we proud?' and maybe now they have a sense that other people might like them, after all."

HEADLINE: Bush's Hopes of Making A Republican Governor Of California Hit a Snag 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 23 

 BODY:
President Bush has been careful not to appear to take sides in the Republican primary for governor of California. But when he spotted one candidate, Richard J. Riordan, on his trip here last month, Mr. Bush could not help himself.
 "He came up to me and said, 'Hi, Governor!' " Mr. Riordan recalled in an interview. "That felt pretty good." 
 But Mr. Riordan, the former two-term mayor of Los Angeles, is no longer so cheery or confident about his chances, and neither are the White House officials who quietly recruited him to wrest back the governorship of the most populous state.
In barely two weeks, Mr. Riordan has tumbled from the heady perch of inevitable Republican nominee. He is struggling to put down an unexpectedly potent challenge from an old friend, Bill Simon Jr., a multimillionaire businessman and former federal prosecutor who has never before sought public office. The primary is March 5.
Mr. Riordan's shift in fortunes came largely because Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, viewed him as the most daunting threat to his re-election in November. So in an unusual move late last month, Mr. Davis injected himself in the Republican primary by inundating the state with more than $8 million in television commercials that almost exclusively mocked Mr. Riordan -- whose moderate, even liberal, stands on social issues are close to Mr. Davis's own -- as a flake who flip-flopped on abortion and other issues.
While Mr. Davis was bloodying Mr. Riordan, Mr. Simon and another Republican candidate, Bill Jones, the secretary of state, began pounding him with their own, more modest advertisements, which questioned Mr. Riordan's party fealty.
Lamenting his new predicament, Mr. Riordan, who had encouraged Mr. Simon to run before entering the race himself, said, "I haven't had so much fun since my dog died."
Yet even some Riordan backers say Mr. Riordan himself is to blame for his faltering campaign. He was so certain of winning the primary, they say, that he immediately plunged into a campaign against Mr. Davis, never courting the steadfast conservative Republicans who are crucial to victory in the primary.
Many leading Republicans still view Mr. Riordan as the favorite; others call the race a tossup. Mr. Riordan said his campaign's own polling shows Mr. Simon closing in. Mr. Riordan has been forced to discard what he calls his strategy of "running a campaign against Davis," to focus heavily on Mr. Simon.
A loss by Mr. Riordan would be humiliating not only for him but also for the White House, which turned to him as Mr. Bush's best hope of gaining a foothold in California, with the largest cache of electoral votes, and of rebuilding a state party still staggering from Mr. Davis's 1998 victory.
Although the state, one of the most heavily Democratic in the country, overwhelmingly favored Al Gore in 2000, Mr. Bush's advisers have been determined to win the governorship there. They believe a Republican chief executive would, at the very least, force the Democratic presidential candidate in 2004 to lavish resources on California. 
Mr. Riordan, 71, who made a fortune as a specialist in corporate takeovers, has become a juicy target because, unlike his rivals, he favors abortion rights, gun control and gay rights. He has also showered tens of thousands of dollars on Democratic candidates, including Mr. Davis.
Asked in an interview which California governors he most admired, he did not cite Ronald Reagan, an icon in the party, but two who presided over the state's economic boom: Earl Warren, a Republican, and Edmund G. Brown Sr., a Democrat. In an interview, Mr. Simon did not hesitate, "Obviously, Ronald Reagan." 
Despite Mr. Riordan's lack of devotion to many Republican positions, Mr. Bush's advisers urged him to run, so determined were they to find a candidate with popular appeal in the general election.
Early on, Mr. Riordan said, he was encouraged to run not only by Mr. Bush but by Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's top political adviser, and Ken Mehlman, the White House political director. "They were the two main people," Mr. Riordan said. "But the White House is trying to keep their fingerprints off the campaign because the president's supposed to be nonpartisan in the primary."
He acknowledged, though, that the president checked in from time to time. Several weeks ago, Mr. Bush "was on the balcony of the White House when he called me," Mr. Riordan said. "He encouraged me, saying something like, 'Go to it!" '
Today, at a Republican Latino event in Los Angeles, Riordan operatives were not subtle about making the Bush connection. They set up life-size cardboard cutouts of a smiling Mr. Bush throughout the hotel -- and they fastened a Riordan campaign button on the presidential lapel. 
White House advisers said that Mr. Riordan was essentially the last prospect standing. Mr. Jones is the only statewide elected Republican, but Bush aides have not forgiven him for defecting to Senator John McCain of Arizona in the Republican presidential primaries. They said they viewed Mr. Simon as inexperienced and a plodding campaigner.
"Jones betrayed Bush, so they didn't go with him," said Tirso Del Junco, a political veteran here who once led the California Republican Party. "Simon was the new kid on the block, and they misread his effectiveness and resources." Mr. Del Junco added that Mr. Riordan "could have approached the party much more aggressively and painted himself as Mr. Republican."
Many conservatives are disappointed by what they see as Mr. Riordan's flaunting of his support of issues like abortion rights while giving no attention to Republican causes or the party organization.
Mr. Riordan, who is known for his impulsive style, committed a faux pas at a debate this month when he was asked about former Gov. George Deukmejian's comments in a commercial questioning his character. "George has a bad memory," Mr. Riordan said. "The only things he remembers are grudges."
The remark drew gasps from the audience, and he quickly apologized, saying his Irish humor had fallen flat. But he infuriated Republicans who are still much more devoted to Mr. Deukmejian than the Republican who succeeded him, Pete Wilson.
"Dick may not have meant it maliciously," said Dan Schnur, a strategist who advised Mr. Riordan before he entered the race last year, "but at a California Republican convention, the only worse thing you could do would be to say something mean about Reagan, Lincoln or Jesus." 
In the interview here, Mr. Riordan dismissed the criticism as fueled by "some of the right-wingers." He offered no apologies for keeping conservatives at a distance.
"I'm being myself, and I'd feel disingenuous if I was anything different," he said.
The Davis camp, which had hoped its advertising assault would cripple Mr. Riordan for the general election, is euphoric that he may not even survive to November.

Buicks, Starbucks and Fried Chicken. Still China?

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Feb. 24 

 BODY:
Du Yun maneuvered the large orange shopping cart into PriceSmart's parking lot, where she popped open the trunk of her gray economy Buick and began to fill it with plastic-bagged groceries.
 "I come here once a week, sometimes twice -- it's so convenient," said Ms. Du, a working actress, who wore her hair twisted up in a casual clip. "There was nothing like this in China in the past." 
 In the last two years, Ms. Du and her husband -- double income, no kids -- have taken out mortgages to buy an apartment as well as the car, a Buick Sail, which they consider economical. Her husband is waiting for the day when they can afford a snappier second vehicle -- preferably a Jeep.
Ms. Du, 29, likes to cook traditional Chinese food, but with her 6-year-old niece visiting, they will probably go to Colonel Sanders KFC this weekend. For anniversaries, she and her husband favor T.G.I. Fridays. "I really like the atmosphere there," she said.
During President Bush's visit to Beijing last week, leaders of these two powerful nations were politely at odds on many issues. But ordinary people in China's cities have found much common ground with Americans , with the way they live converging rapidly in the marketplace.
In the last few years, China's major cities have sprouted American stores and restaurants at prodigious rates, including Starbucks, PriceSmart, Pizza Hut, McDonald's and Esprit clothing outlets. New housing compounds bear names like Orange County and Manhattan Gardens. A high-end Buick is a sought-after luxury car, a replacement for last year's Audi.
Europeans may be wont to view every Big Mac as a terrifying sign of American cultural imperialism, but Chinese have mostly welcomed the invasion -- indeed they have internalized it 
In one recent survey, nearly half of all Chinese children under 12 identified McDonald's as a domestic brand, according to Beijing's Horizon Market Research. Like a seed falling on fertile soil, each new Western chain store seems to generate a group of slightly cheaper domestic clones nearby.
"Chinese people these days have a very positive impression of American commercial culture and popular culture," said Victor Yuan, president of Horizon. "American products have been a new approach to bridge the gap between the cultures -- a kind of commercial diplomacy."
It is in some ways an odd affection, given that most Chinese remain distrustful of the American government, seeing it as something of a bully. Several years back there was a short spate of press commentaries suggesting that China should develop its own fast food products to defeat the intruders. But such views are rarely heard today and the numbers speak for themselves.
There are now 80 McDonald's in Beijing alone, a figure that has accelerated greatly in the past two years. The number of Kentucky Fried Chicken outlets has increased by 100 a year for the last 2 years, to about 600.
Shanghai and Beijing each have more than two dozen Starbucks. Most Chinese never drank coffee until Starbucks came to town in 1999, selling small lattes for over $2. "They go there to impress a friend or because it's a symbol of a new kind of lifestyle," Mr. Yuan said.
PriceSmart, which tentatively opened its first store here in 1997, now has 18, and plans to have 70 by the end of 2003.
"My daughter, who's 16, wants to go to the U.S.," said Gao Fugui, a businessman, "but for me there's no point -- I have basically the same life here." Mr. Gao, 45, was piling beer (domestic) and wine (imported) into his brand new sport utility vehicle, with silhouettes of skiers on the side and faux leopard covers on the seats.
"Comparing life 10 years ago to now is like heaven and earth," he said. "The quality of life has improved, the country's improved, even people's ideas have changed."
A decade ago no one would have predicted that the texture of leisure for China's emerging urban middle class would have such an American feel. There are hip bars for evening. Mall shopping and miniature golf for day. Ski resorts for winter. Water parks for summer.
"I like American products, especially clothes and cosmetics -- I really follow the styles," said Jiang Sha, 24, who in a white down jacket and blue turtleneck took a lunch break from her job at an environmental monitoring company.
Ms. Jiang said she ate Western fast food many times each week. "Why not? It's simple and fast, suited to my lifestyle."
In the 1980's, companies from other Asian countries were far better poised to enter the huge Chinese market, Mr. Yuan said; they shared a culture and, in the case of Taiwan, a language. But, he said, the Western companies did a far better job of getting to know the rapidly changing tastes of the Chinese consumer, even picking local names with great care.
Perhaps the crowning example of brilliant naming is Coca-Cola -- Ke Kou Ke Le, which sounds quite similar to the product's English name but translates as "really tasty really fun."
Over time, Western products and stores have gained a reputation for high quality and good service, Mr. Yuan said. But he added that in some ways the actual products were beside the point.
"The Americans here are selling not just products but a culture," Mr. Yuan said, "and it is a culture that many Chinese want. 
While the Western chains are thriving, it is often the lightning-fast emergence of Chinese-owned copycat stores that has really spread lifestyle changes to the masses. These stores tend to cater to Chinese who can not quite afford the imports. Ms. Du, the actress, could now also buy her groceries at the domestic Jing Kelong shopping warehouse that opened just next door to PriceSmart. It is part of a rapidly expanding and aptly named chain: the "Jing" comes from Beijing and the "Kelong" is pronounced the same as the Chinese word for clone.

HEADLINE: Governors Say States Need More Federal Help to Deal With Rising Costs of Medicaid 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 24 

 BODY:
The nation's governors demanded today that Congress and President Bush take immediate action to slow the explosive growth of Medicaid, which they say has become unsustainable in its current form.
 Medicaid dominated discussions today at the winter meeting of the National Governors Association. State officials sounded a note of desperation as they sought ways to control health spending. 
 Governors said that Medicaid, the health insurance program for 44 million people, had been eating up all the additional revenues states had collected in recent years. 
"It's a major crisis," said Gov. Paul E. Patton of Kentucky, a Democrat who is vice chairman of the governors association. "We have universal agreement that something needs to be done."
In a new policy statement, the governors said, "The current fiscal crisis for states, compounded by unsustainable growth in the Medicaid program, is creating a situation in which states are faced with either making massive cuts in programs or being forced to raise taxes significantly."
Medicaid provides coverage for low-income people, including one-fifth of all children. It helps pay for one-third of births and two-thirds of nursing home residents in the United States, and it is, after education, the largest program in most state budgets.
State revenues were stagnant or declined in many states last year. But Medicaid costs increased 11 percent, and many states reported that spending on prescription drugs, which are covered by Medicaid, rose more than 20 percent.
Today, in the second session of the four-day conference, the governors advanced numerous proposals to control Medicaid spending and pleaded with the federal government for financial help. 
 Congress appears likely to provide some assistance but is unlikely to make fundamental changes in the structure of Medicaid this year.
Medicaid is financed jointly by the federal government and the states. Governors want the federal government to pick up a larger share of the costs, at least for some elderly and disabled people. But federal officials are reluctant to assume more of the cost because, like state officials, they foresee rising costs as baby boomers grow older.
These are some of the governors' other proposals:
*Give states the option of providing Medicaid coverage to legal immigrants who have not become citizens.
*Allow states to charge higher co-payments for drugs and services provided to Medicaid recipients. The maximum co-payment is now $3 for a prescription drug, a doctor's visit, hospital care or other services.
*Expand Medicare coverage of home health care. That would reduce the states' liability for such care under Medicaid. The federal government pays the full cost of Medicare benefits, but an average of only 57 percent of Medicaid costs, with states responsible for the remainder.
*Increase the discounts that drug manufacturers must provide to state Medicaid programs. 
*Freeze or increase federal Medicaid payments to hospitals serving large numbers of poor people. Under existing law, the payments will be cut next year.
*Eliminate cuts in Medicaid payments to public hospitals, scheduled to take effect in March. The cuts result from rules recently adopted by the Bush administration, which said states were siphoning money from the federal treasury without contributing the required amounts of state money.
Gov. John Engler of Michigan, a Republican, said states were particularly concerned about 7 million elderly and disabled people eligible for both Medicaid and Medicare. This group, he said, accounts for 16 percent of Medicaid recipients, but more than 30 percent of all Medicaid spending.
Many of the people with dual eligibility suffer from chronic illnesses and have incomes less than $10,000 a year. Medicaid provides them with coverage for services not covered by Medicare, including outpatient prescription drugs and lengthy stays in nursing homes, which can easily cost $40,000 a year.
The governors also called on Congress to investigate the operation of a 1984 law that regulates competition between makers of brand-name prescription drugs and lower-cost generic medicines.
A resolution adopted by the governors' Committee on Human Resources says Congress should hold hearings this year to see if the law is "contributing to the high cost of prescription drugs."
Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont, a Democrat, said brand-name drug companies were manipulating the law to prolong patent protection for their products, making it more difficult for generic drugs to enter the market.
But the new governor of New Jersey, James E. McGreevey, a Democrat, emphasized the importance of patents as an incentive for companies to conduct research and develop products based on their discoveries. 
"Patent protection encourages investment in intellectual property," Mr. McGreevey said. "It's essential to economic growth."
Governors today also discussed welfare policy, so they could advise Congress on revisiting a 1996 law that abolished the individual entitlement to cash assistance and gives each state a lump sum of federal money to help poor families.
Under the law, families generally cannot receive federal welfare benefits for more than five years, and adults on welfare are required to work.
Wade F. Horn, an assistant secretary of health and human services, said the Bush administration saw no need to change the five-year limit but wanted to give states more freedom to decide what counts as "work activity."
"There is not a single state, to our knowledge, that has had trouble with the five-year time limit, given the fact that they are able to exempt 20 percent of their caseload from the time limit," Mr. Horn told the governors.
But Mr. Horn said the Bush administration was willing to give states more freedom to combine work with job training and education for welfare recipients.
Such combinations, he said, help poor people get jobs and move up the career ladder.
"What the administration would not support," Mr. Horn said, "is going back to a system that provides education first, and for a very, very long time, before there is any expectation of work."

HEADLINE: A City Livelihood May End, One Nickel Bottle at a Time 

BYLINE:  By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
Walter Johnson ticks down the mental list of his appointment calendar. He's a busy man. Most of the week he works his way through Midtown Manhattan, six square blocks each night. Fridays, his best night, he hits the East Side. Eighteen-hour days are not uncommon, he said, nor -- with all the walking -- are some mighty sore feet.
 Mr. Johnson, 52, is hard-working and homeless. He collects and redeems cans and bottles for their 5-cent deposits, making $15 to $30 a night as an entrepreneur in a subsistence economy of nickels. 
 "I don't get any money from welfare or anything else, and I don't ask for nothing," said Mr. Johnson, who came to New York 40 years ago from South Carolina. He became homeless about a decade ago after he lost his job and then his apartment. "This is an honest dollar," he said. 
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's recent proposal to end the 5-cent redemption program -- with buyers still paying the extra nickel but the city keeping the deposit for itself -- would inadvertently destroy the livelihood of the redeemers, as people like Mr. Johnson call themselves. The city wants to use the redemption money essentially as a tax to rebuild a recycling program that the mayor said has become economically untenable in tough times. The big redemption centers and supermarket redemption machines would be eliminated, and the only way people would be able to redeem cans and bottles would be to haul them across city lines.
As for the poor and homeless who might be hurt, Mr. Bloomberg said, the city should be able to do better for them than simply letting them go through the garbage.
The world of the redeemers was never deliberately created. New York State's 20-year-old bottle-deposit law was environmental legislation that only spilled over accidentally into this odd economic niche. It filled a need, sociologists and experts in homelessness say -- creating a market for something that the poor could easily and legally obtain, and that New York City in particular, with its multitude of hotels, nightclubs, conventions and apartment buildings, created in vast abundance.
But the mayor's idea illuminates how intensely complicated and intertwined the happenstance convergence of waste disposal, recycling and poverty have become. Many environmentalists and politicians, for example, credit the bottle law at least in part with cleaner city streets and state highways compared with the 1970's and before, when there was no economic incentive for people to save or collect empties. New York's bottle law -- one of 10 such state laws in the nation -- also came along, by coincidence, at a time in the early 1980's when the numbers of poor and homeless were increasing as housing costs soared and blue-collar jobs disappeared.
The city's mandatory recycling law, which took effect in 1989, completed the circle. Residents were required for the first time to separate refuse into piles -- paper in one pile; glass, metal and plastic in another; and regular trash in the third. Redeemable bottles and cans, if not saved by the original purchaser, were suddenly being set aside in larger numbers than ever, which made the redeemers' work easier. At the same time, apartment building managers found that encouraging redeemers to take away the containers reduced the amount of space that had to be devoted to storage while waiting for the city's recycling trucks to pick them up. 
Solid waste and social policy had merged.
"When they did this bottle bill I don't think they had any idea," said Guy Polhemus, the executive director and founder of We Can, a nonprofit redemption center on Manhattan's West Side that opened in 1987 specifically to work with the poor and homeless. The center pays out, on an average day, $3,000 to $5,000 in deposit money; Mr. Polhemus estimates that there are hundreds of people in the city who survive solely on redeeming bottles and cans. "It's more than a nickel, it's more than people rooting through the garbage. For some people this is the last vestige of their autonomy."
For the city, the economic numbers are also staggeringly attractive. Each year, about 1.64 billion redeemable bottles and cans are sold in New York City -- that's $82 million in nickels, according to the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. Of that total, about $55 million gets paid back out through redemptions, and the rest, about one-third, disappears, probably into landfills and incinerators.
The mayor's plan would convert the nickel deposit into a kind of user fee that would be kept by the city and used to pay for an expanded and reconstituted recycling program in 2004. City officials admit that the questions and details are many. The State Legislature's approval is required to amend the bottle law. Bottles and cans would have to be marked "unredeemable in New York City," even though right across city borders in Westchester and Nassau Counties, stores would still presumably take the empties and have to pay the nickels. 
In the 1980's, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo failed to persuade the Legislature to give him all the nickels from unredeemed cans and bottles to use for an environmental fund -- a fact that has been lost on no one at City Hall.
"The mayor is trying to get everyone to think out of the box," said Lorenzo Cipollina, an assistant commissioner for planning and budget at the city's Department of Sanitation.
Redeemers -- a more diverse group than the stereotype of ragged men, shopping carts and plastic bags would suggest -- are caught in the middle. Only about half of the people who regularly do the work are homeless, according to managers at We Can. In Midtown that percentage is higher, while in poor parts of the city, elderly people and families make up the majority of redeemers. Some redeemers, like Anthony Nowak, 71, a retired factory worker, collect only enough to supplement their monthly Social Security checks.
Others are hard-hitting strivers. Michael Mills, 47, who lives in Brooklyn, said he makes $300 to $400 a week, working 60 to 70 hours over five days. Mr. Mills, who pushes a laundry cart about five miles a day on his can-and-bottle route through Manhattan, dreams of saving up to buy a vehicle that would allow him to expand further. 
"But that's way down the road," he said.
There are elaborate rules and rhythms in can and bottle collecting. A web of relationships has developed over the years between redeemers and the building superintendents who control access to basements and courtyards where trash and bottles and cans for recycling are stored.
For the redeemers, those relationships are crucial, so they stay in good graces by occasionally bringing a cooperative superintendent coffee and doughnuts, or a beer, and by being on time for appointments. Speaking Spanish is also an asset in many buildings.
"It's good to have a rapport," Mr. Johnson said.
But building superintendents also have a self-interest in cultivating responsible redeemers who do not leave a mess behind.
"If they take it away, they help us," said Mohammed Israel, the superintendent at Le Premier, a high-rise apartment building at 55th Street and Broadway that works with three or four regular redeemers.
Often there is a quiet pride that shines through. Many pointedly make the distinction between redeeming and scavenging, which means searching through garbage for anything of value, including edible food. Redeemers hunt for bottles and cans alone -- garbage, they say, is simply the working environment that has to be endured. The process of redemption, many of them say, goes far deeper than money. 
"It's a little fine line, but if you cross over that line, you have to become responsible," said Jim Kelley, 63, who worked at We Can in the late 1980's, after arriving in New York City in a state that he described as homeless, penniless and suicidal. He now manages a $20-million-a-year landscape supply business on Long Island. 
"That's what happened with all of us," Mr. Kelley said, "we found this niche of self-worth, however little it might have been."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: DIPLOMACY; 
In Tehran Visit, Karzai Appeals to Iran and U.S. to Make Up

BYLINE:  By NAZILA FATHI 

DATELINE: TEHRAN, Feb. 24 

 BODY:
The leader of Afghanistan's interim government, Hamid Karzai, visited Tehran today and appealed to Iran and the United States to put aside their differences and help build his war-ravaged country.
 Mr. Karzai, who met with President Mohammad Khatami, praised Iran for the assistance it gave Afghanistan against the Taliban and urged Iran to help Afghanistan develop its education and health systems and rebuild its public works. 
 Iran is the fifth country that Mr. Karzai has visited since taking office in December. His trips -- to Pakistan earlier, Iran now and India later this week -- suggest that he is seeking the friendship and support of his neighbors. 
"Iran is a friend and brother of Afghanistan," Mr. Karzai said, "and we want all countries to contribute to the construction and development of Afghanistan. 
"Iran helped Afghanistan with immense problems. The United States also cooperated to defeat the Taliban. We want all countries to cooperate and contribute to the construction of Afghanistan, even if they have differences."
Mr. Khatami reaffirmed his support for Mr. Karzai's government. He said Iran wanted to help strengthen Afghanistan's interim government and promote the nation's stability and security. 
"The most important service to the Afghan people is to help solidify the government in order to pave the ground for the construction and development of Afghanistan," Mr. Khatami said.
Without mentioning the United States by name, Mr. Khatami referred to the sour relations between the two countries and said those issues would not affect Iran's cooperation with Afghanistan.
"We do not mean to interfere in the internal affairs of Afghanistan," he said, "But, yes, we are concerned to see an independent government and a developed nation, and we will do anything to help create it."
Iran and the United States severed relations after the Islamic revolution of 1979, when hard-line students attacked the American Embassy in Tehran and took its diplomats hostage. After Sept. 11 the two countries became closer and cooperated to bring down the Taliban. Iran, a Shiite Muslim country, had opposed the Sunni Muslim Taliban from the time they gained control of Afghanistan in 1996.
The United States had expressed concern that Iran might be trying to destabilize the Karzai government by giving refuge to Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters and helping Afghan warlords who opposed Mr. Karzai's government.
Iran denied the charges and declared that it had arrested 150 illegal immigrants who were supporters of the Taliban or Al Qaeda.
But the two rival governing factions in Iran, the hard-liners close to the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and the reformist supporters of Mr. Khatami, have expressed differences over Afghanistan.
Hard-liners consider the close presence of Amerian forces in Afghanistan a threat and view America's efforts there, as well as Mr. Karzai's government, with suspicion.
Reformers, on the other hand, consider the costs of instability in Afghanistan too high for Iran. More than two million Afghan refugees who have fled civil war and drought in the last two decades are in Iran.
Iran has also become a major route for the export of Afghanistan's heroin and opium, leading to violent confrontations between traffickers and the Iranian authorities. Addiction has become common in Iran, where drugs have beome cheap and easily obtained.
Iran hopes that development in Afghanistan will lead to the return of refugees and will influence the new government to replace the cultivation of opium poppies with other crops. At the conference on reconstruction of Afghanistan held in Tokyo, Iran pledged $560 million over the next five years.
While in Iran, Mr. Karzai and his delegation of 13 cabinet ministers will discuss the refugee issue as well as the potential for political and economic ties between the two coutnries.
He will meet with Ayatollah Khamei, with the Parliament speaker and with business leaders. In a symbolic gesture to ease relations with hard-liners, Mr. Karzai will pay homage at the shrine of the founder of the Islamic revolution, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.

HEADLINE: Shortchanging Libraries 

 BODY:
On an average day in the city, Spanish-speaking New Yorkers are huddled around computer terminals in East Harlem's Aguilar branch library, learning English with state-of-the-art software, teenagers from poor Brooklyn neighborhoods are discovering the Internet in the Central Library's "technology loft," and parents throughout the city are attending workshops on family reading offered by the innovative Connecting Libraries and Schools Project.
 Mayor Michael Bloomberg's proposed budget for next year calls for a reduction of $39 million, or 15 percent, in library funding citywide. As Mr. Bloomberg points out, these are times of shared sacrifice. Still, his budget recognizes that all areas should not be cut equally -- funding for education and the police would be trimmed by 6 to 7 percent. Because libraries perform a core educational function that is more important than ever, we urge the mayor and the City Council to rescind at least half of the proposed cuts, bringing the library cuts in line with those for the educational system. 
 The stereotype of libraries as musty repositories of old books has never been less true than it is in New York today. The city's libraries are community-based educational centers that serve young and old alike. They're a place where someone out of work because of 9/11 can go to find job listings or learn how to write a resume. Immigrants can attend English-language "conversation circles" led by volunteer tutors. Students can find a quiet, safe place to do homework. In the current economic downturn, the libraries are busier than ever: visits were up 12 percent in the last quarter of 2001, while book circulation rose 19 percent.
The proposed 15 percent cut would hit neighborhood libraries especially hard. The research libraries, like the Humanities and Social Sciences Library at Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street, would be relatively unscathed, since much of their funding is private. But the branches would be forced to cut hours and even whole days, and to reduce their acquisition budgets. It is unlikely that the system will return to the dark days of the early 1990's, when branches were open as few as three days a week. But the budget cut would inevitably diminish access for the city's poorest children to books, magazines, computers and help with homework.
There is not much fat in current library budgets. Many librarians with advanced degrees earn less than $35,000. The city's library systems have been adept at bringing in private money and outside partners for programs like the cutting-edge "Click on @ the Library" computer instruction initiative, and "Poetry in the Branches," a program of poetry reading and writing that is a national model.
Today's libraries are even skillful marketers, aggressively introducing themselves to a new generation of potential users who have been raised on television and video games. Last summer, the Brooklyn Public Library blanketed the borough with ads for its "Get the Card" program, sponsored in conjunction with the Brooklyn Cyclones, a minor-league affiliate of the Mets. About 75,000 Brooklynites, many of them first-time library users, signed up for the limited-edition card, co-branded with the Cyclones logo. 
Next year's budget will not be finished until June, and the City Council, long a champion of the libraries, has yet to be heard from. There is no easy way to close a budget gap of the size Mr. Bloomberg found waiting for him. Still, it will benefit New Yorkers tremendously if, as the budget process continues, money is found to soften the blow to one of the most vital, well-loved parts of city government.

HEADLINE: When Humans Became Human 

BYLINE:  By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD 

 BODY:
On the biggest steps in early human evolution scientists are in agreement. The first human ancestors appeared between five million and seven million years ago, probably when some apelike creatures in Africa began to walk habitually on two legs.
 They were flaking crude stone tools by 2.5 million years ago. Then some of them spread from Africa into Asia and Europe after two million years ago. 
 With somewhat less certainty, most scientists think that people who look like us -- anatomically modern Homo sapiens -- evolved by at least 130,000 years ago from ancestors who had remained in Africa. Their brain had reached today's size. They, too, moved out of Africa and eventually replaced nonmodern human species, notably the Neanderthals in Europe and parts of Asia, and Homo erectus, typified by Java Man and Peking Man fossils in the Far East. 
But agreement breaks down completely on the question of when, where and how these anatomically modern humans began to manifest creative and symbolic thinking. That is, when did they become fully human in behavior as well as body? When, and where, was human culture born?
"It's the hot issue, and we all have different positions," said Dr. John E. Yellen, an archaeologist with the National Science Foundation.
For much of the last century, archaeologists thought that modern behavior flowered relatively recently, 40,000 years ago, and only after Homo sapiens had pushed into Europe. They based their theory of a "creative explosion" on evidence like the magnificent cave paintings in Lascaux and Chauvet. 
But some rebellious researchers suspected that this theory was a relic of a time when their discipline was ruled by Eurocentrism. Archaeologists, the rebels contended, were simply not looking for earlier creativity in the right places.
Several recent discoveries in Africa and the Middle East are providing the first physical evidence to support an older, more gradual evolution of modern behavior, one not centered in Europe. But other scientists, beyond acknowledging a few early sparks in Africa, remain unswayed. One prominent researcher is putting forward a new hypothesis of genetic change to explain a more recent and abrupt appearance of creativity.
The debate has never been so intense over what archaeologists see as the dawn of human culture.
"Europe is a little peninsula that happens to have a large amount of spectacular archaeology," said Dr. Clive Gamble, director of the Center for the Archaeology of Human Origins at the University of Southampton in England. "But the European grip of having all the evidence is beginning to slip. We're finding wonderful new evidence in Africa and other places. And in the last two or three years, this has changed and widened the debate over modern human behavior."
The uncertainty and confusion over the origin of modern cultural behavior stem from what appears to be a great time lag between the point when the species first looked modern and when it acted modern. Perhaps the first modern Homo sapiens emerged with a capacity for modern creativity, but it remained latent until needed for survival.
"The earliest Homo sapiens probably had the cognitive capability to invent Sputnik," said Dr. Sally McBrearty, an anthropologist at the University of Connecticut. "But they didn't yet have the history of invention or a need for those things."
Perhaps the need arose gradually in response to stresses of new social conditions, environmental change or competition from nonmodern human species. Or perhaps the capacity for modern behavior came late, a result of some as yet undetected genetic transformation.
Dr. Mary C. Stiner, an archaeologist at the University of Arizona, said those contrasting views, or variations of them, could be reduced to this single question: "Was there some fundamental shift in brain wiring or some change in conditions of life?"

Sudden Genetic Advance
The foremost proponent of the traditional theory that human creativity appeared suddenly and mainly in Europe is Dr. Richard G. Klein, a Stanford archaeologist. He describes his reasoning in a new book, "The Dawn of Creativity," written with Blake Edgar and being published next month by John Wiley.
"Arguably, the 'dawn' was the most significant prehistoric event that archaeologists will ever detect," the authors write. "Before it, human anatomical and behavioral change proceeded very slowly, more or less hand in hand. Afterward, the human form remained remarkably stable, while behavioral change accelerated dramatically. In the space of less than 40,000 years, ever more closely packed cultural 'revolutions' have taken humanity from the status of a relatively rare large mammal to something more like a geologic force."
In that view, 40,000 years ago was the turning point in human creativity, when modern Homo sapiens arrived in Europe and left the first unambiguous artifacts of abstract and symbolic thought. They were making more advanced tools, burying their dead with ceremony and expressing a new kind of self-awareness with beads and pendants for body ornamentation and in finely wrought figurines of the female form. As time passed, they projected on cave walls something of their lives and minds in splendid paintings of deer, horses and wild bulls.
As an explanation for this apparently abrupt flowering of creativity, Dr. Klein has proposed a neurological hypothesis. About 50,000 years ago, he contends, a chance genetic mutation in effect rewired the brain in some critical way, possibly allowing for a significant advance in speech. The origin of human speech is another of evolution's mysteries. Improved communications at this time, in his view, could have enabled people "to conceive and model complex natural and social circumstances" and thus give them "the fully modern ability to invent and manipulate culture."
Although this transformation, with the genetic change leading to the behavioral change, occurred in Africa, Dr. Klein writes, it allowed "human populations to colonize new and challenging environments." 
On reaching Europe, the rewired modern humans, called the Cro-Mag nons, presumably outsmarted the resident Neanderthals, driving them to extinction by 30,000 years ago, and leaving their indelible cultural mark on the land.
Dr. Klein concedes that the idea "fails one important measure of a proper scientific hypothesis -- it cannot be tested or falsified by experiment or by examination of relevant human fossils." 
Skulls from that time show no change in brain size and are highly unlikely to show a genetic change in the brain's functioning. Although he considers the idea the most straightforward explanation, critics object that such a concept of an abrupt "human revolution" is too simplistic, as well as being unprovable.
Besides, other archaeologists think it misguided to key interpretations so closely to the Cro-Magnon creative explosion, dazzling as it was. Such thinking might have been understandable, they say, when few archaeologists had investigated earlier sites elsewhere, and the little they found could not -- and still cannot -- match the artistic magnificence of Lascaux and Chauvet. 

The Blombos Discoveries
But the Eurocentrism of old may have sown the seeds of its demise. As Dr. Yellen points out, the increasing research into the origins of modern behavior has been driven in part by a lively interest in explaining the source and nature of Cro-Magnon superiority in overwhelming the Neanderthals.
In the last 30 years, scientists have learned that the Cro-Magnons originated in Africa and the Neanderthals seem to have evolved exclusively in Europe. So archaeologists have begun searching more diligently in Africa for what they generally agree are attributes of early modern behavior like more complex stone technology, the introduction of tools made of bone, long-distance trade, a more varied diet, self-ornamentation and abstract designs carved on tools and ocher.
In a comprehensive study two years ago, Dr. McBrearty at UConn and Dr. Alison S. Brooks of George Washington University said the many artifacts indicative of modern behavior in Africa did "not occur suddenly together, as predicted by the 'human revolution' model, but at sites that are widely separated in space and time."
"This suggests," the scientists said, "a gradual assembling of the package of modern human behaviors in Africa and its later export to other regions of the Old World."
Exploring a cave at the southern tip of Africa, for example, Dr. Christopher Henshilwood of the South African Museum in Cape Town found evidence that the anatomically modern people there were turning animal bones into awls and finely polished weapon points more than 70,000 years ago. 
The skill for making such bone tools is considered more advanced in concept and application than that required in producing the usual stone tools.
Three weapon points, in particular, appear to have been shaped first with a stone blade and then polished, probably with a piece of leather and a mineral powder.
"Why so finely polished?" Dr. Henshilwood asked. "It's actually unnecessary for projectile points to be so carefully made. It suggests to us that this is an expression of symbolic thinking. The people said, 'Let's make a really beautiful object.' "
Symbolic thinking, scientists explain, is a form of consciousness that extends beyond the here and now to a contemplation of the past and future and a perception of the world within and beyond one individual. Thinking and communicating through abstract symbols is the foundation of all creativity, art and music, language and, more recently, mathematics, science and the written word. 
Last month, Dr. Henshilwood reported details of an even more striking 77,000-year-old find at the Blombos Cave site. Two small pieces of ocher, a soft red iron oxide stone, had been inscribed with crisscrossed triangles and horizontal lines. The decoration, made by the same cave dwellers, was more evidence, the archaeologist said, that "we're pushing back the date of symbolic thinking in modern humans -- far, far back."
Previous excavations in the Katanda region of Congo yielded barbed harpoon points carved out of bone 80,000 to 90,000 years ago. Dr. Brooks and Dr. Yellen, her husband, found that these ancient people "not only possessed considerable technological capabilities at this time, but also incorporated symbolic or stylistic content into their projectile forms."
The dating of the Blombos discoveries, once suspect, is now generally accepted by other archaeologists. But a few have challenged the interpretations. If the artifacts are really that old and represent a basic change in human culture, why are they not showing up all over? 
Noting that no similar artifacts had been found in at least 30 other sites in the region of Blombos, Dr. Klein said the "unique find" did not justify a revision of ideas about when and where modern behavior began.
Dr. Yellen disagrees. The population of modern Homo sapiens then was small and probably widely scattered, he explained, and so ideas and cultural practices might have been slow to travel among different groups.
"Think about trying to start a fire with too little tinder," Dr. Yellen said. "You make sparks. But it takes a certain density of the stuff before the fire is going to catch and go somewhere. So when you don't have other people in your face, you probably won't get or don't need the richness of behavior that came later."

The Social Factor
Variations on this theme are offered in other attempts to explain scattered finds suggesting the presence of modern cultural behavior outside Europe before the Cro-Mag non efflorescence.
Dr. Stiner and her husband, Dr. Steven L. Kuhn, both archaeologists at the University of Arizona, said their research in Turkey and Lebanon showed that people around 43,000 years ago were making and wearing strings of beads and shell ornaments of highly repetitive designs. Some of the shells were relatively rare marine varieties, luminous white or brightly colored. The bone of an eagle or vulture was incised for suspension as a pendant.
These were presumably objects of social communication, readily conveying information about kinship, status and other aspects of identity to outsiders.
"Ornamentation is universal among all modern human foragers," Dr. Stiner said. Not to mention in complex societies that send social signals with wedding rings, designer clothes and hot-label sneakers.
At the Mediterranean coastal dig sites of the Ucagizli Cave in Turkey and Ksar Akil in Lebanon, in the corridor of migrations into Eurasia, the two archaeologists also found remains of animal bones, indicating a marked change in diet over time. The people there were eating fewer deer, wild cattle and other large animals. They seemed to be hunting and gathering fewer of the slow-reproducing and easy-to-catch animals like shellfish and tortoises and more of the agile animals like birds and hares.
Their living conditions had changed, Dr. Stiner and Dr. Kuhn surmised, and one cause could have been population increases that pressured their resources. Not that the region suddenly teemed with people, but where populations had been sparse, even modest increases could double or triple their numbers, forcing them to turn to lower-ranked food sources. 
Families and groups would be living in closer proximity, with more occasions to interact, which could account for the creation of so many body ornaments as part of a shared system of communication, signaling from afar to outsiders one's group identity and social status 
"Expressions of who you are had become much more important," Dr. Stiner said.
In a report in June in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the two archaeologists noted that this "habitual production and use of standardized ornaments first appeared at about the same time" at two other widely separated sites, in Kenya and Bulgaria. That implied "the existence of certain cognitive capacities and that these evolved relatively late in prehistory," the two researchers said, but they were probably not a consequence of a sudden genetic mutation.
"The fact that traditions of ornament making emerged almost simultaneously in the earliest Upper Paleolithic/Late Stone Age on three continents argues strongly against their corresponding to a specific event in the cognitive evolution of a single population," Dr. Stiner and Dr. Kuhn said.
Dr. Gamble, a visiting professor at Boston University this semester, attributed this changed behavior less to specific population pressures than to generally increasing social competition. The response was new strategies for procuring food, sharing ideas and knowledge and organizing their societies. This would have been an advantage to societies as they moved into new lands and dealt with new circumstances, including non-modern humans they came in contact with.
"Population pressure didn't get us to the moon in 1969," he said. "There was social competition in the cold war. That's an extreme example, but something like that is what we are seeing in the form of an intensification of social life" at the sites in Turkey and Lebanon.
Along the same lines, Dr. Randall White, an archaeologist at New York University who specializes in Cro-Magnon creativity, said findings of early personal adornment in Africa and the Middle East indicated that the capacity was there and latent long before modern humans reached Europe.
"Already," Dr. White said, "people had a capacity for symbolic thinking. That's important. Then they invented it in response to a certain set of circumstances."
Modern humans, in the face of competition, tapped inner resources for cultural attributes, enabling them to maintain a common identity, communicate ideas and organize societies into "stable, enduring regional groups," Dr. White said. They thereby established a decisive edge over the Neanderthals in Europe and, among other advances, the start of representational art.
The debate over the origins of modern human culture is far from resolved, and with the quickening pace of excavations, the issues may grow even more complex and confused. As archaeologists remind themselves, culture today is hardly uniform from place to place, and it probably never was.

In Corn's Cradle, U.S. Imports Bury Family Farms

BYLINE:  By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: MANZANILLO, Mexico 

 BODY:
For many generations, corn has been the sacred center of civilization in Mexico, the place where the grain was first cultivated some 5,000 years ago. 
 Gods and goddesses of corn filled the dreams and visions of the great civilizations that rose and fell here before the Spaniards came five centuries ago. Today the corn tortilla is consumed at almost every meal. Among the poor, sometimes it is the entire meal. 
 But the modern world is closing in on the little patch of maize, known as the milpa, that has sustained millions of Mexicans through the centuries. The powerful force of American agribusiness, unleashed in Mexico by the North American Free Trade Agreement, may doom the growing of corn as a way of life for family farmers here, agronomists and economists say. 
Lorenzo Rebollo, a 53-year-old dirt farmer, works two and a half acres of corn and beans here on the slopes of the eastern state of Michoacan, in Mexico's central highlands, where corn was first grown as a food crop, archaeologists say. Mr. Rebollo is one of about 3 million Mexicans who farm corn and support roughly 15 million family members. 
His grown sons have left for the United States to make a living, and Mr. Rebollo says he may be the last man to farm this patch of earth. It is the same story all over Mexico: thousands of farmers pulling up stakes every year, heading for Mexico City or the United States. Some grew coffee or cut sugar cane. But most grew corn. 
Roughly a quarter of the corn in Mexico is now imported from the United States. Men like Mr. Rebollo cannot compete against the mechanized, subsidized giants of American agriculture. 
"Corn growing has basically collapsed in Mexico," Carlos Heredia Zubieta, an economist and a member of Mexico's Congress, said in a recent speech to an American audience. "The flood of imports of basic grains has ravaged the countryside, so the corn growers are here instead of working in the fields."
The facts are stark. Since Nafta took effect eight years ago, imports of corn to Mexico from the United States have increased nearly eighteenfold, according to the United States Department of Agriculture. The imports will probably keep growing for the next six years as the final phases of Nafta take effect.
In the United States, corn growers receive billions of dollars a year in subsidies from Congress, much of it going to huge agribusiness operations. That policy fuels huge surpluses and pushes corn prices down.
Free trade and Mexico's own farm policies "threaten the ability of Mexican farmers to continue to grow corn," said Alejandro Nadal, a professor at the Colegio de Mexico and the author of a study on the issue.
In Mexico, Nafta did away with many traditional subsidies and generous price supports. Some contend it is doing away with small farmers. About 90 percent of Mexico's corn farmers work fields of five acres or less, and their survival instincts are driving them farther and farther up Mexico's mountainsides as they strive to grow enough to get by. 
"We work the land all our lives," Mr. Rebollo said. "But the farmers are growing more and getting less." 
Under a slowly lifting ceiling, the United States will be able to export all the corn it wants to Mexico, duty free, by 2008. Nafta's drafters told Mexico's farmers that as the ceiling lifted, the price of corn in Mexico would slowly fall toward United States and international prices over the 15-year period. 
But instead, prices plunged quickly, converging with the free-market price by 1997. This was good news for big companies in Mexico importing corn for animal feed and processed food. But it was hard on the farmers, who have little political clout under the government of President Vicente Fox, an ardent free-trader.
The effect of American imports on Mexican agriculture was not unforeseen. "Integration into the global economy will also accelerate the social dislocation that rapid modernization inevitably brings to a developing economy," Bernard Aronson, a former assistant secretary of state for Latin American affairs, wrote eight years ago as the trade pact took effect.
But some things were not predicted. One unforeseen result of the collapse of corn farming, Mr. Nadal warns, will be the loss of genetically unique kinds of corn. As imports grow and farmers give up their fields, he said, ancient varieties like the succulent blue corn used for tortillas may be endangered. Some may already be lost, he said. 
"If traditional growers abandon corn production -- as the Nafta strategy foresees -- then even more significant genetic erosion will occur," he said.
The importation of bioengineered corn from the United States is a separate but heated issue. Mexico's government does not permit the planting of genetically modified corn. But the new modified breeds can be imported as food or feed. The science journal Nature and Mexico's government published findings last year showing that bioengineered genes from American imports have invaded ancient varieties of corn in the state of Oaxaca.
Nafta has had demonstrable benefits for many sectors of the Mexican economy that have become competitive, and Mr. Fox says it is no longer possible for the government to step in and assist farmers. 
State legislators who want Mexico to protect its corn the way Japan protects its rice have had no luck swaying him. Mr. Fox's agriculture minister, Javier Usabiaga -- a highly successful exporter known as the Garlic King in Guanajuato, his home state as well as Mr. Fox's -- says that a farmer who cannot survive in the 21st century is simply "going to have to find another job." 
Farmers like Mr. Rebollo are regarded as artifacts of an earlier, simpler age. "I have this little bit of land, and I work it, and it's good hard work," he said as he walked his fallow field. "But I think when I go it will go too."

HEADLINE: Why Blacks Support Vouchers 

BYLINE:  By Michael Leo Owens; Michael Leo Owens is visiting assistant professor of political science at Emory University.

DATELINE: ATLANTA 

 BODY:
Urban black America favors school vouchers, but its leaders don't. Vouchers transfer authority over the use of a portion of government education funds from bureaucrats to parents, who then may use their grants to send their children to the schools, secular or religious, they believe will best educate their kids.
 But we must be honest. If the Supreme Court rules in Zelman v. Simmons-Harris that the Cleveland voucher program is constitutional, the decision will help some families, but it will not expand the educational opportunities of all black children. Even so, such a result is likely to increase black support for vouchers. It will also show how far out of touch the black governmental class is with its black constituency. 
 A 1999 survey by Public Agenda, a nonpartisan research group, found that 68 percent of blacks favor vouchers. A similar poll by the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a nonpartisan think tank, showed that the percentage of blacks supporting school vouchers rose to 60 percent in 1999 from 48 percent in 1996.
Support is particularly strong among people in my age group, those between 26 and 35. And support exists broadly among women and men, liberals and conservatives, the poor and the prosperous. 
The Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies found, however, that 69 percent of black federal, state and local elected officials do not support a voucher plan like Cleveland's. They do not believe that public schools are failing our children. Amazingly, almost three-fifths of black politicians rate their local public schools as excellent or good, while by nearly the same percentage other black adults rate their public schools as poor to fair.
Why do I and other African Americans support vouchers over the advice of black politicians? At the most basic level, we are desperate for decent education for our children. And people in my generation and those younger doubt the ability of black government leaders to influence public education policies in ways that would benefit our children. Our support for vouchers is essentially a critique of politicians' ineffectiveness. 
In the post-civil rights era, the number of blacks sharing power and responsibility for urban public education has grown dramatically. From 1977 to 1999, the number of black elected officials with influence over public education in cities (mayors, council members, school board members and superintendents) more than doubled, to 5,815 from 2,724.
Increased black representation in urban public education has had positive symbolic effects. There are more black voices in local education policymaking and more black teachers serving as role models. Nevertheless, the substantive benefits of black electoral representation have been limited. The educational achievement of black children and the overall quality of urban public schools have failed to improve significantly.
Consider the case of Atlanta. Since 1973, the mayors and public school superintendents of Atlanta have all been African American and its school board has had black majorities. The city council likewise has had black majorities for more than 20 years. In 2000, blacks made up 78 percent of the Atlanta system's central office administrators, 95 percent of its school principals and 82 percent of its teachers.
Unfortunately, black bureaucratic enfranchisement has yet to affect black educational achievement. Test scores in the elementary schools in Atlanta's black neighborhoods are substantially worse than scores in public schools located in majority white neighborhoods.
This is very disheartening, for it suggests that even in a city of black electoral empowerment and black wealth, black children have a tough time learning and performing well. This is why so many black parents ignore the counsel of black politicians on how to improve education.
My generation knows that vouchers have serious limitations. We recognize that no voucher program can save a failing public system. Poorly funded vouchers don't offer much of a chance for poor children to enroll in expensive alternative schools. Vouchers can't ensure parental involvement in education. And vouchers can't end the resistance of many suburban schools to black enrollment.
But they offer the only hope available to many poor students trapped in the nation's worst schools. For a limited number of children, they may make a crucial difference. That possibility is enough for black parents to take a chance.

HEADLINE: Angola Rebels Face Disarray Since Death Of Savimbi 

BYLINE:  By HENRI E. CAUVIN 

DATELINE: LUANDA, Angola, Feb. 25 

 BODY:
Like a family that has lost its patriarch, the Angolan rebel group that has battled the government for nearly three decades is learning to live without Jonas Savimbi. If the earliest signs are any indication, it will not be easy.
 Mr. Savimbi was the only leader the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, or Unita, had ever known. He was killed on Friday in an ambush by government soldiers, and since then speculation about the movement's future has been the talk of the capital. 
 The group's first statement since Mr. Savimbi's death, released during the weekend, highlights how much uncertainty there is within the movement itself, analysts said. 
The rebels' high command, unable to convene promptly or communicate regularly, even by phone, is struggling to have its voice heard, but without saying too much too soon.
"Angolans are aware of the difficulties which have been imposed on us," said the statement, "and which are preventing us in this moment of grief from reuniting the family of Unita in order that, in a peaceful manner, we may find the best ways of overcoming such a tragic loss."
Justino Pinto de Andrade, the dean of economics at the Catholic University of Angola, who has been a critic of the government, said: "I think Unita is fragile politically and militarily. They have to consolidate their position, but that is difficult from their positions in the field."
The rebel movement, once in control of some of the country's major interior cities, has been driven into the bush in the last couple of years. It now operates as a guerrilla force, roving the country on hit-and-run missions intended to wreak instability.
Speaking today in Portugal, Angola's president, Jose Eduardo dos Santos, called for a prompt cease-fire, which he said would set the stage for the country's first elections since 1992. "It all depends on the good will of those who still have arms in," said Mr. dos Santos, who is to meet with President Bush in Washington on Tuesday.
But a political leader of the rebels, along with people who track them, said that if the government was serious, it would have to slow, and perhaps even halt, its crushing eastern offensive, which killed Mr. Savimbi and may now threaten some of his top lieutenants.
"If they make military pressure in the bush, it will be very difficult to create confidence and to create bridges," said Jaka Jamba, a leading Unita member of Parliament.
Andre Thomashausen, a professor at the University of South Africa and an expert on the rebel movements of the region, said the Angolan government should understand that pressing forward would yield short-term military success but not long-term social gains.
The rebel movement is rooted in the country's largest ethnic group, the Ovimbundu, and won more than 40 percent of the vote in the country's only multiparty election, and that cannot be overlooked, Mr. Thomashausen said.
"It may be 10 years ago," he said, "but half the nation voted for this man and they see in him their unfortunate leader, so there's a lot of grief, there's a lot of confusion and there's fear."
Hannelie de Beer, who was a South African military intelligence officer specializing in Angola when South Africa was backing the rebels, said they would take their cues from the government. 
"I think the ball is in the Angola government's court," she said. "I think a lot of what Unita does will be determined by what the Angolan government does and how reconciliatory they are."
Even if the leaders of the two sides can find their way to a common table, the loose organization of the rebel group will add yet another challenge to any peace effort, experts say. "The tough part is the people in the field," said a Western diplomat familiar with Angola. "They're hard to reach -- they're isolated. How to bring them in in a way that's safe is tricky."
So do not expect a swift end to the hostilities, Ms. de Beer said. "Instability can continue for some time," she said. "Several units could support the new leader, and some leaders could give themselves over. Other units may say that we'll continue as bandits.
"You could have a sort of Somalia situation where some forces stick to being Unita and some go out on their own. It may be some weeks before we really know what the situation is. Even if the new leader comes in with a reconciliatory attitude, it will take time to see whether everyone agrees with his approach."

Preserving the West's Wild Horses

BYLINE:  By VERLYN KLINKENBORG 

 BODY:
I remember watching, a few summers ago, a band of wild horses in the mountains above Lovell, Wyo. It was the first time I'd ever seen wild horses on open range. They came and went, grazing and bickering, always keeping a possible horizon in mind, just in case they wanted to gallop over it and out of human sight. I've looked at a lot of horses in my life, but I realized, as I stood on the slopes of Pryor Mountain, that this was the first time I'd ever seen them moving in the natural family groupings -- a stallion and a band of mares and foals -- that they would form in the wild. Domestication means breaking those bonds and thinking of horses as individuals. 
 The chance to see wild horses is nearly always accompanied by the chance to see just how bitterly contested their very existence is. Nearly everyone who comes near them is an advocate or an opponent or trying desperately to straddle the fence. The advocates range from practical horsemen and horsewomen to the farthest fringes of animal protection circles, people who wouldn't dream of training a horse, much less actually getting on its back and riding it. The people who resent the wild horse herds tend to be mostly one kind of people, ranchers who hold large leases of public land through the Bureau of Land Management. 
 As for the B.L.M. itself, it has tried unsuccessfully to accommodate both sides. For years it has conducted wild-horse roundups, intended to keep populations at a level acceptable to ranchers. Those roundups have nearly always been controversial, both because they can be brutal to the animals and because the bureau's wild-horse adoption program is, at best, a mixed success. Frankly, the public has a hard time making sense of a truly tame horse, much less a horse that has been raised without any knowledge of people whatsoever. Most Americans cannot really imagine just how wild a wild horse is.
The old rationale at the Bureau of Land Management was to keep wild-horse populations stable. But the new plan is to cut them in half, from some 46,000 animals to 24,000. Some ranchers complain that the horses are hard on water sources and fences and native vegetation. Some complain that these are animals that no one who knows horses would buy anyway. All these arguments boil down to the fact that nobody really makes money from wild horses. Unlike elk, they can't be hunted for sport, and they're too remote for tourism.
It would be one thing if this were private land in question, though even private owners don't have the right to destroy wild populations of animals that interfere with their economic interests. But wild horses live, overwhelmingly, on B.L.M. land, in Nevada, Utah, Arizona, Wyoming, Montana and Oregon. Ranchers hold low-cost leases on this land, but it is public land, and the public deserves some say in how these horses are managed.
Domesticated animals are invariably owned animals, and there is something startling to many people about seeing herds of unowned horses, something that makes it hard to think of them as truly "wild." "Wild" is a word that also implies "native," and these horses, as most people know, were not native to America. But many of them do bear the distinct bloodlines, and the appearance, of their Spanish forebears, which were first landed on this continent in the 16th century. Some of these animals more closely resemble those ancestors than they do contemporary Spanish horses. And whether they're native or not, the West that Americans found when they pushed westward in the 19th century was a territory filled with wild horses. They are as emblematic of that time and place as bison are. They inhabit now only the wildest corners of the West, where room should still be made for them.

HEADLINE: Home Resales Increased by 16% in January 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 25 

 BODY:
Sales of previously owned houses rose more than expected in January, to a record pace, an industry group said today, indicating that housing was likely to contribute to an economic rebound.
 Home resales increased 16.2 percent, to an annual pace of 6.04 million, from a 5.2 million unit pace in December, the trade group, the National Association of Realtors, said. 
 Housing sales typically spur the economy by prompting new owners to buy furniture and appliances and start home improvement projects. 
"People are spending money for remodeling as well as buying homes, and both of those are very strong indicators for the economy," said Bill Neary, president of the Maryland Association of Realtors and an agent in St. Michaels, Md.
Houses are affordable in part because 30-year fixed mortgage rates are close to the lowest level in the three decades that Freddie Mac, the No. 2 buyer of mortgages in the United States, has been keeping records. January sales may also have been buoyed by relatively warm weather.
The pace of January home resales exceeded the previous record of an annual 5.49 million last August. Resales are projected to total 5.2 million this year, which would make 2002 the third best on record, according to the real estate group. A record 5.3 million previously owned homes were sold last year.
The nationwide median price of a previously owned home fell to $151,100 last month from $153,100 in December. The supply of homes available for sale, another gauge of housing demand, fell to 4.1 months' worth in January, from 4.2 months' worth.
The rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 7 percent in January, down from 7.07 percent the previous month, according to Freddie Mac.
In November, the 30-year rate dropped to 6.45 percent, the lowest since 1972, when the company's record-keeping began. This month, mortgage rates have resumed a decline, with 30-year mortgages most recently at 6.81 percent.

HEADLINE: Head of Refugee Group Picked As President of Lincoln Center 

BYLINE:  By ROBIN POGREBIN 

 BODY:
A search committee of Lincoln Center executives has recommended Reynold Levy, president of the International Rescue Committee, as the next president of Lincoln Center.
 A special meeting of the full board has been called for Thursday, when Mr. Levy is expected to be approved. Mr. Levy and Beverly Sills, the chairwoman of Lincoln Center, confirmed the recommendation but said they would not comment further until after the meeting on Thursday. 
 If the board votes to accept Mr. Levy, he will take on the fairly monumental task of redeveloping Lincoln Center at a time when the city is focused on downtown development and the weak economy makes fund-raising potentially more difficult. Not only will Mr. Levy have to help raise the $1.2 billion that the project is expected to cost, but he will have to try to unite Lincoln Center's 13 arts groups behind the effort -- a task that has so far proven difficult.
Mr. Levy's expected appointment as president -- a job that has commanded a salary of more than $500,000 a year -- also raises questions about Ms. Sills's tenure. The 72-year-old former opera singer has said she will step down when a new president is installed, which would require yet another search for her replacement.
Lincoln Center's last president, Gordon J. Davis, stepped down in September after only nine months in the job because of what many said were tensions between him and Ms. Sills. The other leading candidate for the president's post, Joseph W. Polisi, president of the Juilliard School, has withdrawn from consideration, several say because he wanted the question of Ms. Sills's successor resolved. 
Since May 1997, Mr. Levy, 57, has been head of the International Rescue Committee, one of the world's largest refugee organizations which spends about $160 million a year providing services to refugees in 30 countries and 17 American cities.
Under Mr. Levy, the organization has become involved in such areas as Kosovo, Rwanda, Ethiopia and Uganda. He had already planned to step down and will be succeeded by George Rupp, the president of Columbia University, at the end of this academic year.
"Rarely has virtue, virtuosity and wit been combined in one person as it is in Reynold," said Bart Friedman, a senior partner at the law firm Cahill Gordon & Reindel who grew up in Brooklyn with Mr. Levy. 
Mr. Levy's experience with the arts has been mainly through two institutions, the AT&T Foundation and the 92nd Street Y. Before joining the rescue committee, Mr. Levy spent 12 years as a senior officer of AT&T in charge of government relations and as president of the AT&T Foundation, which supports many performing and visual arts programs. From 1977 to 1984, Mr. Levy was executive director of the 92nd Street Y on the Upper East Side. Under Mr. Levy, the Y expanded its cultural offerings, including founding the New York Chamber Symphony, conducted by Gerard Schwarz, and the American Jewish Theater.
In addition, Mr. Levy has served on arts boards, including the Roundabout Theater Company, the Manhattan Theater Club and the Municipal Art Society of New York. And he has testified before committees of Congress on federal arts policy as well as humanitarian issues.
A graduate of Hobart College, Mr. Levy holds a law degree from Columbia University and a Ph.D. in government and foreign affairs from the University of Virginia. He is also a senior lecturer at the Harvard Business School, where he teaches a course on leadership and several senior executive continuing education classes. His book "Give and Take: A Candid Account of Corporate Philanthropy," was published by Harvard Business School Press in 1999.
Mr. Levy is married to Elizabeth Cooke, the former executive director of the Parks Council of New York and the former president of the Bronx Museum of the Arts. They have two grown children, Emily and Justin.

HEADLINE: State Restricts Data on Internet In Attempt to Thwart Terrorists 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Feb. 25 

 BODY:
The Pataki administration has quietly ordered state agencies to restrict information available on the Internet and limit its release through New York's Freedom of Information Law to prevent terrorists from using the material, which includes maps of electrical grids and reservoirs as well as building floor plans.
 The new policy, laid out in a confidential memorandum to agency heads from the state's director of public security, James K. Kallstrom, is one of the most far-reaching and restrictive in the nation, according to research librarians and advocates for open government. 
 Mr. Kallstrom, a former high-ranking official of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, said the order was aimed at preventing details about potential targets, like bridges and nuclear power plants, from falling into the hands of terrorist groups like Al Qaeda.
"The intent, clearly, is to remove from the public Web sites that information that serves no other purpose than to equip potential terrorists," Mr. Kallstrom said. "This is not an attempt just to shield legitimate information from the public." 
Some state agencies had removed material in the immediate aftermath of the World Trade Center attack. But in the memorandum Mr. Kallstrom issued last month, he said the Pataki administration was concerned "that there is a disconcerting amount of potentially compromising information still publicly accessible."
The agency commissioners were not only instructed to review again what might be accessible, but were also asked to classify as "sensitive" and make exempt "information related to systems, structures, individuals and services essential to the security, government or economy of the state." He directed agency heads to remove things like data about electrical power, gas and oil storage, transportation, banking and finance, water supply, emergency services and the continuity of government operations. 
The state's new policy guidelines to restrict information and tighten security are occurring in lock step with the national debate over how to balance the need for safety and the public's right to information. 
While acknowledging the need for protections against terrorism, Donna Lieberman, the executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said the Pataki administration's new policy "raises serious concerns about the future of open government" and would allow, in the worst case, the government to become "a series of secret operations."
Federal officials have removed information, like the operational status of nuclear plants and certain maps of the nation's infrastructure, that was once at the fingertips of anyone with a computer.
The Environmental Protection Agency, for example, has blocked access to the toxic-release inventory, a listing of all factories and other sources that emit poisonous pollution, and has taken information about dangerous pesticides off its site, environmentalists say.
Some other states have also taken action to limit the free flow of information. Florida, for instance, has stopped posting records of drivers' licenses on the state Web sites.
In New York, the Public Service Commission stopped posting the locations of power plants, including nuclear reactors. The state's Energy Department erased a detailed map of power lines and substations from its site. Directions to stockpiles of water pumps and generators used by the state's Emergency Management Office during floods or other disasters are gone from the Internet. So are the locations of wastewater treatment plants, floor maps of state buildings and some mapping databases used to analyze everything from demographics to infrastructure.
A spokeswoman for Governor Pataki said the administration was still writing more concrete guidelines on what information would be classified and no longer available. "It's a work in progress," said Mollie Fullington, the spokeswoman. "We are putting together a team to review these very issues."
Some advocates of open government contended that New York's new rules were too broad and could cover information -- like the locations of chemical factories that emit toxic pollution -- that fuels debates at the core of modern democracy.
"No one would argue that the Pataki administration has been transparent," said Blair Horner, the chief lobbyist for the New York Public Interest Research Group. "I think there is a real danger that this directive could be used to further block from public view information the public should have access to. The decision on what should be on the Internet or not on the Internet should be a public discussion, not a private edict." 
Robert J. Freeman, the executive director of the State Committee on Open Government, said the Freedom of Information Law in New York State allows officials to censor some information if releasing it would endanger people's lives or compromise criminal investigations.
The administration's new directive to block the release of what it deems sensitive information to people who file requests under the law could easily be justified under those rules, he said. "All they are saying is be careful, be wise," Mr. Freeman said. "All the memo says is comply with the law." 
Ms. Fullington, the governor's spokeswoman, said such requests would be determined in the future on a "case-by-case basis."
Mr. Kallstrom's directive also ordered agency heads to review requests made under the state's Freedom of Information Law over the last year to determine if anyone had requested information that might be useful to terrorists. The purpose, he said, was to find leads for investigators trying to thwart terrorist plots.
"We are concerned that terrorism -- a very serious issue -- doesn't get used to take away information from the public," said Rachel Leon, a lobbyist for Common Cause. "You have to have a balance between security and the public's right to information. We have to make sure the government doesn't overstep."
Mr. Kallstrom says his directives are not intended to keep the public in the dark on policy matters. He said the diameter and location of a suspension bridge's cables and fasteners, for instance, should not be made public. Neither should details be available about the fencing and gates around nuclear plants or the access roads leading to water reservoirs.
One example of the new policy is that fuel delivery schedules and the locations of fuel storage tanks used by state agencies are no longer posted on the Web, aides to Mr. Pataki said. Nor are many details about the state's National Guard posts and units available.
The memorandum also directs agencies to set up security systems using passwords and other devices to protect the information they deem sensitive. Mr. Kallstrom has also led an effort to improve defenses against computer hackers, offering agencies help in constructing stronger fire walls against intruders.
As a practical matter, winnowing the information available on the Internet will force more people to request documents under the Freedom of Information Law, state officials said. Since the law requires a written request, a paper trail would be created for any release of information, making it easier for law enforcement officials to find out who had sought the documents. 
New York's open-records law does not require public information to be posted on the Internet, though some bills have been circulating in the State Legislature that would do just that. Other laws require that campaign contributions, payments to lobbyists and information about doctors be published on the Internet.
Experts on Internet security say the state's crackdown on information may not be immediately effective. Once something has been published on the Web, it is hard to control who copies it or where those copies end up. Some search engines save information from old Web sites, for instance, so a terrorist might still be able to find a map of New York's power grid.
"It's a bit of a horse out of the barn," Mr. Kallstrom acknowledged. "But you have to start somewhere. We don't want to unnecessarily and stupidly aid people who want to kill us."

HEADLINE: Temporary Memorials at Ground Zero 

 BODY:
As Sept. 11 recedes for the rest of the world, New Yorkers need a temporary memorial to those who died in the World Trade Center towers. A permanent structure as part of the redevelopment of ground zero is years of planning and debate away. In the meantime, the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation and several nonprofit arts groups are considering two interim memorials that deserve serious and swift consideration. 
 Using an idea that emerged shortly after the towers collapsed, the Municipal Art Society is among those pushing for two huge beams of light that would fill the voids in Manhattan's night skyline. The development corporation also proposes a site on the ground, using as its focal point what remains of the Fritz Koenig sculpture called "The Sphere" that once stood in the trade center plaza. 
 The Koenig sculpture -- a globe often said to represent world peace through trade -- is no longer round. The 27-foot bronze piece has been warped and dented, its damage a powerful statement to the forces that destroyed two 110-story towers and took the lives of more than 2,800 people. The development corporation plans to ask the advisory group representing families of victims to approve the interim plan. The family advisory group will choose among several downtown sites for the sculpture's temporary resting place. Their voice will, of course, be crucial, just as the city still needs to give final approval to the towers of light. But those agreements should start the course of redevelopment in a spirit of openness and cooperation, by providing for the needs not only of the families but for the rest of the city as well.
The temporary memorials can help all New Yorkers reflect on the losses of Sept. 11, just as temporary billboards, with fraying photographs of the missing, still bring back the aftermath of that terrible morning. The two beams of light can stand like beacons to the revival of Lower Manhattan. From the viewing platforms at ground zero, a temporary memorial can focus the eye -- not on an area that increasingly looks like a construction site -- but on a work of art, its form distorted by the very event to be remembered. While the city decides how to rebuild downtown, these two memorials can fill the long interim.

HEADLINE: 5 Bankers Fired From Barclays Over $62,700 Spent at Meal 

BYLINE:  By SUZANNE KAPNER 

DATELINE: LONDON, Feb. 25 

 BODY:
Perhaps it was the bottle of 1947 Chateau Petrus for $:12,300 ($17,500). Or maybe it was the 1945 vintage from the same vineyard for $:11,600 ($16,500). During dinner at a fashionable restaurant here, six investment bankers lapped up $:44,000 ($62,700) in fine wines, and now they are suffering from a huge hangover.
 Their employer, Barclays Capital, has fired all but one of the bankers since the dinner last July at Petrus, a restaurant in London named for the vineyards that produced the wine. 
 Initially the bankers, who paid the bill with their own money, received only a slap on the wrist for having spent so lavishly -- and having been documented doing so in newspapers at the time -- while Barclays, like other banks here, was trying to project a new sobriety as an antidote to the excesses of the 1990's.
But when some of the bankers secretly tried to pass off their part of the bill as client expenses, Barclays began firing them one by one. The firings were reported on Sunday in newspapers here.
Even by the standards of the last decade, such a bar bill would have been considered shocking, bankers in London said. But given the stark backdrop of shrinking fees and mounting layoffs, running up such a bill was brazen, they said.
"Even by New York standards, it's extravagant," said a banker, who has worked in London and New York but declined to be named for fear of joining his peers in unemployment.
The extravagance occurred as banks were instituting what some complain are draconian measures, requiring employees to fly economy class on business trips and limiting the amount spent on entertaining clients -- sometimes to as little as $:100 a person, or $140 -- as business suffers one of its worst slumps in two decades.
More layoffs are expected. Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank are among the major banks considering additional cuts, people close to the companies said today. That would be in addition to some 40,000 banking jobs that have been eliminated worldwide since the economy started to soften a year ago.
Global mergers and acquisitions are down sharply, with 2,879 announced deals so far this year, worth a total of $119 billion. That compares with 4,992 announced deals for $267 billion in the first two months of 2001, according to Thomson Financial. The slowdown is particularly sharp in the United States, which has had 754 announced deals in the first two months of the year, about half the average number for the period in the last half of the 1990's.
Initial offerings also have stagnated, with banks underwriting just nine share sales in the United States in the first two months of 2002, compared with 81 in the same period of 1996.
"It's bleak and getting bleaker," said Richard Peterson, a market strategist with Thomson Financial.
The bond market has done well, as companies, finding it difficult to entice investors to buy more stock, seek other ways to raise money. But the fees collected by investment banks for corporate bond deals tend to be lower than for stock sales, Mr. Peterson said.
None of these concerns apparently crossed the minds of the Barclays bankers, most of whom worked in equity derivatives, as they sat down last summer to celebrate a deal.
The party comprised Dayanandra Kumar, Mahish Chandra and Iftikhar Hyder from the London office; Ruth Cove from the bank's office in New York and two others who have not been identified. Mr. Hyder, who was relatively new to the bank and who told his superiors about the dinner almost immediately, was the only one to retain his job. None of the bankers could be reached for comment. Barclays declined to discuss the matter.
The setting was certainly regal. Petrus, one of London's most expensive restaurants, is backed by Gordon Ramsay, a celebrity chef who is a silent partner. The chocolate-colored walls offset by a burgundy-colored carpet and matching plush chairs give the feeling of sitting in a giant glass of very expensive brandy. Across from the marble-topped bar, also of a deep chocolate color, there is a fossil of an ammonite, a spiral-shaped shellfish that lived in the Cretaceous period 65 million years ago.
Gourmets willing to spend $:50 for three courses can tuck into the cooking of Marcus Wareing, including sauteed medallion of stuffed confit pig trotter or roast breast of Anjou pigeon on a parsnip galette.
But the food was very much a sideshow to this particular dinner, which also included a third Chateau Petrus, this one a 1946 vintage for $:9,400. Then there was a 1984 Montrachet for $:1,400, two bottles of Kronenbourg beer at $:3.50 each, six glasses of Champagne for $:9.50 each, one juice at $:3, 10 bottles of water totaling $:35, a pack of cigarettes for $:5 and, to wash it all down, a bottle of 100-year-old Chateau d'Yquem dessert wine for $:9,200.
The proprietor was so impressed that he did not charge for the food, and the restaurant has kept the bill ever since as a sort of memento. Given the new sobriety of London's financial crowd, it is unlikely Petrus will see another one like it for some time.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 8, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Feb. 26 about five investment bankers who were fired by Barclays Capital after they took part in an expensive dinner and wine party in a London restaurant misstated the reason for their dismissal. (An editorial on Feb. 27 repeated the error.) None of the bankers tried to pass off part of the dinner bill as client expenses. Barclays now refuses to say why they were dismissed or otherwise comment on the matter.

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Asia: Japan: Trade Surplus Expands 

BYLINE:  By Ken Belson (NYT) 

 BODY:
 Japan's trade surplus expanded in January, the first rise in 19 months, as imports fell by more than 9 percent. 
The surplus was 188 billion yen ($1.4 billion), reversing a deficit of 96 billion yen a year earlier. Exports also fell, but the decline, 1.8 percent, was the smallest in 10 months, reflecting improved demand for automobiles in response to the weakened value of the yen. The surplus with the United States rose 14.9 percent, with vehicle exports surging nearly 30 percent. Ken Belson (NYT)

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place; 
What's Good For the Country Is Good for G.M.

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 25 

 BODY:
General Motors, citing a stronger-than-expected outlook for domestic auto sales, raised its estimate for first-quarter earnings today, increased production and set an aggressive profit goal for the middle of the decade.
 "Over all, we're feeling reasonably good about where this market is and where we are," said John Devine, the chief financial officer at G.M., the world's largest automaker. "Certainly on the product side, we're beginning to get some momentum for the first time in some time." 
 Wall Street greeted the news as a further sign of G.M.'s budding transformation from one of the auto industry's more unpalatable investments to the pick of the Big Three. An improving outlook for auto sales is also good news for the economy. Shares of G.M. rose $2.37, or 4.5 percent, to $55.48, helping propel blue-chip stocks. 
The company also released details of its off-balance-sheet activities in an effort to be more transparent and head off the financial concerns that other companies have faced since the Enron bankruptcy. In a securities filing, G.M. said none of its officers, directors or workers held any interest in its off-balance-sheet entities. Such ties have been a leading concern that lawmakers and regulators have raised about Enron.
"They disclosed that because people have a case of the Enron jitters," said David Healy, an analyst at Burnham Securities, who added that these issues were not a particular concern regarding G.M. 
In recent months, G.M. sales have been growing, and its market share has not been sliding, an achievement in a market where the momentum has been in the hands of foreign automakers like Toyota and Honda. G.M. has also been helped by the struggles of its chief competitors, Ford Motor and the Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler. 
Last year, G.M. was the only one among the Big Three to post a profit, and it has maintained momentum this year. Last week, two analysts, Saul Rubin of UBS Warburg and Ron Tadross of Banc of America, upgraded the company to a buy rating. In the second half of last year, money-management giants like Fidelity Investments were moving money out of Ford and into G.M.
But G.M. officials said today that their confidence reflected improving industry conditions more than competitive trends. The company raised its projection for 2002 sales of passenger vehicles to 15.7 million from about 15 million. 
"Today's guidance has more to do with the overall industry, the overall economic environment, than the relative game," said Eric A. Feldstein, G.M.'s treasurer and vice president for finance. 
Driven by higher sales expectations, G.M. also increased its first-quarter earnings projection to $1.20 a share from $1 a share and its 2002 estimate to $3.50 a share from $3 a share. Executives also said they would produce 100,000 more cars and trucks this year than had previously been announced, a 2 percent increase. 
They were also preparing a $2.5 billion convertible bond offering as part of an effort to increase G.M.'s cash by $10 billion this year, including the more than $4 billion expected from the sale of Hughes Electronics. 
Some analysts were surprised that Mr. Devine said in a conference call that G.M. intended to earn $10 a share by the middle of the decade, a forecast that puts pressure on management to sustain its short-term success. G.M. did have earnings in that range in 1999 -- $9.18 a share -- but had a net profit of $601 million, or $1.77 a share, last year.
"It surprised me that he put himself on the line with the prediction," said Efraim Levy, an analyst at Standard & Poor's.
Skeptics remain. G.M. has considerable pension and health care burdens because its domestic market share has been cut in half since the early 1960's, leaving it with about 2.5 retirees for each active worker in the United States. And the interest-free financing deals it offered at the end of last year helped revive its sales but ate at profits. In addition, the company faces a potential battle with the United Automobile Workers in its drive to make its plants more efficient and eliminate jobs.
Mr. Levy upgraded his rating today, but to hold from avoid.
"The stock has run up recently, and there is still a competitive market," he said, "but they do have momentum going for them."
One additional hurdle for G.M. is the possibility of more stringent fuel- economy standards, now being debated in the Senate. G.M., along with the U.A.W., organized rallies of its workers today at plants in Pontiac, Mich.; Janesville, Wis.; and Toledo, Ohio, against the tougher fuel standards being considered. 
A proposal, put forth by Senate Democrats, would raise corporate average fuel-economy standards about 50 percent by 2013. The standards have not been significantly raised since the 1980's.
G.M. officials said the proposal, if adopted, would be "devastating" for domestic automakers, who depend heavily on sales of pickups and sport utility vehicles.
"No pickup, van or S.U.V. G.M. builds today could survive the higher requirements," said Guy Briggs, a G.M. vice president and general manager for vehicle manufacturing. 
"It could be the end of the family vehicle as we know it," he added. 
Environmentalists have contended that the goals are achievable and that domestic automakers made similar arguments when federal fuel economy standards were introduced in the 1970's.

HEADLINE: The Power Perplex 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Until recently, it seemed unlikely that California would ever get anything back from the energy companies that, in the view of state officials, robbed the state of billions of dollars. Then came the Enron scandal. Will revelations about Enron's political machinations, and new allegations by former Enron employees that the company manipulated California's electricity markets, change the odds?
 California officials apparently think so. Yesterday they filed a suit with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, seeking a renegotiation of electricity contracts signed during the state's power crisis. They may hope that FERC officials -- particularly the chairman, Pat Wood, who was recommended for the post by Enron's Ken Lay -- will feel the need to demonstrate their independence by getting tough with energy companies. 
 The contracts in question were signed about a year ago, when wholesale electricity prices in California were more than 10 times normal levels. Last June, however, prices suddenly plunged. Now the state wants those contracts canceled. 
Does the state have a case? The conventional wisdom is that California has only itself to blame for its power crisis, that the debacle was the result of "flawed deregulation." This conventional wisdom has become conventional mainly because it fits so well with our era's enduring faith in markets. (And I mean faith: "I believe in God and I believe in free markets," Mr. Lay once declared.)
But try asking what "flawed deregulation" means, and you usually get a long pause. Eventually you hear that wholesale prices were deregulated, but retail prices weren't -- which is true, but doesn't have much to do with what went wrong.
The key fact about California's crisis is that it peaked not in summer, when air-conditioners gobble electricity, but in the cooler months. Supplies should have been ample. Instead, there were severe shortages, because for some reason a third of the state's capacity stayed off line. 
The power companies say that generators were shut down for maintenance after being worked hard the previous summer. But the mysterious shutdowns went on for about six months, and continued despite sky-high prices for electricity. Surely there was time and incentive enough to carry out some expedited repairs.
A more likely explanation -- widely accepted by energy economists -- is that power companies found that they could make more money by shutting down some of their plants, and hence creating shortages that sent prices into the stratosphere, than they could by actually meeting demand.
If conventional wisdom was right, the crisis should have gotten even worse last summer. Instead, electricity suddenly became abundant, and prices plunged. Frank Wolak, the Stanford professor who heads California's electricity market surveillance committee, has explained why: by June, thanks in part to energetic conservation, most of the state's power needs were being supplied under those long-term contracts. The spot market, which was so easy to manipulate, had become relatively small; so the incentive for power companies to drive up spot prices by taking generators off line had largely vanished. Lo and behold, idle capacity came back on line, and the crisis was over. 
Now the truth is that California's deregulation probably was flawed, but the flaw was in trusting markets too much, not too little. As Mr. Wolak points out, California's system differed from other deregulations mainly in offering remarkably few safeguards against market manipulation. And the state paid an enormous price for its gullibility.
Will California win its suit? I have my doubts: money still talks. But at least the post-Enron change in climate makes it possible to revisit California's crisis, a crisis that should have provoked a rethinking of our economic ideology, before the ideologues flush it down the memory hole.
My Feb. 22 column mentioned "line 47" in this year's 1040. What I said was correct, but has been subject to misinterpretation, most of it innocent, some of it deliberate. Let me say it another way: Most people think that they received both a rebate and a tax cut. But the rebate was only an advance on the tax cut; it must be counted against the refund you would otherwise receive. Hundreds of thousands of early filers have already gotten this wrong. The effect is to give many people a rude shock, which is not what this economy needs.

Former Enron Treasurer Said to Cooperate in Inquiry
A senior official from Enron's finance division, himself a subject of the criminal inquiry into the company's collapse, has begun cooperating with federal officials, people who have been briefed on the situation said.
 Ben F. Glisan Jr., Enron's former treasurer, who played a central role in the establishment and operation of a byzantine series of affiliated partnerships, has offered information and evidence to both criminal and regulatory investigators, these people said. Government officials are said to consider Mr. Glisan a key participant in the demise of Enron. Page A1. 

A partnership managed by Andrew S. Fastow, the former chief financial officer of Enron, bet money on a deal that did not turn out well, then returned the investment to Enron. C7.

End of Terrorism Coverage Sought
Maurice R. Greenberg, the chief executive of the American International Group and a strong advocate of government help in providing general terrorism coverage, urged Washington to abandon the business of providing terrorism coverage for United States airlines for damage on the ground. Mr. Greenberg said his company and other private insurers, which refused to sell the coverage after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, were now willing to do so. C8.

Short Retirement for Odeen of TRW
About a week after Philip A. Odeen was brought out of retirement to be the nonexecutive chairman of TRW, Northrop Grumman made a $5.9 billion offer for TRW. Now he is in the middle of a takeover battle. C4.

2 Banks Cooperating in Allfirst Case
Citibank and Bank of America, which have special trading agreements with the currency trader for Allfirst Financial in Baltimore who lost $691 billion, said they were cooperating with the investigation. In addition, government investigators have subpoenaed records connected to their transactions and communications with the trader, John M. Rusnak. C4.

An Effort to Save a Cancer Drug
ImClone and Bristol-Myers Squibb have begun a last-ditch effort to salvage their application for approval of the cancer drug Erbitux, which the Food and Drug Administration declined to even review in December. The companies will meet with the F.D.A. today. C2.

G.M. and Lowe's Push Shares Up
Stocks rallied after G.M. and Lowe's said business was picking up. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 177.56 points, or 1.8 percent, to 10,145.71. The Nasdaq composite index jumped 45.34 points, or 2.6 percent, to 1,769.88. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 19.59 points, or 1.8 percent, to 1,109.43. C10.

Home Resales Rose 16% in January
Home resales increased 16.2 percent, to an annual pace of 6.04 million, from a 5.2 million unit pace in December, the trade group, the National Association of Realtors said. The robust growth indicates that housing will probably contribute to an economic rebound. The pace of January resales exceeded the record of an annual 5.49 million last August. C10.

Williams Spinoff Considers Options
Williams Communications, the troubled broadband network services provider, said it was looking to restructure its outstanding debt obligations and that it might seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from its creditors. C9.

HEADLINE: ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: ACCOUNTING; 
As Andersen's Overseer, Volcker Won't Settle for Nominal Change

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN D. GLATER 

 BODY:
Arthur Andersen, the embattled accounting firm, is likely to undergo a profound overhaul at the hands of Paul A. Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman who was recently named to head a special oversight board at the firm.
 Mr. Volcker -- who has sweeping power to order changes at Andersen -- is considering tighter controls throughout the firm, according to people who have talked with him. 
 He plans, for example, to examine the process for reviewing decisions about the accounting treatment of complex transactions, like those Enron engaged in with its off-balance-sheet partnerships, these people said. 
Mr. Volcker will also consider having more of Andersen's top executives, now spread among its far-flung offices, work in one place.
Andersen hired Mr. Volcker, 74, this month, as the firm set out to confront client defections, low staff morale and the damage to its reputation from a series of controversial audits, culminating in its dealings with Enron.
Mr. Volcker declined to be quoted about his plans at Andersen. But some hints were evident in his recent testimony before the Senate Banking Committee.
He told the panel that more than new legislation and regulation is necessary to improve the reliability of corporate audits -- accounting firms, he said, must change their priorities and attitudes to put more emphasis on ethics and on the quality of the audits.
"You can't just pass a law," Mr. Volcker said, adding, "You've got to have internal procedures."
He is therefore almost certain to focus closely on how Andersen supervises its auditors, according to the people who have talked with him. A likely starting point would be a careful review of the firm's procedures for reviewing difficult accounting questions. It is not yet clear, for instance, whether the accounting for Enron's deals was approved by senior partners outside Andersen's Houston office, which handled the Enron account.
Industry analysts say Andersen is already one of the better coordinated of the Big Five accounting firms, but its structure is diffuse as a result of its worldwide operations. While its headquarters are in Chicago, few of the senior executives responsible for United States operations are based there. Joseph F. Berardino, the chief executive, spends most of his time in New York.
Mr. Volcker may try to change that structure -- tightening the links in Andersen's chain of command, bringing more senior executives to one location and relying less on conference calls and e-mail messages to keep everyone in touch, according to the people who have spoken with him. 
For Andersen, such a move would be a marked change in strategy, said Arthur W. Bowman, editor of Bowman's Accounting Report. Other Big Five firms have tried to emulate Andersen's dispersed structure, he said, so that they can more easily move their resources around the world. Andersen's United States operations are more closely tied to its overseas business than at most other firms, he said.
In his Congressional testimony, Mr. Volcker also discussed his concerns about potential conflicts of interest confronting auditors who sell other services to clients. While Andersen has indicated that it will cease selling some technology consulting services to companies it audits, it plans to continue to offer other services, like tax advice. 
"When does it become something else which may conflict with auditing is one of the many subtle questions that arise here," Mr. Volcker said.
Mr. Volcker -- an economist by training, not an accountant -- is expected to consult with industry professionals, and other experts will be named to the oversight board. But from the outset, he has emphasized the authority he has been granted.
If the oversight board determines that particular executives should be dismissed, for example, the firm is obligated to comply, according to the language in his agreement with Andersen. The oversight board will also have the power to review "all necessary information" and to hire its own staff.
If Andersen executives balk, they would run the risk of having Mr. Volcker resign in protest.
Whatever steps he takes, if they are to help Andersen regain some portion of its stature, they will have to come soon. Since Jan. 1, the firm has been fired by at least 16 public companies -- including the Rural/ Metro Corporation, Commonwealth Bancorp and Northern Border Pipeline -- all of which have hired different auditors. No other auditor was rejected by as many clients, according to data collected by Audit Trak, a computer database from Strafford Publications in Atlanta. 
In that period, a total of 116 companies replaced their auditors, Audit Trak found. Among the Big Five accounting firms, 9 companies replaced PricewaterhouseCoopers; 9 replaced KPMG; 7 replaced Ernst & Young; and 6 replaced Deloitte & Touche, the American unit of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu. The other changes affected smaller accounting firms.
Andersen's efforts to carry on business as usual have also been hindered by continuing reports that it is desperately trying to settle shareholder suits against it for signing off on Enron's financial statements. At the end of last week, Andersen was negotiating with Enron creditors to head off lawsuits by Enron itself.
Some partners have left the firm recently, as well. One Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu office in Britain recently announced that three of Andersen's partners there would be switching. An Andersen spokesman said the departure of the three partners was unrelated to the firm's involvement with Enron. 
Executives at other firms say privately that they are receiving many resumes from Andersen accountants -- not just partners, but also midlevel employees concerned about the firm's future.
So concerned were Andersen's executives about employee morale that, in an effort to soften the effect of news articles expected to be critical, they distributed e-mail alerts to staff members before the accounts were published.

HEADLINE: College Tuition: Sky's the Limit 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 The tuition increases now being resorted to by American schools threaten to make college education even more difficult to pay for than it already is for those middle-class families that do not have access to the financial aid that poorer families may have (front page, Feb. 22). Robust cost-cutting is needed throughout higher education, including in the considerable amenities that students have come to expect. 
 One major mode of cost-cutting by schools is rarely relied upon these days: the substantial reduction of full-time faculty and administrative salaries until economic conditions improve. Some of this effect can also be secured by raising teaching loads.

HEADLINE: Climate Plan Is Criticized As a Risky Bet 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

 BODY:
The White House statement on climate change read: "President Bush announced today that the United States has agreed with other industrialized nations that stabilization of carbon dioxide emissions should be achieved as soon as possible. The United States also agreed that it is timely to investigate quantitative targets to limit or reduce carbon dioxide emissions."
 That was Nov. 7, 1989, one year after a global heat wave made the environment a top political issue and raised the prospect that people might be affecting the climate by adding carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases to the air, warming the planet as if it were inside a greenhouse. 
 Twelve years later, under a new President Bush, the urgency has evaporated. On Feb. 14 the president articulated a new approach to what has become a lingering, complicated, politically charged scientific issue. It relies on voluntary efforts to slow, but not halt, the growth in emissions of greenhouse gases. Progress is to be measured by tracking the growth of emissions relative to the growth of the economy. 
For nearly a year, the president has been saying there is no scientific justification for the specific emissions targets set forth in the Kyoto Protocol, the climate treaty that would require participating industrialized countries to cut emissions by 2012 below their level of 1990. The administration says that when it comes to carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, no one has yet determined how much is too much. 
But after analyzing details of Mr. Bush's new plan, many scientists and economists who study climate data and policy say the scientific ambiguity that the administration used to justify a limited response certainly exists, but cuts both ways.
"What people sometimes forget is that the uncertainty in the science is double-edged," said Dr. Ronald G. Prinn, the director of the department of earth, atmospheric and planetary sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
"In our own studies, we estimate about a chance in 20 that the warming in the next 100 years will exceed eight degrees Fahrenheit," he said. "There's no doubt in my mind that eight degrees is something to deeply worry about. The target set by the president's policy to me looks inadequate in the face of that risk."
Under the administration's plan, carbon dioxide emissions would rise about 14 percent over the next decade -- the same increase that took place over the last decade. "Can't we do maybe twice what we did in the last 10 years?" Dr. Prinn asked, suggesting that the White House should move more aggressively against emissions. "Then you'd have much more of a chance of real reductions."
Moreover, many climate experts said, rising productivity and energy efficiency have been slowing the growth of emissions compared with economic growth for more than a decade -- at the same pace Mr. Bush is proposing. Simply continuing this course, many said, is inadequate to promote the changes needed to flatten the curve of growth -- and eventually turn it downward.
The debate over the new plan should reach Capitol Hill this week, when the Senate is expected to consider an energy bill with contentious provisions on oil drilling, gas-mileage standards and other policies that may affect emissions rates.
Critics of the Bush approach include several members of a scientific committee assembled last year at the behest of the White House by the National Academy of Sciences to assess questions about climate change.
Dr. Ralph J. Cicerone, chairman of the academy panel and chancellor of the University of California at Irvine, said the Bush administration was mistaken to view uncertainty as a cause for comfort. 
He said there was no longer any ambiguity about whether humans were significant contributors to global warming, and he noted that in the opening line of its report to the White House, the panel stated plainly that "greenhouse gases are accumulating in Earth's atmosphere as a result of human activities, causing surface air temperatures and subsurface ocean temperatures to rise."
Last week, Dr. Cicerone said continued growth in emissions would make things worse. "This situation is not sustainable, and its trajectory is toward dangers," he said, adding that the White House proposal "lacks ambition and foresight" and "sets goals that are too timid."
The goals were far from modest when Mr. Bush's father signed the first climate treaty, in 1992. Under that treaty, industrialized nations agreed to strive to reduce their greenhouse emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000. Instead, however, global emissions continued to rise. American releases of greenhouse gases rose more than 12 percent in that period.
Last fall, most industrialized nations rallied around a new treaty, the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, though they have yet to ratify it. That treaty, which the Clinton administration had signed, would require participating industrialized countries to cut emissions by 2012 below where they stood in 1990. 
Mr. Bush rejected the Kyoto treaty last year, saying the emissions targets were not scientifically justified. He said that the treaty unfairly required no emissions cuts of fast-growing countries like China and that it would harm the American economy. 
Last week, Dr. Conrad C. Lautenbacher Jr., a mathematician and retired Navy vice admiral, who is the under secretary of commerce for oceans and atmosphere, said Mr. Bush's new plan struck a reasonable balance between economic and environmental concerns. "You're playing with a $12 trillion economy here," Dr. Lautenbacher said. "There's such a large connection with our economy based on what we do and to what degree we do it that we'd be foolish not to try to understand the basic processes better."
The new policy is also attracting support from scientists who are skeptical that global warming is a serious long-term threat. More aggressive moves, they say, would harm the economy and waste resources that could be used to solve other problems. Indeed, some skeptics say Mr. Bush's policy concedes too much by even acknowledging that voluntary changes are needed. 
"Voluntary has a nasty habit of turning mandatory," said S. Fred Singer, a climatologist, who has long criticized the consensus view on warming and who heads the Science and Environmental Policy Project, a research and advocacy group financed by private contributions.
Dr. Singer says recent studies have steadily whittled away at the direst predictions for warming. 
"Every bit of data," he said, "seems to confirm that the climate sensitivity is well below even the lowest value given" by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an international scientific group that has issued three assessments of climate science over the last 10 years. 
But the lead author of one of the new studies, Dr. James E. Hansen, the director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, says there is a difference between refining projections of change and saying global warming is not a serious problem. 
In a paper in a recent issue of The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Dr. Hansen and a Goddard colleague, Dr. Makiko Sato, plotted the changing concentrations of various greenhouse gases and predicted that the average global temperature would rise 1.3 degrees over the next 50 years. That is at the low end of predictions for warming generated by most computer models of climate, but more than temperatures rose over the last 100 years. 
The paper concluded that the warming trend was likely to be substantially slower than previously thought, given the slowing buildup of greenhouse gases other than carbon dioxide. For example, Dr. Hansen said, methane, a potent greenhouse gas that was once rapidly building in the atmosphere, has shown a sharp decline in its growth rate since 1980, for reasons scientists cannot explain.
The scientists also calculated that a concerted effort to raise fuel efficiency and find ways to remove carbon dioxide from the air could well cause emissions to stop growing altogether later in the century and, eventually, to decline.
But over all, Dr. Hansen said, the Goddard analysis still means that temperatures by 2050 will be more than two degrees warmer than they were at the beginning of the 20th century, when the accelerating Industrial Revolution began transforming vast stores of coal and oil into carbon dioxide.
"I could see keeping the warming relatively moderate, but I point out that even a two-degree warming is going to make the earth very warm compared to the history of the last millions of years," Dr. Hansen said. 
And, he noted, if emissions continue to rise just 1 percent a year -- the current rate, and the rate that would result under the policies proposed by Mr. Bush -- that adds up to a lot of greenhouse gases by later in the century.
Still, Dr. Hansen said he remained optimistic that societies would rise to the challenge, adding that natural evidence of a strong human contribution to global warming was likely to pile up in the next few years -- along with a consensus for more action to counter it. 
"We'll be seeing how things are going well before 10 years are out," Dr. Hansen said.

HEADLINE: Hot Seat, Hard Times; 
City's New Cultural Affairs Commissioner Settles In

BYLINE:  By ROBIN POGREBIN 

 BODY:
It is tough enough to take on the job of New York City cultural affairs commissioner just as Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has proposed cuts of 15 percent to the agency's expense budget and 20 percent to its capital budget.
 But Kate D. Levin also inherits a department many arts professionals describe as in need of serious reinvigoration. Even as Rudolph W. Giuliani poured an unprecedented amount of city money into cultural building projects and became known for his love of opera, the agency charged with promoting the interests of New York's arts institutions quietly but steadily diminished in size and influence amid years of budgetary ups and downs. 
 Since 1990, the staff of the Department of Cultural Affairs has shrunk to 33 people from 65. (It was at 47 when Mr. Giuliani took office.) The department has been receiving a declining share of money each year from the city budget, according to a recent report by the New York Foundation for the Arts, a nonprofit arts support group. Since 1988 this has cost the agency nearly $250 million in inflation-adjusted spending, the report says. 
"The agency requires significant strengthening to operate more effectively as an agent, catalyst and convener for a large and complex cultural economy," the report, a yearlong study of the city's cultural industry, concluded.
And while the cultural affairs department right now is mostly a conduit for money from the city, arts professionals say that it has the potential to be much more, that the commissioner could lead the charge in making the case for culture as a sound economic investment for both government and the private sector.
The new commissioner "has to figure out how she wants to articulate the role of culture in this city's life," said Mary Schmidt Campbell, who served as cultural affairs commissioner from 1987 to 1991. During the era of Mayor Edward I. Koch, for example, cultural affairs became a symbol that "this city is not going to die," Ms. Campbell said. When crack was rampant, Ms. Campbell continued, Mayor David N. Dinkins missed an opportunity to use cultural affairs as a way to say, "Here is the affirmative side of city life."
Norma P. Munn, chairwoman of the New York City Arts Coalition, a citywide arts advocacy group, and others say the commissioner must argue for culture as a financial engine. This was the theory that held the greatest sway with Mr. Giuliani, as Anthony P. Coles, the deputy mayor who oversaw cultural affairs under Mr. Giuliani, noted. "The mayor tended to look at the arts in large part as economic development -- what's it going to create in jobs and income back to the city?" he said. 
Will Ms. Levin be able to wield the same argument successfully? "Everybody's watching," Ms. Munn said.
In an interview at her office on West 42nd Street in Manhattan, Ms. Levin suggested that she knew the limitations she faced. "The cupboard is bare," she said. "There is only so much you can do. It will be my nonstop effort to see that the cultural community is made whole to the extent that it's possible."
Complicating matters, Ms. Levin comes to the post when arts institutions are still struggling with declines in attendance and a difficult fund-raising climate in the wake of Sept. 11. Many institutions report drops in ticket sales of 10 percent or more, and foundations offering emergency money to arts groups have been deluged with applications.
The commissioner's job will be made tougher by having to walk the line between building strong ties to the mayor and challenging him if necessary on behalf of cultural groups. Mr. Bloomberg, who has served on the boards of Lincoln Center and the Jewish Museum, among other cultural groups, has already said that Lincoln Center's $1.2 billion redevelopment and other major capital projects may have to be put off. Ms. Levin's predecessor, Schuyler G. Chapin, was widely criticized for doing too little too late in defense of the Brooklyn Museum of Art in its clash with Mr. Giuliani over the "Sensation" exhibition, which featured a black Madonna with elephant dung.
But Ms. Levin has been in city government before. She helped Diane M. Coffey, Mayor Koch's chief of staff, run the cultural affairs department on an interim basis when Bess Myerson stepped down as commissioner. And she has worked with Patricia Harris, Mr. Bloomberg's deputy mayor, who oversees cultural affairs as part of her portfolio. Ms. Harris was also assistant to Mayor Koch and executive director of the Art Commission of the City of New York.
Both Ms. Coffey and Ms. Harris were said to be instrumental in putting Ms. Levin forward for the job. Among the candidates Ms. Levin beat out were Laurie Tisch Sussman, chairwoman of the Center for Arts Education, and Stephanie French, formerly vice president for corporate contributions at Philip Morris.
Ms. Levin, 41, who grew up on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, is also a seasoned New Yorker who has moved in cultural and literary circles. Her father, Wilbur A. Levin, is the Kings County clerk. Her mother, Phyllis Lee Levin, is a writer. Her husband is the sculptor Mark di Suvero (they have a 7-year-old daughter), who started the Socrates Sculpture Park in Queens, where Ms. Levin served as a consultant.
With a magna cum laude degree from Harvard and a doctorate from the University of California at Berkeley, Ms. Levin spent the last six years teaching English Renaissance literature and theater history and directing 16th-century plays at the City College of New York. In 1997 she was appointed associate director of the Simon H. Rifkind Center for the Humanities at the college. Ms. Levin earned tenure last year and is currently on leave.
Before earning her Ph.D., Ms. Levin worked as an arts consultant for the Jim Henson Foundation and for the Brooklyn Academy of Music, where she also served as director of corporate relations and director of special projects. So she comes to the job knowing she has more than budget cuts to address, namely the distribution of money to the 34 organizations that make up the city's Cultural Institutions Group and to other nonprofit arts organizations. 
The organizations in the Cultural Institutions Group, which are owned by the city or on city land, are now guaranteed 85 percent of the cultural budget. The rest is distributed among what are known as the program groups, which include about 500 institutions, as large as the Museum of Modern Art and Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater and as small as the Pan Asian Repertory Theater in Manhattan and the Queens Historical Society. (Mr. Giuliani also established the Cultural Challenge Initiative, which distributes $5 million each year to several hundred arts groups that apply for financial help and have to raise matching private donations.)
Many program groups feel that the distribution of city money is inequitable, while supporters of the Cultural Institutions Group argue that tax money should go primarily to taxpayer-supported institutions. 
In her first public remarks since being named commissioner, Ms. Levin earlier this month described the city as an inconsistent partner for the program groups and said she hoped to steer more money toward them. "It troubles me that there is a kind of second-class-citizenship status," she said.
In addition, arts professionals say, the process by which grants are awarded is ad hoc, the criteria are unclear. Even Ms. Campbell, now dean of the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University, conceded that the system needs improvement. "If you try to find some logic or reasoning behind it you will go insane," she said. "In many ways it could be better. But I'm not sure how you would define fair."
Mr. Giuliani's cultural commissioner, Mr. Chapin, 78, helped change city policy so that the program groups could be eligible for money from the capital budget. He is also widely credited with adding a graceful, courteous mien to the agency and advocating on behalf of art in the schools. 
But his agency also lost clout with City Hall and saw its staff depleted in the Giuliani years. Some arts executives say that the mayor simply went around his Cultural Affairs Department to deal with arts groups directly and that his Office of Management and Budget really called the dollars-and-cents shots for the agency. Others say he gave the agency attention.
Mr. Chapin says he made a conscious decision to work quietly from within rather than to challenge the mayor. "I made up my mind that the best way to work with him was to stay off his radar screen," Mr. Chapin said. "I never tried to horn in on anything other than that which was necessary."
City officials say it has been a struggle for the agency to keep up with the workload. 
Ms. Harris suggested that Ms. Levin would have no trouble getting the ear of City Hall. "I can tell you," Ms. Harris said, "Kate will be very involved in this administration."
Those familiar with Ms. Levin's background and personality say she is prepared to seize the opportunity. "She understands the mission, which is to be the chief advocate for the arts in the city," said Ms. Coffey, now managing director at Peter J. Solomon Company, an investment banking firm, who served on Mr. Bloomberg's transition team. As Mayor Koch's chief of staff, Ms. Coffey made Ms. Levin her executive assistant from 1986 to 1989, and she described her recently as "absolutely brilliant." 
Perhaps the most important task for the new commissioner will be fighting to limit erosion of the cultural budget during the current economic hard times. Ms. Munn said that the last time the city's cultural organizations were significantly cut back was in 1992, and it took five to six years to recover.

HEADLINE: Bush's Plan on Welfare Law Increases Work Requirement 

BYLINE:  By ROBIN TONER and ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 25 

 BODY:
Opening what could be a rough, yearlong debate about welfare, President Bush is proposing to increase the work requirements for welfare recipients and push the states harder to meet them.
 The administration, which already unveiled part of its plan to overhaul the landmark 1996 welfare law, plans to announce its proposals on Tuesday. Mr. Bush told the nation's governors meeting here today that he would ask Congress to approve new work requirements but would also seek to give states the flexibility to meet the needs of people who need training or drug abuse treatment. 
 Still, Mr. Bush said, "work ought to be the core of welfare reform." 
In an excerpt from an advance text of his speech, Mr. Bush declares: "We are encouraged by the initial results of welfare reform, but we are not content. We ended welfare as we've known it, yet this is not a post-poverty America. Child poverty is still too high, too many families are strained and fragile and broken -- too many Americans still have not found work and the purpose it brings. Because these needs continue, our work is not done."
At least 50 percent of a state's welfare families must now participate in work and other activities aimed at self-sufficiency; Mr. Bush proposes to raise that requirement so that 70 percent must be working by 2007. Administration officials also said they hoped to close loopholes that render the work requirement, in some cases, largely meaningless.
The administration plans to require welfare recipients to work 40 hours a week "at a job or in programs designed to help them achieve independence." Adults are now generally required to work 30 hours a week, of which no more 10 could be in job training or education programs.
A fact sheet released by the administration tonight said that the plan would "make special accommodations for parents with infants and individuals who need substance abuse treatment, rehabilitation or special work-related training."
Gov. John Engler, the Michigan Republican who is chairman of the National Governors' Association, and Gov. Paul E. Patton, the Kentucky Democrat who is the group's vice chairman, said governors were generally pleased with what they learned about the plan, though details were tightly held until tonight.
But advocates for low-income people were already starting to mobilize against the plan.
"It's almost welfare reform in Wonderland," said Deepak Bhargava, director of the National Campaign for Jobs and Income Support, a group seeking to liberalize the welfare law. "We're in the middle of a recession. Now is a strange time to be arguing we ought to toughen work requirements on poor families."
Administration officials said the Bush plan would allow for creative combinations of job training, education and work. Increasing poor people's opportunities for training -- and thus moving up the economic ladder -- is a primary goal for Democrats and some Republicans on Capitol Hill this year.
Douglas J. Besharov, a welfare expert at the American Enterprise Institute, said combining tougher work requirements with more training possibilities permitted the administration "to go left and right at the same time."
Mr. Bush's proposals come as Congress begins to review the 1996 law, much of which expires this year. That law abolished entitlements for cash assistance for poor families, replacing them with block grants to states and new work requirements.
Mr. Bush plans to argue, aides said, that the 1996 law was an unalloyed success. He will also, aides said, try to refute the idea -- held by some welfare experts -- that the booming economy was the most important factor in the substantial drop in welfare cases in recent years.
The aides also said Mr. Bush considered welfare legislation a primary goal this year, and many analysts have suggested it may be one of the few major measures that could pass in this intensely political year.
In their fact sheet, Bush officials said they would seek to extend the existing five-year ban on federal welfare benefits for immigrants who entered the United States after 1996 and have not become citizens. 
The fact sheet also said the administration would direct "up to $300 million" for programs aimed at "encouraging healthy, stable marriages." That included a $100 million fund for experimental programs on marriage training at the state level that had been previously announced.
The administration indicated it would give states the "flexibility to streamline and coordinate" support programs like food stamps and child care that help poor families with the transition from welfare to work.
Though the law stipulates that half the adults on a state's welfare rolls be working, the requirement's significance has been eroded by another provision of the law. A state that has cut its welfare caseload since 1995 is given credit toward meeting the work requirement. In many states, the caseload has shrunk so much that they are no longer subject to a significant work requirement for those people remaining on welfare. Bush aides said they wanted Congress to impose more meaningful work requirements. 
This year, as in 1996, Republicans and moderate Democrats may find areas of agreement. Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana, chairman of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council, said: "Philosophically, the president is heading in the right direction. We need to make sure that the tools are there for people to meet the work requirements, and that states have some flexibility."
Mr. Bayh said he and Senator Thomas R. Carper, Democrat of Delaware, were writing a bill that would gradually raise work requirements. 
Representative Sander M. Levin of Michigan, a leading Democratic expert on welfare, said he could not evaluate Mr. Bush's proposal without more information, which the White House has yet to provide.
"The acceptability of the increase in work requirements will depend on whether states have adequate flexibility to combine work with the training necessary for people to move up the ladder and achieve financial security and independence," Mr. Levin said.

HEADLINE: Deputy Is Appointed to Direct Food and Drug Agency as Impasse Continues 

BYLINE:  By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 25 

 BODY:
After months of disagreement with Senate Democrats over a nominee to be commissioner of food and drugs, the Bush administration named a food safety expert today to run the Food and Drug Administration as deputy commissioner until a permanent chief was found.
 The appointment of Dr. Lester Crawford, director of a research institute affiliated with Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, effectively lets the administration install its own person at the agency without having to worry about Senate confirmation. 
 In the fall, Tommy G. Thompson, secretary for health and human services, discreetly circulated the name of Dr. Crawford, a veterinarian with a degree in pharmacology, at the Capitol, telling selected lawmakers that Dr. Crawford was his choice for commissioner. Mr. Thompson has been especially concerned about food safety, which is what drew him to Dr. Crawford, who has been administrator of the Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service in the Agriculture Department. 
The commissioner of food and drugs has traditionally been a medical doctor, and people familiar with the selection process said the White House might have preferred a physician for the agency's top job.
"Lester Crawford has devoted his career to promoting safer products for the public," Mr. Thompson said in announcing the appointment, "and he brings to the F.D.A. valuable experience and leadership skills. With his help, the F.D.A. will continue to build on its successes in ensuring the safety of foods, drugs and medical products for all Americans."
As Dr. Crawford begins work immediately, a spokesman for the health department, Bill Pierce, said the White House was "actively looking for an F.D.A. commissioner." 
The agency is a vast organization that regulates products that account for one-fourth of the American economy. Because it monitors food safety and approves new drugs and vaccines, it has taken a growing role in domestic security as the administration tries to improve defenses against bioterrorism.
Lawmakers and health experts have been saying it is critical for the White House to name someone as commissioner soon. Among them is Dr. Gail R. Wilensky, who ran the Health Care Financing Administration under President George Bush.
In an interview, Dr. Wilensky said today that Dr. Crawford's appointment "takes maybe a teeny bit of the pressure off." But, she added, "it does not take the place of having a duly confirmed political appointee."
The agency has lacked a commissioner since Mr. Bush took office. It has been run by a career employee, Dr. Bernard A. Schwetz. 
In seeking to fill the position, Mr. Bush has faced a quandary. If he names someone with close ties to the pharmaceutical industry, he angers Senate Democrats. If he names someone who lacks those ties, he angers industry executives.
Already, that tension has scuttled two candidates. Last week, the White House informed Dr. Alastair J. J. Wood, an expert on drug safety who had been widely considered the leading contender, that he did not have the position. Drug executives had objected to Dr. Wood, describing him as too aggressive a regulator.
Another candidate, Michael J. Astrue, a biotechnology lawyer, drew opposition from Senate Democrats, particularly Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, because of his industry ties.
Because he comes from academia, Dr. Crawford would appear to escape that criticism, although consumer advocates have argued that his institute, the Center for Food and Nutrition Policy, receives too much support from industry.
"His distance from industry is more semantic than real," Michael F. Jacobson, executive director of Center for Science in the Public Interest, an advocacy group, wrote to the White House when Dr. Crawford's name surfaced in the fall.

HEADLINE: A Sluggish Swiss Insurer Shifts Management a Bit 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH OLSON 

DATELINE: GENEVA, Feb. 25 

 BODY:
Rolf Huppi will resign as chief executive at Zurich Financial Services, which has had a 60 percent drop in its share price over a year, the company said today.
 But Mr. Huppi will remain chairman, the company said. No successor as chief executive has been named, meaning Mr. Huppi, 58, will continue to run the company at least through midyear. 
 The stock rose on the news, even though the announcement did not bring the sweeping changes many analysts say were necessary to resuscitate the fortunes of the 130-year-old insurance group.
"It's a glass-half-empty announcement," said Alain Kupferschmid, insurance analyst for the Darier Hentsch Bank. "The company really needs a big change in its operational side."
Mr. Huppi, who has worked at the company since he was a teenager and has been chief executive for 11 years and chairman for 7, had been under pressure to give up one of the posts. He survived a no-confidence vote at last year's shareholders' meeting, and he told a Swiss weekly last month that he had no plans to step down. But Zurich Financial issued four earnings warnings last year, and the sagging share price finally obliged him to give up day-to-day control of the company.
Further complicating Zurich Financial's situation was a request today from Swiss insurance authorities that the company explain its profit forecasts and give details of its financial condition. The regulators made the same request of Swiss Life, the country's largest insurer, which has also been hurt by difficult markets. Each company will now have to meet with the regulators before reporting results for 2001; Zurich Financial now plans to release its results on March 21.
The latest forecast, in December, was for a loss of $200 million to $400 million, mainly because of some $760 million in losses directly related to the Sept. 11 terror attacks and a $900 million write-down on its investment portfolio, hit hard by the global economic downturn. 
Earlier this month, Standard & Poor's lowered Zurich Financial's credit rating to AA-, because of concerns about flagging earnings, eroding capital and inconsistent management. For example, Mr. Huppi tried to increase profits by buying Scudder Investments, an American mutual fund company, and a financial services unit of British-American Tobacco, only to sell them again last year as earnings fell. The company also sold its reinsurance unit, renamed Converium Holding, raising some $2 billion.
Among major Swiss financial services firms here, only the Credit Suisse Group now combines both top posts in a single executive, Lukas Muhlemann. 
There is no clear successor to Mr. Huppi. Constantine Iordanou had been heir apparent, but he quit after five months as chief operating officer. For now, Peter Eckert has been named to oversee group operations and business development, beginning on March 1, the company said.
Another contender, James Schiro, will join the company that day as chief operating officer for group finance. He comes to Zurich Financial from PricewaterhouseCoopers. But analysts say Mr. Eckert's insurance experience gives him an inside track.

HEADLINE: ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: CORPORATE CULTURE; 
At Enron, Lavish Excess Often Came Before Success

BYLINE:  This story was reported by Neela Banerjee, David Barboza and Audrey Warren and was written by Ms. Banerjee. 

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Feb. 25 

 BODY:
For years, the Enron Corporation thrived on spending big, and even as late as October -- with warnings ringing loudly about its rickety finances -- no one at Enron saw any reason to change.
 The company had set aside $1.5 million for a Christmas party at Enron Field, Houston's sparkling new sports stadium, hoping to match the sumptuous gatherings of earlier years. Only in mid-November, when a ruined Enron was heading for bankruptcy and trying to sell itself to Dynegy, its crosstown rival, was the celebration finally called off. 
 Everything Enron did had to be better and flashier -- from the new business ventures it unveiled nearly every year to the way it celebrated Secretaries' Day with gifts of Waterford crystal -- and no gesture seemed too lavish, workers and competitors agree.
Extravagance, by itself, did not bring the company down. But the company's spending reflected a go-go corporate culture, former employees said, in which top executives cast traditional business controls by the wayside. And that -- from top officers who insisted they were unaware of financial details to a relaxed attitude about conflicts that let executives sit on both sides of multimillion-dollar deals -- figured heavily in Enron's collapse. 
"The lack of risk controls was mind boggling," said Gary Cardone, president of Dynegy Europe, whose parent company has hired a number of energy traders and other employees from Enron. "The Enron culture went way too far."
Vance Meyer, a spokesman for Enron, said such criticisms were unfairly vague. "When allegations are made about controls and culture at Enron, my hope is that people don't paint all employees with the same broad brush, despite what a handful of people might or might not have done," he said. "There are 20,000 great people here who deserve a shot at putting this company back on its feet."
Enron distanced itself from those it considered the old fogies of the energy industry, laying claim instead to being among the mold-breaking dot-coms, a company reliant on information and new ideas rather than hard assets. And like many an Internet start-up in its heyday, Enron spent freely on image and luxury.
At employee meetings for one division, Enron International, a live elephant made a cameo appearance -- twice. Enron Energy Services, another money-losing unit, spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to build a Potemkin-village trading floor to impress equity analysts invited to a conference, though the unit had no trading function. For one family picnic, Enron rented the 85-acre Astroworld amusement park.
At work, the attention to quotidian comfort was boundless: free laptops and hand-held devices, the best ergonomic chairs money could buy, office lunches at Houston's best restaurants. Workers fondly recalled the day in May 1998 when Enron's shares surpassed the $50 mark and the company left $100 bills on each employee's desk.
"Appearances were very important," said Jeff Gray, a former economist at Enron Energy Services. "It was important for employees to believe the hype just as it was important for analysts and investors to believe it."
Although many large corporations routinely treat employees to trips and amenities, at Enron, the scale of spending was vast, particularly by Houston's standards. 
"Enron was doing so many things on the edge," said Carol Freedenthal, a principal at Jofree Energy Consulting here. "The Enron people were really living high on the hog compared to most energy people. Nobody went like Enron."
And many employees concluded that they deserved the perks, since joining Enron often meant 12-hour workdays and ceaseless travel. 
"I would go away for a three-day trip that would turn into a three-month trip," one former Enron International executive said.
Devotion was well rewarded. Enron paid much better than its counterparts in Houston and often competed with top Wall Street firms for talent. Enron employees flew first-class or business-class and stayed exclusively at luxury hotels. The company's parking garage was filled with Porsches, Ferraris and BMW's, emblems of the sizable bonuses many employees earned. 
Gambling was popular, as at many high-risk, high-reward companies. The annual N.C.A.A. basketball tournament pools, in which college teams were "auctioned" to fans, sometimes reached nearly $90,000, another former Enron International executive said. 
In the early 1990's, Enron took clients to the Hyatt Regency in Beaver Creek, a luxurious Colorado resort, for ski trips, but over time such visits mostly turned into an internal Enron perk, this executive said. For one meeting in 1999, Enron flew in more than 300 of its vice presidents from around the globe to the Hyatt, where rooms now start at $320 a night. "It was three days of fun in the snow," one manager said. "It must have cost them a fortune."
Employees in the broadband unit, Enron's failed attempt to enter the high-speed Internet delivery business, frequently used sport utility limousines, even to go to lunch, and stayed in five-star hotels. "Nobody I ever worked with stayed in a Holiday Inn," said Katherine Harper, an administrative assistant who handled expense reports for the unit.
The bill for all this was footed by Enron Capital and Trade, the natural gas and electricity trading business (later called Enron North America) upon which the company built its reputation in the years before its collapse. The message within Enron, employees said, was that the trading business would subsidize huge investments in new ventures like broadband, international power projects and retail energy services until these, too, became money makers. But they never did. 
"We'd run up these huge bills, but we weren't making any money," one Enron International manager said. "Enron Capital and Trade made all the money, and we spent it."
Spend they did. In the fall of 1997, the 1,000 or so employees of Enron International gathered at the Del Lago Resort outside Houston for the unit's annual meeting. To open one morning session, the two top executives, Rebecca Mark and Joseph Sutton, rode into the room and onto the stage on Harley-Davidson motorcycles, engines revving as the Survivor song "Eye of the Tiger" blared. Dressed in leather jackets and chaps, they told the pep rally that the international unit was unstoppable. 
Each division then put on a skit it had polished for weeks, often with the help of professional choreographers. The capper was when one executive in charge of Enron's big power project in India rode in on a horse and another entered on an elephant. It was the second year that an elephant made it to the gathering, former employees said.
The same culture of competitiveness spurred Enron units to try to outdo one another in the extravagance of their Christmas parties. In 2000, employees of Enron Energy Services attended a black-tie party at the Museum of Natural Science in Houston, its rooms decorated with ice sculptures. That same year, Enron Capital and Trade feted its employees and their companions, about 5,000 people, at Enron Field; one guest remarked on the overabundance of everything that night -- the food, the liquor, the number of waiters. (Last year's planned party at the stadium was to be an all-company affair, in recognition of Enron's straitened circumstances.)
Enron also spared few expenses to impress outsiders. In early 1998, the company hoped to persuade Wall Street analysts it invited to Houston that a new venture, Enron Energy Services, would soon deliver big profits. Assuming that the analysts would be most impressed by the hurly-burly of trading, Enron in three weeks built a highly advanced trading floor at its headquarters.
As first reported by The Wall Street Journal, former employees said they rehearsed what to do in front of the analysts, and on the big day, computer technicians and secretaries were brought in to pretend that they were Energy Services "traders." Enron declined to comment on the episode.
Enron executives had a flair for generating new businesses and renaming old ones. Units were sometimes reorganized three or four times a year, which always meant moving people around, at a cost of roughly $500 a person just to set up a new desk, according to Cheryl Brashier, who worked at the company for nearly 11 years as an administrative assistant. On any given weekend, several hundred people would be moved from one floor to another at Enron headquarters, she said. 
Accounting had a hard time keeping up with the continual reshuffling, former employees said, and that gave departments the chance to hide lavish spending. Once a business was reorganized, it received its own accounting "cost code," or identification number, but the old codes were not immediately expunged.
"We were supposed to keep to budgets and orders were supposed to go through us," Ms. Brashier said, describing the work of administrative assistants. But employees circumvented procedures by ordering items on their own and by charging purchases to the newly abandoned cost centers. 
Like other former employees, Ms. Brashier and her friend Angela Buis, who worked in the Broadband unit, remember Enron's excesses with a mix of amazement and wistfulness.
Ms. Brashier's boss at Enron Capital and Trade, for example, sent 22 secretaries on a New Orleans trip to thank them for their hard work.
"We knew we weren't making money," Ms. Buis said. "But the extravagance, you know, is what made it great to work there."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Optimistic Reports by G.M. and Lowe's Push Shares Up

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stocks rallied yesterday after General Motors and Lowe's said business was picking up and a report showed that existing homes sold at a record pace in January.
 Together, the news suggested that consumer spending was driving a rebound in corporate profit. 
 "The worst is over," said Eric T. McKissack, manager of the Ariel Appreciation Fund. "The market is getting more confident." 
The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 177.56 points, or 1.8 percent, to 10,145.71, its highest close in seven weeks. The Nasdaq composite index jumped 45.34 points, or 2.6 percent, to 1,769.88, its biggest one-day gain since Jan 3.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index advanced 19.59 points, or 1.8 percent, to 1,109.43, led by General Electric and Intel.
Speculation -- prompted by the Enron scandal -- that companies have used accounting to overstate profits is overdone, said Edward Kerschner, chief global strategist at UBS Warburg.
"Earnings quality is remarkably good," he said in a research note.
Expectations for an economic recovery were bolstered by a report from the National Association of Realtors that showed home sales increased more than expected last month.
General Motors climbed $2.37, to $55.48. G.M., the biggest automaker, raised its estimate for first-quarter and full-year earnings, citing better-than-expected sales in the United States.
Ford Motor, the No. 2 automaker, advanced 65 cents, to $15.23. DaimlerChrysler rose $1.85, to $39.73.
General Electric, the biggest company by market value, gained $1.11, to $39.20.
Lowe's rose $1.44, to $47.49. The company, the second-largest home- improvement retailer after Home Depot, said first-quarter profit would top analysts' estimates and that fiscal fourth-quarter earnings had jumped more than expected.
Intel, the largest chip maker, rose $1.49, to $31.02, and Microsoft gained $1.09, to $59.08.
Sun Microsystems rose 80 cents, to $8.87, trimming its decline this year to 28 percent.
A Banc of America Securities analyst, Joel Wagonfeld, said Sun Microsystems, a maker of server computers that run Web sites and corporate networks, was inexpensive and would benefit in the second half as demand picked up. 
Williams Communications fell 29 cents, closing at 22 cents and extending its decline this year to 91 percent.
Williams Communications, a phone-and-data network operator, said it might seek bankruptcy protection from creditors, threatening to leave its former parent, the Williams Companies, responsible for $2.6 billion of costs.
The Williams Companies, meanwhile, tumbled $1.46, to close at $14.84. --------------------

Treasury Prices Fall
By Reuters
Treasury bond prices slid yesterday as stocks soared.
A record 16.2 percent increase in existing-home sales, to a 6.04 million annualized unit rate in January, also took the wind out of Treasuries as the data underscored a vibrant and healthy housing market and raised hopes for a swift recovery.
The 10-year note fell 6/32 , to a price of 100 7/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, rose to 4.85 percent from 4.82 percent on Friday.
The price of a 30-year bond fell 11/32 , to 100 6/32 . Its yield rose to 5.36 percent from 5.34 percent.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: EATING WELL; 
Unraveling a Caviar Mystery

BYLINE:  By Marian Burros 

 BODY:
WHEN Russian sevruga caviar was selling for $20 to $30 an ounce a couple of years ago, a thought crossed my mind: How does Trader Joe's sell it for $11? I asked the same question for years when caviar wars in New York at Christmas produced unbelievably low prices. Now I think I have the answer.
 Some people who sell caviar are crooks. The business of buying and selling one of the rarest, most highly prized foods in the world has always had more than its share of bootleggers, smugglers, counterfeiters and run-of-the-mill greedy entrepreneurs willing to destroy a species to make a buck. 
 These days it is both easier and harder than ever to skirt the law, because the best caviar in the world comes from the dwindling population of sturgeon in the Caspian Sea, which is bordered by nations of the former Soviet Union, where smugglers and poachers operate freely. At the same time the United States has tightened restrictions on caviar imports to protect the fish. 
Dr. Ellen Pikitch, director of marine programs for the Wildlife Conservation Society, said there has been more than a 40 percent decline in the population of mature beluga sturgeon in the northern part of the Caspian Sea in the last seven years, and that there is no longer evidence of mature beluga sturgeon in the middle and southern Caspian.
Since 1998, three major cases of caviar smuggling have led to convictions, jail terms and fines, in one case of $10 million. The most recent was announced by the Justice Department last month. Many individual couriers have also been caught trying to smuggle suitcases of caviar into the United States. 
Four years ago, when controls on imported and domestic caviar went into effect under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, the Fish and Wildlife Service of the Interior Department stepped up surveillance. Now importing and exporting caviar require documentation and permits. 
"We are looking into something that was probably rife with black market dealings for decades," said Sal Amato, who is in charge of law enforcement at the Maryland and Delaware offices of the Fish and Wildlife Service. "There's too much money to be made, too much incentive to circumvent the guidelines that have been set up to preserve the sturgeon."
In the latest case, Alfred Yazbak, president and owner of Connoisseur Brands Ltd. of New York, is scheduled to go to prison for two years and will pay fines and duties of $185,000 for "conspiring to smuggle protected sturgeon caviar," "selling counterfeit caviar to retail food companies with false labels" and "making false statements" over four or five years, according to court papers.
Retailers who purchased caviar from Connoisseur, like Dean & DeLuca, Balducci's and Zabar's, say they were duped. The criminal activity affects domestic caviar as well. Because of the reduced supply of Caspian Sea caviar -- it is more difficult to import and there is less of it than before -- some unscrupulous dealers are buying the roe of the American paddlefish and selling it as Russian sevruga.
The Fish and Wildlife agents called their undercover efforts Operation Malossol, for the method of preserving caviar by lightly salting it, and Operation Wedgehead, for the nickname of the American paddlefish. 
In a recent sting, an agent posed as a buyer from the specialty food chain Sutton Place Gourmet, which owns Balducci's. Mr. Yazbak sold him what he claimed was Russian sevruga caviar, but DNA testing proved it was not; the vast majority of the eggs came from American paddlefish, a protected species indigenous to the United States. Paddlefish caviar is not as expensive, but, the Justice Department said, "it can be passed off to the uninformed consumer as sevruga caviar from the Caspian Sea." 
Rod Mitchell, owner of Browne Trading, which sells fish and caviar to many of the finest restaurants in the country, said an expert caviar buyer could definitely tell the difference between paddlefish caviar and sevruga. "Paddlefish caviar has a very distinct taste and a slightly muddy flavor," Mr. Mitchell said. "It's very different. If you see cheap caviar you know it's illegal, meaning bootlegged, previously frozen or there's something wrong with it, and people who buy it are interested in only one thing: price."
While the first sting against Mr. Yazbak was under way, another Fish and Wildlife agent, posing as a fisherman, warned Mr. Yazbak that the paddlefish roe he was selling was illegal. Mr. Yazbak bought it anyway. (Lest anyone think government agents killed protected fish for the operation, they used roe that had been seized in another unlawful harvesting operation.) 
In one taped conversation, Mr. Yazbak told the phony fisherman that he wanted everything he could bring him, whether it was of good quality or not.
Mr. Yazbak was also convicted of purchasing black-market caviar smuggled out of the former Soviet Union in the luggage of couriers. Because the caviar was not in the best condition, it underwent a process known as caviar washing. The frozen caviar is defrosted, drained of its oil, washed with salted water, mixed with walnut or hazelnut oil to disguise bad smells or tastes and then partially pasteurized. It is sold as unpasteurized caviar, the most expensive kind.
"Caviar smuggling is not that much different from narcotics smuggling," said Richard A. Udell, a senior trial lawyer at the Justice Department who prosecuted two of the major cases. "Law enforcement must assume it is only catching a small part of the criminal conduct. These people have helped to hasten the demise of a prehistoric animal."
Talking about a friend who had already gone to jail for smuggling and mislabeling caviar, Mr. Yazbak told an undercover officer: "They'll put him in jail for it. I don't want to go to jail. You know. Not for caviar."

HEADLINE: They Steal Napkins, Don't They? (And That's Just a Start) 

BYLINE:  By DONNA PAUL; Additional reporting by Amanda Hesser.

 BODY:
ON a recent Friday night at Ten Penh, a sleek fusion restaurant in Washington, three friends gathered around a table of small luxuries: a tin of caviar the size of a hockey puck, many pink cosmopolitans and three mother-of-pearl caviar spoons.
 It was an evening to savor. And one of the women -- a 32-year-old design professional who will remain nameless -- wanted a little something to help remember it. She wanted one of those little spoons. 
 "I rationalized that the restaurant probably had 200 of them," she said. And with that thought, she slipped the spoon into her bag. After wiping it clean with a napkin, of course. 
As chefs have achieved celebrity status, dining out has become a theatrical event, with the setting and the props as thrilled over as the tuna tartare. Restaurants have become temples of design, filled with beautiful objects. And diners are helping themselves to more than just the bread. A lot more.
From $3 water glasses to $1,200 silver ice buckets, from vintage photographs hanging on the walls to scented candles burning in the bathrooms -- if it isn't nailed down, diners have walked off with it. Over the course of a year, restaurants around the country lose as much as 3 percent of their earnings to theft by customers who seem to be getting more brazen by the minute. Demitasse spoons, Peugeot pepper mills, imported wineglasses, Frette linens, framed artwork, serving platters, Champagne buckets. The list of stolen goods boggles the imagination. And the ways restaurateurs are coping with the phenomenon is changing the dining experience for everyone.
"I'm considering installing metal detectors at the door," said Geoffrey Zakarian, the chef and owner of Town in Manhattan. He was only half joking. Within three months of the restaurant's opening last March, at least 125 of its dot-patterned custom-designed glasses were missing. Not to mention the 60 place settings of Richard Meier flatware that disappeared, or the 200 logo ashtrays. 
Sitting at the bar on a recent afternoon, Mr. Zakarian gestured to the silver cocktail shakers and almost casually mentioned how they have been taken, "with ice still in them." Once, he watched a customer open her purse and pop two glasses inside it. As she left, he introduced himself and said, "I am flattered that you have chosen my glasses to steal, enjoy them." 
Perhaps Danny Meyer should have been even more flattered. At his restaurant in the Flatiron district, Gramercy Tavern, a designer sconce was ripped from the wall in the men's room during the dinner service. Mr. Meyer didn't bother replacing it. Still, he wondered, "How do you possibly add value, for the customer, to the experience of going into the bathroom?" So, he burns ginger and grapefruit candles by Jo Malone that cost him $25 each. And those are out the door on a daily basis. 
At D'Artagnan in Midtown, Ariane Daguin, an owner, trained employees to count every item on the table and be sure it all comes back, particularly the $32 Laguiole steak knives. "Those were easy to take because you could fold them," she said. 
One night a waiter spotted a man putting one in his napkin. "So what I did was, I put it on the bill," Ms. Daguin said. "And when they saw the bill, they decided to return the knife. That's how we dealt with it."
Then there is the matter of stolen artwork. Incredibly, large paintings and photographs disappear from restaurant walls. At Colvin Run Tavern, Bob Kinkead's new spot in suburban Virginia, "we caught someone taking a photograph of me and Bill Clinton," Mr. Kinkead said. "You know, under a raincoat, one of those deals. I said 'Give it back,' and he gave it back."
Eleven Madison Park in New York had a $1,500 vintage photograph taken. 
And Lydia Shire, the chef and owner of Biba in Boston, was crushed when one of her treasured possessions vanished: "The day my mother's painting was stolen, that was it for me," she said.
Since then, Ms. Shire has taken over Locke-Ober, one of Boston's oldest dining establishments, and she has had other losses to endure: a $1,200 silver Champagne bucket from Paris, silver coasters and a Murano glass decanter. All are gone.
The impulse to take things is powerful, and complicated. Suzanne Goin, the chef at Lucques in Los Angeles, says customers think that because they're spending money it is acceptable for them to take what they want. They may want a souvenir of the evening, like the woman at Ten Penh, or a thrill, or even a measure of revenge, if they were unhappy with the experience. 
Some simply can't resist the allure of a great-looking object. One diner at Town, a 50-year-old man who calls himself an obsessive collector, entered the men's room and was struck by the display of plastic Statue of Liberty replicas arranged grid-like on the wall. "I thought it was incredible, innovative, really cool," he said. And as his eyes scanned the wall, he noticed five had been removed. He wiggled one of the statues. It popped off -- and went right into his pocket. 
After 200 statues were taken, the restaurant sealed them all behind plexiglass.
Restaurants figure on losing 2 to 3 percent of their "service ware" over the course of a year, said Arlene Spiegel, the president of Arlene Spiegel & Associates, a food and beverage consulting firm in Manhattan.
Most chefs agree that theft contributes to the rising cost of menu prices -- though not enormously. They chalk it up to the cost of doing business, something that's more of a constant nuisance than a serious dollar issue. The items stolen aren't usually worth enough to submit an insurance claim, let alone a crime report. And even when they are, restaurateurs tend not to. Not one of the dozens interviewed for this article has ever prosecuted a customer for theft.
"It's really expensive to prosecute," Mr. Kinkead said. "For the amount you're going to spend, and the time spent in court, it's not worth it."
Prof. Robert McCrie, who teaches security management at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said that everyone in the hospitality industry struggles with this issue. "The conflict is, what is the patron permitted to take with impunity and encouragement?" he said. "Business cards, matchbooks, leftover food -- that's it. Beyond that, these people are committing a criminal act, and should be treated as such." If a small item is taken, it's petty larceny, he said; if the value is $1,000 or more, according to the New York State penal law, it is grand larceny.
Gary Levy, a partner at J. H. Cohn, an accounting and consulting firm that specializes in restaurants, said that his clients budget 2 to 3 percent of their gross sales to replacing "lost" items. That includes breakage, wear and tear, and theft.
"Anything with writing on it says 'take me,' " said George Germon, an owner of Al Forno in Providence, R.I. Tracy Nieporent, the marketing director for the Myriad restaurant group, which owns several New York restaurants, concurs. "An item is very game for taking when the restaurant's name is on it," he said.
The restrooms, however, seem to have their own subculture, where emboldened thieves will stop at nothing. Faucets are the big item here. Yes, faucets. Mr. Germon woefully tells his tale of the disappearance of an antique bronze fixture from France. He had had a pair of them installed in the men's room. One evening, as the chefs were tending to the wood fire, preparing the restaurant's famous grilled pizza, someone else was busy in the men's room, removing the precious antique. The thief even took the time to install a replacement faucet that was a cheap American reproduction. "I couldn't believe it -- whoever did this knew exactly how," Mr. Germon said. "They were so good, they even used Teflon tape."
A similar thing happened at Oran Mor, a restaurant on Nantucket. On a busy Saturday night, as Peter Wallace, the chef and an owner, was sweating over the stove, he was told that the faucet handles in the ladies' room had been removed. This time, the thief left no replacement. "It was so infuriating," Mr. Wallace said. "We had to use vise grips to get through the night."
At Lucques, Ms. Goin laments the loss of flowers from the restrooms. "The customers walk right out the door with them," she said.
Preventing theft, said Stephen Zagor, the director of management programs at the Institute for Culinary Education in New York, is a matter of vigilance. "Keeping a watchful eye," he said. Without the customer noticing, of course. "We teach our managers-to-be or our owners-to-be to impart a feeling of ownership to the waiters." 
For example, what seems to be a gracious act of service -- the tuxedo-clad waiter wielding a pepper mill the size of a baseball bat -- is more likely a restaurateur's attempt to prevent theft of pepper mills that once sat on the table, Mr. Meyer said.
Bradley Ogden, the Northern California restaurateur, makes the waiters responsible for retrieving the small saucepans he uses to serve some dishes at his new restaurant, Parcel 104, in Santa Clara. He figures that the pans are likely targets, and says making the waiters feel responsible gives them "ownership mentality."
It isn't just the waiters who are watching, either. The bathroom attendant is there to do more than hand out towels, and those video cameras restaurants have begun installing to monitor service also help keep an eye on customers. 
"It is obviously a theft issue, but it's also a security issue," Ms. Spiegel said of the cameras and attendants. "No one will come forward and tell you it's a theft issue."
Restaurant designers are becoming more aware of creating "control points," she said, meaning that expensive objects are placed where someone is always nearby. Steve Hanson, the owner of Blue Water Grill, Blue Fin and other Manhattan restaurants, uses antitheft hinges to bolt all artwork to the walls and glues down other pieces of art.
Tom Douglas, the chef and owner of the Dahlia Lounge in Seattle, learned the hard way. He was busy cleaning the kitchen one night when one of his prize $1,000 fish-shaped lamps disappeared from the dining room. The last table was lingering late, he recalls, and the waiters weren't paying attention. It was only after the room cleared that they noticed the papier-mache and bamboo lamp on that table was gone.
"It was not an easy thing to take, the shade was the shape and size of a 15-pound rockfish," Mr. Douglas said. After that, he screwed the lamps to the tabletops. 
No wonder some restaurants are becoming less extravagant with their decor. It's a double-edged sword, said Mr. Meyer, who believes that one of the ways restaurants distinguish themselves is by making the tabletop look special. But the more attractive it is, the more guests want what's on it. 
When Mr. Germon opened Al Forno with Johanne Killeen, the couple hand-carried 2,000 pieces of overscaled silverware from Italy. In six years they were all gone. Then, Ms. Killeen said, the couple went to France and brought back more silver. That, too, is gone. Today, their flatware is an Asian knockoff of the original Italian pattern. 
Ms. Spiegel knows of a restaurant that went to a cheaper napkin once they began noticing that they always came back with fewer Frette napkins than they put out. 
"It's a collection of things that devalue the overall dining experience," Ms. Spiegel said, "and I think at this time, in this economic climate, restaurants are really looking at these ways to save money."
Finally, many restaurateurs have decided the best strategy is to simply go into the housewares business themselves.
Mr. Zakarian has since made the more "popular" items at Town for sale. Not a bad idea, considering he sells the pepper mills that cost him $75 for $200. D'Artagnan also sells the Laguiole knives (though Ms. Daguin worries that when diners see the price, they may be more inclined to steal them, not less) and the silverware. If customers ask, Mr. Meyer, who is also an owner of Eleven Madison Park, Tabla and other Manhattan restaurants, offers much of what they use, wholesale.
One 60-year-old woman, who has been taking silverware and plates from restaurants for nearly 40 years, spoke about it with passion. And entitlement. "It was all about the shape and having the name on it," she said, of the many spoons she has slipped into purses and pockets from such legendary places as La Grenouille, the Carlyle Hotel, the Tour d'Argent in Paris and the Hotel de Paris in Monte Carlo. Even a spoon from the Mount Sinai cafeteria. Yes, the hospital.
Now all are glued neatly into a gold frame and on display in her dining room. Recently the spoon collector has slacked off. And not because restaurants are making it more difficult. Most, she complains, no longer emblazon their logos on their spoons.
"If there's a place that still has some silver with a name on it," she said, "let me know."

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence Declines On Concern About Employment 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 26 

 BODY:
Consumer confidence fell this month as concerns about unemployment and the reliability of company earnings reports dimmed enthusiasm that had been building since September, a private research group said today.
 The Conference Board reported that its gauge of sentiment dropped to 94.1 after rising to 97.8 in January. The decline was the first in three months and was larger than expected. More than 80 percent of those surveyed indicated they were concerned about jobs. 
 The decline may be a one-time occurrence that also reflects doubts over stock values in the wake of revelations about deceptive accounting at the Enron Corporation, analysts said. Consumers remained optimistic about economic conditions in coming months.
"While consumers see the future as reasonably bright, they live in the present," said Oscar Gonzalez, an economist at John Hancock Financial Services Inc. "They're worried about their jobs, but at the same time, I think they sense that this mild recession appears to be ending, and that will raise their hopes."
The confidence index sank to its lowest level in seven and a half years in November as Americans were still reeling from the September terrorist attacks. Since then, confidence has increased as the country made progress in the war against terrorism and evidence built that the economy was rebounding from its economic slump.
While February's gauge of consumer expectations for the next six months fell to 93.6, it is still the second highest since August. 
"Expectations are the key" to increased consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of the economy, said Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics Ltd. The expectations index "is unlikely to fall too much further and remains consistent with consumer spending growth of about 3 percent."
The index measuring current conditions dropped to 94.8 this month, the lowest since October 1994, from 98.1 in January. That may be the result of an unemployment rate that reached its highest in six and a half years in December and a decrease in stock values.
The Conference Board report showed less optimism about labor markets. The share of consumers who said jobs were plentiful fell to 17.8 percent in February from 18.4 percent in January. The share that said jobs were not so plentiful rose to 59.4 percent from 59.1 percent.

HEADLINE: In Zimbabwe, Mugabe Runs Against an Old Rival: Colonialism 

BYLINE:  By RACHEL L. SWARNS 

DATELINE: HARARE, Zimbabwe, Feb. 26 

 BODY:
The political banners proclaimed: "Zimbabwe will never be a colony again." The crowd roared its willingness to fight the old enemy. When President Robert Mugabe finally stepped behind the microphone today at a campaign rally in a ramshackle township here, he was ready for battle.
 Mr. Mugabe described the presidential elections, on March 9 and 10, as the last round of the liberation struggle, the last chance to rid the country of the vestiges of colonialism. He assailed the opposition candidate, Morgan Tsvangirai, as a front man for whites who hoped to control the country. 
 "We must decide whether we shall be the decision makers of Zimbabwe, or whether the British and their settlers here, using stooges, will remain in power over us," cried Mr. Mugabe, who is 78. "Imperialism must fail! We must crush it here."
Westerners scoff at the notion that Zimbabwe might be threatened by its white minority or by Britain, the former colonial ruler. After all, Mr. Mugabe won his liberation struggle 22 years ago when he became this country's leader and ended white rule. But his message still resonates with some Zimbabweans.
In many ways, the coming election reflects this divided nation's struggle to come to terms with the past, and the role that history should play in the future. Almost every day now, the relevance of the liberation struggle in modern Zimbabwe is debated.
The government says that whites here and abroad have undertaken a campaign to demonize Mr. Mugabe in an effort to derail his plan to force the white minority here to return land that was seized from blacks during colonial rule. 
Opposition party supporters say the struggle with whites is largely irrelevant in a country where blacks control the government, and most ordinary people struggle just to survive. The opposition says Mr. Mugabe is using whites as scapegoats to avoid taking responsibility for a collapsing economy.
But even opposition officials acknowledge that the anxiety about whites still simmers in some places. Whites here still control more than half of the fertile land as well as the banks, manufacturing and mines. Whites are also financing the opposition party of Mr. Tsvangirai.
This week, he was charged with treason along with two colleagues in what the government described as a plot to assassinate Mr. Mugabe supported by Britain and the United States. The opposition dismissed the charges as a ploy to sully the reputation of its leader before the election. 
Whether voters accept Mr. Mugabe's message will certainly influence the outcome of next week's election. In the impoverished Harare township of Epworth, which voted overwhelmingly for the opposition in the parliamentary elections in 2000, the debate bubbled up in shouts and murmurs today as thousands of people awaited Mr. Mugabe's arrival.
"He fought for liberation and he wants to leave what he fought for to the young generation," said Edward Raposa, 39, who was waving a banner with a picture of Mr. Mugabe. "The economy is still in the hands of the whites. That has to change."
Norman Viyora, a 29-year-old opposition supporter, disagreed.
"Me, I don't think it's going to be a colony if this opposition party wins," Mr. Viyora said. "That's the message that's being spread, but that's not the reality."
Mr. Viyora said that he and others were forced to attend the rally by government supporters who went door to door before Mr. Mugabe arrived and threatened anyone who expressed reluctance.
Mr. Mugabe blamed whites for sabotaging the economy and vowed today that the economy would improve if he was reelected.
"I won't let you down," Mr. Mugabe said. "I won't retreat. I don't know the word surrender. I didn't know it in the past and I don't know it now."

HEADLINE: Rethinking Dire Warnings By Insurers After Sept. 11 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
Last fall, soon after the attack on the World Trade Center, the nation's insurance companies, supported by bankers, builders and real estate companies, warned that if Congress did not shield the insurers from losses in future attacks, terrorism coverage would vanish and the economy would grind to a halt.
 But Congress did not act. Now, two months into the new year, the consequences appear to be far milder than the insurers suggested. 
 Commercial insurance costs in general have risen steeply, and terrorism coverage, still extremely limited, is particularly expensive. But there is growing evidence that American businesses and their insurers are solving their problems without Washington's help. 
Terrorism coverage, which was unobtainable immediately after the September attacks, is becoming more widely available and in larger amounts. Premiums are falling as more insurers enter the market.
So what of the dire predictions? The proponents of government intervention, which include Bush administration officials, maintain that hard times are coming -- that calamity has simply been slow to develop. They say that the lack of full terrorism coverage at reasonable prices is creating a drag on the economy, the effect of which may not be felt for months.
"This is a slow-moving glacier that will destroy everything in its path," said Stephen Bartlett, the president of the Financial Services Roundtable, an association of some of the largest insurers and banks.
The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, echoed those concerns in a report released yesterday afternoon. The report, requested by Representative Michael G. Oxley, the author of legislation providing for government assistance that has so far succeeded only in the House, cited nine examples across the nation of unidentified commercial property owners being unable to get full or partial terrorism coverage or being unwilling to pay what insurers were asking. A Congressional hearing on terrorism coverage is scheduled for this afternoon.
But Congress's interest in the issue has generally cooled as it has become preoccupied with the Enron debacle, and major business disruptions have yet to occur. Many insurers doubt that, barring another major attack, any help will be coming from Washington.
Some in Congress still say that they favor government intervention, but no action is scheduled. "The air has been taken out of the balloon," a Democratic staff member in the Senate said. "The urgency doesn't seem to be there. We're now into February, and we don't seem to have a major problem."
Proponents of Washington intervention contended last fall that without terrorism coverage, banks would stop lending, real estate transactions would halt and new construction would cease.
Insurers, who had previously included terrorism coverage in standard commercial policies, began excluding it, saying that the risks were unpredictable and potentially bankrupting. The only hope, they said, was government intervention.
So far, that seems to be an overstatement. More than a dozen entrepreneurial insurance companies are now collectively offering up to $500 million in coverage per building. This is less than the cost of replacing the tallest buildings, those most likely to be attacked, but more than enough for most commercial properties. The policies cover physical damage to property from terrorism and, in some cases, loss of business income.
Dazzled by the enormous premiums that terrorism coverage is generating -- sometimes 10 or 20 times basic commercial property insurance -- several other insurers, including Allianz of Germany, Swiss Reinsurance and Zurich Financial Services, are considering offering it.
"They're looking at this as a new product line to grow their revenue," said Gary Mathieson, a senior executive at Willis Group Holdings, a big insurance broker.
For their part, businesses are either paying for terrorism coverage or betting that they are unlikely targets and can put off buying policies until premiums drop.
Scores of corporations are talking with consultants about setting up their own insurance companies. The Air Transport Association of America, the trade group for the nation's big airlines, said it hoped to decide soon whether to start an insurance cooperative.
In New York, some big real estate transactions have stalled over negotiations for terrorism coverage, but others are proceeding. The market for bonds based on commercial mortgages, which are secured by buildings, is going strong.
Darrell Wheeler, a financial analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, said the terrorist attacks have had virtually no effect on 80 percent of the $70 billion market in commercial mortgage bonds. Most older bonds are trading at about the same prices, he said, and new ones are being issued. But for the remainder of the market, there is some reluctance to finance projects of $100 million or more, he said, and some investors are reluctant to buy bonds tied to individual office towers, apartment buildings and shopping malls.
Instead of foreclosing on existing loans because buildings now lack full insurance coverage, lenders are increasing their interest charges, requesting borrowers to put up more cash, or, as a real estate executive said, "holding their breath."
Some financial institutions have also begun softening their insurance coverage requirements. Instead of insisting on full coverage, some lenders now just say that borrowers should make "reasonable efforts" to obtain terrorism coverage.
Mr. Mathieson said that $100 million in terrorism coverage could easily cost $5 million to $10 million a year, down from $20 million at the end of last year, but this is an approximation. Late last year, a nationwide retailer, which did not want to be identified, said it received quotes of $3 million and $7.5 million for $150 million of terrorism coverage. Now, Mr. Mathieson said, the retailer is buying the coverage for $450,000.
Kenneth A. Froot, a financial economist at Harvard Business School, confirmed this trend. "It looks like the market is beginning to work this out," he said. "We haven't moved to the point where we have as much coverage as we need. But we should see continuing improvement over the next 12 to 18 months."
Proponents of government intervention say that the situation is worse than it appears, but that documenting the harm is difficult. "Nobody wants to be seen as having a 'serious' problem," said Deborah B. Beck, executive vice president of the Real Estate Board of New York, an association of brokers, builders and financial institutions. 
Sheila C. Bair, assistant secretary of the Treasury for financial institutions, said the Bush administration remained committed to legislation that would pay 90 percent of all terrorism losses in excess of $10 billion.
Professor Froot and some other economists say that the government should keep its distance from terrorism coverage. "There are big benefits from delaying any government plan," he said. "First, the true price will emerge, as opposed to an artificial one. Second, prices will force people to make decisions about construction and security. With government intervention, that is not going to happen."
For some, though, the prospect of letting the economy find the way is daunting. "If this were a superhot economy, there might be more room for the economy to perfect itself," said Darcy Stacom, an executive vice president at Cushman & Wakefield, one of the largest commercial real estate brokers."
Commercial insurers said that even though they had more than $100 billion in capital, twice their losses from the September attacks, they could be wiped out by a cataclysmic terrorist attack, leaving claims unpaid.
"Not having a government backup for major terrorist attacks now is like saying you don't need an army until war has been declared," said Maurice R. Greenberg, chief executive of the American International Group, one of the world's largest insurers. "The industry has limited capacity. So while there is some coverage being offered, the reality is that it's not very much in relation to the potential need."
Both critics and supporters of intervention expect government assistance in the event of another big attack.
Business executives do not want to wait. Nelson Rising, chairman of the Real Estate Roundtable, is among those who argue that it would cost the government nothing to create a mechanism to protect insurers against monumental losses. The protection might never be used, he said, but it would give insurers confidence to offer abundant coverage at affordable prices. "By not taking action in advance," Mr. Rising said, "you run the risk of destabilizing the economy."

HEADLINE: Homeless Man Is Convicted Of Murder in 1989 Stabbing 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT F. WORTH 

 BODY:
More than 12 years after a young computer engineer was stabbed to death in the vestibule of his Upper West Side apartment building, a Manhattan jury convicted a homeless man yesterday of a second charge related to the slaying, concluding a case that had languished for years and that had ultimately been decided by the testimony of a fellow panhandler.
 The defendant, Frank Barnes, was convicted of felony murder charges yesterday, a day after being convicted of second-degree murder following a three-day trial. The felony murder charge applied because Mr. Barnes committed the crime in the course of another felony, in this case robbery, prosecutors say. 
 Mr. Barnes shook his head after the first verdict was read on Monday and denied his guilt until Justice Leslie Crocker Snyder of State Supreme Court in Manhattan told him to behave himself. He had no reaction to the second verdict yesterday.
Family and friends of the victim, David Burns, attended the trial, and expressed their relief afterward about a case that had seemed a lost cause. "We've been waiting for this a long time," said Bob Burns, 48, the victim's older brother. "It's mind-boggling how one episode can change so many people's lives."
That episode began when David Burns, 32, was stabbed to death as he returned from his girlfriend's house to his apartment on West 114th Street on July 29, 1989. The murder shocked the neighborhood, and at the time some residents said aggressive panhandlers in the area might have been to blame.
But investigators found few leads, and Bob Burns hired a private investigator in the early 1990's, to no avail. In 1996, officers in the Police Department's cold-case squad took over the case, and arrested Mr. Barnes, just over a year ago.
The trial turned on the testimony of James Salter, 40, an unemployed security guard who said he had seen Mr. Barnes running near the scene of the killing with a knife in his hand and blood on his shirt, and saying, "I shouldn't have done it, he didn't have any money anyway."
Mr. Salter, who was homeless and addicted to drugs at the time, said that Mr. Barnes tried to force him to jump in front of an oncoming subway train a few weeks later but that he escaped by running to the next station on the tracks before the train arrived.
Mr. Barnes's lawyer, Sol Schwartzberg, tried to cast doubt on Mr. Salter's trustworthiness by highlighting his lengthy history with drugs and petty crime. But Mr. Salter, who is no longer homeless and said he had been free of drugs and alcohol for almost five years, never wavered in his testimony.
Mr. Barnes faces up to 25 years to life in prison at his sentencing, scheduled for March 26.

HEADLINE: Alabama Governor Set for Tough Race 

BYLINE:  By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr. 

DATELINE: MONTGOMERY, Ala., Feb. 21 

 BODY:
When Donald Siegelman became governor three years ago, there was much talk that a new day had dawned in Alabama politics. 
 Mr. Siegelman spoke of improving schools, of consensus, of revamping the state's Constitution, a document of the Old South. He offered experience, having been elected lieutenant governor, secretary of state and state attorney general. 
 And he mostly avoided superheated language, the hallmark of so many Alabama politicians of the last half-century, including Fob James, whom Mr. Siegelman, a Democrat, handily turned out of office in the fall of 1998, though not before Mr. James had suggested that a Republican primary opponent was a "fat monkey" and insisted that the Bill of Rights did not apply in Alabama.
So three years later, is there really a new political day in Alabama?
Not yet, say many of the people who had high hopes for Mr. Siegelman. 
Battered by aggressive special-interest lobbies, weakness in the economy, a shortfall in tax receipts and a whiff of scandal, Mr. Siegelman has slipped steadily in the polls almost from the day he took office. By his own account, the governor, who turns 56 on Sunday, faces "a tough, hard-fought campaign" for re-election in the fall.
In trying to make good on his campaign promise to create a state-run lottery to finance education improvements, Mr. Siegelman ran afoul of several powerful lobbies, especially church and education groups. After church groups killed the lottery proposal, the education groups insisted that he find the money elsewhere, an all but impossible task with the economy faltering and every special interest grabbing for the remaining revenue.
Frustrated at being caught between the political power of the church groups and the intense anger of the education lobby, the governor threw up his hands at one point and lamented, "I have no Plan B."
Besides the policy challenges, the Siegelman administration faces accusations of cronyism and other misdeeds in the awarding of state contracts. State and federal prosecutors have won several guilty pleas after uncovering evidence that some state agencies awarded lucrative business contracts to the governor's friends and supporters without seeking competitive bids. Just last week The Birmingham News disclosed that some of his personal financial records had been subpoenaed. 
The paper also reported that in filing financial disclosure statements with the Alabama Ethics Commission, as is required of top state officials, Mr. Siegelman had failed over the last few years to list at least $100,000 in earnings from various investments and transactions, and been forced to file amended statements. 
Mr. Siegelman says the earnings were understated because the disclosure forms are confusing. As for his subpoenaed financial records, he denies any personal wrongdoing and accuses Republicans of conspiring to use leaks to the press to smear him as the election campaign gets under way.
State Attorney General Bill Pryor, a Republican, and the United States attorney in Montgomery, Leura Garrett Canary, an appointee of President Bush, declined to comment.
The latest polls, taken two weeks ago for The Birmingham News and The Mobile Register, suggest that the governor's prediction of a tough campaign may prove squarely on the mark. 
While showing Mr. Siegelman easily ahead in the race for the Democratic primary on June 4, the polls found him neck and neck with two Republican candidates: Lt. Gov. Steve Windom, whom Mr. Siegelman trailed by a couple of percentage points, and Representative Bob Riley of the Third Congressional District, in the east-central part of the state, whom the governor led by a couple of points. In the Republican primary matchup, Mr. Windom was ahead of Mr. Riley by about 10 points.
"It's unusual for a lieutenant governor, or a congressman little known beyond his own district, to be doing this well this soon against an incumbent governor," said Larry Powell, a political scientist at the University of Alabama-Birmingham who conducted the Birmingham News poll. "And his situation may be even worse than it looks at first, because the two latest polls were completed before word got out that his own financial records had been subpoenaed."
Mr. Windom, who calls Mr. Siegelman "ethically challenged" and whose campaign advertisements promise that "I'll stop the no-bid contracts," ridiculed the governor's assertion that Republicans were conspiring to smear him.
"If there's a conspiracy," Mr. Windom said, "it's a conspiracy by the governor and his administration to enrich the cronies and friends of the administration at the expense of the taxpayer."

HEADLINE: Smart, Generous, Low-Key And Indicted in Bribery Plot 

BYLINE:  By JANNY SCOTT 

 BODY:
He was the man who understood the arcana of an arcane process, a former tax assessor whom building owners could hire for a not inconsiderable fee and feel confident that they had retained the man who knew just what it took to convince an assessor to keep their tax bills down.
 There was nothing flashy about Albert Schussler, people in the real estate industry said yesterday about the 85-year-old tax consultant at the center of the city's alleged $10 million tax-assessment bribery scheme. Quite the contrary, they said; he always struck them as quiet, knowledgeable, down to earth. 
 And generous, too.
Mr. Schussler, who was indicted on Monday, was a major supporter of many Jewish charities -- a past president of the American Friends of the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, a director of the UJA-Federation of New York, a longtime supporter of the New Israel Fund and American Friends of the Open University of Israel. 
"He was a low-key guy, intelligent, a professional" said Jeffrey Gural, a building owner and manager who said Mr. Schussler had worked with Mr. Gural's father, Aaron. "It's like when you hire a lobbyist. You hope that he's going to convince whoever you hired him to lobby that your position is correct."
"And you also hope that he's doing it aboveboard," he said.
Mr. Schussler, a tax consultant and building owner who had previously worked in the assessor's office for 30 years, is said by the United States attorney's office in Manhattan to have offered assessors bribes ranging from expensive dinners to thousands of dollars in exchange for desirable assessments on buildings owned by him and by others who hired him to represent them.
A lawyer for Mr. Schussler, Steven Cohen, declined on Monday to comment on the charges.
Consultants like Mr. Schussler serve as intermediaries between some landlords and assessors, ostensibly supplying late-breaking information that might enable an assessor to better understand the economics of a building. "You want people who understand the process better than you," said Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York, a trade association.
Mr. Schussler is also an owner of the landmark Ansonia Hotel and other buildings on the Upper West Side. He has served on the real estate tax assessment committee of the Real Estate Board. He lives in the Sovereign, a 48-story glass tower on East 58th Street near Sutton Place.
Yesterday, Mr. Spinola, Mr. Gural and others described Mr. Schussler as quiet and extremely knowledgeable about tax assessments and real estate values. "If you had a conversation with him, you would be impressed with what he knew and the technical expertise he had in the area," Mr. Spinola said. "Which I think impressed an awful lot of people."
Mr. Gural said, "Being an ex-assessor, he understood more than anyone what the assessors look for, and what it would take to convince an assessor that a building shouldn't have its assessment raised." Mr. Gural, chairman of Newmark & Company, a leasing and management company, said his father hired Mr. Schussler as a consultant on some buildings in which the younger Mr. Gural was a partner.
Max Kampelman, a retired lawyer in Washington who said he had been an investor with Mr. Schussler in the Ansonia years ago, called him "a warm, plain, down-to-earth person." He recalled getting a letter from Mr. Schussler encouraging him to contribute to the American Friends of the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra.
In addition to supporting the orchestra, Mr. Schussler and his wife, Claire, are longtime donors to the New Israel Fund, which raises money to support civil rights, human rights and religious pluralism in Israel; and to the American Friends of the Open University of Israel, a distance-learning and online university.
A spokesman for the UJA-Federation said: "He's been very active over the years. He has served on our board of directors. He's been an active major contributor to the campaign for years and years and years."
Eric Heffler, executive vice president of the American Friends of the Open University of Israel, who said he had sought Mr. Schussler's advice in the past on strategic planning matters, said: "He's just a very sweet, wonderful gentleman and I am very, very hurt and sorry over what I'm reading. He is one of the nicest people I've ever met."

HEADLINE: Technology; 
Congressional Broadband Fight Intensifies

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 26 

 BODY:
Two weeks after the House of Representatives approved legislation to limit the influence of money in politics, the House is expected to approve a telecommunications bill that is largely shaped by the huge campaign contributions it has generated.
 The measure, a bill to deregulate the high-speed Internet market, has become known informally on Capitol Hill as the big bucks bill of the year, although it has little chance of becoming law any time soon. As a result, experts predict it will continue to be lucrative for lawmakers for years to come, encouraging the telecommunications industry to find ways to make tens of millions of dollars in contributions long after Congress completes its work on the campaign finance legislation. Senate leaders say the bill, to be taken up by the House on Wednesday, has virtually no hope of approval by the Senate this year. 
 The fight over the broadband bill is reminiscent of the great Congressional battles in the 1990's to revise the Depression-era banking laws, a decade-long struggle that yielded no new laws for years but generated millions of dollars for lobbyists and the campaigns of lawmakers as banks, insurers and securities firms fought one another to a draw.
The Internet measure, called the Tauzin-Dingell bill after its chief sponsors, has already provoked a multiyear pitched political battle over the broadband market among many of the wealthiest telecommunications companies. In the opening months of this election cycle, telecommunications companies have spent more than $5 million on contributions, and experts predict it will be the most lucrative legislative fight of the year, surpassing the fight over a patients' bill of rights that also generated huge contributions. 
On one side are the regional Bell companies -- BellSouth, Qwest, SBC Communications and Verizon -- that want to eliminate the restrictions of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. They say that law has prevented them from expanding more aggressively in the broadband market and that they face onerous requirements to lease their equipment and wires to start-ups in an ill-considered effort to promote competition. 
On the other side are the long-distance carriers, like AT&T, WorldCom and Sprint, and some cable companies and the competitive start-ups, which favor the current rules and worry that changes will cost them revenue and permit the Bell companies to grow even stronger in the regions where they already dominate local phone service.
Both supporters and detractors of the legislation describe a kind of political arms race -- a need to continue spending millions on contributions, lobbying and marketing simply to try to keep up with the other side.
"The costs are rapidly getting out of control," said William M. Daley, the former commerce secretary in the Clinton administration who is president of SBC. "There is a general sense that sure, we'd like to be spending our efforts on other things. But if the other side is spending $20 million on advertisements, or whatever it is that they are spending, then we have to respond."
On the other side of the issue, Royce J. Holland, the chief executive of Allegiance Telecom Inc., a smaller competitor to the largest phone carriers, said that "the regional Bell money has been responsible for every piece of this legislation."
Blair Levin, a former senior official at the Federal Communications Commission who is a regulatory analyst at Legg Mason, said that the political climate bears an interesting resemblance to the marketplace. "As markets know and consumers know and politicians know, competition is a good thing," he said. "It's much more fun for a politician to go to a fund-raiser when both sides are present."
Precise figures on the lobbying effort have not been filed, although during the 1999-2000 election cycle, telephone companies and others with interest in the legislation gave more than $22 million in political action committee, soft money and direct campaign donations, almost exclusively to advance the broadband legislation. The two sides have also spent many millions of dollars on teams of lobbyists, staffs of surrogate "grass-roots organizations" and floods of broadcast and newspaper advertisements.
"It's a definite irony," said Holly Bailey at the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research organization that monitors political money. "At the same time they say they are trying to curb special interests on Congress, this is a bill that is drawing a big amount of special interests out of the woodwork. A lot of checks are being mailed to members of Congress specifically following the bill."
Analysts and consumer groups that have opposed the legislation agreed.
"This is an example of squeezing the maximum money out of special interests at the same time that Congress purports to be shutting the door on special interests," said Gene Kimmelman, a senior director at Consumers Union.
The fund-raising efforts have relied on both traditional and innovative techniques. A study this week by Public Citizen found that the regional Bell companies have poured more than $277,000 into special campaign financing vehicles established by the Republican leadership in the House that supports the legislation. The vehicles, formed under a loophole in the law and known as 527 groups for a section of a tax statute, enable virtually unlimited contributions with limited disclosure and few restraints on spending.
The legislation is expected to pass by a wide margin in the House this week but faces overwhelming political obstacles in the Senate, including heavy opposition from the Republican leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi; Senator Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina, the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee; and Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska, the ranking Republican on the Senate Appropriations Committee. The administration has remained neutral in the fight, although the Federal Communications Commission, an independent agency dominated by Bush appointees, has moved to begin providing the relief the regional operating companies have sought.
For all the millions of dollars being spent in Washington over the political fight and on Madison Avenue over the advertising campaign, it is pocket change compared with the larger economic stakes at issue. The broadband market for which local and long-distance carriers are competing for high-speed data transmission is among the fastest-growing segments of a telecommunications market valued now at about $150 billion a year.
The measure would revise major sections of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which enabled the regional Bell companies to enter the long- distance market only after they demonstrated that their own local markets had been opened to sufficient competition. The companies are just beginning to obtain permission in a number of states but still face regulatory fights in others. 
Supporters say it is essential to attract new capital for further development of high-speed Internet and it would put the telephone companies on a more equal footing with the less regulated cable industry, which also offers broadband services. 
But critics counter that the measure would enable the regional Bell companies, which already dominate and in many instances monopolize their markets, to extend their reach into high-speed Internet service, driving out smaller competitors and solidifying their grip.

HEADLINE: Unions Hope to Regain Attention of Lawmakers 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Feb. 26 

 BODY:
As labor leaders gather here, they are grumbling that many of the issues that American workers care deeply about -- issues like soaring health care costs and safeguarding Social Security -- are largely absent from the nation's political dialogue, eclipsed by the war on terrorism and the Republican push for tax cuts.
 So at the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s executive council meeting, they agreed today to try to shift the nation's focus to worker-related issues. 
 They hope this strategy will highlight President Bush's political weaknesses and help elect candidates friendly to worker causes. They agreed to an assessment on the federation's 66 unions that will raise $17 million more for political efforts over the next three years. 
"There is a lack of talk this year about the issues that workers care about," said Gerald McEntee, chairman of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s political committee and president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. "This can be traced to Bush's popularity and to the war against terrorism. But the problems that existed for working people before Sept. 11 still exist. We feel it's the role of the American labor movement to put these issues on the nation's agenda."
In a resolution, the labor leaders listed issue after issue that they say political leaders should focus on: the lack of strategies to create jobs, the expiration of unemployment insurance after 26 weeks, the loss of manufacturing jobs, rising prescription costs, tax cuts that cause the government to dig into Social Security money, and fears that workers' retirement savings can be wiped out. 
These leaders point to focus groups and polls showing that while workers are concerned about the war on terrorism, how they vote will be most influenced by bread-and-butter issues and the economy.
"These working-family issues are not on the front burner," said John J. Sweeney, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. president. "I think the election this November is going to be on these very issues."
It is a difficult time for labor. Unions have been unable to reverse membership declines. They worked to elect Al Gore, but now they have a president who often takes actions hostile to labor. The recession has knocked the wind out of many unionized industries and unions.
Then there are tensions between unions. For example, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters voted against the new assessment, which will require unions to pay 4 cents more per member per month.
Michael Mathis, the Teamsters' political director, said his union opposed the assessment because the federation planned to spend some of that money on the Democratic candidate it backed for governor of Michigan, David E. Bonior, when the Teamsters favored another Democrat, Jennifer Granholm.
In addition, the Teamsters say the A.F.L.-C.I.O. leans strongly toward Democrats when the Teamsters have been strengthening ties with Republicans, working closely with them on Mr. Bush's proposal to drill for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Labor Secretary Elaine L. Chao spoke to the labor leaders today, and she urged other unions to join the Teamsters in backing Mr. Bush's energy plan.
"We need a significant number of Republicans to support us on a wide range of issues, including aggressive labor-law reform," Mr. Mathis said. "We have to build a base of support in the Republican Party. Any way you put it, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. dues increase is going to be seen as a pool of money to be used to beat Republicans."
The federation's leaders said they would focus their energies this fall on two dozen House races, a dozen Senate races and 22 governor's races, especially those in New York, California and Illinois.
Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House Democratic leader, spoke to the labor leaders this morning, asking them to help restore Democratic control of the House. But Steve Rosenthal, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s political director, hedged, saying: "We're not saying that our goal is to have a Democratic majority in the House. We want to have a pro-working-family majority in the House. But sure, we'd rather have Dick Gephardt as speaker."
Carl Forti, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, said, "I think it's great that they're supporting more Republicans, but I think there are a lot of Democrats up there who aren't worthy of their support."
For labor leaders, the Enron scandal provides ammunition against the Bush administration.
Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster, said: "Before Sept. 11, union members had a clear perception that the Bush administration had abandoned any semblance of an even playing field between workers and corporations. And now with the emergency of Enron, that perception has come back stronger than ever."

BYLINE:  By Randy Kennedy (NYT) (Compiled by Anthony Ramirez) 

 BODY:
 The city announced yesterday that the morning ban on single-occupant cars crossing into parts of Manhattan would remain through the spring. 
Iris Weinshall, the transportation commissioner, said a new study -- to be released next month -- showed that car trips had been redistributed throughout the day, easing periods of peak traffic. Garage owners, retailers and restaurant owners say the ban has hurt them and damaged the city's already weak economy. Randy Kennedy (NYT)

HEADLINE: ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: THE TRANSACTIONS; 
Enron Hid Big Loans, Data Indicate

BYLINE:  By KURT EICHENWALD 

 BODY:
Even as executives with the Enron Corporation were being privately warned last September that huge corporate debts were being hidden from investors, the company entered into a series of deals that appear to have disguised more than $350 million in new bank loans, according to internal company documents, court records and accountants.
 The transactions took place on Sept. 28, Enron's last business day before it began calculating its quarterly results, with J. P. Morgan Chase and an offshore entity, and were supposed to carry little risk. But now, with Enron in bankruptcy since early December, whether the bank will recover the full value of the money it advanced to Enron is a matter that will have to be decided in court. 
 For all outward appearances, the transactions were a series of trades intended as protection against possible future rises in the price of natural gas. But they actually served, the records show, simply to transfer hundreds of millions of dollars temporarily from J. P. Morgan to Enron, which was supposed to return the money plus a few million more in a matter of months. In essence, the transaction was a loan with an interest rate of more than 3 percent. 
The trades, while apparently following legal requirements, underscore how some of the most aggressive financing techniques used by Enron continued up to its demise. Indeed, they indicate that even after Enron disclosed to Wall Street a number of transactions that served to hide debt and increase earnings, there were still significant secrets hidden in its financial statements, yet to be revealed.
Unlike the partnership dealings, these transactions are believed by lawyers and accountants to have been reflected in Enron's financial statements. However, they allowed something that had all the earmarks of a bank loan to instead be written up as cash assets and liabilities from the company's trading business.
Vance Meyer, a spokesman for Enron, declined to comment, citing litigation involving the transactions.
Kristin Lemkau, a spokeswoman for J. P. Morgan Chase, said that the trades were a common type of transaction, known as structured finance, that would have been reflected in the financial reports of both companies, although not as loans.
The transactions "were on J. P. Morgan Chase's balance sheet and were designed to be reflected on Enron's balance sheet," she said, adding that "structured finance is used by virtually every company in America; it allows companies to lower their costs of financing and diversify their investor base."
The trades involved an offshore entity based in Jersey, in the Channel Islands, and known as Mahonia Ltd. Many earlier transactions among Enron, Morgan and Mahonia also appeared to be contracts for future purchases of natural gas, and a series of insurance companies issued guarantees that payment would be made if the commodity was not delivered. In those deals, the insurers have sued, contending that the transactions were fraudulent, and that no delivery of gas was ever intended.
The trades last fall, however, were not covered by guarantees issued by the insurers. Instead, Enron turned to Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale, known as WestLB. Enron received a letter of credit that would be paid to Mahonia and, because of the transactions, ultimately to J. P. Morgan to guarantee that Enron would meet its obligations under the trade.
All told, J. P. Morgan has exposure of $1.1 billion from the series of transactions involving Mahonia. Of that amount, $165 million is from the WestLB letter of credit that has not been paid; the remaining part of the $350 million loan was sold off to other banks.
Earlier this month, Mahonia sued WestLB in a British court, demanding payment on the letter of credit. WestLB has refused, contending that the series of three transactions among Enron, J. P. Morgan and Mahonia were simply a mechanism to hide bank loans.
"Under the right circumstances, any one of these swap transactions by itself could have been legitimate," said Fred Mauhs, a managing director with WestLB in New York. But when the parties entered into all three transactions simultaneously, he added, "the only possible purpose we can discern was to disguise a loan from Chase to Enron."
For their part, J. P. Morgan officials criticized WestLB's efforts to void the letter of credit, saying that none of the details that have emerged changed the nature of the obligation.
"WestLB's conduct is an outrageous attempt to get out of a straightforward letter of credit obligation," Ms. Lemkau, the spokeswoman, said. "It will only cause damage and uncertainty to the commercial market."
In court papers, WestLB has advanced evidence that Mahonia served no true role in the transaction. For example, the papers contain details of an interview conducted by lawyers for WestLB this year, on Feb. 5, with Joseph Deffner, an Enron executive involved in the trades. In the interview, Mr. Deffner said that to the best of his recollection, all of the negotiations about the trades with Mahonia and J. P. Morgan were conducted between Enron and the bank directly. Mahonia played no role in those talks, according to court records describing the interview.
The transactions last September involved a series of trades of a fixed value of cash for another value that floated depending on the future price of natural gas contracts. This theoretically would allow one side of the transaction to lock in a price for a quantity of natural gas, regardless of where the price for the commodity went.
The trades began between Morgan and Mahonia. Records of the trade show that the bank agreed to pay $350 million, deliverable immediately on Sept. 28, in exchange for a payment based on the variable value of gas futures contracts as of March 25 of this year, with payment due the following day.
At the same time, Mahonia entered into a transaction with Enron, with the exact same terms. As a result, the $350 million flowed on Sept. 28 from the bank to Mahonia, then from Mahonia to Enron.
The third leg of the transaction -- between J. P. Morgan and Enron -- was also created that day, documents show. Under that transaction, Enron agreed to pay Morgan a fixed obligation of about $356 million, according to court records. Meanwhile, Morgan agreed to pay Enron the variable value of the exact same number of gas contracts in the other two trades. Both cash deliveries were due on the same day, March 26.
A result of these series of trades was a circular transaction, the records indicate, in which many of the obligations created by the trade were simply canceled. Under the deal, Enron owes Mahonia a variable payment on March 26, which equals the variable payment owed by Mahonia to Morgan, which equals the variable payment owed by Morgan to Enron, all due on the same day.
Ultimately, Enron was required by the three legs to do nothing more than give the variable payment to itself. But the fixed payment is real. Morgan gave the $350 million to Mahonia, which in turn gave it to Enron on Sept. 28. Then, on March 26, Enron was supposed to pay $356 million to Morgan and owe nothing else to anyone. The payment was equivalent to the principal plus an interest payment at a rate of about 3.4 percent. At the time, that was the going rate for similar six-month loans.
The only way the variable payment would come into play would be if Enron defaulted on its obligation. Given its bankruptcy, that is now certain to happen. With Enron unable to even start the variable payment on its circular route, Mahonia hoped to be paid by the letter of credit from WestLB. That money, then, would go to J. P. Morgan to meet the variable payment obligation of Mahonia. With Enron unable to complete its trade with J. P. Morgan, the variable payment would stop there, potentially reimbursing the bank the full amount it had advanced. But with WestLB refusing to pay, that will not occur unless a court orders it.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "The Money Merry-Go-Round"Late last year, Enron and J.P. Morgan Chase engaged in a deal with a third entity that ostensbly was a hedge to protect against rising prices of natural gas. As a result of the deal, Enron counted $350 million in additional cash flow in its third-quarter financial statements. The structure of the deal, however, makes it appear to be a loan, not a hedge. Here is how the deal worked, on paper. 1. On Sept. 28, 2001, Chase paid Mahonia, an entity based in Jersey in the Channel Islands, $350 million. Mahonia agreed to pay Chase on March 26, 2002, a variable amount dependent on the price of natural gas futures contracts as of March 25. 2. The same day Mahonia struck its deal with Chase, it did the same deal with Enron, paying Enron $350 million for the same promise of a payment based on futures contracts on March 25, 2002. The net effect was that the money from Chase passed to Enron. 3. Also on the same day, Enron agreed to pay Chase $356 million on March 26, 2002, in return for a payment equal to the value of the variable payment that Chase was due from Mahonia on that day. NET EFFECT: The obligation for the variable payment passed from Enron to Mahonia to Chase and back to Enron -- a net zero. Enron ended up obligated to pay Chase $6 million more than it received on Sept. 28, 2001, the equivalent of an interest payment of about 3.4 percent on a loan. (pg. C8)

HEADLINE: ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: THE OVERVIEW; 
AN ENRON EX-CHIEF USES DEFIANT TONE AT SENATE HEARING

BYLINE:  By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. and RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 26 

 BODY:
Jeffrey K. Skilling, the former Enron chief executive, testified during a contentious hearing before a Senate panel today that he did not lie to Congress earlier this month about his role in Enron's collapse, and he criticized members of Congress for conducting their inquiry "with a complete disregard for the facts and evidence."
 Under skeptical and at times sarcastic questioning from members of both parties, Mr. Skilling defended himself against suggestions that he had tolerated or encouraged improper financial transactions at Enron. He told the panel he knew little about flawed partnership deals central to the company's collapse and insisted that the company's auditors and his subordinates had approved them. 
 At several points, Mr. Skilling, who appeared before the Senate Commerce Committee, said that Congress was engaged in a rush to political judgment that paralleled what he called similarly hasty decisions by lenders to withdraw credit from Enron when it began to falter last fall. News analysis, Page C1. 
After being battered during testimony three weeks ago before a House subcommittee, Mr. Skilling, who has been described by other Enron executives as arrogant and intimidating, repeatedly interrupted Senators to accuse them of mangling the facts or mischaracterizing testimony.
In his opening statement, he complained that Enron managers had been called "everything from hucksters to criminals" and asserted, "I have not lied to Congress or anyone else" in previous testimony. He also lectured panel members about financial matters. 
Mr. Skilling testified today alongside one of his harshest critics, Sherron S. Watkins, the Enron vice president who accused him of "duping" Enron's former chairman, Kenneth L. Lay. Jeffrey McMahon, a senior Enron executive who testified that he warned Mr. Skilling of potential problems two years ago, also appeared on the witness panel.
"I never duped Ken Lay," said Mr. Skilling, who at times appeared to glare at Ms. Watkins. "I heard Ms. Watkins testify to her opinion; I have no idea what the basis is for that opinion."
"Unlike so many others so much less fortunate than me, I am not a victim," Mr. Skilling added. "But also, unlike others, I am not one of the perpetrators, either."
Mr. Skilling, in a possible preview of his defense against lawsuits that he predicted today might strip him of $66 million generated by selling stock in the years before Enron's collapse, repeatedly said that he had relied on accountants from Arthur Andersen and hundreds of employees in Enron's internal accounting and risk-control offices for assurances that the company's financial dealings were proper. The board, he added, was well briefed in detail about the structure of partnerships that investigators say led to the company's collapse.
Mr. Skilling's most frequent refrain during the day's testimony was, "I'm not an accountant." But after one exchange in which Mr. Skilling lectured the panel at length about the ways Enron could have hedged certain assets, Senator Byron L. Dorgan, a North Dakota Democrat, said wryly, "You seem to know more about accounting and finance than you let on."
Senator Olympia Snowe, Republican of Maine, added: "You may well say that you didn't understand, you didn't know, you didn't realize or whatever. But it's such a massive scale. And I think that's the difficulty of understanding, comprehending your lack of awareness."
Much of the hearing focused on Mr. Skilling's knowledge of partnerships that had been run by Enron's former chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow. The partnerships were supposedly to be used to hedge Enron assets but, according to a report by a special committee of Enron directors, ended up concealing close to $1 billion in losses and enriching a handful of senior executives. The report was highly critical of Mr. Skilling, saying he failed to oversee controls intended to assure that the partnership dealings were proper and noting that other Enron employees believe that Mr. Skilling had greater knowledge of certain deals than he acknowledges.
Mr. Skilling says he had no inkling that the partnerships were ever used to hide debt or conceal losses, or for any other improper purpose. Unlike some other senior executives, Mr. Skilling was never an investor in the Enron partnership deals.
Ms. Watkins, who in testimony on Feb. 14 before the House subcommittee compared Mr. Skilling to a "swindler," restated her belief today that he must have known about the company's troubled finances. 
"I believe," she said, "that Mr. Andy Fastow would not have put his hands in the Enron candy jar without an explicit or implicit approval to do so by Mr. Skilling." She offered no specific evidence of her own, however, that Mr. Skilling had actually known more about the partnerships than what he had said during testimony.
While lawmakers have praised Ms. Watkins for warning Mr. Lay in August that Enron would implode in an accounting scandal, they have expressed skepticism about the account she gave the House subcommittee earlier this month that Mr. Lay was largely unaware of the company's problems.
Today, however, Ms. Watkins painted a less favorable view of Mr. Lay, pointedly stating at the outset of her testimony that she was "incredibly frustrated" that he did not fully follow through on her warnings.
"I believe that Enron had a brief window to salvage itself this past fall," she said, "and we missed that opportunity because of Mr. Lay's failure to recognize or accept that the company had manipulated its financial statements."
Senator Peter G. Fitzgerald, Republican of Illinois, asked Ms. Watkins whether she believed that Mr. Lay was "bright."
She replied, "Not after this fall."
After the hearing, Ms. Watkins's lawyer, Philip Hilder, said she had been upset about what he said were mischaracterizations of her earlier testimony that she had given "cover" to Mr. Lay by saying he was misled by subordinates and was not aware of the company's precarious finances. Today, he said, Ms. Watkins sought to emphasize that she was also very disappointed with the way Mr. Lay had handled her complaints and that "she wasn't giving cover to him or making excuses for him."
Despite the critical comments from lawmakers, Mr. Skilling's performance today contrasted with his appearance on Feb. 7 before a subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, at which he stumbled on some answers and was reduced to telling the committee, on one occasion, that he could not recall a crucial detail of a board meeting in part because the electricity had failed.
Today, Mr. Skilling appeared well coached and well prepared, and he repeatedly challenged statements by panel members about how much stock he sold in the years before Enron's collapse; the number of partnerships operated by General Electric and other companies; what Enron board minutes say about his role in overseeing the company's partnership deals; and whether Enron's financial statements properly disclosed debts carried by the company's partnerships.
In response to one question from Mr. Fitzgerald, he said, "Senator, you may be a great senator, but when it comes to understanding what happens in bankruptcy," and then he explained why he believed that the premise of the question was false. 
In a notable departure from Enron's antiregulation philosophy, Mr. Skilling urged lawmakers to do something about the speed with which creditors, investment partners and other entities dealing with Enron cut the company off financially when its problems became apparent last fall. He cited widespread use of "material adverse change" clauses in derivatives deals and other financial arrangements that allow investors to pull their money out immediately. He suggested that such clauses helped lead to a "run on the bank" that brought Enron down as it lost access to financing just when it needed it most. 
Perhaps mindful of Enron's aggressive efforts in the past in lobbying to eliminate or avoid regulation of derivatives, energy contracts and other transactions critical to Enron's business, the Senate panel was clearly skeptical of Mr. Skilling's policy recommendations. "I'll get advice on what we ought to do in the future from others," Mr. Dorgan said.
One of his most persistent questioners, Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, played a videotape of what she said was a 1999 employee meeting at which Mr. Skilling smiles and nods his head after another Enron executive asks whether employees should put all their 401(k) retirement money into Enron stock. Many Enron employees lost the bulk of their savings when Enron's stock collapsed, where they had, on average, invested about 60 percent of their 401(k) money. Those losses are the focus of several of the Congressional inquiries. Senior Enron officials sold more than $1 billion in stock in the years before Enron's collapse.
"Why is it that you had begun unloading your stock pretty heavily before that date and yet led the employees to think they should keep buying stock?" Ms. Boxer asked Mr. Skilling.
In response, Mr. Skilling, referring to her as "Ms. Senator," later said that he followed a program of selling modest amounts of Enron stock over many months. 
Later, Mr. Dorgan asked Mr. Skilling about a North Dakota Enron employee whose $330,000 retirement plan dwindled to $1,700. "You still have most of your $66 million. That family has lost their life savings. How do we reconcile that?" Mr. Dorgan asked. "How is it that the people at the top got wealthy and the people at the bottom got broke?"
Mr. Skilling replied: "I think, if I thought that there was a concern, I would imagine any economic adviser would say, 'You probably should have sold more, diversified more.' And I think it's very tough. I mean, I don't know what to say to the employees."
In his comments today, Mr. McMahon, who is now the company's president and chief operating officer, repeated earlier testimony that in March 2000 he met with Mr. Skilling to tell him that Enron finance employees were subjected daily to conflicts of interest because they negotiated against partnerships headed by their boss, Mr. Fastow. Several weeks later, Mr. McMahon said he transferred to a different job within the company after Mr. Fastow confronted him over the meeting with Mr. Skilling. 
Mr. Skilling, who asserted his testimony was not "materially different" from Mr. McMahon's, said he recalled Mr. McMahon's complaining not about how the partnerships could affect shareholders, but about whether it would affect his compensation.
Mr. Skilling also said he had "talked to Mr. Fastow and put him on notice that there had been a complaint, and then I expected him to deal with it."
In response to a question about the shredding of documents at Enron that is being investigated by the F.B.I., Mr. McMahon said, "I don't believe we do know what records were destroyed."

HEADLINE: Bush Urges Work and Marriage Programs in Welfare Plan 

BYLINE:  By ROBIN TONER and ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 26 

 BODY:
Declaring that the 1996 welfare overhaul was a resounding success in ending generations of welfare dependency, President Bush called today for even stronger work requirements and $300 million annually to promote marriage and strengthen families among poor people.
 Mr. Bush formally unveiled his welfare plan today beneath a huge sign that declared, "Working Toward Independence," before an audience of community activists in St. Luke's Catholic Church in Southeast Washington. His remarks were vintage compassionate conservatism, a blend of tough talk about the virtues of work and gentle vows that, "We will not leave people in need to their own struggle, and we will not leave them to their own fate." Even as he denounced much of the war on poverty, he hailed Hubert H. Humphrey, one of its staunchest advocates. 
 Critics said that states would have great difficulty meeting Mr. Bush's new work standards, which would mandate that 70 percent of all welfare recipients in a state be working by 2007. Right now, administration officials said, the typical state has 30 percent of its welfare cases working. Critics also asserted the Bush plan would not give states the flexibility they need to design programs that reflect their local economic conditions and their caseloads.
As expected, Mr. Bush combined his tougher work requirements with a nod to those who assert that poor people need more education and training to move beyond the lowest paying jobs. He said welfare recipients, under his proposal, would be required to spend 40 hours a week in work, but added that up to two of those work days could be spent on education and training. Under current law, adults are typically required to work 30 hours a week, a third of which could be in education or training, but critics assert there is much more flexibility.
The Bush proposal would also allow three months of full-time drug rehabilitation or job training "for people who need intensive short-term help," the president said. And it would preserve the current law's five-year ban on welfare benefits for immigrants who entered the country after 1996 and have not become citizens.
Mr. Bush, forshadowing the political debate to come, argued that it was the focus on work that explained why the 1996 law "dramatically improved" the lives of poor people, after 30 years of a welfare system that became "an enemy of individual effort and responsibility, with dependence passed from one generation to the next."
Mr. Bush presented his proposals to strengthen marriages and families, which critics assert is an inappropriate realm for the government, as a way to help children. "Across America, no doubt about it, single mothers do heroic work," he said. "They have the toughest job in our country." But he added, "In many cases, their lives and their children's lives would be better if their fathers had lived up to their responsibilities."
The administration, confronting an out-of-wedlock birth rate that has stabilized but remains a stubborn 33 percent of all births, is hoping to turn the tide by financing experimental programs in the states, like public education campaigns on the benefits of marriage and premarital counseling. 
Mr. Bush also made the case today for his proposed $135 million for abstinence education, also part of his welfare plan. "Abstinence is the surest way and the only completely effective way to prevent unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases," he said. "When our children face a choice between self-restraint and self-destruction, government should not be neutral."
The Bush proposals were hailed by Republican Congressional leaders. But the Bush plan is only the opening bid in a lengthy legislative process that will culminate in the reauthorization and rewriting of the 1996 law, much of which expires this year.
Tommy G. Thompson, the secretary of health and human services, discussed the administration's proposal today at an exceptionally cordial meeting on Capitol Hill with governors and members of Congress from both parties.
Democratic reaction was mixed. Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, said he could accept stricter work requirements, provided the standards could be relaxed or adjusted in bad economic times. "You have to be very careful," Mr. Kerry said. 
Other Democrats also expressed concern. Two of the party's experts on welfare policy, Representatives Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland and Sander M. Levin of Michigan, said the work requirements in the president's plan were so strict that they would encourage states to put welfare recipients in publicly subsidized jobs with little hope of career advancement.
"In effect," Mr. Cardin said, "the administration would force states to put people in unpaid workfare positions in order to satisfy the work requirement, rather than providing the skills necessary for a person to be successful in a wage-earning job."
Others worried about the availability of child care for single mothers trying to meet those work requirements. Marian Wright Edelman, president of the Children's Defense Fund, a liberal group that strenuously opposed enactment of the 1996 law, also criticized Mr. Bush's proposals today. "The president requires more hours of work, but not one dime more for child care," Mrs. Edelman said. "Right now only one in seven children eligible for federal child care assistance gets it."

HEADLINE: Bloomberg and Pataki Say Rebuilding of Downtown Should Wait for Overall Plan 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Gov. George E. Pataki suggested yesterday that a Manhattan developer should not go ahead with construction at 7 World Trade Center until completion of an overall development plan for Lower Manhattan.
 The remarks contrast with recent signals from state and city officials on the pace of rebuilding Lower Manhattan. They also cast further doubt on the hopes of the developer, Larry A. Silverstein, the real estate executive who owns the development rights to the World Trade Center complex, to begin construction soon on a replacement for 7 World Trade Center. 
 Mr. Silverstein has said that he hopes to begin building at the 7 World Trade Center site by June. The site lies just north of the former main complex of trade center buildings, across Vesey Street. The chairman of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, John C. Whitehead, said last week that he felt it was desirable for a new building at 7 World Trade Center "to proceed promptly." 
But Mr. Bloomberg said to reporters yesterday morning that any such effort should proceed slowly, and that people affected by the attack on Sept. 11 and by the redevelopment of the area south of Chambers Street should first have adequate opportunities to express their views about a memorial, transportation, buildings and other changes downtown.
Asked about the mayor's remarks and their conflict with those of Mr. Whitehead, who was appointed by Mr. Pataki, Mollie Fullington, a spokeswoman for the governor, said Mr. Pataki "believes we should move forward in an appropriate time frame consistent with an overall vision for the redevelopment of downtown."
The confusion over multiple lines of authority at the World Trade Center site has left many interested parties unsure where to turn. "Obviously there is a tremendous amount of public concern about 7 World Trade," said Robert D. Yaro, president of the Regional Plan Association. 
Because Mr. Silverstein holds the lease on the property, which is owned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, it is not clear whether Mr. Bloomberg has any true power over what happens there. Although the mayor controls 4 of the 11 seats on the board of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, those board members were appointed by his predecessor, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. Mr. Bloomberg's aides have said, however, that the four directors serve at his pleasure.
Howard J. Rubenstein, a spokesman for Mr. Silverstein, said yesterday that Mr. Silverstein "is seeking to work cooperatively with the mayor, the governor, the Port Authority and the community on issues involving new construction." He declined to comment directly on Mr. Bloomberg's remarks, but added that Mr. Silverstein "is seeking to build as expeditiously as possible."
Support for Mr. Silverstein's quick rebuilding of 7 World Trade Center had appeared to extend to state officials, if not to the governor himself. Charles A. Gargano, a Pataki appointee who is the state's chief economic development executive, said earlier this month that he supported Mr. Silverstein's plans to begin rebuilding in June. Mr. Gargano is chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, the parent organization of the Lower Manhattan group, and vice chairman of the Port Authority.
Mr. Bloomberg had previously said little regarding the speed of development at the site, although he had expressed support for a mixed-use plan, including a memorial, office buildings and perhaps stores and a cultural center.
Speaking yesterday during an event at the William O'Shea Middle School on West 77th Street, Mr. Bloomberg said, "I don't know that you can go any faster than what you're doing right now, nor do I think it is appropriate. So I certainly would recommend stalling a little while longer. I think over the summer, you'll start to see people be able to sit down and look at a more comprehensive plan."
Asked if that meant that a plan should precede any construction, Mr. Bloomberg added: "I think the first thing is the recovery effort. The second thing is giving everybody a chance to talk, and then, yes, you should not go build any one building without a plan."
Residents of Lower Manhattan have pushed for a delay in the construction of any buildings, saying they want a comprehensive plan that will lay out what happens at the 16 acres formerly occupied by the World Trade Center as well as in the surrounding neighborhoods. 
Members of the families of victims also advocate going slowly, in part because some of them want the entire 16-acre site to be a memorial to the victims. 
Con Edison, meanwhile, wants to start rebuilding the electrical substations that were in 7 World Trade Center, which were destroyed when that building collapsed on Sept. 11. 
Mr. Silverstein's desire to build is tied to the fact that he is continuing to make lease payments on the World Trade Center site while not getting any money from it. Because Mr. Silverstein is currently using insurance money to make lease payments to the Port Authority, some politicians would also like him to proceed, in part so he cannot make a legal claim that the city or the state is hindering him from operating his business.
Some of Mr. Silverstein's supporters have said that starting a new project would send a strong signal to the world that the city -- and the nation -- were recovering from the attacks. But Daniel Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development, said yesterday, "I don't think we need to send signals that downtown is coming back."
Speaking at a breakfast forum sponsored by Crain's New York Business, Mr. Doctoroff said that development of Lower Manhattan should include a redesigned transportation hub that could include the re-establishment of streets that were removed for the construction of the World Trade Center.
