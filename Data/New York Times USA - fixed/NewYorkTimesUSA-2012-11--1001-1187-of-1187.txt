HEADLINE: State to Hire Jobless for Storm Cleanup

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN

 BODY:
New York State will hire more than 5,000 unemployed residents in temporary positions to help clean up debris and distribute supplies in areas stricken by Hurricane Sandy, the Cuomo administration announced on Sunday. 
The jobs will pay roughly $15 an hour and could last as long as six months. They will be available to residents in the communities that were most affected by the storm, including areas of New York City, Long Island and the Lower Hudson Valley.
State officials said that hiring would be focused on young people as well as the long-term unemployed, and that the positions would be financed by a grant of nearly $28 million from the federal government.
"The enormous amount of work to be done gives us a chance to provide young and unemployed New Yorkers with job opportunities cleaning up their communities," Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said in a statement.
Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, added that the jobs would "provide valuable work experience and on-the-job training that can be useful in future careers."
To be eligible for the positions, prospective workers must be unemployed, at least 18 and live on Long Island, in the five boroughs of New York City or in Orange, Putnam, Rockland, Sullivan, Ulster or Westchester Counties. Residents can apply for jobs by calling 1-888-469-7365 or by filling out an online form.
The state labor commissioner, Peter M. Rivera, said on Sunday that 800 people had already signed up for temporary jobs as part of the program. Some were scheduled to begin working as early as Monday.
"We need to get the word out as quickly as we can," Mr. Rivera said.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency is also starting a separate program to hire New Yorkers to replace agency employees, many of them from out of state, who have been working in the region since the hurricane struck. The agency said Sunday that upward of 700 positions would be available as part of its program.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: In Delhi, a 'Sand Hill Road' for Cheap Health Care

BYLINE: JYOTI PANDE LAVAKARE


HIGHLIGHT: On "MedTech Row," entrepreneurs create new health care products and services for the poor. 

 BODY:
You've probably heard of Sand Hill Road, home to Silicon Valley's venture capitalists, who changed the way the tech industry did business. You probably haven't heard of New Delhi's MedTech Row, but the innovators and entrepreneurs who work here are no less ambitious in attempting to transform the health care industry.
Not far from the historic Qutab Minar monument in the Indian capital, a whole ecosystem of health and medical technology innovators and entrepreneurs specializing in "affordable health care" has sprung up. These newcomers are focused on developing technology to provide better health care to poor people and those with limited access to medical services, while, for the most part, making a profit at the same time.
"India is a hotbed of innovation," said Elizabeth Bailey, director of the Consortium for Affordable Medical Technologies, or CAMTech, in a phone interview from Boston. The consortium is planning to set up an "innovation laboratory" to test low-cost medical technology on MedTech Row. 
CAMTech's members include the Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, the Medical Electronic Device Realization Center at M.I.T. and Indian research foundations like the Lata Medical Research Foundation and the Vellore Institute of Technology. The aim, Ms. Bailey said, is to find low-cost solutions in collaboration with the people who need them the most. "Ultimately, we would like to help health workers to work smarter and harder," Ms. Bailey said.
MedTech Row is defined geographically by an enclave of the Qutub Institutional Area, which borders the Indian Institute of Technology's biomedical engineering department to the south and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences to the north. Between these venerable Indian institutions, several companies and partnerships have their offices clustered around Jawaharlal Nehru University's campus, with their focal point the offices of the government's Department of Science and Technology.
This is the area where the nonprofit health giants like Program for Appropriate Technology in Health, or PATH, Public Health Foundation, the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation have offices.
Partnerships and for-profit companies have also set up shop here. For example, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, which is likely to be the final testing ground of most of MedTech Row's innovations, is currently also home to the Stanford India Biodesign program, a collaboration of the institute, Stanford University and Delhi's I.I.T. The program is training a new generation of Indian medical technology innovators between Stanford and New Delhi. And the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Sequoia Capital has an office here.
This new focus on low-cost health care should come as no surprise, given the size and growth of the market. Private sector annual revenues in "affordable health care" are estimated at upto $20 billion in India alone, according to Jasjit Mangat, director of investment at Omidyar Network, the philanthropic investment fund of the eBay founder Pierre Omidyar.
That figure is a fraction of India's total $105 billion in estimated health care industry revenues, including water, sanitation, drugs and health insurance.
In 2011, Fitch Ratings projected that India's health care industrywill double to $100 billion by 2015, thanks to an increasing population, lifestyle-related diseases, growing incomes, greater penetration of insurance and medical tourism. So it isn't surprising that new health and medical start-ups are popping up in every part of India.
Med-tech parks are also springing up in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, and there are a host of innovation labs and training centers for entrepreneurs and community health workers in various stages of development.
But in northern India, it is here, on MedTech Row where the buzz is the loudest, thanks to the concentration of government, private, nonprofit and for-profit entrepreneurial partnerships. Suddenly, it seems you can't go to a social gathering in New Delhi today without bumping into an affordable health care or public health professional.
The affordable health care sector has caught the interest of every category of financier - from angel investors to commercial venture capital companies to philanthropic or "social venture" capitalists - who are looking at the entire spectrum of developments in the industry, from medical devices to the delivery of low-cost health care.
"We're very bullish about this sector," said Ritesh Banglani, director of Helion Ventures Partners, a $605 million India-focused venture fund that has offices in Gurgaon and Bangalore. The fund is particularly interested in specialist outpatient consulting and emergency care for low-income consumers in smaller Indian cities and towns, he said.
Mr. Banglani said that any innovation that helps simplify and integrate medical procedures or even standardize administrative processes can help in bringing down health care costs. "Freeing up a doctor's time to allow him to focus on the patient isn't rocket science. Just streamlining basic processes can dramatically improve efficiencies," he said.
Mr. Banglani also said that the health care industry, by taking advantage of India's low-cost engineering and low-cost manufacturing to re-engineer standard technologies, can further cut costs. Innovations in these areas improve efficiencies, which are among the things he looks for when considering investments in health care companies.
While the term "affordable healthcare" may seem a bit vague -- after all, who wants unaffordable health care? -- the industry has strict parameters, say investors and innovators. They define the affordable health care sector as low-cost medical services designed for the 835 million people in India living at the bottom of the economic pyramid - those earning less than 250 rupees ($4.50) per day.
To date, private sector participation in the affordable health care sector has been low, with the government taking on the major share of spending. But start-ups in India have begun to churn out prototypes and pilot projects aimed at this market, from inexpensive, life-saving, portable ventilators, to fecal incontinence devices to multi-use diagnostic and drug delivery devices that allow biopsies and targeted fine-needle drug delivery.
The government's latest health insurance plan designed for the poor, spearheaded by the Labor Ministry bureaucrat Anil Swarup, is also providing a boost to the industry. The Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana program, which relies on a cashless, portable smart card, has already enrolled 110 million people.
In this plan, the government pays 750 rupees to insurance companies per year for each family of five who can't afford their own insurance. The family, in turn, is covered for annual medical costs of up 30,000 rupees. Costs for medical procedures for these families are fixed by the government, and hospitals involved need to become more efficient to make profits, so affordable health care has become a priority.
"We can't think of a more important sector with greater social impact than affordable health care in India," said Mr. Mangat of the Omidyar Network.

HEADLINE: Black Man's Burden

BYLINE: DAYO OLOPADE


HIGHLIGHT: In a clever satire of international aid, a Norwegian NGO calls for Africans to send radiators to its frostbitten people. 

 BODY:
Watch on Youtube.
CHICAGO - "Africans unite to save Norwegians from dying of frostbite." That's the tagline of the fictional fundraising campaign "Radi-Aid." The campaign, supposedly sponsored by concerned Africans, comes with all the trappings of the charity industry: snapshots of the suffering, branded T-shirts and an uplifting music video. The associated song - all vibrato and platitudes - asks Africans to collect and send radiators to the northern hemisphere. 
"Why should we ignore cold people?" asks the fictional rapper Breezy V. "People don't ignore starving people, so why should we ignore cold people? Frostbite kills too." 
The video comes from the Norwegian Students' and Academics' International Assistance Fund, a development organization in Norway that deploys funding and technical assistance to young people in Zambia, Zimbabwe and South Africa as well as Bolivia and Nicaragua. Its comedy, of course, is that Norway consistently tops global rankings of human development (and that the African chorus in the video struggles with the cold). The tragedy is that even if the worst conventions of development assistance can be mocked, they still persist.
Plenty of ink has been spilled over the pitfalls and pratfalls of aid to Africa and other less developed regions of the world. The Nigerian-American author Teju Cole updated the phrase the "white man's burden" to the "white savior industrial complex," an accurate descriptor for philanthropic cluelessness and waste, like ineffectual condom-distribution drives in India or "buy-one-give-one" shoe-selling schemes. 
The Radi-Aid video a play on Live Aid, a seminal musical aid campaign pokes fun at the very process of international charity. It makes the shrewd viewer ask: Who will receive the donations? What if the radiators break? Is this a long-term strategy to fight frostbite? Is frostbite the core problem anyway?
This is a smart way to question whether assistance to populations in Africa - in the form of pharmaceuticals or water wells or even underwear - is more about making donors look good than about doing good for the needy.
Some of the incentives for bad aid are built in. Most charities must flog for funding to stay afloat, which creates a market for proof of suffering rather than proof of strength. Well-fed and well-schooled young people in poor countries don't sell T-shirts. 
Some of the incentives are purely emotional. For the privileged, it feels great to host a food drive for a distant crisis. But sending gifts in kind - like old clothing, canned goods or radiators - can be counterproductive. In the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy in the United States, for example, the Red Cross and other relief agencies reminded would-be altruists to send cash rather than diapers, clothes and preserved food to allow local responders to buy the items that were most needed.
The same logic applies to African economies. Local procurement could help blunt the economic impact of a humanitarian crisis, but more often foreign assistance ignores this by design. During the 1983-85 famine in Ethiopia that launched Live Aid, the planes full of grain that were sent from the West to hungry populations undermined East African food producers.
Aid campaigns implicitly promise guilt reduction and ego inflation for donors. The grinning Radi-Aid singers perform the same sleight of hand, selling scenes of snow, and their own exuberance, as a reason to pitch in. 
More subtly, the video recalls "Kony 2012," a slick short film produced by Americans about the Lord's Resistance Army in Uganda that broke records for viral views. The film is the most recent and prominent of Africa-framing fictions produced by nonprofit organizations. Some call the genre "poverty porn," others call it marketing. Whatever the name, it relies on giving a narrow impression of a person or place from a vast, diverse continent. Such "assistance" turns extraordinary hardship into an ordinary event and ignores the ordinary folks just getting by, or better.
The Radi-Aid stunt parries this trend effectively. Its creators remind viewers of the limited portrait they are painting. The site asks: "Imagine if every person in Africa saw the 'Africa for Norway' video and this was the only information they ever got about Norway. What would they think about Norway?"
They would think Norway is cold. (I hear that it is.) But it is other things as well.

BYLINE: ASHLEY SOUTHALL


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times and around the Web, plus a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
 In Today's Times: 
With Congress returning today to dive into discussions about a deal to avert a year-end fiscal crisis, President Obama is rallying his army of supporters to press Republicans into accepting a plan that includes higher taxes on the wealthy, Michael D. Shear writes. After his supporters largely stayed away from the raucous health care debates of 2009, President Obama and his aides hope that a nascent e-mail and social media campaign will mobilize voters, especially in important states. 
Lesbian Republicans, also known as "unicorns," are joining their more visible male counterparts to fight the stereotype that all gays and lesbians are Democrats, Sarah Wheaton writes. Among them are women like Kathryn Lehman, an attorney who helped write the federal law banning gay marriage, who is now working to overturn it.
Military planners are drawing up plans for a contingency of American and allied forces to remain in Afghanistan after the United States and NATO withdraw troops in 2014. But Michael Gordon explains that the planners, in trying to meet the deadline, have run up against challenges like how to compensate for Afghanistan's limited airpower and lack of medical facilities.
 Around the Web: 
Despite a consensus among Congressional negotiators that higher taxes should be part of a deal to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff at the end of the year, lawmakers remain far apart on the details of how taxes should go up and who should pay, according to the Washington Post.
On the Sunday talk shows, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a Republican policy heavyweight, said he would be willing to violate an anti-tax pledge to avert a fiscal crisis. The clip is among the seven top talking points from yesterday's shows, as compiled by the Daily Beast.
 Happening in Washington: 
Timing for Cyber Monday, the White Househas released a report by the president's economic advisers predicting how a spike in tax rates at the end of the year would affect retailers and consumers if Congress does not act to extend the current lower rates.
Congress returns from its Thanksgiving break today, with the Senate convening at 2 p.m.
Around 10 a.m., the Capitol Christmas tree is expected to arrive on the west front lawn of the Capitol. It will be lit from nightfall until 11 p.m. each evening through Dec. 26. 
At 11 a.m., John Morton, the federal director of Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, will announce the names of Web sites seized by the agency for selling counterfeit goods to unsuspecting holiday shoppers.

HEADLINE: White House Sees Stunted Growth if Tax Cuts Expire

BYLINE: PETER BAKER


HIGHLIGHT: Americans could spend nearly $200 billion less next year on cars, clothes, furniture and other consumer products than they would otherwise if automatic tax increases take effect as currently scheduled, according to a White House report. 

 BODY:
Americans could spend nearly $200 billion less next year on cars, clothes, furniture and other consumer products than they would otherwise if automatic tax increases take effect as currently scheduled, the White House warned in a report issued Monday morning. 
Such a crimp on demand would curb the growth of real consumer spending by 1.7 percentage points in 2013 and slow the growth of the overall economy by 1.4 percentage points, according to the report prepared by the President's Council of Economic Advisers.
The report focused entirely on the impact of Bush-era tax cuts expiring for middle-class taxpayers at the end of the year and a failure to adjust the Alternative Minimum Tax so that it does not suddenly apply to millions of taxpayers who have not paid it in the past. It made no effort to look at the economic impact of deep military and domestic spending cuts also due to take effect in the new year.
 A $200 billion decline in consumer spending would be the equivalent of four times what Americans spent on Black Friday weekend last year, or roughly what Americans spent on all new cars and trucks sold in the United States in the last year, the report said. The scaled back spending would stretch across sectors from groceries and gasoline to health care and recreation.
The report was broadly consistent with a similar study of the effects of the so-called fiscal cliff released by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office earlier this month. The White House released it as part of an effort to turn up the pressure on Congress, which has barely a month to reach an agreement with President Obama on how to avoid the tax and spending changes or risk sending the nation back into recession.

HEADLINE: Following Up With Dan Brown, Inventor of the Bionic Wrench

BYLINE: GENE MARKS


HIGHLIGHT: If he had it to do over, what would Mr. Brown do differently? 

 BODY:
 Editor's Note: Gene Marks's weekly roundup of small-business news will return next Monday. 
Two weeks ago in my Dashboard roundup, I linked to this story about Dan Brown and his patent fight with Sears over his Bionic Wrench. As you may recall, Mr. Brown gave Sears the exclusive right to sell his patented, award-winning, made-in-America tool, and it sold quite well last Christmas. This year, however, Sears has introduced a competing, less-expensive version of the tool that is made in China.
I went back to Mr. Brown, who teaches industrial design at Northwestern University and who has already enjoyed one outpouring of support on this blog, whether he has had further thoughts about how he handled his invention and what he might have done differently. 
 Q. 
 Do you think the government should change patent laws to better protect small businesses? If so, what changes would you suggest? 
 A. 
Yes, we definitely need some changes if our country is ever going to protect our significant investments in innovation. Most people do not know it, but we have a double standard in the protection and punishment of intellectual property theft. Without going into all of the detail, the punishment for willful copyright and trademark infringement is a criminal penalty. This is a very strong deterrent for copyright and trademark infringement. The punishment for willful patent infringement is a civil case and not a criminal case. As it stands today, this piracy model for patent theft allows infringers to proceed unchecked for years in the marketplace, often destroying the market, business, and investment of the patent rights owner. The current system forces the victim to fight a protracted and expensive legal battle. If Congress were to simply make those cases of willful patent infringement a criminal case, and we began holding the responsible individuals and officers of the companies personally accountable -- as it is in willful infringement of copyrights and trademarks -- I believe these infringers would think long and hard before they risked infringing a patented product.
 Q. 
 What advice would you offer others who find themselves in the same situation? 
 A. 
My general advice to inventor-entrepreneurs is to be sure you have good intellectual property, and that you have designed your product so that it has created new value and many competitive advantages for your customers.
 Q. 
Would it make more sense for you to ignore Sears and instead invest your time and effort into competing with them by selling your wrench to other outlets?
 A. 
We did not commit our lives to this project only to have it stolen from us without a fight. Not being able to fight for our rights and win is exactly what the piracy model is counting on.
 Q. 
 Will it be easy to replace the business from Sears? 
 A. 
Sure, how many truckloads do you want to buy? Of course, we are aggressively pursuing other opportunities. Unfortunately, the sales cycle in this business runs well ahead of the delivery cycle. Pioneering a new product into a retailer is very challenging, especially when attempting to convince a buyer whose paradigm is almost totally based on purchasing imported products at very low costs. That is why we worked so hard with Sears to prove the viability of the product and sales program.
 Q. 
 Given the low cost of manufacturing elsewhere in the world, why did you choose to manufacture in the United States? 
 A. 
Ironically, I have been called crazy for trying to make a product in this category in the U.S. I can understand why some people think this; we certainly did not take the easy path with the Bionic Wrench. We are also committed to doing the right thing socially. Again, this may sound crazy for a businessperson to recognize that he has a social responsibility beyond his need to create and sustain a business. However, this is precisely why we chose to produce the Bionic Wrench in the States. What drives this passion in me is that I was raised by blue-collar parents, who worked extremely hard to provide a decent life for our family. We did not have a lot of money, and we were not raised to value money higher than ethics. We were raised to do the right thing.
 Q. 
 If cheaper products can be made elsewhere that benefit the American consumer, why not let the marketplace decide? 
 A. 
The right thing to do is to enforce innovation rights. These rights create jobs, economic benefits and profits for our society, while our patent-piracy tolerance destroys the economic benefits we seek. If a product like ours -- a patented, award-winning innovation and an American-made business model -- is destroyed by the cannibalistic capitalism of our marketplace, what products can survive to create jobs in our society? Simply, if we cannot produce innovative products domestically, what products can we produce domestically?
 Q. 
 How has this experience affected you emotionally and physically? 
 A. 
I do not wish this experience on anyone. I have devoted 10-plus years of my life to this project. This is the single most deplorable ethical and business situation I have been in, and I have been working in business for over 30 years. Emotionally, I am mad, and physically I am ready to fight.

HEADLINE: Congressional Proposal Could Create 'Bubble' in Tax Code

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: One proposal being floated as an alternative to raising the top marginal rate would place its heaviest tax burden on the somewhat wealthy as opposed to the very wealthy. 

 BODY:
The coming Congressional debate over fiscal policy is sure to feature a wide array of proposals, some of which would hit certain taxpayers harder than others.
But one idea being floated by Congressional negotiators, as described in an article by The New York Times's Jonathan Weisman on Thursday, is hard to defend from the standpoint of rational public policy making.
Its arithmetic could require that the 300,000th dollar of income was taxed at a rate of about 50 percent - even while the three millionth dollar of income, or the three billionth, was taxed at a lower 35 percent rate instead.
The math behind these calculations is not all that complicated. It's just a matter of understanding how marginal tax rates work. 
Take an American who earns $400,000 a year in taxable income. (This is roughly the threshold at which a taxpayer reaches the top 1 percent of households.)
The top marginal federal income tax rate is now 35 percent, and kicks in at earnings above $388,350.
Someone making $400,000 is above the $388,350 threshold. Does this mean that she'd be taxed at a 35 percent rate on all $400,000 of income, meaning that she'd owe the government $140,000?
Not under current law. Instead, only a small fraction of the taxpayer's income - the $11,650 she earns after she's already reached $388,350 - is taxed at the top 35 percent rate.
This is because the tax rates are applied on a marginal basis. For every dollar that a taxpayer earns up to $8,700, she owes the federal government 10 cents in taxes - regardless of how much money she makes thereafter.
The government then taxes 15 cents of every dollar once the taxpayer reaches $8,701 in income, and continuing until she has earned $35,350. There are several more steps in the scale until the taxpayer reaches the top marginal rate.
Because tax rates are applied in this way, a taxpayer making $400,000 would owe about $117,000 in federal taxes, or about 29 percent of her earnings - rather than $140,000 if all her income had been taxed at the 35 percent rate.
Under the proposal described in Mr. Weisman's article, that would change.
"One possible change would tax the entire salary earned by those making more than a certain level - $400,000 or so - at the top rate of 35 percent rather than allowing them to pay lower rates before they reach the target, as is the standard formula," he reports.
In other words, under this proposal, the taxpayer making $400,000 would in fact pay 35 percent in overall income taxes and would owe $140,000 - about $23,000 more than she does currently.
The question is when the government would collect the additional $23,000 of taxes.
The most theoretically extreme case is if the government collected all of the additional taxes when the taxpayer made her 400,000th dollar of income exactly. That is, the taxpayer would owe about $117,000 in taxes if she made $399,999, but $140,000 if she made $400,000 instead. Thus, that one additional dollar of income would cost the taxpayer about $23,000 in taxes.
Of course, the government might never see the money, since the taxpayer might do everything in her power to avoid crossing the $400,000 threshold.
Here's the problem: the government would now want to collect 35 percent of the taxpayer's overall income, when it had been billing her at a lower rate on almost all the income she had earned so far.
If the government simply started collecting 35 percent of every dollar she earned above a certain threshold, it would have no way to make up for the lower rates it had been charging her previously.
Instead, it needs to make up the deficit somewhere to collect that additional $23,000 of taxes. It can only accomplish that by making the tax rate greater than 35 percent on at least some of the income that she has received.
For example, the taxpayer might be asked to pay additional taxes on the $150,000 of earnings between $250,000 and $400,000. To collect the extra $23,000, the government would need to tax this income at a rate of about 15 percent - in addition to the marginal tax rates that are already applied under current law, which now range between 33 and 35 percent.
Thus, the taxpayer would owe close to 50 percent in federal income taxes on earnings between $250,000 and $400,000. (If state taxes and Medicare taxes are also considered, her marginal tax rate could be close to 60 percent in some states.)
Perhaps you think that someone earning $300,000 or $400,000 should be taxed much more than they are now. There is still a perversity introduced by this proposal.
Specifically, after the taxpayer had hit her 400,000th dollar of income, her marginal tax rate would then decline. Rather than owing 50 cents for each dollar earned, she'd be back to a 35 percent rate instead.
Suppose that the taxpayer is considering taking on a part-time job that would make her an additional $50,000 in income. If the taxpayer had already earned $3,000,000 in income from her main job, then she would be able to keep 65 percent of the additional income from her side gig, owing 35 percent or $17,500 in taxes.
But if the taxpayer had "only" made $300,000 from her main job, she would get to keep only about $25,000 of earnings from her second job, owing the other $25,000 to the government. Faced with this steep tax rate, the taxpayer might decline the second job, meaning that the government would never collect the additional revenues from her earnings.
This is what's known as a "tax bubble": when someone earning less income might be taxed at a higher marginal rate than someone making more.
Tax bubbles have existed at various times in the federal tax code, such as from 1986 through 1990. They also exist in some state tax codes. But the proposal described in Mr. Weisman's article would create an especially steep one.
To be clear, the people subjected to the tax bubble would be reasonably well off. An average family making $50,000 a year would not pay any additional taxes because of it, nor would its incentives be distorted in any substantial way.
Also to be clear: many of the people writing about tax policy, from academic economists to yours truly, make incomes that are considerably above the national average.
Nonetheless, the proposal described in Mr. Weisman's article would place its heaviest tax burden on the somewhat wealthy as opposed to the very wealthy, particularly as it is being proposed as an alternative to raising the top marginal rate.
If the tax bubble were implemented, but the tax code were otherwise unchanged, then someone making $400,000 would owe $140,000 in federal income taxes, $23,000 more than she does now, increasing her overall tax rate to 35 percent from about 29 percent. 
Someone making $4 million would owe $1.4 million in taxes, also reflecting a $23,000 increase. But the increase would be minimal on a percentage basis, since it comes from a larger pool of income. Their overall tax rate would rise to 35.0 percent from 34.4 percent.
If, instead, the top two marginal tax rates were increased to 36 percent and 39.6 percent, as they were under the Clinton administration, then someone making $400,000 would owe about $124,000 in federal income taxes - or about 31 percent of her income. This would reflect a tax increase, but less than under the tax bubble proposal.
However, the government would collect more taxes from the $4 million earner. Someone making that much would owe $1.55 million if the Clinton-era rates were restored, with their tax rate rising to 38.7 percent from 34.4 percent.
Either policy would reflect a tax increase - whatever semantics the Congress might use to describe it. It's a question of which taxpayers would bear more of the burden.
It's also a question of whether the tax increase would make the tax code more efficient or less so. One might favor a flatter schedule of marginal tax rates or a steeper one. All taxes have the potential to discourage work. But smoother increases in marginal tax rates, as
under current law, create less economic friction, and fewer deadweight losses, then those with a number of peaks and valleys. It is hard to see the economic rationale for creating a bubble in the middle of the tax code.

HEADLINE: Mortgage Interest Deduction, Once a Sacred Cow, Is Under Scrutiny

BYLINE: PETER EAVIS


HIGHLIGHT: As President Obama and Congress scrape for ways to raise tax revenue without hurting middle-income families or pushing up rates, the mortgage interest deduction may be part of the discussion. 

 BODY:
A tax break that has long been untouchable could soon be in for some serious scrutiny.
Many home buyers deduct their mortgage interest when assessing their tax bill, a perk that has helped bolster the income of millions of families - and the broader housing market.
But as President Obama and Congress try to hash out a deal to reduce the budget deficit, the mortgage interest deduction will likely be part of the discussion. 
 Limits on a broad array of deductions could emerge in any budget deal. It is likely that any caps would be structured to aim at high-income households, and would diminish or end the mortgage tax break for many of those taxpayers.
"This is definitely a chance worth jumping for," said Amir Sufi, a professor at the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago. "For a fixed amount of revenue, it's better to remove deductions than increase marginal tax rates." 
Such a move would be fiercely opposed by the real estate industry. The industry has played a crucial role in defending the tax break, even as other countries with high homeownership have phased it out.
Housing market players who oppose any whittling down of the mortgage deduction still have plenty of time to press their case before Congress makes a decision. If President Obama and Congress do manage to reach an agreement to avoid the looming tax raises and spending cuts, their deal will be broad in nature. Then, over the following months, Congress will hash out details, like any caps on deductions.
"Until Congress introduces specific legislation, there's nothing to say about any proposed changes to the mortgage interest deduction," Gary Thomas, president of the National Association of Realtors, said in an e-mailed statement. "However, it has always been the N.A.R.'s position that the mortgage interest deduction is vital to the stability of the American housing market and economy, and we will remain vigilant in opposing any future plan that modifies or excludes the deductibility of mortgage interest."
One of the reasons the mortgage tax break is so vulnerable is that both Democrats and Republicans have recently favored capping deductions, including both President Obama and the recent Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney.
What is more, deductions could be used to grease a compromise in the budget negotiations. High earners would be hit most by deduction limits, something that might make Republicans recoil. But the party may tolerate such a policy in return for a deal that limits how much actual tax rates go up for high-income households.
Taken on its own, the deduction limit wouldn't make a huge difference. But it can play an important role in a broad plan to cut the deficit, and shows a willingness to tackle once sacred cows. The tax numbers suggest it may not be hard to structure deduction limits in a way that leaves most middle-income households untouched.
With the mortgage interest deduction, households realized tax savings of $83 billion in 2010, according to figures from the Reason Foundation. The bulk of those savings are enjoyed by the higher earners.
There are a range of ways to increase tax revenue by aiming at higher earners, some less comprehensive than others. For instance, the interest deduction relating to second homes could be ended. Also, the cap on mortgage debt eligible for the interest rate deduction - currently $1 million - could be reduced. 
There are broader approaches, too. In its proposed budget, the Obama administration plans to focus on top earners. The administration suggests capping deductions at 28 percent for high-income households, those earning more than $250,000.
Under the current rules, a high-earning household deducting $20,000 in interest payments would probably apply a 35 percent rate to that amount and receive $7,000 in tax savings. The Obama budget aims to limit that tax saving by capping that rate at 28 percent. If that rate were applied to $20,000 of interest payments, the saving would fall to $5,600.
The United States would capture the difference. Over the next 10 years, that 28 percent cap could increase tax revenue by $584 billion, according to the Treasury Department.
Separately, the Obama administration also wants to limit high earners' deductions by letting certain Bush-era exemptions expire. Altogether, the Treasury Department thinks it could raise $749 billion over 10 years by limiting deductions for higher earners. That's substantially more than the $684 billion it thinks it could raise from increasing their tax rates.
Still, there are situations where certain middle-income earners do get hit by deduction limits.
Consider a policy that uses a dollar limit, and caps all deductions at $35,000. That amount would be plenty to cover most middle-income households' mortgage interest, state and local taxes and charitable giving.
But people earning more than $100,000 may start to reach the limit, according to Sidney B. Rosenberg, associate professor emeritus at the University of North Florida. He assumes a household earns $110,000 and has a $300,000 mortgage on which it pays $17,500 a year. It also pays property taxes and state taxes at estimated nationally average rates. Such a family would have nearly $35,000 of deductible expenses, Dr. Rosenberg calculates.
One argument against curtailing the mortgage deduction is that it could reduce demand for housing, depressing home prices when the housing market is still somewhat weak. The National Association of Realtors believes a removal of the deduction could reduce property values by 15 percent, according to a presentation last year from its chief economist, Lawrence Yun.
Other analysts say they believe the housing industry overstates the potential impact. With several forms of government subsidy also supporting housing, it's hard to single out the effect of the mortgage deduction. At the most, the Reason Foundation estimates, the deduction may bolster house prices by 3 percent.
Since any deduction cap is likely to aim at higher earners, expensive houses would be most affected. But big-ticket homes appear much more resilient to shocks than lower-cost dwellings.
CoreLogic, a housing data company, tracks data that effectively divides the market into higher- and lower-cost houses, grouping them based on the size of the mortgages. The prices of the higher-cost houses are up 5.9 percent since the start of 2005, before the housing crash. In contrast, the houses at the lower end have fallen 13.5 percent in price since the beginning of 2005.
Given the apparent sturdiness of the higher end of the housing market, politicians may decide there are few risks in effectively capping mortgage deductions for high earners. Limiting tax breaks in a way that could reduce mortgage relief would be a change for Washington, which has done so much to support housing.
Nick Kasprak, an analyst at the Tax Foundation, said that up until recently he didn't expect to see a cap on deductions. "But now," he said, "it seems both parties are open to pursuing this strategy."
An earlier version of this article misstated the tax savings on $20,000 of mortgage interest payments if the tax rate on deductions were capped at 28 percent. It would be $5,600, not $5,800.

HEADLINE: The Confusing Outlooks for China's Growth

BYLINE: BILL BISHOP


HIGHLIGHT: The recent economic data out of China have been good, but there is still no consensus on predictions for 2013 growth. 

 BODY:
The recent economic data out of China have been good, but as Caixin explains there is still no consensus on predictions for 2013 growth.
Researchers at Renmin University expect 2013 "real economic growth" to be 9.3 percent. AChinese business newspaper reported on Monday that the Central Economic Work Conference would probably set the 2013 target gross domestic product growth rate at 7.5 percent in December, and the Conference Board predicted this month that the growth rate over the next six years was likely to average 5.5 percent. 
All but the most bearish analysts believe economic activity is picking up, though there are concerns that the growth is in response to real end-user demand as opposed to inventory restocking in anticipation of more stimulus. Looking past the high-frequency data, Gavyn Davies argues in The Financial Times that "China has faced greater economic challenges in the past three decades, and has succeeded in overcoming them. It can do so again." 
Do not feel bad if you are confused by the differing views about China's economy. Even the usually bearish Ambrose Evans-Pritchard seems disoriented. In a remarkable turnabout for someone who has recently written alarmist columns like "China's Economic Destiny in Doubt After Leadership Shock" and "China's Revolution Risk," Mr. Evans-Pritchard sounds almost giddy in his description of Chengdu and the potential for China as a high-tech expansion drives a second boom in the hinterland. 
 THE KEY FOR FUTURE GROWTH IS REFORM, as this column has discussed several times. Li Keqiang, No. 2 in the Communist Party and the premier-in-waiting, gave a talk last week in which he emphasized the need for continuing reforms. His comments were widely covered and praised in Chinese media but received only limited mention in most Western media, probably because of the Thanksgiving holiday in the United States. One early test of the apparent resolve for reform will be the income distribution reform plan that is expected by the end of the year, after several years of delays. Income distribution reform can happen only if the government is willing to take on special interests and state-owned enterprises. 
On Sunday, The New York Times published "Lobbying, a Windfall and a Leader's Family," the second part of its investigation into the family wealth of Premier Wen Jiabao. Ping An Insurance, the company at the center of the report, said on Monday that it was considering legal action after the reports.
Last week's column discussed the likelihood that Xi Jinping would begin a meaningful corruption crackdown. Rumors are going around that Beijing is planning an anti-corruption and rectification campaign in early 2013. The excessive role of the state in China's economy breeds graft, and without significant reform, any anti-corruption campaigns are likely to fail, even if they snare some high-level officials and impact the graft economy from which many firms profit, including global luxury goods companies. 
Both Mr. Xi and Li Keqiang have emphasized the need for rule of law in China, but there is still a yawning gap between rhetoric and reality that damages not only social order but also investor confidence and economic development. 
On Saturday Fairfax Media publisheda disturbing report about Dr. Du Zuying, a Chinese Australian cardiac surgeon who co-founded a biotech venture. The company,China Biologic Products, is now listed on Nasdaq with a market capitalization of more than $300 million. Dr Du has been in custody in Shandong Province since February 2011 and his family claims that his former partners took his shares and colluded with the local police to have him arrested. 
 A CHINESE INTERNET COMPANY successfully listed on the Nasdaq market last week. YY.com raised $82 million the day before Thanksgiving. Two existing investors bought 1.505 million of the 7.8 million shares offered and the deal priced at the bottom of the range, but it got done. And that is a positive sign for other Chinese firms considering a listing in the United States. One of the concerns about Chinese companies has been the frequent use of variable-interest entities to get around legal restrictions, as explained in a DealBook article. The Securities and Exchange Commission has raised a lot of questions about the variable interest entity structure, but its approval of the YY.com initial public offering is a sign the commission is still comfortable with it, as long as the risks are properly disclosed.
But without reforms to significantly strengthen the rule of law, the risks in China for any investor, foreign or Chinese, remain high.

HEADLINE: Bank of England's New Leader, a Member of the 'Government Sachs' Club

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: The announcement that Mark Carney will serve as the next head of the Bank of England shows that the "Government Sachs" meme isn't going anywhere. 

 BODY:
The announcement on Monday that Mark Carney will serve as the next head of the Bank of England shows that the "Government Sachs" meme isn't going anywhere. 
Mr. Carney, who is the head of the Bank of Canada, is the latest government minister to have worked at Goldman Sachs earlier in his career. (He reportedly beat out a current Goldman executive, Jim O'Neill, for the position.) 
Current members of that club include Mario Draghi, the head of the European Central Bank and a former vice chairman of the firm; Mario Monti, the Italian prime minister and a former international adviser; and Gary Gensler, the head of the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
And the list of Goldman alum in previous government posts is much more extensive, encompassing the likes of Henry M. Paulson Jr., the former Treasury secretary and onetime Goldman chief executive, and Neel T. Kashkari, a top lieutenant under Mr. Paulson who helped draft the Bush administration's response to the 2008 financial crisis. 
That's to say nothing of Robert E. Rubin, the former Treasury secretary; Stephen Friedman, the onetime chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; and Jon S. Corzine, the former senator and governor of New Jersey. 
The history of Goldman employees moving into the halls of political power is well known and highly contentious. Goldman has long been regarded as one of the savviest firms on Wall Street, and a stream of former officials taking seats in financial ministries, banking regulators and elsewhere.
Detractors of the phenomenon are legion, arguing that it leads to government policies that favor banking firms at the expense of the general populace. Proponents say that it allows for more sophisticated regulations, penned and executed by people who know Wall Street inside out.
Goldman itself has sought to play down the practice. "We're proud of our alumni, but frankly, when they work in the public sector, their presence is more of a negative than a positive for us in terms of winning business," a spokesman for the firm told The New York Times in 2008. "There is no mileage for them in giving Goldman Sachs the corporate equivalent of most-favored-nation status."
It's unclear whether Mr. Carney's time at Goldman will be a burden in his new post. He spent 13 years at Goldman, working from its London, New York and Tokyo offices, serving at one point as Goldman's head of sovereign risk for Europe, Africa and the Middle East. That position included playing a role in the firm's response to Russia's fiscal crisis and South Africa's first government bond sales after the fall of apartheid.
As the head of the Bank of Canada, Mr. Carney has largely won acclaim for steering that country's central bank through the global market turmoil of 2008, avoiding the tumult that upended England's financial institutions.
"Mark Carney is a quick study and has an enviable track record in the private sector, monetary policy and regulatory issues," Barbara Ridpath, the chief executive of the International Centre for Financial Regulation, told The Financial Times in April. "Few other 'candidates' have all three."

HEADLINE: Law Firm Bonus Time, and Cravath Goes First

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Bonuses for associates at the big law firm ranged from $10,000 for first-year associates to $60,000 for senior associates, according to a memo obtained by DealBook. Those numbers are a big bump from last year. 

 BODY:
Every year around this time, the heads of the country's largest law firms weigh the size of year-end bonuses for their junior lawyers. And almost all ask the same question: What will Cravath pay?
Cravath refers to Cravath, Swaine & Moore, one of the country's oldest and most profitable law firms.
In a quirky tradition lacking a sound explanation but one by which the industry abides, Cravath is the first to announce bonuses paid to its associates, and then other firms follow, either matching those figures - or not. 
On Monday, Cravath kicked off bonus season by announcing year-end bonuses that were substantially higher than they had been the previous two years, reflecting a strong performance for the law firm, which is based in New York. Bonuses will range from $10,000 for the most junior lawyers to $60,000 for senior associates, according to an internal Cravath memo.
Deborah Farone, a spokeswoman for Cravath, declined to comment.
Cravath's announcement surprised some competitors and legal industry experts. Four years after the global economic crisis, business remains challenging, squeezing the financial results of corporate law firms. But Cravath's pay bump will pressure competitors to increase their year-end bonuses or risk alienating their junior lawyers.
"For years, Cravath has set the bar for what it pays its associates, and other law firms follow them like lemmings to avoid any negative inference about their financial strength," said Bruce MacEwen, a law firm consultant who publishes the Web site Adam Smith, Esq. "And they need to reassure their associates that they're a top-tier firm."
Cravath has had a busy year. Large mergers-and-acquisition assignments included advising Hertz Global Holdings on its acquisition of the Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group, and Grupo Modelo in its combination with Anheuser-Busch InBev. On the litigation side, it is representing Credit Suisse and JPMorgan Chase in various lawsuits related to mortgage-backed securities, and American Express in antitrust litigation.
Starting salaries for first-year lawyers at Cravath and many other large New York firms is $160,000. Cravath ranks as the fifth most profitable firm in the country, according to The American Lawyer magazine, with profits per partner of $3.1 million.
But when spring bonuses are added to the equation, there has been little increase for Cravath's associates over the last two years. The law firm did not award spring bonuses in 2012, but last year paid its associates a small stipend in addition to a year-end reward. When 2011's spring and year-end bonuses are added together, total bonus compensation actually exceeds this year's level.
In any case, this year's numbers are still far below the year-end bonuses before the 2008 financial crisis. For 2007, for example, Cravath paid bonuses ranging from $35,000 to $110,000.
Since the crisis, business has been difficult. Corporate clients, themselves wrestling with difficult business conditions, are demanding reduced fees from their outside counsel. And while law firms have seen an uptick in lucrative merger-and-acquisition assignments from the lows of a couple of years ago, deal activity is nowhere near what it once was. A recent study by Wells Fargo's legal industry group said that demand for legal services remained weak and that, as a result, hiring had lagged.
This also was the year of the largest law firm collapse ever, when the New York law firm Dewey & LeBoeuf dissolved after filing for bankruptcy protection in May, costing hundreds of lawyers their jobs. Most Dewey lawyers, however, have landed at other firms.

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: As baby boomers reach retirement age, the country's transportation may see significant change, according to a new study. 

 BODY:
In which we bring you motoring news from around the Web:
 Baby boomers went from "fun, fun, fun till her daddy takes her T-Bird away" to become the generation that embraced the idea of the multicar family, greatly increasing the number of automobiles on the road in the United States. But as this large generation heads into the retirement years and reduces its driving, the nature of the country's transportation system may see more significant change, according to a study by the AARP Public Policy Institute. 
 The baby boomer generation "has been the major driver of overall growth in travel in the United States, and that has had a tremendous impact over the past 40 years on how we have approached transportation planning," said Jana Lynott, an author of the report. But as boomers stop commuting to work and perhaps stop driving altogether, the roadways may become less congested and more public transit may be needed. (Associated Press)
 For many drivers of the Toyota Prius, fuel economy is a big draw. But now comes word of another advantage for Prius owners. The National Insurance Crime Bureau reports that the Prius has a much lower theft rate than other cars and a much higher recovery rate. USA Today suggests that perhaps the Prius is just not cool enough for car thieves. Of course, Priuses still are stolen, and the states where that is most likely to happen are California, Florida, New York, Washington and Texas. (USA Today)
 For those who have their cars wrapped in advertising messages, a little caution is necessary when driving through McAllen, Tex. The city's sign ordinance, which prohibits off-premise and portable signs, bans parking for the purpose of advertising. But as the McAllen Monitor reports, the ordinance has confused some drivers -- including one of the town's own police officers, whose Scion iQ was ticketed for violating the code.

HEADLINE: Universities Ponder Accounting 101: How to Balance the Books

BYLINE: JOYCE LAU


HIGHLIGHT: Should universities be government-funded basic services, like roads and hospitals? Or should they be market driven? If so, will only big-name, elite schools draw moneyed donors and rich students? 

 BODY:
It's considered an impolite topic in some scholarly circles, where academics would rather talk about resources or funding than say the "m" word. But the reality is that academia needs money to survive. Whatever a school's goals are-giving a chance to poor students, encouraging better teaching, driving great research-someone has to pay.
And on the money front, things aren't looking great in Europe. Cynics might say that last week was typical: European Union budget talks fell apart, and more students protested in London over rising tuition fees. 
Christopher F. Schuetze reports on how the financial crisis has hit universities in various European nations -- which, despite grand-sounding schemes like the Bologna Process, vary greatly in the way they fund and manage their education systems.
It's no surprise that hard-hit economies like Ireland, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain had significant education cuts. Ireland, in particular, is facing a challenge: A '90s baby boom means there will be more kids heading to university than ever before, and less money to pay for them.
And the situation sounds dire in Italy. "We are running the risk of the collapse of the system," Marco Mancini, president of the Conference of Italian University Rectors, said about education cuts.
But the cuts are not universal. Surprisingly, nine E.U. nations -- including, notably France, Germany and Switzerland -- have increased higher education funding these past few years.
Funding may be uneven, but tuition rates for European students are not, which has led to in-fighting over who pays when young people cross borders. As Nina Siegal reports, some Belgians have bristled over Dutch students enrolling in their schools, where annual tuition is a scant (EURO)578 -- but costs local taxpayers about (EURO)10,000 per year per student.
Part of the problem -- if you can call it that -- is that most Continental Europeans consider affordable higher education a universal right, to be largely funded by the state and shared by all. Their relatively low domestic tuition fees are the envy of foreign students, who are paying many times those rates.
The notable exception is Britain, which raised its tuition cap for local students to 9,000 a year, making it the third-priciest university system in the world, after the United States and South Korea.
That drastic rise may have a chilling effect on the Continent. "If this is what can be done in the U.K., a democracy with one of the top education systems in the world, what will stop governments from doing it elsewhere?" Howard Hotson of the Council for the Defense of British Universities said in a phone conversation.
But, as any accounting student will tell you, you have to balance the books. If public coffers are running low, universities have to find other ways to make up the cash. Raising tuition is one way. Canvassing philanthropists and former graduates is another. D.D. Guttenplan writes about the University College London's rather macabre new appeal for alumni donations. 
Yet another is to admit more wealthy foreign students, whose tuition is not funded by the state. But if a school admits too many, it may change the broader feel of a campus, dilute quality and anger local taxpayers who feel that their children's places are being given away.
 I once asked a president of an elite U.S. university whether it used foreign students this way. He said that his own institution's admissions were "needs blind," meaning they were based only on the quality of the candidates and not on nationality or economic status. That, ideally, is how it should be done everywhere.
But then he leaned over and -- off the record, of course -- said, "I'm not more moral than anyone else; I just have more money. If the school didn't have its huge endowment, I might be standing on the sidewalk waving in foreign students, too."
 Do you think universities should be government-funded basic services, like roads and hospitals? Or should they be market driven? If so, will only big-name, elite schools draw moneyed donors and rich students?

HEADLINE: The Times Should Explain Marginal Tax Rates - Repeatedly, if Necessary

BYLINE: MARGARET SULLIVAN


HIGHLIGHT: Readers complain that articles allow false statements to go unchallenged. 

 BODY:
Now that Thanksgiving is over, isn't it time to turn our attention from turkey, parades and football to, well, marginal tax rates?
A number of Times readers think it's high time. 
They were disturbed last week when a Business Day story quoted - and didn't challenge the thinking of -- small-business owners who didn't seem to understand how marginal tax rates work. Under a headline that read, "Investors Rush to Beat Threat of Higher Taxes," the article quoted a chiropractor in McLean, Va., saying that she and her husband planned to monitor the business income from their joint practice to avoid crossing a threshold for higher taxes. She appeared to believe that if the income went over "the cutoff line," that all of their income would be taxed at a higher rate. That's not the case. Only the amount over the limit is taxed at the higher rate.
The Times, these readers say, shouldn't let inaccurate thinking go unchallenged -- any time it appears.
Len Charlap, a reader from Princeton, N.J., put it this way: "You know what marginal rates are. It is your obligation to explain this your readers, many of whom do not or forget to apply that knowledge."
And The Times took a hit from Jason Linkins in The Huffington Post. He called it "the sort of innumeracy that spreads casually, in minor articles such as this piece in The Times, where this aggravating ignorance somehow manages to find its way into the copy." The misunderstanding, he claimed, "could spread like a supervirus." 
"There are not 'two sides' to this issue," Mr. Linkins summed up. "You either understand how marginal tax rates work or you do not, and reporters are absolutely allowed to point out who is right and who is wrong."
Lawrence Ingrassia, the business editor of The Times, called this complaint "a fair point." He said that The Times should do a better job of making clear how marginal tax rates work. "We'll keep that in mind going forward."
There is a need to be precise, he said. But the broader point of the article, and others like it, "that some people may change their economic behavior based on tax policies is a reasonable one to write about, even if some people think that it won't because it adheres to their political leanings."
He noted that an article the following day explained marginal tax rates and their consequences.
I've written in the past about fact-checking, and the growing desire by readers to have The Times, and other news organizations, clearly state established truths, even when there is a countervailing opinion. That principle applies to this subject, too.
When someone gets it wrong, The Times has an obligation to set the record straight, right then and there.

HEADLINE: The Unhappy Marriage of Capitalism and Conservatism

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: Uneasy at their deteriorating economic status, social conservatives may need to look beyond capitalism to shape a more comfortable society, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Nancy Folbre is an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. She recently edited and contributed to "For Love and Money: Care Provision in the United States." 
One explanation of Mitt Romney's defeat in the presidential race focuses on the growing demographic diversity of the electorate. The declining share of white men in the voting population clearly had an impact. But another underlying factor - one that reflects economic rather than demographic dynamics - also deserves consideration.
The economic interests of capitalists (defined as those who earn most of their income from capital) are beginning to diverge significantly from the interests of social conservatives (defined as those who prefer traditional gender relations and oppose government efforts to promote racial and ethnic equality). 
In other words, the symbolic marriage of capitalism and conservatism is showing signs of strain.
It was never an idyllic relationship. The early growth of capitalism weakened the pre-existing patriarchal feudal system. In the late 18th century, Edmund Burke, the Irish writer and member of Parliament considered one of the founders of modern conservatism, famously warned that the single-minded pursuit of economic self-interest would undermine hallowed traditions.
Yet in many ways capitalism was shaped by those traditions, as it interacted with inequalities based on gender, race, ethnicity and citizenship. For much of its history in the United States, capitalism benefited a relatively wide swath of farmers, small business people and union members - white male heads of household with considerable power over how their money would be spent in their families and how their tax dollars would be distributed in their communities.

After a rocky period during the Great Depression and an economic recovery linked to both New Deal policies and military mobilization, the United States economy enjoyed steady gains in family income. The period between 1950 and the mid-1970s is sometimes termed the Golden Age.
Many women and people of color gained new opportunities as they gradually moved into higher echelons of wage employment. Until the 21st century, however, they did not represent a significant threat to the economic or cultural hegemony of white men.
One of the most beneficial consequences of a pattern of capitalist development shaped by political democracy was a growing demand for human capital that helped members of previously disempowered groups compete effectively for economic success and political leadership.
President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton are important icons of this economic shift. Their success, symbolizing that of many who share their demographic characteristics, has fostered resentment partly because it has come during a period of declining median family income.
But neither resentment nor recession hurt the Democratic Party as much as they might have, for three reasons. First, growing publicity about income inequality has called attention to a growing class divide that has left many social conservatives bewildered by their deteriorating position. Mr. Romney, as well as many of his most visible political donors, looked down on most of the white electorate from mountains of personal wealth.
Second, the polarization of income itself reflects the evolution of a partly denationalized form of capitalism in which our largest companies create more jobs in other countries than at home and minimize their tax payments in overseas tax shelters.
During the race for the Republican nomination, Newt Gingrich condemned Bain Capital, the firm that Mitt Romney helped build, as a form of "vulture capitalism."
He explicitly contrasted capitalist and conservative ideals:
There's a big difference between people who go out and create a company - even if they fail - if they try to go in the right direction, if they share in the hardships, if they're out there with the workers doing it together. That's one thing. But if someone who is very wealthy comes in and takes over your company and takes out all the cash and leaves behind the unemployment? I think that's not a model we want to advocate, and I don't think any conservative wants to get caught defending that kind of model.
Third, the role that the powerful banking sector played in the recession highlighted growing divisions within the business community. As Mr. Gingrich also explained:
Main Street has always been suspicious of Wall Street. Small businesses have always worried about big businesses. I'm very uncomfortable when I see seven or eight banks take 80 percent of the market share and crowd out small independent banks, and I think people have a natural concern when they see financiers come in from out of town, take over a company, take all the profit and then leave people unemployed behind.
Litigation over swipe fees for debit and credit cards also reflects Main Street versus Wall Street. Within the retail sector, the growth of megaretailers like Wal-Mart and Amazon has hurt prospects for many small businesses.
Conservatives are, almost by definition, resistant to change. Most still cling to their romance with an earlier, more attractive form of capitalism - that handsome, dependable breadwinner whose occasional infidelities were largely concealed from view.
But the concerns they express about the weakening of family ties apply quite clearly to concerns about the weakening of community ties. Consider what David Brooks of The New York Times recently wrote about the problem of "too many possibilities":
People are not better off when they are given maximum personal freedom to do what they want. They're better off when they are enshrouded in commitments that transcend personal choice - commitments to family, God, craft and country.
Couldn't the same be said of major corporations?
Capitalists and conservatives should ask who's committed to whom, and for how long. Not all marriages are made in heaven.

HEADLINE: Former SAC Trader to Appear in Court

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: The latest alumnus of SAC Capital Advisors is set to appear in federal court in Manhattan on Monday. | How the family of China's prime minister grew wealthy from an investment in Ping An Insurance. | A trading loss at UBS has led to a fine of &#163;29.7 million. | Qatar Holding has said its remaining warrants in Barclays. 

 BODY:
Mathew Martoma, the latest alumnus of SAC Capital Advisors to be accused of breaking the law, is set to appear in Federal District Court in Manhattan on Monday morning. The insider trading case against him "represents a watershed moment" in the government's investigation of SAC Capital, as it links the hedge fund's founder, Steven A. Cohen, to trading activity the government says was illegal, DealBook's Peter Lattman reports.
 The case against Mr. Martoma, according to former employees of the hedge fund, "highlighted SAC's high-stress, pressure-packed culture," where employees tried to gather as much information as possible about publicly traded companies. Mr. Martoma, "brainy and unassuming," with a Stanford business degree, was hired for a new research unit that would help the hedge fund gain an edge.
Mr. Lattman writes: "Mr. Martoma is charged with corrupting a doctor who had access to secret drug data, then using that information to gain profits and avert losses totaling $276 million. Mr. Martoma closely collaborated with Mr. Cohen on the questionable trades, prosecutors contend." 
IN CHINA, LOBBYING EFFORT LED TO A WINDFALL | The family of China's prime minister, Wen Jiabao, grew wealthy during his leadership, but the greatest source of wealth came after Ping An Insurance, a financial services giant, mounted a successful lobbying effort, David Barboza reports in The New York Times. Back in 1999, when the insurer was struggling, its chairman made direct appeals to Mr. Wen that it be exempted from a rule that would require it to break up. After the insurer was granted a waiver, relatives of Mr. Wen made an investment in Ping An through another company, Mr. Barboza reports. "By June 2004, the shares held by the Wen relatives had already quadrupled in value, even before the company was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange." By 2007, the initial $65 million investment had grown to $3.7 billion. 
UBS FINED $47.5 MILLION | UBS's $2.3 billion trading loss has led to a fine of 29.7 million on the bank. The penalty was among the largest ever issued by Britain's Financial Services Authority, DealBook's Mark Scott reports. The regulator found that UBS failed to prevent the loss by a former trader, Kweku M. Adoboli, who received a seven-year jail sentence last week.
QATAR FUND SELLS BARCLAYS WARRANTS | DealBook's Mark Scott reports: "The sovereign wealth fund Qatar Holding said on Monday that it had sold its remaining warrants in Barclays in a deal that has led to a $1.2 billion share sale in the British bank. Qatar Holding had acquired the warrants, which are financial instruments that can be exchanged for stock, during the financial crisis. Barclays raised 7 billion ($10.5 billion) in 2008 from new investors."
 Some big investors of Barclays are pushing for a major restructuring, according to The Financial Times. In recent meetings, "at least three of the 30 biggest shareholders" have told executives including Antony P. Jenkins, the chief, that Barclays should consider following the lead of UBS, which announced plans to scale back its fixed-income business. Popular proposals include closing the equities business or spinning off the investment bank, according to the newspaper, which quotes one unidentified bank insider as saying that the "20 percent pop in the UBS share price has got investors' juices flowing."
BAXTER INTERNATIONAL LOOKS TO BUY GAMBRO | Baxter International is in talks to buy Gambro of Sweden for about $4 billion, with a possible deal at least two weeks away, people briefed on the matter told DealBook on Friday. "A deal for Gambro would help bolster Baxter's lineup of dialysis products. The Swedish company focuses on equipment that is used in hospitals and other medical facilities." And a takeover would be the biggest deal ever for Baxter, which is based in Deerfield, Ill.
ON THE AGENDA | In Europe, finance ministers are meeting to discuss releasing the latest package of aid to Greece. The Dallas Fed releases its survey of manufacturers for November at 10:30 a.m. Peter Fisher, BlackRock's global head of fixed income, is on CNBC at 7 p.m.
BUFFETT'S PLEA FOR HIGHER TAXES | Writing in an Op-Ed essay in The New York Times, Warren E. Buffett challenges the idea that higher tax rates discourage investment. In the days when tax rates were higher, he says, "never did anyone mention taxes as a reason to forgo an investment opportunity that I offered." He continues: "So let's forget about the rich and ultrarich going on strike and stuffing their ample funds under their mattresses if - gasp - capital gains rates and ordinary income rates are increased. The ultrarich, including me, will forever pursue investment opportunities."
Mr. Buffett offers policy proposals: "I support President Obama's proposal to eliminate the Bush tax cuts for high-income taxpayers. However, I prefer a cutoff point somewhat above $250,000 - maybe $500,000 or so. Additionally, we need Congress, right now, to enact a minimum tax on high incomes. I would suggest 30 percent of taxable income between $1 million and $10 million, and 35 percent on amounts above that."

HEADLINE: The Lord of the Taxes

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: Listening to Grover Norquist talk about his no-new-taxes pledge can be like listening to a die-hard "Lord of the Rings" fan explain the back story to how the age of elves is ending and the age of men is beginning. 

 BODY:
Listening to the conservative activist Grover Norquist talk about the no-new-taxes pledge that he has made his life's work can be like listening to a die-hard "Lord of the Rings" fan explain the back story to how the age of elves is ending and the age of men is beginning. It's all about arcane rites and rules that are impossible to follow, and it's treated like religion. 
Appearing on CNN today, Mr. Norquist was asked about the growing number of Republicans who are saying that maybe Congress will, in fact, have to raise taxes in order to avoid a fiscal cliff now and cut the budget deficit later.
Mr. Norquist followed the old Washington maxim: he admitted nothing, denied everything and made counter charges.
He said there was no real Republican fallout against the tax pledge, just "some people discussing impure thoughts on national television." His interviewer laughed, but Mr. Norquist didn't. And the rest of his comments made it pretty clear that he views the no-taxes pledge as a thing of awesome majesty, an act of pure faith, something that cannot be laughed at -- even though it no longer enjoys the support it once had in Congress.
Mr. Norquist rejected New York Representative Peter King's argument that the tax pledge, which Republicans are coerced into signing when they run for Congress, is only valid for that term and does not apply to an entire career. "Peter King knows full well that the pledge he signed is for while you're in Congress," Mr. Norquist said.
He declared piously that, after all, the pledge is not to him (which, of course, it is) but rather to voters (which, of course, it is not) even though his group, Americans for Tax Reform, spent $16 million in this last election cycle to promote its no-taxes position in Congressional races.
Mr. Norquist further noted that Ohio Representative Steven LaTourette's argument, upon his retirement, that the pledge was a one-term commitment didn't "pass the laugh test."
But Mr. Norquist's entire tax crusade fails to pass the laugh test as serious - or even unserious -- economic policy. It has mired the United States in economic turmoil. And yet it endures, because Republicans are afraid they will be made to pay for their transgressions in the next election.

It was then, after all, that lovers of local basketball got their first full glimpse of the long-awaited rivalry, an internecine hoops game that should, at least in theory, generate a grudge match as enduring and divisive as the pre-existing feud between the Yankees and the Mets. Here, New York Knicks fans crossed into enemy terrain on N and Q trains arriving about 6 p.m. from Manhattan, their blue-and-orange regalia standing out in the surrounding sea of black. Confronting them from Nos. 2 and 3 trains streaming out of Prospect Heights and Brownsville were their counterparts from across Kings County -- an equally impassioned, if recently converted, crowd that came in force to support the Brooklyn Nets --who won, 96-89.
While the geography of loyalty was sometimes imprecise, this was basketball in the newly divided city, which is to say it was basketball as local tribal warfare. Jay-Z, a partner in the Nets, wore a Brooklyn sweatshirt and baseball cap; Charlie Rose sat near him in a V-neck sweater that betrayed no affiliation. 
At a Modell's Sporting Goods store across from the arena, there were vast quantities of Nets shirts, Nets caps and plastic Nets flip-flops -- but only a few scant racks of Knicks gear. Up the street, meanwhile, at a restaurant called Woodland, the evening barman was serving up a special Nets cocktail of Stolichnaya vodka, honey and a splash of ginger ale.
''We're calling it the Rivalry,'' he said.
Scheduled for Nov. 1, but delayed by Hurricane Sandy, the Game -- which deserved its capital letter -- had finally arrived. It may have lacked the panache of an authentic opening night, but it did include an enhancement that nobody expected: two competing teams from the same competitive city, both of which were off to winning starts.
''To us, the Nets have always been like a stepsister,'' said Gregory Armstrong, 48 and a Knicks supporter. While Mr. Armstrong, a supermarket manager, gave the Nets ''some credit'' for moving to the city, it did not affect his loyalties. ''Nothing's changed -- wherever the Knicks play in New York, it's still a home game,'' he said.
There was, despite athletic disagreements, a pleasant hometown spirit at the game. Part of this was no doubt economic: As of Monday afternoon, courtside seats could be bought online for $1,500, and even the nosebleed seats in the highest upper decks were selling for more than $300.
Part, however, was that unique New York aggressiveness, a friendly form of fratricide that manages to be affable and belligerent at once. Case in point was the barbed exchange between Spike Lee, the filmmaker and Knicks fan, and Marty Markowitz, the Brooklyn borough president.
It began last month with an interview in which Mr. Markowitz forgave Mr. Lee, who was born in Brooklyn, for persisting in his backing of the Knicks. On Monday afternoon, Mr. Lee wrote a post on Twitter: ''Dear Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz, With All Due Respect I've Been A NEW YORK KNICERBOCKERS Devotee Since 1967, Not Gonna Switch.''
Two hours later, Mr. Markowitz wrote back, ''@SpikeLee I believe so much in #Nets that I think we should make friendly bet...loser changes his twitter avatar to winner's logo You game?''
Underlying these sociable assaults was a deeper-seated skirmish that went beyond the boundaries of sports. Knicks vs. Nets was, of course, no more than the latest manifestation of Manhattan vs. Brooklyn, an interborough battle that has included in its various iterations Lombardi's vs. Grimaldi's, high-rises vs. brownstones, the Giants vs. the Dodgers and the yuppies of the Upper West Side vs. the yuppies in Park Slope.
Complicating matters, this year in particular, is that the Knicks began the season with the general derision of their fans. Many have complained that the team is too slow, is too old and was exceptionally foolish to have signed the point guard Jason Kidd while firing his colleague, the younger Jeremy Lin. The Nets, of course, have been all too happy to exploit this discontent and to make their bid as the city's favorite team, an attempt at underdog ascendancy that was visible Monday night.
For instance, there was Anthony Incarnato, a Brooklyn-born Nets fan, who came to the game in a kind of reverse commute from his home in southern New Jersey. ''I fell in love with the team in 1997,'' said Mr. Incarnato, 24 and a student of hotel management. ''I've always had a stake in them -- I guess for good or bad.''
There were some who argued that there is no such thing as a Nets fan; there are only fans of Brooklyn who, lacking better options, are forced to support the Nets. One of these was Ricardo Varona, 52, who was waving a Knicks pennant and spinning a basketball atop his finger -- all while circling the Barclays Center's plaza in a pair of in-line skates.
''To me, it's just another New York battle,'' Mr. Varona said. ''The Nets being right here in the city? It makes the Knicks play harder.''

HEADLINE: Enclaves, Long Gated, Seek to Let In Storm Aid

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER; Matthew Wolfe contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Sea Gate looks the same as many storm-scattered waterfront communities do. Home after home torn apart by the ocean. Streets filled with sand. Shattered sidewalks and clogged sewers. A sea wall, which had already been inadequate to the task of safeguarding residents, reduced to rubble.
Ordinarily, New York City or other governmental entities might take over the tasks of restoring a middle-class neighborhood like this. But Sea Gate, with its 850 homes on Coney Island's western tip, is not an ordinary neighborhood. It is a 113-year-old private, gated community, where the razor-wire-topped fences and armed security checkpoints that keep outsiders from its streets, beaches and parks serve as a constant reminder that the residents of this community have chosen to live somewhat apart.
Once the gilded retreat of the Vanderbilt family, Sea Gate, like other gated communities in New York, preserved its exclusivity with the promise that the residents would assume the costs of community upkeep, maintaining their own streets, parks and sewer systems and even fielding the distinct Sea Gate Police Department.
The special status endured, through occasional controversy and political efforts to open the streets to the public, because of the community's self-sufficiency. 
But the damage inflicted by Hurricane Sandy to Sea Gate, in Brooklyn, and another gated community, Breezy Point, in Queens, was so monumental that residents who are already struggling to figure out how they will pay to rebuild their homes say they cannot afford to pay the additional cost of repairing communal infrastructure. So neighborhoods that have long held the rest of the city at arm's length now seek the financial embrace of the city, state and federal governments.
That turnaround has been ill-received among some on the other side of the fence from Sea Gate, in historically troubled apartment towers like Sea Rise, where Cesar Catala, 29, picked up some hot food from a relief tent on Monday.
''They seclude themselves,'' said Mr. Catala, who has lived in Coney Island nearly his entire life. ''We don't have problems with Sea Gate, but they put their noses down at us. We get treated like we're second class, just because they live in houses and we live in the projects and we rent. They say they need assistance and, fine, maybe they do need assistance. But they have insurance on their houses. We don't have insurance. We don't have much out here.''
In Breezy Point, a gated community on the western edge of the Rockaways, 111 homes burned to the ground during the storm.
''We'd be foolish not to ask for help,'' said Steve Greenberg, former chairman of the Breezy Point cooperative's board and a financial adviser at Morgan Stanley. ''We would hope that we see something, but if we don't see something we're prepared to go forward to keep the community.''
Leaving aside the policy question of whether flood-prone communities should be rebuilt at all, these insular areas pose unusual challenges for public agencies.
Community officials have long maintained that their enclaves are no different than a Park Avenue apartment house with its own doorman, a horizontal rather than a vertical development. But, to continue the analogy, apartment buildings do not ask the city to retile their hallways or fix their plumbing. The residents of gated communities pay all the same taxes -- sewer, water and property -- that any city property owner does, in addition to their private association charges.
But the city does not appear to have a formal obligation to provide services, like road and sewer maintenance, for the infrastructure that gated communities agreed to maintain.
''Now, with this unexpected act of God, those same communities, quite ready to point a finger at government shortcomings, are placed in the difficult position of having to reach out to government for a substantial helping hand,'' said Paula A. Franzese, a law professor at Seton Hall University who has written extensively about gated communities.
Already city officials have dispatched private contractors with bulldozers to cart away the sand and concrete slabs from Sea Gate's streets and trucks to vacuum the sand out of its sewers. The city's Department of Environmental Protection has supplied drinking water to Breezy Point residents. Yet it is apparent that government officials are improvising for now, not sure what the fine legal boundaries are and whether their efforts will extend to rebuilding the infrastructure.
Caswell F. Holloway, deputy mayor for operations, said City Hall wanted all residents, including those living in private communities that were hardest hit by the storm, to have the systems restored that allowed them ''to get back to normal as quickly and efficiently as possible.''
''We're not going to let the form of the community, whether private or gated, stand in the way of getting the outcome we all want, which is to help them recover,'' he said. ''It's in everyone's interest to get these communities back. If they're successful, the city is successful.''
William Korn, 52, the owner of a bakery who says his house in Sea Gate sustained over $300,000 in damage, said the city should pay for rebuilding the community even if it is gated because residents pay city taxes. ''I don't pay for water?'' he said rhetorically, as if the question were absurd. ''I don't pay for real estate taxes -- $6,000 a year? I don't pay for services? I pay all those. Just because we have a private community? I pay for that private community.''
Charles Brecher, research director at the nonpartisan Citizens Budget Commission, said that obligation should be factored in to any decision. ''We should help people in disasters but we should hold people responsible for what they've agreed to be responsible for,'' he said.
The city planning department said it did not know how many private communities that control their own streets were in the city's borders. There are at least eight, though not all are gated, including Forest Hills Gardens in Queens, Edgewater Park in the Bronx and the Tides at Charleston and Bay Street Landing in Staten Island.
More suburban New Jersey has about 6,000 private communities, said Professor Franzese.
Each gated community has discrete historical origins. In the late 19th century Sea Gate boasted plutocratic property owners like the Vanderbilt and Morgan families, but a real estate company bought the land and then sold it to a homeowners association in 1899. Breezy Point was an informal bungalow colony in the early 20th century, but a real estate corporation bought the underlying land in 1960 and residents -- many of them police officers, firefighters and city workers -- purchased half of that property as a cooperative that today has over 3,000 homes. One of the more recent private communities is the Tides, a six-year-old, 190-house complex for people older than 55.
Developers apply to get the names of any city streets within a purchased plot removed from official city maps, which requires a vote by the City Council.
If demapping is approved, the street essentially becomes private property and the community can choose to bar nonresidents, though the city can apply leverage during the negotiations over land use to keep the street open to the public -- as the streets of Fieldston, a private but not gated community, are in the Bronx.
The city may provide limited services, also negotiated, like fire services in Sea Gate and police services in Breezy Point. There is in some cases resentment between the enclaves and neighborhoods that surround them, which are often demographically very different. Though these places do not have restrictive covenants -- Sea Gate, by some accounts, once restricted Jews but now has a large Jewish population -- a majority of residents are white and are surrounded by areas with large poor black and Hispanic populations. The median household income in Breezy Point was $83,000 in 2010, while Sea Gate's was $62,000.
Even before the storm, the communities were increasingly turning to the city for assistance. Domenic M. Recchia Jr., chairman of the City Council's Finance Committee, whose district includes Sea Gate, had been working to get the city to upgrade the enclave's sewers because they cannot handle the runoff from large storms.
''Just because they're a gated community, they're still citizens and pay taxes,'' he said. ''They won't be able to sustain themselves. Anybody can say what they want, but we can't turn our back on them.''
Pinny Dembitzer, president of the Sea Gate Association, said that since the national economic downturn, many residents were unable to pay maintenance charges averaging $3,000, which could jeopardize the solvency of the association. Now, he said, they found themselves in ''a Catch-22 situation.''
''If they get enough money to build their homes, they can't have enough money to rebuild the sea wall,'' he said. ''But if they don't rebuild the sea wall they can't rebuild their homes.''
Even as the communities put together formal requests for assistance, residents like Yidel Lax, 62, an artist whose house was flooded, are unwilling to part with the community's most prized feature. ''The only reason that Sea Gate is what it is is because it's private,'' he said. ''Otherwise, it wouldn't be Sea Gate.''

HEADLINE: In an Answer to China In the Pacific, Japan Flexes Military Muscle

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

 BODY:
TOKYO -- After years of watching its international influence eroded by a slow-motion economic decline, the pacifist nation of Japan is trying to raise its profile in a new way, offering military aid for the first time in decades and displaying its own armed forces in an effort to build regional alliances and shore up other countries' defenses to counter a rising China.
Already this year, Japan crossed a little-noted threshold by providing its first military aid abroad since the end of World War II, approving a $2 million package for its military engineers to train troops in Cambodia and East Timor in disaster relief and skills like road building. Japanese warships have not only conducted joint exercises with a growing number of military forces in the Pacific and Asia, but they have also begun making regular port visits to countries long fearful of a resurgence of Japan's military.
And after stepping up civilian aid programs to train and equip the coast guards of other nations, Japanese defense officials and analysts say, Japan could soon reach another milestone: beginning sales in the region of military hardware like seaplanes, and perhaps eventually the stealthy diesel-powered submarines considered well suited to the shallow waters where China is making increasingly assertive territorial claims. 
Taken together those steps, while modest, represent a significant shift for Japan, which had resisted repeated calls from the United States to become a true regional power for fear that doing so would move it too far from its postwar pacifism. The country's quiet resolve to edge past that reluctance and become more of a player comes as the United States and China are staking their own claims to power in Asia, and as jitters over China's ambitions appear to be softening bitterness toward Japan among some Southeast Asian countries trampled last century in its quest for colonial domination.
The driver for Japan's shifting national security strategy is its tense dispute with China over uninhabited islands in the East China Sea that is feeding Japanese anxiety that the country's relative decline -- and the financial struggles of its traditional protector, the United States -- are leaving Japan increasingly vulnerable.
''During the cold war, all Japan had to do was follow the U.S.,'' said Keiro Kitagami, a special adviser on security issues to Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda. ''With China, it's different. Japan has to take a stand on its own.''
Japan's moves do not mean it might transform its military, which serves a purely defensive role, into an offensive force anytime soon. The public has resisted past efforts by some politicians to revamp Japan's pacifist constitution, and the nation's vast debt will limit how much military aid it can extend.
But it is also clear that attitudes in Japan are evolving as China continues its double-digit annual growth in military spending and asserts that it should be in charge of the islands that Japan claims, as well as vast swaths of the South China Sea that various Southeast Asian nations say are in their control.
Japanese leaders have met the Chinese challenge over the islands known as the Senkaku in Japan and the Diaoyu in China with an uncharacteristic willingness to push back, and polls show the public increasingly agrees. Both major political parties are also talking openly about instituting a more flexible reading of the constitution that would allow Japan to come to the defense of allies -- shooting down any North Korean missile headed for the United States, for instance -- blurring the line between an offensive and defensive force.
The country's self-defense forces had already begun nosing over that line in Iraq and Afghanistan, where Japan backed the United States-led campaigns by deploying naval tankers to refuel warships in the Indian Ocean.
Japanese officials say their strategy is not to begin a race for influence with China, but to build up ties with other nations that share worries about their imposing neighbor. They acknowledge that even building the capacity of other nations' coast guards is a way of strengthening those countries' ability to stand up to any Chinese threat.
''We want to build our own coalition of the willing in Asia to prevent China from just running over us,'' said Yoshihide Soeya, director of the Institute of East Asian Studies at Keio University in Tokyo.
Or, as the vice minister of defense, Akihisa Nagashima, said in an interview, ''We cannot just allow Japan to go into quiet decline.''
The United States has generally welcomed such efforts by Japan, which are in line with its own strategy of building up Asian nations militarily so they can stand their ground against China, as well as expanding an American military presence in the region.
China, which itself suffered mightily in imperial Japan's 20th-century territorial grabs, has reacted with warnings that Japan is trying to overturn the outcome of World War II by staging a military comeback. At a defense conference in Australia last month, Lt. Gen. Ren Haiquan of China warned his hosts against allying more closely with what he called a fascist nation that once bombed the Australian city of Darwin.
In a measure of the geopolitical changes roiling the region, however, concerns about any resurgent Japanese militarism appear to be fading in some countries embroiled in their own territorial disputes with China, like Vietnam and the Philippines, the scene of fierce fighting during the war.
Analysts there and elsewhere in the region said their countries welcomed, and sometimes invited, Japan's help.
''We have already put aside our nightmares of World War II because of the threat posed by China,'' said Rommel Banlaoi, a security expert at the Philippine Institute for Peace, Violence and Terrorism Research in Manila.
On a recent morning, 22 coast guard officials from a dozen Asian and African nations joined a training cruise around Tokyo Bay aboard a sleek, white Japanese Coast Guard cutter. The visitors snapped photos of the engine room, the electronics-studded bridge and the 20-millimeter cannon. Before the cutter left port, the foreign contingent and the Japanese crew stood at attention on deck facing each other, then bowed deeply.
''Japan is joining the United States and Australia in helping us face China,'' said Mark Lim, an administrative officer from the Philippine Coast Guard who joined the cruise.
Japan is widely viewed as being the only nation in the region with a navy powerful enough to check China.
Although Japan's military spending has been shrinking, the military budget is, by many measures, the sixth largest in the world. In keeping with its pacifist stance, Japan has none of the long-range missiles, nuclear submarines or large aircraft carriers necessary for projecting real power. But its diesel-powered subs are considered the best of their type in the world. The Japanese Navy also has sophisticated Aegis-equipped cruisers capable of shooting down ballistic missiles, and two large helicopter-carrying destroyers that could be retrofitted to carry fighter jets that can take off vertically.
The Japanese Navy took a big step toward opening up in 2009 by holding a joint military drill with Australia -- its first such exercise with a nation besides the United States. It has since joined a number of multinational naval drills in Southeast Asia, and in June held its first joint maneuver with India.
Analysts and former officials say Japan's military has so far been careful to offer assistance in noncombat-related areas like disaster relief, antipiracy and health care. But even these limited steps build ties between military forces. One plan now under negotiation is to train medical personnel from Vietnam's navy next year to care for the crews on that nation's newly purchased Russian-built submarines.
''Our strategy is to offer hardware and training to create mini-Japanese coast guards and mini-Japanese Self-Defense Forces around the South China Sea,'' said Tetsuo Kotani, a researcher at the Japan Institute of International Affairs in Tokyo.
Under the decade-old civilian aid program to build up regional coast guards, Japanese officials say they are in the final stages of what would be their biggest security-related aid package yet -- to provide the Philippine Coast Guard with 10 cutters worth about $12 million each. Ministry officials say they may offer similar ships to Vietnam.
Japan's Ministry of Defense said it planned to double its military aid program next year to help Indonesia and Vietnam. Vietnam could also be among the countries that Japan would allow to buy its submarines, according to a former defense minister, Toshimi Kitazawa, who named Australia and Malaysia as other possible buyers.
''Japan has been insensitive to the security needs of its regional neighbors,'' Mr. Kitazawa said in a recent interview. ''We can offer much to increase their peace of mind.''

HEADLINE: Scottexalonia Rising

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

 BODY:
London
BANNERS at FC Barcelona's Camp Nou soccer stadium have long declared: ''Catalonia is not Spain.''
That notion got a boost this weekend as pro-independence parties won Catalonian elections and strengthened the region's drive for a referendum on secession in defiance of the Spanish Constitution and of Mariano Rajoy, the embattled center-right prime minister.
Indeed, such is Spain's economic crisis that Rajoy declared in June that ''Spain is not Uganda,'' prompting the Ugandan foreign minister to retort the next day that, ''Uganda does not want to be Spain!'' 
So a majority of Catalonia's 7.5 million citizens, it seems, no longer want to be in Spain -- and a majority of Ugandans would rather be in Uganda. The crisis of the euro zone has accentuated longstanding Catalonian resentment over tax transfers to Madrid and sharpened the nationalism of the region with the biggest economy in Spain -- larger than Greece's, as Catalans like to point out.
(Elena Salgado, the former Spanish finance minister, noted in 2010 that, ''Spain is not Greece.'' Later that year, clearly irked, the then Greek finance minister declared that, ''Greece is not Ireland.'' The former Irish finance minister, Brian Lenihan, retorted that ''Ireland is not in Greek territory.'' Meanwhile, the secretary general of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development weighed in: ''Neither Spain nor Portugal is Ireland.'')
The euro crisis is also a crisis of euro-geography. Scotland has scheduled for 2014 a referendum on independence, 307 years after the political union that created the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom mutters about withdrawal from the European Union.
So much for globalization, the disappearance of frontiers in Europe, borderless cyberworlds, hyperconnectivity and all the forces that seem to make a mockery of the nation-state and a case, at some point, for global governance.
People are bored and irked. They can't get new jobs. They want new borders, especially as the likelihood of actually having to defend them in war has become infinitely remote.
They want to be cyberglobal and hyper-local, citizens of the world with the passports of microstates. The desires seem to balance each other.
Across the Atlantic there are similar trends. In Texas -- where Mitt Romney won by nearly 1.3 million votes -- secession chatter has increased. Larry Scott Kilgore, a Republican candidate, has announced he will run for governor in 2014 and legally change his name to Larry Secede Kilgore.
Texans, betraying an unlikely European itch, like to point out that the Texas economy is larger than Australia's [pdf]. Australia, meanwhile, has many citizens of Greek descent but is definitely not Greece.
As Tom Wolfe writes in his new novel, ''It's back to blood! Religion is dying ... but everybody still has to believe in something . It would be intolerable -- you couldn't stand it ... to finally have to say to yourself, 'Why keep pretending? I'm nothing but a random atom inside a supercollider known as the universe.'''
As economic difficulties increase so do tribal sentiments. Random-atom angst sends people scurrying for new flags even as 800 million borderless cyberfolk unite in watching ''Gangnam Style'' on YouTube.
Of course, immigration, lust and love have mixed the blood of the Scottish, Texan and Catalonian tribes (Call them ''Scottexalonia'' in their shared separation itch.) ''I'm a mutt,'' Barack Obama once said. So, increasingly, is a wired, remittance-linked world where many live with, say, one foot in Birmingham and another in Lahore.
Glasgow has a substantial Muslim population. Texas is more than a third Hispanic. Catalonia has many Spanish-only speaking immigrants. The urge to throw up new borders is in essence an anachronism.
Or is it? The euro crisis is perceived as a crisis of overreach for pooled sovereignty. Perhaps a reaction is rational (even if the Catalans and Scots say they would like to be in the E.U., once they run their own affairs.) Economic resentment translates into a resurgence of identity with national culture.
In Texas, where the terms of entry into the Union in 1845 are still debated, it is a little different. The main resentments are social not economic. Cohabiting with all the pointy-headed, Subaru-driving, pro-choice liberals who elected Obama is too much for some Texans.
In 1996, I began a piece called ''Global forces batter politics'' with these words: ''Throughout much of the world today, politics lags behind economics, like a horse and buggy haplessly trailing a sports car. While politicians go through the motions of national elections -- offering chimerical programs and slogans -- world markets, the Internet and the furious pace of trade involve people in a global game in which elected representatives figure as little more than bit players.''
Extrapolate out 16 years from that. National politics, as President Franois Hollande of France is only the latest to discover, is often no more than tweaking at the margins in the exiguous political space left by markets and other global forces. And that is in France!
Secessionist urges resonate in troubled times. But they face the headwind of business, political and global logic. I suspect that -- less Kosovo than Quebec -- all of Scottexalonia will succumb eventually to the good sense of union.

HEADLINE: Britain Selects a Canadian To Lead the Bank of England

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr. and JULIA WERDIGIER

 BODY:
LONDON -- In a surprising departure from convention, the British government on Monday selected Mark J. Carney, the head of the Canadian central bank, to succeed Mervyn A. King as the next governor of the Bank of England.
The appointment ended months of jockeying by some of Britain's most prominent public officials. As a result of changes to take effect next year, the job will come with sharply enhanced powers.
The odds had been seen as heavily favoring the Bank of England's deputy governor, Paul Tucker. The decision to select a foreigner to lead the bank, Britain's most storied financial institution and the equivalent of the Federal Reserve in the United States, came as a shock when George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, broke the news during a session of Parliament.
The appointment was arguably the most significant in the bank's 318-year history. Mr. Carney will not only be the first foreigner to lead the bank, but will also take responsibility for the health of the British financial system. 
Besides doing the traditional job of setting interest rates, the central bank will directly regulate and oversee the country's banks and other financial institutions. Until now, such regulation and oversight has been primarily the job of the Financial Services Authority, which will be scrapped.
''I see this as a challenge and I'm going to where the challenge is the greatest,'' Mr. Carney said at a news conference in Ottawa.
Mr. Carney will assume the governor's post in July, and the pressures facing him will be immense. Not only must he decide whether to continue Britain's aggressive money-printing program aimed at stimulating the economy, he must also ensure that the central bank's independence and reputation are not sullied by an investigation into the manipulation of key interest rates by commercial banks.
Indeed, the decision to pick Mr. Carney seems to have been heavily influenced by the taint of the interest-rate scandal that, although it has largely subsided, remains attached to Mr. Tucker.
As the scandal was erupting this year, the disclosure of e-mail exchanges dating to 2008 between Mr. Tucker and Robert E. Diamond Jr., the chief executive of Barclays at the time, suggested that Mr. Tucker might have supported the idea of keeping rates artificially low.
Mr. Carney, a former Goldman Sachs executive, is widely admired for the steady job he has done in preserving financial stability in Canada in the face of pressures that have shaken other countries.
The Bank of England's new heft represents a stark shift from the era of light regulation that held sway before the financial crisis, in which its ability to issue warnings and intervene in banking excesses were constrained.
''This is a new job,'' said Simon Hayes, an economist at Barclays. ''Previously, the focus was mainly on monetary policy. Now, it is about financial stability, monetary policy and macro-prudential policy. The key is to get the right mix of policy and making sure there is proper coordination'' with the Exchequer, or British Treasury.
Mr. King, who will remain as central bank governor until next summer, has emerged as Britain's most vociferous critic of irresponsible bank behavior. But he has also been criticized for acting too slowly in 2007 to bail out Northern Rock, the mortgage lender whose collapse that year was the onset of Britain's financial crisis.
The central bank's broader regulatory powers will be wielded by a newly formed Financial Policy Committee, operating inside the bank and presided over by the governor. The framers of the new structure hope the bank will be better able to sniff out early warning signals, like excessive risk-taking and borrowing by the banks, and move to defuse a crisis -- something it was not able to do in 2007.
Reflecting the importance of the position, Mr. Osborne cast a wide net in searching for a successor and took the unusual step of considering candidates from outside Britain. The names of prominent investment bankers also surfaced as potential chiefs, indicating the hunger for an innovative appointment.
Mr. Carney was encouraged this year by Mr. Osborne to apply for the governor role, according to a government official in London who declined to be identified because the chronology of Mr. Carney's appointment had not been made public. Mr. Carney ruled himself out of the race for the job in August, the official said, but remained in touch with Mr. Osborne, who, as one of Prime Minister David Cameron's top political advisers, has a fondness for grand gestures.
After further talks with senior officials in Britain, Mr. Carney reconsidered, applied for the post and was told of his appointment last week, the official said.
Mr. Osborne told Parliament that Mr. Carney was ''the best, most experienced and most qualified person in the world to do the job'' and that he would ''bring strong leadership and a fresh new perspective'' to the job.
Mr. Osborne pointed out that unlike some other candidates, Mr. Carney had both central bank and private sector experience.
''I look forward to working with Mark as we continue to rebalance our economy, deal with our debts, and equip Britain to succeed in the global race,'' Mr. Osborne told Parliament. ''We needed the best and in Mark Carney we've got it.''
Mr. Carney will also remain the head of the Financial Stability Board, the international body based in Basel, Switzerland, that is meant to ensure the health of the global financial system.
That position, along with Mr. Carney's experience in the private sector, made him a compelling candidate -- assuming he could be persuaded to take the job.
At Goldman, where he worked for 13 years, Mr. Carney's areas of responsibility included sovereign debt and emerging markets debt. The former is a particular asset, given the continuing crisis in the euro zone.
''He's highly regarded here and known for his strong but calm hand throughout the financial crisis,'' said Issa Mazen, a strategist at TD Securities in Toronto.
''Carney was decisive and responded firmly, understanding the scope and magnitude of the crisis. He's also a leading advocate on good communication and transparency.''
Mr. Carney received some renown late last year for being the target of an outburst from Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase. Mr. Dimon criticized Mr. Carney, who would soon become chairman of the Financial Stability Board, for his support of new rules dictating how much capital banks need to hold in reserve.
Mr. Carney stood his ground and in doing so enhanced his reputation as a hawkish regulator, both willing and able to resist the powerful bankers' lobby.
Such backbone will no doubt come in handy in Britain, where Mr. Carney will need to decide whether banks here should have their commercial and investment banking activities separated.
The decision came as a blow not only to Mr. Tucker, but also to Adair Turner, the chairman of the Financial Services Authority.
Mr. Tucker, who until the interest-rate scandal was seen to be a shoo-in to succeed Mr. King, has been at the central bank for close to 20 years and was widely recognized for his knowledge of the markets.
But with the continuing investigation into banks' manipulation of a key interest rate -- the London interbank offered rate, or Libor -- the risks were high that Mr. Tucker might be caught up in the scandal once again.
Mr. Turner, an economist with a flair for eye-opening speeches, was seen as the more politically adept candidate.
But the F.S.A. had been criticized for missing the onset of the crisis on his watch.

HEADLINE: Shareholders Expected to Back Bailout for Renesas

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Shareholders of the chip maker Renesas Electronics of Japan are close to approving a multibillion-dollar government-led bailout, three people familiar with the talks said Monday. The news lifted the company's shares 17 percent.
The deal could keep Renesas, the world's biggest maker of microcontroller chips, afloat for the next few years, but analysts said that despite job cuts and planned plant shutdowns, Renesas still faced many challenges, including the restructuring of the unprofitable unit that makes system chips. 
The state-backed Innovation Network will spend 180 billion, or $2.2 billion, to take a two-thirds stake in Renesas, which has been buffeted by strong overseas competition, production cuts by clients and fragile finances that have prevented it from improving its infrastructure.
As part of the bailout, eight manufacturers, including clients like Toyota Motor and Nissan Motor, will provide an additional combined 20 billion.
Shareholder approval of the deal, while expected, has been delayed for several weeks, and an announcement is now expected in early December, said the people, who declined to be identified, as the matter is not public. A Renesas spokesman said nothing had been decided.
Investors jumped to cover short positions in the stock, said Makoto Kikuchi, chief executive of Myojo Asset Management, noting that unlike some other troubled Japanese electronics companies, like Sharp, Renesas's expertise in chips for cars meant it was worth investing in.
The bailout was put together to counter a bid by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the U.S. private equity firm, amid worries that the company's technology would fall into foreign hands.
''As soon as stock investors see signs that the company is working hard to return to profit, they will be prepared to invest long-term,'' Mr. Kikuchi said.
Shares in Renesas closed up 16.6 percent at a two-month high, but were still down 42 percent since the beginning of April, the start of the Japanese financial year.
Recent history has been brutal for Japanese chip makers, and Renesas -- formed from the struggling chip divisions of its major shareholding companies, Hitachi, Mitsubishi Electric and NEC -- will be trying not to repeat mistakes of the bankrupt Elpida Memory.
Elpida, formed from the merger of units from several companies that made dynamic random-access memory chips, succumbed to slumping prices and competition from South Korean rivals. It is being acquired by Micron Technology of the United States.
The Japanese technology sector has also seen the creation of Japan Display, formed from the divisions of three television makers that manufacture small liquid crystal displays. The company has received investment funds from Innovation Network.
Renesas's bailout comes on top of 161 billion in syndicated loans from four Japanese banks in September. Before that, Renesas received 97 billion from banks and its major shareholders.
In return, the company has cut about 7,000 jobs this year and pledged to sell or close 8 of its 18 domestic plants within three years.
Renesas, which competes with Samsung Electronics and Freescale Semiconductor of the United States, has forecast a net loss of 150 billion for the year ending in March.
The newspaper Nikkei said Monday that Renesas would receive an additional 1 billion each in support from Hitachi and NEC. It was reported that the two companies would not take in Renesas employees; Mitsubishi Electric, however, is considering taking on some workers from the chip maker.
Meanwhile, Japanese government bond prices stabilized Monday. The benchmark 10-year bond yield was flat at 0.735 percent, near a nine-year low of 0.720 percent set in July.
Expectations that Shinzo Abe, the leader of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party, will push for aggressive monetary efforts to bolster the economy, however, helped bolster demand for ''superlongs,'' or bonds with 20-year and 30-year maturities. The 30-year yield fell 0.015 percentage point to 1.935 percent, and the 20-year yield also fell 0.015 percentage point to 1.67 percent.

HEADLINE: Audit Says Kabul Bank Began as 'Ponzi Scheme'

BYLINE: By MATTHEW ROSENBERG; Alissa J. Rubin and Sharifullah Sahak contributed reporting.

 BODY:
KABUL, Afghanistan -- Kabul Bank became Afghanistan's largest financial institution by offering the promise of modern banking to people who had never had a saving or checking account. What it really dealt in was modern theft: ''From its very beginning,'' according to a confidential forensic audit of Kabul Bank, ''the bank was a well-concealed Ponzi scheme.''
Afghan and American officials had for years promoted Kabul Bank as a prime example of how Western-style banking was transforming a war-ravaged economy. But the audit, prepared this year for Afghanistan's central bank by the Kroll investigative firm, gives new details of how the bank instead was institutionalizing fraud that reached into the hundreds of millions of dollars and obliterated Afghans' trust after regulators finally seized the bank in August 2010 and the theft was revealed.
Going further than previous reports, the audit asserts that Kabul Bank had little reason to exist other than to allow a narrow clique tied to President Hamid Karzai's government to siphon riches from depositors, who were the bank's only substantial source of revenue. 
At one point, Kroll's investigators found 114 rubber stamps for fake companies used to give forged documents a more legitimate look. And the auditing firms used by the bank never took issue with loan books that were ''almost entirely fraudulent,'' Kroll found, recommending that the Afghan government explore suing the last such auditor, A.F. Ferguson & Co., a private Pakistani firm with a franchise under PricewaterhouseCoopers.
When Afghan regulators, aided by American officials, first discovered the extent of the fraud at the bank in the summer of 2010, ''we never imagined that the criminality was as deep as it was, that it was so widespread and that it included high-ranking officials and their relatives,'' said Abdul Qadeer Fitrat, at the time the governor of the Bank of Afghanistan, the country's central bank.
''At the beginning, I received information from the U.S. Embassy that maybe $150 million or $200 million is gone in bad loans to powerful people,'' he said. The number soon climbed close to $900 million, though ''we did not know who took the loans and that they were all tied to a few individuals.''
What Kroll's audit found is that on Aug. 31, 2010, the day the Bank of Afghanistan seized Kabul Bank, more than 92 percent of the lender's loan portfolio -- $861 million, or roughly 5 percent of Afghanistan's annual economic output at the time -- had gone to 19 related people and companies, according to the audit.
Among the largest beneficiaries were a brother of Mr. Karzai and a brother of First Vice President Muhammad Qasim Fahim who each owned stakes in the bank that had been bought with loans from the bank, according to the audit and regulatory officials. For their part, both have insisted that they never took part in any fraud at the lender.
Reached for comment, Mr. Karzai's spokesman, Aimal Faizi, stressed that the president considered the audit incomplete: Mr. Karzai still believes Kroll has to find out where all the missing money has gone, to which countries it was sent and to which accounts if the firm wants the report to be seen as credible, Mr. Faizi said.
The New York Times obtained a copy of the 277-page audit report, which Afghan and Western officials have confirmed was the one Kroll prepared.
The two men that Afghan prosecutors, Western officials and the Kroll audit accuse of profiting most from the fraud were the bank's principal owners: Sherkhan Farnood, its chairman and a former World Series of Poker Europe winner, and his former bodyguard, Khalil Fruzi, who served as the bank's chief executive.
Working with the bank's executives, they devised simple, yet effective, schemes to fool weak and reluctant regulators, and the Americans who were advising them, the audit says.
The owners kept two sets of books, and hid loans to themselves and their shareholders by taking them in the names of friends, relatives and even domestic servants, according to the audit and Afghan officials. They grouped related loans together to better keep track of who owed what. Hundreds of millions of dollars in illicit loans were routed to Dubai through a money exchange controlled by Mr. Farnood, who founded the bank.
Kabul Bank employed people to forge documents for fictitious companies, which were then audited by accounting firms that appear to have been complicit, according to Kroll. That is where the rubber stamps came in: they bore the names of those false companies, like Abdul Mahmood Trading and Ali Jan Abdul Hadi Ltd., to lend an air of respectability to fake documents.
Toward the end, Mr. Fruzi even expensed foreign shopping sprees at stores like Louis Vuitton and Versace in Dubai and New Delhi. Mr. Farnood was snapping up villas in Dubai with bank money, though he has maintained they were investments gone bad, nothing more.
Bailing out depositors cost the cash-strapped Afghan government more than $825 million, and Afghan and Western officials say that only between $200 million and $400 million, depending on how assets are valued, has so far been recovered from shareholders.
For many Afghans, the scandal surrounding Kabul Bank, a linchpin of the economic order established here by Americans and their allies, has cemented the opinion that the United States brought crony capitalism, not free markets, to Afghanistan. The audit is likely to reinforce that view while raising potentially troubling questions about who is being prosecuted here in connection with the scandal, and who is not.
The United States and its allies have pressed hard for prosecutions, threatening to cut aid if no action was taken. The completion of the forensic audit, which was financed by international donors and delivered in March, was another demand by the international community, as was a separate report, due later this week, by an Afghan government-funded but largely independent corruption watchdog commission composed of Afghan and foreign experts.
Mr. Farnood and Mr. Fruzi top the list of 22 defendants charged so far, and both are on trial in Kabul. Many others on the list are Kabul Bank executives who are accused of helping to carry out fraud, though it is unclear whether they personally profited.
Few officials have any problem with those prosecutions. But there are questions about the charges brought by Afghan prosecutors against a few officials at Afghanistan's central bank. Western officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, expressed worries that those cases appeared to be intended to end further investigation into Kabul Bank. Kroll has said it has no evidence that the Bank of Afghanistan's staff members were complicit in Kabul Bank's collapse.
In the most prominent such case, the former chairman of the Bank of Afghanistan, Abdul Qadeer Fitrat, has been indicted primarily for failing to warn the Afghan government about Kabul Bank and concealing the fraud there -- an accusation that one Western official called ''laughable.'' Several Western and Afghan officials insist that Mr. Fitrat had actively pressed inquiries of Kabul Bank, and believed he had been indicted in order to scare him off. He fled the country last year.
Even Mr. Farnood said Mr. Fitrat had done nothing wrong: ''Fitrat was the one person who was not involved in any bribing,'' he said in a telephone interview.
The situation was particularly galling, the officials said, because apart from Mr. Farnood and Mr. Fruzi, the other ''high-value beneficiaries'' -- each of whom still owes at least $5 million to the bank, Kroll estimates -- have yet to face any legal action. That group includes Mahmood Karzai, the president's brother, and Haseen Fahim, the vice president's brother.
In an interview, Mahmood Karzai said he had repaid all the money he originally owed, an amount he put at $5.3 million. He insisted that Kroll had miscalculated and included assets he never owned, like a villa in Dubai, when it tallied his liability at $30.5 million.
He called Kroll ''a piece of puke'' and said it had relied too heavily on evidence provided by Mr. Farnood, who in the summer of 2010 began cooperating with American officials and, subsequently, Afghan investigators after a dispute with his fellow shareholders.
Neither Mr. Fahim nor Mr. Fruzi responded to phone messages seeking comment.
Kabul Bank did serve some legitimate functions -- for instance, the United States paid the salaries of hundreds of thousands of soldiers, police and teachers through it.
But many of the bank's practices seemed tailor-made to lure depositors by any means available. One popular gimmick detailed by the audit was known as a Bakht account, which offered those who opened them a chance to win houses, cars and jewelry at glitzy prize drawings.
The only real winners, however, were the bank's senior managers and their friends, the audit found. The new depositors' money was used principally ''to provide free financing to the other business interests of senior management and a group of connected persons.''

HEADLINE: Cravath Sets the Tone For Law Firm Bonuses

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
Every year around this time, the heads of the country's largest law firms weigh the size of year-end bonuses for their junior lawyers. And almost all ask the same question: What will Cravath pay?
Cravath refers to Cravath, Swaine & Moore, one of the country's oldest and most profitable law firms.
In a quirky tradition lacking a sound explanation but one by which the industry abides, Cravath is the first to announce bonuses paid to its associates, and then other firms follow, either matching those figures -- or not. 
On Monday, Cravath kicked off bonus season by announcing year-end bonuses that were substantially higher than they had been the previous two years, reflecting a strong performance for the law firm, which is based in New York. Bonuses will range from $10,000 for the most junior lawyers to $60,000 for senior associates, according to an internal Cravath memo.
Deborah Farone, a spokeswoman for Cravath, declined to comment.
Cravath's announcement surprised some competitors and legal industry experts. Four years after the global economic crisis, business remains challenging, squeezing the financial results of corporate law firms. But Cravath's pay bump will pressure competitors to increase their year-end bonuses or risk alienating their junior lawyers.
''For years, Cravath has set the bar for what it pays its associates, and other law firms follow them like lemmings to avoid any negative inference about their financial strength,'' said Bruce MacEwen, a law firm consultant who publishes the Web site Adam Smith, Esq. ''And they need to reassure their associates that they're a top-tier firm.''
Cravath has had a busy year. Large mergers-and-acquisition assignments included advising Hertz Global Holdings on its acquisition of the Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group, and Grupo Modelo in its combination with Anheuser-Busch InBev. On the litigation side, it is representing Credit Suisse and JPMorgan Chase in various lawsuits related to mortgage-backed securities, and American Express in antitrust litigation.
Starting salaries for first-year lawyers at Cravath and many other large New York firms is $160,000. Cravath ranks as the fifth most profitable firm in the country, according to The American Lawyer magazine, with profits per partner of $3.1 million.
But when spring bonuses are added to the equation, there has been little increase for Cravath's associates over the last two years. The law firm did not award spring bonuses in 2012, but last year paid its associates a small stipend in addition to a year-end reward. When 2011's spring and year-end bonuses are added together, total bonus compensation actually exceeds this year's level.
In any case, this year's numbers are still far below the year-end bonuses before the 2008 financial crisis. For 2007, for example, Cravath paid bonuses ranging from $35,000 to $110,000.
Since the crisis, business has been difficult. Corporate clients, themselves wrestling with difficult business conditions, are demanding reduced fees from their outside counsel. And while law firms have seen an uptick in lucrative merger-and-acquisition assignments from the lows of a couple of years ago, deal activity is nowhere near what it once was. A recent study by Wells Fargo's legal industry group said that demand for legal services remained weak and that, as a result, hiring had lagged.
This also was the year of the largest law firm collapse ever, when the New York law firm Dewey & LeBoeuf dissolved after filing for bankruptcy protection in May, costing hundreds of lawyers their jobs. Most Dewey lawyers, however, have landed at other firms.

HEADLINE: Retailers' Discounts Worry Investors

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The stock market mostly slipped on Monday, pulling back from last week's gains in Thanksgiving-shortened trading, as retailers fell on concerns about heavy discounts at the start of the holiday shopping season and the overhang of federal budget negotiations kept investors wary of making big bets. 
The Nasdaq composite index closed higher, led by gains in eBay and Apple. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index cut most of its losses during Monday's trading session and remained above its 200-day moving average, maintaining its long-term upward trend.
The S.& P. 500 consumer discretionary index fell 0.5 percent after the start of the holiday shopping season over the four-day Thanksgiving weekend. Target, one of the largest retailers by market value, fell $1.71, or 2.6 percent, to $62.78.
''The concern is big retailers are discounting so much, sales look better, but at what cost?'' said Angel Mata, managing director of listed equity trading at Stifel Nicolaus Capital Markets.
Bucking the retail trend, shares of eBay closed at their highest in almost eight years, rising $2.39, or 4.9 percent, to $51.40, as the online marketplace posted strong sales on Cyber Monday. Amazon gained $3.74, or 1.6 percent, to $243.62.
The White House showed little enthusiasm on Monday for a proposal to avoid the fiscal shock of tax increases and spending cuts to take effect at the first of the year by limiting tax deductions and loopholes, instead of allowing tax rates to rise for the richest Americans.
Investors are hoping for advances in Congressional talks over the more than $600 billion in spending cuts and tax increases that threaten to drag the American economy back into recession.
Indications of progress in talks, or just a political willingness to negotiate, contributed to the market's recent rally. Major indexes last week gained 3 to 4 percent; the Dow Jones industrial average moved above 13,000 and the S.&P. 500 above 1,400 for the first time since Nov. 6.
On Monday, the Dow industrials fell 42.31 points, or 0.33 percent, to 12,967.37. The S.& P. 500 dropped 2.86 points, or 0.20 percent, to 1,406.29. The Nasdaq gained 9.93 points, or 0.33 percent, to 2,976.78.
Apple, a big mover in the Nasdaq, jumped $18.03, or 3.2 percent, to $589.53. The company said on Friday that it had asked a federal court to add six more products to its patent infringement lawsuit against Samsung Electronics, including the Samsung Galaxy Note II, the latest move in the continuing legal war between the two companies.
In the bond market, interest rates slipped. The price of the Treasury's 10-year note rose 8/32, to 99 20/32, while its yield fell to 1.67 percent, from 1.69 percent on Friday.

HEADLINE: After Drought, Reducing Water Flow Could Hurt Mississippi River Transport

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
The drought of 2012 has already caused restrictions on barge traffic up and down the Mississippi River. But things are about to get a lot worse.
As part of an annual process, the Army Corps of Engineers has begun reducing the amount of water flowing from the upper Missouri River into the Mississippi, all but ensuring that the economically vital river traffic will be squeezed even further. If water levels fall low enough, the transport of $7 billion in agricultural products, chemicals, coal and petroleum products in December and January alone could be stalled altogether. 
''Without the river, we're in a world of hurt,'' said Kathy Mathers, a spokeswoman for the Fertilizer Institute. About half of the spring fertilizer that the industry sells to Midwestern farmers travels upriver, she said, and options to get the fertilizer to the fields by other means are few. ''We know the rail cars aren't there,'' she said. The corps reduces water flow from the upper Missouri every year as part of its master plan for maintaining irrigation systems and meeting other water needs of the region, which stretches from Montana to St. Louis. This year the process began on Nov. 11, as the corps began reducing water flows from the Gavins Point Dam near Yankton, S.D. The flow has already been reduced from 37,500 cubic feet per second to 26,500, and will reach 12,000 by Dec. 11.
The plan, approved by Congress, has the power of law. ''We do not have the legal authority to operate the Missouri River solely for the benefits of the Mississippi River,'' said Monique Farmer, a spokeswoman for the corps.
Michael Toohey, the chief executive of the Waterways Council, a group that lobbies on behalf of inland carriers, operators and ports, said that argument rings hollow. ''The corps could do it,'' he said. ''They have the authority to do it. They don't have the will to do it.''
Water levels on the Mississippi near St. Louis are approaching record lows -- and whether or not the Coast Guard actually closes down navigation, the effect on shipping will be the same, said Martin Hettel, a senior manager at the American Electric Power River Operations. ''Economics will shut the river down,'' he said.
Carriers have so far responded to low water by loading barges with less cargo so that they will ride higher in the water, reducing their own efficiency. But as the river level continues to drop, Mr. Hettel said, ''you can load the barges lighter, but if you don't have a light-draft towboat you can't move them.''
The effects, he predicted, will not be felt by businesses alone. ''When the cost of shipping raw materials goes up, the consumer ends up paying for that,'' he said.
Maj. Gen. John W. Peabody, the commander of the Mississippi Valley division of the corps, said at a Nov. 16 news conference in St. Louis that the corps has been actively dredging the river and has released smaller amounts of water from other reservoirs, but has to think about long-term response to the drought. ''Some people compare this to a battle,'' he said, but ''I compare it to a campaign -- this is not something we can solve in a few days, or a few weeks, or even if a few months if we have a persistent enough drought.'' He added, ''We're going to have to husband our resources for when the situation gets truly dire -- and in my personal estimate, we are not there yet.''
The reservoirs along the upper Missouri are already 20 percent below the levels that normally get the region through the coming year's drought season and that allow commercial navigation on the Missouri between April and November, said Charles Shadie, chief of the watershed division for the Mississippi Valley division; ''they are already concerned that they may not have a full navigation season on the Missouri next year.''
The corps is also taking on a blasting project, which will allow traffic to proceed despite the low water levels. The project will eliminate rock formations known as pinnacles in Southern Illinois at Thebes and Grand Tower, but the work is not projected to begin until February. Fifteen senators and 62 House members have asked for the government to speed up the process.
Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, who was the principal author of the Senate letter, said that disrupting traffic along the Mississippi, ''has the potential to impact the entire economy along the river -- everything from increasing the cost to move goods to potential job losses.''
He called for President Obama to issue an emergency declaration to increase water flow from the Missouri and to get rid of the pinnacles quickly.
''The only person that's going to be able help us is the person who lives at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,'' Mr. Hettel said. ''Unless we get rain.''
At the St. Louis news conference, General Peabody jokingly recommended an appeal to an even higher authority. ''If anybody knows how to create rain upriver of where we are today, I encourage you to leverage the impact that you have,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Fierce Debt Puts Pensions at Risk In Puerto Rico

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH; Rafael Matos contributed reporting from San Juan, P.R.

 BODY:
Puerto Rico is fighting to stay afloat in a rising sea of debt.
Its economy is sputtering. Its population is shrinking. Its recent election is disputed. Its public pension fund is perilously low on cash. The American territory has just been through a brutal five-year recession, something not experienced in the United States as a whole since the 1930s.
Desperate to raise cash, Puerto Rican officials have been selling off anything they can: two toll roads and the main airport so far.
To bring in tax revenue, they are trying to lure people out of the underground economy. Coffee shops, hairdressers, even outdoor market stalls are being required to issue printed receipts with every sale. The receipts carry a lottery number, with a chance to win cars or cash, as an incentive to get shoppers to pay the island's 7 percent sales tax. 
Though many of Puerto Rico's problems are reminiscent of Greece's -- tax noncompliance, a stagnant economy, years of issuing long-term debt to cover short-term payments -- investors have had a nearly insatiable appetite for its bonds.
But now their support is dwindling. Some big investors are pruning their holdings. That is beginning to widen the cost of borrowing for Puerto Rico relative to other states and municipalities, which are benefiting from a big decline in borrowing costs. The interest rate its 30-year bonds now pay is about 2.5 percentage points higher than other municipal borrowers', up from a difference of just 1.5 percentage points at the beginning of 2012, according to Municipal Market Data.
The possibility of a credit downgrade also hangs in the air, something that could lead to more selling.
''There is no specific event looming on the horizon,'' said Alan Schankel, a managing director at Janney Capital Markets in Philadelphia. ''But it's a problem of immense magnitude, and it's very challenging to sit here and see how they work their way out of it.''
Puerto Rico needs to be able to issue bonds at attractive rates to cover its short-term financing needs. Perhaps more important, it has to figure out how to salvage its retirement funds. After shortchanging them for years, it now has the weakest major public pension system in America.
The main fund, which serves about 250,000 government workers, past and present, is only 6 percent funded -- a small percentage of what is considered the minimum needed for a marginally healthy pension plan -- and could run out of money as soon as 2014. Another fund, for about 80,000 teachers, which is 20 percent funded, will last just a few years longer if nothing is done. Police officers and teachers in Puerto Rico have opted out of Social Security and rely entirely on their pensions.
''For now, I'm not totally shaken about the possibility of the fund going broke,'' said Jorge Ramn Romn, a 78-year-old retired instructor for the island's Civil Air Patrol. ''But I do fear for the future, when I'll be an even older person, more infirm and with less of a pension.''
Hctor M. Mayol Kauffman, the executive director of the pension system, said it would be impossible to cut the benefits of people who are already retired, citing court precedent.
Puerto Rican officials were racing this fall to put together a rescue plan for the pension fund. Voters, though, pushed out Gov. Luis Fortuo, who had tried austerity measures that included cutting tens of thousands of government workers along with a revamping of the fund.
They elected Alejandro Garca Padilla, who promised to create 50,000 new jobs in the next 18 months. But the margin was razor-thin and Mr. Fortuo has requested a recount. Mr. Garca Padilla's party had dropped out of the retirement overhaul effort, but the governor-elect says he will deal with the looming pension crisis with ''diligence and promptness'' and has put together a task force of economists and financial advisers.
''We will not leave retired government workers stranded at a bus stop in their older years,'' he said.
Since the election, yields on the island's 30-year bonds have continued to widen.
''I don't think that there's a default that's about to happen, but a default isn't the only bad thing that can happen when you've got bonds,'' Mr. Schankel said. Puerto Rico's bonds are just a notch or two above junk status. If they fall to that level, at least some institutions would be forced to sell, potentially setting off a chain reaction. And individual investors could get a jolt if they saw the value of their holdings fall. Many people own Puerto Rican debt without knowing it, through their mutual funds.
''The concern is that Puerto Rico is a systemic risk to the municipal bond market because it's so widely held,'' said Robert Donahue, a managing director with Municipal Market Advisors.
Three days after the election, Standard & Poor's, citing ''prolonged inaction on pension reforms,''said there was at least a one-in-three chance that it would downgrade Puerto Rico's credit by early 2013.
Juan Carlos Batlle, president of Puerto Rico's Government Development Bank, called the warning ''a bit premature,'' in testimony before the new government's transition committee, saying that the new government would maintain fiscal discipline.
The central question for Governor-elect Garca Padilla is the same one that faced his predecessor: How to get Puerto Rico's economy growing fast.
In addition to selling assets and restructuring bonds to postpone payments due, officials have also been pitching Puerto Rico as a hot new tax haven for hedge funds, real estate investors and other high-paying businesses, hoping to attract jobs and spur growth.
That strategy has worked in the past, attracting a number of big pharmaceutical companies -- but last year Mr. Fortuo's government hit those companies with a big excise tax, to help pay for tax cuts for nearly everyone else. There are hopes that the United States Treasury will grant the affected companies a separate tax break, to cushion the blow.
Manufacturing jobs have been dwindling for years, and the economy went into a tailspin in 2006, after lawmakers hit an impasse and the government ran out of cash, forcing a two-week shutdown. Puerto Rico created a special entity, called the Cofina, much like the Municipal Assistance Corporation that helped New York City stay afloat during the fiscal crisis of 1975.
The Cofina has borrowed to balance the budget every year and has virtually used up its $15 billion borrowing capacity. But the budget deficit, while smaller than before, keeps coming back. In 2009, it was $2.9 billion, according to the Center for the New Economy, a research group in San Juan; now it is closer to $1 billion.
Outstanding public debt has exploded to about $67 billion, although tallies differ depending on what types of debt are counted. Relative to personal income, Puerto Rico's public debt is almost 10 times that of Hawaii, which has the highest debt-to-income ratio of the 50 states, according to Moody's Investors Service.
Puerto Rico does not have the extra $2 billion a year it would need to pay its retirees if it exhausts its retirement fund. A collapse of the fund would set off a broader fiscal emergency, with officials forced to make excruciating choices among paying schoolteachers and the police, fixing the roads, providing drinking water and paying all those far-flung bondholders on time.
Republican members of the Joint Economic Committee warned this fall that some state pension funds were at risk of running out of money, and ''governors and mayors will inevitably come to Washington requesting bailouts.''
The group recommended imposing penalties now -- like federal aid cuts -- on laggard states, to show that bailouts were out of the question. The report, issued in September, did not mention territories, however.
An outside audit of Puerto Rico's pension system in 2009 found that it had been mismanaged practically from its inception in 1951. Lawmakers never appropriated enough money to cover the benefits, but layered on more and more extras -- Christmas bonuses, summer bonuses, medication bonuses, health plan contributions, and others. There was even a provision that allowed people to enlarge their lifetime benefits by 50 percent with a single day's extra work.
Mr. Ramn said his benefits were not exactly princely -- after 31 years of service, he gets just $1,000 a month and the government deducts health premiums from it.
But even modest benefits can be costly when retirees draw them over many years -- Mr. Ramn retired at 54, for example -- and when the government fails to set aside anywhere near enough money in advance.
Mr. Ramn said he was following news about the pension fund intently.
''I am quite aware that this is not a problem unique to Puerto Rico,'' he said, ''but that doesn't calm your nerves.''

HEADLINE: In Aid Appeal, Cuomo Cites Broad Reach Of Hurricane

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN and RAYMOND HERNANDEZ; David W. Chen contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, making a case for tens of billions of dollars in federal aid, declared on Monday that Hurricane Sandy had been ''more impactful'' than Hurricane Katrina, the deadly storm that struck the Gulf Coast in 2005.
Hurricane Sandy, which arrived in New Jersey and New York on Oct. 29, ''affected many, many more people and places than Katrina,'' Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, told reporters at a news briefing. He said the comparison between the two hurricanes ''puts this entire conversation, I believe, in focus.'' 
Mr. Cuomo said the recent storm would cost New York State nearly $42 billion, and he huddled in his Midtown office with the state's Congressional delegation, as well as Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and the Nassau, Suffolk and Westchester County executives, to strategize on lobbying Washington for financial assistance.
Mr. Cuomo acknowledged that more people had been killed by Hurricane Katrina, but said that Hurricane Sandy had had a greater economic impact because of the dense population in the New York City area. He said Hurricane Sandy had destroyed or damaged more units of housing, affected more businesses and caused more customers to lose power.
Mr. Cuomo said he believed it would cost nearly $33 billion to pay for storm cleanup, including more than $15 billion in New York City, and an additional $9 billion to prepare for future storms. Aides to Mr. Bloomberg said he was expected to meet with House and Senate leaders on Wednesday.
Some of the amounts in the aid request were staggering: the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which totaled its damages at $4.8 billion, said it would cost $600 million just to repair the South Ferry-Whitehall Street subway stop in Lower Manhattan.
Mr. Cuomo, Mr. Bloomberg and the New York lawmakers, mindful that President Obama and Congressional leaders in both parties are preparing for difficult negotiations on a deficit reduction plan, acknowledged that their request would not be easily won.
''This will be an effort that lasts not weeks, but many months,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, a Democrat.
Yet several Republicans in the Congressional delegation predicted that their Republican colleagues in the House would be more accommodating to the state's request for aid now that the governor has presented a plan that lays out the needs of the city and state in stark terms.
''This is a bare-bones request,'' said Representative Michael G. Grimm, a Republican whose district includes areas on Staten Island that were devastated by the storm. ''This is not based on want. It is based on need.''
Representative Peter T. King, a Republican from Long Island, agreed, saying ''there's nothing exaggerated'' in the governor's aid request. ''We have to convince Congress that this is an absolute necessity,'' he said.
Several lawmakers are pushing to have Congress approve additional disaster aid before it adjourns this year, arguing that any urgency to deal with the matter now will almost certainly fade as the weeks pass and lawmakers turn their attention to other matters.
''It has to happen, as far as I am concerned, now,'' said Representative Nita M. Lowey, a Democrat from Westchester who is a senior member of the Appropriations Committee. ''This is an emergency.''
A spokesman for the House speaker, John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, declined to comment until the White House has submitted a request for supplemental funds to pay for disaster recovery efforts.
But Mr. King said Mr. Boehner had committed to providing money to New York State and New Jersey without demanding spending cuts that would offset the appropriations. (New Jersey estimates its cost at nearly $30 billion.)
And Mr. Cuomo, who has not been to Washington since taking office nearly two years ago, invited Mr. Boehner to come see the damage himself and offered to travel to Capitol Hill to lobby the speaker.
''I understand the fiscal pressures that Washington is under,'' Mr. Cuomo said. ''I also understand the fiscal pressure that New York is under. And I know that the taxpayers of New York cannot shoulder this burden, and I don't think it's fair to ask them to shoulder this burden.''

HEADLINE: Man Displaced in Storm Dies After Being Struck by 2 Cars

BYLINE: By J. DAVID GOODMAN

 BODY:
If it had not been for Hurricane Sandy, Thomas Lewis would not have found himself dislocated from his apartment in Seaside Heights, N.J.
He would not have walked to a bowling alley near Crossland Economy Studios in Maple Shade, N.J., on Saturday night, a motel jammed into a highway interchange where he and others displaced by the storm had found temporary housing.
And in all probability, Mr. Lewis's loved ones would not be mourning his death. 
Two cars struck Mr. Lewis just after 1 a.m. in the northbound lanes of Route 73 as he was crossing near Route 38, according to the police in Maple Shade, a community across the state from his home on the Jersey Shore. Both drivers stayed at the scene and cooperated with the police.
For Mr. Lewis, 36, and his girlfriend, Michelle Barreto, 38, the evening had been a rare chance to infuse a bit of fun into a difficult situation.
''We hadn't been anywhere since the hurricane,'' she said. Just before the crash, she had stopped to tighten her scarf. ''Then I see him get hit,'' she said.
It was an abrupt end to a life that had been getting back on track, his brother Jonathan said. ''This Thanksgiving was the happiest I'd seen him in a long time,'' he said.
Born on July 4, 1976, Mr. Lewis, a lifelong Red Sox fan with a team tattoo on his calf, spent his youth swatting baseballs in Toms River, N.J. In his late teens, he got into graffiti art and promoted club parties at the Limelight in Manhattan.
Mr. Lewis was a middle child from a sprawling brood -- seven boys, three girls -- but the oldest of three boys born to both of his parents, Blanca and William Lewis. Their divorce set in motion a series of moves that would characterize much of Mr. Lewis's life, his brother said.
As some of his brothers went off to South Korea to teach English or to Kuwait to serve in the United States Army, Mr. Lewis stayed in New Jersey, following in his father's footsteps and starting his own business, cleaning and fixing gutters.
After the business fell on hard times, Mr. Lewis bounced around different construction jobs. A long relationship ended badly; the next also ended in acrimony, but with a young son, Aiden, who will turn 5 next week.
''He loved his son and was really really trying to be able to see him again,'' his sister Lizbeth Mahoney said. ''There were custody issues.'' Mr. Lewis's last Facebook message, posted on Nov. 22, was addressed to his son.
Mr. Lewis struggled with substance abuse over the years, his brother said, but seemed to be putting his life back together with Ms. Barreto, a friend since high school. ''We had plans,'' she said. They lived together in Seaside Heights until the storm throttled the town, forcing Mr. Lewis to move again. His landlord, Larry Haress, said the property had been largely spared.
Mr. Haress said he had seen Mr. Lewis two weeks ago fetching belongings at the apartment. The couple had been looking to move to Toms River, his sister said.
''I don't know what he had been through before,'' Mr. Haress said. ''You could see that he was trying to get himself together, to start again.''

HEADLINE: Congressional Proposal Could Create 'Tax Bubble'

BYLINE: By NATE SILVER

 BODY:
The coming Congressional debate over fiscal policy is sure to feature a wide array of proposals, some of which would hit certain taxpayers harder than others.
But one idea being floated by Congressional negotiators, as described in an article by The New York Times's Jonathan Weisman on Thursday, is hard to defend from the standpoint of rational public policy making.
Its arithmetic could require that the 300,000th dollar of income was taxed at a rate of about 50 percent - even while the three millionth dollar of income, or the three billionth, was taxed at a lower 35 percent rate instead.
The math behind these calculations is not all that complicated. It's just a matter of understanding how marginal tax rates work. 
Take an American who earns $400,000 a year in taxable income. (This is roughly the threshold at which a taxpayer reaches the top 1 percent of households.)
The top marginal federal income tax rate is now 35 percent, and kicks in at earnings above $388,350.
Someone making $400,000 is above the $388,350 threshold. Does this mean that she'd be taxed at a 35 percent rate on all $400,000 of income, meaning that she'd owe the government $140,000?
Not under current law. Instead, only a small fraction of the taxpayer's income - the $11,650 she earns after she's already reached $388,350 - is taxed at the top 35 percent rate.
This is because the tax rates are applied on a marginal basis. For every dollar that a taxpayer earns up to $8,700, she owes the federal government 10 cents in taxes - regardless of how much money she makes thereafter.
The government then taxes 15 cents of every dollar once the taxpayer reaches $8,701 in income, and continuing until she has earned $35,350. There are several more steps in the scale until the taxpayer reaches the top marginal rate.
Because tax rates are applied in this way, a taxpayer making $400,000 would owe about $117,000 in federal taxes, or about 29 percent of her earnings - rather than $140,000 if all her income had been taxed at the 35 percent rate.
Under the proposal described in Mr. Weisman's article, that would change.
"One possible change would tax the entire salary earned by those making more than a certain level - $400,000 or so - at the top rate of 35 percent rather than allowing them to pay lower rates before they reach the target, as is the standard formula," he reports.
In other words, under this proposal, the taxpayer making $400,000 would in fact pay 35 percent in overall income taxes and would owe $140,000 - about $23,000 more than she does currently.
The question is when the government would collect the additional $23,000 of taxes.
The most theoretically extreme case is if the government collected all of the additional taxes when the taxpayer made her 400,000th dollar of income exactly. That is, the taxpayer would owe about $117,000 in taxes if she made $399,999, but $140,000 if she made $400,000 instead. Thus, that one additional dollar of income would cost the taxpayer about $23,000 in taxes.
Of course, the government might never see the money, since the taxpayer might do everything in her power to avoid crossing the $400,000 threshold.
Here's the problem: the government would now want to collect 35 percent of the taxpayer's overall income, when it had been billing her at a lower rate on almost all the income she had earned so far.
If the government simply started collecting 35 percent of every dollar she earned above a certain threshold, it would have no way to make up for the lower rates it had been charging her previously.
Instead, it needs to make up the deficit somewhere to collect that additional $23,000 of taxes. It can only accomplish that by making the tax rate greater than 35 percent on at least some of the income that she has received.
For example, the taxpayer might be asked to pay additional taxes on the $150,000 of earnings between $250,000 and $400,000. To collect the extra $23,000, the government would need to tax this income at a rate of about 15 percent - in addition to the marginal tax rates that are already applied under current law, which now range between 33 and 35 percent.
Thus, the taxpayer would owe close to 50 percent in federal income taxes on earnings between $250,000 and $400,000. (If state taxes and Medicare taxes are also considered, her marginal tax rate could be close to 60 percent in some states.)
Perhaps you think that someone earning $300,000 or $400,000 should be taxed much more than they are now. There is still a perversity introduced by this proposal.
Specifically, after the taxpayer had hit her 400,000th dollar of income, her marginal tax rate would then decline. Rather than owing 50 cents for each dollar earned, she'd be back to a 35 percent rate instead.
Suppose that the taxpayer is considering taking on a part-time job that would make her an additional $50,000 in income. If the taxpayer had already earned $3,000,000 in income from her main job, then she would be able to keep 65 percent of the additional income from her side gig, owing 35 percent or $17,500 in taxes.
But if the taxpayer had "only" made $300,000 from her main job, she would get to keep only about $25,000 of earnings from her second job, owing the other $25,000 to the government. Faced with this steep tax rate, the taxpayer might decline the second job, meaning that the government would never collect the additional revenues from her earnings.
This is what's known as a "tax bubble": when someone earning less income might be taxed at a higher marginal rate than someone making more.
Tax bubbles have existed at various times in the federal tax code, such as from 1986 through 1990. They also exist in some state tax codes. But the proposal described in Mr. Weisman's article would create an especially steep one.
To be clear, the people subjected to the tax bubble would be reasonably well off. An average family making $50,000 a year would not pay any additional taxes because of it, nor would its incentives be distorted in any substantial way.
Also to be clear: many of the people writing about tax policy, from academic economists to yours truly, make incomes that are considerably above the national average.
Nonetheless, the proposal described in Mr. Weisman's article would place its heaviest tax burden on the somewhat wealthy as opposed to the very wealthy, particularly as it is being proposed as an alternative to raising the top marginal rate.
If the tax bubble were implemented, but the tax code were otherwise unchanged, then someone making $400,000 would owe $140,000 in federal income taxes, $23,000 more than she does now, increasing her overall tax rate to 35 percent from about 29 percent.
Someone making $4 million would owe $1.4 million in taxes, also reflecting a $23,000 increase. But the increase would be minimal on a percentage basis, since it comes from a larger pool of income. Their overall tax rate would rise to 35.0 percent from 34.4 percent.
If, instead, the top two marginal tax rates were increased to 36 percent and 39.6 percent, as they were under the Clinton administration, then someone making $400,000 would owe about $124,000 in federal income taxes - or about 31 percent of her income. This would reflect a tax increase, but less than under the tax bubble proposal.
However, the government would collect more taxes from the $4 million earner. Someone making that much would owe $1.55 million if the Clinton-era rates were restored, with their tax rate rising to 38.7 percent from 34.4 percent.
Either policy would reflect a tax increase - whatever semantics the Congress might use to describe it. It's a question of which taxpayers would bear more of the burden.
It's also a question of whether the tax increase would make the tax code more efficient or less so. One might favor a flatter schedule of marginal tax rates or a steeper one. All taxes have the potential to discourage work. But smoother increases in marginal tax rates, asunder current law, create less economic friction, and fewer deadweight losses, then those with a number of peaks and valleys. It is hard to see the economic rationale for creating a bubble in the middle of the tax code.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

GRAPHIC: CHART: A Higher Rate for Some: One tax proposal being considered by Congress could result in a ''bubble,'' in which a taxpayer in a certain income range is taxed at a higher rate than one earning more. In this hypothetical example, the bubble occurs in the $250,000 to $400,000 range.

HEADLINE: China's Leadership Change Puts Pair Ahead of Their Peers for 2017

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG; Jonathan Ansfield contributed reporting. Patrick Zuo and Amy Qin contributed research.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- When American diplomats in China scanned the political landscape this year for officials on a fast track to the Communist Party's top ranks, one name jumped out: Hu Chunhua.
So in June, the United States ambassador, Gary F. Locke, traveled to Inner Mongolia, the coal-rich region of grasslands and boom cities, where Mr. Hu is party chief. At a banquet in Hohhot, the regional capital, Mr. Hu proudly opened a bottle of local liquor, and Mr. Locke joined in a toast.
Mr. Hu's rising star got brighter this month when he was named one of 15 new members on the party's 25-seat Politburo. Political analysts say he could be on track to ascend to the Politburo's elite Standing Committee at the next party congress, in 2017. That would put him in the running for the top party job -- and the mantle of leader of China -- when Xi Jinping, the new party chief, steps down after his expected two five-year terms. 
Mr. Hu is the most prominent of a clutch of political stars known as China's ''sixth generation.'' They were handpicked by party leaders and elders years ago to succeed Mr. Xi's fifth generation (the first generation was that of Mao Zedong). Now, those politicians are being slotted into some of the most important posts across China.
Political insiders say Mr. Hu will probably be sent soon to Guangdong, a coastal province that is central to China's export economy. His closest rival, Sun Zhengcai, whom Mr. Locke also met this year, was posted earlier this month to Chongqing, the booming southwest municipality of 31 million once run by Bo Xilai, the disgraced party aristocrat.
If Mr. Hu and Mr. Sun both make it onto the Standing Committee in 2017, they would be in position to vie for the top two party posts in 2022, which would confer on them the state titles of president or premier.
Even as prominent voices across China are calling for greater political openness and a more democratic selection process, the promotions suggest that party leaders want to institutionalize the path to power that elders laid out in back-room deals for Mr. Xi and the new second-ranking party member, Li Keqiang. The two were the only fifth-generation officials selected for the Standing Committee in 2007, putting them ahead of their peers.
Mr. Hu and Mr. Sun, both 49, are the youngest members of the Politburo, and their new postings would be aimed at giving them exposure to the economic engines of China's main industrial centers before they ascended further.
''The fact that they're in the Politburo makes them far more competitive than others,'' said Cheng Li, a scholar of Chinese politics at the Brookings Institution. ''They'll be tested in their current positions, but the tests work in their favor unless something terrible happens.''
Mr. Hu and Mr. Sun grew up during the Cultural Revolution; they were in their formative teenage and young adult years during the dawn of Deng Xiaoping's ''reform and opening'' era in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when China experimented with market-economy policies and gradually opened to the world. The two men are better educated than most older leaders: Mr. Hu has a degree in Chinese literature from Peking University; Mr. Sun received a doctorate from China Agricultural University. While earning that degree, Mr. Sun studied in Britain for a half-year.
By some accounts, they are on opposite sides of the two competing patronage networks that have dominated Chinese politics in the post-Deng era. In broad terms, the main power centers revolve around Hu Jintao, 69, who just stepped down as party chief and civilian head of the military, and Jiang Zemin, his predecessor. A third pole is expected to emerge, as Mr. Xi, 59, who became the new party chief with the strong support of Mr. Jiang, tries to consolidate his power and move allies into important posts.
This year, Mr. Jiang, 86, though retired, quietly exerted enormous influence during the leadership transition to ensure that five of his allies got on to the seven-member Standing Committee. A central question in the coming years is how long Mr. Jiang will stay in decent health; last year, he suffered a severe illness.
Five Standing Committee members are expected to retire in 2017 because of an age limit. That means negotiations for those seats are already starting in earnest. Hu Jintao is expected to push hard for the younger Mr. Hu, who is no relation but is known as ''Little Hu,'' to get on the committee in the next round. Mr. Sun, meanwhile, is said by Mr. Cheng and several other analysts to be a protg of Jia Qinglin, who recently stepped down from the Standing Committee and is close to Mr. Jiang. But there is also talk that Wen Jiabao, who is scheduled to retire as premier in March, could be another patron of Mr. Sun.
As Mr. Xi builds his power base, he may have as much say as Mr. Hu and Mr. Jiang over committee seats and other senior posts. That could throw a wrench into the current maneuvering by elders to secure prime jobs for the younger Mr. Hu, Mr. Sun and other sixth-generation stars, like Zhou Qiang, the party chief of Hunan Province and another protg of Hu Jintao.
''Whether or not they'll be able to take power and rule China is still a question mark,'' said an editor of a party publication, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of security concerns. ''The question for these leaders isn't whether or not they're capable. The key is whether or not Xi likes them.''
He added: ''If Xi likes someone, this person won't have any problems. But if Xi doesn't like him, then one crisis could end his prospects of a top job.''
It is unclear what kind of relationships Mr. Hu and Mr. Sun have with Mr. Xi. Neither is one of the princelings, the children of notable party leaders from an earlier generation, as Mr. Xi and most other members of his network are.
Mr. Hu and Mr. Sun were born into farming families, and each took a different path to the Politburo. After graduating from university in 1983, Mr. Hu worked in party organizations in Tibet and advanced through the Communist Youth League. At the time, Hu Jintao, also a Youth League stalwart, was the party chief of Tibet, and he became a mentor to the younger Hu.
The two Hus share a policy outlook: Both say China needs to better distribute the benefits of growth since rural areas lag far behind coastal provinces.
After a stint in Hebei Province, during which he avoided being implicated in an infamous scandal over tainted milk, Mr. Hu became party chief of Inner Mongolia. From 2009 onward, he has dealt with rising ethnic tensions. Rural residents of Inner Mongolia, many of them Mongolian herders, have come to resent the growing presence of mining companies, which are generally run by ethnic Han and are accused of destroying the grasslands.
Last year, protests erupted over the deaths of two men who had been opposed to mining. Mr. Hu locked down the streets with security forces and met with some of the aggrieved residents.
At the party congress this month, Mr. Hu rebutted a reporter who asked him whether his policy stand was too soft.
''Practically speaking, things are handled the way they should be,'' he said, according to China News Service, an official agency. ''It's tough when it needs to be tough; it's soft when it needs to be soft.''
Mr. Sun served as agriculture minister before becoming party chief of Jilin Province in 2009.
He emphasizes his attachment to rural China. He has told reporters that in 2007, while visiting a party historical site in Jiangxi Province, he was given two i.o.u. notes that the Red Army had handed peasants in 1934 for food borrowed by soldiers.
''Ever since then, I've always kept them in my wallet,'' Mr. Sun told a reporter from Xinhua, the official news agency, in 2009. ''They constantly remind me that Chinese farmers have made enormous contributions to the Chinese Revolution and the building of a new China.''
Changing of the Guard: Articles in this series are examining the implications for China and the rest of the world of the changes in the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.

HEADLINE: Diabetes and Sweetener Link Scrutinized

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
A new study that found a higher prevalence of diabetes in countries with a high level of fructose corn syrup in their food supplies came under attack before it was even released Monday, highlighting the rising controversy over sweeteners and the role they play in the nation's health.
The study found that type 2 diabetes occurred 20 percent more often in countries where high-fructose corn syrup was in common use, compared with countries where it was rarely -- or never -- added to food. 
The study's authors reached their conclusion by evaluating existing statistics on body mass index, diabetes rates and global food consumption. But the correlation increased after adjustments were made for country level differences in body mass, population and gross domestic product.
''We're not saying that high-fructose corn syrup causes diabetes or that it is the only factor or even the only dietary factor with a relation to diabetes,'' said Dr. Michael I. Goran, a professor of preventive medicine at the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California and an author of the study. ''But it does support a growing body of evidence linking high-fructose corn syrup and diabetes.''
The study included 43 countries where the availability of high-fructose corn syrup ranged from zero kilos per capita, like in India and 13 other countries, to 24.78 kilos (54.6 pounds) per capita in the United States.
Food makers have increased their use of high-fructose corn syrup as an alternative to sugar in sodas, breakfast cereals and baked goods, and its use is expanding globally, although it still is hard to find in foods in many European countries and India.
The study, co-authored by Stanley J. Ulijaszek, director of the Unit of Biocultural Variation and Obesity at the Institute of Social and Cultural Anthropology at the University of Oxford, and Emily E. Ventura, a research associate at the Childhood Obesity Research Center at U.S.C., was scheduled for publication Tuesday in the journal Global Public Health. But a copy reached the Corn Refiners Association, the industry group representing the companies that produce high-fructose corn syrup, which on Monday fired off a rebuttal. ''This latest article by Dr. Goran is severely flawed, misleading and risks setting off unfounded alarm about a safe and proven food and beverage ingredient,'' Audrae Erickson, president of the association, said in a statement.
Marion Nestle, the author of ''Food Politics'' and a blog of the same name and a professor at New York University, also was critical of the study. ''I think it's a stretch to say the study shows high-fructose corn syrup has anything special to do with diabetes,'' Dr. Nestle said. ''Diabetes is a function of development. The more cars, more TVs, more cellphones, more sugar, more meat, more fat, more calories, more obesity, the more diabetes you have.''
She noted that the study ''falls right in the middle of the Corn Refiners fight with the Sugar Association,'' a reference to the legal war being waged between the two industry groups over the marketing of high-fructose corn syrup.
Dr. Goran said he was prepared for criticism of the study, because the Corn Refiners attacked previous research he did on high-fructose corn syrup in soda.
At a two-day workshop earlier this month on clinical research strategies for fructose metabolism hosted by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, Dr. Goran said representatives of industry groups and food companies participated along with the scientists. ''There was definitely some electricity in the air,'' Dr. Goran said.
''Scientists were around the tables, but industry people were in the galleries -- corn refiners, soda people, sugar people -- and they were able to make comments and ask questions. I got shouted down a few times, which made me uncomfortable.''

HEADLINE: Jefferson: Slaveholder Vs. Patriot

BYLINE: By JENNIFER SCHUESSLER

 BODY:
Henry Wiencek suspected he would be in for a rough ride when ''Master of the Mountain: Thomas Jefferson and His Slaves,'' his scathing assessment of America's third president, was published last month. But just how rough he may not have realized.
True, Mr. Wiencek, an independent scholar, has received the kind of attention most authors can only dream of: book excerpts on the covers of both Smithsonian and American History magazines, a C-Span interview at Monticello, almost universally glowing reviews from nonspecialists. (Jonathan Yardley of The Washington Post called the book ''brilliant,'' while Laura Miller of Salon hailed it as one ''every American should read.'') 
But the Jefferson scholars who have weighed in have subjected ''Master of the Mountain'' (published by Farrar, Straus & Giroux) to a fierce barrage of criticism, blasting away at Mr. Wiencek's evidence, interpretations and claims to originality. Reviewing the book in Slate, Annette Gordon-Reed, the author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning study ''The Hemingses of Monticello,'' declared that it ''fails as a work of scholarship,'' recklessly misreading documents and dismissing other scholars in pursuit of a ''journalistic obsession with 'the scoop.' '' Jan Ellen Lewis, a historian at Rutgers University, writing in The Daily Beast, was even blunter, denouncing the book as a ''train wreck,'' written by a man ''so blinded by his loathing of Thomas Jefferson that he can't see'' contrary evidence ''right in front of his eyes.''
The divergence of response would seem to highlight the difference between the ways professionals and lay readers approach history, not to mention the sometimes tense relations between academic historians and independent scholars working the same beat, especially one as charged and contentious as the relationship between the founding fathers and slavery.
Mr. Wiencek (pronounced WIN-seck), the author of a well-regarded earlier book about George Washington and slavery, certainly sees it that way.
''Inside the Jefferson bubble, they are trying to discredit this,'' he said recently in a telephone conversation from his home in Charlottesville, Va., a few miles down the road from Monticello. ''It presents an image they don't like.''
Mr. Wiencek's main contention is that sometime in the 1790s, Jefferson became so convinced of the economic value of slavery that he completely abandoned his youthful antislavery sentiments.
To bolster his argument, Mr. Wiencek points to a note in the margins of a 1792 report to George Washington that he believes shows Jefferson, then serving as secretary of state, calculating the birth of slave children as delivering a reliable return on capital of ''4 percent per annum'' -- a note, he claims, that no writer on Jefferson has ever mentioned.
In their reviews, Ms. Lewis and Ms. Gordon-Reed dismiss this ''4 percent theorem,'' as Mr. Wiencek calls it, as a speculative back-of-the-envelope calculation about slavery in Virginia as a whole, not evidence of any turning point in Jefferson's thinking about his own investments in human property at Monticello.
But Mr. Wiencek defends his interpretation of the document, doubling down on what he sees as a ''core truth'' behind Jefferson's lifelong equivocations about the evils of slavery.
''It was all about the money,'' he said. ''By the 1790s, he saw them as capital assets and was literally counting the babies.''
When it comes to his critics, Mr. Wiencek is equally direct: ''They have turned what could have been a reasoned debate into a mudslinging fest.''
But even some who are sympathetic to Mr. Wiencek's dark view of Jefferson say that if there is mud flying, Mr. Wiencek set it off by writing a sensationalistic book that repackages the work of scholars who have spent decades fighting for a full acknowledgment of Jefferson's entanglement with slavery, only to be painted now as apologists for the man.
''I think Thomas Jefferson is one of the most deeply creepy people in American history,'' said Paul Finkelman, a professor at Albany Law School and the author of ''Slavery and the Founders,'' which outlines the evasions of earlier generations of Jefferson scholars. ''But for Henry to come along and say, 'I am the first one to discover this'? Come on.''
Mr. Wiencek acknowledges some truth in the charge that he is repackaging the work of others, but defends his book as a real contribution.
''Yes, I'm repeating some of information that others have brought out,'' he said. ''But others brought it out and buried it in footnotes. I brought it all together. I connected the dots.''
Historians, however, tend to read footnotes first, and some have raised eyebrows at what they see in Mr. Wiencek's. In particular, they point to his treatment of the work of Ms. Gordon-Reed, whose 1997 book, ''Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings: An American Controversy,'' was instrumental in breaking down the wall of resistance to the idea that Jefferson had a sexual relationship with Hemings.
Ms. Gordon-Reed's name appears nowhere in the body of the text but three times in Mr. Wiencek's endnotes, twice to mention her ''erroneous and misleading'' transcriptions of key documents relating to Hemings.
David Waldstreicher, a historian at Temple University and the author of several books about slavery and the founders, called those footnotes (which do not identify the errors or acknowledge that Ms. Gordon-Reed corrected one of the transcriptions a decade ago in a reissue of her 1997 book) ''fighting words'' and ''about as nasty as it gets.'' A professional historian, he continued, ''would publish this in a scholarly journal and make it very clear how it makes a difference, instead of using it to say, 'I am the last word.' ''
Mr. Wiencek said in the interview that the transcription errors were minor. But his third reference to Ms. Gordon-Reed cuts to the heart of a larger continuing debate in the writing of academic history: How does one balance, or, now, rebalance, the shift from focusing on men of power, like Jefferson, to exploring the ways women, slaves and other marginalized people shaped their own destiny?
At the close of his book, Mr. Wiencek quotes a sentence from ''The Hemingses of Monticello'' as an example of the way two decades of scholarship that emphasizes the ''agency'' of slaves implies, as he puts it, that they ''had no master.''
Ms. Lewis, in an interview, called that passage a ''profound misreading'' of Ms. Gordon-Reed's work. ''There are historians who in their eagerness to discover the slave perspective have averted our attention from the ways in which slavery really was a horrible, unjust institution, but he doesn't cite them,'' she said. ''Instead, he cites Annette Gordon-Reed? You've got to be kidding me.''
Since his book was published, Mr. Wiencek has been more direct in his claims, asserting that his work ''systematically demolishes'' Ms. Gordon-Reed's portrayal of Jefferson as ''a kindly master to black slaves.''
But Ms. Gordon-Reed, for her part, scoffs at the idea, noting that her books discuss many of the same instances of cruelty at Monticello that Mr. Wiencek cites. ''That was Jefferson's image of himself, as a benevolent slaveholder,'' she said. ''My work shows that's impossible.''
Even some of the scholars who helped Mr. Wiencek have turned against him. In his acknowledgments Mr. Wiencek, who received a research fellowship from the International Center for Jefferson Studies, thanks Lucia Stanton, the recently retired chief historian at Monticello, whose decades of research on slavery at the plantation he credits with breaking ''the seals on many hidden histories.''
But in a letter last month to The Hook, a Charlottesville newspaper that ran an article about ''Master of the Mountain,'' Ms. Stanton blasted him for a ''breathtaking disrespect for the historical record and for the historians who preceded him,'' including Edwin M. Betts, whose 1953 edition of Jefferson's plantation records Mr. Wiencek claims deliberately left out a passage indicating that Jefferson knew that very young enslaved boys in the Monticello nail factory were being whipped.
''How can he know that Betts 'deliberately' suppressed this sentence, in what was a compilation of excerpts, not full letters?'' she asked, noting that Betts's edition contains many far worse details about Jefferson's treatment of slaves.
Mr. Waldstreicher said Mr. Wiencek had raised legitimate questions about the editing of Jefferson's farm records that scholars would need to untangle. But for the moment, Mr. Wiencek is not going to get the public forum with Ms. Gordon-Reed he says he is eager for. The museum at Poplar Forest, Jefferson's other plantation, in Lynchburg, Va., has invited both of them to appear on a panel. Ms. Gordon-Reed, however, has declined.

HEADLINE: A Tax Break Once Sacred Is Now Seen As Vulnerable

BYLINE: By PETER EAVIS

 BODY:
A tax break that has long been untouchable could soon be in for some serious scrutiny.
Many home buyers deduct their mortgage interest when assessing their tax bill, a perk that has helped bolster the income of millions of families - and the broader housing market.
But as President Obama and Congress try to hash out a deal to reduce the budget deficit, the mortgage interest deduction will likely be part of the discussion.
Limits on a broad array of deductions could emerge in any budget deal. It is likely that any caps would be structured to aim at high-income households, and would diminish or end the mortgage tax break for many of those taxpayers.
"This is definitely a chance worth jumping for," said Amir Sufi, a professor at the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago. "For a fixed amount of revenue, it's better to remove deductions than increase marginal tax rates." 
Such a move would be fiercely opposed by the real estate industry. The industry has played a crucial role in defending the tax break, even as other countries with high homeownership have phased it out.
Housing market players who oppose any whittling down of the mortgage deduction still have plenty of time to press their case before Congress makes a decision. If President Obama and Congress do manage to reach an agreement to avoid the looming tax raises and spending cuts, their deal will be broad in nature. Then, over the following months, Congress will hash out details, like any caps on deductions.
"Until Congress introduces specific legislation, there's nothing to say about any proposed changes to the mortgage interest deduction," Gary Thomas, president of the National Association of Realtors, said in an e-mailed statement. "However, it has always been the N.A.R.'s position that the mortgage interest deduction is vital to the stability of the American housing market and economy, and we will remain vigilant in opposing any future plan that modifies or excludes the deductibility of mortgage interest."
One of the reasons the mortgage tax break is so vulnerable is that both Democrats and Republicans have recently favored capping deductions, including both President Obama and the recent Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney.
What is more, deductions could be used to grease a compromise in the budget negotiations. High earners would be hit most by deduction limits, something that might make Republicans recoil. But the party may tolerate such a policy in return for a deal that limits how much actual tax rates go up for high-income households.
Taken on its own, the deduction limit wouldn't make a huge difference. But it can play an important role in a broad plan to cut the deficit, and shows a willingness to tackle once sacred cows. The tax numbers suggest it may not be hard to structure deduction limits in a way that leaves most middle-income households untouched.
With the mortgage interest deduction, households realized tax savings of $83 billion in 2010, according to figures from the Reason Foundation. The bulk of those savings are enjoyed by the higher earners.
There are a range of ways to increase tax revenue by aiming at higher earners, some less comprehensive than others. For instance, the interest deduction relating to second homes could be ended. Also, the cap on mortgage debt eligible for the interest rate deduction - currently $1 million - could be reduced.
There are broader approaches, too. In its proposed budget, the Obama administration plans to focus on top earners. The administration suggests capping deductions at 28 percent for high-income households, those earning more than $250,000.
Under the current rules, a high-earning household deducting $20,000 in interest payments would probably apply a 35 percent rate to that amount and receive $7,000 in tax savings. The Obama budget aims to limit that tax saving by capping that rate at 28 percent. If that rate were applied to $20,000 of interest payments, the saving would fall to $5,600.
The United States would capture the difference. Over the next 10 years, that 28 percent cap could increase tax revenue by $584 billion, according to the Treasury Department.
Separately, the Obama administration also wants to limit high earners' deductions by letting certain Bush-era exemptions expire. Altogether, the Treasury Department thinks it could raise $749 billion over 10 years by limiting deductions for higher earners. That's substantially more than the $684 billion it thinks it could raise from increasing their tax rates.
Still, there are situations where certain middle-income earners do get hit by deduction limits.
Consider a policy that uses a dollar limit, and caps all deductions at $35,000. That amount would be plenty to cover most middle-income households' mortgage interest, state and local taxes and charitable giving.
But people earning more than $100,000 may start to reach the limit, according to Sidney B. Rosenberg, associate professor emeritus at the University of North Florida. He assumes a household earns $110,000 and has a $300,000 mortgage on which it pays $17,500 a year. It also pays property taxes and state taxes at estimated nationally average rates. Such a family would have nearly $35,000 of deductible expenses, Dr. Rosenberg calculates.
One argument against curtailing the mortgage deduction is that it could reduce demand for housing, depressing home prices when the housing market is still somewhat weak. The National Association of Realtors believes a removal of the deduction could reduce property values by 15 percent, according to a presentation last year from its chief economist, Lawrence Yun.
Other analysts say they believe the housing industry overstates the potential impact. With several forms of government subsidy also supporting housing, it's hard to single out the effect of the mortgage deduction. At the most, the Reason Foundation estimates, the deduction may bolster house prices by 3 percent.
Since any deduction cap is likely to aim at higher earners, expensive houses would be most affected. But big-ticket homes appear much more resilient to shocks than lower-cost dwellings.
CoreLogic, a housing data company, tracks data that effectively divides the market into higher- and lower-cost houses, grouping them based on the size of the mortgages. The prices of the higher-cost houses are up 5.9 percent since the start of 2005, before the housing crash. In contrast, the houses at the lower end have fallen 13.5 percent in price since the beginning of 2005.
Given the apparent sturdiness of the higher end of the housing market, politicians may decide there are few risks in effectively capping mortgage deductions for high earners. Limiting tax breaks in a way that could reduce mortgage relief would be a change for Washington, which has done so much to support housing.
Nick Kasprak, an analyst at the Tax Foundation, said that up until recently he didn't expect to see a cap on deductions. "But now," he said, "it seems both parties are open to pursuing this strategy."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: A Study of Home Help Finds Low Worker Pay

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Nannies, caregivers and housecleaners earn a median wage of about $10 an hour, and few receive benefits like health insurance or paid sick days, according to the first-ever national statistical study of domestic workers, which is being released on Tuesday.
The study, based on interviews with 2,086 workers in 14 major metropolitan areas, found substantial differences in pay across ethnicity, immigration status and whether the worker lived with her employer. 
The report found that the median wage for nannies was $11 an hour, compared with a $10-an-hour median for caregivers and housecleaners. But 23 percent of the workers earned less than their state's minimum wage, which varies but must be at least the federal level of $7.25 an hour.
The study noted that white domestic workers generally earned more than their black, Hispanic and Asian counterparts, although the study said that African-American nannies earned slightly more -- a median of $12.71 an hour -- than white ones ($12.55 an hour). Hispanic nannies earned $8.57 an hour, while Asian ones earned $11.11.
Called ''Home Economics: The Invisible and Unregulated World of Domestic Work,'' the study was based on interviews with nannies, caregivers and housecleaners who now work in the United States but originally came from 71 countries. The interviews were conducted in nine languages: English, Spanish, Polish, Portuguese, Tagalog, Mandarin, Cantonese, Haitian Creole and Nepali.
The researchers found that domestic workers who were illegal immigrants earned considerably less than those who were American-born or naturalized citizens. Nannies who were citizens had a median pay of $12.50 an hour, while illegal immigrants earned $9.86 an hour. Caregivers who were American citizens received a median of $10.30 an hour; caregivers without legal work authorization earned $8.33.
''The upshot of the study is that domestic workers who help so many families with taking care of their loved ones and taking care of their homes often earn so little that they have a difficult time supporting their own families,'' said Nik Theodore, an author of the study and an associate professor of urban policy at the University of Illinois at Chicago.
Mr. Theodore said there are about 800,000 nannies, caregivers and housecleaners who work for households who pay them directly. The researchers did not study domestic workers employed through companies or outside agencies.
The study's other author was Linda Burnham, research director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance, an advocacy group. The study was financed by the Ford Foundation, the Open Society Foundations and the Alexander Soros Foundation.
The study noted that the American Community Survey, conducted by the Census Bureau, found that 95 percent of domestic workers were women, 46 percent were immigrants, 54 percent were nonwhite and 35 percent were noncitizens.
Live-in domestic workers were found to earn far less than ''live-outs.'' Live-in nannies earned a median wage of $6.76 an hour, the study said, while live-out nannies earned $11.55. Live-in caregivers earned $7.69 an hour, compared with $10 for live-out caregivers. According to the study, 67 percent of live-in domestic workers earn less than their state's minimum wage.
With many domestic workers called on to take care of infants or the elderly during the night, the study found that 25 percent of live-in workers said their responsibilities prevented them from getting at least five hours of uninterrupted sleep.
Most domestic workers do not receive fringe benefits from their employers, the study found. About 65 percent of domestic workers reported that they did not have health insurance of any kind, and just 4 percent said they received coverage through their employer. About 82 percent said they did not receive paid sick days, and only 9 percent said their employers paid into Social Security for them.
''The good thing about the job is you get to meet different people and form a bond with people,'' said Barbara Young, who worked as a nanny and caregiver for 17 years in New York and is now a full-time organizer with the National Domestic Workers Alliance. ''But the big problem was compensation. It's often very low salary and there are often no benefits.''
Ms. Young said she once asked her employer to take out money to contribute to Social Security for her. But at the end of the year, she recalled, the husband in the house returned that money, saying he had not bothered to pay it into Social Security.
The study found that white caregivers received a median wage of $12 an hour, Hispanic and African-American ones, $10 an hour, and Asian ones, $8.33 an hour. The study found that for white housecleaners, median pay was $12.50. For blacks, it was $10.80, and for Hispanics and Asians, it was $10.
A recurring theme in the report was that domestic workers were more isolated than those in most other jobs. ''Working behind closed doors, beyond the reach of personnel policies, and often without employment contracts, they are subject to the whims of their employers,'' the study said. ''Some employers are terrific, generous and understanding. Others, unfortunately, are demanding, exploitative and abusive.''
Domestic workers are covered neither by federal minimum wage laws nor by most states' minimum wage laws. Nor are they generally covered by unemployment insurance, or antidiscrimination or workers' compensation laws.
Ten percent of the domestic workers reported that at least once during the past 12 months they were paid less than agreed to or not at all. In addition, 29 percent of housecleaners said they had suffered from skin irritation over the past 12 months, while for caregivers, the same percentage reported suffering a back injury in the prior year.
The report made several recommendations, including ending the exclusion of domestic workers from state minimum wage laws, providing them with workers' compensation and unemployment insurance coverage and guaranteeing them overtime pay and meal and rest breaks.
Namrata Pradham, an immigrant from Nepal who works as a nanny in the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood of New York, said she enjoys the respect of being treated as a responsible professional. She earns $14 an hour, more than many domestic workers, and has been promised five paid sick days a year, if she needs them.
''I'm not scared about speaking up about my salary and my rights,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Values Slide From Top of Merkel's List

BYLINE: By JUDY DEMPSEY

 BODY:
BERLIN -- When Angela Merkel became chancellor in November 2005, she decided to focus on foreign policy. That was unusual. Most German leaders tend to concentrate on domestic issues during their first term in office.
Ms. Merkel moved quickly to rebalance German foreign policy by rebuilding Germany's relations with Washington and Warsaw. Her predecessor, the Social Democrat Gerhard Schrder, had concentrated on forging very close economic and business ties with Russia and China, at the expense of the trans-Atlantic relationship. Mr. Schrder's vocal opposition to the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq led to a chill between Washington and Berlin. His particularly close friendship with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia damaged German relations with Eastern Europe.
But Ms. Merkel did something else during her first term: She put values at the top of her agenda. 
Whether she was in Russia, China or the United States, she spoke openly about defending human rights and press freedom and against torture and the U.S. detention center at Guantnamo Bay, Cuba. She won praise from civil liberties organizations.
Seven years later, as Ms. Merkel plans her re-election bid, due in 10 months' time, analysts say she is putting interests before values. ''Except for her harsh criticism of Putin, Merkel is much milder about speaking out about human rights,'' said Hugh Williamson, director for Europe and Central Asia at Human Rights Watch. ''She is distracted by the euro crisis and its impact on the German economy. But does that mean she has to be mute over human rights?''
The euro crisis has affected German foreign policy in two ways.
First, Berlin is no longer making any effort to discuss the future of European security and military policy. ''It is not on the agenda. But whose agenda is it on?'' said Henrik Heidenkamp, a military expert at the Royal United Services Institute, a research group in London.
Astonishingly, said Graham Muir, head of policy and planning at the European Defense Agency, E.U. leaders have not discussed security and military issues for seven years. ''The last time was at Hampton Court during the U.K. presidency in 2005. Ever since, there has not been a substantive discussion at summit level,'' he added. The agency's role is to encourage member states to cooperate on military planning and share their capabilities instead of duplicating them.
But E.U. leaders' preoccupations with the global financial crisis and then the euro crisis are not the only reasons for their reluctance to discuss security and the military.
Any serious debate about the issue would mean having to agree about values and interests, and how to implement them, analysts say.
The first time the European Union attempted to set out a security strategy was in 2003. Despite some attempts to write a new one in 2007, Europe is still left without a security doctrine of any value. This is despite the extraordinary changes sweeping across the Middle East and Southeast Asia, and despite the Union being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize this year.
The second way in which the euro crisis has affected Ms. Merkel's foreign policy is her determination to protect German jobs. That means ensuring that German industry has access, for example, to rare earth metals that are essential components for the renewable energy sector and for electric cars.
China produces nearly 95 percent of the world's rare earth metals. Kazakhstan and Mongolia have sizable deposits, too. Over the past few years, Ms. Merkel has made big efforts to protect the German economy and its booming export sector by visiting or hosting the leaders of undemocratic and authoritarian countries.
Which Western leader wouldn't do the same, given the same kind of industrial base?
Ms. Merkel has raised human rights issues with all these countries, but her interventions lack the fervor of her first term. ''The economic and fiscal pressures are pushing aside values,'' Mr. Heidenkamp said. ''They have not vanished as such. Realpolitik has come into play.''
What this means is that until the next German elections, Ms. Merkel will tread a cautious foreign policy path, careful to protect jobs and exports.
''We can only hope that if she is re-elected, she will place values once again on top of her agenda,'' said Mr. Williamson of Human Rights Watch. ''It matters for Germany's reputation, especially given its global economic presence.''
It also matters for the European Union. It can do little without German support.

HEADLINE: Business Leaders Show Growing Split On Fiscal Priorities

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- At least a half-dozen deficit-minded chief executives will meet with Speaker John A. Boehner and the House Republican leadership on Wednesday, trying to raise the pressure on Republicans to include significant revenue increases in a quick deal to avert a fiscal crisis.
At the same time, the heads of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Business Roundtable met on Monday with the White House chief of staff, Jacob J. Lew, carrying a harder-line message on taxes to a skeptical audience. 
The round of meetings this week illustrates a growing split in the business community as negotiations to avert automatic tax increases and spending cuts in January heat up.
''No question about it,'' there is a split, said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the second-ranking Democrat, who expressed exasperation with the business groups still opposing any increase in taxes.
The group of chief executives in the deep-pocketed Fix the Debt Coalition says any deal to avert the so-called ''fiscal cliff'' will have to include significant revenue increases, changes to entitlement programs and a new round of spending cuts.
The Chamber of Commerce and Business Roundtable have called for all of the expiring Bush-era tax cuts to be extended before January. While both are pushing for an overhaul of the tax code next year, neither has endorsed raising revenues through extensive changes to it.
Jon Romano, a spokesman for Fix the Debt, described events on Capitol Hill on Wednesday as a major push. Chief executive officers, college students and activists from nine states will converge on Washington. Among them will be Erskine B. Bowles, the former Clinton White House chief of staff who was a co-chairman of President Obama's deficit reduction task force; Doug Oberhelman of Caterpillar Inc.; Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs; Thomas Wilson of Allstate; Mark Bertolini of Aetna; Gregg Sherrill of Tenneco; and David Cote of Honeywell, who also served on the deficit task force.
''People in both parties agree we need a 'balanced approach' to deal with our deficit and debt and help our economy create jobs,'' Mr. Boehner said in a statement announcing that he would attend the meeting. ''As we've seen in recent days, the American people support an approach that involves both major spending cuts and additional revenue via tax reform with lower tax rates.''
The group's association with Mr. Bowles has given it weight but has also aligned it with the politically freighted deficit reduction plan drafted by Mr. Bowles and former Senator Alan K. Simpson, a Republican and the other co-chairman of the president's deficit commission. That plan called for as much as $2 trillion in additional revenue over 10 years, along with significant changes to entitlements and more spending cuts.
Boehner aides chose to emphasize a separate proposal floated by Mr. Bowles alone, which appeared to take up the speaker's proposal to raise a more modest $800 billion over 10 years. It is not clear, however, whether that was Mr. Bowles's preferred option or whether he was merely saying that Mr. Boehner's numbers, along with spending cuts and health care changes, could lead to significant deficit reduction.
In the tussle between the two business coalitions, Fix the Debt may have the political upper hand. The Chamber of Commerce spent tens of millions of dollars in the 2012 election, especially against Democratic Senate candidates. In nearly all of the races it entered, its Republican candidate lost, and Democrats -- especially in the Senate -- are not going to be quick to forgive and forget, Mr. Durbin said. ''They lost their fannies,'' he said.
White House aides said Mr. Obama spoke over the weekend with Mr. Boehner and Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader. The president plans to meet with Congressional leaders again this week to resume negotiations, but no date has been announced.

HEADLINE: Efforts to Curb Social Spending Face Resistance

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama's re-election and Democratic gains in Congress were supposed to make it easier for the party to strike a deal with Republicans to resolve the year-end fiscal crisis by providing new leverage. But they could also make it harder as empowered Democrats, including some elected on liberal platforms, resist significant changes in entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare.
As Congress returned Monday, the debate over those programs, which many Democrats see as the core of the party's identity, was shaping up as the Democratic version of the higher-profile struggle among Republicans over taxes.
In failed deficit reduction talks last year, Mr. Obama signaled a willingness to consider substantial changes in the social safety net, including a gradual increase in the eligibility age for Medicare and limits in the growth rate of future Social Security benefits. An urgent question hanging over the new round of deficit talks is which of those changes Mr. Obama and Congressional Democrats would accept today. 
While a potential change in calculating Social Security increases was part of the talks with Speaker John A. Boehner last year, the White House press secretary, Jay Carney, made clear on Monday that the administration was not considering changes to the retirement program as part of the deficit talks.
''We should address the drivers of the deficit, and Social Security is not currently a driver of the deficit,'' Mr. Carney said.
Republicans insist that changes in the major entitlement programs be on the table in exchange for their willingness to accept increases in tax revenue. But Democrats have given no indication that they are willing to consider policy changes or savings of the magnitude demanded by Republicans. The underlying dispute highlights a reason the politics of the deficit are so thorny: even as many voters say they want Washington to reduce the budget deficit, they oppose many of the benefit cuts and tax increases that could help achieve that goal.
As the negotiations enter a crucial phase, influential outside advocacy groups like AARP and the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare are weighing in, alerting their members to possible changes in the popular programs.
In the current negotiations with Congress over deficits and the debt, Mr. Obama said he would take a serious look at how to ''reform our entitlements'' because ''health care costs continue to be the biggest driver of our deficits.'' Unless Mr. Obama and Congress reach some agreement, tax increases and budget reductions will take effect automatically on Jan. 1.
Mr. Obama's room for maneuvering is limited by several political factors. In the presidential campaign, for example, he attacked cost-cutting proposals by his Republican opponents and won support from millions of voters by promising to defend Medicare.
Moreover, since the Supreme Court upheld the new health care law in June, Mr. Obama has become skittish about cutbacks in Medicaid, the federal-state program for low-income people. The court said the expansion of Medicaid was an option for states but not a requirement. Cutting federal Medicaid payments to states could reduce the federal budget deficit, but could also cripple Mr. Obama's efforts to persuade governors to expand the program, the foundation of his health care overhaul.
Even if Mr. Obama and Republican leaders in Congress could agree on savings in Medicare and Medicaid, the president would face resistance from some liberal members of his party who oppose cuts in the two giant health care entitlement programs. Medicare and Medicaid insure one-third of all Americans, account for more than one-fifth of the federal budget and are expected to grow much faster than the economy in the coming decade.
Two staunch liberals, Senators Tom Harkin of Iowa and John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia, said in a letter to Mr. Obama that he should ''reject changes to Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security that would cut benefits, shift costs to states, alter the structure of these critical programs, or force vulnerable populations to bear the burden of deficit reduction.''
More than 40 House members, led by the Congressional Progressive Caucus, declare in a resolution that any deal on taxes and spending ''should not cut Medicare, Medicaid or Social Security benefits.''
Republicans say the revenue to be gained from Mr. Obama's tax proposals would be dwarfed by the growing costs of the benefit programs.
''You can't raise taxes enough to solve the problem,'' said the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. ''Additional revenue should be tied to the only thing that will save the country in the long run, and that is reforming entitlements.''
Mr. Boehner said the newest entitlement -- insurance subsidies for more than 20 million people under the health care law -- should be ''on the table'' in negotiations. White House officials said the law should be given a chance to work before its budget is cut.
In talks with Congressional leaders, Mr. Obama is seeking $1.6 trillion in additional revenue over 10 years and $340 billion in health care savings. If he hopes to get a deal, lawmakers say, the additional revenue will have to come down and the health care savings may have to go up.
Mr. Obama and some Democrats in Congress say they are willing to squeeze savings from Medicare by trimming payments to drug companies, hospitals and other health care providers. They have generally ruled out structural changes that would increase costs for a typical beneficiary.
In the presidential campaign, Mitt Romney said Medicare should provide ''less support'' to wealthier beneficiaries, and that is an idea on which Mr. Obama and Congressional Republicans could perhaps agree.
Individuals with incomes over $85,000 a year ($170,000 for couples) already pay higher premiums for Medicare coverage of doctors' services. For beneficiaries with incomes over $214,000 ($428,000 for couples), the monthly premium is more than $300 per person, about three times the standard premium.
Mr. Obama wants to increase premiums for high-income people and increase the number of beneficiaries who must pay higher premiums based on income.
Congress should ''reduce the federal subsidy of Medicare costs for those beneficiaries who can most afford it,'' the president said this year. House Republicans voted for a similar proposal last year.
Max Richtman, the president of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, which represents beneficiaries, said this idea had been ''pushed as far as it should be pushed.'' Saddled with more and more costs, he said, high-income beneficiaries may eventually want to leave the program.
''If Medicare turns from an earned benefit into a welfare program,'' Mr. Richtman said, ''you will see support dissipate.''
Mr. Obama also wants to impose a surcharge on Medicare premiums for older Americans who buy the most generous private insurance to supplement Medicare. The White House and some economists say such Medigap insurance encourages the overuse of medical care because beneficiaries are shielded from most co-payments and other costs. But many beneficiaries are willing to pay for the extra protection, and major insurers derive substantial revenue from the product.
The politics of Medicaid are different.
As part of a deficit reduction plan unveiled in April 2011, when he delivered an address on fiscal policy at George Washington University, Mr. Obama proposed ''Medicaid savings of at least $100 billion over 10 years.''
Liberal Democrats and health care providers expressed dismay, saying the changes would hurt children, older Americans, poor people and those with disabilities. Mr. Obama scaled back the proposals. In his budget in February, he proposed legislative changes that would save Medicaid $55 billion over 10 years, mainly by reducing federal payments to states.
In the wake of the Supreme Court decision, Mr. Obama is coming under pressure from his allies to drop these proposals.

HEADLINE: Obama's New Cabinet

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
Elisse B. Walter?
Is that really whom President Obama named on Monday to be the new chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission? A woman who has been at the S.E.C. for the last four years? And, to boot, someone practically joined at the hip with her predecessor, Mary Schapiro? Say it ain't so, Mr. President.
No doubt, Commissioner Walter is a fine public servant. What she is not, however, is a fresh face with new ideas. And isn't that half the point of second-term appointments? They give a president a chance to name cabinet or agency directors who can breathe new life into their departments. Second-term appointments are presidential do-overs. 
Take, for instance, Timothy Geithner, the soon-to-be-departing Treasury secretary. All things considered, Geithner wasn't a bad secretary. In no small part because of him, America's banks are far better capitalized -- and hence safer -- than their European counterparts. But you always had the sense that his heart lay more with the bankers he was overseeing than the homeowners who needed help.
That is why our nominee to replace Geithner is his bte noire, Sheila Bair. As the chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, a job she held until July 2011, she fought against bank bailouts while pushing for mortgage modifications. Her new book, ''Bull By the Horns,'' is mostly her inside account of the financial crisis. But she also offers a series of sensible policy suggestions. Wouldn't you like a Treasury secretary who believes that interest on debt should not be tax deductible -- whether for large financial institutions or home mortgages? I sure would.
Let's move next to the State Department, where an exhausted Hillary Clinton is ready to step down. She has been, without question, Obama's finest appointment. She was also his riskiest. The current favorite for the job, Susan Rice, the United Nations ambassador, is a safe choice, but she doesn't have the breadth that the job requires. Who does? How about Bill Clinton? Seriously.
The president's worst cabinet appointment, on the other hand, has been Eric Holder Jr. at the Department of Justice. Under him, the department got prosecutorial scalps by going after the small fry while letting big guys like Angelo Mozilo, the former chief executive of Countrywide, off the hook. Holder has also been tone-deaf in dealing with the Republicans in Congress. Our nominee is a man with a reputation for cleaning up messes: Ken Feinberg, a lawyer who now specializes in victim compensation programs. A former special counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee, he knows the territory. A master negotiator, he knows how to bridge divides. And his sense of fair play is exactly what this Justice Department most needs.
Department of Defense? David Petraeus. After disclosing an affair with Paula Broadwell and resigning as C.I.A. chief, Petraeus is currently doing his stint in purgatory. The Defense Department in Obama's second term is going to need someone who can cut its budget without hurting its mission -- and who can reform the most entrenched bureaucracy in Washington. The military brass will run bureaucratic circles around any defense secretary who doesn't know their tricks. Petraeus can stand up to them.
The current secretary of energy, Steven Chu, is a scientist. A far better choice is a committed environmentalist who also understands the importance of making intelligent energy choices. We know just such a man: Fred Krupp of the Environmental Defense Fund. Unlike most environmental groups, the defense fund supports using hydraulic fracturing -- fracking -- to drill for natural gas. He is on record as saying that there are enormous climate benefits to using natural gas -- so long as methane leakage can be minimized. At the Energy Department, Krupp would be in a position to help make sure that happens.
With rumors that Arne Duncan may step down as secretary of Education, we nominate Randi Weingarten to replace him. Risky? You bet. But as the president of the American Federation of Teachers, Weingarten has long claimed to support education reform, so long as it is done with the nation's teachers instead of at their expense. Making Weingarten the next education secretary would give her the chance to put her money where her mouth is.
Which brings us back to the S.E.C. In The Times's account of Walter's promotion, it said that the White House might well offer up a new nominee in the future. We know the right man for the job: Sean Berkowitz. Berkowitz, who, in full disclosure, is a friend, led the Enron task force and prosecuted Enron's top two executives, Jeffrey Skilling and Kenneth Lay. So he knows how to nail the bad guys, which has been a problem for the current S.E.C.
Since 2006, he has been at Latham & Watkins, one of the nation's largest law firms, where he is now the global head of litigation. Oh, and one other thing, Mr. President.
He's from Chicago.

HEADLINE: The Happiness Project

BYLINE: ALIX BROWNE


HIGHLIGHT: For one L.A. couple, the good life is about luck, love and a lot of elbow grease. 

 BODY:
There are people who live charmed lives, and then there are Ian Barry and Amaryllis Knight. Barry grew up in Santa Cruz, Calif., and studied architecture at junior college. He plays guitar in the experimental band Black Math Horseman, and, each year for the past four years, he has built a single motorcycle, almost entirely from scratch. Knight grew up on the edge of Hampstead Heath, in London. (Her father, Andrew Knight, ran The Economist and then the London Daily Telegraph Group; her mother, Sabiha Rumani Malik, is a former director of the architecture firm Foster and Partners.) She has worked in refugee camps in Africa, lived for four months in a Tibetan colony in the Himalayan foothills and driven in a five-week road rally from London to Mongolia. She was a producer on a forthcoming documentary about the Source Family, the obscure early- 1970s mystical cult led by Father Yod. She also designs furniture and is a trained doula and apprentice midwife. 
Together they have created a way of life and channeled it into an enviable number of businesses and projects. They are partners in Bco Mercat, Josef Centeno's bustling downtown Los Angeles foodie outpost, resoundingly acclaimed as one of the 10 best new restaurants of 2012, and are also partners in his soon-to-open Tex-Mex restaurant and tequila joint, Bar Am. ("Ian is a nerd when it comes to rare mescal and tequila, so he's extra-excited about this one," Knight says.) Both are exacting and enthusiastic cooks - self-described control freaks in the kitchen who do not share knives. 
The couple, who have been engaged for five years, live in Laurel Canyon, in a house designed by Edward Fickett, an architectural adviser to President Dwight Eisenhower whose work includes Edwards Air Force Base, Dodger Stadium and the design of some 60,000 affordable and largely talk prefab dwellings known as Fickett Houses. Barry and Knight had little more than a mattress when they moved in early this year, but the house had great bones. They stripped out cascades of ivy and forlorn Italian Cyprus trees, built patios and raised gardens for vegetables. Knight designed a massive, architectural stairway to terrace a corner of the hillside where they planted Alphonso mango, four varieties of banana, pineapple-guava, pomegranate, lime-caviar, rose-apple, Jamaican allspice, cardamom and more. Once it all takes root, she says, "the foliage between the stairs can take a fair amount of abuse from traffic, and will release its scents with each tread: thyme, Corsican mint and chamomile." They enclosed an area of the guest bathroom, where once stood a eyesore of a shed, and put in a hummingbird garden, home, they hope, to Harold, a tiny refugee who was dislocated from his nest by the intensive landscaping. Three magnificent beasts, Taaka, Shiso and Arrow, all rescues and all varying degrees of wolf, roam the grounds - and an adjacent nine-acre citrus grove - freely, not fully able to believe their good fortune.
Barry sums it up this way: "Amaryllis is the spirit of everything." 
The path that brought them to this incredible place was not lined with birds of paradise and fragrant herbs. The two met over the Internet, over a motorcycle. Barry had recently quit a lucrative job as a network engineer for Veritas Software Corporation, and was living in a tent in a friend's yard in Los Angeles while pursuing his lifelong passion of building bikes. Knight, who had wanted a motorcycle since she had ridden behind her father on the back of one in Greece at the age of 5, was also chasing a childhood dream. 
"I fell in love with a black and oxblood custom pre-unit he had built for his friend Josh," Knight says, "so I wrote him and asked if he needed an assistant." Her offer was not as random as it may sound. Knight had once rebuilt a 1967 Mustang Fastback. Barry declined, but the two struck up a correspondence. One month and one day after they met face to face, he asked her to marry him, offering up half of everything he had, including Taaka. 
The immediate result of that union was Falcon, a company founded on the premise that Barry would build 10 bikes in 10 years, each based on a different engine type. And by build they did not mean assemble, but create, from scratch, every part with the exception of, say, the tires and the carburetor. They set up shop - and house - first in Echo Park, where their studio had no natural light and Knight was diagnosed with a vitamin D deficiency (her doctor asked her if she lived in a cave), and then in a 5,000-square-foot former factory in a gritty part of downtown Los Angeles next to Skid Row. Within the confines of a 14-foot corrugated metal fence, they created an oasis, but their front door was strewn with human feces and used needles almost daily. 
It was around that time that they met Centeno, then the chef at the Lazy Ox Canteen in nearby Little Tokyo. "We ate there all the time," says Knight, who was also thrilled whenever she happened to run into Centeno at the bank. "I was like, 'Yay, he can walk me to my car and I won't get mugged.' " The first official Falcon, designed around the engine of a 1950 Triumph Thunderbird and known as the Bullet, had already rolled into existence - and won the Custom Culture Award at the 2008 Legend of the Motorcycle International Concours d'Elegance in Pebble Beach. For Barry it was not so much a validation as a revelation: there were people out there who valued his work as much as he did. A photo on the couple's refrigerator shows Colin Powell dropping by the studio for a visit. 
TODAY, FALCON IS LOCATED ON a block of West Third Street, near La Brea, that will likely never be trendy but is not unreasonably far from parts of Hollywood that already are. Barry's studio is in the back of the building. And once he gets his collection of motorcycles out of there, the front will become Altai, a design consultancy and store scheduled to open early next year. Knight will spearhead an interiors and landscaping program and curate a selection of furniture and objects. She hired Teena Sahebi, a veteran of Opening Ceremony, to be the fashion director for men's clothing and run the style side of the business. "In the motorcycle world are the most badly dressed men you will ever meet," Knight says. (Altai has already secured exclusives from the likes of Raf Simons, Casely-Hayford and Christophe LeMaire for Herms.) But you also get the sense that being around Barry has spurred her own urge not just to nurture the creative impulse in everyone around her, but to get down to actually making things herself. "Ian has amassed an arsenal of tools - a five-axis CNC machine, metal benders, grinders, leveling tables and jigs," she says. "It offers us opportunities to experiment and build Altai furniture prototypes." So far these include a handsome polished aluminum and marble coffee table and a dog bed (both of which Knight designed for the Laurel Canyon house but that can be customized to fit someone else's) and a bronze fireplace screen that was a commission for a friend. She plans to "hire" Barry, who just completed Falcon No. 4, the White Falcon, last month; the two are also competing with one another on the design for a chair. "Ian challenged me to make a chair that looks like poured liquid metal," she says, pointing to the creative quid pro quo that fuels their romance. "The things I want to make, like the table, are so simple. Unlike Ian, I'm not trying to reinvent the wheel."

HEADLINE: In Court Battle, a Game of Brinkmanship With Argentina

BYLINE: STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF


HIGHLIGHT: A federal court says Argentina must set aside $1.33 billion for its American creditors, a decision that is threatening to throw the South American country and the entire sovereign debt market into turmoil. 

 BODY:
Foreclose on a country?
It sounds far-fetched, but a United States court is saying that Argentina must set aside $1.33 billion for some American hedge funds and others. That decision is threatening to throw the South American country and the entire sovereign debt market into turmoil.
This game of chicken is a lesson on the hazards of United States courts' interfering in international affairs.
 The origins of the mess arise from Argentina's status as a sometime deadbeat debtor. In 2001, the country defaulted on more than $80 billion worth of sovereign bonds. Historically, a default like this leaves bondholders with few options. There is no global bankruptcy process and individuals can't force a country to pay. A century or so ago, creditor countries would sometimes send in gunboats and troops to force payment.
These days, the lawyers and bankers are sent in, as a default usually leads to a restructuring of the country's debt. Typically, the creditors are forced to take a haircut while the country pays something to try to maintain access to the global credit markets. 
This is what happened in Argentina. In 2005 and 2010, Argentina restructured its debt offering to exchange the old bonds for new bonds at the paltry sum of 25 to 29 cents on the dollar. Argentina was able to push bondholders to accept such a low price because the offer was coupled with a new law passed by its Legislature making it illegal for the country to pay the old bonds. In other words, it was either the new bonds or nothing.
But there were holdouts, including thousands of Italian pensioners, who own what is now about $11 billion in debt.
The holdouts also included a number of hedge funds, some of which had acquired this debt as far back as the 1990s, seeing an opportunity for a big return, despite the risk. The group also includes Elliott Management and Aurelius Capital Management.
Elliott, a $20 billion hedge fund founded by Paul Singer, is one of the leaders in this field. It previously made outsize returns investing in defaulted sovereign debt and trying to force the country to pay by seizing its assets. For about $2 million, for example, Elliott bought sovereign debt with a face value of more than $30 million that was issued by the Republic of Congo. The fund was able to win a $100 million judgment in England and intercept $39 million worth of oil owned by the Republic of Congo. In the case of Argentina, Elliott recently was able to get a Ghanaian court to order the seizure of an Argentine frigate.
While the standoff over the frigate is embarrassing for Argentina, it is a sideshow to the litigation by Elliott and Aurelius in New York
A few years ago, Elliott and Aurelius changed their legal tack. They argued in court that the pari passu clause in the bond documents - common language in such documents that says that the investors cannot be treated differently - required that if Argentina paid any money on its new bonds it also had to pay the old defaulted holders. "Pari passu" is a Latin phrase that roughly means "on equal footing." It is intended to ensure that if a debtor issues new debt, it cannot be superior to the old debt.
Argentina showed up in Federal Distric Court for the Southern District of New York and through its lawyers heatedly argued that these clauses merely required Argentina to treat bondholders legally the same, not make equal payments, as the funds argued.
It's an arcane legal argument, and most legal scholars and those in the market sided with Argentina, stating that this was how debt restructuring had worked for decades.
But in October, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit disrupted this precedent, siding with the hedge funds. The court held that the pari passu clause required Argentina to pay the hedge funds on the old debt any time it made a payment on the new debt.
Argentina has a $3 billion payment on its new bonds due on Dec. 15. Last week, Judge Thomas P. Griesa of Federal District Court piggybacked on the Court of Appeals decision, ordering that if Argentina made this payment, it and any third parties through which this money was transferred would also have to set aside $1.33 billion, the entire amount owed to the hedge funds, to pay the old debt equally.
It's now chaos. Many believe that Argentina will simply default on all of its debt, refusing to pay the new debt to avoid paying the hedge funds - which have been deemed "vultures" by the country's politicians.
Hernn Lorenzino, Argentina's economy minister, reacted angrily to the court decisions, saying that they were "a kind of legal colonialism" and that all "we need now is for Griesa to send us the Fifth Fleet."
The uncertainty has affected Argentina's capital markets. Its stock market fell on the news, and credit-default swaps on Argentine debt have skyrocketed in price as the markets worry about yet another Argentine default.
Elliott and Aurelius are no doubt giddy. The current bondholders are wondering how they got dragged into this dispute.
This decision will also have real effects on global finance. Most bonds issued by sovereigns contain pari passu clauses, and this type of exchange was par for the course for country debt restructuring. (Just think of Greece.) And while bonds have changed in recent years to accommodate workouts and may be under the laws of different countries, it is still unclear whether these circumstances will affect the Court of Appeals ruling, as Anna Gelpern, a noted scholar in this area, has written. The ability of a country to achieve a workout and avoid this type of guerrilla action just got harder and more uncertain at a time of debt restructuring in Europe.
This is not supposed to happen.
The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976, which exempts sovereign nations from litigation, was enacted to avoid this. It prevents United States courts from attaching the property of foreign countries, a reason you don't see American creditors seizing Argentine frigates in New York harbor. But in the suit by Elliott and Aurelius, the courts sidestepped this act by ruling that their decision reflected how Argentina should act, without requiring it to pay. If Argentina decides not to pay the new debt, it does not have to pay the old debt. Still, the spirit of the act seems violated. And it is bad news when United States judges are seen as controlling the destinies of foreign countries.
Argentina is no angel. It is deliberately avoiding repaying these bondholders, and it used its sovereign immunity to force a disadvantageous situation. And the country is busy nationalizing other assets, including the energy company YPF, signaling increasingly that it is a bad global citizen.
But the Federal District Court overseeing this case through a decade of tiring litigation seems more focused on cramped legal interpretations and the morality of debt than on the wider consequences of its rulings. The judge in the matter even called Argentina's actions "immoral" - whatever that means to hedge funds and to other investors in a world of finance where only numbers matter.
And the federal courts willfully entered into this quicksand, overturning decades of custom and practice in these deals. For a few federal judges to take such an extreme step and upset the entire debt market, not just Argentina's capital markets, seems a bit risky.
The next move belongs to Argentina, which is entering another court appeal. But whatever happens on appeal, it is unlikely that the country will pay the hedge funds anytime soon, meaning that this battle between the federal courts and the country is likely to intensify. What a mess.

HEADLINE: Bob Corker and the Romney Road Not Taken


HIGHLIGHT: How a Republican Senator's proposed grand bargain differs from Romney's agenda, and why it matters. 

 BODY:
Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, has earned a round of media attention this week for sketching out a potential tax reform/entitlement reform compromise in the Washington Post. Here's the meat of his proposed grand bargain:
The proposal includes pro-growth federal tax reform, which generates more static revenue - mostly from very high-income Americans - by capping federal deductions at $50,000 without raising tax rates. It mandates common-sense reforms to the federal workforce, which will help bring its compensation in line with private-sector benefits, and implements a chained consumer price index across the government, a more accurate indicator of inflation. It also includes comprehensive Medicare reform that keeps in place fee-for-service Medicare without capping growth, competing side by side with private options that seniors can choose instead if they wish. Coupled with gradual age increases within Medicare and Social Security; the introduction of means testing; increasing premiums ever so slightly for those making more than $50,000 a year in retirement; and ending a massive "bed tax" gimmick the states use in Medicaid to bilk the federal government of billions, this reform would put our country on firmer financial footing and begin to vanquish our long-term deficit. 
I've seen a few people describe this as basically Mitt Romney's taxes-and-entitlements plan, now "made flesh and dwelling among us," as National Review's Dan Foster puts it. But that isn't quite right, because of course the Romney agenda included an expensive across-the-board rate cut as well, which in turn became the basis for the Obama White House's sly and effective insistence that Romney would have to ultimately raise taxes on the middle class, via deduction caps and the like, to make his math add up.
I think it's clear enough that Romney didn't want that implausible rate cut. He was pressured into it during the primary season, downplayed it during his autumn push, and it probably would have been the first thing to be discarded during negotiations with a Democratic Senate had he been elected. But it was there nonetheless.
Should Romney have run on the Corker plan instead? Well, no: Corker's sketch is a sensible negotiating position for Republicans to take in the context of Obama's victory, because it acknowledges the obvious (taxes are going to go up, somehow, on the wealthy) and then tries to shift the onus from the Congressional G.O.P. to the president, by saying "look, we've moved on taxes, so now it's your turn to move on entitlements." (And yes, I know, Corker doesn't speak for House Republicans, so this isn't actually the party's negotiating position at the moment.) But in the context of a presidential campaign, there was no reason for Romney to pre-emptively promise a tax increase when he could have wooed voters by promising to return the trillion dollars or so in savings from tax reform to the middle class instead - whether via the extension of the payroll tax cut discussed in my Sunday column, a larger child tax credit, the middle class capital gains tax cut that Romney's original policy blueprint emphasized, or some combination thereof.
In the presidential debates, that's basically what Romney did promise, telling audiences that the rich wouldn't save under his plan and the middle class would benefit. But that promise was difficult to square with the scope of the rate cut that he proposing, and he frequently ended up bogged down in unproductive arguments about the details of his proposal, in which he had to defend himself from the charge that he was just out to make life easier for the ultra-rich. I don't think the tax debate cost Romney the election. But it was a place where he could have helped himself politically by having a more thought-through, middle-class-friendly agenda, instead of the jury-rigged supply-side proposal that he ended up trying to defend instead.
Sound policy and sound politics are not always natural bedfellows, but they go together more often than strategists and consultants tend to think. This is the lesson of the Corker variation on the Romney plan: It's a sound negotiating position for the current political moment because it's a sound and credible policy proposal, and if Romney's somewhat similar proposals had shared that basic soundness, they might have done more for his ill-fated presidential campaign.

HEADLINE: Despite Fiscal Shadow, Consumer Confidence Rises

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: The more buoyant feeling, particularly strong among those over 55, is focused on expectations for the economy, rather than current conditions. 

 BODY:
Despite stagnant incomes and the threat of fiscal contraction scheduled for the end of the year, consumer confidence rose again in November, reaching its highest level since February 2008.
Consumer confidence has been rising for the last three months, and the latest pickup was driven by more buoyant expectations for the economy, as opposed to consumers' assessment of current conditions. In fact, for the last four years, consumers have been consistently more positive about the future of the economy than its present, which is the reverse of their attitudes for most of the expansion that preceded the financial crisis. 
Consumers over 55 have shown an especially sharp gain in confidence in the last few months, although consumers of all ages are still less positive about the economy than they were before the recession began. 
It's not clear why confidence is picking up in the face of scheduled tax increases and sharp cuts to federal spending, which could choke off all sorts of other economic activity. Perhaps Americans have faith that Congress will reach an agreement and avert a sharp fiscal tightening.
A firming job market and stronger home prices may also be encouraging more optimism about the economy.
As the Case-Shiller house price index showed Tuesday morning, prices have been rising on a year-over-year basis for four straight months. The gains are broad-based, too. Of the 20 cities whose housing prices are tracked each month, only two, Chicago and New York, fell on a year-over-year basis.
Businesses have appeared more shaken by the threat of the so-called "fiscal cliff."
October orders for durable goods, also reported Tuesday, came in essentially flat. Declines in the transportation sector -- motor vehicles, civilian aircraft and defense aircraft orders all fell -- wiped out modest gains in other sectors. Shipments of manufactured durable goods fell in October.
Orders of capital goods excluding defense and aircraft (so-called "core" capital goods) rose by 1.7 percent, which was a relief after a slide this summer but still relatively anemic.
In addition to the threat of fiscal contraction, "downgraded earnings projections due in part to weaker overseas growth and recession in Europe offer businesses little incentive to expand capacity," Paul Edelstein, the director of financial economics at IHS Global Insight, wrote in a note to clients.

HEADLINE: Student Loan Debt Rising, and Often Not Being Paid Back

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Americans have been getting better at paying off their debt in the last year, with a glaring exception: student loans. 

 BODY:
Americans have been getting better at paying off their debt in the last year, with a glaring exception: student loans.
Total consumer debt fell again in the third quarter, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit. This figure has been falling for four years. As consumer debt has been falling, so have consumers' delinquency rates. As of Sept. 30, 8.9 percent of outstanding household debt was in some stage of delinquency, with 6.6 percent at least 90 days late. 
Bucking this trend is student loans. Student loan debt has been growing every quarter since at least 2003, the earliest data included in the report. And delinquency rates look worse than previously believed.
Outstanding student loan balances totaled $956 billion as of the end of September, rising $42 billion from the previous quarter. About half of that increase is actually newly issued debt, and the other half comes from defaulted student loans that have been newly updated on credit reports this quarter. 
The New York Fed calculates that 11 percent of student loans are now at least 90 days delinquent, with this rate now officially passing the "serious delinquency" rate for credit card debt for the first time. 
That milestone may be misleading, though. The report says in a footnote that "these delinquency rates for student loans are likely to understate actual delinquency rates because almost half of these loans are currently in deferment or in grace periods and therefore temporarily not in the repayment cycle," adding, "This implies that among loans in the repayment cycle delinquency rates are roughly twice as high."
It's worth mentioning, by the way, that student loan debt cannot be discharged in bankruptcy, while most other forms of debt can. One reason consumers have managed to shed so much debt is that lenders ended up writing off quite a bit after the financial crisis.

HEADLINE: Boris Johnson Woos Delhi

BYLINE: SRUTHI GOTTIPATI


HIGHLIGHT: The mayor of London invites Indian talent to the United Kingdom. 

 BODY:
You know Mayor Boris Johnson of London really wants to win over the crowds here when he compliments India on its air quality.
"It's much better," said Mr. Johnson, who first visited India in 1996.
That's not a popular view. But it wasn't just praise that scored Mr. Johnson points on his visit to India this week. Sense of humor intact, Mr. Johnson was the beaming cherubic face of Britain as it tries to increase trade and investment between the two countries. 
Britain's recent decision to stop giving $450 million a year in development aid to India by 2015 signaled a meteoric shift in the former colonial power's relationship with New Delhi. Instead of aid, trade is the new mantra, and with Mr. Johnson's visit, Britain appears to be losing no time. 
"I believe the scope for partnership is limitless," he declared at a news conference Tuesday morning.
Mr. Johnson is the latest foreign dignitary, among many high-profile representatives, to woo India. The news conference Tuesday came on the heels of India and China signing seven economic cooperation agreements worth $5.2 billion. And the U.S. Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, visited India just last month.
Mr. Johnson acknowledged that Britain needed to edge out the United States, which has a firmer grip on the Indian market, in a piece he wrote for The Telegraph:
"We need to act fast, because we have ground to make up, and we cannot take anything for granted. Young Indians these days are like any other global population that finds itself in the throes of embourgeoisement: they are gripped and excited by America and American brands - Google, Coke, Nike, Starbucks, you name it. The biggest foreign food supplier in India is Domino's Pizza, an American firm."
Business leaders at the news conference told India Ink that India is closer to Britain because of history and colonial legacy but that the United States has been, at least until now, a preferred business destination.
Krishnan Chatterjee, vice president of HCL Technologies, said at the news conference that his company did 57 percent of its business in the United States, and a mere 20 percent in Britain.
"But our company's heart is in the U.K.," he said.
Later, Mr. Chatterjee told India Ink that the United States remained popular because of strong demand from single clients in cities for their services, and solid support from local governments there. As a result, he said, his company expected to add 10,000 jobs by 2015, mostly in the United States.
Ankur Bhatia, executive director of Bird Group, a company whose business interests include travel technology, aviation services and hospitality, said the size of the countries was responsible for their trade difference with India.
But he argued that India was still closer to Britain than the United States because of traditional cultural ties and the relatively shorter distance and closer time zones.
"This is the city at the center of the world," Mr. Bhatia said of London.
Mr. Johnson acknowledged that a few decades ago young Indians would scout for a university education in Britain, while today the country faces stiff competition from the United States. Still, he touted the benefits of the former colonial power.
"You're far more likely to get a visa in the U.K. than the U.S.," he said at the news conference, noting that his country would welcome talented people who want to contribute to its economy.
He also argued that London had more to offer than New York, saying it has twice as many bookshops as New York (with the correct spellings, he added cheekily) and a quarter of its murder rate.
"We've exported Piers Morgan to America," he chortled.
Mr. Johnson said there were 73 Indian companies on the London stock exchange, adding "it's the innovation capital of the world." He even claimed that Britain exports rice to India, but dubbed that "one of the facts too good to check."
Mr. Johnson also spoke of the sculpture in London's Olympic Park as emblematic of Indian and British partnership. The steel structure, called the ArcelorMittal Orbit, was designed by the Mumbai-born sculptor Anish Kapoor and 19.6 million, or $31 million, of the 22.7 million cost was funded by the steel magnate Lakshmi Niwas Mittal. The rest was paid for by the administrative body run by Mr. Johnson.
Like many others, Mr. Johnson seemed a bit confounded when trying to describe the sculpture, calling it a "curly-wurly pretzel-like object."
Indeed.
Perhaps the relationship between India and Britain can best be compared to the Kapoor/ArcelorMittal contraption. We're not really sure what it is, but it's got everyone talking.

HEADLINE: A Bad Start on Immigration Reform

BYLINE: LAWRENCE DOWNES


HIGHLIGHT: The resurrected STEM Jobs Act is a tweaked version of a bad bill that died earlier this year in the House, and it's bad for the same reasons as before. 

 BODY:
Representative Lamar Smith, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, is offering a new version of an old immigration bill that's due to be voted on this week. It's being touted by supporters as a signal that the Republican Party understands the election message sent by voters - particular Latinos and Asians - in favor of immigration reform. 
Don't be fooled. The resurrected STEM Jobs Act is a tweaked version of a bad bill that died earlier this year in the House, and it's bad for the same reasons as before. The bill increases visas for immigrants skilled in STEM fields -- science, technology, engineering and math -- by eliminating another visa category entirely: the "diversity" visas set aside for people from countries with relatively low immigration rates to the United States. 
Here's the math: add 55,000 new visas for immigrants with advanced STEM degrees. Take away 55,000 diversity visas. A zero-sum game, in pro-immigrant disguise.

To sweeten the deal for Democrats, Mr. Smith has added another provision - to reunite some families of immigrants with green cards. Currently, relatives of legal permanent residents have to wait years overseas to get their own green cards before they can rejoin their families. The Smith bill would allow some of those who are waiting for green cards to spend that waiting period in the United States. But they would not be allowed to work. Families would suffer - not just from the financial burden, but also the risk of deportation, if they choose to risk working illegally to avoid economic hardship.
High-tech industries need workers. Families need to be reunited. But not on these meager terms. If Mr. Smith had been serious, not cynical, about an immigration measure, he could have negotiated with Democrats, come up with something better on family reunification and drafted a more defensible bill. 
He didn't, and this is what we're left with: an old strategy, repackaged. If the Republicans are going to offer real immigration reform, they will have to do better than this.

HEADLINE: Hurricane Sandy vs. Hurricane Katrina

BYLINE: ANDY NEWMAN


HIGHLIGHT: City Room crunched some numbers to truth-squad Governor Cuomo's claim that Hurricane Sandy was "more impactful" than Hurricane Katrina. 

 BODY:
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo made headlines and raised eyebrows Monday when he said that while Hurricane Katrina was deadlier than Hurricane Sandy, the latter storm was "more impactful" over all and "affected many, many more people and places than Katrina." 
Mr. Cuomo added that Hurricane Sandy had a greater economic impact, destroyed or damaged more units of housing, affected more businesses and caused more customers to lose power. Here are the statistics he backed that up with.
Does the governor's comparison seem warranted to you? Leave a comment below.
For our part, City Room decided to undertake a little truth-squadding. While apples-to-apples numbers for the two storms are very difficult to come by, especially given that Hurricane Sandy's costs are still being tallied, here are our findings. (Figures are for the United States unless otherwise noted.)

 Storm Type at Landfall 
 Katrina: Category 3 hurricane, Aug. 29, 2005 (second landfall).
 Sandy: Post-tropical cyclone, Oct. 29, 2012.
 Deaths 
 Katrina: 1,833.
 Sandy: More than 200 in 7 countries, including 132 on the U.S. mainland.
 Buildings Damaged or Destroyed 
 Katrina: 1.2 million housing units damaged, including 126,000 "severely damaged or destroyed" -- includes Hurricanes Rita (Sept. 2005) and Wilma (Oct. 2005).
 Sandy: N.Y.: 305,000 housing units damaged or destroyed. N.J.: estimated 72,000 buildings damaged. Conn.: 3,000 homes damaged.
 Estimated Cost 
 Katrina: $148 billion (2012 dollars) in "total damages/costs."
 Sandy: $71 billion in New York and New Jersey, including $9 billion in New York for preventive work. $360 million in Connecticut.
 Insured Losses 
 Katrina: $48.7 billion (2012 dollars).
 Sandy: $16 billion to $22 billion.
 Homes Without Power 
 Katrina: About in at least 8 states.
 Sandy: 8.51 million in 16 states and Washington, D.C.
 FEMA Assistance 
 Katrina: 738,318 applications approved.
 Sandy: 465,000 applications filed in N.Y. and N.J., FEMA said Tuesday.
 People Displaced 
 Katrina: Up to 600,000 families homeless a month after the storm.
 Sandy: Officials still compiling data.

HEADLINE: For Statue of Liberty, a Lonely End to the Year

BYLINE: TRISTAN HALLMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Storm damage will keep Liberty and Ellis Islands, as well as the statue, off-limits to the public for months, a determination that led to 400 layoffs. 

 BODY:
The Statue of Liberty, which was open to the public for just one day this year before Hurricane Sandy struck, will remain closed for at least the rest of the year, keeping tourists at a distance and putting hundreds of people out of work. 
There is no projected date to reopen the statue or Liberty and Ellis Islands, according to the National Park Service. The decision led to the layoffs of 400 people who work on the islands or ferry visitors there, Crain's New York Business reported Monday. 
The Park Service is preparing a report on the damage to the national monument complex, which had nearly 3.8 million visitors in 2011.
"As soon as we're able to make it safe, we'll reopen it for visitors," said Mike Litterst, a Park Service spokesman.
The statue, a 126-year-old gift from France, had been closed the whole year for $30 million in renovations, but reopened, briefly, on Oct. 28, its dedication anniversary, which was the eve of the storm's arrival. The enduring symbol of freedom remained intact, but the islands' infrastructure sustained damage.
With business down, Statue Cruises, which ferries visitors to the islands, laid off 130 workers. The ferry service is still operating some harbor cruises past the island, said Michael Burke, Statue Cruises' vice president.
"We're hoping that the National Park Service will allow visitor access as early as possible, even if it's in a limited capacity," Mr. Burke said.
About 100 people who provide security and other services on Liberty and Ellis Islands were laid off.
The islands' souvenir and concessions vendor, Evelyn Hill, Inc., laid off 170 workers, and is now down to 3 employees, said the company's president, Bradford Hill. The company also lost hundreds of thousands of dollars in inventory, he said.
Evelyn Hill has operated at the Statue of Liberty for 81 years, dating back to the days when immigrants passed through Ellis Island to start new lives. The company will continue, Mr. Hill said.
"We've weathered World War II, the centennial and 9/11," Mr. Hill said. "We'll certainly weather through this as well."

HEADLINE: Ten Ways to Investigate Transition in China

BYLINE: TOM MARSHALL


HIGHLIGHT: What kind of place is China right now, and how can teachers and students get their arms around it? With help from Times reporters, we have assembled a collection of vignettes -- 10 ways of looking at the country. 

 BODY:
The United States wasn't the only superpower to weather a nail-biting political transition earlier this month. Power changed hands in China, too, amid public worries about economic decline, corruption and unrest.
Ordinary Chinese citizens received no ballot or invitation to "Eighteenth Big," the once-a-decade handover to a seven-member ruling committee at the 18th Communist Party Congress. But, just like in America, the transition prompted a very public airing of the issues facing China's 1.3 billion people.
What kind of place is China right now, and how can teachers and students get their arms around it? With help from reporters from The New York Times, we have assembled a collection of vignettes - 10 different ways of looking at the country. Together they offer a portrait of a nation whose fate will shape the world's future.
 Ten Ways to Investigate Transition in China 
Classes can use the stories below in a variety of ways, and in any order, to gain a better understanding of the issues facing China in 2012. Here are some ways you might teach with them:

        
Divide students into groups to analyze a story, re-enact a scene or situation, and then summarize key points, with classmates scoring them on the quality of both the performance and lessons about China. 
        
Students could use the stories to research and present a list of recommendations for the new leadership in China, or advise the Obama Administration on how to deal with the country over the next four years. 
        
Individual students can also choose a story from the list and design a poster or display as part of a class-wide China Fair, or use a story as a starting point for further research in the archives of The New York Times.
        
If you are teaching some aspect of Chinese history, you might challenge students to use these vignettes as a starting point and find parallels, patterns or relationships between the China of the past and the China of the present. 
 China today is a place where: 

        
 Political events are highly scripted, until they're not. Read this story about what the 18th Party Congress looked like to one reporter, and this piece about an 11-year-old girl who spoke her mind about food safety concerns. What was the reaction when the girl appeared to depart from the tightly organized event, and do you think her actions will lead to trouble for her - or positive changes?
        
 It helps to have friends in high places. Xi Jinping, the new Communist Party chief and supreme leader, was raised as a so-called "princeling," the son of a top military leader from China's revolution. Other members of China's seven-member ruling Politburo Standing Committee have also benefited from political connections, according to new research, as have their families. How does this differ from the rise of political leaders in the United States or other countries, and what challenges might it pose for the development of democracy in China? How would you advise politically-minded Chinese youth to plan their careers if they want to get ahead? 
        
 People can go to jail for protesting, but many do so just the same. There are many ways of speaking out in China, and it's not always clear what sorts of dissent will be effective or lead to trouble. Read about dissident Ai Weiwei and Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo, both of whom have gone to prison after vigorously criticizing their government. Then watch this video about a Chinese lawyer who filed a lawsuit over a 16-cent grievance, and read stories about protests over a new petrochemical factory, striking workers' demands, land grabs in rural China, and a personal essay by a defiant author. Based on these sources, what sorts of dissent seem to be permissible in China? Should people speak up more or push quietly behind the scenes if they're seeking controversial changes?
        
 The iPhone was "perfected" in six weeks. The reporters Charles Duhigg and Keith Bradsher describe how a factory boss in China roused 8,000 workers from their dormitory beds one night and put them to work when Apple co-founder Steven P. Jobs demanded last-minute changes. Search the story for clues on how America lost the iPhone business to foreign countries and how China, in particular, offered manufacturing advantages for Apple. Then read columnist Thomas Friedman's analysis about the challenges facing American workers and students, and this story about an American company that exports plumbing fixtures to China. How must companies and workers in America or other countries adapt in order to compete with China?
        
 But employees are starting to resist poor working conditions. Watch this video on working conditions in electronics factories, or read this story on the human costs of "The iEconomy." Do foreign companies seem to be trying to make conditions better in their factories? Under what conditions are workers speaking out?
        
 The government owns many businesses, and mild economic growth means trouble. In America, the debate is over how much the government should help companies or bail them out in times of trouble. But in China, the government already owns a majority stake in 35 percent of the country's businesses, pulling in around 43 percent of all profits. And many Chinese companies report they're unable to sell everything they produce. What are the economic challenges facing China in 2012, and what should the country do to keep its economy healthy?
        
 The outside world frets about China's intentions. Does China pose a military, economic or environmental threat to other nations? What sorts of actions by China are drawing the most concern abroad, and are officials taking steps to address those concerns? Do a keyword search with the terms "China influence" in the archives of The New York Times and Google, and catalog the issues and countries where concerns have been raised. Then read recent stories about territorial disputes in East Asia. Do China's actions seem to pose a genuine threat to others, or is the country pursuing its interests in a similar fashion to that of other influential nations like the United States?
        
 New leaders worry about corruption. Watch out for the "worms" of corruption, China's new Communist Party leader warned in his first major speech, or they will devour both the party and the nation. Top officials have also vowed to do a better job of anticipating risks before launching big projects that could harm people or the environment. Is this the dawn of a new China? Are these pronouncements a sign of new determination by the government to pursue changes, or is the government too corrupt to reform itself?
        
 Officials deploy old weapons to curb bad behavior. Ancient parables may have gone out of style in modern China, but that doesn't mean they can't be updated to stem the generation gap and encourage young people to help their elderly parents. Reading between the lines, what sorts of problems does China seem to be facing in caring for the older generation? Write some parables that address teen issues in America. Do you think governments can play a useful role in governing personal behavior?
        
 And ordinary people dream of the future. What do ordinary Chinese people wish for? It's a question many researchers and artists have asked in recent years amid the tumult of booming economic growth and rising expectations. Author and social policy expert Gerard Lemos set up a modern version of traditional "wish trees" in the industrial city of Chongqing and collected citizens' responses. Photographer Lucas Schifres took portraits of factory workers and recorded some of their hopes. View both sources and write down some of the most compelling responses. Do their statements make you hopeful or pessimistic about the country's future?

HEADLINE: Buybacks Expected To Increase

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL POPPER

 BODY:
Investors are bracing for companies to ramp up purchases of their own shares in response to expected tax changes in the new year, despite growing criticism of buybacks.
Companies have two main ways to return cash to investors: paying money in quarterly dividends or repurchasing shares on the open market. A number of academics and investors, and a new industry survey, suggest that companies are likely to shift more money to buybacks after this year because taxes on those gains are expected to grow less than a proposed tax increase on dividends.
Peter C. Andersen, a portfolio manager at Congress Asset Management, expects share repurchases to increase and has added them to his list of the 10 most important things to consider when analyzing a stock. Last week, Mr. Andersen added News Corporation to the 23 other stocks in a mutual fund he runs because of, in part, the company's growing buyback program over the last two years.
''Dividends were the big thing,'' said Mr. Andersen, who manages the All Cap Opportunity mutual fund. ''I think we'll stop seeing that popularity, and the new focus will be on stock buyback programs.'' 
Wall Street and corporate America have been taking steps to prepare for the broad array of tax increases and spending cuts set to fall into place at the end of the year. While the White House and Congress are negotiating a compromise that could avert some of these changes, most executives and investors expect at least some tax rates to grow even if a deal is struck.
The Obama administration is pushing to sharply increase the rate at which dividends are taxed, to 39.6 percent from 15 percent. At the same time, the White House has proposed that the benefits derived from share repurchases, capital gains, be subject to a smaller tax increase: to 20 percent from 15 percent. Both types of investment income would also be hit by a 3.8 percent surcharge tied to the administration's health care legislation.
Companies including Wal-Mart and Las Vegas Sands recently decided to pay out their fourth-quarter dividend this year instead of early in 2013 to take advantage of the current tax rate on dividends. Some investors have sold off winning stock positions to lock in the current rate on capital gains. But while these are one-time changes aimed at capitalizing on existing rates, any moves to increase share buybacks could continue in the long run.
Mr. Andersen likes the prospect of more buybacks because he thinks they lift the price of a stock. Share repurchases are popular with executives because they lower the number of outstanding shares and increase the amount of profit per share, a popular measure used to evaluate companies and determine executive pay.
But some academics and investors believe the growth of the practice could lead to more misuse of corporate funds.
Gregory V. Milano, chief executive of Fortuna Advisors, said that companies frequently buy back their stock when it is at a peak; then the price drops, erasing any potential benefit to shareholders.
The number of share buybacks hit a low in 2009 when companies would have had the greatest advantage from buying their own shares. More important, he said, companies generally get lower returns from buying back stock than they do from investing in their businesses and staff.
Mr. Milano is expecting the number of buybacks to tick up with the coming changes, but he is not happy about it.
''When you buy back stock with money you could have reinvested, you not only deliver worse returns, you wind up employing less people,'' he said.
A surge in stock repurchases is still far from a sure thing. Taxes on dividends could rise less than is currently projected, allowing dividends to maintain their appeal to corporate executives. Even if those rates do rise, executives could choose to use their cash for other purposes, such as acquiring other companies or investing in new facilities and employees.
But in recent years, buying back stock has become one of the most popular ways for executives to use their excess cash.
In recent days, Chipotle, Starbucks and Bebe Stores all announced plans to ramp up their buyback programs.
Procter & Gamble executives announced this month that they were increasing the amount of money available for stock buybacks to $6 billion from $4 billion at the same time that they were preparing to lay off over 5,000 employees.
None of these companies has mentioned the prospect of tax increases as a motivating factor. But in a recent survey of 100 American companies, conducted by the financial data firm Markit, half of the companies willing to talk about their dividend policies said that if the tax rate on dividends increased, they were likely to shift money to share buybacks.
''You will see companies essentially scaling back their tendency to do dividends and moving into repurchases,'' said Douglas J. Skinner, an accounting professor at the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business. ''They won't do this radically, but the rate will increase from what it otherwise would have been.''
The surge in the popularity of both dividends and buybacks is attributed to, at least partly, the Bush administration's 2003 move to lower the tax rate on most investment income to 15 percent.
In the two years after those cuts, 145 new companies began paying out dividends, and 222 companies initiated buyback programs, according to a study led by Jennifer Blouin, an accounting professor at the University of Pennsylvania, and two economists at the University of North Carolina.
Companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 spent $2.7 trillion on buybacks from 2004 to 2011, and paid $1.8 trillion in dividends in the same time, according to a Credit Suisse research paper released in June. So far this year, companies have announced share buybacks worth over $220 billion, more than were announced in all of 2011, Markit found.
The 2003 tax cuts made dividends a more attractive option than they had been in the past, as compared with share repurchases, while the coming changes are set to work the other way, making buybacks more attractive than they currently are.
The study led by Ms. Blouin found that some companies showed a preference for dividends over buybacks after the 2003 changes particularly when the companies had board members who would benefit from the policies.
This time around, Ms. Blouin is expecting to see those same sorts of companies shifting their money to buybacks, which could make these companies more attractive to investors than dividend-paying companies.
''If you are looking to move out of a dividend-paying company, now you are going to look more favorably on a company that has a repurchase regime,'' Ms. Blouin said.
In the long run, though, investors who opt for buybacks may not benefit. By one recent estimate from Credit Suisse, most of the buybacks done by companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 index from 2004 to 2011 have not yet added much value for remaining shareholders.

HEADLINE: California Finds Economic Gloom Starting to Lift

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- After nearly five years of brutal economic decline, government retrenchment and a widespread loss of confidence in its future, California is showing the first signs of a rebound. There is evidence of job growth, economic stability, a resurgent housing market and rising spirits in a state that was among the worst hit by the recession.
California reported a 10.1 percent unemployment rate last month, down from 11.5 percent in October 2011 and the lowest since February 2009. In September, California had its biggest month-to-month drop in unemployment in the 36 years the state has collected statistics, from 10.6 percent to 10.2 percent, though the state still has the third-highest jobless rate in the nation.
The housing market, whose collapse in a storm of foreclosures helped worsen the economic decline, has snapped back in many, though not all, parts of the state. Houses are sitting on the market for a shorter time and selling at higher prices, and new home construction is rising. Home sales rose 25 percent in Southern California in October compared with a year earlier. 
After years of spending cuts and annual state budget deficits larger than the entire budgets of some states, this month the independent California Legislative Analyst's Office projected a deficit for next year of $1.9 billion -- down from $25 billion at one point -- and said California might post a $1 billion surplus in 2014, even accounting for the tendency of these projections to vary markedly from year to year.
A reason for the change, in addition to a series of deep budget cuts in recent years, was voter approval of Proposition 30, promoted by Gov. Jerry Brown to raise taxes temporarily to avoid up to $6 billion in education cuts.
''The state's economic recovery, prior budget cuts and the additional, temporary taxes provided by Proposition 30 have combined to bring California to a promising moment: the possible end of a decade of acute state budget challenges,'' the report said. ''Our economic and budgetary forecast indicates that California's leaders face a dramatically smaller budget problem in 2013-14.''
And 38 percent of Californians say the state is heading in the right direction, according to a survey this month by U.S.C. Dornsife/Los Angeles Times. For most places, that figure would seem dismal. But it is double what it was 13 months ago.
California's recovery echoes a rebound across much of the country; the state suffered not only one of the longest downturns but also one of the most severe. Economists say the turnaround, should it continue, is a positive harbinger for the nation, given the size and diversity of the state's economy.
Democrats here have been quick to argue that the improvements in fiscal conditions that the state is now projecting after voters approved the temporary tax increase may embolden other states, and Congress, to raise some taxes rather than turn to a new round of cuts.
Yet California still faces major problems. The economic recovery is hardly uniform. Central California and the Inland Empire -- the suburban sprawl east of Los Angeles -- continue to stagger under the collapse of the construction market, and some economists wonder if they will ever join the coastal cities on the prosperity train. Cities, most recently San Bernardino, are facing bankruptcy, and public employee pension costs loom as a major threat to the state budget and those of many municipalities, including Los Angeles.
A federal report this month said that by some measures, California has the worst poverty in the nation. The river of people coming west in search of the economic dream, traditionally an economic and creative driver, has slowed to a crawl.
Still, the fear among many Californians that the bottom had fallen out appears to be fading. Economists said they were spotting many signs of incipient growth, including a surge in rental costs in the Bay Area, which suggests an influx of people looking for jobs.
''I think the state is turning a corner,'' said Enrico Moretti, a professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley. He said that the recovery was creating regional lines of economic demarcation -- ''We are going to see a more and more polarized state,'' he said -- but that over all, California was emerging from the recession.
Richard K. Green, the director of the Lusk Center for Real Estate at the University of Southern California, said the foreclosure storm was beginning to subside, and fewer foreclosed homes were flooding the market. That has meant homes are selling faster at higher prices -- which means fewer homeowners owe more than their house is worth.
''The most important thing is, if you look at job growth in California for the last 18 months or so, it's been higher than average for the country,'' he said.
Jerry Nickelsburg, an economics professor at the Anderson School of Management at the University of California, Los Angeles, said the resurgence in coastal communities was spreading, if haltingly, to struggling inland communities, creating jobs for long-distance commuters who live in places like the Inland Empire.
In one sign of a new spirit, some Californians are again promoting the idea of their state's setting the cultural and policy pace for the rest of the country, a meme that, if ever true, appeared at least questionable as California endured cuts that diminished its once-great higher education system. Rick Jacobs, the head of the Courage Campaign, a liberal advocacy group, argued that Californians, by voting to raise their taxes, set a model Washington should follow in negotiations over how to avert the so-called fiscal cliff.
''One might argue that what happened in California will set the trend for what will happen in the country, meaning that opposition to taxing the wealthy is opposition to the future,'' he said.
Conservatives took a nearly opposite view, arguing that the state's latest tax increases and its thicket of regulations would drive out businesses and people.
''I was born and raised in California; I love the state, but I think California has been going downhill for quite a while,'' said Bradley R. Schiller, a professor of economics at the University of Nevada in Reno. ''The ignorance of voters is appalling, not to see their own self-interest in restoring their state.''
California has faced attacks by conservative leaders for much of this presidential election year, as they presented the state as a model of Democratic policies gone awry. Mitt Romney compared California to Greece. Peggy Noonan declared that the ''mythic place where Sutter struck gold'' had become a symbol of failure. ''California is going down,'' she wrote. The conservative Manhattan Institute devoted an 8,500-word report to ''The Great California Exodus.''
Gray Davis, a former Democratic governor, noted that voters had approved initiatives to begin repairing a notoriously dysfunctional government. It no longer takes a two-thirds vote of the Legislature to increase spending (the requirement remains for tax increases), and a nonpartisan election system went into effect this month.
''It's a fair criticism, but somewhat antiquated,'' Mr. Davis said. ''Help has arrived.''
''We've been used to being beat up by the Eastern Seaboard for a very long time,'' Mr. Davis said. It was, he said, a case of coastal envy: ''I can see the sun glistening off the ocean as I look out my office window.''
Joe Mathews, a co-author of ''California Crackup: How Reform Broke the Golden State and How We Can Fix It,'' said California's main challenge was its governing structure.
''There's a great history of trashing on us,'' he said. ''Just the same way people like to talk bad about the prettiest girl in school. As badly governed as we are, we have our strengths: in trade, venture capital, in weather.''
''There is reason to feel better for the state,'' Mr. Mathews said. ''I think the economy is coming back.''
Yet the surest sign of a resurgent California might have been captured by observant Twitter posters last week in Southern California. There, Mr. Romney -- he of California-is-Greece fame -- was spotted one day at Disneyland and another pumping gasoline into his S.U.V. before returning to his beachfront home in San Diego to celebrate Thanksgiving week.

HEADLINE: In Court Battle, a Game of International Brinkmanship With Argentina

BYLINE: By STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF. 
Steven M. Davidoff is a professor of law and finance at Ohio State University. His columns can be found at nytimes.com/dealbook. Follow @StevenDavidoff on Twitter.

 BODY:
Foreclose on a country?
It sounds far-fetched, but a United States court is saying that Argentina must set aside $1.33 billion for some American hedge funds and others. That decision is threatening to throw the South American country and the entire sovereign debt market into turmoil.
This game of chicken is a lesson on the hazards of United States courts' interfering in international affairs.
The origins of the mess arise from Argentina's status as a sometime deadbeat debtor. In 2001, the country defaulted on more than $80 billion worth of sovereign bonds. Historically, a default like this leaves bondholders with few options. There is no global bankruptcy process and individuals can't force a country to pay. A century or so ago, creditor countries would sometimes send in gunboats and troops to force payment.
These days, the lawyers and bankers are sent in, as a default usually leads to a restructuring of the country's debt. Typically, the creditors are forced to take a haircut while the country pays something to try to maintain access to the global credit markets. 
This is what happened in Argentina. In 2005 and 2010, Argentina restructured its debt offering to exchange the old bonds for new bonds at the paltry sum of 25 to 29 cents on the dollar. Argentina was able to push bondholders to accept such a low price because the offer was coupled with a new law passed by its Legislature making it illegal for the country to pay the old bonds. In other words, it was either the new bonds or nothing.
But there were holdouts, including thousands of Italian pensioners, who own what is now about $11 billion in debt.
The holdouts also included a number of hedge funds, some of which had acquired this debt as far back as the 1990s, seeing an opportunity for a big return, despite the risk. The group also includes Elliott Management and Aurelius Capital Management.
Elliott, a $20 billion hedge fund founded by Paul Singer, is one of the leaders in this field. It previously made outsize returns investing in defaulted sovereign debt and trying to force the country to pay by seizing its assets. For about $2 million, for example, Elliott bought sovereign debt with a face value of more than $30 million that was issued by the Republic of Congo. The fund was able to win a $100 million judgment in England and intercept $39 million worth of oil owned by the Republic of Congo. In the case of Argentina, Elliott recently was able to get a Ghanaian court to order the seizure of an Argentine frigate.
While the standoff over the frigate is embarrassing for Argentina, it is a sideshow to the litigation by Elliott and Aurelius in New York
A few years ago, Elliott and Aurelius changed their legal tack. They argued in court that the pari passu clause in the bond documents - common language in such documents that says that the investors cannot be treated differently - required that if Argentina paid any money on its new bonds it also had to pay the old defaulted holders. "Pari passu" is a Latin phrase that roughly means "on equal footing." It is intended to ensure that if a debtor issues new debt, it cannot be superior to the old debt.
Argentina showed up in Federal Distric Court for the Southern District of New York and through its lawyers heatedly argued that these clauses merely required Argentina to treat bondholders legally the same, not make equal payments, as the funds argued.
It's an arcane legal argument, and most legal scholars and those in the market sided with Argentina, stating that this was how debt restructuring had worked for decades.
But in October, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit disrupted this precedent, siding with the hedge funds. The court held that the pari passu clause required Argentina to pay the hedge funds on the old debt any time it made a payment on the new debt.
Argentina has a $3 billion payment on its new bonds due on Dec. 15. Last week, Judge Thomas P. Griesa of Federal District Court piggybacked on the Court of Appeals decision, ordering that if Argentina made this payment, it and any third parties through which this money was transferred would also have to set aside $1.33 billion, the entire amount owed to the hedge funds, to pay the old debt equally.
It's now chaos. Many believe that Argentina will simply default on all of its debt, refusing to pay the new debt to avoid paying the hedge funds - which have been deemed "vultures" by the country's politicians.
Hernn Lorenzino, Argentina's economy minister, reacted angrily to the court decisions, saying that they were "a kind of legal colonialism" and that all "we need now is for Griesa to send us the Fifth Fleet."
The uncertainty has affected Argentina's capital markets. Its stock market fell on the news, and credit-default swaps on Argentine debt have skyrocketed in price as the markets worry about yet another Argentine default.
Elliott and Aurelius are no doubt giddy. The current bondholders are wondering how they got dragged into this dispute.
This decision will also have real effects on global finance. Most bonds issued by sovereigns contain pari passu clauses, and this type of exchange was par for the course for country debt restructuring. (Just think of Greece.) And while bonds have changed in recent years to accommodate workouts and may be under the laws of different countries, it is still unclear whether these circumstances will affect the Court of Appeals ruling, as Anna Gelpern, a noted scholar in this area, has written. The ability of a country to achieve a workout and avoid this type of guerrilla action just got harder and more uncertain at a time of debt restructuring in Europe.
This is not supposed to happen.
The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976, which exempts sovereign nations from litigation, was enacted to avoid this. It prevents United States courts from attaching the property of foreign countries, a reason you don't see American creditors seizing Argentine frigates in New York harbor. But in the suit by Elliott and Aurelius, the courts sidestepped this act by ruling that their decision reflected how Argentina should act, without requiring it to pay. If Argentina decides not to pay the new debt, it does not have to pay the old debt. Still, the spirit of the act seems violated. And it is bad news when United States judges are seen as controlling the destinies of foreign countries.
Argentina is no angel. It is deliberately avoiding repaying these bondholders, and it used its sovereign immunity to force a disadvantageous situation. And the country is busy nationalizing other assets, including the energy company YPF, signaling increasingly that it is a bad global citizen.
But the Federal District Court overseeing this case through a decade of tiring litigation seems more focused on cramped legal interpretations and the morality of debt than on the wider consequences of its rulings. The judge in the matter even called Argentina's actions "immoral" - whatever that means to hedge funds and to other investors in a world of finance where only numbers matter.
And the federal courts willfully entered into this quicksand, overturning decades of custom and practice in these deals. For a few federal judges to take such an extreme step and upset the entire debt market, not just Argentina's capital markets, seems a bit risky.
The next move belongs to Argentina, which is entering another court appeal. But whatever happens on appeal, it is unlikely that the country will pay the hedge funds anytime soon, meaning that this battle between the federal courts and the country is likely to intensify. What a mess.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: A Measure of Business Spending Unexpectedly Jumped 1.7% in October

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- A gauge of planned business spending increased by the most in five months in October, the Commerce Department said Tuesday, raising optimism that the sharp cutbacks in capital investment during the summer were abating. 
Fears of deep reductions in government spending and big tax increases early next year had caused firms to hunker down.
But orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, rose 1.7 percent last month, the department said.
''While the improvement in demand offers some encouragement that the worst of the malaise in capital investment may be behind us, there is little to suggest that this may be the beginning of any meaningful upturn,'' Millan Mulraine, a senior economist at TD Securities in New York, said.
The increase in so-called core capital goods orders well surpassed economists' expectations for a 0.5 percent decline.
Lawmakers and the Obama administration are engaged in talks to avoid automatic spending cuts and tax increases that could remove $600 billion from the economy early next year and threaten a new recession. Few visible signs of progress have emerged.
''With intense focus on the fiscal cliff and continued uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook in the new year, it remains to be seen whether the October advance can be maintained. It's not clear that it can be,'' Omair Sharif, an economist at RBS Securities in Stamford, Conn., said.''One month does not make a trend, and the trend firmly shows firms are still in a kind of a wait-and-see mode in terms of capital spending.''
Given the lag between orders and shipments, economists expect business investment to remain a drag on economic activity in the fourth quarter. Shipments of core capital goods declined in October for a fourth straight month, and economists said the stronger orders might not translate into improved shipments until early 2013.
Still, a few economists bumped up their meager fourth-quarter forecasts for gross domestic product slightly because the drop in shipments was smaller than they had expected. Core goods shipments are used to calculate business spending on equipment and software in the gross domestic product report.
In the third quarter, business spending tumbled for the first time since the 2007-9 recession ended, weighed down by the looming tax increases and reductions in federal spending, Europe's long-running debt problems and slowing global demand.
While weakness in business spending has been restraining growth, the housing market is gaining momentum, which should support the recovery.
Single-family home prices rose for an eighth straight month in September, a separate report showed. The Standard & Poor's/Case Shiller composite index of 20 metropolitan areas gained 0.4 percent in September on a seasonally adjusted basis.
''The strengthening in home prices is a plus for growth through various channels, including increased consumer spending because of wealth and confidence effects,'' said Jim O'Sullivan, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y.

HEADLINE: Slashing Its Outlook for Global Growth, Economic Agency Warns of Recession

BYLINE: By STEPHEN CASTLE

 BODY:
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development on Tuesday sharply cut its forecast for the world economy, warning that failure to end the euro crisis and avert a fiscal impasse in the United States could cause a global recession.
The organization, based in Paris, predicted that gross domestic product in its 34 member countries, all of which have developed economies, would expand 1.4 percent in 2013, significantly below the forecast of 2.2 percent it made just six months ago.
Even that forecast assumes that United States lawmakers reach a budget agreement to prevent billions of dollars in tax increases and automatic spending cuts from taking effect automatically at the end of the year. 
If the United States does not avoid that so-called fiscal cliff, ''a large negative shock could bring the U.S. and the global economy into recession,'' according to the forecast, written by Pier Carlo Padoan, the organization's deputy secretary general and chief economist.
Even leaving that possibility aside, the report makes for grim reading, particularly with regard to the 17-nation euro zone, which is mired in recession and is where the ''greatest threats to the world economy remain.''
''Challenging fiscal sustainability conditions in some countries risk sparking a chain of events that could considerably harm activity in the monetary union and push the global economy into recession,'' the report said.
Highlighting the continuing lack of economic confidence, the report urged European policy makers to accelerate efforts to bolster their common currency through the creation of a banking union.
''Temporary fiscal stimulus should be provided by countries with robust fiscal positions (including Germany and China),'' it added. ''Over the recent past, signs of emergence from the crisis have more than once given way to a renewed slowdown or even a double-dip recession in some countries,'' the report said, adding that ''the risk of a new major contraction cannot be ruled out.''
The group expects the United States economy to grow 2 percent in 2013 and 2.8 percent in 2014, provided a fiscal deal is reached. In Japan, G.D.P. is expected to expand 0.7 percent in 2013 and 0.8 percent in 2014.
The euro area, it said, probably would remain in recession until early 2013, leading to a contraction in G.D.P. of 0.1 percent next year before growth of 1.3 percent in 2014.
Labor markets remain weak, with about 50 million jobless people in the organization's member countries. Unemployment is expected to remain high, or even rise further, in many countries unless structural measures are used to lift employment growth, the report said.
''The world economy is far from being out of the woods,'' the group's secretary general, ngel Gurra, said in a statement. ''Governments must act decisively, using all the tools at their disposal to turn confidence around and boost growth and jobs, in the United States, in Europe and elsewhere.''
Tom Rogers, a senior economic adviser at Ernst & Young, said the report was ''consistent with our view that the euro zone faces another year of stagnating economic output and rising unemployment, and that the medium-term recovery is likely to be weaker than from previous recessions.''
Although much has been achieved in stabilizing the euro area, ''more needs to be done to deepen the fiscal and banking unions, to improve medium-term growth prospects through reform, and to broaden the single market to include trade in services,'' Mr. Rogers wrote in a note.

1912 Attempt On Life of Police Chief
LONDON -- An attempt to murder Sir Edward Henry, Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, was made outside his residence, in Campden House Court, last night [Nov. 27]. Sir Edward was fired at three times by a man named Alfred George Bowes, who was arrested. Only one of the three shots fired hit Sir Edward. He was struck in the left groin, but the bullet did not penetrate deeply. The bullet passed straight through the flesh, and was afterwards found in the underclothing. There is no danger except from possible septic poisoning. Sir Edward had alighted from his automobile and was entering the house, when the man, who had been waiting on the other side of the road, rushed up and said: ''I want to speak to you.'' The Commissioner waved him on one side, and at that moment Bowes produced his revolver and fired three shots. 
1937 Cereal Product Causes Cancer
Philadelphia -- A step toward the fuller understanding of cancer and its causes was revealed today [Nov. 27] when Dr. Leonard G. Rowntree, director of the Philadelphia Institute for Medical Research, addressed the American Philosophical Society. An unidentified substance, created when crude germ oil is extracted from wheat or other cereals by means of ether, is the most powerful agent yet discovered for the experimental forming of cancers in the stomachs of rats, Dr. Rowntree told the gathering. This is the first plant product which has been discovered to cause cancer merely by being eaten, and it is considered a most important clue to the origin of the disease.
1962 Belgium, U.S., Warn Katanga
WASHINGTON -- The United States and Belgium, fearful of a new Congo crisis, tonight [Nov. 27] threatened ''severe economic measures'' unless secessionist Katanga quits blocking a genuine settlement. President Kennedy and Belgian Foreign Minister Paul-Henri Spaak, after a one-hour meeting at the White House, issued a joint communiqu. It said: ''If there is not substantial progress within a very short period of time, the United States government and the government of Belgium fully realize that it will be necessary to execute further phases under the United Nations plan, which includes severe economic measures.''

HEADLINE: Richard J. Mack

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO

 BODY:
Mr. Mack, 45, is a founding principal, along with his father, William L. Mack, of AREA Property Partners, a real estate operator, investor, fund manager and lender.
AREA, founded in 1993, has invested around $14 billion in over 600 transactions worldwide, including the Time Warner Center and the Apthorp condominium in New York.
Interview conducted and condensed by 
VIVIAN MARINO
Q. How much of your portfolio is in the New York region?
A. I would say probably about 25 percent of what we do is in the New York area.
Q. Is most of your focus these days in the multifamily sector?
A. We are opportunistic in how we view the world, and so we see the risk-adjusted returns favoring the residential sector. Over the last three years we've been one of the most active buyers of multifamily. We bought nearly 25,000 units across the country.
Q. You've also gained control of properties through debt purchases, like the Apthorp condominium on the Upper West Side. What's happening there in terms of improvements to the building?
A. Most of the value-add that needed to occur to the common areas has already been done. But upgrading the finishes and combining units is something that we continue to do.
Some like to finish the units themselves, so we are making a unit-by-unit decision. The biggest value-add that we're bringing to that property is stable ownership. It's making people feel comfortable that the asset is properly capitalized. They don't have to worry about another financial crisis.
We have everything from four-bedrooms to studios.
Q. How else are you adding value to your acquired properties?
A. Value-add for us is a style of investing. We are buying cash-flowing assets that have some need of improvement. In multifamily space, for example, we're looking for properties that have been overleveraged and therefore financially starved of investment. So there's deferred maintenance. So we're fixing roofs and clubhouses and things like that. We also look at investing in the units, where we think that upgrading the units we can get higher rents.
Q. What about investing in condos?
A. We think that the multifamily sector is very, very resilient and has been driven by things other than economic growth, really demographic forces. But I also think there's an element of people wanting to rent, believing that home prices are only going to go up. So you have this large change in attitude about homeownership and demographic forces.
A shock in the condo market could come from a disruption in the economy. So we are concerned about taking too much risk on the condo side. We are approaching it right now with preferred equity and mezzanine as a way to enter the business, but we're not ready to take on more risk from a common equity perspective.
Q. Who are your main investors?
A. They are the largest public pension funds in the U.S. and some of the largest sovereign wealth funds in the world. We have them from the Middle East as well as other places that seem to be exporters of capital these days.
Q. What's the minimum investment in your funds?
A. The minimum is usually $5 million. It's primarily institutions, but we do have high-net-worth investors who can make that investment and those who have been investing with us for very long periods of time who we can be somewhat more flexible with.
Q. What kind of rates of return are you looking to get on your funds?
A. We target different rates of return depending on the risk we're taking. For our mezzanine funds we are looking for 12 to 15 percent; for our value-add fund we're probably looking for 13 to 16 percent; and for our opportunistic funds we're looking 16 to 20 percent.
Q. Your father, William Mack, is a prominent real estate investor, and also the chairman of the board of Mack-Cali Realty, one of the nation's largest publicly traded real estate investment trusts. Was he also your mentor?
A. My father definitely has been a mentor -- whether on purpose or by osmosis. Growing up, going out to the construction sites when you're a kid definitely has an impact on you. Even if you want to get away from real estate it's kind of hard. It was kind of in my blood.
My father is kind of the senior statesman and the chief critic. It's been fantastic to have him there to serve both of those roles. I think what I learned most from my dad was probably lessons on humility and how to treat people in the world, and that your word is your bond.

 BODY:
Syracuse
SINCE 1974, when the Justice Department sued to break up the Ma Bell phone monopoly, Americans have been told that competition in telecommunications would produce innovation, better service and lower prices.
What we've witnessed instead is low-quality service and prices that are higher than a truly competitive market would bring.
After a brief fling with competition, ownership has reconcentrated into a stodgy duopoly of Bell Twins -- AT&T and Verizon. Now, thanks to new government rules, each in effect has become the leader of its own cartel. 
The AT&T-DirectTV and Verizon-Bright House-Cox-Comcast-TimeWarner behemoths market what are known as ''quad plays'': the phone companies sell mobile services jointly with the ''triple play'' of Internet, telephone and television connections, which are often provided by supposedly competing cable and satellite companies. And because AT&T's and Verizon's own land-based services operate mostly in discrete geographic markets, each cartel rules its domain as a near monopoly.
The result of having such sweeping control of the communications terrain, naturally, is that there is little incentive for either player to lower prices, make improvements to service or significantly invest in new technologies and infrastructure. And that, in turn, leaves American consumers with a major disadvantage compared with their counterparts in the rest of the world.
On average, for instance, a triple-play package that bundles Internet, telephone and television sells for $160 a month with taxes. In France the equivalent costs just $38. For that low price the French also get long distance to 70 foreign countries, not merely one; worldwide television, not just domestic; and an Internet that's 20 times faster uploading data and 10 times faster downloading it.
America's Internet started out as No. 1 in speed. It now ranks 26th, far behind the networks in Bulgaria, Ukraine and Lithuania. Americans pay the sixth highest median price in the modern world for Internet data -- 16 times the rates paid by South Koreans, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
Just as serious is the problem of coverage: in France, South Korea and other modern countries a superfast Internet is or will soon be available everywhere. In America, AT&T's fiber optic lines stop short of homes and small businesses, while Verizon plans to end its fiber-optic installation work once it reaches 18 million residences.
As of now huge parts of the United States will never get on the information superhighway but will rather slog along on the digital equivalent of a country road. This presents a genuine economic threat to America: the future industries and jobs that require a universal ultra-high-speed network, after all, will most likely be developed somewhere else.
But the problem is more immediate for consumers. That's because both of these cartels are telling lawmakers that they need less regulation, not more. A lighter government hand, they say, will mean more competition and yield a better deal for consumers.
In practice, though, deregulation has meant new regulations -- written by corporations and for corporations -- that have often thwarted competition and run roughshod over the customer.
Few know, for example, that since 1913, Americans have had a legal right to telephone service at any address -- or did until recently. Asserting that we now live in a world of competitive telecommunications, the Bell Twins have already managed to repeal this right in at least six states (Alabama, California, Florida, North Carolina, Texas and Wisconsin). And the cartels are apparently working vigorously to extend this repeal. Doubters have only to count the lobbyists hovering around state legislatures: in Kentucky, AT&T employs 36 of them.
The new regulations have the potential to leave some customers with only mobile telephone service, which does not work in many areas. Moreover, some proposed new rules, if adopted, may actually put people at risk: AT&T, for instance, has suggested shutting down its old copper wire system -- the only telecommunications platform that worked in some areas after Hurricane Sandy because it relies on a separate, minimal supply of electricity.
The remedy for these anti-consumer practices is straightforward: bring back real competition to the telecom industry. The Federal Communications Commission, the Justice Department and lawmakers have long said this is their goal. But absent new rules that promote vigorous competition among telecom companies, it simply won't happen.
Just as canals and railroads let America grow in the 19th century, and highways and airports did so in the 20th century, the information superhighway is vital for the nation's economic growth in the 21st. The nation can't afford to leave its future in the hands of the cartels.

HEADLINE: Simple Start of a Bold Vision For Downtown Los Angeles

BYLINE: By PETER SLATIN

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- For more than a decade, civic leaders and developers here have envisioned a large-scale redevelopment of downtown Los Angeles's main civic and cultural thoroughfare, Grand Avenue. This past summer, the first -- and smallest -- component of this vision finally opened to the public. But instead of a massive mixed-use edifice that would completely change the streetscape, it was a modest 12-acre space named Grand Park, which replaced an existing but unwelcoming civic center plaza.
The park was paid for by $50 million from Related Companies, the developer planning the nearby building projects. 
Community leaders, real estate magnates and urban planners hope the Grand Avenue Development Project, which would add several million square feet of commercial and cultural space, will provide a center of gravity and excitement to an area of the city that has lacked both.
For now, Related's plans for a mixed-use building modeled loosely on its Time Warner Center in New York, which houses a hotel, retail stores, offices, condominiums and a major jazz stage, have been delayed. But a $130 million modern art museum, housing the collection of and paid for by the philanthropist Eli Broad and designed by Diller Scofidio + Renfro, was under construction and planned for completion by early 2014. Related also recently broke ground on a 24-story, 271-unit luxury rental building adjacent to the Broad museum, with 20 percent of the units designated as affordable housing.
The park was supposed to be part of a later phase of development, said Bill Witte, president and chief executive of Related California. But that changed when the recession struck, undermining the condo sales market that was a bedrock of Related's vision.
As a result, the fate of the mixed-use linchpin of the broad scheme is uncertain. Related has until February 2013 to come up with financing, which will almost certainly be prohibitively costly in the current market.
Related won the right to build the project in 2004. In theory, though, it could lose that right, and a new selection process could be started.
Gloria Molina, a Los Angeles County supervisor who is widely credited with pushing for redevelopment of the old civic center mall and for getting Related to pay for it, was doubtful that Related can move forward as planned. ''I don't see the economy shaping up that quickly,'' she said.
Ms. Molina was, perhaps, looking for Related to alter its proposal.
''I'm hoping they will have something more realistic and attainable,'' she said. ''I'm not sure the original vision will be sustainable.''
Mr. Witte said that Related had applied for an extension on its February deadline from the city and county's joint powers authority, but declined to comment other than to say ''we are very committed to getting this done.''
Despite clusters of skyscrapers and civic buildings that house some half-million workers in downtown Los Angeles, the area contained fewer than 20,000 residents in the late 1990s, according to the Downtown Los Angeles Center Business Improvement District. New or renovated apartment buildings began to open early in the new decade, and today's population is just under 50,000. Downtown also has the Staples Center, which anchors the LA Live entertainment district.
The proposed Related project is meant to dovetail with the Frank Gehry-designed Disney Concert Hall, which opened in 2003 at the summit of Grand Avenue. Farther down the avenue, the Music Center also welcomed the idea of an expanded consumer base.
At present, the park stands alone. It was designed by the Los Angeles-based landscape architects Rios Clementi Hale Studios, a firm that had already directed an expansion and renovation of the sidewalks and walkways that are part of the Music Center complex.
The Music Center has a pivotal role in the future of the park: event programming. Thor Steingraber, vice president for programming at the center, said he loved the flexibility afforded by the park for things like impromptu concerts. ''You can have a family event at 11 a.m. and a serious concert at 7 p.m.,'' he said.
To underscore the park's special characteristics, the inaugural event featured Bandaloop, a professed vertical dance company of aerialists, performing against the backdrop of Los Angeles City Hall. The event drew 5,000 spectators, said Mr. Steingraber.
As most audiences are expected to do, this one gathered on the ''Event Lawn,'' one of several programmable spaces in the park, which drops about 90 feet in grade from its highest point along Grand Avenue to its lowest, three blocks away at Spring Street. Other spaces include a Performance Lawn, a Community Terrace and a Flag Garden.
Tony Paradowski, a designer on the project at Rios Clementi Hale Studios, said that the landscape had been divided into ''24 floristic gardens'' containing plants from around the globe, ''based loosely on where Los Angeles' population has come from,'' he said. That intermingling was meant to embody the park's role as a mixing point for downtown's residents, workers and tourists. Much of the park's design was generated through a series of community meetings, said Mr. Paradowski.
''They were some pretty simple things -- a place to read a book, some shade, open space, get some food,'' he said.
While there is a small dog run -- requested by community members -- there is no playground.
Ms. Molina said: ''No, we don't have monkey bars. It's not that kind of a facility. The whole place is a playground.''
She said she saw significant possibilities for expansion, however.
The multiple entities behind the park -- city, county, Music Center -- have applied for an additional $11 million in grant financing. In addition, the county was negotiating to buy a state-owned land parcel adjacent to the park.
For the future, Ms. Molina has her eye on two hulking civic buildings also adjacent to the park that she says are ''old and antiquated and need to be torn down. They are compromised in many ways and not useful in any way.''

HEADLINE: A Comment on the Budget Impasse Sends Markets Lower

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Stocks slumped on Wall Street Tuesday after the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, said he was frustrated by the lack of progress in talks over the fiscal situation in Washington.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 89.24 points, or 0.69 percent, at 12,878.13. The Dow and other indexes had been moving between small gains and losses for most of the day, then turned lower after Mr. Reid's comments in the early afternoon.
''We have to get away from the happy talk and start talking about specific things,'' Mr. Reid told reporters in televised comments. 
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 7.35 points, or 0.52 percent, to 1,398.94 and the Nasdaq composite index lost 8.99 points, or 0.30 percent, to 2,967.79.
Worries about the budget talks have been hanging over the stock market for weeks. Stocks slumped immediately after the Nov. 6 election over concerns that politicians would be unable to reach a deal to trim the deficit and extend some of the Bush tax cuts before a Jan. 1 deadline.
If that deadline is not met, under current law a series of sharp tax increases and spending cuts will come into effect. Economists have warned that the measures could push the economy back into a recession.
''The markets are getting whipped around, rather sharply, on headlines,'' said Sal Arnuk, co-founder of Themis Trading. ''For example, Harry Reid feeling we're not making enough progress on the fiscal cliff.''
Last week stocks pared some of the losses that came after the election. President Obama plans to make a public case this week for his strategy for dealing with the issue as he pressures Republicans to allow tax increases on the wealthy while extending tax cuts for families earning $250,000 or less.
While stocks have gained this year as the Federal Reserve has maintained its bond-buying stimulus program, concern about global growth and the budget fight in Washington might limit further advances, said Uri Landesman, president of Platinum Partners, a New York-based hedge fund. The S.& P. is up 11 percent this year and the Dow 5 percent.
''The glass is half-empty right now,'' Mr. Landesman said.
A report that suggested that the outlook for the nation's economy might be improving failed to encourage investors to push stocks higher.
The government said companies in the United States increased their orders for machinery and equipment last month, a sign that business investment is rising. Orders rose 1.7 percent in October, the best showing since a 2.3 percent rise in May.
ConAgra advanced $1.34, or 4.7 percent, to $29.63 after it agreed to buy Ralcorp for $5 billion in a deal that will make it the nation's biggest maker of private-label foods. Ralcorp surged $18.57, or 26.4 percent, to $88.80.
Corning, a specialty glass maker, rose 78 cents, or 6.9 percent, to $12.13 after it said that North American television sales were stronger than expected in the fourth quarter, increasing demand for its products.
Las Vegas Sands rose $2.33, or 5.3 percent, to $46.36 after the casino operator said it would pay a special dividend of $2.75 a share, distributing about $2.26 billion to shareholders before the end of the year.
Monster Beverage, a maker of energy drinks, rose $6.09, or 13.3 percent, to $51.97 as concerns eased about increased regulation for the company after a letter to senators from the Food and Drug Administration was made public on Tuesday.
Interest rates were lower. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 8/32, to 99 28/32 and the yield fell to 1.64 percent from 1.67 percent late Monday.

HEADLINE: The Bargainer Who Remade the Old Ball Game

BYLINE: By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN

 BODY:
Marvin Miller, an economist and labor leader who became one of the most important figures in baseball history by building the major league players union into a force that revolutionized the game and ultimately transformed all of professional sports, died on Tuesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 95.
His death was announced by the Major League Baseball Players Association. He had liver cancer, his daughter, Susan Miller, said.
When Mr. Miller was named the executive director of the association in 1966, club owners ruled much as they had since the 19th century. The reserve clause bound players to their teams for as long as the owners wanted them, leaving them with little bargaining power. Come contract time, a player could expect an ultimatum but not much more. The minimum salary was $6,000 and had barely budged for two decades. The average salary was $19,000. The pension plan was feeble, and player grievances could be heard only by the commissioner, who worked for the owners. 
By the time Mr. Miller retired at the end of 1982, he had secured his place on baseball's Mount Rushmore by forging one of the strongest unions in America, creating a model for those in basketball, football and hockey.
Never had the dugout been so business-minded. The average player salary had reached $241,000, the pension plan had become generous, and players had won free agency and were hiring agents to issue their own demands. If they had a grievance, they could turn to an arbitrator.Peter Seitz, the arbitrator who invalidated the reserve clause and created free agency in 1975, called Mr. Miller ''the Moses who had led Baseball's children of Israel out of the land of bondage.''
But not only them. If Mr. Miller had one overarching achievement, it was to persuade professional athletes to cast aside the paternalism of the owners and to emerge as economic forces in their own right, often armed with immense bargaining power. The changes he wrought in baseball rippled through all of pro sports, and it could be said that he, more than anyone else, was responsible for the professional athlete of today, a kind of pop culture star able to command astronomical salaries and move from one team to another.
Still, though his contributions to baseball were compared to those of Babe Ruth, who made the home run an essential part of the game, and Branch Rickey, who broke the major leagues' color barrier when he signed Jackie Robinson to the Brooklyn Dodgers, Mr. Miller has not been recognized by the Baseball Hall of Fame.
''There's been a concerted attempt to downplay the union,'' Mr. Miller told The New York Times, referring to the Hall, when he narrowly missed out on election in December 2010, the fifth time he had been on the ballot. ''It's been about trying to rewrite history rather than record it. They decided a long time ago that they would downgrade any impact the union has had. And part of that plan was to keep me out of it.''
A Series of Showdowns
Mr. Miller, an economist by training, had bargained on behalf of the steelworkers' union but lacked the charisma of fiery old-style labor leaders like the mineworkers' John L. Lewis or the New York City transport workers' Mike Quill. A silver-haired man with a mustache he had cultivated since he was 17, he was typically described as calm, patient, even-keeled. Nonetheless, he got results.
''Miller's goal was to get his ballplayers to think like steelworkers -- to persuade members of the professional class to learn from members of the working class,'' Malcolm Gladwell wrote in The New Yorker in 2010.
Everett M. Ehrlich, a business economist and an under secretary of commerce in the Clinton administration, said that Mr. Miller's victories owed much to the changing structure of the game, particularly baseball's expansion to the West Coast and the South, which led to greater television and attendance revenue. The new money allowed many ball clubs to spend heavily on players no longer tied to their teams.
''Luck is the residue of opportunity and design,'' Mr. Ehrlich wrote on his blog in 2010, quoting Rickey. ''Free agency,'' he added, ''was an important accomplishment, and it made baseball better, but it also happened at a propitious moment. It takes nothing away from Miller to note that.''
Though Mr. Miller never convinced the owners that they could prosper from an upheaval of baseball's economic order -- they would discover that eventually -- he outmaneuvered them at every turn. ''I loved baseball and I loved a good fight, and in my mind, ballplayers were among the most exploited workers in America,'' Mr. Miller wrote in his memoir, ''A Whole Different Ball Game'' (1991), recalling his decision to take charge of the players association when it was in effect a company union.
He had his share of fights. The players went on strike for 13 days in 1972 (part of the exhibition season and nine regular-season days); they were locked out of spring training for almost a month in 1976; they struck for the final eight days of the 1980 exhibition season; and staged a 50-day strike that began in the middle of the 1981 regular season.
Mr. Miller was portrayed by many on the management side as a harbinger of economic ruin.
''There was about Miller a wariness one would find in an abused animal,'' Bowie Kuhn, the baseball commissioner during most of Mr. Miller's tenure, wrote in his memoir, ''Hardball'' (1987). ''It precluded trust or affection.''
But Mr. Miller did win the trust of the ballplayers.
''I don't know of anyone who changed the game more than Marvin Miller,'' said Robin Roberts, a Hall of Fame pitcher for the Philadelphia Phillies, who played a key role in the hiring of Mr. Miller by the players' union. ''His legacy is that through his work, ballplayers for the first time attained dignity from owners.''
Marvin Julian Miller was born in the Bronx on April 14, 1917, and grew up in Flatbush rooting for the Brooklyn Dodgers. His father, Alexander, was a salesman for a clothing company on the Lower East Side in Manhattan, and as a youngster Marvin walked a picket line in a union organizing drive. His mother, Gertrude Wald Miller, who taught elementary school, was a member of the New York City teachers union.
Mr. Miller graduated from New York University in 1938 with a degree in economics. He resolved labor-management disputes for the National War Labor Board in World War II and later worked for the International Association of Machinists and the United Auto Workers. He joined the staff of the United Steelworkers Union in 1950, became its principal economic adviser and assistant to its president, and took part in negotiating contracts.
Late in 1965, there were stirrings within the major league ballplayers' ranks about the need for improvements in a pension plan implemented by management in 1947. The players had a union of sorts, but their association, established in 1954, had no full-time employees, did not engage in collective bargaining, had never challenged the reserve clause and had $5,400 in the bank.
The baseball stars Jim Bunning (later a United States senator from Kentucky), Harvey Kuenn and Mr. Roberts sought a professional bargainer who would get ballplayers better pensions. Mr. Miller was recommended to them by George Taylor, who ran the War Labor Board when Mr. Miller worked for it.
Mr. Miller was uncertain about entering the professional sports world, and many players were hesitant about creating a formal union. Most were relatively uneducated, had little experience with unions and had been told by the owners for years that they should be grateful to be paid for playing a boys' game.
In the spring of 1966, when Mr. Miller toured the training camps in Arizona and Florida to speak with the players before they voted on whether to hire him as executive director, he was often met with suspicion.
Before Mr. Miller's first meeting with the team, ''we were all expecting to see someone with a cigar out of the corner of his mouth, a real knuckle-dragging 'deze and doze' guy,'' Jim Bouton, the former Yankees pitcher, was quoted saying by John Helyar in the book ''The Lords of the Realm: The Real History of Baseball'' (1995). But the players were surprised, he said, when ''in walks this quiet, mild, exceedingly understated man.''
Working with his newly hired general counsel, Richard M. Moss, Mr. Miller educated the players to trade-union thinking. In 1968, the union negotiated the first collective bargaining agreement in pro sports. In 1970, players gained the right to have grievances heard by an impartial arbitrator. In 1973, they achieved a limited right to have salary demands subjected to arbitration.
On April 1, 1972, just as spring training camps neared their close, the players staged the first major strike in North American sports history in a dispute over the level of owner contributions to their pension plan.
Mr. Miller wrote in his memoir that when the strike was announced, Paul Richards, a longtime baseball man who was an executive with the Atlanta Braves at the time, remarked that ''Tojo and Hirohito couldn't stop baseball, but Marvin Miller could.''
The strike caused the cancellation of 86 regular-season games before a compromise was reached.
Later in 1972, the outfielder Curt Flood, having refused to accept a trade from the St. Louis Cardinals to the Philadelphia Phillies, was rebuffed by the Supreme Court when he challenged the reserve clause.
But in December 1975, Mr. Seitz, the baseball arbitrator, ruling in a case brought by the pitchers Andy Messersmith and Dave McNally and argued by the union, invalidated the reserve clause in the standard player contract. Mr. Seitz found that this clause, allowing all contracts to be extended for one year at management's option upon their expiration, did not mean that contracts could be extended in perpetuity. Once a player refused to re-sign after the expiration of that one-year extension, Mr. Seitz ruled, he could sell his pitching prowess or hitting skills to the highest bidder.
The owners immediately fired Mr. Seitz, mounted a futile court challenge to his ruling and, in late February 1976, expressed their rage by putting off the opening of spring training camps. Mr. Kuhn, the commissioner, ordered the camps opened in mid-March.
In July 1976, the union and management agreed on limitations to free agency: a player would need six years of major league service before he could seek a deal with another club. That accord seemed like a concession Mr. Miller did not need to make. But he concluded that limiting the stream of free agents would fuel the ball clubs' bidding wars.
He was proved correct. In 1976, the average annual player salary was $51,000. Soon the checkbooks opened. George Steinbrenner signed two future Hall of Famers for the Yankees: the power-hitting outfielder Reggie Jackson, who received a five-year, $2.9 million contract after the 1976 season, and the relief pitcher Goose Gossage, who got a six-year, $3.6 million deal after the 1977 season.
As salaries soared, revenue flowing to the players' pension fund swelled, a result of a major increase in network payments to baseball for rights to telecast the World Series, the All-Star Game and the ''Game of the Week.'' The pension fund received a third of baseball's receipts from national TV rights, a share that went from $8.3 million a year to $15.5 million a year in a four-year contract agreement reached in May 1980.
The spending sprees eventually encompassed the entire major league landscape. But free agency remained a highly contentious issue. On June 12, 1981, the players began a 50-day strike over the owners' demands concerning compensation to teams that lost players who became free agents. Management ultimately obtained only minor concessions.
Kenneth Moffett, the federal mediator in the 1981 strike, became the union's executive director in January 1983, when Mr. Miller retired, but was dismissed after 10 months and ultimately replaced by Donald Fehr, the union's general counsel since 1977. Mr. Fehr guided the union through a host of battles with management, including a strike that canceled the 1994 World Series. He retired from his post in 2009 and was replaced by Michael Weiner, the union's general counsel at the time, who remains its chief.
Mr. Fehr is now the executive director of the National Hockey League Players' Association, which remains locked in a labor dispute with owners that has delayed the opening of the season.
Shut Out of Cooperstown
Mr. Miller's candidacy for the Baseball Hall of Fame fell short five times in balloting from 2003 to 2010 by committees voting on candidates who had not been elected in the regular balloting by baseball writers. December 2007, when Mr. Miller was turned down for a third time, Mr. Kuhn, the baseball commissioner who had been his longtime adversary and had died the previous March, was elected to the Hall.
The management of the Hall does not vote on candidates for Cooperstown. But the committees that considered Mr. Miller -- their numbers ranging from 12 to 84 over the years -- have included baseball executives. The breakdown of the voting has not been known; the Hall asks voters not to reveal whom they selected or turned down.
In 2010, Mr. Miller received 11 of the 12 votes required from a 16-member committee, consisting of 8 Hall of Famer players or managers, 4 executives and 4 baseball writers. His candidacy will not be up for a vote again until 2013.
Mr. Miller advised the union as a consultant through his 80s. He spoke out against contractual givebacks and changes in baseball's economic structure that might weaken the union. While in his 90s, he criticized the union's acceptance of mandatory drug testing, saying that it could hurt union solidarity and that ''it was clear that the government was going to get involved, and when the government gets involved, they will pick out targets, and the media just goes along with it.''
Besides his daughter, he is survived by his son, Peter; a sister, Thelma Berenson; and a grandson. His wife, Terry, died in 2009.
As players grew richer and the baseball figures from his union days faded from the scene, Mr. Miller said he worried that pioneering battles were being forgotten.
''I do feel a little irked and chagrined when I realize that the players have no idea that it was the union that changed everything,'' he told The New York Times in 1999. ''What's taken for granted are the salaries, the perks, free-agency rights, salary-arbitration rights, all of which were tremendous struggles.''
Still, Mr. Miller said, the owners tried hard to ''turn back the clock'' during his tenure -- and, he added, ''I don't believe they've ever given up.''
But baseball management and labor have been at peace since the 232-day strike that forced cancellation of the 1994 World Series. Today's ballplayers in the union that Mr. Miller built nearly a half century ago earn an average of more than $3 million a year.
In his mid-90s, Mr. Miller expressed satisfaction over more than the huge salary gains and freedom of movement his members enjoy, and he ultimately came to believe that the players finally appreciated what unionism meant.
''Succeeding generations of players know so much more about trade unionism, solidarity and what it can produce than their predecessors did,'' he told Sports Illustrated in 2011. ''I'm proudest of the fact that I've been retired for almost 29 years at this point, and there are knowledgeable observers who say that this might still be the strongest union in the country. I think that's a great legacy.''

HEADLINE: At Atlantic Yards, Ready to Test Plans for Prefab Tower

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
In a warehouse deep inside the Brooklyn Navy Yard, a small team of carpenters, electricians and engineers have secretly labored for months on an assembly system for turning tubular steel chassis into fully equipped apartments that can be stacked and bolted together at a construction site.
On Dec. 18, they will be put to the test, as Bruce C. Ratner, chief executive of Forest City Ratner, breaks ground for the world's tallest prefabricated, or modular, building, a 32-story residential tower at Flatbush Avenue and Dean Street. It is the first of 15 planned modular buildings at the $4.9 billion Atlantic Yards site; some are to rise to 50 stories. 
If it works, Mr. Ratner and his partners say, they will be at the forefront of a new industry.
It is an ambitious and risky undertaking, more so than the $1 billion Barclays Center arena that Mr. Ratner opened there three months ago.
For half a century, builders have sought to capture the promise of modular construction for high-rise housing: substantially lower construction costs, a quicker schedule, better quality and less waste.
Developers have built prefabricated single-family homes, jails and classrooms. But taller towers that could withstand wind shear and seismic forces were another matter altogether.
If Mr. Ratner has, as he claims, ''cracked the code,'' it could lead to more affordable housing, or it could simply mean greater profits for the developer.
''The engineering has been the challenge,'' said Tom Hardiman, executive director of the Modular Building Institute, a trade association for the modular-construction industry. ''No developer has put the time, and frankly, the money into engineering that Ratner has.''
Currently, the tallest modular building is a 25-story dormitory in Britain. In the United States, modular buildings rarely go above 10 stories. The cost of steel bracing has been prohibitive.
But next spring, 125 workers at the factory in Building 293 at the Navy Yard will begin churning out 930 modules -- typically 14 feet wide, 35 feet long and 10 feet tall -- equipped with floors, walls, electric lines, plumbing, kitchens, toilets, exterior facades and even towel racks.
''This is more than innovation,'' said MaryAnne Gilmartin, executive vice president of Forest City Ratner. ''We've cracked a code that will allow us to utilize cutting-edge technology to introduce greater affordability, more sustainability and world-class architecture.''
She said modular was suitable for both subsidized and luxury housing. Forest City says it hopes that other urban builders will use the technology. The company also sees a market for building prefabricated bathroom ''pods,'' which slide into the modules, and can also be used by conventionally built hospitals and other institutions.
A variety of modules, which come in different shapes, together with various glass and colored exterior panels, will break up the mass of the building so that it does not look like a Lego tower.
One by one, the modules will be put on flatbed trucks and carried one mile to the construction site, where a crane operator will lift the components into place, while steel braces are simultaneously erected to provide lateral support.
''Modular promises higher quality, greener construction, faster delivery time and lower costs,'' said Thomas Hanrahan, dean of Pratt Institute's architecture school in Brooklyn. ''The question is: Will the savings be passed on to the public in some form?''
Mr. Ratner began exploring modular construction during the recession in 2010 as a way to make good on his promise to use union labor, deliver good architecture and earmark at least 30 percent of the proposed 6,430 units for low- and moderate-income tenants. (Half of the 363 apartments in the first building will be for poor and working-class families.)
He replaced the architect Frank Gehry with SHoP Architects and worked with engineers from ARUP to devise a modular high-rise building. Forest City also worked with a modular builder in New Jersey, Kullman Offsite Construction, although they had a bitter breakup over terms and Mr. Ratner's decision to hire a group of Kullman's senior executives.
The solution to producing high-rise modular buildings came, in part, from the ability to create computerized three-dimensional models that allowed them to test the integrity of the engineering, Christopher Sharples of SHoP Architects said.
Sixty percent of the work will be done in the factory, which Forest City believes will save as much as 20 percent on construction costs and cut the delivery time to 18 months, from 28 months.
Ms. Gilmartin of Forest City warned that the first tower may be only marginally less expensive than a conventional tower, but that there should be increasing efficiency with each building at the site.
The developer obtained a financing commitment from Bank of New York and forged a partnership with Skanska, the giant construction company based in Sweden, and with union labor, the project's biggest supporter during years of opposition from some community groups.
Forest City and Skanska formed a company to operate the Navy Yard factory, with Skanska as the operating partner as well as the construction manager. The companies declined to reveal the start-up costs.
Last week, Mr. Ratner reached an agreement in principle with the city's construction unions. The unions had expected Atlantic Yards to be a conventional project, through which a carpenter could earn $85 an hour in wages and benefits.
Gary La Barbera, president of the Building and Construction Trades Council, acknowledged that the unions had lost ground to nonunion residential contractors in recent years and were largely absent from the affordable housing field.
Under the new agreement, Mr. La Barbera said union factory workers would earn $55,000 a year, 25 percent less than the average union construction worker. But, he said, the trade-off is that the factory worker will work steady hours throughout the year, regardless of the weather.
''We see this as an opportunity to get into markets we're not in,'' Mr. La Barbera said. We can't ignore an emerging industry. We see it as creating more job opportunities in residential construction.''

HEADLINE: M.T.A. Seeks Aid to Repair, and to Improve

BYLINE: By MATT FLEGENHEIMER

 BODY:
The feat of quickly restoring New York's transportation network after Hurricane Sandy has a substantial corollary cost: about $5 billion to rebuild what was damaged.
But a closer look at the cost estimates from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, released by the governor's office on Monday, provides a window into the agency's dual considerations as it counters unprecedented damage across the system: making short-term repairs to key structures, like subway equipment and tunnels, while enacting previously unplanned infrastructure improvements in the long term -- ideally with considerable assistance from the federal government.
''Even FEMA will tell you, don't replace in kind if you can replace and harden and improve,'' Thomas F. Prendergast, the president of New York City Transit, said on Tuesday, referring to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. ''And they're willing to pay for that cost.'' 
Officials said the estimates reflected the expected cost of restorations, not the value of damaged or destroyed pieces of equipment that were, in many cases, relics of the 20th century. Some of the equipment is no longer available. Other damaged pieces, like electromechanical relays, might be similar to their modern equivalents in basic design but less durable than an ideal replacement, Mr. Prendergast said.
The authority said that signal restorations alone would cost $770 million. Restoring tracks, it said, would cost $300 million. And repairing the Rockaway line in Queens was estimated to cost $650 million.
''We're going to pay for some of it,'' Mr. Prendergast said, referring to long-term investments in infrastructure. Nonetheless, he added, the agency was ''asking for 100 percent.''
Replacing the tunnel interior, ceilings, walls, roadway, lighting, and conduit of the Hugh L. Carey Tunnel, formerly known as the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel, will cost $400 million, the authority said. For similar work on the Queens-Midtown Tunnel, the estimated cost was $350 million.
Mr. Prendergast noted that the figures were ''order of magnitude'' estimates that were subject to change significantly. But he also hinted at the delicate art of securing disaster reimbursement.
''When you're dealing with third parties who may reimburse you, you never want to start low and then work high,'' he said, adding that ''you don't want to pad,'' either.
He said that if the authority could complete the required work for less than the cost of the initial estimates, ''we're not going to bill anybody for more.''
Even some of the agency's megaprojects, which avoided significant physical damage, were affected by the storm. The authority estimated storm-related costs of more than $20 million for its East Side Access project, which will connect the Long Island Rail Road in Queens to Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan.
A spokesman said this was largely the result of delays to the projects, incurred when contractors were not able to get their workers on site or facilitate deliveries.
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo also said Monday that it would cost the state $9 billion to prepare for future storms; a portion of that money is expected to go to the authority.
Nicole Gelinas, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research who studies transportation economics, said the authority might be hindered ultimately by what she called a state approach of ''getting a huge, huge number out there and pretty much hectoring Congress into giving it all to New York right now, or else.''
Ms. Gelinas said she was particularly concerned that the ''extra political pressure that comes with supposedly free money'' could cause the agency to give the wrong projects priority.
''See the Fulton Street Transit Center after 9/11,'' she said.
The $1.4 billion Fulton Center project, set for completion in 2014, incurred $800,000 in storm costs associated with construction delays, the authority said.

HEADLINE: Broader Tax For Fighting Inequality

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER. 
E-mail: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardo

 BODY:
Rarely have we experienced such a confluence of arguments in favor of raising taxes on the rich. After a hard-won re-election fought mainly over taxes and spending, President Obama arguably has a mandate from voters to tap the wealthy to address our budget woes.
What's more, raising more money from the wealthy might go a long way toward righting our lopsided economy -- which delivered 93 percent of our income growth in the first two years of the economic recovery to the richest 1 percent of families, and only 7 percent to the rest of us.
Yet while raising more taxes from the winners in the globalized economy is a start, and may help us dig out of our immediate fiscal hole, it is unlikely to be enough to address our long-term needs. The experience of many other developed countries suggests that paying for a government that could help the poor and the middle class cope in our brave new globalized world will require more money from the middle class itself. 
Many Americans may find this hard to believe, but the United States already has one of the most progressive tax systems in the developed world, according to several studies, raising proportionately more revenue from the wealthy than other advanced countries do. Taxes on American households do more to redistribute resources and reduce inequality than the tax codes of most other rich nations.
But taxation provides only half the picture of public finance. Despite the progressivity of our taxes, according to a study of public finances across the industrial countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, we also have one of the least effective governments at combating income inequality. There is one main reason: our tax code does not raise enough money.
This paradox underscores two crucial lessons we could learn from the experience of our peers around the globe. The first is that the government's success at combating income inequality is determined less by the progressivity of either the tax code or the benefits than by the amount of tax revenue that the government can spend on programs that benefit the middle class and the poor.
The second is that very progressive tax codes are not very effective at raising money. The corollary -- suggested by Peter Lindert of the University of California, Davis in his 2004 book ''Growing Public'' -- is that insisting on highly progressive taxes that draw most revenue from the rich may result in more inequality than if we relied on a flatter, more ''regressive'' tax schedule to raise money from everybody and pay for a government that could help every American family attain a decent standard of living.
Consider government aid for families. According to the O.E.C.D. study, our Temporary Assistance for Needy Families is the most progressive program of cash benefits for families among 22 advanced countries, accurately targeted to serve the poor.
But American family cash benefits are the least effective at reducing inequality. The reason is that they are so meager. The entire budget for cash assistance for families in the United States amounts to one-tenth of 1 percent of the nation's economic output. The average across the O.E.C.D. nations is 11 times bigger. Even including tax breaks and direct government services, we spend a much smaller share of our economic output on family assistance than almost any other advanced nation.
The same pattern can be found across a range of government programs. The reason is always the same: their relatively small size. Over all, government cash benefits in the United States -- including pensions, disability, unemployment insurance and the like -- contribute about 10 percent to household income, on average, according to the study. The average across industrial nations is twice that.
Our budget reveals a core philosophical difference with other advanced countries. In the big-government social democracies like those of Western Europe, government is expected to guarantee a set of universal public services -- from health care to child care to pensions -- that are considered basic rights of citizenry. To pay for this minimum welfare package, everybody is expected to contribute proportionately into the pot.
Government in the United States has a different goal. Benefits are narrower. Social Security and Medicare follow a universal service template, but only for older Americans. Other social spending is aimed carefully to benefit the poor. Financed through a more progressive tax code, it looks more like charity than a universal right. On top of that, our philosophical stance virtually ensures a small government.
Progressive taxes make it hard to raise money because they distort people's behavior. They encourage taxpayers to reduce their tax liability rather than to increase their pretax income. High corporate taxes encourage companies to avoid them. High taxes on capital income also encourage avoidance and capital flight. High income tax rates on top earners can discourage work and investment, too. So trying to raise a lot of money with our progressive tax code would probably not achieve the goal and could damage economic growth.
Big-government social democracies, by contrast, rely on flatter taxes to finance their public spending, like gas taxes and value-added taxes on consumption. The Nordic countries, for instance, have very low tax rates on capital income relative to income from work. And they have relatively high taxes on consumption. In Denmark, consumption tax revenue amounts to about 11 percent of the nation's economy. In the United States, sales taxes and excise taxes on cigarettes and other items amount to roughly 4 percent.
Liberal Democrats have long opposed them because they fall much more heavily on the poor, who spend a larger share of their incomes than the rich. But these taxes have one big positive feature: they are difficult to avoid and produce fewer disincentives to work or invest. That means they can be used to raise much more revenue.
Public finances are under strain today on both sides of the Atlantic, as governments struggle to cope with our long global recession and the aging of the baby boom generation. In Southern Europe, the pressure to pare back universal welfare systems is intense. In the United States, political leaders on both sides of the partisan divide have realized that even our relatively meager package of social goods cannot be sustained with our slim tax take.
But the United States has one option that most of Europe's flailing economies do not. Its tax revenue is so low, comparatively, that it has more space to raise it. A more efficient, flatter tax schedule would allow us to do so without hindering economic activity.
Bruce Bartlett, a tax expert who served in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, told me last week that he thought federal tax revenue could increase to 22 percent of the nation's economic output, well above its historical average of 18.5 percent, without causing economic harm. If President Obama tries to go down this road, however, he may have to build a flatter tax code.
''We should reform the tax system, no question,'' William Gale, a tax policy expert at the Brookings Institution and co-director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, wrote in an e-mail. ''We are going to need to move beyond the current set of tax instruments to raise the needed revenues -- a VAT and or a carbon tax seem like the obvious ways to go.'' And Mr. Bartlett, who writes a column for The New York Times's Economix blog, also pointed out: ''We can't get all the revenue we need from the rich. Eventually, everyone will have to pay more.''

HEADLINE: Grudges Loomed Large In Hall's Snubs of Miller

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
Marvin Miller knew he belonged in the Baseball Hall of Fame, but he died on Tuesday excluded from it. He had turned a weak players union into a ferocious and wealthy labor force that transformed the sport's economics, yet the Hall is stocked with lesser-regarded executives who did not rattle baseball's hidebound establishment the way Miller did.
While leading the players to great gains, Miller became a revolutionary and almost certainly the most powerful man in baseball -- not Commissioner Bowie Kuhn, whose tenure closely paralleled Miller's. They were opposites: Miller the urbane economist bent on breaking an industry's antilabor policy, Kuhn the starchy lawyer guarding the status quo and arguing that baseball would be doomed if the reserve system were toppled for free agency. 
Five times from 2003 to 2010, voters failed to elect Miller to the Hall of Fame. He was rejected by veterans committees as small as 12 and as large as 84. In 2007, he suffered a double indignity: he was spurned twice.
With disdain and wit, Miller recognized that as long as his natural enemies -- current and former baseball executives -- were judging him, the odds of his election were slim.
In late 2007, after being told that he had received 3 of 12 votes, Miller laughed.
''You really could have done this in advance,'' he told The Associated Press. ''I think it was rigged,'' not to keep him out but to elect others with pro-management pedigrees. That year, those others were Kuhn, the nemesis he frequently outmaneuvered; Walter O'Malley, the Brooklyn Dodgers owner who relocated his team to Los Angeles; and Barney Dreyfuss, a long-ago Pittsburgh Pirates owner.
''Bowie Kuhn was a negative factor for baseball,'' Miller, who was 90 at the time of his third rejection, told The New York Times in 2007. ''Without any question, if he hadn't existed, we would have had to invent him.''
After being voted down that third time, Miller had every right to feel unwanted. Although each ballot roused partisans like Joe Morgan, Tom Seaver and union successors like Donald Fehr to argue for his election, Miller could not be hopeful. His dyspeptic view echoed somewhat that of Groucho Marx's -- he would not want to belong to a club that, after jilting him a few times, would make him as a member.
He did not have to worry.
Miller lost again in 2009, when 7 of the 12 members of the executives and pioneers committee voted for him. Jacob Ruppert, a long-dead Yankees owner with Hall-worthy credentials, also got seven votes. No one was elected by that panel, but John Fetzer, a deceased former Detroit Tigers owner and mentor of Commissioner Bud Selig's, received one more vote than Miller.
Miller's supporters wanted him to be elected to the Hall while he could enjoy it, unlike the Chicago Cubs star Ron Santo, who was posthumously inducted last July. To promote Miller's case in advance of the 2010 vote, Bob Locker, a former Chicago White Sox pitcher, created a Web site, ThanksMarvin.com, that was packed with tributes to Miller.
At the time, Locker said, ''He ought to have a statue in front of the Baseball Hall of Fame -- and every other sports hall of fame.''
The balloting in that election represented Miller's closest brush with victory: he fell short by one vote.
The rejection came from the newfangled Expansion Era committee, with former players making up half the 16-man group that judged his achievements. They elected, instead, Pat Gillick, whose influence as an executive for the Blue Jays, the Orioles, the Mariners and the Phillies was great, but whose effect on the sport was nowhere as transcendent as Miller's.
Miller had prepared himself for the fifth rejection. At 93, his hearing was failing, but he was sharp and argumentative. He saw it coming.
In an interview shortly after Gillick's election, Miller said that the Hall was snubbing the players association more than him and that there was a ''concerted attempt'' by the Hall to ''downgrade any impact the union has had.'' He added, ''Part of the plan was to keep me out of it.''
He sounded pragmatic, not paranoid, in tossing out the theory.
''You can leave individuals out, but you can't leave out an organization,'' he said. ''You can't leave out the impact the union has had. You can't be anything but fraudulent if you pretend that you are the archivist and recorder of the history of an institution like Major League Baseball and leave the union out of it.'' He added, ''I have more fame than I would have had in the Hall of Fame.''
Miller's next chance at election is next year. If he gets in, someone else will have to give the acceptance speech on his behalf. Whatever he would have said -- and how he would have said it -- almost certainly would have been an intriguing departure from speeches made by grateful players, managers, executives and umpires.

HEADLINE: Comparing Hurricanes: Katrina vs. Sandy

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN

 BODY:
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo made headlines and raised eyebrows Monday when he said that while Hurricane Katrina was deadlier than Hurricane Sandy, the latter storm was "more impactful" over all and "affected many, many more people and places than Katrina." 
Mr. Cuomo added that Hurricane Sandy had a greater economic impact, destroyed or damaged more units of housing, affected more businesses and caused more customers to lose power. Here are the statistics he backed that up with.
Does the governor's comparison seem warranted to you? Leave a comment below.
For our part, City Room decided to undertake a little truth-squadding. While apples-to-apples numbers for the two storms are very difficult to come by, especially given that Hurricane Sandy's costs are still being tallied, here are our findings. (Figures are for the United States unless otherwise noted.)
Storm Type at LandfallKatrina: Category 3 hurricane, Aug. 29, 2005 (second landfall).Sandy: Post-tropical cyclone, Oct. 29, 2012.
DeathsKatrina: 1,833.Sandy: More than 200 in 7 countries, including 132 on the U.S. mainland.
Buildings Damaged or Destroyed Katrina: 1.2 million housing units damaged, including 126,000 "severely damaged or destroyed" -- includes Hurricanes Rita (Sept. 2005) and Wilma (Oct. 2005).Sandy: N.Y.: 305,000 housing units damaged or destroyed. N.J.: estimated 72,000 buildings damaged. Conn.: 3,000 homes damaged.
Estimated CostKatrina: $148 billion (2012 dollars) in "total damages/costs."Sandy: $71 billion in New York and New Jersey, including $9 billion in New York for preventive work. $360 million in Connecticut.
Insured LossesKatrina: $48.7 billion (2012 dollars).Sandy: $16 billion to $22 billion.
Homes Without PowerKatrina: About 3 million in at least 8 states.Sandy: 8.51 million in 16 states and Washington, D.C.
FEMA Assistance Katrina: 738,318 applications approved.Sandy: 465,000 applications filed in N.Y. and N.J., FEMA said Tuesday.
People DisplacedKatrina: Up to 600,000 families homeless a month after the storm.Sandy: Officials still compiling data.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Shoppers' Enthusiasm Is Coming Back, But Many Are Exercising Caution, Too

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD, CHRISTINA CAPECCHI and CHRISTOPHER MAAG

 BODY:
Angelina Sam couldn't afford to celebrate Christmas last year, serving peanut butter, soup and rice for the holiday meal. And she didn't buy gifts for her husband or 2-year-old son.
But last week, Ms. Sam had already done five rounds of holiday shopping by the time she headed out for Black Friday specials in a suburb of St. Paul.
''The money was not there,'' Ms. Sam said of last year. ''But this year, I'm very, very confident.''
Americans are feeling better about the economy than they have in four and a half years, data released Tuesday shows. Preliminary consumer confidence results for November by the Conference Board showed an uptick in confidence, with the index rising to a preliminary 73.7, the highest level since February 2008, from 73.1 last month. 
Retailers say they are hoping to cash in on that confidence, beginning last weekend with a deluge of discounts and specials meant to draw shoppers into their stores and onto their Web sites.
But while shoppers like Ms. Sam raised hopes that growing confidence might mean increased sales, economists and retail analysts have said many Americans -- even some upbeat ones -- continue to hold back. Concerns include volatile gasoline prices, the budget deficit and an impasse in Washington over taxation and fiscal policy.
''People are still cautious, and there's still a lot of uncertainty,'' said George R. Cook, professor of business administration at the University of Rochester's Simon business school.
Recent shopping trips with consumers in regions with particularly high and low consumer confidence suggested some of the challenges retailers are facing. The holiday season is critical to retailers' profits, and helps increase consumer spending and the overall economy, but while traffic over the Thanksgiving weekend increased, sales in stores fell on that Friday, traditionally the busiest day of the year. And retailers needed to offer steep discounts to draw customers.
While rising confidence seems to move in line with consumption growth, said Amna Asaf, an economist at Capital Economics, ''it appears that the small uptick in November's consumer confidence is unlikely to provide much of a boost to consumer spending. We need to get more certainty about the direction of the fiscal cliff before we can see a marked impact.''
Ms. Sam, the Minnesota shopper, said her economic situation improved significantly over the last year. But things were so tight for Veronica Lynagh, 29, of Columbus, Ohio, that she had put her family on a strict holiday budget. Consumer confidence in the region including Ohio was relatively low, at 62.9 in October, before rising to 76.3 in November.
Ms. Lynagh and her husband, Matt, allotted $700 for the family's holiday shopping. To help stay focused, Ms. Lynagh created a color-coded spreadsheet to track income and spending. The couple say they will not buy any presents with credit cards, using debit cards only, and will only buy items on special.
''It would be really stupid to pay full price this season when all the stores have such good deals,'' Ms. Lynagh said.
For the Lynaghs, the year has required a series of financial trade-offs. Ms. Lynagh quit her marketing job at The Columbus Dispatch to stay home with their baby, born last December. Mr. Lynagh, 30, a distribution manager at an auto-parts supply company, traded in his Dodge Ram for a Mazda S.U.V. to save $250 a month on gas. They have refinanced their home, saving $200 a month, and begun putting whatever they can into savings.
They are worried about the political environment, they said. ''Our government is spending money we don't have,'' said Ms. Lynagh, who is starting a job as a marketing consultant.
While Ms. Lynagh minded their daughter after their Thanksgiving meal, Mr. Lynagh drove to a nearby Toys ''R'' Us, arriving 15 minutes after midnight. He trotted to the nearest uniformed employee and asked where an item on his list, a Fisher-Price animal farm, was located.
The employee guided him to it, but Mr. Lynagh did not bite.
''It's on the list, but it's not on sale,'' he said. ''If it's not on sale, I'm not buying it.''
Retailers say they are counting on there being more Ms. Sams out shopping in the coming weeks than Mr. Lynaghs -- and more places like St. Paul than Columbus. The region including Minneapolis and St. Paul had the highest consumer confidence in the nation last month, at 88.4, which jumped to 93 in the preliminary November figures.
(Consumer confidence is measured on a scale in which 100 represents the 1985 level of consumer confidence; a reading of 90 and higher indicates confidence, and the highest level on record was 144.7 in 2000.)
Ms. Sam, a Ghanaian immigrant, was ready for the holiday season, having paid off her $1,000 Visa bill earlier in the year. An energetic shopper, she hurried through five stores in five hours on the Friday after Thanksgiving. She grabbed a $49 Nook e-reader at Target for her brother in Ghana; a $24.99 Disney Cars bike for her son at Kmart; a $6.88 Disney Cinderella watch for her niece at Walmart; and a $49.99 luggage set from Kohl's for her mother.
Every time a cashier told her how much she had saved, she squealed with delight.
Ms. Sam said it was all made possible by a grueling work schedule. A nurse's aide, she took a second full-time job this year, adding an eight-to-12 hour evening shift to her schedule. She now works as many as 100 hours a week, for $13 to $15 an hour. (She took Thursday night off, so she could find some deals.) Her husband has a full-time engineering job.
''Sometimes I get tired,'' Ms. Sam said, ''and that is to be expected, but I want the best for my son. So I have to work hard for him, just so he doesn't have to work a double job in order to survive.''
Ms. Sam seemed almost mystified by the extra income this year. ''This year there are leftovers,'' she said. ''We can save money and put some into our son's account. We still have extra money to spend.''
It was not enough extra that Ms. Sam could indulge after buying presents for relatives: she bought nothing for herself. ''I don't think about me,'' she said. ''I think about my family. If they're happy, I'm happy.'' She added, ''Maybe when I'm done shopping, I'll give Santa my list.''

HEADLINE: Now Touring, the Debt Duo, Simpson-Bowles

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Theirs is an improbable buddy act that is making for unlikely entertainment from campuses to corporations on a most serious subject: the federal debt. The proof of their appeal: some business groups pay them $40,000 each per appearance. Really. To discuss budgets and baselines.
Ladies and gentlemen, coming soon to your city or town (if they have not been there already, and maybe even if they have) are the latest odd couple of politics: the 67-year-old Democratic straight man, Erskine B. Bowles of Charlotte, N.C., and his corny 81-year-old, 6-foot-7 Republican sidekick, Alan K. Simpson of Cody, Wyo.
Since the perceived failure two years ago next week of the bipartisan fiscal commission they led for President Obama, they have been on the road, sometimes solo but often together, perfecting a sort of Off Broadway show that has kept their panel's recommendations alive, and made them a little money as well. 
That so many people from Bellevue, Wash., to Sanibel Island, Fla., and from Waterville, Me., to Dana Point, Calif., talk about ''Simpson-Bowles'' (or ''Bowles-Simpson'') as if it is shorthand for the solution to the nation's fiscal woes -- even though few know its devilish details on tax increases and spending cuts -- is testament to the men's indefatigable efforts.
And so is the fact, not unrelated, that both the men and their plan could still play a role as Mr. Obama and Congressional leaders negotiate to avert a looming fiscal crisis in January.
On Tuesday, Mr. Bowles and corporate executives he helped recruit to a ''Fix the Debt'' campaign met privately at the White House with six senior administration officials, including Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner.
The commission's report ''could have just been put into the dustbin,'' said David M. Cote, the chief executive of Honeywell and a panel member. ''Instead,'' Mr. Cote added, ''it's become the basis for all of this discussion.''
He jokes that Mr. Bowles has achieved a status like Sting or Bono: ''He is known by one name -- everybody just calls him 'Erskine' now.''
Such quirky celebrity is clear evidence that there are second acts in politics.
Mr. Simpson, a former Senate Republican leader who retired in 1997 after three terms, and Mr. Bowles, an investor, a former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton and a failed Senate candidate, have created a new model for the afterlife of capital commissions. Instead of playing the usual insiders' game -- in which big-name commissioners report to the Washington big shots, only to see their work buried on a shelf -- these two have gone outside the Beltway to maintain pressure for action.
The Washington Speakers Bureau, a stable of politicians and pundits for hire, provided added inducement. It sought to re-sign Mr. Simpson, who had been on contract after leaving the Senate, after the commission reported in December 2010. He, like Mr. Bowles, had been flying weekly to Washington without compensation; Mr. Simpson said he had spent about $25,000 of his own money to upgrade from government-rate coach seating to premium-class seats able to fit his frame. He contacted his pal.
''I said: 'Erskine, would you want to do any of this? I know that may not be your bag, but I certainly have still embraced the capitalistic system,' '' Mr. Simpson recalled. ''He said, 'Yeah, as long as I do it with you.' ''
Initially they made up to $32,000 each, Mr. Simpson said, then $36,000 and now $40,000. But they often appear without a fee, including at colleges and city economic clubs. The two men have done countless interviews, for newspaper reporters, doctoral students and middle school report-writers; have sat for rural radio stations and for ''60 Minutes''; and have lectured both on campuses and to campuses, as Mr. Simpson did by Skype from Wyoming last week to a class here at American University.
They have addressed Rotary Clubs and corporate conventions; in coming days, they will speak at Bank of America and to investment groups in Manhattan.
''Erskine is the numbers guy; I'm the color guy,'' Mr. Simpson said.
The two often mix substance and sarcasm. For instance, in a recent appearance on Bloomberg TV, Mr. Simpson turned to Mr. Bowles for the correct figure on Social Security's negative cash flow, and then joked that if lawmakers could not compromise on that issue and others, ''You should never be in a legislature, and you sure as hell should never get married.''
The night after Mr. Obama celebrated his re-election in a Chicago hotel, Mr. Bowles, solo, was there as the keynote speaker for about 800 financial analysts, members of the CFA Society of Chicago. Keith Cardoza, the chairman, said the $40,000 cost was worth it ''for somebody as accomplished and experienced as Mr. Bowles.''
The Simpson-Bowles road show began two years ago when, after months of deliberations, 11 of the 18 commission members -- 5 Democrats, 5 Republicans and 1 independent -- backed the chairmen's plan to reduce annual deficits at least $4 trillion in the first decade with tax increases and cuts in military and social spending.
While the support was greater than expected, it was short of the 14 votes needed to force immediate action in Congress. The executive director, Bruce Reed, now chief of staff to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., urged the chairmen to soldier on.
''Together we decided, Let's don't let this thing die,'' Mr. Bowles said. ''Bruce convinced Al and me that the plan we put together could be the gold standard.''
They quickly raised money, including from Peter G. Peterson, the billionaire financier of antideficit efforts, to keep a small staff. They began working with the bipartisan ''Gang of Six'' senators (now eight) to write the report into legislation -- ''the Cialis project,'' Mr. Bowles privately joked, borrowing from the advertising slogan for an erectile dysfunction drug, ''When the moment is right, will you be ready?''
In Minneapolis recently, they visited both the newspaper, which then ran a supportive editorial, and business leaders in hopes of influencing Minnesota lawmakers like Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat. They are booked soon at the University of Kentucky in the home state of Senator Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader.
''It's an outside game, and it's been very effective,'' said Senator Tom Coburn, an Oklahoma Republican who was on the commission. ''It certainly has been with the business community. And I think a lot of Americans are for it.''
Not all, certainly. Many progressives oppose its proposed savings from Social Security and Medicare. Many conservatives resist proposed tax increases and military cuts. Officials in the White House and in Congress grouse that few Simpson-Bowles fans are aware of particulars, like new gasoline taxes and higher capital gains taxes on inheritances. And critics say the chairmen have oversold the idea, which Republicans have embraced, that Washington can raise revenues by curbing popular tax breaks instead of raising tax rates.
Last February, Mr. Obama was so irked by criticism that he had rejected Simpson-Bowles that he had Mr. Bowles to lunch to explain his long-term strategy for using the $4 trillion framework, if not all the details, to press Republicans to accept tax increases and Democrats to reduce entitlement spending.
Mr. Bowles recounted, ''He felt that after the election -- if he couldn't get something done before then -- he would have a real chance to negotiate with the Congress on a balanced deal.''

HEADLINE: House Republican Urges Party to Yield on Tax Cuts for Most Earners

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN; Jackie Calmes contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A senior House Republican on Tuesday urged his party's leadership to embrace the immediate extension of the Bush-era tax cuts for households earning less than $250,000, then fight out the fate of higher-income tax breaks later.
In a private meeting of the House Republican whip team, the group responsible for vote counting, Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma broke with the rest of the leadership and said the party should join with President Obama for now, Republican aides said. The meeting was first reported by Politico. 
"The first thing I'd do is make sure we don't raise taxes on 98 percent of the American people," he said in an interview Tuesday night. "We'll get some credit for that, and it's the right thing to do."
The break came after senior Democrats hardened their line on conditions for a deal to head off the automatic spending cuts and tax increases set to kick in this January. Democrats said Tuesday that Mr. Obama would not accept any deficit reduction deal that did not include a long-term extension of the debt ceiling, possibly ensuring that Mr. Obama would not have to deal with another debilitating fiscal showdown for the remainder of his presidency.
Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, and Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat, both said they did not intend to complete a major deficit reduction deal only to have Republicans reopen it each time the government bumped up against its statutory borrowing limit.
''We would be somewhat foolish to work on something on stopping us from going over the cliff, and a month or six weeks later, the Republicans pull the same thing they did before and say, 'We're not going to do anything unless this happens or we don't increase the debt ceiling,' '' Mr. Reid said. ''I agree with the president. It has to be a package deal.''
The stern posture may throw another roadblock in the way of a deal before January, when hundreds of billions of dollars in automatic spending cuts and tax increases kick in, possibly sending the economy back into recession. Conservative Republicans have said they want the debt ceiling left out of any deal to maintain leverage on Washington to keep trimming the deficit.
But the position taken by Mr. Cole suggested Republicans could be softening. An extension of the middle-class tax cuts would significantly diminish, or erase, any leverage Republicans might have to preserve tax cuts for more affluent households and some small businesses. But the leadership's political position will grow even more tenuous if prominent Republicans like Mr. Cole say it is time for a quick deal that would preserve the tax breaks of 98 percent of households and 97 percent of small businesses.
"I don't believe in holding the American people hostage to this debate," Mr. Cole said. "Let's get what we can now, then go back and try to get the rest. Where there is common ground with the president, we should seize that common ground."
Democrats on Tuesday laid out a series of demands that either showed confidence in the flexibility of defeated Republicans or indicated a brewing stalemate. Senator Max Baucus of Montana, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, flatly rejected a Republican proposal to cap tax deductions and credits at $25,000 a household instead of allowing tax rates to rise.
''I just want to point out a $25,000 cap will mean about a quarter of those who will pay more taxes will not be wealthy Americans but middle-income Americans,'' Mr. Baucus said. ''When that's fully understood I think the interest in that is going to wane.''
Mr. Durbin said the president would also demand a guarantee that the spending caps in any deal be adhered to and not reopened. Last year, Congress and the president agreed to 10 years of domestic spending caps as part of the deal to raise the debt ceiling, only to see House Republicans try to impose lower spending levels six months later.
Democrats said they would not accept cuts to Medicare or Medicaid as part of the upfront ''down payment'' on deficit reduction that would be passed next month along with a broader framework on tax and entitlement changes to be worked over in 2013.
In a speech at the liberal Center for American Progress, Mr. Durbin still expressed confidence that beneath all the public posturing, the White House and Speaker John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, were making progress toward averting the so-called fiscal cliff.
Mr. Durbin's speech itself was a measure of conciliation, laying out the case to liberals for a major deficit deal. He made clear that the parties agreed on what a final deal would look like: an initial deficit-reduction down payment to calm financial markets and avoid most of the fiscal jolt that would otherwise hit in January; instructions to Congressional committees to draft tax, spending and entitlement legislation to save around $4 trillion over the next decade; and some form of fallback deficit plan in case Congress fails to pass those changes.
Mr. Durbin said that Medicare should not be tapped for that upfront down payment but that federal health care programs should be part of next year's deliberations. And he opened the door for money-saving adjustments to Mr. Obama's signature health care law, so long as it was not gutted or repealed.
The Democrats' firm position on the debt ceiling was expected by Republican leaders, who went through a near-crisis in 2011 when House conservatives refused to raise the borrowing limit, nearly sending the federal government into default. The government will reach its borrowing limit again early next year. Kevin Smith, a spokesman for Mr. Boehner, said that regardless of how that looming deadline was dealt with, the speaker would insist on his own rule: any increase in the debt ceiling must be accompanied by spending cuts of at least the same magnitude.

HEADLINE: My Secretary Of State

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
President Obama is assembling his new national security team, with Senator John Kerry possibly heading for the Pentagon and U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice the perceived front-runner to become secretary of state. Kerry is an excellent choice for defense. I don't know Rice at all, so I have no opinion on her fitness for the job, but I think the contrived flap over her Libya comments certainly shouldn't disqualify her. That said, my own nominee for secretary of state would be the current education secretary, Arne Duncan.
Yes, yes, I know. Duncan is not seeking the job and is not the least bit likely to be appointed. But I'm nominating him because I think this is an important time to ask the question of not just who should be secretary of state, but what should the secretary of state be in the 21st century? 
Let's start with the obvious. A big part of the job is negotiating. Well, anyone who has negotiated with the Chicago Teachers Union, as Duncan did when he was superintendent of the Chicago Public Schools before going to Washington, would find negotiating with the Russians and Chinese a day at the beach. A big part of being secretary of education (and secretary of state) is getting allies and adversaries to agree on things they normally wouldn't -- and making them think that it was all their idea. Trust me, if you can cut such deals with Randi Weingarten, who is president of the American Federation of Teachers, you can do them with Vladimir Putin and Bibi Netanyahu.
A big part of the job of secretary of state is also finding common ground between multiple constituencies: Congress, foreign countries, big business, the White House, the Pentagon and the diplomats. The same is true for a school superintendent, but the constituencies between which they have to forge common ground are so much more intimidating: They're called ''parents,'' ''teachers,'' ''students'' and ''school boards.''
There is a deeper point here: The biggest issue in the world today is growth, and, in this information age, improving educational outcomes for more young people is now the most important lever for increasing economic growth and narrowing income inequality. In other words, education is now the key to sustainable power. To have a secretary of state who is one of the world's leading authorities on education, well, everyone would want to talk to him. For instance, it would be very helpful to have a secretary of state who can start a negotiating session with Hamas leaders (if we ever talk with them) by asking: ''Do you know how far behind your kids are?'' That might actually work better than: ''Why don't you recognize Israel?''
''The biggest issue in the world today is growth, and the world is divided into two groups -- those who get it and those who don't,'' said Michael Mandelbaum, the Johns Hopkins University foreign policy expert. ''If you're dealing with the Middle East, it might actually be helpful to have someone who can tell some of the parties why they are going in the wrong direction and how their problems are not what they think they are, nor are their solutions.''
Indeed, Islam is one of the world's great monotheistic faiths, but it is not the answer to Arab development today. Math is the answer. Education is the answer. Getting the Middle East to focus on that would do more to further our interests and their prosperity than anything else. As we are seeing in Egypt, suddenly creating a mass democracy without improving mass education is highly unstable.
At the same time, as our foreign budget shrinks, more and more of it will have to be converted from traditional grants to ''Races to the Top,'' which Duncan's Education Department pioneered in U.S. school reform. We will have to tell needy countries that whoever comes up with the best ideas for educating their young women and girls or incentivizing start-ups or strengthening their rule of law will get our scarce foreign aid dollars. That race is the future of foreign aid.
Finally, there's a reason that since the end of the cold war our secretaries of state have racked up more miles than they've made history. Before 1995, the job involved ending or avoiding superpower conflicts and signing big arms control treaties. Those were the stuff of heroic diplomacy. Fortunately, today there are fewer big wars to end, and the big treaties now focus more on trade and the environment than nukes -- and they're very hard to achieve. Also, today's secretary of state has to deal with so many more failed or failing states. Secretary Hillary Clinton practically had to forge the Syrian opposition groups into a coherent collective, as a necessary precursor to persuading them to do the right things. Today, to make history as a secretary of state, you have to make the countries to deal with first.
In short, we're still indispensable, but the problems are much more intractable. Our allies are not what they used to be and neither are our enemies, who are less superpowers and more superempowered angry men and women. A lot of countries will need to go back to the blackboard, back to the basics of human capacity building, before they can partner with us on anything. So while we're not likely to shift our secretary of education to secretary of state, let's at least understand why it is not such a preposterous idea.

HEADLINE: Dispute Over Steel Maker in France Could Disrupt Effort to Lure Industry

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY and NICOLA CLARK

 BODY:
PARIS -- It has been only a month since the French government, concerned about the country's declining competitiveness, began its ''Say Oui to France'' advertising campaign to attract foreign investment. But ArcelorMittal, the Luxembourg-based company with Indian roots that is the world's biggest steel maker, has been hearing a distinctly harsher message.
''We don't want Mittal in France because they haven't respected France,'' the industry minister, Arnaud Montebourg, said in an interview published this week in the daily Les chos, unable to conceal his frustration over the company's plan to scale back one of its three major French factories and eliminate hundreds of jobs. He called for the ''temporary nationalization'' and resale of the steel plant, at Florange, in the eastern region of Lorraine. 
The ugly dispute pits the French state, in its traditional role as defender of industry, against a company that is trying to reduce capacity in line with the slowdown in the European economy and to cut its $23 billion of debt after Moody's cut its credit rating to junk. The company wants to close two mothballed blast furnaces at the Florange plant, cutting 629 jobs, while continuing to operate a part of the facility that processes steel for the car industry. Currently the facility as a whole employs 2,700 people. In all, ArcelorMittal employs about 20,000 people in France.
With unemployment hovering above 10 percent, the Socialist government of President Franois Hollande is desperate to avoid more layoffs by name-brand companies. Several big employers, including PSA Peugeot Citron, Air France and Sanofi, have announced big job cuts this year. But some analysts say that by taking such a strongly interventionist stand to protect steel workers, France risks sending the wrong signal to multinational companies, whose investment the economy needs if it is to stave off long-term decline.
Mr. Hollande and Lakshmi Mittal, the Indian-born billionaire who serves as chairman and chief executive of ArcelorMittal, met Tuesday evening at the lyse Palace in Paris, but did not resolve the dispute.
Afterward, Mr. Hollande's office issued a communiqu saying the president had ''reaffirmed his desire to insure the sustainability of jobs at the site and presented the different possible options.'' The statement said the discussions would continue.
Giles Read, a spokesman for ArcelorMittal, also said the discussions would continue, but declined to comment further.
To promote France as a destination for foreign investors, the government recently hired the French advertising giant Publicis to create the international ''Say Oui to France'' campaign, which is running in the United States, Canada, China, India and Brazil.
A glossy brochure notes proudly that France is already home to 20,000 foreign companies and as recently as last year was the leading destination for corporate foreign investment. ''Our objective is to leverage France's attractiveness to remain a key investment destination in Europe,'' the brochure says.
But in fact, France is hemorrhaging industrial jobs to such an extent -- 750,000 in the past decade -- that in a government-commissioned report made public this month, Louis Gallois, a prominent businessman, called for ''a competitiveness shock'' to stanch the bleeding.
That is why critics say Mr. Montebourg's hard line against ArcelorMittal is the wrong message at the wrong time.
''The image France is projecting is disastrous,'' said Nina Mitz, a public relations consultant in Paris with deep ties to past Socialist governments in France. While she conceded the Florange factory case presented a political thicket for the Hollande government, Ms. Mitz said such bold talk of nationalization -- even if served up mainly for domestic consumption -- ''sends a frightening message, particularly to investors from other countries.''
The government's stance has invited ridicule from some opportunistic critics. Boris Johnson, the outspoken mayor of London, alluded to the Montebourg threat on Tuesday, telling Indian business leaders they should not ''wait to be persecuted by the sans-culottes in Paris,'' but should rather bring their business to London.
Mr. Montebourg has since moderated his remarks, saying his objection was to ''Mittal's methods,'' which he described as ''failure to keep promises, blackmail and threats.''
ArcelorMittal has agreed to give the government until Saturday to find a buyer for the furnaces, offering it for a symbolic single euro, despite skepticism that a buyer would be interested in anything less than the entire factory. Indeed, Mr. Montebourg now insists that the company agree to sell the entire plant. He says that two companies are interested, but has declined to identify them.
Mr. Mittal, who built ArcelorMittal from the 2006 merger of his Mittal Steel with Arcelor, then the largest European steel maker, promised at the time to help modernize the European steel sector, but the company says that the Florange facility was already slated for closure under Arcelor, its previous owner. This week he has countered the Montebourg threat with a warning of his own, saying in a statement that any sale of the entire Florange plant ''would jeopardize the viability'' of the rest of ArcelorMittal's operations in France.
Initially dismissed as rhetorical arm-twisting by Mr. Hollande's Socialist government, Mr. Montebourg's talk of nationalization has now garnered support from across the French political spectrum. On Tuesday, Henri Guaino, a close political associate of Mr. Hollande's predecessor, Nicolas Sarkozy, revealed in an interview with the business newspaper Les chos that Mr. Sarkozy had himself grappled with the question of whether to temporarily nationalize another ArcelorMittal facility, in the eastern city of Gandrange, in 2008.
The Sarkozy government ultimately failed to find a suitable private investor to take over the Gandrange plant and ArcelorMittal closed the site a year later, resulting in the loss of nearly 600 jobs -- and no small amount of political face for Mr. Sarkozy.
In the interview, Mr. Guaino said the steel maker had acted in bad faith, adding: ''One can ask the question of whether we were right to have trusted Mittal.''
There are precedents for nationalization, including the late Socialist President Franois Mitterrand's takeover of most of the banking sector in 1982, fulfilling a longstanding Socialist policy goal, and analysts said there was no legal impediment to such a move.
Asked in 2011, as ArcelorMittal was discussing the closure of a plant in Lige, Belgium, if European Union treaties prohibited nationalization, the European competition commissioner, Joaqun Almunia, said that the rules required only that the state act as a private enterprise would in the market, paying the owner the full value of the nationalized property and seeking to make a profit.
The most likely obstacles might be financial: At a time when France is raising taxes and freezing spending to meet budget targets, an open-ended commitment to a potential financial sinkhole would seem to be a risky proposition.
Whatever the outcome of the dispute over Florange, no one doubts the gravity of the problems faced by ArcelorMittal. Since the company's creation in the easy-credit days of 2006, it has been beset by the financial crisis and now the current slump in Europe. Its steel shipments fell 8.3 percent in the third quarter of this year from the previous three months, and it reported an operating loss of &#x20ac;643 million for the first nine months of 2012.
Analysts do not expect any significant improvement in European steel demand before 2014.
ArcelorMittal, which accounts for about 6 percent of world steel production, is trying to return to profitability by shutting down excess capacity. The Florange site, it argues, is too far from sea transport and too costly to supply under current conditions.
The company says it would supply slab steel from its plant in Dunkirk, on the English Channel, for processing at Florange.
Workers at the Dunkirk plant, for their part, are already complaining that one of the plant's three blast furnaces has been shut down longer than the company had said, and expressing concern that what happened to Florange will be their lot next.
''The state can't remain indifferent to the loss of the steel industry,'' Mr. Guaino said in the newspaper interview. ''It's a strategic sector where we have a considerable technological advantage.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: A New Leader Pushes a Different Side of Mexico

BYLINE: By ELISABETH MALKIN and RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD; Elisabeth Malkin reported from Quertaro, and Randal C. Archibold from Mexico City. Ginger Thompson contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
QUERTARO, Mexico -- They came looking for Andrs Cobos Marn, 22, with promises of financial security, a leg up over his peers, the life of his dreams.
But these were not the sort of recruiters who have made Mexico infamous, scouting hired guns and drug couriers for the criminal underworld. Quite the contrary, they were out hunting for talented young engineers with a knack for designing turbines and the like for this city's growing aerospace industry.
''The companies are looking for us; we don't have to go looking for them,'' said Mr. Cobos, who starts work in January at a Spanish company even before he graduates next year.
It is the flip side of the Mexico that the world is familiar with: the one in which drug barons hang bodies from bridges, evade the law in elaborate hideaways and funnel billions of dollars in narcotics across the border and around the world. 
In this other Mexico, taking hold in several pockets of the country like this one, high-skilled jobs are plentiful, industrial plants churn out increasingly sophisticated products and families adopt shades of middle-class life, with flat-screen televisions, new cars and homes a cut or more above those of their parents.
This more prosperous, parallel universe is what Mexico's president-elect, Enrique Pea Nieto, highlighted when he met with President Obama on Tuesday as he seeks to shift relations with the United States toward improving the economy and loosening up trade.
Mr. Pea Nieto, who takes office on Saturday, discussed a range of issues with Mr. Obama, including negotiations on Mexico's role in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade agreement being worked out among Asian and Western Hemisphere nations.
Mr. Pea Nieto's advisers are careful to say that they will continue to work closely with the United States on fighting drugs and organized crime, and he has promised Mexicans that he will reduce drug violence.
But Mr. Pea Nieto, who visits Canada on Wednesday, has made it clear that Mexico's poor image abroad has slowed its growth. His team plans a strong push to ''modernize'' trade deals, speed up or add new crossings at the border for commerce, court foreign investment to take advantage of vast, newly discovered shale gas fields near the United States border and generate more quality jobs like the ones here in Quertaro.
''In the next years, the great challenge is to succeed in making these kinds of examples multiply very quickly,'' Mr. Pea Nieto said this month.
Mexico fell into a deep recession in 2009 when American demand for Mexican-made imports collapsed. But the recovery under President Felipe Caldern has been notable, with growth expected to reach almost 4 percent this year, roughly twice that of the United States.
While Brazil is often thought of as Latin America's economic marvel, Mexico's economy outpaced Brazil's last year and is expected to do so again this year. Business that had fled Mexico in favor of China has started to return, as the wage gap narrows and transportation and other costs rise. Auto manufacturing, for instance, is surging, with several new plants.
The Obama administration is not expected to let up on its security concerns -- almost all of the administration members greeting Mr. Pea Nieto were from the security and foreign policy teams -- but economic changes have already altered the relationship between the two nations in some concrete ways. Better opportunities for Mexicans at home, not just the flagging United States economy and stricter enforcement at the border, contributed to a significant slowdown in illegal immigration north in recent years.
A senior Obama administration official said Mr. Pea Nieto's team made it clear from the start of talks after the July election that it would emphasize economic progress. But, the official said, ''there will also clearly be things that we will want to see Mexico do, like accelerate judicial reforms, like being as open and as forward-leaning as possible on reducing human rights abuses when they occur, like ensuring that they do as much as they say they are going to do on corruption issues.''
Still, analysts suggested that Mexico's president-elect was wise to play up a safer theme.
''The way to change the narrative is not to say, 'Security is not as bad as it seems,' '' said Christopher Wilson, a scholar at the Mexico Institute of the Woodrow Wilson International Center in Washington. ''The way to change the narrative is to talk about other things that are going well, and the economy is a good story now.''
Still, Mexico is far from realizing the middle-class society envisioned nearly two decades ago when it signed the North American Free Trade Agreement with the United States and Canada.
A recent World Bank report on the expanding middle class in Latin America noted that although an additional 17 percent of the Mexican population had entered the middle class since 2000, class mobility was still low. Almost 30 percent of Mexican workers toil in the informal economy, without any benefits or protection, for employers who pay no taxes.
Mr. Pea Nieto insists that he wants to push forward with a number of long-stalled economic measures -- several blocked in recent years by his own party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party -- that experts say choke Mexico's productivity. He has promised to rewrite the tax laws, open the state-owned oil sector to private investment and rein in Mexico's powerful monopolies.
His party, moreover, agreed to sweeping changes to the labor code this month that analysts say could pave the way for formalizing thousands of jobs.
''With structural reforms we can do much more; the growth rate could go up by several percentage points,'' said Gabriela Hernndez, the president and chief executive of General Electric Mexico, which is building a campus in Quertaro that will eventually house 1,800 engineers.
In this city of about a million people, where highways lined with steakhouses and multiscreen theaters streak toward new hillside housing developments, there is confidence that Quertaro's good run is just beginning. It has certain advantages, being off primary drug smuggling routes from Central and South America but on a main highway from Mexico City to the Texas border. People fleeing crime and congestion in Mexico City have flocked here, giving the state, also named Quertaro, a pool of well-educated workers.
In the past decade, the state has emerged as one of the safest places in Mexico and an industrial powerhouse for appliances, auto parts and now aerospace, which alone has attracted more than $1 billion in investments as multinationals like Bombardier Inc. build new factories.
''We have identified what our vocation is,'' said Marcelo Lpez, who has spent a decade working to attract companies to Quertaro as the state's undersecretary for economic development. ''Our strength is industry.''
Those industrial jobs have pushed Quertaro's growth and raised salaries to among the highest in Mexico.
With labor and transportation costs rising for production in Asia, ''a lot of manufacturers are saying, 'How can we do this differently?' '' said Pierre Beaudoin, the chief executive of Bombardier. ''You have got states today recognizing this in Mexico.''
When Bombardier decided to develop its new Learjet 85 corporate aircraft, it spread manufacturing across Canada, the United States and Mexico, shipping parts from all three countries for final assembly in Wichita, Kan. Several Mexican states competed for this country's piece, but Quertaro's proposal, which included a plan to attract other aerospace suppliers to a new industrial park, as well as a training school, won. Now the company is speeding up new investments here.
Its Learjet plant is deceptively quiet as young engineers in jeans run tests on a new fuselage built of lightweight composite carbon fiber. At another Bombardier plant, the rattle of bolting and welding runs along the line of tail pieces as workers install electrical and hydraulic systems before the pieces are shipped off for final assembly in Toronto.
So far, Mr. Pea Nieto has not offered specifics on how successes here can be replicated across Mexico; border cities with robust manufacturing still became some of the most violent places in Mexico because the police and judicial institutions were too weak to stop criminal groups.
Mr. Pea Nieto, analysts said, will need to focus on both economics and security.
''The picture the United States has of Mexico is old, and it's skewed toward the violence,'' said Robert A. Pastor, director of the Center for North American Studies at American University in Washington. The economy is growing, and ''if Pea Nieto can change the strategy on the cartels and reduce the violence, it will grow even faster.''

HEADLINE: Mideast Shift: Sunnis Gain

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR

 BODY:
RAMALLAH, West Bank -- For years, the United States and its Middle East allies were challenged by the rising might of the so-called Shiite crescent, a political and ideological alliance backed by Iran that linked regional actors deeply hostile to Israel and the West.
But uprising, wars and economics have altered the landscape of the region, paving the way for a new axis to emerge, one led by a Sunni Muslim alliance of Egypt, Qatar and Turkey. That triumvirate played a leading role in helping end the eight-day conflict between Israel and Gaza, in large part by embracing Hamas and luring it further away from the Iran-Syria-Hezbollah fold, offering diplomatic clout and promises of hefty aid.
For the United States and Israel, the shifting dynamics offer a chance to isolate a resurgent Iran, limit its access to the Arab world and make it harder for Tehran to arm its agents on Israel's border. But the gains are also tempered, because while these Sunni leaders are willing to work with Washington, unlike the mullahs in Tehran, they also promote a radical religious-based ideology that has fueled anti-Western sentiment around the region. 
Hamas -- which received missiles from Iran that reached Israel's northern cities -- broke with the Iranian axis last winter, openly backing the rebellion against the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad. But its affinity with the Egypt-Qatar-Turkey axis came to fruition this fall.
''That camp has more assets that it can share than Iran -- politically, diplomatically, materially,'' said Robert Malley, the Middle East program director for the International Crisis Group. ''The Muslim Brotherhood is their world much more so than Iran.''
The Gaza conflict helps illustrate how Middle Eastern alliances have evolved since the Islamist wave that toppled one government after another beginning in January 2011. Iran had no interest in a cease-fire, while Egypt, Qatar and Turkey did.
But it is the fight for Syria that is the defining struggle in this revived Sunni-Shiite duel. The winner gains a prized strategic crossroads.
For now, it appears that that tide is shifting against Iran, there too, and that it might well lose its main Arab partner, Syria. The Sunni-led opposition appears in recent days to have made significant inroads against the government, threatening the Assad family's dynastic rule of 40 years and its long alliance with Iran. If Mr. Assad falls, that would render Iran and Hezbollah, which is based in Lebanon, isolated as a Shiite Muslim alliance in an ever more sectarian Middle East, no longer enjoying a special street credibility as what Damascus always tried to sell as ''the beating heart of Arab resistance.''
If the shifts seem to leave the United States somewhat dazed, it is because what will emerge from all the ferment remains obscure.
Clearly the old leaders Washington relied on to enforce its will, like President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, are gone or at least eclipsed. But otherwise confusion reigns in terms of knowing how to deal with this new paradigm, one that could well create societies infused with religious ideology that Americans find difficult to accept. The new reality could be a weaker Iran, but a far more religiously conservative Middle East that is less beholden to the United States.
Already, Islamists have been empowered in Egypt, Libya and Tunisia, while Syria's opposition is being led by Sunni insurgents, including a growing number identified as jihadists, some identified as sympathizing with Al Qaeda. Qatar, which hosts a major United States military base, also helps finance Islamists all around the region.
In Egypt, President Mohamed Morsi resigned as a member of the Muslim Brotherhood only when he became head of state, but he still remains closely linked with the movement. Turkey, the model for many of them, has kept strong relations with Washington while diminishing the authority of generals who were longstanding American allies.
''The United States is part of a landscape that has shifted so dramatically,'' said Mr. Malley of the International Crisis Group. ''It is caught between the displacement of the old moderate-radical divide by one that is defined by confessional and sectarian loyalty.''
The emerging Sunni axis has put not only Shiites at a disadvantage, but also the old school leaders who once allied themselves with Washington.
The old guard members in the Palestinian Authority are struggling to remain relevant at a time when their failed 20-year quest to end the Israeli occupation of Palestinian lands makes them seem both anachronistic and obsolete.
''Hamas has always argued that it is the future of the changes in the region because of its revolutionary nature, that it is part of the religious political groups who have been winning the revolutions,'' said Ghassan Khatib, an official at Birzeit University and former government spokesman.
The Palestinian Authority's leader, Mahmoud Abbas, will address the United Nations General Assembly on Thursday to request that it recognize Palestine as a nonmember state. The resolution is expected to pass, but analysts view it as too little, too late in the face of the new regional mood.
At a busy Ramallah bakery, that mood was readily evident.
''If this situation continues, so what if Abu Mazen gets recognition, so what?'' said Salah Abdel Hamad, 50, a teacher, referring to Mr. Abbas. ''It will not bring any substantial change.''
The bakery's owner dared hang in the window a mourning poster for Ahmed al-Jabari, the Hamas military chief whose assassination by Israel helped to set off the latest conflict.
''The resistance,'' said Tha'er al-Baw, 23, referring to Hamas, ''proved that they are much better than the negotiating camp. In the days of Arafat, we used to think peace could be achieved through negotiations, but nobody believes this now.''
Even before the conflict, the emir of Qatar visited Gaza, promising $400 million in aid. Qatar did not donate that sum just to have its investment bombed to smithereens every few years.
As Egypt's president, Mr. Mubarak, who reviled the Muslim Brotherhood, was basically content to have Israel periodically smash Hamas, effectively the Brotherhood's Gaza cousin.
Mr. Morsi changed little from Mr. Mubarak's playbook, though his tone shifted. He sent his prime minister to lift morale. Ten foreign ministers, including those of Turkey and the newly Islamist government in Tunisia, also part of the new axis, visited Gaza during the fighting.
Egypt, Qatar and Turkey all want a more quiet, stable Middle East, which they have said repeatedly requires an end to the Israeli occupation. But the new Islamist governments do not talk about a two-state solution much, so analysts believe some manner of long-term truce is more likely.
''As Hamas moves closer to Turkey, Egypt and Qatar, it will be weaker as a 'resistance' movement because those three countries do not want a resistance movement,'' said Talal Atrissi, a Lebanese academic specializing in Arab-Iranian relations.
Those countries will not supply arms, however, so Hamas will maintain contacts with Tehran. Khaled Meshal, the Hamas leader, told CNN that ties are ''not as it used to be in the past, but there is no severing of relations.''
Where Hamas and Hezbollah were once allies, the fact that they are now at times at loggerheads illustrates the shift to the new Sunni axis.
A Western diplomat seeking to explain the changes recently drew a cross through the region, the meeting point representing Syria. Along the East-West line, he wrote ''febrile crescent,'' a play on the traditional ''Fertile Crescent'' used to describe the stretch of the Middle East where civilization began. The febrile crescent represents the volatile fault line between Sunnis and Shiites, with Syria the prize.
The other axis was labeled ''Sunni Struggles,'' representing the wrestling within the dominant Muslim sect over what governments and what ideology will emerge triumphant from the current political tumult. The deepest change, of course, is that the era of dictators seems to be closing.
''These are populist governments, which are much more attuned to the domestic public opinion than were previous regimes,'' said Rashid Khalidi, an Arab studies professor at Columbia University. ''Before the Arab revolutions you had a frozen situation where it was easy to see how things would go.''

HEADLINE: The Debate Over Tax Rates and Breaks

 BODY:
To the Editor:
According to ''Trying to Turn Obama Voters Into Tax Allies'' (news article, Nov. 26), I should expect an e-mail from one of President Obama's strategists asking me to support his efforts to secure Congressional approval of tax increases on the wealthy.
Unless such pleas are coupled with clear opposition to Republican proposals to cut the benefits of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps and social programs like Operation Headstart, I do not believe that the president's tax argument will garner the support he envisions. 
My response to the expected e-mail will be that a bargain that accepts the proposed cuts in social programs in return for grudging agreement to raise some taxes will hurt our country. I would rather have no deal than a bad one.

Re ''Norquist Says Some Republicans Are Having 'Impure Thoughts' on Taxes'' (The Caucus, nytimes.com, Nov. 26):
While Grover Norquist may not see the writing on the wall, it is clear that members of the Republican Party believe that his anti-tax orthodoxy has outlived its electoral usefulness, and they are beginning to push back on the restrictiveness of his interpretation of his pledge. Instead of childishly berating members of Congress for having ''impure thoughts,'' Mr. Norquist needs to figure out if he wants to become part of the solution or continue to be part of the problem.

Re ''A Minimum Tax for the Wealthy'' (Op-Ed, Nov. 26):
While Warren E. Buffett makes a compelling moral case for higher taxes on the wealthiest Americans, both he and President Obama seem to ignore the fact that the ''Buffett Rule'' would have a negligible impact on the deficit. Without a plan to tackle entitlement and defense spending, taxing the rich is a political gimmick, not an economic strategy.
BEN PETIT Washington, Nov. 27, 2012
To the Editor:
May I add a point to Warren E. Buffett's sensible advice? In addition to its other social and economic benefits, a higher tax rate on the wealthy (as he defines them) increases the incentive for donation to worthy institutions and causes, while decreasing the temptation of conspicuous consumption.
MOSS ROBERTS New York, Nov. 26, 2012
To the Editor:
Re ''Tax Talks Raise Bar for the Richest'' (front page, Nov. 20):
The simplest and fairest way to raise revenue from the truly wealthy without overtaxing the upper middle class should start not with changes in marginal tax rates or deductions, but rather by treating all income equally. Tax capital gains adjusted for inflation at the same rate as earned income. Make dividends deductible to corporations, but taxable to the individual as regular income.
Those two simple changes will raise revenue in a manner that is fair, as the richest will pay a percentage that is at least equal to that paid by those who are just well off. Additionally, it would reward patient capital, save billions on accounting fees, solve the problem related to carried interest and allow American corporations to repatriate more than a trillion dollars in cash from abroad without paying taxes simply by raising their dividends. If more revenue is still needed, then we can consider fiddling with deductions.
DANIEL BRONHEIM Kings Point, N.Y., Nov. 22, 2012
To the Editor:
Re ''To Reduce Inequality, Tax Wealth, Not Income,'' by Daniel Altman (Op-Ed, Nov. 19):
While widening income inequality and growing national deficits are matters of concern, Mr. Altman's proposed wealth tax is the wrong solution. Why institute a tax that discourages saving, even for high earners? If such a tax were introduced, I might as well move to a larger house, buy a fancier car and take a few extra expensive vacations each year.
If you really want to raise revenue fairly, then equalize taxes on earned and unearned income, and institute a tax on excessive consumption. Don't penalize my sensible and frugal lifestyle.

HEADLINE: A Time for More Nations

BYLINE: CASEY B. MULLIGAN


HIGHLIGHT: Economic theory suggests new nations will form as the world's economics and demography change, and the stirrings for Catalan independence may offer lessons for other countries, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Casey B. Mulligan is an economics professor at the University of Chicago. He is the author of "The Redistribution Recession: How Labor Market Distortions Contracted the Economy." 
Catalonia, which includes Barcelona, has long been a part of Spain, but its peaceful residents increasingly talk about being an independent country again. In elections over the weekend, where independence was one of the most discussed campaign issues, a majority of offices were won by parties that support more Catalan independence, in one form or another.
An independent Catalonia would reinforce a worldwide trend. The world's economics and demography are changing, and economic theory predicts that national borders will change with them (see "The Size of Nations," by Alberto Alesina and Enrico Spolaore or "A Theory of the Size and Shape of Nations," by David Friedman in The Journal of Political Economy ). 
The number of countries has grown since World War II, especially since 1990. The Soviet Union broke into multiple nations. Czechoslovakia split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia; Yugoslavia dissolved. 
In most cases, many citizens of the parts wanted independence from the larger whole. The large countries were often divided by language or ethnicity and were often held together by nondemocratic leadership. The new independent countries emerged as democracy took hold, or shortly after. 
In a few instances, countries combined. East Germany and West Germany unified. North and South Vietnam became one when North Vietnam won the Vietnam War. North Yemen and South Yemen were unified. As their names suggest, they have some common language, culture and history, more so than many former Soviet republics did.
Catalonia has its own language, Catalan, and a long history. Under Franco, Spain suppressed many Catalan institutions. And labor was mobile in Spain during the Franco regime, with many Spanish-speakers moving to Catalonia, Spain's most prosperous region. The prevalence of Spanish in Catalonia, as well as the heavy hand of Franco, may have undercut an independence movement. But Franco's death in 1975 and the emergence of democracy in Spain did not foster an independent Catalonia. 
New generations have been learning Catalan, however, and that may be tipping the balance toward independence.
Catalonia objects to the amount of taxes it pays Spain's central government, compared with the benefits it receives. One potential step would be to address that situation without full independence, by having Spain's central government "charge" Catalonia less for being part of Spain by providing tax breaks or more public services.
As governments and redistribution grow, richer regions find taxes to be increasingly burdensome. With the cold war over, ethnically unique regions no longer perceive the same national security benefits of being part of a larger nation. 
Catalonia's situation is worth watching, as it may hold lessons for Libya, Iraq and even the United States, where regions sometimes diverge in terms of culture, language and preferences for governing. A small nation can be established peacefully and may prove to have long-term benefits.

HEADLINE: An 'Unsexy' Start-Up Tries to Fill Movie Seats

BYLINE: JESSICA BRUDER


HIGHLIGHT: Dealflicks, says one of its founders, wants to do for movie tickets what Priceline.com and Hotwire.com do for travel bookings. 

 BODY:
Sean Wycliffe knew "The King's Speech" had gotten rave reviews. So when he arrived at the theater about two years ago, he was surprised by what he saw. "It was a great movie, but the place was just empty," he said. "It had 230 or 240 seats, but there was me and a couple and that was it."
Mr. Wycliffe had just completed his bachelor's degree in economics at the University of California, Berkeley. Midway through, he'd taken time off to start a small marketing firm with his brother. Now he hankered to build something new. 
He found himself thinking about Hotwire and Priceline, the discount sites he'd used for several years to book hotel rooms that would otherwise go unoccupied. "What if we could partner with theaters and help them fill their seats in the same way?" he wondered. Moviegoers would pay for discounted tickets, specifying the film, the approximate time of day and the neighborhood. After completing a purchase, they would learn the exact showtime and theater. 
Mr. Wycliffe incorporated Dealflicks last year. He started working full-time on the project in January along with two co-founders and they introduced a beta site in July.
 Co-Founders: Mr. Wycliffe, 29, is the chief executive officer. Kevin Hong, 27, is the vice president of sales, and Zachary Cancio, 25, the chief technology officer.
 Employees: Dealflicks has one full-time employee, a business development manager who started out as the company's summer intern. Two more - a designer and a software engineer - are expected to come onboard soon.
 Location: Dealflicks moved in October from Mr. Wycliffe's Oakland apartment to Mountain View, Calif.
 Pitch: "Dealflicks is like Priceline.com or Hotwire.com, but for movie theaters," Mr. Wycliffe said. "Right now about 88 percent of seats are empty on average. We partner with movie theaters and help them do marketing to fill these empty seats. Our deals are usually tickets - or tickets and popcorn, tickets and soda, that kind of thing - at up to 60 percent off." From that discounted price, Dealflicks typically takes a 10-percent cut, though agreements vary by individual partners.
 Traction:Dealflicks has contracted with 62 movie theaters so far. First to sign on was the Gardena Cinema in Los Angeles County. Mr. Hong wooed its Korean owners by bringing them his mother's homemade pajun scallion pancakes.
While trying to build a primary base of theaters in the Bay Area, Dealflicks has also inked deals with partners in Arizona, Georgia, Massachusetts, New York, Ohio, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin.
This fall, Dealflicks won a slot in the accelerator run by 500 Startups, a seed fund and program for early-stage ventures created by Dave McClure, a former PayPal executive. The relationship developed after Mr. Wycliffe and his co-founders attended Unsexy, a conference for companies that are promising but unlikely to set pulses racing in Silicon Valley. At the conference, they talked to every 500 Startups alumni they could find.
"Then when walking out of an auditorium, we literally stumbled upon some dude coding on the floor. That dude turned out to be the C.T.O. of LivingSocial, Aaron Batalion," Mr. Cancio wrote on his blog. "But neither Sean nor I realized who he was at the time. Like a scout, I surreptitiously looked at his name badge. I muttered a quiet suggestion to Sean and before I knew it, Sean marched up to Aaron and introduced himself." That chance meeting wasn't all it took to get into the accelerator -- but it helped.
 Revenue: So far, Dealflicks has sold a couple of hundred tickets, according to Mr. Wycliffe, who said total revenue has not yet passed the single-digit thousands. "But the growth is there," he said. "This month, we've sold more than in the previous three months combined." The company issued its first paychecks on Nov. 15.
 Financing: Dealflicks has raised $115,000. Friends and family put in about $65,000. The remaining $50,000 came from 500 Startups. The company is seeking $250,000 in angel investments.
 Marketing: The company holds parties at college campuses to get the word out. ("Dealflicks just hooked us up with a keg!!!" one Berkley student announced on the company's Facebook page.) It also focused on search engine optimization, working to rank high in Google searches when users hunt for ticket deals. They've partnered with several larger sites that take a commission for driving sales their way. And they've also scored appearances on a couple of Bay Area television news affiliates.
 Competition: Movietickets.com and Fandango are the Goliaths of the online ticketing space. "They're great but they're different than what we do because they only sell full-price tickets, and they charge a convenience fee as well," Mr. Wycliffe said. Entrants in the discount space are more of a wild card; five or six of them have come and gone in the last couple of years, he said. One contender, MoviePass, offers unlimited theater trips for a monthly fee. (In a sector that loves analogies, it aims to be the "Netflix of movie theaters.")
Being "unsexy," Mr. Wycliffe believes, "is kind of good in a way, because in Silicon Valley, everyone's focused on that next, next thing. They're looking at video on-demand and social networks. Most are not focused on the movie theater industry."
 Challenge: Can Dealflicks convince a critical mass of cinemaphiles to trade their ability to pick an exact time and theater for a cheaper ticket? Building the customer base is essential to attracting more theaters that, in turn, could attract more customers.
"Eventually, we'll need to partner with some of the top chains to grow the business," Mr. Wycliffe said. "For now, it's about getting to the point where we have more and more theaters, and we're filling up all of these empty seats."

HEADLINE: The Power of Failure

BYLINE: SARIKA BANSAL


HIGHLIGHT: Taking a cue from Silicon Valley, nonprofits are learning to use their failures as an integral part of the process of innovation and, ultimately, progress. 

 BODY:
Seven years ago, the consulting group Bridgespan presented details on the performance of several prestigious nonprofits. Nearly all of them had one thing in common - failure. These organizations had a point at which they struggled financially, stalled on a project or experienced high rates of attrition. "Everyone in the room had the same response, which was relief," said Paul Schmitz, the chief executive of the nonprofit Public Allies. "It was good to see that I wasn't the only one struggling with these things."
As in any field, people who work in nonprofits, social enterprises, development agencies, and foundations experience failure on a regular basis. People make hiring and budgeting mistakes. Shipments arrive late, or not at all. Organizations allow their missions to drift. Technologies prove inappropriate for the communities meant to benefit from them.
"We are working in some of the most difficult places in the world," said Wayan Vota, a technology and information expert who organized the third annual FAILFaire conference two weeks ago in Washington. "But failure is literally the 'f-word' in development." The idea behind this FAILFaire, which was hosted by the World Bank, was to highlight, even celebrate, instances of failure in the field of social change as an integral part of the process of innovation and, ultimately, progress. 
Some nonprofits are tempted to hide their failures, partially for fear of donor reaction. But most acknowledge that transparency about what works and what doesn't is crucial to their eventual success.
"Not talking about [failure] is the worst thing you can do, as it means you're not helping the rest of the organization learn from it," said Jill Vialet, who runs the nonprofit Playworks. "It gives [the failure] a power and a weight that's not only unnecessary, but damaging." Vialet instead supports failing "out loud" and "forward," meaning that the people involved in the failure should speak about it openly and work to prevent history from repeating itself.

This idea is already ingrained in the cultures of some for-profit industries. "In Silicon Valley, failure is a rite of passage," said Vota. "If you're not failing, you're not considered to be innovating enough." Silicon Valley investors, in turn, regularly reward entrepreneurs' risk-taking behavior, though they know the venture may fail and they will lose their capital.
"The ironic thing," said Schmitz of Public Allies, "is that you have donors who took major risks in their own fortunes, but are very risk averse when giving to charity. People rightly want their dollars to have the maximum impact, but don't apply the same logic model that they give to their private sector investment." As a result, he said, many social change groups innovate less often and less wildly.
Individuals within the social change community have recognized the value in emulating Silicon Valley's culture of calculated risk-taking, and are actively working to de-stigmatize failure. FAILFaire is one example. At the event, Aleem Walji, the director of the World Bank Institute's Innovation Labs, spoke of a failed collaboration with Google, in which the World Bank would have provided Google's Map Maker program to governments and multilaterals to help with disaster preparedness. However, development experts lambasted the World Bank for supporting Google's closed platform, which would not allow users free access to the map data they would create. A month after the partnership was announced, the bank changed course and announced its commitment to open-source mapping programs.
Walji said the lesson his team learned from the failed partnership was to "not get overly excited about the prospect of working with a big sexy company [like Google] before reading the fine print."
At the same event, Neelley Hicks of United Methodist Communications admitted that her organization spent limited resources flying people to Angola from the United States, when they could have found people within the country to do the same job. Other speakers spoke of ill-conceived partnerships, of unnecessary reports that spent their lives gathering dust, and of spending too much time building a Twitter presence.
Some organizations encourage employees to talk about failure in office events that are closed to the public. The World Bank is holding an internal FailFaire in December, which will be moderated by Jim Yong Kim, the bank's president. DoSomething.org, a nonprofit that supports social change among teenagers, holds a bi-annual Fail Fest conceived and hosted by its chief executive, Nancy Lublin.
Others publish their failures for the world to see. Engineers Without Borders Canada, which creates engineering solutions to international development problems, publishes a "failure report" every year alongside its annual report. "I only let the best failures into the report," said Ashley Good, its editor. The examples that are published, she said, show people who are "taking risks to be innovative."
Good also started a Web site, Admitting Failure, to encourage people working in international development to share their stories of failure. The site includes stories about arriving unprepared to an emergency medical situation in the Middle East, the theft of an expensive and underused water filter, and more.
One of the site's aims, said Good, is to create a "feedback loop" that does not currently exist in the development sector. In the private sector, she said, people know immediately whether a product is of value to customers. By contrast, "there are incentives [in the social change world] to not accept feedback, since your accountability is not to your beneficiaries but to your donors. N.G.O.s need to be able to say to donors, 'Don't fund this, it doesn't work.' "
For a failure to have a resounding impact on an organization and its future activities, several elements need to be in place. It is crucial to talk about failure aloud - and according to Vota, to have the "biggest hippo," or the most senior person, lead the charge. In addition to nurturing a culture of innovation and reflection, talking about failure helps build a canon of knowledge of what not to do in the future.
In addition, Jill Vialet of Playworks emphasizes the importance of "failing fast and cheap" (as opposed to slow and expensive). She sets aside a budget for new programs that intentionally have unpredictable outcomes. They limit the scope of these programs, clearly define failure and success at the outset, and decide when to measure the new program's merits. "It's about being disciplined and rigorous," said Vialet, since human nature normally prevents us from recognizing our mistakes while they are occurring.
Schmitz and several FAILFaire speakers also see the need to change the nature of donor relationships. Instead of trying to constantly dazzle funders, Schmitz recommends developing long-term relationships that allow for failure and growth. If a funder is invested in you, he said, he or she will share your sense of vulnerability if a project is not going as planned, and may sometimes help collectively problem solve.
Not all funders are looking for infallible investees. Talia Milgrom-Elcott, a program officer at the Carnegie Corporation of New York, says that when she evaluates a grant, she is more interested in whether the team can successfully deal with failure - "course correct" - than whether it will fail at all. "You want organizations [in your portfolio] to take calculated risks, you want them to think big," she said. "You want some that are taking big leaps, that are moving in a new direction."
Building a culture of openness to failure takes time and consistent effort. Unfortunately, efforts to normalize failure can be set back by cautionary tales of failures gone wrong. When the public learned in 2011 that the Global Fund that Fights AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria had mismanaged some funds, several countries froze their support. "The last thing people want to see is their tax dollars or donations being 'wasted' on failed projects that were not originally designed to help them in the first place," wrote Jessica Keralis on a global health blog.
In the majority of cases, however, failure in the social change world does not involve as many dollars or stakeholders, and admitting it can have a net positive impact on an organization. Doing so can build institutional knowledge and create a culture where people are more open to taking risks. Admitting failure can also signal to funders like Milgrom-Elcott that an organization is "unafraid to change and address the next problem."
Ultimately, said Good, her hope is to remove the negative connotation of failure and instead see it as an "indicator of innovation, and a driver of collaboration that's needed to catalyze systemic change." Only then can the social change world reach its true potential.

HEADLINE: Smith Electric's 3rd American Factory to Be in Chicago

BYLINE: JIM MOTAVALLI


HIGHLIGHT: "We truly feel a local presence will create demand," said Smith's chief executive, Bryan Hansel. 

 BODY:
Smith Electric Vehicles was originally a British company, making plug-in versions of what the English call "milk floats," but in early 2011 the American operation acquired the British parent. From its home manufacturing base in Kansas City, Mo., the company has steadily expanded. In late 2011, the company announced that it would build electric trucks in the Bronx. And on Wednesday, Smith will make public its plans for a third American factory - in Chicago.
Smith, which retains its operations in England, produces hundreds, not thousands, of trucks a year. It received $32 million under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, and its Kansas City factory got a visit from President Obama in 2010. 
Does it really need three factories in the United States? The factories are small, adding electric drive trains to chassis and cabs imported from Avia in the Czech Republic. The company says having regional service, sales and assembly operations helps meet the needs of local fleets. In New York, Smith's customers include the Duane Reade pharmacy chain, Coca-Cola, Frito-Lay, Down East Seafood and FreshDirect.
"We truly feel a local presence will create demand," said Bryan L. Hansel, Smith's chief executive, in a telephone interview. "The city of Chicago may not buy trucks from us if we we're not located there. And the beauty of our business model is that the shops don't need a lot of capital or overhead." Mr. Hansel didn't rule out creating additional factories in the United States. "If we see more opportunities, we will certainly continue this strategy," he said.
Smith's presence in the Chicago market will be enhanced by incentives the city announced on Tuesday. The Chicago Department of Transportation is beginning a $15 million program next spring to encourage area fleets to replace diesel delivery vehicles with electrics. Companies will be able to obtain point-of-sale vouchers to cover about 60 percent of the added cost of the electric truck over its diesel equivalent, with battery pack size a determining factor. The city is also planning off-peak delivery times for plug-in vehicles, "green zone" parking and registration benefits.
"Because of the incentive package, a lot of companies will want to purchase midsize commercial electric vehicles and put them on the streets here," said David Spielfogel, chief of policy and strategic planning for the Chicago mayor's office. "We've already had a lot of calls. This fits into the mayor's vision for electrifying the fleet."
Mr. Spielfogel said in a telephone interview that the city was working with Smith to identify a plant site, which will probably be an unoccupied city factory in a corridor chosen for redevelopment. He said the goal was to have a site identified by the end of the year, the factory ready in the first quarter of 2013, and vehicles rolling out in the second quarter. Mr. Hansel said the factory in the Bronx was ahead of the Chicago operation, and it could begin producing trucks early next year.
The Windy City has long been home to vehicle manufacturing. Ford's Chicago Assembly Plant was opened in 1924.

HEADLINE: Reading O'Neill in Rangoon

BYLINE: SWE WIN


HIGHLIGHT: Obama's visit to Myanmar may have been driven by economic and strategic interests first, but to people like me, who dreamed of America's ideals during years in prison, it also signaled my country's move out of the dark ages. 

 BODY:
YANGON - Thousands of Burmese took to the streets last week to greet and gawk at the first sitting U.S. president ever to visit the country.
For the politicians, it was a visit of mutual convenience. The leaders of Myanmar want to rebuild relations with the West, and Washington is easing sanctions against the country in the hope of increasing its presence in the Asia-Pacific region. Both governments are eager to offset China's influence.
For the people of Myanmar, the event marked a joyous moment: a chance to reconnect with the rest of the world, from which they were separated during decades of brutal military rule.

Many Burmese who came of age during World War II or the Cold War thought communism preferable to British colonialism. In 1962, U Ne Win, the revolutionary-turned-military dictator who seized power through a coup, promised to promote a Burmese Way to Socialism. Ostensibly a mixture of Buddhist ideas and socialist principles like the collectivization of property, this was in fact just a euphemism for military rule under a one-party system. 
Those who had been active in the anti-British movement knew better, and communism held purchase with them well into the 1960s and 1970s. The United States didn't help its case - nor those of capitalism and democracy - by entertaining cozy ties with many of the brutal military rulers of Southeast Asia, including Ne Win.
By the late 1980s, however, the Communist Party of Burma - which was led by former independence fighters - was losing steam against the military government, thanks to internal rivalries and decreased support from the Chinese government under Deng Xiaoping. And then the Soviet Union collapsed. That double defeat kept communist ideology from catching on with those of us who were born in the 1970s and later.
So I grew up feeling undivided admiration for the American political system. Even after 1988 - when the army crushed a nationwide democratic uprising and introduced a kleptocratic regime with no pretense at socialism - one would find on the sidewalks of Yangon heaps of secondhand books translated from Russian, including by Gorky. But very few of us would look at them anymore. We'd scramble instead for the odd American novel or go to the United States Information Center to teach ourselves to read English - most memorably, for me, with Eugene O'Neill's "Beyond the Horizon."
To us, it didn't matter that the Myanmar state media portrayed the United States as a mischievous world power, an intruder in the internal affairs of sovereign states. From within our military dictatorship, it was only too easy to relate to the bad news we occasionally did get about life in North Korea, Cuba and China.
By the time I was a university student, in the mid-1990s, many of my peers viewed the United States exactly as it wants to be viewed: a land of freedom. We'd even talk with envy about the fact that President Bill Clinton could be impeached for the Lewinsky affair. When in late 1998 I was jailed for participating in an antigovernment student protest, my political leanings were only confirmed.
The Myanmar state media did not report the news of Baghdad's fall to U.S. troops in the spring of 2003. Instead, it carried reports by China's state-run Xinhua agency claiming that the U.S. forces had been stopped by sandstorms on their march toward the capital. For the diehard dissidents I met in Myingyan Prison - many of whom still held admiring views of Marx, Lenin and Mao - the invasion of Iraq was evidence of the American menace.
But for me and many people in Myanmar, the fall of Saddam Hussein was an inspiration. It energized younger dissidents, for whom almost any action was justifiable in the name of regime change. Some of them actually toiled under such strong illusions that in 2006 and 2007 an American diplomat in Yangon would occasionally explain to them why U.S. troops would not be coming to Burma any time soon.
Today, many Myanmar youngsters are still passionate about the United States; the appeal of its political and educational systems endures. But now that my friends and I are in our mid-30s, our enthusiasm is milder. Some of our American dreams have passed us by.
One of my friends, also a former political prisoner, tried to leave Myanmar to study architecture in the United States in the early 2000s; he worshipped Frank Lloyd Wright. Because of his time in prison, though, he never could get a passport. Now he says he's more attracted to Chinese art.
Of course, some of us here believe that if the U.S. government is finally normalizing relations with Myanmar, it's partly out of greed for our natural resources and a desire to counter China's influence. My friends from Kachin State, in northern Myanmar, also grumble that during his recent visit Obama made only a few perfunctory comments about the continued armed clashes between government forces and the ethnic rebels of the region.
Yet Obama's visit is also a sure sign that Myanmar finally is moving out of the dark ages of brutal military rule. We may not get more jobs and educational opportunities any time soon, but already we have won the chance to be connected to the West, to democracy and last week - at last! - to a powerful American politician like Obama.
"We are gaining normalcy," a friend told me in relief the day after Obama left. "We knew that it was never normal to have good ties with Pyongyang and Beijing but not with the countries like the United States."

HEADLINE: Europe Divided Ahead of U.N. Palestinian Vote

BYLINE: HARVEY MORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: Differing opinions on how to advance the Middle East peace process will deny Europe a common voice on the General Assembly. They also highlight the difficulty of ever formulating a common European foreign policy. 

 BODY:
LONDON - Spain has followed France in announcing it will support a Palestinian bid for enhanced status at the United Nations when the issue goes to a vote of the General Assembly.
Within hours, however, Britain indicated on Wednesday that it would abstain unless the Palestinians met its conditions for a "yes" vote. 
After the announcementsfrom Paris and Madrid, the Palestinians could have been forgiven for spotting an emerging consensus among the Europeans in favor of its bid on Thursday to achieve recognition as a non-member observer state. 
But Britain's likely abstention served to underline the continuing divisions within Europe, some tactical and others fundamental, over how to advance the Mideast peace process. European governments remain almost equally divided over how to address the issue of upgrading Palestine's status. 
The United States has tried to persuade Palestinian leaders to not seek a vote in the General Assembly, and last year threatened to use its veto in the Security Council when Palestinians requested admissions as a member state. That proposal never came to a vote.
William Hague, the British foreign minister, said he was still prepared to vote in favor if he received assurances that the Palestinians would immediately return to the negotiating table with Israel and not attempt to use their enhanced U.N. status to pursue legal action against Israel for its conduct in the occupied territories. 
There is nothing quite like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for highlighting the difficulties of achieving a common foreign policy among the 27 members of the European Union.
The divisions were apparent in a vote late last year in which 11 European states voted to allow the Palestinians to join UNESCO, the U.N.'s cultural heritage body. Five countries were opposed and 11 abstained.
Announcing Spain's intention to support enhanced status for the Palestinians on Wednesday, Jos Manuel Garcia-Margallo, the foreign minister, said Madrid would have preferred that the European Union vote together.
"Up to the last second we have been working to achieve consensus among the 27 member states," he told Parliament. "It was not possible and we have had to take the unilateral option."
Pro-Israeli stalwarts such as the Netherlands have said in advance that they will not support the Palestinian bid. Frans Timmermans, the Dutch foreign minister, said it would not contribute to the peace process.
As long-term Middle East-watchers are fond of remarking, the peace process is sadly all process and no peace.
But the failure of a long run of now almost forgotten initiatives to achieve a lasting peace, and the lack of a common position among the Europeans, has not deterred the Continent's leaders from insisting on a central role in attempts to resolve the conflict.
The European Union is one quarter of the so-far largely ineffectual Middle East Quartet. Non-E.U. Norway oversaw the Oslo peace process, and the 1991 Middle East peace conference was held in Madrid.
Since then, Europe has become the major source of the funds that prop up the economy of the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories.
Following the latest round of Israeli raids against Gaza, the European taxpayer is likely to pick up much of the bill for putting the territory back together.
But, in spite of this diplomatic and financial commitment, Europe remains in, at best, a supporting role in the peace process amid occasional efforts to elbow its way to the front, as in the long-forgotten Venice Declaration of 1980.
The Palestinians have an interest in bringing Europe into the debate over issues such as U.N. status. On the broader issue of a comprehensive peace, Israel is insistent that only the United States is acceptable as the ultimate mediator.
Mr. Hague acknowledged the centrality of the United States when he told the British Parliament on Wednesday that he had urged Washington to launch a new peace initiative in the region.
Germany's Der Spiegel, writing in September ahead of the first statement by a president of the European Council to the U.N. General Assembly, correctly predicted that Herman van Rompuy would avoid any new policy on Israeli-Palestinian peace for fear of stirring up European divisions.
The omission, on a central issue before the world body, the German weekly wrote, "shows how at odds the Europeans remain on the Palestinian question."
Because of an error introduced in editing, an earlier version of this post stated that the United States had threatened to use its veto to prevent Palestinians from receiving enhanced status in the United Nations. The United States threatened to use its veto on the Security Council last year to scuttle a formal request by Palestinian leaders for full United Nations membership. That vote never came to the Security Council.

HEADLINE: How Children Subsidize 'Low, Low Prices'

BYLINE: KJ DELL'ANTONIA


HIGHLIGHT: Adolescents from households headed by a low-income worker are more likely to drop out of school, to be obese, and to take on adult roles too young. 

 BODY:
A significant part of our national antipoverty strategy over the past few decades has been increasing employment - moving people, particularly mothers, off "welfare rolls" and into jobs. But the types of jobs available to most lower-income parents, mothers and fathers alike, are low-wage jobs that present their own problems to those trying to support and raise a family. The lack of benefits, the inflexible hours and the often nonstandard shifts exacerbate the low pay and create a situation in which parents don't have the time they want and need to spend with their children or the money to find high-quality substitutes (like activities and child care) for that time.
The result, according to the Boston College sociologist Lisa Dodson and Randy Albelda, an economist at the University of Massachusetts, Boston, is thattheir parents' low-wage jobs put youth at risk. Adolescents from households headed by a low-income worker are more likely to drop out of school, to be obese and to take on adult roles too young. In providing child care for siblings and forgoing opportunities that require an engaged parent helping with homework or encouraging outside activities, teenage children in low-wage families are, Drs. Dodson and Albelda argue, "effectively subsidizing" their parents' employment as home health aides, janitors, food-service providers and retail clerks. 
That can't be what we hoped to achieve with welfare reform. "Policymakers tend to put things into what we call 'silos,'" Dr. Dodson said. "Jobs here. Kids there. Instead, we need to look at the ways these things affect each other. The structure of low-wage jobs creates a particular kind of obstacle for parents trying to take good care of their kids." And children thrust into their own care-giving roles are children who aren't easily able to develop the skills they need to do better than a low-wage job for themselves as adults. The low-wage job cycle becomes a vicious one.
"How," I asked her after I read the report, "is this anything except just depressing?" As economic struggles push people into low-wage jobs, their limited resources press retailers to keep prices low and affordable - and one way to do that, as American Public Media's Marketplace reported, is to create still more low-wage jobs, often temp jobs, that don't cost a company in benefits or demand steady pay for a worker in the off-season. With one in four workers in a low-wage job today, and low-wage work projected to account for two out of every three new jobs in the United States over the next decade, it's hard to see the constructive side of a report on how those same jobs are difficult not just for workers, but for their families, and even harder to see how we get out of either cycle.
"Well," she answered, "people are talking about it. We see efforts to get more flexibility in the workplace. We hope to get the folks who are interested in improving low-wage jobs to talk to the people concerned about youth, and the people talking about kids and the importance of parental involvement to understand what kind of jobs those parents have."
It's part of our cultural narrative to insist that parents are fully responsible for raising our children (despite our national need to "produce" another generation of healthy, well-educated adults capable of filling the jobs we now hold). But you don't have to favor subsidized day care or mandated child-care leaves for all to recognize that the forces that create and structure low-wage jobs are just one of the ways our society's choices actively make taking that responsibility more difficult. We choose, again and again, to ignore the very real needs of the significant proportion of the work force with children at home. The result, in the low-wage worker's world, is that job flexibility becomes the ability to quit one job and later find another, and many people describe themselves as being one sick kid away from unemployment.
"These families couldn't remain intact without the effort of young kids stepping into adult shoes," Dr. Dodson said, but without the chance to cultivate their own talents, many of these teenagers will find themselves playing out the low-wage job cycle with their own children. That's good for creating a nation of low-wage workers, and bad for the American tradition of helping each generation do better than the one before.

HEADLINE: John Boehner's Price

BYLINE: DAVID FIRESTONE


HIGHLIGHT: As the debt ceiling debate intensifies, John Boehner tries his hand at extortion. 

 BODY:
It's been clear for weeks that Republicans learned very little from the election, in which they lost their chance for the presidency, lost their dream of regaining a Senate majority, and lost seven seats in the House. But Speaker John Boehner has now made it clear he also learned nothing from the ugliest government debacle of the Tea Party era, in which Republicans threatened to default on the credit of the United States if they didn't get drastic cuts in spending. 
The debt-ceiling fight last year led to the downgrading of the government's credit rating, produced an automatic sequester of spending that everyone in Washington loathes, and reduced the popularity of Congress to single digits. When President Obama told Mr. Boehner he didn't want to go through all that again, asking that the debt ceiling be raised as part of the fiscal-cliff talks, Mr. Boehner had a familiar response, according to Politico:
"There is a price for everything."

In other words, the House will want additional spending cuts, on top of all the other ones being negotiated in the fiscal talks, as the price for raising the limit. And if that price is not met, the House will once again invite a ruinous default.
That would be an actual fiscal cliff, far more dangerous to the economy than the tax increases and spending cuts now under debate. But Mr. Boehner wants to preserve the threat, because, as he told the president, it's "my leverage."
The White House, along with top Congressional Democrats, have made it clear that they don't intend to play along, and want a long-term debt ceiling agreement reached in the fiscal cliff talks. But the extortion will still be present, and will never really go away until it is permanently defused.
This time, the president needs to go further than simply negotiating past it, and declare an end to the debt ceiling once and for all. He can do this, many legal scholars have argued, by citing the 14th Amendment's clause that the country's public debt shall not be questioned, a route that Nancy Pelosi and other Democrats are now urging him to take. The White House and Republicans would then have to fight out the issue in the courts.
Mr. Obama chose not to invoke the Constitution last year, but a second threat to pummel a wounded economy calls for a definitive response.

HEADLINE: Even in Their 80s, Brothers Behind the Camera

BYLINE: LARRY ROHTER


HIGHLIGHT: The Taviani brothers, now in their 80s, talk about their film "Caesar Must Die," Italy's entry for best foreign language film. 

 BODY:
In their long and distinguished careers, which began in Italy in the 1950s, the brothers Paolo and Vittorio Taviani have won many awards for the films they have directed together, including prizes at the Cannes Film Festival for "Padre Padrone" in 1977 and "The Night of the Shooting Stars" in 1982. One top prize, however, has eluded them: they have never won the Oscar for best foreign-language film.
But at an age when most directors and screenwriters have long retired - Paolo is 81 and Vittorio is 83 - the Taviani brothers are in the running this year with "Caesar Must Die," considered a surprising submission for Italy even though it had won honors at the Berlin Film Festival in February. Shot largely in black and white in a maximum security prison, "Caesar Must Die" has the look of a documentary, and focuses on a group of prisoners who rehearse and perform Shakespeare's "Julius Caesar" as they tell their own life stories. In New York this fall for the New York Film Festival, they discussed the genesis of the film and what it's like to work together for nearly 60 years. Here are excerpts from that conversation:
 Q. 
This new film of yours really blends some unusual elements, like mixing documentary and fictional techniques, and was shot in a most unusual setting. How did the idea for "Caesar Must Die" emerge?
 A. 
 Paolo: We had various ideas for projects, but none of them completely engaged and convinced us. Then we met with pure chance. We received a phone call from a journalist friend of ours, who said, "Go to the prison at Rebibbia, where the prisoners in this maximum security facility, all of them in for murder, perform Shakespeare." We thought, "Oh, it will be the same old thing." We have a certain age at this point, we've seen many, many productions. So we have certain defenses.
Instead, we were completely overwhelmed by emotion when we saw what was happening there. During one production I looked at Vittorio and Vittorio looked at me, and I said, "What are you doing, crying?" and he said, "What are you doing, crying?" So we said, "This emotion is so strong we have to communicate it through the cinema." Now I'll pass the ball.
 Vittorio: This is just like when we make a film. He shoots for a bit, then I shoot, then he shoots, then I shoot. We're always equal. Anyway, we immediately had this sense that this was a great idea come down to us from the heavens, that these compatriots of ours who are tragic figures really, they know crime and conspiracy, let's let them tell the tragedy of Julius Caesar and Mark Antony, which is an Italian story, a Roman story, a story that's part of the collective imagination of the Italian people.
 Q. 
In technical terms, this film was something of a departure for you. It's almost like you were making a low-budget independent film.
 A. 
 Paolo: We shot the film in 21 days, with very little money, just as when we were very young. So from the economic point of view, we were returning to our earliest state.
 Q. 
That must have been fun.
 A. 
 Paolo: Yes, it was exciting. There was no time or need to reflect on anything, so we were free, and this really helped the film. No stars, and shooting digitally. It's the first time we shot digitally, so that was a novelty for us. Normally we shoot quite rapidly, but with this film, we let the camera go a little bit more, saying, "Continue, continue," instead of stopping and doing a lot of takes. On the one hand it's beautiful, but on the other it's a self-condemnation, because when you have to go edit the film, there are rivers of footage.
 Q. 
You mention that you take turns directing. How does that actually work?
 A. 
 Paolo: We write together, with me sitting here and him sitting there, across from each other. But writing is one thing, and dealing with all the variables on the set is another. If there are 10 scenes to be shot, Vittorio begins, the crew that knows us asks, "Who's the first today?" And while that person is at the helm, the crew has to answer only to the director in charge at that moment. They can't go and ask Paolo something they want to do. When it's finished, I come in and look at the video.
 Vittorio: The other is at the monitor, watching the video. We have a very acute nonverbal, telepathic communication. If the one at the monitor starts to scratch his head, the other understands. So we have a silent meeting, we correct it, and then off we go again.
 Q. 
So the habit of shifting doesn't confuse the crew, but what about the cast?
 A. 
 Paolo: Marcello Mastroianni couldn't figure it out for a long time. When we were making "Allonsanfan," we explained our working method to him, and he didn't know what to say. Then a light bulb went off, and he came to the set one day and asked, "PaoloVittorio, what are we shooting today?"
 Vittorio: I adore Marcello. When he went to Cannes with that film, the journalists were all surrounding him, asking, "Mastroanni, you worked with two directors, how did you manage that?" And he looked at them and said "Were they two?"
 Q. 
At this stage in your career, do prizes and honors mean more or less than when you were young men?
 A. 
 Paolo: After we won prizes at Cannes years ago, we said, "We want to return with our new film, but out of competition." So we've done that at Cannes four times now. This was our decision. But when this film was invited to Berlin, we realized, "Our actors are prisoners, waiting for a chance to talk to the world about it, so let's go to Berlin in competition." We did it more for them than for ourselves. We were told that when we were given the prize, they were listening to the radio, and there was a huge noise. It was a great joy for them.
 Q. 
You have competed once before for the Oscar, with "Night of the Shooting Stars" 30 years ago. What do you remember from that experience?
 A. 
 Paolo: United Artists was our distributor, and right at that time the company broke up. And that was that. The people who acquired the film created a new company, and the film remained with the people who didn't choose it. So it was abandoned to its destiny.
 Q. 
In other words, this is your first real shot at an Oscar.
 A. 
 Vittorio: We'll see, we'll take it calmly. It's a really lovely recognition, but our colleagues from around the world have really wonderful films as well. It's important that the competition should occur on a level playing field. It shouldn't be that one film invests a million dollars and another film doesn't have that ability. It's important that the competition be fair. I'm speaking about the commercial aspect and financial investment in Oscar campaigns.
 Paolo: But prizes are always welcome, because then you are in very good company.

HEADLINE: In Fledgling Agency, a Potential Monitor for Wall St. Regulators

BYLINE: JESSE EISINGER


HIGHLIGHT: The Office of Financial Research was created to conduct independent research on the sweeping risks to the financial system, but it was hobbled from the get-go by a poor design. 

 BODY:
 The financial industry is obsessed with President Obama's second-term regulatory appointments. Who will be Treasury secretary? Who could head the Federal Housing Finance Administration? But hardly anyone is paying much attention to the Office of Financial Research.
This entity was created by the Dodd-Frank Act to conduct independent research on the sweeping risks to the financial system. Ah, right, another group of Washington wonks who will issue reports carrying vague warnings of risks looming sometime in the uncertain future. Yawn. I hadn't paid much attention either. 
But then I spoke to Ross Levine, an economist and specialist in regulation at Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, and I finally got it. The Office of Financial Research is a great idea. And as I grasped it, I felt a minor sense of horror, as when you see a precious ring slip off a finger in slow motion and go down the drain while you are powerless to stop it.
The office is looking as if it will be a tool of the financial services industry, instead of a check on it. Its main role is to serve the Financial Stability Oversight Council, providing the systemic risk overseer with data and analysis of where the nukes are buried.
But the Office of Financial Research was hobbled from the get-go by a poor design. It is housed in the Treasury Department, while ostensibly being independent of it. It has a small budget. And it has to report to the very regulators it is supposed to report on.
This month, it announced its advisory committee. Thirty big names charged with giving the fledgling operation direction and gravitas. But these same people have also compromised it.
By my count, 19 of the 30 committee members work directly in financial services or for private sector entities that are dependent on the industry. There are academics, but many of them have lucrative ties to the financial services industry. I noted only one financial industry critic: Damon A. Silvers, the policy director for the A.F.L.-C.I.O.
"Academics with a history of challenging regulators are not there," said Anat R. Admati, a finance professor at Stanford and the co-author, with Martin Hellwig, of the forthcoming call to arms, "The Banker's New Clothes" (Princeton University Press). She was among several prominent banking critics who had applied but didn't make the cut.
The Treasury Department sees it differently.
"We were not looking for critics or proponents. That wasn't the goal," said Neal S. Wolin, the Treasury deputy secretary. "We were looking for people with a range of perspectives who understand keenly the systemic risks in the financial system."
Mr. Wolin said that the office would be independent despite its home. The argument for being housed in the Treasury Department is that if it were all by its lonesome, brand new and small, it would be much easier to be squashed like a bug.
Maybe. But it's not as if there isn't a precedent for creating a better advisory council: Sheila Bairdid it for another regulator, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. That panel, the Systemic Resolution Advisory Committee, has Professor Admati; Paul A. Volcker; John S. Reed, the former co-chief executive of Citigroup and now a prominent banking apostate; and Simon Johnson, the former head economist for the International Monetary Fund and outspoken banking nemesis.
Perhaps Professor Admati and Mr. Johnson and Mr. Volcker were busy. The world is teeming with expert critics of Big Banking; they just aren't heard from much in the halls of Washington. The Federal Reserve Banks of Kansas City and Dallas have candidates. The economist Joseph Stiglitz would make a good choice. The Bank of England houses two prominent banking critics, Andy Haldane and Robert Jenkins. Outfits like Better Markets or Demos could nominate people who would give Jamie Dimon some indigestion.
Certainly, financiers are not a monolithic lot. Investors often have differing interests from those of banks, and investment banks from commercial banks, and the small from the large. Even in big institutions, there are secret sharersof anti-Wall Street sentiment. And obviously, an advisory committee requires a certain number of experts with real-world experience.
Clearly, there is a place for finance professionals. But shouldn't the balance of the committee be tilted in the opposite direction and give greater voice to the critics and the banking skeptics? This is a panel that is supposed to identify giant risks in the system that bankers ignore in their pursuit of profit and bonuses and to spot flaws in regulations that could cost the public and economy trillions.
It's not as if the poor bankers don't have a voice in Washington, after all. The bankers have the resources. And they are focused. Bankers are in the trenches all day, fighting regulation. The public only glances at these battles.
So why does yet another Washington advisory panel of worthies matter? Mr. Levine has a subtle and fascinating answer. He starts by pointing to the mystery of the home-team advantage in sports, which has long puzzled researchers.
It turns out that umpires are biased toward the home team not out of conscious or recognizable bias. Rather, they subconsciously gravitate toward their immediate "community" - in this case, the home-field crowd, especially at crucial moments in a game. (Researchers will next study how this appears to have no effect whatsoever on the New York Jets.)
To minimize the bias, you can tell the umpires that they are being monitored. Introduce instant replay. With that, you have expanded the community that is watching the umpires to an audience far beyond the home crowd.
Mr. Levine believes that the Office of Financial Research could do the same for regulators. If it independently examined and publicized not just systemic risks, but - crucially - the flaws in how the regulators were approaching those risks, that could have the effect of expanding the regulators' community. Regulators, he said, "operate within financial services industry. They are surrounded by it."
"That means that the home-field crowd is the financial services industry," he said. "The public, if it has a ticket at all, is way up in bleachers, and its voice can't be heard."
The Office of Financial Research is well on its way to barring the gate.
Before the crisis, the consensus was that the Office of Thrift Supervision was the regulator most in the pocket of Big Banking. For its efforts, it got shut down as part of the postcrisis regulatory overhaul.
"Now, the title of 'Most Captured' is up for grabs," Mr. Johnson said. "And I think we have a contender."

HEADLINE: How Much Facebook Might Make Through Gifts

BYLINE: SOMINI SENGUPTA


HIGHLIGHT: There's no way to know for sure, but a back of the envelope calculation shows that Gifts could produce modest revenue for Facebook in the short term. 

 BODY:
Facebook's Gifts product can be lucrative for the data it can offer to Facebook. But whether it can be a moneymaker for the company remains a mystery.
Facebook has not offered any estimates of revenue through Gifts. But a thought experiment, with a back of the envelope calculation, yields some rough answers. 
The company says it has 186 million users in the United States and Canada. About 168 million of them are in the United States, according to Socialbakers, a Czech analytics company. Right now, Gifts is available only to users in this country.
Let's say 5 percent of them buy a gift on Facebook this year for one of their Facebook friends. That's almost 8.5 million people. If Facebook is correct in saying they spend an average of $25, that's a bit more than $200 million.
Facebook gets a cut of that. Let's take the high end of industry standard commission: 15 percent. That would generate about $30 million in revenue for Facebook, a fraction of the $5 billion in revenue that the company is projected to generate this year.
Should Facebook get half of its American users sending gifts it's possible that the company could see revenue of about $315 million. Still small, so it would need to get the world sending those $25 gifts before the revenue amounted to much.
Brian Blau, an analyst for Gartner, said: "Given the program only started recently, and it's only available to a limited number of Facebook users, it's difficult to say exactly how users are reacting."
Could it expand worldwide and make more money? Possibly. To date, most of its revenue comes from advertising in North America, even though the vast majority of its users are abroad. The problem is, some of its largest and fastest-growing markets are countries like Brazil and India, emerging economies where the average user is less likely to spend $25 on a gift.
Gift giving has not been an easy market to crack for any of the Web giants. Amazon certainly has a rich history of purchases for its customers, but it doesn't offer an easy way to figure out what to buy for whom. Apple's iTunes allows customers to buy gifts for friends. But as I found out last weekend, Apple bizarrely limits people to giving within the same country. (So much for globalization.)
Facebook has a rich record of its users' friends all over the world and knows important gift-giving occasions - birthdays, graduations and the like. But it doesn't quite know - not yet, anyway - what to buy for whom. As it compiles more of its users' likes and wants, it is likely to get better at recommending the right gifts for the right people.
It could, of course, hasten that process by buying Pinterest. Now that would tell the clueless husband instantly what his wife really wants.

HEADLINE: Ignoring the Science on Mammograms

BYLINE: DAVID H. NEWMAN, M.D.


HIGHLIGHT: Despite years of data challenging the effectiveness of mammograms, why do doctors and patients continue to ignore the science? 

 BODY:
Last week The New England Journal of Medicine published a study with the potential to change both medical practice and public consciousness about mammograms. 
Published on Thanksgiving Day, the research examined more than 30 years of United States health statistics to determine, through observation, if screening mammography has reduced breast cancer deaths. The researchers found that, as expected, the introduction of mammogram screening led to an increase in the number of breast cancers detected at an early stage.
But importantly, the number of cancers diagnosed at the advanced stage was essentially unchanged. If mammograms were really finding deadly cancers sooner (as suggested by the rise in early detection), then cases of advanced cancer should have been reduced in kind. But that didn't happen. In other words, the researchers concluded, mammograms didn't work. 
This is a bold claim for an observational study. There are countless reasons why conclusions from such studies are commonly fraught with error. What if, for instance, the lion's share of advanced cancers occurred among women without access to screening mammograms-a fact often not available in health statistics? Or what if mammography successfully prevented a major increase in advanced cancers, leaving the health statistics unchanged?
Hippocrates, the father of medicine, called experience "delusive." He recognized that uncontrolled observations may lead to faulty conclusions. For centuries the flawed logic of observational data seemed to validate bloodletting, an unhelpful and often harmful therapy. But most who were bled eventually improved-no thanks to the bloodletting-an observation that led medical authorities to believe in the practice.
Fortunately, we have learned something about bad logic. Today we seek studies designed to neutralize illusions. By enrolling people in a study and assigning them randomly to treatments, for instance, groups tend to be evenly balanced in every way except one: the treatment. Controlled studies led to the discovery that bloodletting is harmful rather than helpful, and randomized trials of screening mammography would therefore be a worthy gold standard to answer once and for all the question of whether the test saves lives. 
It may be surprising, therefore, to learn that numerous trials of mammography have indeed randomly assigned nearly 600,000 women to undergo either regular mammography screening or no screening. The results of more than a decade of follow-up on such studies, published more than 10 years ago, show that women in the mammogram group were just as likely to die as women in the no-mammogram group. The women having mammograms were, however, more likely to be treated for cancer and have surgeries like a mastectomy. (Some of the studies include trials from Norway, the Netherlands, Sweden, and this major review of the data.)
In other words, mammograms increased diagnoses and surgeries, but didn't save lives-exactly what the researchers behind last week's observational study concluded. 
It is affirming to see this newest study. But it raises an awkward question: why would a major medical journal publish an observational study about the effects of screening mammography years after randomized trials have answered the question? Perhaps it is because many doctors and patients continue to ignore the science on mammograms.
For years now, doctors like myself have known that screening mammography doesn't save lives, or else saves so few that the harms far outweigh the benefits. Neither I nor my colleagues have a crystal ball, and we are not smarter than others who have looked at this issue. We simply read the results of the many mammography trials that have been conducted over the years. But the trial results were unpopular and did not fit with a broadly accepted ideology-early detection-which has, ironically, failed (ovarian, prostate cancer) as often as it has succeeded (cervical cancer, perhaps colon cancer). 
More bluntly, the trial results threatened a mammogram economy, a marketplace sustained by invasive therapies to vanquish microscopic clumps of questionable threat, and by an endless parade of procedures and pictures to investigate the falsely positive results that more than half of women endure. And inexplicably, since the publication of these trial results challenging the value of screening mammograms, hundreds of millions of public dollars have been dedicated to ensuring mammogram access, and the test has become a war cry for cancer advocacy. Why? Because experience deludes: radiologists diagnose, surgeons cut, pathologists examine, oncologists treat, and women survive. 
Medical authorities, physician and patient groups, and 'experts' everywhere ignore science, and instead repeat history. Wishful conviction over scientific rigor; delusion over truth; form over substance. 
It is normally troubling to see an observational study posing questions asked and answered by higher science. But in this case the research may help society to emerge from a fog that has clouded not just the approach to data on screening mammography, but also the approach to health care in the United States. In a system drowning in costs, and at enormous expense, we have systematically ignored virtually identical data challenging the effectiveness of cardiac stents, robot surgeries, prostate cancer screening, back operations, countless prescription medicines, and more. 
When Thomas Jefferson described his vision for the institution that would become the University of Virginia, he said:
This place will be based on the illimitable freedom of the human mind. For here we are not afraid to follow truth, wherever it may lead.
As we begin down the arduous path of health care reform, requisite to economic success, the question for policymakers and health care authorities is this: Are we ready to stop ignoring science? If so, the road may be smoother than we imagined for there is, and has been, much truth to follow. 

Dr. David Newman is an emergency room physician in New York City and author of the book, "Hippocrates Shadow: Secrets from the House of Medicine."

HEADLINE: Look Before You Leap: Understanding the Mathematics of the Fiscal Cliff

BYLINE: PATRICK HONNER and MICHAEL GONCHAR


HIGHLIGHT: In this lesson, students explore some basic quantitative consequences of falling off the fiscal cliff by looking at the effects that changing income tax rates and payroll tax rates will have for individual taxpayers and the federal government. 

 BODY:
 Overview | What is the fiscal cliff? What will happen if we "go over" it? In this lesson, students explore some basic quantitative consequences of falling off the fiscal cliff by looking at the effects that changing income tax rates and payroll tax rates will have for individual taxpayers and the federal government.

 Materials | Computers with Internet access, chart paper and calculators
 Warm-Up | Have students examine the New York Times interactive (also available as a printable PDF), which represents the impact of the "Bush tax cuts" of 2001 and 2003. Explain to students that these tax cuts lowered the rate at which individual income was taxed by the federal government and have students analyze and discuss the interactive, exploring questions like "How much does an average person save per year because of these cuts?" and "Who benefits most?"
Tell the students that these tax cuts were extended by President Obama but are scheduled to expire at the end of the year; their expiration is part of the "fiscal cliff" the United States is approaching. Ask students to write down their thoughts on what might happen when these tax cuts expire: 

        
How will individuals be affected?
        
How might the larger economy be affected?
        
Will the government benefit or suffer?
 Note: While this lesson is geared toward helping students understand the mathematics behind the fiscal cliff, exploring the politics behind the cliff can help frame what is happening and why. The interactive "Staking Out Positions in the Fiscal Talks" provides a brief overview of the major players in the fiscal negotiations and where they stand on issues like taxes, entitlement programs and spending cuts. The article "Seeking Ways to Raise Taxes but Leave Tax Rate As Is" gives additional background about the most recent fiscal negotiations.
 Related | The article "Q&A: Understanding the Fiscal Cliff" from The Times's blog explains what might happen if the United States goes over the fiscal cliff:
Almost everyone who pays taxes would see a hit to take-home pay in the first paycheck of January. The lowest income tax rate would rise to 15 percent from 10 percent. The highest rate would rise to 39.6 percent from 35 percent. The 25 percent, 28 percent and 33 percent rates would rise to 28 percent, 31 percent and 36 percent, respectively. Most capital gains taxes would rise to 20 percent from 15 percent. The tax rate on dividends, now set at 15 percent, would jump to ordinary income tax rates, and since most dividend taxes are paid by the wealthy, that would mean a new dividend tax rate of 39.6 percent. The exemption on taxation of inherited estates would drop to $1 million from $5 million. The tax rate above that exemption would jump to 55 percent from 35 percent.
 Background Vocabulary: Read the entire article with your class, then answer the questions below. You may wish to introduce students to the following words or concepts before reading: exemption, sequestration, bipartisanship.
 Questions | For discussion and reading comprehension:

        
How will individuals be affected by the fiscal cliff?
        
How will government programs be affected by the fiscal cliff?
        
What are some of the specific policies involved in the fiscal cliff?
        
What are some proposals for avoiding the fiscal cliff?
        
What is President Obama expected to do regarding the fiscal cliff?
 Activity | The phrase fiscal cliff refers to a collection of economic policies that are set to expire or be enacted at the start of 2013. These policy changes could drastically alter the economic and financial landscape of the country. This math lesson focuses on exploring two policies that directly affect individual taxpayers: the expiration of the so-called Bush tax cuts, and the expiration of the payroll tax cut.
The Bush tax cuts refer to two acts of legislation passed during the presidency of George W. Bush that effectively reduced the amount of federal income tax individual Americans paid. The acts were passed in 2001 and 2003. These tax cuts were extended by President Obama but are set to expire and are part of the impending fiscal cliff.
Have students research the federal income tax rates that were in place before and after the Bush tax cuts were enacted. (Here is a list of historical tax rates.) Have them create a table of income levels (PDF), and have them compute and compare the amounts of tax an individual at different levels would have to pay (a) under current tax rates and brackets, and (b) using the rates and brackets from 2000 (the year before the first of the two Bush tax cuts were enacted). To simplify matters, use only the "Single" status category for all tax calculations.
Keep in mind that these are marginal tax rates. That is, someone earning $100,000 in 2003 would be in the 28 percent "tax bracket," but their income tax is not 28 percent of $100,000; they pay only 28 percent on the amount of their income above the next lowest bracket, which in this case ends at $68,800. Thus, this hypothetical individual earning $100,000 in 2003 would be taxed in the following way: 10 percent on the first $7,000; 15 percent on the amount from $7,000 to to $28,400 (a total of $21,400); 25 percent on the amount from $28,400 to $68,800 (a total of $40,400); and 28 percent on the amount from $68,800 to $100,000 (a total of $31,200). Thus, this individual's income tax would be (0.10 * $7,000) + (0.15 * $21,400) + (0.25 * $40,400) + (0.28 * $31,200) = $22,746.
The payroll tax cut is also set to expire at the end of this year. Individuals must pay a certain percentage of their income into Social Security. The payroll tax cut reduces the amount employees and the self-employed must pay from 6.2 percent to 4.2 percent of their total income.
Have students calculate the difference that this 2 percent makes in the take-home pay of individual earners, and have them add this information to the chart. Keep in mind that only income up to $110,000 is taxable by Social Security - no income above that amount will be taxed at any rate.
When the chart is complete, have students put the numbers in context. Have them calculate the total increase in taxes for each income level. If these tax cuts expire, how much more will individuals be paying per year in taxes? How much less money will an individual have to spend per month? Per week? As a percentage, how much more will each income level pay in taxes?
Then discuss the implications of these tax increases. How do you think they will affect the families in the lowest income brackets? How will they affect families in the highest income brackets? How will they affect the United States economy if families have less money to spend? You may want to read "Whether 'Fiscal Cliff' or Debtpocalypse, by Any Name, It Spells Austerity" and "A Chance to Tackle Inequality" for additional analyses of the impending fiscal crisis. 
 Going Further | Here are additional way to explore this topic in depth using math:
 Cutting Spending: The fiscal cliff does not just include tax increases. It also currently includes a budget sequestration - broad automatic cuts in federal spending. Read "White House Details Potential Effects if Automatic Budget Cuts Go Through." Choose five federal programs discussed in the article, write down the amount of 2013 cuts according to the article and then calculate how much the 2012 budget is for each program. Use the following excerpt to help with your calculations:
Under the terms of those cuts, most military programs face a 9.4 percent reduction, while most domestic programs would be sliced by 8.2 percent. Medicare would be trimmed by 2 percent, while other social programs - excluding Social Security - would be sliced by as much as 10 percent. 
Example: The National Institutes of Health faces a $2.5 billion cut. The cut represents a 8.2 percent reduction (nonmilitary). Therefore, the N.I.H.'s 2012 budget is around $30.5 billion.
2.5 billion = x * .082
x = 30.5 billion total budget
The automatic cuts have been compared to slashing a budget "blindfolded," because budgets are not being determined based on the needs of government programs. If you were involved in the fiscal negotiations, what recommendations would you make for cutting spending? Would you be in favor of these "blindfolded" cuts? Are there specific programs that you would recommend for cutting spending? Are there any programs that you think should maintain current spending, or even increase spending? 
 Raising Taxes on the Wealthy: One of the central questions in the fiscal debate, as it was during the recent presidential campaign, is: How much should the wealthy pay in taxes? Look back at historical tax rates and compare current rates with rates from previous decades, like the 1970s or 1950s. How do they compare? What differences do you notice? Then, look at the Interactive "Your Coming Tax Cut (or Not)" used in this lesson's Warm-Up. What does the interactive illustrate about how the Bush tax cuts affected wealthy Americans?
Have students read one or more of the articles below and discuss arguments for and against increasing taxes on the wealthy. If students are in favor of increasing tax rates, they should articulate by how much and for which tax brackets. You may want to assign different articles to different students or groups:

        
"Politics Complicates the Math in Ending Tax Breaks for Rich"
        
Warren Buffet's Opinion piece "A Minimum Tax for the Wealthy"
        
"Tax Talks Raise Bar for Richest Americans"
        
Grover G. Norquist's 2011 Opinion piece "Read My Lips: No New Taxes"
 Considering Policy: In addition to having students explore how individuals will be affected, have them consider the policy changes from the perspective of the government. More income tax means more revenue, but how much more? Take a look at income distribution in the United States, estimate how much more total tax revenue will be generated for the federal government from these higher rates using your completed tax chart, and put this number in the context of Mr. Obama's 2013 budget proposal. Click on the "Department Totals" button to see how the federal government spends its money on different government programs. What do you think the federal government should do with new revenues raised by increasing taxes? Should the money be used to reduce the deficit? Prevent cuts in certain programs? Increase spending in any areas?
 Scaling the Budget to Household Size: The world-famous mathematician Terence Tao suggests rescaling federal budget numbers by converting $100 million to $3. This has the effect of scaling the entire federal budget of $3.54 trillion to a "household scale" of around $105,000. Have students convert the federal numbers calculated above into this "household" scale to put the numbers in a more understandable context, or have them create a scale of their own.

HEADLINE: Toyota RAV4: Cutting Edge? Not This Time

BYLINE: TORI TELLEM


HIGHLIGHT: The 2013 Toyota RAV4 arrives in dealerships in January. 

 BODY:
 Introduced on Wednesday: 2013 Toyota RAV4
 What it is: This is the world premiere of the fourth-generation RAV4, which was introduced in the United States in the mid-1990s. It was among the first "cute-ute" compact crossovers at the time, although these days it's leaning more toward "anti-climactic-ute." 
 What it isn't: Repeat, it's not a Toyota Highlander, although it's easy to wonder whether the new RAV4 has been sheep-dipped and is poised to take over the identity, purpose and sales of its barely bigger brethren.
 What makes it tick: There's no longer a V-6 engine available - "the Highlander is for more power," said Bill Fay, the Toyota Division Group vice president and general manager. The RAV4's 2.5-liter, 4-cylinder is paired with a new 6-speed transmission. Both front- and all-wheel drive will be offered; the A.W.D. will have dynamic torque control for improved traction. There will also be two driving modes, Sport and Eco. The estimated fuel economy is 24 miles per gallon in the city and 31 highway, with all-wheel-drive models at 22/29.
 How much, how soon? It arrives in dealerships in January. Pricing shouldn't change too drastically from the outgoing model, still hovering around $22,000 to start.
 Our take: Redesigns are hotly anticipated for taking surprising risks in the style department that make the competition sweat. Less exciting is when they are safe, like what Toyota did with the redesigned RAV4: inflating a Camry and calling it a day. Unless you call moving the signature rear-mounted spare tire to underneath the cargo area cutting edge.

HEADLINE: Ford Extends Warranties on MyFord Touch System

BYLINE: CHRISTOPHER JENSEN


HIGHLIGHT: Ford and Lincoln owners have complained that the MyFord Touch and the MyLincoln Touch systems often malfunction. 

 BODY:
In an effort to mollify owners of the problematic MyFord Touch and MyLincoln Touch systems, Ford is extending the warranty and providing owners with a way to upgrade the system, the automaker said Wednesday. 
In a telephone interview, Alan Hall, a Ford spokesman, said the automaker would increase the coverage on the Ford system from three years, or 36,000 miles, to five years with unlimited mileage. Coverage on the Lincoln system will increase from four years, or 50,000, miles to six years and unlimited mileage. The action covers owners of all 2011, 2012 and 2013 models.
Mr. Hall also said the automaker was offering current owners the chance to upgrade their software to the latest version. That can be done by going to www.syncmyride.com.
The extension of the warranty is aimed at making sure owners will have the latest version of the software, Mr. Hall said.
"It is really about making it easy and making our owners confident that they will be receiving ongoing software upgrades as we continue to evolve the software," he said.
The system - which could be considered MyFord Ouch - largely replaced knobs with a touch screen. It is supposed to make it easy to adjust everything from the climate control to the navigation system, but it has been an embarrassing problem for the automaker.
Owners have complained the system is confusing, overly complicated and often malfunctions. Owners have been so unhappy that Ford's customer-satisfaction ratings with J.D. Power and Associates and Consumer Reports plummeted.
That has forced Ford to acknowledge the problems, which it had declined to do originally.
The system made its debut on 2011 models.
In 2010, when a writer was reviewing the 2011 Explorer for The New York Times, he told a Ford official that the MyFord Touch was an ergonomic disaster. The official insisted it was merely a matter of understanding how it worked and said he would send along an owner's manual. It was 52 pages long.
Speaking to reporters at the Los Angeles auto show, Ford's president of the Americas, Mark Fields, said, "We're thinking more and more like not only a car company, but a technology company," according to Reuters.

HEADLINE: The Growing Burden of Payroll Taxes

BYLINE: OWEN ZIDAR


HIGHLIGHT: Though they are regressive, payroll taxes have accounted for an increasing share of federal tax revenues in recent decades, and it is time to find alternatives, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Owen Zidar, a doctoral student in economics at the University of California, Berkeley, was previously a staff economist at the Council of Economic Advisers and, in 2008-9, an analyst at Bain Capital Ventures. 
Payroll taxes and corporate income taxes accounted for an equal share of federal tax revenue in 1969. By 2009, payroll taxes generated more than six times as much revenue. We've become reliant on payroll taxes, and a goal of a tax overhaul should be to reform and reduce them, permanently.
First, some background. The share of federal tax revenues coming from payroll taxes has doubled since the 1970s, to about two-fifths of revenue. The payroll tax, underwriting social insurance programs, nearly surpassed the individual income tax as the single largest source of federal tax revenue in 2009. 
Since payroll taxes finance Social Security and part of Medicare, cost growth in these programs pressures policy makers to raise those taxes. In particular, pressure from the Social Security disability insurance program and Medicare Part A has been intensifying. 
The number of disability recipients has increased nearly sixfold since 1970. Disability outlays exceeded revenues by roughly $34 billion in 2011. And costs are likely to continue growing because shrinking labor market opportunities for noncollege-educated workers are likely to continue well past this recession. The Congressional Budget Office's long-run projections for the program support this conclusion.
Pressure on the payroll tax from Medicare Part A is even worse. Health cost growth has steadily outpaced inflation, and the pattern shows no sign of abating. Fundamental economic forces - such as Baumol's cost disease, which describes the phenomenon of rising costs in industries less conducive to automation - will most likely continue to increase health care costs steadily.
The primary argument for severing the link between these growing programs and the payroll taxes is that the tax is regressive: It uses a flat rate on income up to $110,100, does not apply to most income above that threshold and does not apply to nonlabor income, like capital gains. Because of this relatively regressive nature, payroll tax cuts tend to be a more effective stimulus than typical income tax cuts - and thus are a more effective way for Washington to respond to recessions.
Despite these features, AARP and other groups often resist payroll tax cuts out of a fear that the cuts will undermine the future of the safety net (even though the cuts are fully paid for out of general revenue). Permanently breaking the link between payroll taxes and both disability and Medicare would allow the tax code to become more progressive - and do more to offset inequality - without creating political problems when the business cycle calls for fiscal stimulus.
Obviously, the government would need other revenue if it severed the link between payroll taxes and the safety-net programs. One option would be to limit tax breaks, as Congress and the Obama administration have recently discussed. Others include phasing in a carbon tax, raising top marginal rates slightly or overhauling the tax code to use a progressive consumption tax that encourages saving.
The country is almost certain to face higher costs for health care and for an aging work force whose skills are being outpaced by technology. But there is no reason those costs must be borne by a regressive tax vulnerable to recurring struggles over economic policy.

HEADLINE: What Spending Would be Cut if a Debt Deal is Not Reached?


HIGHLIGHT: An explanation of what spending would be cut if a deal is not reached on the so-called 'fiscal cliff.' 

 BODY:
An emergency unemployment-compensation program is expiring, which would save $26 billion but end payments to millions of Americans who remain jobless and have exhausted state benefits. Medicare payments to doctors would be reduced 27 percent, or $11 billion, because this year Congress has not passed the usual so-called "doc fix" to block the cuts, which otherwise are required by a 1990s cost-control law. 
The biggest cut would be $65 billion, enacted across the board for most federal programs over the last nine months of fiscal year 2013, from January through September. This cut, known as the sequester, was mandated by an August 2011 budget deal between Mr. Obama and Congress that ended their standoff over raising the nation's debt limit. In that deal, they agreed to reduce spending by $1 trillion over 10 years and to identify an additional $1.2 trillion in savings by January 2013. If they fail to agree on the second installment - as is the case so far - the automatic cuts will kick in.

HEADLINE: From Sundance, a Competition Slate That Could Be Called Accessible

BYLINE: BROOKS BARNES


HIGHLIGHT: The Sundance Film Festival unveils a lineup that could be considered accessible. 

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES - Sundance, known for championing dark and inscrutable films, has unveiled an unusually accessible - and sellable - competition lineup.
On Wednesday programmers for the 2013 Sundance Film Festival released the list of features and documentaries that will compete for grand jury and audience prizes in Park City, Utah, in January. And in the esoteric department there are a few doozies, including Shane Carruth's "Upstream Color," a metaphorical drama described as the story of a man and woman "entangled in the life cycle of an ageless organism."
But the competition lineup also brims with comedy: "Austenland," from a writer of "Napoleon Dynamite," pokes fun at Jane Austen fans, while "C.O.G." adapts a David Sedaris work. And the selections are packed with familiar movie and TV stars. Jessica Biel, Daniel Radcliffe, Rooney Mara, Jane Lynch, Jennifer Coolidge, Casey Affleck, Kristen Bell, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Ellen Page and Octavia Spencer (among others) all perform in competition films. 
In a joint interview John Cooper, Sundance's director, and Trevor Groth, the festival's programming chief, cautioned against scrutinizing their lineup too carefully for trends, noting that they are at mercy of what gets submitted. And "accessible" is a relative concept, they noted; these selections are aimed squarely at an art house crowd and not a broad multiplex audience. A big hit in Sundance's world means movies like "Beasts of the Southern Wild," which played in competition last year and took in $11.2 million at the box office.
"Over all, the quality of independent film is getting better and better each year," Mr. Cooper said. "The industry is healthy enough for people - actors, directors, producers, casting directors - to sustain themselves in careers."
Both men pointed to forces inside and outside the festival that are contributing to competition films that are more audience friendly, starting with the creation in 2010 of a Sundance category called Next. Devoted to more experimental, low-budget fare, Next has absorbed some pictures that would have previously been slotted in the competition. This year Next includes unusual movies like "Escape From Tomorrow," a hallucinogenic drama about a father's mental breakdown.
Changing distribution models also play a role. In the past a theatrical and DVD release was the only real option for Sundance films to get seen beyond the festival. But the rise of video on demand, both on television and online, has provided additional exposure for the films and made stars more willing to participate. At the same time filmmakers have adapted by embracing stories that are more palatable - more clearly defined stories, lighter topics - to a V.O.D. audience.
"Sundance seems to have smartly focused more intently on programming not only for artistic quality but also for consumer accessibility," said Kevin Iwashina, managing partner of Preferred Content, a movie production, sales and advisory company. "That in turn guarantees that the festival will impact culture beyond its 10-day run."
The jackpot for filmmakers, of course, remains finding theatrical distribution, and so Sundance is typically judged - to the chagrin of its founder, Robert Redford - by how much money distributors like Fox Searchlight are willing to spend on selections that are for sale, which is almost all of them.
This year two competition films in particular are generating advance buzz. David Lowery's cinematic "Ain't Them Bodies Saints" is a potential critical darling. Telling the story of a Texas outlaw and his wife, it stars Ms. Mara, Mr. Affleck, Keith Carradine and Ben Foster ("3:10 to Yuma").
"Kill Your Darlings," from the producer Christine Vachon ("Boys Don't Cry") and first-time director John Krokidas, stars Mr. Radcliffe, Mr. Foster and Elizabeth Olsen ("Martha Marcy May Marlene"). This movie looks at a murder that brought together a young Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac and William Burroughs.
The competition lineup includes 56 feature and documentary films, culled from 4,044 submissions, an increase of only two over last year. (The year before, submissions surged 6 percent.) 
The festival will slowly dole out its out-of-competition lineups over the next week. These programs include the more star-driven Premieres section; midnight thrillers and comedies; "spotlight" movies that have already played other festivals; and experimental films. Sundance will run Jan. 17 to 27.
The pre-eminent showcase for American independent cinema, Sundance has long prided itself on championing female directors - in sharp contrast to Hollywood - and about a third of next year's competition films were directed or co-directed by women. Francesca Gregorini, a second-time filmmaker (and Ringo Starr's stepdaughter), will be there with "Emanuel and the Truth About Fishes," about a troubled girl who becomes obsessed with her neighbor. "Touchy Feely," a drama about a massage therapist stricken with an aversion to bodily contact, is from the writer-director Lynn Shelton, known for the 2009 comedy "Humpday."
The festival's high-profile opening slot went to "May in the Summer," a drama about a bride-to-be who re-evaluates life after reuniting with her family in Jordan; it was written and directed by Cherien Dabis ("Amreeka"), who also stars in the leading role. Morgan Neville's heartfelt documentary about the lives of backup singers, "Twenty Feet From Stardom," will also play opening night, along with a still-to-be announced shorts program.
Documentaries are one of Sundance's strengths, and the competition crop focuses on the usual topics: abortion, AIDS, war, drug cartels, economic inequality. But selections also include lighter documentaries, like Zachary Heinzerling's "Cutie and the Boxer," a look at the 40-year marriage of the painter Ushio Shinohara and his wife, Noriko.
An unusual number of movies in the 2013 competition were made by people who cut their teeth in television. "Afternoon Delight," a dark comedy about a Los Angeles housewife who tries to rescue a stripper by hiring her as a nanny, was written and directed by Jill Soloway, a producer of shows like "Grey's Anatomy" and "United States of Tara." Liz W. Garcia ("Cold Case," "Memphis Beat") arrives with her first movie, "The Lifeguard," starring Kristen Bell as a lifeguard who starts a dangerous relationship with a troubled teenage boy.
"I love that filmmakers are taking stories that we've seen before and finding entirely new ways to tell them," Mr. Groth said.

HEADLINE: SAC's Conference Call for Investors

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: SAC Capital Advisors is trying to reassure investors. | Lloyd C. Blankfein, Goldman Sachs's chief, is said to be headed to the White House to discuss the nation's fiscal troubles. | MegaFon of Russia got a chilly reception on its first day of trading. | Thanks to a United States court ruling, Argentina may be approaching another default. 

 BODY:
The hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors is holding a conference call with investors on Wednesday morning to address the latest insider trading charges leveled at a former employee, DealBook's Peter Lattman reports. A conference call is an unusual move for a hedge fund, but, according to Bloomberg News, investors are particularly concerned about the case against Mathew Martoma, a former SAC portfolio manager. For the first time, the government has linked the hedge fund's founder, Steven A. Cohen, to questionable trades.
Mr. Cohen "remains committed to managing money for clients," Mr. Lattman reports. About 40 percent of SAC's $14 billion under management comes from outside clients, who face restrictions on withdrawing money. Mr. Cohen has not been charged with wrongdoing, and it was unclear whether he would participate in the conference call. Executives at SAC "have already reached out to the firm's largest investors to calm concern" about the ostensibly improper trades, Bloomberg News reports. 
BLANKFEIN GOES TO WASHINGTON | Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, has been on something of a mediatourrecently to warn about the so-called fiscal cliff. Now, he is headed to the White House, along with other business leaders, to talk about ways to avoid the spending cuts and tax increases set to take effect at the start of next year, according to Bloomberg News. Speaker John Boehner and other House Republican leaders are also said to be scheduled to meet with the chief executives.
Morgan Stanley's boss, James P. Gorman, is taking a different approach. Mr. Gorman wrote a memo to Morgan Stanley's employees asking them to pressure lawmakers to reach a compromise, according to The Wall Street Journal. "No issue is more critical right now for the U.S. economy, the global financial markets and the financial well-being of our clients, which is why I am asking you to participate in the democratic process and make your voice heard," the chief executive said, according to the newspaper.
MEGAFON'S SHARES FALL IN DEBUT | MegaFon, the Russian cellphone operator, got a chilly reception from investors on Wednesday, as its shares fell in the first day of trading. The company had priced its shares at $20 apiece, the bottom of its expected range, and raised $1.7 billion in the I.P.O. Last week, Steven M. Davidoff discussed concerns about the offering in a Deal Professor column.
ON THE AGENDA | Stephan Leithner, Deutsche Bank's chief compliance officer, is scheduled to appear before a German parliamentary committee examining rate manipulation. Edward DeMarco, the acting director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, speaks at the Exchequer Club in Washington in 12:30 p.m. Workday, which went public last month, reports earnings after the market closes. Warren E. Buffett is on CNBC at 8:30 a.m. James Chanos of Kynikos Associates joins Howard Lutnick, chief executive of Cantor Fitzgerald, and Lawrence H. Summers in a discussion about Washington's fiscal troubles on Bloomberg TV at 4 p.m. Data on new home sales in October is to be released at 10 a.m.
ARGENTINA'S DEBT MESS | Thanks to a United States court ruling, Argentina may be approaching another default. The country's long-running battle with a group of hedge funds became even messier last week, when a judge ruled that, if the government makes a scheduled $3 billion payment to bondholders on Dec. 15, it would also have to set aside $1.33 billion for the hedge funds, which own older bonds. Argentina is not expected to pay the hedge funds, including Elliott Management and Aurelius Capital Management, which its politicians have called "vultures."
The situation is now "chaos," Steven M. Davidoff writes in the Deal Professor column. Argentina's stock market has fallen, and credit-default swaps on its debt have skyrocketed in price. The case offers "a lesson on the hazards of United States courts' interfering in international affairs," Mr. Davidoff writes. "The Federal District Court overseeing this case through a decade of tiring litigation seems more focused on cramped legal interpretations and the morality of debt than on the wider consequences of its rulings."
FACEBOOK'S MOVE INTO E-COMMERCE | Wall Street analysts have started saying positive things about Facebook, months after its disappointing debut on the public market. That is in part because of its new Gifts service, which allows users in the United States to buy presents for their friends. Somini Sengupta reports in The New York Times: "If it catches on, the service would give Facebook a toehold in the more than $200 billion e-commerce market. Much more important, it would let the company accumulate a new stream of valuable personal data and use it to refine targeted advertisements, its bread and butter."
A NEW LEADER FOR GROUPON? | Andrew Mason, Groupon's colorful chief executive, is in the hot seat. According to AllThingsD, several Groupon board members have been "seriously discussing making major leadership changes," including possibly hiring a new chief executive. The board has a meeting on Thursday, when it may discuss such matters. Pressure has mounted on Mr. Mason in the wake of Groupon's accounting issues, and as the stock price has fallen more than 80 percent since the I.P.O. last year. AllThingsD cautions that any move to remove Mr. Mason "is not likely to happen immediately, if at all," and "any changes are likely to be done with his involvement."

HEADLINE: Bipartisan Group Recommends Middle Ground on Aid to Egypt

BYLINE: PETER BAKER


HIGHLIGHT: A bipartisan task force is recommending that President Obama rethink the country's approach to Egypt and pursue a "quid pro quo" relationship that conditions American aid on the new Islamist government's cooperation on terrorism and other issues. 

 BODY:
 A bipartisan task force is recommending that President Obama rethink the country's approach to Egypt, and pursue a "quid pro quo" relationship that conditions American aid on the new Islamist government's cooperation on terrorism and other issues. 
 After decades of cooperation with Hosni Mubarak's government, the United States should build ties with President Mohamed Morsi based on mutual interests, the task force said in a report to be released on Wednesday. Rather than assume Washington can change the Islamists' ideology, the task force said, policy can leverage Egyptian behavior.
 The report comes at a decisive moment in the evolving relationship between Washington and Cairo. Just last week, Mr. Morsi proved to be a critical player in working with Mr. Obama to broker a cease-fire in Gaza, leading the White House to think he could be a constructive partner in the region. But the next day, Mr. Morsi provoked an uproar at home with an edict temporarily exempting his decrees from judicial review. 
 The task force, formed by the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, was headed by Vin Weber, a former Republican congressman from Minnesota who advised Mitt Romney's campaign for president, and Gregory B. Craig, a former White House counsel under Mr. Obama and top State Department official under President Bill Clinton.
 In essence, the task force recommended a middle ground between continuing aid to the new Egypt without conditions and cutting it off.
 The United States should "confront Egyptian leaders with a set of stark choices that would give them a pathway to act as responsible national leaders rather than as religiously inspired ideologues," the report said. It called for "an approach whereby the United States continues to provide substantial economic and military aid while linking both direct support and backing for international financial support to Egyptian cooperation on key U.S. interests."
 For example, the task force suggested devoting part of United States aid to Egypt, starting at $100 million and growing over time, to encourage the government to do more to fight terrorists in the Sinai Peninsula. Mr. Obama and Congressional leaders should also tell Cairo that human rights violations or a retreat from democratic reform would make it harder to maintain a beneficial relationship.
At the same time, the task force said Washington should expand its contacts with political opposition in Egypt and recommit to spending tens of millions of dollars to support the development of civil society. "Now is not the time to trim the sails of U.S. outreach," the report said. "To the contrary, now is the time to redouble U.S. effort to talk with the broad array of actors in Egypt's fluid political environment."

HEADLINE: RIM's Market Share Slips Some More

BYLINE: IAN AUSTEN


HIGHLIGHT: RIM's market share fell further in the United States, but the biggest surprise was the slippage in Europe and Latin America. 

 BODY:
Shortly after some stock analysts raised their ratingsfor Research in Motion, a new market share report showing that the company's once iconic BlackBerry brand now holds just 1.6 percent of the American smartphone market sank expectations for the company.
A year ago during the same quarter leading up to the end of October, the Kantar Worldpanel ComTech report estimated BlackBerry's share at 8.5 percent. 
Just as surprising as the extent of RIM's collapse in the United States was the report's finding that BlackBerry was rapidly retreating in European countries where buyers previously had remained loyal to the brand.
In Britain, once RIM's largest market outside North America, BlackBerry's market share plummeted to 7.9 percent from 19 percent. In economically troubled Spain, BlackBerry went to just 3.4 percent of the market from 23.7 percent.
RIM's shares closed at $10.72 on Nasdaq on Tuesday, down $1.26 or 10.5 percent. Late on Wednesday afternoon, they were trading at $11.07, up 35 cents or 3.3 percent.
"We understand the competitive nature of the global smartphone market and the need for innovation," Amy McDowell, a spokeswoman for RIM, said in an e-mail. "We are confident thatBlackBerry 10 will provide our customers with an exciting alternative to our competitors, and we are committed to regaining market share."
While RIM has been boasting about BlackBerry's success in Latin America, the report shows that the thrill is gone in Brazil. It estimates BlackBerry's market share there at 2.7 percent, down from 8.7 percent.
The only good news from the report by Kantar Worldpanel ComTech, which is owned by WPP, the advertising, public relations and market research company, came from Germany. That, coincidentally, is the birthplace of Thorsten Heins, RIM's president and chief executive. There BlackBerry accounted for 2.5 percent, up from 1.6 percent.
Germany was also an exception in that it was the only market covered by the report where Apple's share declined despite the release of the iPhone 5. It fell to 17 percent from 22.1 percent.
By contrast, in the United States, all iPhone models accounted for 48.1 percent of the market, more than doubling last year's 22.4 percent share. Some of Apple's gain there came at RIM's expense. The report found that 6 percent of those who bought an iPhone 5 during the period were BlackBerry owners.
Overall, however, phones based on Google's Android operating system proved to be the most popular alternative for disgruntled BlackBerry owners. Of those who switched phone brands in the United States in the last six months, Kantar Worldpanel ComTech found that 63.4 percent went with an Android handset.
The study's researchers found that many buyers were attracted by the new iPhone's larger screen, as well as its ability to use faster wireless networks known as 4G or LTE.
Mr. Heins has acknowledged that RIM would produce "challenging" numbers until it begins selling its new BlackBerry 10 phones and operating system next year. It features a screen similar in size to that of the iPhone 5, and it will be compatible with high-speed wireless networks.
Expectations that RIM will meet its planned release date of Jan. 30, as well as positive comments from wireless carriers now testing the BlackBerry 10, led to the analysts' upgrades of their share target prices.

HEADLINE: A Night Life Veteran Bets on Social Media

BYLINE: By LAURA M. HOLSON

 BODY:
IT was 10:30 p.m. on a recent Saturday, and the Westway, on Clarkson Street in Manhattan's West Village, was practically throbbing. The club would not be open to the public until midnight, but for an hour and a half a private masquerade birthday ball had been going on inside.
Guests, mostly in their 20s, had paid $25 to attend. Some were lined up three-deep at the bar; others crowded an adjoining black-walled room dominated by a raised catwalk. There, young men in jackets and ties stared slack-jawed as female revelers danced in short skirts onstage. As midnight approached, the crowd of 200 -- some already coupling in dark corners -- danced wildly as ''Call Me Maybe'' blasted overhead. 
Near the dance floor, Andy Russell, 41, a married father of two, surveyed the crowd. At seven feet tall he has an imposing yet boyish presence; even more so that night from the metallic eye mask strapped to the top of his head, his errant curls slipping through the eyeholes. By the time Mr. Russell was the age of many of those dancing, he had engineered hundreds of parties like this one, several as a founder of Moomba, the celebrated late 1990s restaurant and nightclub on Seventh Avenue South that was packed nightly with celebrities like Madonna and Leonardo DiCaprio until it closed in 2001.
Now, after leaving behind night life for a career as an investor in and adviser to digital media companies like DailyCandy and Thrillist, Mr. Russell is back. He, as much as anyone, understands the short shelf life of a Manhattan club. And it is why he founded Host Committee, a social networking Web site that arranges private early evening events like the one at the Westway.
Most Manhattan clubs don't come alive until well past midnight. Mr. Russell wants to reimagine night life, or at least resuscitate parts of it, by getting night crawlers to come out early, giving club owners much-needed revenue during slow hours and Host Committee guests access to venues where it is hard to pass the forbidding velvet rope.
Much has changed since Mr. Russell and his brother, Chris, a restaurant consultant and entrepreneur, stormed downtown with Moomba, which was so popular in its heyday it was featured in a ''Saturday Night Live'' skit; its investors included Oliver Stone, the director, and the art dealer Larry Gagosian. ''New York City was alive and electric, you had the Palladium, the Limelight, all walks of people were mixing and matching,'' Mr. Russell said earlier Saturday night at Miss Lily's on Houston Street, where he had ordered the curried goat. ''Now I think it's uniform. People have found a model and rarely deviate.''
Before the smartphone generation took over the 2000s, clubs like Moomba thrived on mystique, big personalities and the promise of cool. But now, said Noah Tepperberg, an owner of Avenue and Marquee in New York and Lavo in Las Vegas, ''the idea of creating an elusive place that people want to get into is gone.'' With easy access to information on cellphones or online, club-going has become more democratic, he said. ''Now, you can be stuck outside waiting in line and know what's going on inside,'' he said. ''People don't want to go someplace unless they know what they are getting.''
That is what makes Host Committee, which is almost three months old, interesting to nightclub promoters. The recession has affected club business, and owners will do anything to bring in new customers, said Michael Musto, the gossip columnist for The Village Voice and tireless bon vivant. ''I once had to wait outside a club for an office party to end,'' he said with a laugh. ''In the old days you needed a song and dance to get past the door of a club. Now you just pull out money. It is the democratization of night life.''
But he is skeptical that private parties like the ones arranged by Host Committee will become a permanent part of the local club scene.
''Everything goes in a cycle, and clubs are doing everything they can to make a dollar,'' Mr. Musto said. ''I think once we enter a more prosperous era, this will vanish and the pleading and begging to get into clubs will begin again.''
AS a Manhattan teenager in the mid-1980s, Mr. Russell used to gather with his friends on weekend nights on the steps of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. ''There were all these kids in New York hanging out with no place to go,'' he said. ''You couldn't go to bars or people's apartment.'' It was then he decided to host parties in empty dance studios. Mr. Russell would meet the social leaders at a local high school and ask them to host a party and invite their friends. Attendees were charged a fee at the door, usually $10. Some nights, Mr. Russell said, parties brought in $2,000 or more.
After Mr. Russell left Manhattan for Cornell in 1989 (from which he graduated with a degree in psychology in 1993), he continued to host Manhattan soirees. ''We hired pretty girls to get mailing lists,'' he said. In the early 1990s, for example, 1,000 people showed up at a New Year's Eve event he held at a downtown club; it lasted until 4 a.m. ''I came home with $40,000 in cash,'' Mr. Russell said. (He stuffed the money in his wall for safekeeping.) ''I loved partying with a purpose.''
Mr. Russell loves partying, period. He said he once flew to Reykjavik, Iceland, for 27 hours to attend a bachelor bash. He has an old-style bar at his country home in North Salem, N.Y., and built a movie theater in a former grain silo attached to the house. (He also has an apartment in Manhattan.)
Bob Pittman, a friend and chief executive of CC Media Holdings, which owns radio stations and who worked with Mr. Russell for eight years after Moomba closed, remembered a beer-guzzling contest at Mr. Pittman's home in Mexico during a 2005 retreat. ''He lost,'' Mr. Pittman said of Mr. Russell. ''He was crestfallen.''
''I think he is an eager puppy about everything,'' he added. ''That is what endears him to a lot of his friends.''
In November 1996, two months before he went to business school at Columbia, Mr. Russell and his brother opened Moomba. ''It was the first of the smaller venues that had great success,'' said David Rabin, a partner in the Lambs Club and the Double Seven who has known Mr. Russell for 15 years and who is on his advisory board. Mr. Russell sold most of his stake in Moomba in 1999. But despite the club's popularity, it wasn't much of a moneymaker; Mr. Russell said he made only about $100,000 after investors were paid off.
In 2003, he joined the Pilot Group, a private investment firm founded by Mr. Pittman, where he focused on investing in digital media companies, until last year when he started his own company, Trigger Media, with about $22 million from investors.
''I wouldn't do it again,'' Mr. Russell said of opening a Moomba today. ''I'm interested in building a business, not building a restaurant or a club.''
KIARA HORWITZ, 26, a publicist for Fingerprint Communications, was one of eight people who hosted the masquerade birthday ball at the Westway. She said she knew nearly half the crowd there and noted it was refreshing to get home by 12:30 a.m. ''I like getting everyone together in one place,'' she said. ''I thought people were really into the early thing. It kind of blew my mind.''
Host Committee is based in principle on the parties Mr. Russell gave in high school, with a new-media twist. At the company's office on 26th Street, Zeeshan Zaidi, the venture's chief executive, oversees party pages that are set up for hosts to invite friends (who, in turn, invite their friends), mostly over Facebook or by e-mail. Once a guest accepts an invitation and pays a fee (typically around $25), a profile is posted online so other guests can see who is coming. There is incentive to show up early: free drinks are served for the first hour. There's a cash bar after that.
Mr. Russell is mindful that he is past his prime networking days; his other major current venture is an e-mail newsletter called ''InsideHook,'' which advises men from 35 to 55 where to find an expert tailor or a good steak. So he recently bought DBD Social, a free-event planning service run by Carli Roth and Yvonne Najor, two 20-something women who have a large contact list to mine for potential hosts and their paying guests.
Ms. Roth and Ms. Najor were two of the 16 hosts for ''Hump Day,'' a party organized by Host Committee on Oct. 10 from 8 to 11 p.m. at the Double Seven, the upscale cocktail lounge in the meatpacking district of which Mr. Rabin is an owner. One hundred and eighty-seven guests paid $20 each to attend. Mr. Rabin said that, thanks to those guests' enthusiastic drink purchases, the Double Seven made about $6,000 ''in a period when we wouldn't take in one-third of that.'' He waved away the issue of exclusivity (''Why wouldn't we want 100 or 150 people in our target demographic telling people they like the place?'') and added that he told Mr. Russell to target guests who will become regulars. ''For Andy, it is finding the sweet spot for the different venues,'' he said.
Mr. Russell, though, has a bigger goal in mind. He said he wants Host Committee to be responsible for at least 2,000 marriages.
''A lot of people feel more comfortable socializing online than in person,'' he said. ''The problem with social media is that it has destroyed the social part.''

HEADLINE: Avery Fisher Hall to Be Renovated

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
Lincoln Center and the New York Philharmonic are planning a radical re-envisioning of Avery Fisher Hall that will require the orchestra to relocate for two seasons and aims to redefine what it means to be a concert hall at a time of challenging orchestra economics and changing audience habits.
Rather than proceed with a previous redesign plan, which has been stalled for years, officials said they would solicit new architectural proposals to overhaul the building, which remained conspicuously untouched while the rest of Lincoln Center was transformed over the last decade. The renovations are intended to improve the hall's lackluster acoustics, replace outdated patron amenities and reconfigure the auditorium. Construction is not expected to start before 2017.
The shell of the building, which opened in 1962 and was designed by Max Abramovitz, will be left intact. But the interior will offer patrons a new concertgoing experience. 
''It's not going to be a fix-up,'' said Katherine G. Farley, Lincoln Center's chairwoman. ''If you're going to do this, you shouldn't do a better version of what's already built.''
The hall's renovation was originally going to be part of Lincoln Center's campuswide redevelopment. There was an architectural competition, won by the British architect Norman Foster, whose redesign was approved in 2005. But the project never went anywhere, owing in part to the daunting prospect of raising $300 million in construction costs and the orchestra's fear that it might lose audiences and revenue while it was displaced.
Now Lincoln Center, which owns and operates the hall, and the Philharmonic say they are pressing forward with renewed confidence, buoyed in part by the warm reception that has been given to the $1.2 billion rejuvenation of the rest of the campus, which was designed by Diller, Scofidio & Renfro and completed this fall.
The Philharmonic also now feels a sense of urgency. Many orchestras have folded in the past 10 years while patrons have moved away from season-long subscriptions in favor of single ticket sales.
''If you're not thinking about the way in which our art form and music and audiences are evolving, you're not serving the art form long term,'' said Matthew VanBesien, who this year became the orchestra's executive director. ''You really want to build this next great hall in a new way, to do the kinds of things you maybe are doing but want to do in a more compelling way or maybe can't even imagine yet.''
The parties acknowledge they have yet to resolve several important questions, including the budget for a new design, how fund-raising will be divided between the orchestra and Lincoln Center and where the Philharmonic will play during construction.
''All options are on the table,'' Mr. VanBesien said of possible stages. The Park Avenue Armory -- where the Philharmonic performed last summer -- is assumed to be one possibility, along with the David H. Koch Theater, which recently lost a major tenant, New York City Opera.
''We will look both on and off campus,'' Mr. VanBesien said. ''We will look at multiple venues. I think we use this opportunity to really find some special connections throughout the city.''
Lincoln Center officials said that the latest progress on Avery Fisher has been made possible in part because of the Philharmonic's new leadership, including Mr. VanBesien, as well as Gary W. Parr, the board chairman, and Alan Gilbert, the music director.
''You have three guys under 50 who are thinking hard about what's the future of music,'' said Ms. Farley, a senior managing director at the real estate company Tishman Speyer. ''Vigorous planning is under way now.''
The building will retain its name -- in part because the family of Avery Fisher, for whom the hall was renamed in 1973, has threatened legal action if the building's name were to change.
The auditorium, however, is expected to be a major naming opportunity for a donor, along the lines of the $100 million gift Mr. Koch, the oil and gas billionaire, gave to what was called the New York State Theater, home to New York City Ballet.
For now the parties are trying to establish timetables for the selection of an architect and acoustician. A theater designer has been chosen, though officials declined to name the person.
Mr. Foster's firm seemed unaware that the parties are planning another search for an architect. Asked to respond, a Foster & Partners spokeswoman said in an e-mail: ''Obviously we would like to continue working with our clients to realize this project.''
While the specific design elements are undecided, the renovation's goals are clear: to create a space that can accommodate various configurations -- including a thrust stage, a proscenium or a theater in the round -- and to create an environment that honors the conventions of a concert hall even as it expands on them.
''We want a concert venue that has really excellent acoustics but has an intimacy to it, a sense of immediacy, an almost visceral quality,'' Mr. VanBesien said. ''Some will choose a more formal concert environment, but there is no question that we'll over the long haul experiment with less formal environments.''
For example the new hall should be able to handle the more theatrical presentations that have been spearheaded by Mr. Gilbert, Mr. VanBesien said, like Ligeti's ''Grand Macabre,'' Janacek's ''Cunning Little Vixen'' and the concert this coming June of two Stravinsky ballets that includes a dancer.
''You can do those things in a hall like Avery Fisher,'' Mr. VanBesien said. ''But can you imagine designing a venue that not only allows you to do them but do them even better?''
The current auditorium has been criticized for its rigid formality and inflexibility, and for the distance between audience members and the musicians.
The acoustics will be carefully examined with the aid of sophisticated computer modeling. Ms. Farley described a lab that lets orchestras simulate how their halls will sound with certain seating changes, like removing the third balcony, something Mr. Foster had proposed.
''We're also anticipating the consequences of readjustments of the hall,'' said Reynold Levy, president of Lincoln Center. ''If seat counts are reduced, what's the consequence of that for ticket revenue? For rentals?''
The relationship between Lincoln Center and the Philharmonic has been strained in the past, in part by the Philharmonic's aborted merger with Carnegie Hall in 2003 and by conflicts over control of the hall's calendar. (Lincoln Center, the parent organization, presents programming in the hall during the Philharmonic's off-season.)
That relationship has been improving. To allow for more time to resolve questions about an Avery Fisher renovation, for example, Lincoln Center extended for three years its constituency agreement with the Philharmonic, which had been set to expire in June 2011.
Those involved in Avery Fisher discussions said the tone has been positive and collaborative.
''This is a new process,'' Mr. VanBesien said. ''And we're going through that process in a fresh way.''

HEADLINE: BP Is Barred From Taking Government Contracts

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER and STANLEY REED; John M. Broder reported from Washington, and Stanley Reed from London.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The United States government has temporarily banned the British oil company BP from new federal contracts, citing the company's ''lack of business integrity.''
The decision comes after BP agreed to plead guilty this month to criminal charges over the 2010 Deepwater Horizon blowout and oil spill that killed 11 workers and polluted hundreds of miles of Gulf of Mexico shoreline. As part of its settlement, the company agreed to pay penalties of $4.5 billion, including $1.26 billion in criminal fines.
The Environmental Protection Agency said Wednesday that BP's suspension from new contracts would remain in effect ''until the company can provide sufficient evidence to E.P.A. demonstrating that it meets federal business standards.'' 
Although the suspension does not affect the company's existing federal contracts, the action is nonetheless a blow to BP. It is one of the government's largest contractors, with $1.47 billion in federal business in 2011, according to a ranking compiled by the General Services Administration. Much of that revenue comes from the Defense Department, to which it provides more than $1 billion a year in fuel.
''It is not great news for BP, as they want to do business in the U.S.,'' said Iain Pyle, an analyst at Bernstein Research in London.
The company's shares closed down 0.4 percent in London trading, although they rose slightly later in New York trading. Its depositary receipts on the New York Stock Exchange rose 13 cents to $41.48.
An E.P.A. official said that BP would have to satisfy the terms of its plea agreement, made with the Justice Department, before the agency would consider lifting the ban.
In addition to paying the fines and penalties, the company must hire a safety monitor to oversee its deepwater operations, retain an ethics monitor to ensure that company employees do not again skirt federal laws and regulations, conduct safety and environmental audits for each drilling rig, and ensure that all equipment and workers meet federal safety and training standards.
Government officials would not speculate on how long it would take the company to meet those conditions.
The E.P.A.'s decision appeared to take BP by surprise. During a conference call with analysts on Nov. 15, the day the company and the government announced the plea deal, BP's general counsel, Rupert Bondy, said, ''We have not been advised of the intention of any agency to suspend or debar us in connection'' with the settlement. The deal, however, stated that the government reserved the authority to restrict BP's ability to receive government contracts or other benefits.
A BP spokesman, David Nicholas, said Wednesday that despite the E.P.A.'s action, the company remained ''engaged'' with the agency. ''We are working through a process demonstrating present responsibility,'' he said, referring to the legal standard that BP needs to meet before the suspension is lifted.
BP's finances could suffer if the suspension is not lifted quickly because the United States accounts for such a large part of its business, representing 19 percent of its global oil and gas production in the third quarter and about one-fourth of the profit in its important exploration and production unit.
The heart of its American business is the Gulf of Mexico, where BP helped lead the way into deepwater drilling in the late 1980s. Its operations in the gulf, previously the source of some of its most profitable oil, are still a long way from returning to prespill levels. According to a company spokesman, production from fields it operates there now averages about 150,000 barrels a day of oil or its natural gas equivalent, which is only about one-third of output before the spill.
The slump is largely a result of BP's being unable to conduct routine maintenance drilling because of the moratorium the government imposed on all gulf drilling after the blowout. That moratorium was lifted in October 2010, but new permits were not issued until early 2011. Although many oil companies were affected by the moratorium, BP was hit hardest because it was the region's biggest deepwater oil and gas leaseholder.
Even before the E.P.A. announced its decision, BP had voluntarily decided not to participate in a gulf lease sale that the Interior Department held on Wednesday, according to a company spokeswoman.
Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, had earlier called for a contracting ban on BP for its actions after the spill and for misleading Congress about the rate of oil flow from the damaged well.
''After pleading guilty to such reckless behavior that killed men and constituted a crime against the environment, suspending BP's access to contracts with our government is the right thing to do,'' Mr. Markey said Wednesday. ''The wreckage of BP's recklessness is still sitting at the bottom of the ocean, and this kind of time out is an appropriate element of the suite of criminal, civil and economic punishments that BP should pay for their disaster.''
BP says it has invested $52 billion in the United States over the last five years, more than in any other country, and it employs 23,000 Americans.
In another sign of the spill's continuing fallout, BP is still selling assets elsewhere to help pay for the disaster's costs, which total about $42 billion so far.
On Wednesday, BP announced the sale of North Sea oil fields representing about 25 percent of its British oil and gas production to Taqa, an energy company that belongs to the Abu Dhabi government, for about $1.1 billion.
Although BP has agreed to a settlement of criminal charges in the Deepwater Horizon case, it still faces billions of dollars in pollution fines under federal environmental laws.
Prosecutors are also continuing to investigate and bring charges against individuals involved in the case.
In New Orleans on Wednesday, two former BP rig supervisors were arraigned on manslaughter charges arising from the disaster. One of the supervisors, Robert Kaluza, told reporters before entering a plea of not guilty that he had not caused the accident, according to The Associated Press. He and Donald Vidrine, another site leader, were indicted on a charge of failing to heed abnormal well pressure tests.
Mr. Kaluza's lawyer, Shaun Clarke, said his client was a scapegoat. ''Bob and Don did their jobs,'' he said, according to the A.P. report. ''They did them correctly and they did them in accordance with their training.''
A former BP vice president, David Rainey, also pleaded not guilty to misleading Congress about the spill's flow rate.

HEADLINE: Obama Tilts Tax Debate Away From Spending Cuts

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER; Jonathan Weisman contributed reporting from Washington, and Nelson Schwartz from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama surrounded himself with taxpayers on Wednesday to pitch his plan to preserve current rates for the middle class and raise them for the wealthy. A day before, he met with small-business owners for the same purpose. On Friday, he plans to fly to Pennsylvania to tour a factory to make the same point.
As the president and Congress hurtle toward a reckoning on the highest federal budget deficit in generations, Mr. Obama says he wants a ''balanced'' approach to restoring the nation's fiscal order. But the high-profile public campaign he has been waging in recent days has focused almost entirely on the tax side of the equation, with scant talk about his priorities when it comes to curbing spending. 
Mr. Obama has embraced specific cuts to the federal budget in the past and has committed to an agreement with Congress that will include deep reductions in spending. But it would be easy for those who listen to his public pronouncements lately to miss it. In public statements since his re-election, he has barely discussed how he would pare back federal spending, focusing instead on the aspect of his plan that plays to his liberal base and involves all gain and no pain for 98 percent of taxpayers.
Republicans and even some Democrats have expressed frustration that Mr. Obama has avoided a serious public discussion on spending with barely a month until deep automatic budget cuts and tax increases are scheduled to take effect. While the president's aides said it was important to engage the public on taxes, others say he has not prepared the country for the sacrifice that would come with lower spending.
''The problem is real,'' said Erskine B. Bowles, who was co-chairman of Mr. Obama's deficit reduction commission. ''The solutions are painful, and there's not going to be an easy way out of this.''
After meeting with White House officials this week, Mr. Bowles said he believed ''they were serious about reducing spending'' but added that ''we need to talk more about the spending side of the equation.''
Republican leaders were more scathing, saying the president was more interested in campaigning than sitting down to resolve difficult issues. They said they were willing to raise tax revenue by closing loopholes and limiting deductions, but Mr. Obama has not reciprocated with more restraint of entitlement programs.
''We have not seen any good-faith effort on the part of this administration to talk about the real problem that we're trying to fix,'' said Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House majority leader. ''This has to be a part of this agreement or else we just continue to dig the hole deeper, asking folks to allow us to kick the can down the road further. And that we don't want to do.''
Although Mr. Obama has not scheduled a new meeting with Congressional leaders, he will dispatch top advisers to Capitol Hill for talks on Thursday. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner and Rob Nabors, the White House legislative director, will pay separate visits to Senators Harry Reid of Nevada and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Democratic and Republican leaders, and Representatives John A. Boehner of Ohio and Nancy Pelosi of California, the Republican speaker and Democratic minority leader.
Mr. Obama met privately on Wednesday with the chief executives of 14 major corporations like Goldman Sachs, Home Depot, Marriott, Coca-Cola, Pfizer and Yahoo to discuss the fiscal situation.
''He seemed flexible, but he said taxes should go up on the top 2 percent,'' said one executive who did not want to be named. Most of the executives said they were not opposed to tax increases as part of a deal but stressed that a quick resolution could help the economy.
White House officials rejected Republican suggestions that Mr. Obama has not been serious enough about tackling the growth of entitlement spending. ''He is committed, every time he talks about this, to a balanced approach that includes both, you know, revenues, spending cuts and savings through entitlement reforms,'' said Jay Carney, the White House press secretary.
White House officials pointed to $340 billion in health care entitlement program savings and $272 billion in reductions to other mandatory programs over 10 years in a previous presidential budget proposal. ''Even though that budget proposal's been out there for a long time, a lot of people aren't aware of that,'' Mr. Carney said. '' He called it ''another piece of evidence that the president has been willing to make tough choices.''
One reason a lot of people may not be aware of the cuts Mr. Obama has proposed is that he does not talk about them often. In his first postelection news conference, he focused on tax increases on the wealthy and used the term ''spending cuts'' just once without elaborating.
By focusing on taxes, Mr. Obama has put Republicans on the defensive. At Wednesday's event, he challenged them to extend Bush-era tax cuts for family income under $250,000 since both sides agree those should continue. Doing so would effectively mean tax cuts on income over $250,000 would expire at the end of the year since Mr. Obama would not sign a separate bill extending them.
The president's public lobbying seemed to crack through the solid Republican opposition this week when a prominent conservative, Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, urged his party to seek such a quick deal with Mr. Obama extending middle-class tax cuts. Mr. Boehner pushed back against Mr. Cole on Wednesday, saying that would hurt small businesses and the economy.
At the same time, Mr. Obama evidently sees no percentage in talking in detail about spending cuts, acutely aware that his liberal base is unenthusiastic about paring back entitlement programs. Senator Richard J. Durbin, a longtime Illinois ally and the No. 2 Senate Democrat, said this week that Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security should not be part of current budget talks.
As the two sides continued to shadowbox, Mr. Bowles was skeptical, putting the chances of a deal by the end of the year at one in three. ''I believe the probability is that we are going over the cliff,'' he said, ''and I think that will be horrible.''

HEADLINE: Firing a Coach, at a Price, With Little Evidence the Move Pays Off

BYLINE: By JER LONGMAN

 BODY:
For an especially lucrative occupation, one might consider becoming a fired college football coach.
The latest symbol of the college football arms race is not the coaches' salaries themselves but rather the money that university officials are spending to buy out those huge contracts when a coach falters.
After Tennessee fired its coach last week, the university's chancellor said the athletic department would forgo $18 million in contributions it was to make to the university over the next three years for academic scholarships and fellowship programs. Instead, some of the money will be used to pay the severance packages of the coach, Derek Dooley, who is owed $5 million, and his staff, which is owed a reported $4 million if it is not retained. Dooley had four years remaining on his contract.
On Sunday, Auburn fired its coach, Gene Chizik, two seasons after the Tigers went unbeaten and won the national championship. Auburn said it owed $11 million in buyouts to its coaching staff, including $7.5 million to Chizik, who had three years left on his contract. He is to be paid $208,334 a month for the next 36 months. The money could have been used to fund other sports. 
''It's shameful,'' said Raymond D. Sauer, chairman of the department of economics at Clemson University and president of the North American Association of Sports Economists. ''We can understand the market forces at work, but all that money being burned up that way is a high cost of doing business.''
Sauer said there was ''a gusher of money'' in the Southeastern Conference. ''But it's limited,'' he added.
Coaches' salaries have soared in recent years at colleges throughout the country, often reaching several million dollars a year, as university officials have intensified efforts to claim some of the sport's growing riches that come from billion-dollar television contracts, merchandise sales and alumni contributions. But college officials do not seem encumbered by the large contracts; rather, they appear willing to pay the coaches handsomely to go away and make room for new hires -- despite little evidence that coaching changes generally result in better teams.
The University of Houston forced its offensive coordinator to resign after one game. After two games, Wisconsin dumped its offensive line coach.
''The pressure has gotten out of control to win,'' said Bradley Dale Peveto, whose contract was terminated last week after four seasons at Northwestern State of Louisiana.
Over the past decade, about 1 in 10 universities at the major college level replaced their head football coaches annually for performance-related reasons. But a recent study suggests that replacements do not tend to make underperforming teams much better in subsequent seasons and frequently make them worse.
Anecdotal evidence and scientific analysis indicate that replacing a coach is no guarantee of success. Houston finished 5-7 this season after changing its coordinator. Wisconsin is a middling 7-5 after firing its line coach. The Badgers reached the Big Ten Conference title game only because N.C.A.A. penalties left Ohio State and Penn State ineligible.
A study published last month in Social Science Quarterly may provide sobering news to Auburn, Tennessee and other universities that have fired their coaches. Using data from 1997 to 2010, the study compared the performance of major college teams that replaced their coach with teams with similar records that kept their coach.
The results, tracked over a five-year period following the coaching changes, might surprise many. The lowliest teams subsequently performed about the same as other struggling teams that did not replace their coach. Mediocre teams -- those that won about half their games in the year before a coaching change -- performed worse than similar teams that did not replace their coach.
The reasons for this are not clearly understood, but may stem from an adjustment period required by a coach at a new university, the time players need to learn a new system and disruptions made to recruiting networks, said E. Scott Adler, an associate professor of political science at the University of Colorado and the lead author of the study.
Statistically speaking, Adler said: ''There's not much to be said for every few years dumping a coach who's had a couple bad seasons. In the long run, you are about in the same situation down the road if you had done nothing and ridden out the storm.''
Adler's own university recently fired its coach, Jon Embree.
There are exceptions, of course, which lend urgency to efforts by fans and administrators to throw out one coach and bring in another. Auburn measures itself against a fierce intrastate rival, Alabama, which is seeking its third national title in four seasons after hiring Nick Saban at a hefty salary that has reached $5.5 million per season, the highest in the country.
Universities view football as a kind of front porch to their campuses, drawing attention in a way that no other endeavor can. Administrators are increasingly reliant on football to support other sports and spur donations at a time when the vast majority of universities lose money on athletics. Desperation to win has increased as universities chase the payouts from billion-dollar television contracts.
Some football coaches have become the highest-paid employees of their states. The average salary for a head coach at a big-time university is $1.64 million, an increase of more than 70 percent since 2006, according to an analysis by USA Today.
Auburn expected better results from Chizik's team this season. The Tigers were 3-9, including an 0-8 record in the Southeastern Conference and an embarrassing 49-0 loss to the Crimson Tide. Reports of an N.C.A.A. investigation into possible rules violations also have surfaced in the news media.
''This could be a prophylactic move by Auburn -- we know what's coming, let's get on the front end of this and maybe lessen sanctions,'' said Robert H. Lattinville, chairman of the sports division of the law firm Stinson Morrison Hecker, which represents numerous coaches.
Chizik's firing comes at a time of growing scrutiny of coaches on talk radio and cable television; rising costs for tickets, TV packages and merchandise; and increased access by fans to administrators via social media.
''People have gotten impatient for a lot of reasons,'' Lattinville said. ''They want more immediate results.''
At the college sports level, Lattinville said, ''you can't fire the players,'' so the coach takes the fall for a lack of success. ''It sends a message to the fan base and recruits that this is important, we're trying, we're doing something.''
At Tennessee, the chancellor, Jimmy G. Cheek, said the university would try to make up for the loss in academic funding through private contributions -- a scenario that has raised concerns among faculty members.
''My long-term concern is the arms race for coaches' salaries,'' said Toby Boulet, an associate engineering professor and a former president of Tennessee's faculty senate. ''If athletics are going to remain self-supporting in Knoxville, we're going to have to find a way to be successful and fund that. I'd like to see the budget set up so that if the football team encounters a rocky patch, scholarships don't go away.''

HEADLINE: Connecticut Aims to Cut $170 Million In Spending

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME

 BODY:
Less than two years after Gov. Dannel P. Malloy pushed through a record tax increase for Connecticut as part of a package to reduce one of the nation's worst budget deficits, the state on Wednesday announced $170 million in spending reductions as the first step to address what officials described as a large and growing long-term budget shortfall.
The reductions were billed as the first part of a process to close a current shortfall, put at $365 million. But in a somber briefing to legislators on Tuesday, the state's budget director, Benjamin Barnes, warning of ''extraordinarily difficult decisions to reduce spending,'' said Connecticut also faced an estimated shortfall of $1.1 billion in 2013-14 that would have to be addressed, beginning next year. 
The cuts include nearly $70 million to health care programs and social service agencies, along with $25 million to public colleges and universities. Programs facing reductions included AIDS services, children's health programs, food stamps, funds for magnet schools, housing and homeless services, and services for elderly and disabled residents.
Mr. Malloy's spokesman, Roy Occhiogrosso, largely blamed the sluggish economic recovery and increasing costs for programs like Medicaid. And he said the disappointing budget picture reflected the state's historic failures in managing its finances.
''The larger point is that this governor inherited an enormous mess,'' Mr. Occhiogrosso said in a budget briefing on Wednesday. ''It took 20 years to dig that hole. It will take us more than 20 months to dig our way out of it.''
But Republicans said Mr. Malloy, a Democrat who was elected governor two years ago, needed to stop blaming others.
''He passed a budget which he said was balanced and which he now owns,'' the Senate minority leader, John P. McKinney, said. ''This is finally a signal that the governor understands that we can't tax our way out of this recession. All the gimmicks have been used up, and our credit card is maxed out.''
The State Office of Policy and Management on Wednesday released a list of $170 million in spending reductions that fell under the governor's powers to rescind appropriations by up to 5 percent of any line item and 3 percent of any fund without seeking legislative approval.
Next month, the governor is expected to announce about $200 million more in proposed cuts that would have to be approved by the General Assembly to address the current deficit. And in his new budget, to be unveiled in February, he is expected to announce another round of more severe and painful long-term cuts to balance the budget going forward.
''Many of these cuts are very difficult to make, especially now when so many residents continue to struggle in a tough economy,'' Mr. Barnes said in a statement. ''But as painful as they are, cuts are necessary to keep this year's budget in balance. State government needs to live within its means.''
Mr. Occhiogrosso said that Mr. Malloy had inherited a $3.6 billion deficit and that the governor's package of tax increases, spending cuts and union concessions had left the state in a much stronger position than when he took office. He said the governor was committed to addressing the deficit without further tax increases, the most recent of which affected income, corporations and an array of purchases and services. ''I think at this point there's very little that's not on the table other than a tax increase,'' he said.
Mr. Occhiogrosso expressed disappointment that the state's budget issues remained so daunting. Still, he said, Connecticut's budget problems were no different from those in other states, including many of its neighbors.
But Mr. McKinney, of Fairfield, said Mr. Malloy had limited options after agreeing to forgo layoffs for four years for anyone hired before July 2011. And he said Democrats had shown no inclination to fundamentally overhaul government. He said that despite the governor's stated intention to avoid tax increases, he expected a contentious legislative session, with both houses controlled by Democrats.
''I don't think Democrats in the legislature are willing to solve the problem without tax increases,'' Mr. McKinney said. ''And I'm even less convinced that the Democrats are willing to look at a major transformation of how we deliver goods and services as a state.''

HEADLINE: Brand-Name Drug Prices Rise Sharply, Report Says

BYLINE: By KATIE THOMAS

 BODY:
The price of brand-name prescription medicines is rising far faster than the inflation rate, while the price of generic drugs has plummeted, creating the largest gap so far between the two, according to a report published Wednesday by the pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts.
The report tracked an index of commonly used drugs and found that the price of brand-name medicines increased more than 13 percent from September 2011 to this September, which it said was more than six times the overall price inflation of consumer goods. Generic drug prices dipped by nearly 22 percent. 
The drop in the price of generics ''represents low-hanging fruit for the country to save money on health care,'' said Dr. Steve Miller, the chief medical officer of Express Scripts, which manages the drug benefits for employers and insurers and also runs a mail-order pharmacy.
The report was based on a random sample of six million Express Scripts members with prescription drug coverage.
The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the trade group representing brand-name manufacturers, criticized the report, saying it was skewed by a handful of high-priced specialty drugs that are used by a small number of patients and overlooked the crucial role of major drug makers.
''Without the development of new medicines by innovator companies, there would be neither the new treatments essential to progress against diseases nor generic copies,'' Josephine Martin, executive vice president of the group, said in a statement.
The report cited the growth of specialty drugs, which treat diseases like cancer and multiple sclerosis, as a major reason for the increase in spending on branded drugs. Spending on specialty medicines increased nearly 23 percent during the first three quarters of 2012, compared with the same period in 2011. All but one of the new medicines approved in the third quarter of this year were specialty drugs, the report found, and many of them were approved to treat advanced cancers only when other drugs had failed.
Stephen W. Schondelmeyer, a professor of pharmaceutical economics at the University of Minnesota, said the potential benefits of many new drugs did not always match the lofty price tags. ''Increasingly it's going to be difficult for drug-benefit programs to make decisions about coverage and payment and which drugs to include,'' said Mr. Schondelmeyer, who conducts a similar price report for AARP. He also helps manage the drug benefit program for the University of Minnesota.
''We're going to be faced with the issue that any drug at any price will not be sustainable.''
Spending on traditional medicines -- which treat common ailments like high cholesterol and blood pressure -- actually declined by 0.6 percent during the period, the report found. That decline was mainly because of the patent expiration of several blockbuster drugs, like Lipitor and Plavix, which opened the market for generic competitors. But even as the entry of generic alternatives pushed down spending, drug companies continued to raise prices on their branded products, in part to squeeze as much revenue as possible out of an ever-shrinking portfolio, Dr. Miller said.
Drug makers are also being pushed by from companies like Express Scripts and health insurers, which are increasingly looking for ways to cut costs, said C. Anthony Butler, a pharmaceuticals analyst at Barclays. ''I think they're pricing where they can but what they keep telling me is they're under significant pressure'' to keep prices low, he said.
Express Scripts earns higher profits from greater use of generic medicines than brand name drugs sold through their mail-order pharmacy, Mr. Butler said. ''There's no question that they would love for everybody to be on a generic,'' he said.
Dr. Miller acknowledged that was true but said that ultimately, everyone wins. ''When we save people money, that's when we make money,'' he said. ''We don't shy away from that.''

HEADLINE: Fed Survey Shows Economy Improving in Most Regions

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A pickup in consumer spending and steady home sales helped lift economic growth in October and early November in most parts of the United States, according to a Federal Reserve survey released Wednesday. The one exception was the Northeast, which was slowed by Hurricane Sandy. 
Growth improved in nine of the Fed's 12 regional banking districts, the survey said. Growth was weaker in New York, Philadelphia and Boston -- areas where the storm caused widespread disruptions.
The survey noted that growth improved despite nervousness about the automatic tax increases and spending cuts that could kick in next year if Congress and the Obama administration cannot reach a budget deal before then.
Hiring increased in more than half of the districts. But manufacturing shrank or slowed in seven regions and was mixed in two others.
The report, called the Beige Book, provides anecdotal information on economic conditions around the country from October through Nov. 14. The information collected by the regional banks will be used as the basis for the Fed's policy discussion at the Dec. 11-12 meeting.
Many economists say they believe that the Fed could announce plans to buy more Treasury bonds at that meeting to replace a program set to expire at the end of the year. The goal of the program is to lower long-term interest rates and encourage more borrowing and spending.
In another economic report Wednesday, the Commerce Department said sales of new homes fell slightly in October, and September sales were slower than initially thought. The October sales pace was dragged lower by steep declines on the East Coast, partly related to the storm.
New-home sales dipped 0.3 percent in October to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 368,000. That was down marginally from the 369,000 pace in September, which was revised lower from an initially reported 389,000.
Sales fell a sharp 32.3 percent in the Northeast and nearly 12 percent in the South. The government said the storm had a minimal effect on the housing data because it made landfall in the final days of the month.
States outside the area affected by the storm fared better. Sales surged 62.2 percent in the Midwest and were up 8.8 percent in the West.
Sales were still 17 percent higher in October than the same month in 2011. Even with the gain, new-home sales were well below the annual rate of 700,000 that economists consider healthy.
''Over the past 18 months, new-home sales have been on the gentle rising trend although they remain at a very depressed level,'' said Steven Wood, chief economist at Insight Economics.
Though new homes represent only a small portion of the housing market, they have a disproportionate impact on the economy. Each home built creates an average of three jobs for a year and generates about $90,000 in tax revenue, according to statistics from the National Association of Home Builders.

HEADLINE: Fledgling Monitor for Wall St. Risks an Early Compromise

BYLINE: By JESSE EISINGER, PROPUBLICA.

 BODY:
The financial industry is obsessed with President Obama's second-term regulatory appointments. Who will be Treasury secretary? Who could head the Federal Housing Finance Administration? But hardly anyone is paying much attention to the Office of Financial Research.
This entity was created by the Dodd-Frank Act to conduct independent research on the sweeping risks to the financial system. Ah, right, another group of Washington wonks who will issue reports carrying vague warnings of risks looming sometime in the uncertain future. Yawn. I hadn't paid much attention either. 
But then I spoke to Ross Levine, an economist and specialist in regulation at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, and I finally got it. The Office of Financial Research is a great idea. And as I grasped it, I felt a minor sense of horror, as when you see a precious ring slip off a finger in slow motion and go down the drain while you are powerless to stop it.
The office is looking as if it will be a tool of the financial services industry, instead of a check on it. Its main role is to serve the Financial Stability Oversight Council, providing the systemic risk overseer with data and analysis of where the nukes are buried.
But the Office of Financial Research was hobbled from the get-go by a poor design. It is housed in the Treasury Department, while ostensibly being independent of it. It has a small budget. And it has to report to the very regulators it is supposed to report on.
This month, it announced its advisory committee. Thirty big names charged with giving the fledgling operation direction and gravitas. But these same people have also compromised it.
By my count, 19 of the 30 committee members work directly in financial services or for private sector entities that are dependent on the industry. There are academics, but many of them have lucrative ties to the financial services industry. I noted only one financial industry critic: Damon A. Silvers, the policy director for the A.F.L.-C.I.O.
"Academics with a history of challenging regulators are not there," said Anat R. Admati, a finance professor at Stanford and the co-author, with Martin Hellwig, of the forthcoming call to arms, "The Banker's New Clothes" (Princeton University Press). She was among several prominent banking critics who had applied but didn't make the cut.
The Treasury Department sees it differently.
"We were not looking for critics or proponents. That wasn't the goal," said Neal S. Wolin, the Treasury deputy secretary. "We were looking for people with a range of perspectives who understand keenly the systemic risks in the financial system."
Mr. Wolin said that the office would be independent despite its home. The argument for being housed in the Treasury Department is that if it were all by its lonesome, brand new and small, it would much easier be squashed like a bug.
Maybe. But it's not as if there isn't a precedent for creating a better advisory council: Sheila Bair did it for another regulator, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. That panel, the Systemic Resolution Advisory Committee, has Professor Admati; Paul A. Volcker; John S. Reed, the former co-chief executive of Citigroup and now a prominent banking apostate; and Simon Johnson, the former head economist for the International Monetary Fund and outspoken banking nemesis.
Perhaps Professor Admati and Mr. Johnson and Mr. Volcker were busy. The world is teeming with expert critics of Big Banking; they just aren't heard from much in the halls of Washington. The Federal Reserve Banks of Kansas City and Dallas have candidates. The economist Joseph Stiglitz would make a good choice. The Bank of England houses two prominent banking critics, Andy Haldane and Robert Jenkins. Outfits like Better Markets or Demos could nominate people who would give Jamie Dimon some indigestion.
Certainly, financiers are not a monolithic lot. Investors often have differing interests from those of banks, and investment banks from commercial banks, and the small from the large. Even in big institutions, there are secret sharers of anti-Wall Street sentiment. And obviously, an advisory committee requires a certain number of experts with real-world experience.
Clearly, there is a place for finance professionals. But shouldn't the balance of the committee be tilted in the opposite direction and give greater voice to the critics and the banking skeptics? This is a panel that is supposed to identify giant risks in the system that bankers ignore in their pursuit of profit and bonuses and to spot flaws in regulations that could cost the public and economy trillions.
It's not as if the poor bankers don't have a voice in Washington, after all. The bankers have the resources. And they are focused. Bankers are in the trenches all day, fighting regulation. The public only glances at these battles.
So why does yet another Washington advisory panel of worthies matter? Mr. Levine has a subtle and fascinating answer. He starts by pointing to the mystery of the home-team advantage in sports, which has long puzzled researchers.
It turns out that umpires are biased toward the home team not out of conscious or recognizable bias. Rather, they subconsciously gravitate toward their immediate "community" - in this case, the home-field crowd, especially at crucial moments in a game. (Researchers will next study how this appears to have no effect whatsoever on the New York Jets.)
To minimize the bias, you can tell the umpires that they are being monitored. Introduce instant replay. With that, you have expanded the community that is watching the umpires to an audience far beyond the home crowd.
Mr. Levine believes that the Office of Financial Research could do the same for regulators. If it independently examined and publicized not just systemic risks, but - crucially - the flaws in how the regulators were approaching those risks, that could have the effect of expanding the regulators' community. Regulators, he said, "operate within financial services industry. They are surrounded by it."
"That means that the home-field crowd is the financial services industry," he said. "The public, if it has a ticket at all, is way up in bleachers, and its voice can't be heard."
The Office of Financial Research is well on its way to barring the gate.
Before the crisis, the consensus was that the Office of Thrift Supervision was the regulator most in the pocket of Big Banking. For its efforts, it got shut down as part of the postcrisis regulatory overhaul.
"Now, the title of 'Most Captured' is up for grabs," Mr. Johnson said. "And I think we have a contender."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Added Routes Signal Growth for China's Sole Low-Cost Carrier

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- Spring Airlines, a small but fast-growing Chinese airline, announced a batch of new routes Thursday between mainland China and Hong Kong, providing the latest sign of the rapid growth of the Asian air travel market. 
Spring, which is based in Shanghai and is aiming to list on a stock market in the coming months, said it would start flights between Hong Kong and four mainland cities -- Hangzhou, Chongqing, Xiamen and Nanjing -- starting Dec. 16. It already operates flights between Shanghai and Hong Kong.
Rising affluence and improved infrastructure across the region have led to a surge in air travel to, from and within Asia.
''Over the past decade, Asia has gone from being a destination market to being an outbound market,'' Andrew Herdman, the director general of the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines, said at an aviation conference in Hong Kong on Thursday. ''The center of economic gravity is shifting from West to East.''
A host of new airlines has sprung up across the region in recent years as a result. This year alone, three new airlines took to the skies in Japan. Scoot, a low-cost offshoot of Singapore Airways, began operations in June.
Spring Airlines was set up in 2005 and has since built up a network of more than 50 routes within China, plus a handful of international routes. Last year, it carried 11 million passengers.
The privately held airline is the only Chinese carrier to operate a low-cost, no-frills model of the kind that shook up the U.S. and European markets in the 1970s and '80s and that has begun to take root in other parts of Asia since the turn of the 21st century.
The vast Chinese market is dominated by state-controlled carriers like China Eastern, China Southern and Air China. The authorities in Beijing, eager to shield the state-run airlines from competition, have so far allowed little low-cost activity on routes to or within China.
Low-cost carriers have a market share of only about 6 percent in China, compared with about a quarter of the market worldwide, according to the Center for Aviation, the Sydney-based research firm that organized the aviation conference in Hong Kong.
As the mainstream Chinese carriers become more efficient and improve their service standards and brands, they are likely to become major players on the international stage, analysts believe.
''In the next 5 to 10 years, Chinese carriers will have a large number of routes into Europe,'' said Peter Harbison, the center's chairman. ''This will change the competitive landscape.''

HEADLINE: Safety First in Mexico

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING

 BODY:
MEXICO CITY -- Mexico's outgoing president, Felipe Caldern, was never much loved. His election in 2006 was overshadowed by claims of fraud by a leftist challenger. He then struggled with a deep recession brought on by the global financial crisis. And throughout his term he sponsored an army-led ''war on drugs,'' which has left a death toll variously estimated at between 65,000 and 100,000. Little wonder that most Mexicans are eager to see him leave office on Saturday.
But there also isn't much enthusiasm about what comes next. The incoming president, Enrique Pea Nieto, a former state governor with a pretty-boy image, represents a restoration of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which ruled the country between 1929 and 2000 through a mixture of repression, corruption, co-option and vote-fixing. The novelty is that Pea Nieto was fairly elected, albeit with only 38 percent of the vote in a three-way race. 
The reality is that Mexicans voted less for the PRI candidate than against those of the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution, or P.R.D., and of Caldern's conservative National Action Party, or PAN. A good many people on the left and right fear that the PRI's authoritarian instincts will soon resurface. Pea Nieto, 46, insists that his party has embraced the new rules of the game.
He has a few things going for him. The country's economy is again growing, with the combination of falling unemployment at home and fewer jobs in the United States bringing a dramatic drop in illegal migration to the north. And thanks to the North American Free Trade Agreement, instead of exporting people, Mexico is now a major exporter of cars, televisions, aircraft parts and other manufactured goods.
Pea Nieto may also be better able to govern than either Caldern or his PAN predecessor, Vicente Fox, whose reformist efforts were invariably blocked by the PRI and P.R.D. in Congress. Not only is the PAN backing the new government's plan to open the ailing oil monopoly, Pemex, to private capital, but the PRI's traditional subservience to its leader should also strengthen Pea Nieto's hand in negotiating with other centers of power.
There is much to be done. Corruption, long associated with PRI rule, has not abated over the past 12 years. Fiscal reform is urgently needed: Mexico has the lowest level of tax revenue in relation to G.D.P. of any O.E.C.D. member. Monopolies flourish, not least the telecommunications empire controlled by Carlos Slim, the world's richest man.
Labor unions, long allied to the PRI, are also now more independent. The Pemex workers' boss, Carlos Romero Deschamps, will expect big payoffs for his members in return for any energy reform. Elba Esther Gordillo, the teachers' union leader since 1989 (and recently re-elected unanimously until 2018), remains the principal obstacle to much-needed modernization of education.
Still, quite the biggest headache inherited by Pea Nieto is the ''war on drugs.'' Caldern claims that a significant number of leading capos have been killed or arrested; he also argues that most of the tens of thousands of dead have been victims of a separate territorial war being waged by competing cartels. But even amid signs that violence may have peaked, domestic support for his strategy has long evaporated.
Today, Mexicans feel they are fighting an American battle on Mexican soil. Caldern estimated that Mexico's cartels earn $20 billion per year from American drug consumers, more than enough to buy sophisticated weaponry north of the border. And after voters in Colorado and Washington State approved recreational use of marijuana this month, it is hard to explain why Mexicans should die to prevent marijuana being smuggled north.
As a candidate, Pea Nieto expressed alarm over the price Mexico is paying for the war on drugs and suggested he could reduce the violence, but he has not spelled out how. (At their meeting in Washington on Tuesday, Pea Nieto and President Obama promised closer cooperation on security issues, but just what this means remains unclear.)
One favorite explanation for the rise of violence since the PRI left office 12 years ago is that party bosses were in league with the drug cartels and that, quite unnecessarily, Caldern stirred up the hornets' nest. In response, Pea Nieto's aides have dismissed any notion of a deal with the capos and have pledged to equip and expand the federal police for a more effective war.
A wiser approach might be to adopt the policy preferred by the two other countries engaged in the most profitable of the drug trades. Neither Colombia, one of the largest cocaine producers, nor the United States, the largest cocaine consumer, is being torn apart by drug-related violence. Both have learned to coexist with the problem, both have opted for containment, both have left Mexico to fight the war.
Pea Nieto's priority is to make Mexico a safer place -- for its citizens, for tourists, for businesses -- and this may only be possible by conceding that narcotics trafficking will continue so long as there is a lucrative market next door. Certainly, if the war slips out of the headlines in the coming months, this will not mean the cartels have been defeated. It will simply mean that the new government is placing Mexico's interests before those of the United States.

HEADLINE: Time for Impatience in Congo

BYLINE: By WILLET WEEKS

 BODY:
NAIROBI -- Cities seized by rebels. Civilians fleeing from their homes. Murders, abductions, rapes, looting. Foreign forces backing insurgents and denying they are doing so. Rumors of other regional powers sending in military support. It sounds like a drama we have watched before.
Sadly, we have, over and over. Since 1994, when Rwandan Hutu refugees fled there, the provinces of North and South Kivu of the Democratic Republic of Congo have been in an uninterrupted state of armed conflict.
From 1998 to 2003, this enormous country was the scene of Africa's first world war, with the armies of at least half a dozen countries blasting away at each other while their commanders filled their pockets.
There are signs that we may be headed be down that path once again. Last week, an insurgent force calling itself the March 23 Movement, or M23, seized control of the city of Goma, in North Kivu. It is now marching toward the key airport of Kavumu, which serves Bukavu, the capital of South Kivu, where Congolese and foreign troops are said to be arriving by the planeload. 
Something must be done quickly, or a series of brutal and inconclusive battles, probably involving countless civilian casualties, is likely to ensue.
Past truces have issued from internationally brokered negotiations that were in reality exchanges of franchises and benefits. None has lasted. On past performance, we're probably heading for yet another of these. Yet there may now also be an opportunity to break the cycle.
(In 2009-2011 I was based in Goma with the consulting firm Development Alternatives Inc. as adviser to the U.S. Agency for International Development on various peace processes.)
Outsiders are understandably baffled. How can this be, I am often asked, with the expectation that I'll say something like it's all about mineral wealth, or it's all about ethnic rivalries, or it's all about how Congo is too big ever to be governed.
Those of us who follow these events closely, year after year, are condemned to take a deep breath and, knowing that eyes will glaze over, to say, well, yes and no, it's a bit of each, but, really, it's all very complicated.
Right now, though, I actually think that a dose of impatience on the part of the international community is in order. It needs to be impatient with the principal actors in this drama, but it needs also to be deeply self-critical, or the past could indeed repeat itself.
Among the myriad localized rivalries, the tent-pole conflict centers on Goma and the business interests that converge there: control of the mineral trade, but also of the trade in food staples and high-value export crops; control of international assistance, including the housing and feeding of aid workers; control of the rich rangeland in the adjacent Masisi hills; conflict over land titles in all these areas and in Goma itself, whose prosperity has been fueled by the war economy; and, implausible as this may sound now, control of a huge potential tourist industry in a city located by an emerald-green mountain lake, surrounded by spectacular volcanoes and adjacent to Virunga National Park, one of Africa's finest game reserves.
Instead of agreeing to compete on business terms, elites from powerful ethnic groups have for decades, in collusion with factions of the Congolese and neighboring governments, been organized into mafias. They have built market share and acquired titles, concessions and licenses from corrupt officials, run protection rackets and ensured that most markets remain black.
During the long collapse of the Mobutu regime in the 1990s these mafias became militarized, a process that accelerated in 1994 when the Rwandan civil war spilled across the border.
Spiraling outward from Goma, smaller local militias have sprung up everywhere in North and South Kivu, preying on populations while claiming to protect their interests. A group whose origins lie in the old, defeated Rwandan army, though much depleted, still roams the countryside.
No level of international pressure is going to eliminate the core business rivalries between elites from the Tutsi, Nande and Mushi ethnic groups, just to mention three of most prominent. Nor will it eradicate their ties to Congolese, Rwandan or Ugandan military and political factions. There is a deep and long game of influence being played here. Non-regional internationals lack the skills, knowledge, wits and commitment to play at that level.
But the international community must nonetheless try to get it right this time. Instead of acting as a broker between interests in a game way over its head, it must make itself the champion of the civilian population, demanding that rivalries be demilitarized; that militias be disarmed; that the hapless and corrupt Congolese national army be reduced to a tiny core of vetted units and rebuilt from scratch; and that the political system be rethought to take into account local aspirations.
This latter point is vital. The present Constitution allows for a measure of decentralized administration but falls short of devolving any real authority. A fully federal system might simply displace the seat of corruption and mafia influence to the provinces, but elected, empowered provincial and local assemblies would be better placed to negotiate and broker local power relations.
As militias have proliferated, rivalries, particularly over land use and tenure and over access to markets, have been turned into existential battles in which local interests can only be protected by armed force. This has suited the elites just fine. A settlement that leaves the militias in place, or that again integrates them haphazardly into the national army, will only perpetuate the current mayhem.
A new political dispensation negotiated with civilian participation would almost surely lead to a measure of federalism and provide a local framework for local issues to be resolved. It has only been in recent decades that armed hysteria has replaced deal-making and compromise.
Implementation of such a deal will be hard, and will require solid assurances that international donor resources will be there to back it up. To succeed, the international community must say, in effect, we're willing to back any reasonable solution as long as it includes rapid demilitarization, as well as meaningful involvement by communities, including women. It must include arrangements for equitable and transparent commercial relations within Congo and with its neighbors. It must promise international-justice action against anyone who works against the agreement by committing abuses. And the United Nations forces must be relieved of their misguided focus on supporting the national army and revert to their previous role as objective policeman.
Such an agreement would take time and effort to implement. But if key international actors can be very impatient now and then patient and steady going forward, the spiral of violence might at last start to unwind.

HEADLINE: A Parched Jordan Places Hopes in Reservoir

BYLINE: By RANA F. SWEIS

 BODY:
AMMAN -- Jordanians took to the streets this summer to protest water shortages and disruptions. Some demonstrators burned tires and blocked roads while others carried empty plastic gallons in the street symbolizing the scarcity of water in their homes.
Jordan is the world's fourth-poorest country in terms of water resources per capita, according to the World Bank. According to U.N. data, 80 percent of Jordanian territory is desert and only 5 percent of its land is considered arable. 
In late summer, the government Water Authority had to hire guards to protect main water wells and infrastructure in remote regions against the theft of pumps and other parts.
''Every village and city in Jordan right now is only receiving water once a week,'' said Basem Telfah, secretary general of the Ministry of Water and Irrigation. ''Some provinces are receiving water once every two or three weeks.''
The water shortage took on an even more urgent aspect this week when the government announced that an anticipated long-term solution, a project that would have extracted 2.15 billion cubic meters, or nearly 570 billion gallons, of water from the Red Sea every year, was to be scaled back because of its high cost, estimated at more than $14 billion.
Against that background, Jordan is betting heavily on a major pipeline, the Disi Water Conveyance Project, which is expected to start carrying water next year to the capital, Amman, from deep underground sources in southern Jordan, which the country shares with Saudi Arabia.
The largest infrastructure project yet undertaken in Jordan, the project will cost an estimated $1.2 billion, according to the Disi project director, Bassam Saleh. But there is a serious drawback: Tests on some wells feeding the Disi pipeline have revealed high levels of radioactivity, raising public concern about the long-term health risks of drinking Disi water.
Government officials, scientists and water experts say they recognize the high levels of radioactivity in the water but they say that with proper treatment this should not pose a threat.
''We have to seriously study the degree of contamination and not lower it in our reports or standards or hide it,'' said Dureid Mahasneh, a former Jordan Valley authority chief.
Mr. Mahasneh said the radiation problem could be treated through a process called ion exchange or by dilution.
Radiation is present in the water in the form of radon, a radioactive, colorless gas, but dissipates when the water is exposed to air on the surface, said Bahjat Al Adwan, the head of the Jordanian Geologists Association.
The first controversy over the Disi project arose in 2009 when a research team of scientists from Jordan, the Palestinian territories, Israel and the United States published a report in the journal Environmental Science & Technology. The report showed high radioactivity in water from 37 wells, used mostly for agriculture, in the Disi area.
Scientists and academics in Amman responded by organizing public discussions on the Disi project. Despite that, several conspiracy theories started to circulate.
People propagating conspiracy theories ''thought the Israelis and the Americans had deceived the Jordanians,'' Mr. Mahasneh said. Still, he said, ''it is known in science that water of deep aquifers in such areas do have radiation.
''We don't like the results, but can we handle it? Yes.''
Measured radiation levels varied from well to well: Water experts and scientists say that more accurate data could be collected once all the 55 wells planned to supply the pipeline have been completed. They also point to the need to measure radiation levels after treatment.
''The question should not be if there is high radiation or not, but if the water is treatable,'' said Elias Salameh, professor of hydrology and hydrochemistry at the University of Jordan in Amman. ''We need to drink water and we have no alternative.''
Most of the Disi aquifer lies under Saudi Arabia, which is already using water from it.
In Aqaba, on Jordan's Red Sea coast, people have also been drinking water from the Disi for almost 20 years, with no apparent increase in the number of cancers.
''There has been no significant record'' of abnormal cancer rates, Mr. Mahasneh said. Still, he added, ''I admit that we need to investigate it further.''
Meanwhile, the need to find additional supplies of water continues to grow more acute.
Jordan receives fewer than 40 days of rain per year on average, according to Mr. Telfah. The Jordanian population is increasing 3. 5 percent a year -- and in the past few months alone the population has ballooned with the arrival of hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees.
The refugees are concentrated mostly in northern Jordan, where one camp alone holds more than 30,000.
The Disi pipeline was first proposed almost a decade ago but was long deemed too expensive. Construction finally began in 2007. Consumers will pay 95 U.S. cents to $1.40 per cubic meter of water.
''As a water expert I am worried'' by the radiation risk, Mr. Mahasneh said. ''But Jordanians are worried about having water or not having water. To be or not to be.''
''Ask everyone in the streets and they are saying, 'Thank God we will have water next year,''' he said.

HEADLINE: Costliest Jet, Years in Making, Sees the Enemy: Budget Cuts

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER DREW

 BODY:
LEXINGTON PARK, Md. -- The Marine version of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, already more than a decade in the making, was facing a crucial question: Could the jet, which can soar well past the speed of sound, land at sea like a helicopter?
On an October day last year, with Lt. Col. Fred Schenk at the controls, the plane glided toward a ship off the Atlantic coast and then, its engine rotating straight down, descended gently to the deck at seven feet a second.
There were cheers from the ship's crew members, who ''were all shaking my hands and smiling,'' Colonel Schenk recalled.
The smooth landing helped save that model and breathed new life into the huge F-35 program, the most expensive weapons system in military history. But while Pentagon officials now say that the program is making progress, it begins its 12th year in development years behind schedule, troubled with technological flaws and facing concerns about its relatively short flight range as possible threats grow from Asia. 
With a record price tag -- potentially in the hundreds of billions of dollars -- the jet is likely to become a target for budget cutters. Reining in military spending is on the table as President Obama and Republican leaders in Congress look for ways to avert a fiscal crisis. But no matter what kind of deal is reached in the next few weeks, military analysts expect the Pentagon budget to decline in the next decade as the war in Afghanistan ends and the military is required to do its part to reduce the federal debt.
Behind the scenes, the Pentagon and the F-35's main contractor, Lockheed Martin, are engaged in a conflict of their own over the costs. The relationship ''is the worst I've ever seen, and I've been in some bad ones,'' Maj. Gen. Christopher Bogdan of the Air Force, a top program official, said in September. ''I guarantee you: we will not succeed on this if we do not get past that.''
In a battle that is being fought on other military programs as well, the Pentagon has been pushing Lockheed to cut costs much faster while the company is fighting to hold onto a profit. ''Lockheed has seemed to be focused on short-term business goals,'' Frank Kendall, the Pentagon's top weapons buyer, said this month. ''And we'd like to see them focus more on execution of the program and successful delivery of the product.''
The F-35 was conceived as the Pentagon's silver bullet in the sky -- a state-of-the art aircraft that could be adapted to three branches of the military, with advances that would easily overcome the defenses of most foes. The radar-evading jets would not only dodge sophisticated antiaircraft missiles, but they would also give pilots a better picture of enemy threats while enabling allies, who want the planes, too, to fight more closely with American forces.
But the ambitious aircraft instead illustrates how the Pentagon can let huge and complex programs veer out of control and then have a hard time reining them in. The program nearly doubled in cost as Lockheed and the military's own bureaucracy failed to deliver on the most basic promise of a three-in-one jet that would save taxpayers money and be served up speedily.
Lockheed has delivered 41 planes so far for testing and initial training, and Pentagon leaders are slowing purchases of the F-35 to fix the latest technical problems and reduce the immediate costs. A helmet for pilots that projects targeting data onto its visor is too jittery to count on. The tail-hook on the Navy jet has had trouble catching the arresting cable, meaning that version cannot yet land on carriers. And writing and testing the millions of lines of software needed by the jets is so daunting that General Bogdan said, ''It scares the heck out of me.''
With all the delays -- full production is not expected until 2019 -- the military has spent billions to extend the lives of older fighters and buy more of them to fill the gap. At the same time, the cost to build each F-35 has risen to an average of $137 million from $69 million in 2001.
The jets would cost taxpayers $396 billion, including research and development, if the Pentagon sticks to its plan to build 2,443 by the late 2030s. That would be nearly four times as much as any other weapons system and two-thirds of the $589 billion the United States has spent on the war in Afghanistan. The military is also desperately trying to figure out how to reduce the long-term costs of operating the planes, now projected at $1.1 trillion.
''The plane is unaffordable,'' said Winslow T. Wheeler, an analyst at the Project on Government Oversight, a nonprofit group in Washington.
Todd Harrison, an analyst at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a research group in Washington, said Pentagon officials had little choice but to push ahead, especially after already spending $65 billion on the fighter. ''It is simultaneously too big to fail and too big to succeed,'' he said. ''The bottom line here is that they've crammed too much into the program. They were asking one fighter to do three different jobs, and they basically ended up with three different fighters.''
While weapons cost overruns have long been a problem, the F-35 is also running into the changing budget realities, and a new focus on rivalry with China, that will probably require shifting money to a broader mix of planes.
Yet, for years, the problems with the F-35 raised few red flags, as money flowed freely after the 2001 terror attacks and enthusiasm for a three-in-one jet blinded officials in the Clinton and Bush administrations and in Congress to its overly ambitious design. Now, unless the Pentagon can substantially reduce the price of each plane, analysts say, it may be lucky to buy 1,200 to 1,800.
Robert J. Stevens, the chief executive of Lockheed Martin, said company officials were ''working as aggressively as we can'' to fix the problems and cut costs. Vice Adm. David Venlet, who now runs the program at the Pentagon, said he was confident that ''good old-fashioned engineering is going to lick'' the flaws. But he declined to predict how many planes would be bought.
''It's a very fair conversation that ought to be had for the country,'' he said.
'Acquisition Malpractice'
Right from the start, Pentagon officials were warned of the dangers of beginning to produce an aircraft before it was tested. And right from the start, Pentagon officials did not listen.
The roots of the problems go back to the mid-1990s, when military officials pitched the F-35 as simple and affordable, like a Chevrolet of the skies, with the three versions sharing 70 to 80 percent of their parts. The planes would also be versatile, capable of fighting other planes but focused mainly on attacking ground targets.
Pentagon officials thought advances in computer modeling would simulate so precisely the way the F-35 would fly that only minor problems would be discovered in the flight tests.
And given a ban on exporting the F-22, the top stealth fighter, moving quickly on the F-35 would lock up foreign buyers and keep Europe from creating its own stealth planes.
''There was this big desire to kill the competition,'' said Richard L. Aboulafia, an analyst at the Teal Group in Fairfax, Va.
Lockheed beat out Boeing for the F-35 contract in October 2001.
Pentagon testing experts and Congressional auditors warned as the program got under way that it would be wiser to ''fly before you buy.'' They cautioned that some of the new technologies were not ready and that years of flight tests would find flaws that the simulations had not anticipated.
Lockheed and the joint Air Force and Navy office that runs the program countered that the sooner they started building a sizable number of planes, the sooner they could realize economies of scale that would lower the price of each plane, even if some needed updating.
But almost immediately, the project proved to be incredibly complicated. Lockheed's initial designs were late and had to be redone, delaying the manufacture of parts for the test models. While most military programs start building before all the testing is done, the Pentagon took that to an extreme, starting production of the F-35s in 2007, before flight tests had even begun.
Mr. Kendall, who became the Pentagon's top weapons buyer in May, has said that diving into production so soon amounted to ''acquisition malpractice.''
Mr. Harrison, the analyst at the budget center, said the willingness to ''roll the dice'' reflected the peculiar incentives at the Pentagon, where rushing into production creates jobs and locks in political support, even if it allows programs to drift into trouble. Lockheed and its suppliers on the F-35 employ 35,000 workers, with some in nearly every Congressional district.
''The military services want to get the planes as quickly as possible,'' Mr. Harrison said. ''The defense industry wants to start producing as quickly as possible. But it's not in the best interest of taxpayers, and it ends up catching up with you.''
Asked who protects the taxpayer, he said, ''That's what the Pentagon's civilian leadership is supposed to bring.''
But with the Iraq and Afghanistan wars raging, Robert M. Gates, who was then the defense secretary, did not deal with the problems with the F-35 until late 2009 and early 2010, when he fired the general in charge and brought in Admiral Venlet, a former fighter pilot who had overseen testing of Navy aircraft. According to the admiral, Mr. Gates said, ''Dave, the program has made small adjustments over the years and persistently disappointed people.''
Then, sweeping his finger in a wide arc, Mr. Gates added, ''If you evaluate that we need a big adjustment, tell me, and I'll make it, so we don't disappoint any more.''
Contractor in the Hot Seat
Admiral Venlet's first move was to bring in technical experts from the services who had been shut out of the program. He said his predecessors had given Lockheed too much leeway earlier, when government oversight was considered ''a hindrance more than a help.''
Another method that he chose to assert control is decidedly low-tech: printouts of charts, hung from whiteboards on all four walls of a ''war room'' in the F-35 offices near the Pentagon.
''It looks maybe a little dinosaurlike,'' he acknowledged, standing near cutout plane shapes tracking the flow of parts into Lockheed's mile-long plant in Fort Worth. ''But you know what? It works.''
Military officials said the testing had picked up substantially at the Patuxent River Naval Air Station here and other bases, where the planes have already flown near their top speeds of Mach 1.6. Still, the overlap between testing and production remains a serious problem, and the extra cost of refitting planes built while the flight tests are under way could reach $2.4 billion to $3.8 billion, Admiral Venlet said.
Lockheed has already lost profits, earning only $28 million of a possible $87.5 million in award fees for meeting development goals in 2010 and 2011. In tense negotiations over the latest batch, the Pentagon has been demanding that the company shoulder some of the costs of fixing the problems found in the tests.
''It should not take 10, 11, 12 months to negotiate a contract with someone we've been doing business with for 11 years,'' General Bogdan said.
The general started as Admiral Venlet's deputy in August, and he will succeed him next week. His criticism startled Lockheed officials, because in his last job, overseeing the award of a $35 billion contract for aerial refueling tankers, Boeing gave the Air Force such a good price that analysts think Boeing is subsidizing the early work.
Lockheed argues that the government's estimates of what the F-35s should cost now are too low and that the program was far riskier than the military said it would be. Only 20 to 30 percent of the structural parts ended up in common, though the models will share engines and software. Lockheed officials also noted that commercial plane makers had run into delays with their most innovative planes, Boeing's 787 Dreamliner and Airbus's A350.
Mr. Stevens, the Lockheed chief executive, said military programs bog down in many layers of auditing, a process he described as ''sclerosis in the system.'' In World War II, he said, ''We managed to either invent or refine jet propulsion, nuclear weapons, radar, radio communication, electronics in three years and eight months.'' In that time today, he said, the Pentagon cannot even finish the initial design of a system.
Lockheed is fixing the most glaring problems. A support wall in the fuselage of the Marine version -- the only one that can land like a helicopter -- was strengthened after it cracked in a test in 2010. The tail-hook on the Navy model was just seven feet behind the landing gear, much closer than on other Navy planes. After the wheels flattened the arresting cable, the cable did not bounce up quickly enough for the hook to grab it. Lockheed is reshaping the hook to try to scoop up the cable.
But the ''gorilla in the room,'' General Bogdan said, is testing and securing the 24 million lines of software code for the plane and its support systems, a mountain of instructions that goes far beyond what has been tried in any plane.
Under the latest plan, Lockheed will be held to about 30 planes in each of the next two years. But the Pentagon will still have bought 365 planes before the flight tests end in 2017.
Two years ago, General Bogdan said, the F-35 program was like an aircraft carrier that ''was going to run aground.'' But if the military and Lockheed can ''hold each other accountable,'' he said, ''we've got a shot at getting this done.''
Rough Skies Ahead
With the budget problems at home, Pentagon and Lockheed officials are looking to allies to help pay for the F-35. They have stepped up phone calls and visits, trying to reassure the eight countries that have invested in the program, as well as persuading two others, Israel and Japan, to sign up.
Lockheed needs more foreign orders to realize volume savings and get closer to the Pentagon's targets of $79 million to $106 million a plane, depending on the model. But to get those orders, said Mr. Aboulafia, the Teal Group analyst, Lockheed must be more aggressive in cutting its prices, especially since the allies have their own economic difficulties.
This year, Italy cut its planned order 30 percent. Britain and Australia have delayed decisions on how many F-35s to buy. Lawmakers in Canada and the Netherlands are questioning the costs.
And while Congress continues to support the F-35, the leaders of the Senate Armed Services Committee are concerned that production is now set to ramp up later in this decade just as two other major projects -- the refueling tankers and a $55 billion stealth bomber program -- will seek financing.
On top of that, the F-35 could be too sophisticated for minor conflicts, and its relatively short flight range could be a problem as the Pentagon changes its view of possible threats. Mark Gunzinger, a retired Air Force colonel who is now an analyst at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, said the Pentagon would need to shift money to longer-range planes as China and other countries expanded the reach of missiles capable of destroying American ships and bases.
The Navy is developing a stealthy unmanned fighter that could fly from carriers and go two or three times as far as the F-35. The Air Force is studying concepts for the bomber, which could fly much farther and carry more firepower than the F-35.
Representative Norm Dicks of Washington, the top Democrat on the House defense appropriations subcommittee, said support for the F-35 could also dwindle if lawmakers faced tougher choices between military and domestic programs. ''Anything where there are still issues hanging out is going to be vulnerable to some extent,'' he said.
The Next War: Articles in this series are examining the American military and the decisions confronting it in a new age of austerity.

HEADLINE: End Federal Flood Insurance

BYLINE: By JUDITH KILDOW and JASON SCORSE. 
Judith Kildow directs the National Ocean Economics Program at the Monterey Institute of International Studies, a graduate school of Middlebury College. Jason Scorse is an associate professor of economics at the institute and directs its Center for the Blue Economy.

 BODY:
Monterey, Calif.
IT'S no surprise that it can be very expensive to live near the ocean. But it may come as a surprise to American taxpayers that they are on the hook for at least $527 billion of vulnerable assets in the nation's coastal flood plains. Those homes and businesses are insured by the federal government's National Flood Insurance Program.
You read that right: $527 billion, which is just a portion of the program's overall liability of $1.25 trillion, second only to Social Security in the liabilities on the government's ledgers last year, according to government data. 
The flood insurance program was created by Congress in 1968 to fill a void: because of the risk, few carriers provided flood insurance. Now, private insurers offer flood insurance in a partnership with the government -- but taxpayers shoulder all the risk. It has turned out to be a bad bet. The program is $18 billion in debt, a sum the government acknowledges probably will never be paid back by premiums, and it is likely to need a new multibillion-dollar infusion to pay claims from Hurricane Sandy. It is long past time for the government to stop subsidizing home and business owners who live and build in dangerous flood zones.
Homeowners and businesses should be responsible for purchasing their own flood insurance on the private market, if they can find it. If they can't, then the market is telling them that where they live is too dangerous. If they choose to live in harm's way, they should bear the cost of that risk -- not the taxpayers. Government's primary role is ensuring the safety of its citizens, so the government's subsidizing of risky behavior is completely backward.
Between 1978 and 2011, the program, which is run by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, paid out more than $24 billion in claims in the coastal flood plain. Total losses paid out for Hurricane Katrina alone exceeded $16 billion. FEMA says it is too soon to say how many claims will be filed for Hurricane Sandy-related damages, although The New York Times reported this month that early estimates suggest that this storm will rank as the second worst for claims paid out, with the cost possibly reaching $7 billion -- at a time when the program is allowed, by law, to add only $3 billion to its debt.
The bottom line is that the flood insurance program is a fiscal time bomb for the government.
We should phase out the program, begin thinking strategically about how to shift populations away from the most risky coastal areas, and use the best available science to update the woefully out-of-date coastal-zone risk profiles that government agencies currently rely on to determine danger. We also need to encourage more stringent building codes that take into account the full range of climate risks. (Officials in New York and New Jersey this week estimated the overall costs of Hurricane Sandy in the two states at a combined $72 billion.)
Two major reinsurers, Munich Re and Swiss Re, have strict building codes for policies in coastal areas and will not insure properties in high-risk zones. Florida now self-insures for hurricane wind damage, and has the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund for insurers whose funds are exhausted. The program is financed by a surcharge on all homeowner and commercial insurance policies, but because of the potential for huge liabilities in a future storm, the program might fall short of the money it would need.
We do not underestimate the complexity and political difficulty of phasing out a popular program like national flood insurance, nor do we think the government should abandon people who are currently insured. But Congress and the president should challenge the status quo and make some tough decisions, like providing subsidies or buyouts to encourage people to move out of the most disaster-prone areas, and eliminating other government incentives that support living in high-risk areas.
Some Americans want to live as close to their beloved coasts as they can, but coastal landowners should pay the full cost of living in these dangerous areas. In this climate-constrained world our quality of life will take some hits. But with careful planning and a gradual shift away from the coast, Americans can still enjoy the beauty and live safely, yet escape the cycle of catastrophe and response, in which so much money is expended on properties that are repeatedly flooded.

HEADLINE: Shares Close Higher on Hope of Fiscal Accord

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The stock market closed higher on Wednesday, shrugging off an early loss, on signs that lawmakers in Washington were closer to a deal that would help the United States avoid a potentially damaging year-end package of tax increases and government spending cuts. 
The actions will take effect automatically on Jan. 1 if no deal on the federal budget is reached, possibly pushing the country back into recession. President Obama said he believed both parties could reach a ''framework'' on a debt-cutting deal before Christmas, while John Boehner, the House speaker, told reporters that he was optimistic that a deal could be reached.
Craig Johnson, a technical market strategist at Piper Jaffray, said lawmakers realized that there was too much at stake to allow the deadline to pass.
''I don't think that anybody in Washington is going to do something so draconian, or so negative, that we're going to trigger a recession,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''There will be some compromise.''
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 106.98 points, or 0.8 percent, at 12,985.11 after being down as much as 112 points in early trading.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 10.99 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,409.93. The Nasdaq composite index rose 23.99 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,991.78.
Investors' concerns that a continuing fiscal impasse in Washington will hurt the American economy has weighed on stocks since the Nov. 6 elections maintained a divided government, with Democrats in control of the White House and the Senate and Republicans in control of the House.
Uncertainty about a possible increase in capital gains taxes has been prompting investors to sell stocks to lock in gains ahead of Jan. 1, Mr. Johnson said.
''We're all on pins and needles waiting for every bit of news, or rumors, coming out of Washington,'' said Ryan Detrick, a technical analyst at Schaeffer's Investment Research. ''That's what Wall Street is focused on. Everybody is watching the fiscal cliff.''
Many companies are making special end-of-year dividend payments or moving up their quarterly payouts because investors appear likely to pay higher taxes on dividend income starting in 2013.
Costco, the wholesale club operator, surged $6.07, or 6.3 percent, to $102.58 after the company said it would pay a special dividend of $7 a share next month, in addition to its regular quarterly dividend. Las Vegas Sands rose 5.3 percent on Tuesday after the casino operator said it would distribute about $2.26 billion to shareholders before the end of the year. It rose another 1.3 percent on Wednesday, gaining 60 cents to $49.96.
With the stock market's attention focused on the outcome of the fiscal negotiations, some investors cautioned that the weakness in third-quarter corporate earnings bode poorly for stocks.
Company earnings fell 0.9 percent in the third quarter, the data provider FactSet said in a report on Nov. 23. If corporate earnings finish the period lower, it would be the first decline in three years.
In the bond market, interest rates slipped. The price of the Treasury's 10-year note rose 2/32, to 99 30/32, while its yield fell to 1.63 percent, from 1.64 percent late Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Law School Is Worth The Money

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE E. MITCHELL. 
Lawrence E. Mitchell is dean of Case Western Reserve University's law school.

 BODY:
I'M a law dean, and I'm proud. And I think it's time to stop the nonsense. After two years of almost relentless attacks on law schools, a bit of perspective would be nice.
For at least two years, the popular press, bloggers and a few sensationalist law professors have turned American law schools into the new investment banks. We entice bright young students into our academic clutches. Succubus-like, when we've taken what we want from them, we return them to the mean and barren streets to fend for themselves.
The hysteria has masked some important realities and created an environment in which some of the brightest potential lawyers are, largely irrationally, forgoing the possibility of a rich, rewarding and, yes, profitable, career. 
The starting point is the job market. It's bad. It's bad in many industries. ''Bad,'' in law, means that most students will have trouble finding a first job, especially at law firms. But a little historical perspective will reveal that the law job market has been bad -- very bad -- before. To take the most recent low before this era, in 1998, 55 percent of law graduates started in law firms. In 2011, that number was 50 percent. A 9 percent decline from a previous low during the worst economic conditions in decades hardly seems catastrophic. And this statistic ignores the other jobs lawyers do.
Even so, the focus on first jobs is misplaced. We educate students for a career likely to span 40 to 50 years. The world is guaranteed to change in unpredictable ways, but that reality doesn't keep us from planning our lives. Moreover, the career for which we educate students, done through the medium of the law, is a career in leadership and creative problem solving. Many graduates will find that their legal educations give them the skills to find rich and rewarding lives in business, politics, government, finance, the nonprofit sector, the arts, education and more.
What else will these thousands of students who have been discouraged from attending law school do? Where will they find a more fulfilling career? They're not all going to be doctors or investment bankers, nor should they. Looking purely at the economics, in 2011, the median starting salary for practicing lawyers was $61,500; the mean salary for all practicing lawyers was $130,490, compared with $176,550 for corporate chief executives, $189,210 for internists and $79,300 for architects. This average includes many lawyers who graduated into really bad job markets. And the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics reports projected growth in lawyers' jobs from 2010 to 2020 at 10 percent, ''about as fast as the average for all occupations.''
It's true, and a problem, that tuition has increased. One report shows that tuition at private schools increased about 160 percent from 1985 to 2011. Private medical school tuition increased only 63 percent during that period. But, in 1985, medical school already cost four times more than law school. And starting salaries for law graduates have increased by 125 percent over that period.
Debt, too, is a problem. The average student at a private law school graduates with $125,000 in debt. But the average lawyer's annual salary exceeds that number. You'd consider a home mortgage at that ratio to be pretty sweet.
Investment in tuition is for a lifelong career, not a first job. There are many ways to realize a satisfactory return on this investment. Even practicing law appears to have paid off over the long term.
The graying of baby-boom lawyers creates opportunities. As more senior lawyers retire, jobs will open, even in the unlikely case that the law business doesn't expand with an improving economy. More opportunity will open to women and minorities, too. As with any industry in transition, changes in the delivery of legal services create opportunities as well as challenges. Creative, innovative and entrepreneurial lawyers will find ways to capitalize on this.
The overwrought atmosphere has created irrationalities that prevent talented students from realizing their ambitions. Last spring we accepted an excellent student with a generous financial-aid package that left her with the need to borrow only $5,000 a year. She told us that she thought it would be ''irresponsible'' to borrow the money. She didn't attend any law school. I think that was extremely shortsighted, but this prevailing attitude discourages bright students from attending law school.
We could do things better, and every law school with which I'm familiar is looking to address its problems. In the meantime, the one-sided analysis is inflicting significant damage, not only on law schools but also on a society that may well soon find itself bereft of its best and brightest lawyers.

HEADLINE: Children Subsidize 'Low, Low' Prices

BYLINE: By KJ DELL'ANTONIA

 BODY:
Part of our national antipoverty strategy over the last few decades has been to increase employment, particularly among mothers. But jobs with a lack of benefits, inflexible hours and often nonstandard shifts exacerbate low pay, leaving parents little time with their children and even less money for high-quality substitutes for that time. 
As a result, according to the Boston College sociologist Lisa Dodson and Randy Albelda, an economist at the University of Massachusetts, Boston, adolescents from households headed by a low-income worker are more likely to drop out of school, to be obese and to take on adult roles too young. In providing child care for siblings and forgoing opportunities that require an engaged parent, teenage children in low-wage families are, Drs. Dodson and Albelda argue, effectively subsidizing their parents' employment.
Without the chance to cultivate their own talents, many of these teenagers will play out the low-wage job cycle with their own children. That's good for creating a nation of low-wage (retail and service) workers, and bad for the American tradition of helping each generation to do better than the one before. KJ DELL'ANTONIA

HEADLINE: Split on Business Views in Race for Mayor

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
It was a simple question, posed by one of New York's most prominent business leaders at an economic forum with an audience of hundreds: What would you do as mayor to keep business confident about the city's progress?
But the replies, offered by four presumptive Democratic mayoral candidates gathered at a Midtown hotel on Wednesday, illuminated a sharp divide in the race to succeed Michael R. Bloomberg. 
Bill de Blasio, the public advocate and a frequent critic of the Bloomberg administration, disputed the question's basic premise, saying ''continuity'' is not necessarily desirable. ''We're not on the right track for the economic future,'' he said bluntly, citing concerns about income disparity and a surfeit of regulations that he said had stymied small businesses. ''The status quo,'' he added later, ''is unacceptable.''
Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker and an ally of Mayor Bloomberg, was more uncritically enthusiastic. Calling herself ''very optimistic,'' she praised the mayor -- along with the Council she leads -- for promoting a resilient business climate amid a world-shaking recession. New York, she said, ''weathered this storm better than any other city in America.''
Continuity, or change? To build on Mr. Bloomberg's legacy, or to go back and revise it? These were the underlying themes that emerged from an hour's worth of discussion among the candidates -- including John C. Liu, the comptroller, and William C. Thompson Jr., a former comptroller -- as they tackled hurricane relief, tax policy and the travails of small businesses at an event sponsored by Crain's New York Business and Partnership for New York City.
Ms. Quinn called for extending the economic policies of the past few years and expanding the tax credits and regulatory reforms she has spearheaded. Mr. de Blasio countered that business owners felt ''a profound sense of insecurity'' and that they considered many city agencies unhelpful.
Ms. Quinn advocated, forcefully, for a renewed embrace of the city's battered waterfront, and challenged New Yorkers to install modern antiflooding technology ''and really show the Netherlands and London how to do it.'' Mr. De Blasio more dourly described the storm as a warning ''that we need to approach our coastlines very differently.''
The other candidates offered their own objections to the idea of Bloomberg 2.0. Mr. Thompson pointedly insisted that the next mayor, who will presumably not be a billionaire, recognize that the city has five boroughs, not just Manhattan, and govern accordingly. He said the city's pension fund should invest in more businesses owned by minorities and women.
Mr. Liu, a strong ally of labor who has had an uneasy relationship with the city's business elite, acknowledged at one point that ''there are probably a lot of perceptions about me in this room.'' But he also offered the most extreme vision of change, essentially insisting that the city reduce its oversight of small businesses. At one point, he proposed an unequivocal end to public subsidies for businesses.
The event's moderator, Kathryn S. Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, made clear that the 2013 mayoral race greatly concerns the business community.
''There is consternation about the post-Bloomberg era,'' she said in her opening remarks, calling Mr. Bloomberg ''one of us'' and noting that he had been ''sympathetic to issues of the economy and business.''
Ms. Quinn has cultivated a strong relationship with business groups. At the event on Wednesday, Mr. Liu and Mr. Thompson each emphasized his experience in the private sector.
The candidates will face off in a primary next year, probably in September. In November, the Democratic nominee will face a Republican -- that party's probable contenders thus far include Adolfo Carrin Jr., a former Bronx borough president who is switching his party affiliation; Tom Allon, a newspaper publisher who switched his affiliation last month; and George T. McDonald, a founder of the Doe Fund, who also switched parties. The city's voters are overwhelmingly Democratic, and the Democratic candidates are far better-known than the Republicans, but a Democrat has not been elected mayor since 1989.

HEADLINE: Despite Powerball Odds, A Mad Rush to the Registers

BYLINE: By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON; Reporting was contributed by Jess Bidgood in Boston, Ian Lovett in Los Angeles, Dan Frosch in Denver, Steven Yaccino in Chicago, Kia Gregory in New York and David Thier in Slidell, La.

 BODY:
NEW ORLEANS -- All across this recession-weary country on Wednesday, Americans of every rank and station lined up at convenience stores and delis, placed their hard-earned dollars on countertops and took part in a venerated national tradition: trying to get really rich without doing anything.
''You want to retire tomorrow?'' Vijay Patel asked his customers at Lanzilli's Groceria in East Boston, where Powerball tickets were constantly being churned out by the lottery machines. ''A lot of action today. Good luck.'' 
At $579.9 million, the Powerball jackpot on Wednesday was the second-largest lottery jackpot in United States history. In March, the Mega Millions prize was $656 million, which was and still is, in the words of Michael Jones, the superintendent of the Illinois Lottery, the ''largest lottery prize in the history of the solar system.''
Both of these sums are of such a scale that they seem to muddle a person's ability to calculate probabilities. A woman in Denver bought $450 in tickets on Tuesday. People in Nevada, which does not participate in Powerball, have been calling the Arizona Last Stop, a bar/restaurant/gas station right across the state line, to ask about sending busloads of ticket buyers from Las Vegas.
On Wednesday alone, Floridians had spent more than $10 million by 2 p.m. on Powerball tickets. So many people had bought tickets nationwide, said David Bishop, a spokesman for the Florida Lottery, that there was a 75 percent chance that one or more of the combinations picked will match the combination drawn on Wednesday night. The winning numbers were 5, 16, 22, 23, 29, and a Powerball of 6.
Most of the buyers interviewed on Wednesday acknowledged that their chances were not especially good.
A standard practice in news media coverage is to compare lottery odds unfavorably with odds of dying in peculiar ways (shark attack, lightning), but even that morbid exercise does not do justice to the long shot. The odds of picking the winning numbers in Wednesday's drawing were longer than the odds of picking an American man completely at random and having him happen to be Alan Alda.
Granted, the odds are slightly better than they were last year. This year, the officials who oversee Powerball, a game consisting of five numbered white balls and one red ball, reduced the number of red balls to 35 from 39. They also doubled the price of a ticket to $2, but the increase in the size of the jackpot has apparently overcome any sticker shock from the new, higher-priced tickets. There is math, and there is wishful thinking. The contest between the two is not even close.
''It only takes one to win,'' said Katherine Scott, amid the lunch-hour traffic at a 7-Eleven in Chicago. ''I bought two.''
Ken Menno, who has been buying Powerball tickets every week for years, bought five on Wednesday morning at a Shell station in Denver.
''If I win, I'm going to buy this joint,'' he said. ''And send everyone here on a vacation.''
Lines were particularly long in places that sat just over the line from the few states that do not participate in Powerball, places like the Purple Cow convenience store in Slidell, La., a few minutes' drive from Mississippi.
And some people seem to have decided that certain stores are just luckier than others.
One of the three winning tickets from the $656 million Mega Millions prize was sold at the MotoMart convenience store in Red Bud, Ill., about an hour southeast of St. Louis. The electronic marquee outside on Wednesday read ''Lightning can strike twice!'' which is inarguable. Enough people believed it could strike twice at this MotoMart that the store doubled the number of working staff members to accommodate the rush.
''It's constant traffic,'' said Denise Metzger, the manager. She declined to release her sales numbers because they were so high she feared she would be robbed.
Some buyers, like Katie Flom, 28, who works at an advertising agency in Chicago, still had rather ill-formed ideas of what to do with all of that money.
''I'd first buy a plane ticket somewhere warm and then figure it out from there,'' she said.
But she appeared to be in the minority.
Despite the long odds and the cautionary tales about past winners, most people knew exactly what they would do, the bills they would pay, the student debt they would retire, the charity they would start or the car they would finally send to the dump.
Outside the Viva Deli in East Harlem in New York, Manny Colon talked of buying his two daughters a house and setting aside college tuition for grandchildren and great-grandchildren. ''They're the ones that are coming up,'' said Mr. Colon, a retired doorman, smiling at his wife of 61 years. ''We're all right.''
His wife, Gloria, nodded. Then, she added: ''I would like to go to Hawaii.''

HEADLINE: Golf Acts To Ban Anchored Putting

BYLINE: By KAREN CROUSE

 BODY:
THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. -- Mark Cokewell's long putters were leaned against a golf bag on the practice green at Sherwood Country Club here like Douglas firs stacked against the fence of a Christmas tree lot on Dec. 26.
At this time last year, the Krutch II putters from Rosemark Golf, the company Cokewell founded, were selling briskly. But a ruling on Wednesday by golf's governing bodies has turned the clubs into fool's gold.
The United States Golf Association, acting in concert with the Royal & Ancient, proposed a new rule, Rule 14-1b, which states that in making a stroke with any club, players cannot intentionally anchor the club on any part of the body or use their gripping hands to rest against the body.
In a conference call with reporters, Mike Davis, the executive director of the association, said that this was not an equipment ban but a clarification of what constitutes a stroke. ''This is a playing rule,'' he said, ''not an equipment rule.'' 
The proposed rule would allow the continued use of all conforming golf clubs, including belly-length and long putters, as long as they are not anchored during a stroke. The intent, Davis said, is to preserve golfers' abilities to play a wide variety of strokes in their individual style and the integrity of the game.
The governing bodies presented examples of how long putters could still be legally used, including the stroke of Matt Kuchar in which he rests the shaft on his forearm and clasps the putter with his other hand.
''We believe a player should hold the club away from his body and swing it freely, whether it's a putt, a chip, a pitch, a bunker shot, an iron shot, a recovery shot or a shot played from the teeing ground,'' he said. ''We think this is integral to the traditions of the game.''
Before making a final decision on the proposed rule, which would take effect in 2016, the U.S.G.A. and the Royal & Ancient will entertain feedback from those in the golf community for the next three months.
''We believe we have considered this issue from every angle,'' said Peter Dawson, the chief executive of the Royal & Ancient. ''But given the wide-ranging interest in this subject, we would like to give stakeholders in the game the opportunity to put forward any new matters for consideration.''
Three of the past five men's majors were won with players using long putters, a generic description that covers belly putters and the longer broomstick models. The sport's governing bodies were moved to act as the evidence mounted that the club was popular not only with players on the Champions Tour who were struggling with short putts or injuries, but also with stars on the PGA Tour and rising juniors in emerging golf countries like China.
Davis said that 15 percent of the players on the PGA Tour used an anchored putter this year, up from 11 percent last year and 6 percent from 2006 to 2010. He also noted that instructors had been increasingly advocating anchored putting.
But Dawson emphasized that proposing the change was ''not performance-related,'' saying it was difficult to gain meaningful performance data.
''This is about defining the game and defining what is a stroke in golf,'' he said.
Steve Stricker, considered one of the better putters on tour, was in favor of the ban.
Even though none of the players ranked in the top 20 on the PGA Tour in strokes gained putting use a long putter, Stricker said he considered it ''a huge advantage'' to be able to anchor the putter against the body, but realized not everybody felt the same way.
''There's going to be a lot of upset people, a lot of guys that have putted with a long putter for a long time, and I have a feeling they're going to have something to say about that rule,'' he said.
Among those expressing disappointment at the ruling is the P.G.A. of America, which conducted a recent poll in which nearly two-thirds of the respondents said they did not favor the ban because they believe it will have a negative impact on the game's growth.
Asked about possible litigation, Dawson said: ''We believe very strongly that the governing bodies have the authority to make these changes. Once we've decided we've done the right thing, we're ready to defend it all the way.''
Keegan Bradley and Webb Simpson, two of the players to win majors using an anchored putter, said Tuesday they were committed to adapting their strokes to follow the proposed rule and did not plan on contesting the change. Tim Clark, another golfer who uses the long putter, has suggested litigation as a possibility if anchored putting was banned. Clark has a medical condition that does not allow him to rotate his hands, making it a physical struggle to use a conventional putter.
Cokewell, a pilot for Delta Air Lines and an avid golfer, was shooting regularly in the low 80s while taking 39 to 40 putts, so he tapped into his engineering background to solve his putting woes.
After two years of tinkering and 13 submissions of blueprints to U.S.G.A. officials for approval, a result was a club that measured 52 inches -- 20 inches longer than the longest conventional putter. It had a longer and thicker grip and a mallet-style head, and it was designed to be anchored in the armpit and swung like a pendulum.
With his putter finally ready to launch, Cokewell said he went to a rules conference in Vancouver, British Columbia, in November 2010 attended by officials from the U.S.G.A., the Royal & Ancient and clubmakers. ''The issue of the long putters came up, and the U.S.G.A. and the Royal & Ancient said they didn't have any plan in the near future to make a rule change,'' Cokewell said.
He added, ''If they had said they were seriously reviewing it, I obviously would have held off on going forward with my putters.''
In 2011, Cokewell introduced his line of long putters. Sales were good, he said, and they picked up after Adam Scott, Bradley and Simpson won PGA Tour events in consecutive weeks in August. Bradley's victory came at the P.G.A. Championship, making him the first men's player to win a major using an anchored putter.
''I thought my timing was perfect,'' Cokewell said, adding, ''It's been a tough market even at that with the way the economy's been.''
But this year top players like Tiger Woods expressed disapproval of long putters, and Cokewell said sales of his putters at golf retail stores began to drop precipitously.
In recent weeks, Cokewell said, two golfing buddies had expressed interest in becoming investors for the company. They met Wednesday at Sherwood Country Club, site of this week's World Challenge, hosted by Woods.
One investor said he was optimistic Cokewell's grips would remain an attractive selling point; another expressed reservations. The three men were standing on the practice green when Fred Couples, who uses a long putter, walked past.
''Hey, Fred, want to buy a putter?'' Cokewell said. ''I have a one-half-off sale going on as of this morning.''

HEADLINE: Looking to Fill Movie Seats

BYLINE: By JESSICA BRUDER

 BODY:
Sean Wycliffe knew "The King's Speech" had gotten rave reviews. So when he arrived at the theater about two years ago, he was surprised by what he saw. "It was a great movie, but the place was just empty," he said. "It had 230 or 240 seats, but there was me and a couple and that was it."
Mr. Wycliffe had just completed his bachelor's degree in economics at the University of California, Berkeley. Midway through, he'd taken time off to start a small marketing firm with his brother. Now he hankered to build something new. 
He found himself thinking about Hotwire and Priceline, the discount sites he'd used for several years to book hotel rooms that would otherwise go unoccupied. "What if we could partner with theaters and help them fill their seats in the same way?" he wondered. Moviegoers would pay for discounted tickets, specifying the film, the approximate time of day and the neighborhood. After completing a purchase, they would learn the exact showtime and theater.
Mr. Wycliffe incorporated Dealflicks last year. He started working full-time on the project in January along with two co-founders and they introduced a beta site in July.
Co-Founders: Mr. Wycliffe, 29, is the chief executive officer. Kevin Hong, 27, is the vice president of sales, and Zachary Cancio, 25, the chief technology officer.
Employees: Dealflicks has one full-time employee, a business development manager who started out as the company's summer intern. Two more - a designer and a software engineer - are expected to come onboard soon.
Location: Dealflicks moved in October from Mr. Wycliffe's Oakland apartment to Mountain View, Calif.
Pitch: "Dealflicks is like Priceline.com or Hotwire.com, but for movie theaters," Mr. Wycliffe said. "Right now about 88 percent of seats are empty on average. We partner with movie theaters and help them do marketing to fill these empty seats. Our deals are usually tickets - or tickets and popcorn, tickets and soda, that kind of thing - at up to 60 percent off." From that discounted price, Dealflicks typically takes a 10-percent cut, though agreements vary by individual partners.
Traction:Dealflicks has contracted with 62 movie theaters so far. First to sign on was the Gardena Cinema in Los Angeles County. Mr. Hong wooed its Korean owners by bringing them his mother's homemade pajun scallion pancakes.
While trying to build a primary base of theaters in the Bay Area, Dealflicks has also inked deals with partners in Arizona, Georgia, Massachusetts, New York, Ohio, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin.
This fall, Dealflicks won a slot in the accelerator run by 500 Startups, a seed fund and program for early-stage ventures created by Dave McClure, a former PayPal executive. The relationship developed after Mr. Wycliffe and his co-founders attended Unsexy, a conference for companies that are promising but unlikely to set pulses racing in Silicon Valley. At the conference, they talked to every 500 Startups alumni they could find.
"Then when walking out of an auditorium, we literally stumbled upon some dude coding on the floor. That dude turned out to be the C.T.O. of LivingSocial, Aaron Batalion," Mr. Cancio wrote on his blog. "But neither Sean nor I realized who he was at the time. Like a scout, I surreptitiously looked at his name badge. I muttered a quiet suggestion to Sean and before I knew it, Sean marched up to Aaron and introduced himself." That chance meeting wasn't all it took to get into the accelerator -- but it helped.
Revenue: So far, Dealflicks has sold a couple of hundred tickets, according to Mr. Wycliffe, who said total revenue has not yet passed the single-digit thousands. "But the growth is there," he said. "This month, we've sold more than in the previous three months combined." The company issued its first paychecks on Nov. 15.
Financing: Dealflicks has raised $115,000. Friends and family put in about $65,000. The remaining $50,000 came from 500 Startups. The company is seeking $250,000 in angel investments.
Marketing: The company holds parties at college campuses to get the word out. ("Dealflicks just hooked us up with a keg!!!" one Berkley student announced on the company's Facebook page.) It also focused on search engine optimization, working to rank high in Google searches when users hunt for ticket deals. They've partnered with several larger sites that take a commission for driving sales their way. And they've also scored appearances on a couple of Bay Area television news affiliates.
Competition: Movietickets.com and Fandango are the Goliaths of the online ticketing space. "They're great but they're different than what we do because they only sell full-price tickets, and they charge a convenience fee as well," Mr. Wycliffe said. Entrants in the discount space are more of a wild card; five or six of them have come and gone in the last couple of years, he said. One contender, MoviePass, offers unlimited theater trips for a monthly fee. (In a sector that loves analogies, it aims to be the "Netflix of movie theaters.")
Being "unsexy," Mr. Wycliffe believes, "is kind of good in a way, because in Silicon Valley, everyone's focused on that next, next thing. They're looking at video on-demand and social networks. Most are not focused on the movie theater industry."
Challenge: Can Dealflicks convince a critical mass of cinemaphiles to trade their ability to pick an exact time and theater for a cheaper ticket? Building the customer base is essential to attracting more theaters that, in turn, could attract more customers.
"Eventually, we'll need to partner with some of the top chains to grow the business," Mr. Wycliffe said. "For now, it's about getting to the point where we have more and more theaters, and we're filling up all of these empty seats."

HEADLINE: Sundance Unveils Its Hopefuls

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES - Sundance, known for championing dark and inscrutable films, has unveiled an unusually accessible - and sellable - competition lineup.
On Wednesday programmers for the 2013 Sundance Film Festival released the list of features and documentaries that will compete for grand jury and audience prizes in Park City, Utah, in January. And in the esoteric department there are a few doozies, including Shane Carruth's "Upstream Color," a metaphorical drama described as the story of a man and woman "entangled in the life cycle of an ageless organism."
But the competition lineup also brims with comedy: "Austenland," from a writer of "Napoleon Dynamite," pokes fun at Jane Austen fans, while "C.O.G." adapts a David Sedaris work. And the selections are packed with familiar movie and TV stars. Jessica Biel, Daniel Radcliffe, Rooney Mara, Jane Lynch, Jennifer Coolidge, Casey Affleck, Kristen Bell, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Ellen Page and Octavia Spencer (among others) all perform in competition films. 
In a joint interview John Cooper, Sundance's director, and Trevor Groth, the festival's programming chief, cautioned against scrutinizing their lineup too carefully for trends, noting that they are at mercy of what gets submitted. And "accessible" is a relative concept, they noted; these selections are aimed squarely at an art house crowd and not a broad multiplex audience. A big hit in Sundance's world means movies like "Beasts of the Southern Wild," which played in competition last year and took in $11.2 million at the box office.
"Over all, the quality of independent film is getting better and better each year," Mr. Cooper said. "The industry is healthy enough for people - actors, directors, producers, casting directors - to sustain themselves in careers."
Both men pointed to forces inside and outside the festival that are contributing to competition films that are more audience friendly, starting with the creation in 2010 of a Sundance category called Next. Devoted to more experimental, low-budget fare, Next has absorbed some pictures that would have previously been slotted in the competition. This year Next includes unusual movies like "Escape From Tomorrow," a hallucinogenic drama about a father's mental breakdown.
Changing distribution models also play a role. In the past a theatrical and DVD release was the only real option for Sundance films to get seen beyond the festival. But the rise of video on demand, both on television and online, has provided additional exposure for the films and made stars more willing to participate. At the same time filmmakers have adapted by embracing stories that are more palatable - more clearly defined stories, lighter topics - to a V.O.D. audience.
"Sundance seems to have smartly focused more intently on programming not only for artistic quality but also for consumer accessibility," said Kevin Iwashina, managing partner of Preferred Content, a movie production, sales and advisory company. "That in turn guarantees that the festival will impact culture beyond its 10-day run."
The jackpot for filmmakers, of course, remains finding theatrical distribution, and so Sundance is typically judged - to the chagrin of its founder, Robert Redford - by how much money distributors like Fox Searchlight are willing to spend on selections that are for sale, which is almost all of them.
This year two competition films in particular are generating advance buzz. David Lowery's cinematic "Ain't Them Bodies Saints" is a potential critical darling. Telling the story of a Texas outlaw and his wife, it stars Ms. Mara, Mr. Affleck, Keith Carradine and Ben Foster ("3:10 to Yuma").
"Kill Your Darlings," from the producer Christine Vachon ("Boys Don't Cry") and first-time director John Krokidas, stars Mr. Radcliffe, Mr. Foster and Elizabeth Olsen ("Martha Marcy May Marlene"). This movie looks at a murder that brought together a young Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac and William Burroughs.
The competition lineup includes 56 feature and documentary films, culled from 4,044 submissions, an increase of only two over last year. (The year before, submissions surged 6 percent.)
The festival will slowly dole out its out-of-competition lineups over the next week. These programs include the more star-driven Premieres section; midnight thrillers and comedies; "spotlight" movies that have already played other festivals; and experimental films. Sundance will run Jan. 17 to 27.
The pre-eminent showcase for American independent cinema, Sundance has long prided itself on championing female directors - in sharp contrast to Hollywood - and about a third of next year's competition films were directed or co-directed by women. Francesca Gregorini, a second-time filmmaker (and Ringo Starr's stepdaughter), will be there with "Emanuel and the Truth About Fishes," about a troubled girl who becomes obsessed with her neighbor. "Touchy Feely," a drama about a massage therapist stricken with an aversion to bodily contact, is from the writer-director Lynn Shelton, known for the 2009 comedy "Humpday."
The festival's high-profile opening slot went to "May in the Summer," a drama about a bride-to-be who re-evaluates life after reuniting with her family in Jordan; it was written and directed by Cherien Dabis ("Amreeka"), who also stars in the leading role. Morgan Neville's heartfelt documentary about the lives of backup singers, "Twenty Feet From Stardom," will also play opening night, along with a still-to-be announced shorts program.
Documentaries are one of Sundance's strengths, and the competition crop focuses on the usual topics: abortion, AIDS, war, drug cartels, economic inequality. But selections also include lighter documentaries, like Zachary Heinzerling's "Cutie and the Boxer," a look at the 40-year marriage of the painter Ushio Shinohara and his wife, Noriko.
An unusual number of movies in the 2013 competition were made by people who cut their teeth in television. "Afternoon Delight," a dark comedy about a Los Angeles housewife who tries to rescue a stripper by hiring her as a nanny, was written and directed by Jill Soloway, a producer of shows like "Grey's Anatomy" and "United States of Tara." Liz W. Garcia ("Cold Case," "Memphis Beat") arrives with her first movie, "The Lifeguard," starring Kristen Bell as a lifeguard who starts a dangerous relationship with a troubled teenage boy.
"I love that filmmakers are taking stories that we've seen before and finding entirely new ways to tell them," Mr. Groth said.

HEADLINE: Health Care Entitlements

 BODY:
Congressional Republicans are insisting that big cuts to Medicare and Medicaid be on the table in the negotiations over the so-called fiscal cliff and deficit reduction. That stance is largely a political move against two programs, which have been critical to the public welfare for the past half-century.
Postelection polls show that large majorities of voters for both President Obama and Mitt Romney opposed making large Medicare cuts as a way to reduce the budget deficit. And, the fact is, the Obama administration has already pledged to extract more than $1 trillion in savings over the next decade from these programs. There is not much more that can be cut without hurting the most vulnerable Americans. 
The Affordable Care Act contains provisions that will reduce projected Medicare spending by $716 billion over 10 years, primarily by reducing the annual increases in Medicare reimbursements for hospitals, nursing homes and other health care providers and by reducing unjustified subsidies paid to private Medicare Advantage plans. During the campaign, the Romney-Ryan ticket criticized the president for making such a big cut and even fatuously promised to restore all of it.
On top of those savings, President Obama, in his budget for fiscal year 2013, proposed cutting another $340 billion from Medicare spending over 10 years through tactics like requiring drugmakers to pay rebates to Medicare in some circumstances; reducing payments to some health care providers for treating patients just released from the hospital; reducing coverage of bad debts that hospitals and skilled nursing homes have failed to collect from patients; and charging higher premiums to high-income beneficiaries.
Those cuts seem acceptable as part of a larger budget deal to avert the fiscal cliff. There may be room to squeeze additional savings from health care providers as long as their fiscal health is not jeopardized. But, beyond that, there are very limited options for further reducing Medicare or Medicaid spending.
Upper-income beneficiaries already pay higher Medicare premiums, and there may be some room to charge them more. But middle-income beneficiaries need to be protected from higher costs. And the half of all Medicare beneficiaries who have incomes below $20,000 already pay sizable portions of their income for health care and certainly cannot afford to pay more.
Some ideas should be off the table entirely. The election made it clear that there is strong opposition to turning Medicare into a voucher system. And, as for raising the Medicare eligibility age, respected analysts have concluded that this change would actually increase total health care costs and shift the burden to employers and individuals, without saving the government much money.
Finally, it's important to keep in mind that short-term cuts in Medicare are not urgently needed. Medicare spending per enrollee is projected to increase more slowly than per capita gross domestic product or private insurance spending per enrollee over the next decade, and it is only in the following years that strong cost controls may have to come into play as the population ages and medical costs continue to rise.
Medicaid, a joint state-federal program of health insurance for the poor, has even less ability to absorb cuts. Although Mr. Obama proposed last year to cut federal spending on Medicaid by about $100 billion over 10 years, he soon trimmed that amount to $55 billion in his 2013 budget. Since then, the picture has changed drastically.
Although the Affordable Care Act required the states to expand their Medicaid programs to cover millions of the uninsured, the Supreme Court said the states could decide voluntarily whether to expand. Those that refuse to expand will save the federal government a lot of money in matching funds. The administration should not make any further cuts lest it discourage states from expanding coverage, unless the savings are achieved through better health care management.
The best way to rein in the Medicare and Medicaid costs is to speed up and extend provisions in the Affordable Care Act to encourage better and more efficient ways to deliver health care. That would help reduce federal deficits in the future and save substantial money for the private sector as well.

HEADLINE: The World Catches Up To Yoko Ono

BYLINE: By JACOB BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
''THIS is the jacket, and you see, this is the pants,'' Yoko Ono was saying. ''This is what I wanted to focus on. Accentuate the good bits.''
It was 10:45 a.m. on a recent fall day, and Ms. Ono was sitting in the back of the trendy fashion emporium Opening Ceremony in SoHo, decked out in sunglasses and one of her trademark top hats (Issey Miyake, in case you're wondering), and showing a reporter a series of sketches she'd submitted to the design team she was working with there.
As it happened, the pants she was focused on had a hole where the crotch normally is, and the good bits to which she was referring ... well, you get the point.
Ms. Ono pointed to another sketch, this time with arrows pointing at the nipples, and directions that read: ''holes to put flowers (fresh) in.'' 
Moments later, an assistant brought over kneepads with eyes drawn on them. Why bother asking what they were designed for? Suffice it to say, Ms. Ono's target demographic does not appear to be members of the National Football League.
The newest celebrity entrant into the design game first had the idea of doing men's clothing when she fell in love with John Lennon in the 1960s. She adored the way he looked, both dressed and undressed, and was somewhat perturbed by the fact that it was almost always women who were sexually objectified by designers.
''Men were always wanting us to look good and take off everything,'' Ms. Ono said. ''And we were never able to enjoy men's sexuality in that way.''
She considered doing something about it then, only to realize that the world was not exactly in sync with her sartorial predilections.
Times, of course, changed. Women went to work in droves. Fashion boundaries blurred. Gay men and lesbians became mainstream. The male body became a Madison Avenue commodity.
And then, as she entered her 70s, Ms. Ono made friends with young fashion types who regarded her not as the woman who broke up the Beatles, but as an elder stateswoman of cool; a reminder of what New York used to be before it was taken over by hedge fund types.
So when she met Humberto Leon, a founder of Opening Ceremony, in Tokyo about three years ago, and told him that she had long dreamed of doing a men's wear line, he jumped at the chance to work with her.
''She's always been a radical,'' Mr. Leon said. ''She pushes boundaries.''
Mr. Leon's favorite pieces, for the record, are a series of garments with bells hanging off them.
''There's one that's a plexi-necklace you wear with two bells attached and it's placed where your breasts might be,'' he said. ''And inscribed underneath it says, 'Ring for your mommy.' ''
Another is a black leather belt that says ''don't touch me'' and has a bell near the bellybutton to ward off those who might be inclined to do just that.
''I think people are going to be really excited by them,'' Mr. Leon said.
Are they a little silly? Perhaps. But the collaboration comes at a time when Ms. Ono, who still lives in the Dakota on the Upper West Side, is experiencing a major renaissance on the art and culture scene.
As a visual artist, she has garnered wider appreciation. In June, a retrospective of her work was held at the Serpentine Gallery in London. During the Olympics last summer, she collaborated with Selfridges, the department store in London, on a public art installation, ''Imagine Peace,'' that culminated with footage of John Lennon singing ''Imagine'' during the closing ceremony. By September, she was back in New York for a video installation in Times Square in collaboration with the Art Production Fund.
Meanwhile, Ms. Ono has been all over the news, helping to fight world hunger and bestowing her annual peace prize on Pussy Riot, the female punk group from Russia whose members were convicted of hooliganism in Moscow.
''I know what it means to be hungry,'' Ms. Ono told Rolling Stone last week, at a benefit for WhyHunger at the Hard Rock Cafe in Times Square. ''In the Second World War, I was a little girl. I was evacuated in my country. We were very hungry. I just don't want the children to have that experience.''
And on Wednesday, the Library of Congress announced that it was releasing dozens of interviews between former Capital Records president Joe Smith and music luminaries, including ones with Ms. Ono where she candidly discussed the split of the Beatles and claimed it was actually Ringo Starr, who initiated the breakup of the group. (Those interviews comes after a recent interview Paul McCartney gave in which he, too, said Ms. Ono had nothing to do with the band's demise).
Ms. Ono has also become a frequent presence on the social circuit in New York, attending fund-raisers and fashion parties, like the one for the debut of Lady Gaga's fragrance at the Guggenheim Museum in September.
The petite poly-hyphenate even started a capsule jewelry collection for Swarovski, a collaboration that was celebrated at a Fashion Week party attended by Julianne Moore and Elizabeth Olsen.
Not bad, given that Ms. Ono is just months away from her 80th birthday.
As she tells it, she is simply doing what she's always done, trying to stay active and make the world a better place. And as her friends tell it, there's no better time. The unrest in the Middle East, the economic downturn in Europe and the political challenges here at home, they say, have made people more receptive to her simple, unironic message about loving one another and doing your part to bring about social change.
''I think her message of peace is resonant right now,'' said Catherine Morris, the curator at the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art at the Brooklyn Museum, where Ms. Ono was honored recently. ''Her longstanding commitment to political activism gives her credence.''
Doreen Ramen, a founder of the Art Production Fund, agreed. ''As things get more and more chaotic and we are being pushed to the brink when we have to make a decision and be responsible for our own actions, her work speaks to that,'' she said. ''It's a road map.''
And, as it turns out, Ms. Ono is nowhere near taking a break.
For one, she and her son, Sean Lennon, who is 37, recently started Artists Against Fracking, a group opposed to that method of drilling for natural gas. In typical form, Ms. Ono's message has an apocalyptic edge.
''Basically, if we don't do something about it, we're all going to die,'' she said.
For another, Ms. Ono is finishing an album. It will be an eclectic offering, with ''blues, rock 'n' roll, heavy rock, light rock, all different styles,'' Ms. Ono said.
It, too, is a collaboration with her son, which Ms. Ono relished both because she thinks he is an extraordinary talent (''I'm very lucky as a mother because I didn't know when I impregnated him and he came out in the world that I was getting a good musician for my albums'') and because she saw him as having a vastly superior command of ''modern technology.''
Ms. Ono heard from people who said she shouldn't work with him, that it's the worst thing you can do as a parent. But she was undeterred.
''It's a nice way to meet up with your son,'' she said. ''Because it's getting to a point where, after 30, they have their own lives.''
Putting him on the payroll, Ms. Ono seemed to be saying, was a pretty good way to get her phone calls returned. Moreover, at the end of the day, Ms. Ono said, her son always knows who the boss is: ''Of course, me. Excuse me?''

HEADLINE: Medicare Is Faulted on Shift to Electronic Records

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON

 BODY:
The conversion to electronic medical records -- a critical piece of the Obama administration's plan for health care reform -- is ''vulnerable'' to fraud and abuse because of the failure of Medicare officials to develop appropriate safeguards, according to a sharply critical report to be issued Thursday by federal investigators.
The use of electronic medical records has been central to the aim of overhauling health care in America. Advocates contend that electronic records systems will improve patient care and lower costs through better coordination of medical services, and the Obama administration is spending billions of dollars to encourage doctors and hospitals to switch to electronic records to track patient care.
But the report says Medicare, which is charged with managing the incentive program that encourages the adoption of electronic records, has failed to put in place adequate safeguards to ensure that information being provided by hospitals and doctors about their electronic records systems is accurate. To qualify for the incentive payments, doctors and hospitals must demonstrate that the systems lead to better patient care, meeting a so-called meaningful use standard by, for example, checking for harmful drug interactions. 
Medicare ''faces obstacles'' in overseeing the electronic records incentive program ''that leave the program vulnerable to paying incentives to professionals and hospitals that do not fully meet the meaningful use requirements,'' the investigators concluded. The report was prepared by the Office of Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees Medicare.
The investigators contrasted the looser management of the incentive program with the agency's pledge to more closely monitor Medicare payments of medical claims. Medicare officials have indicated that the agency intends to move away from a ''pay and chase'' model, in which it tried to get back any money it has paid in error, to one in which it focuses on trying to avoid making unjustified payments in the first place.
Late Wednesday, a Medicare spokesman said in a statement: ''Protecting taxpayer dollars is our top priority and we have implemented aggressive procedures to hold providers accountable. Making a false claim is a serious offense with serious consequences and we believe the overwhelming majority of doctors and hospitals take seriously their responsibility to honestly report their performance.''
The government's investment in electronic records was authorized under the broader stimulus package passed in 2009. Medicare expects to spend nearly $7 billion over five years as a way of inducing doctors and hospitals to adopt and use electronic records. So far, the report said, the agency has paid 74, 317 health professionals and 1,333 hospitals. By attesting that they meet the criteria established under the program, a doctor can receive as much as $44,000 for adopting electronic records, while a hospital could be paid as much as $2 million in the first year of its adoption. The inspector general's report follows earlier concerns among regulators and others over whether doctors and hospitals are using electronic records inappropriately to charge more for services, as reported by The New York Times last September, and is likely to fuel the debate over the government's efforts to promote electronic records. Critics say the push for electronic records may be resulting in higher Medicare spending with little in the way of improvement in patients' health. Thursday's report did not address patient care.
Even those within the industry say the speed with which systems are being developed and adopted by hospitals and doctors has led to a lack of clarity over how the records should be used and concerns about their overall accuracy.
''We've gone from the horse and buggy to the Model T, and we don't know the rules of the road. Now we've had a big car pileup,'' said Lynne Thomas Gordon, the chief executive of the American Health Information Management Association, a trade group in Chicago. The association, which contends more study is needed to determine whether hospitals and doctors actually are abusing electronic records to increase their payments, says it supports more clarity.
Although there is little disagreement over the potential benefits of electronic records in reducing duplicative tests and avoiding medical errors, critics increasingly argue that the federal government has not devoted enough time or resources to making certain the money it is investing is being well spent.
House Republicans echoed these concerns in early October in a letter to Kathleen Sebelius, secretary of health and human services. Citing the Times article, they called for suspending the incentive program until concerns about standardization had been resolved. ''The top House policy makers on health care are concerned that H.H.S. is squandering taxpayer dollars by asking little of providers in return for incentive payments,'' said a statement issued at the same time by the Republicans, who are likely to seize on the latest inspector general report as further evidence of lax oversight. Republicans have said they will continue to monitor the program.
In her letter in response, which has not been made public, Ms. Sebelius dismissed the idea of suspending the incentive program, arguing that it ''would be profoundly unfair to the hospitals and eligible professionals that have invested billions of dollars and devoted countless hours of work to purchase and install systems and educate staff.'' She said Medicare was trying to determine whether electronic records had been used in any fraudulent billing but she insisted that the current efforts to certify the systems and address the concerns raised by the Republicans and others were adequate.
The report also takes to task another federal agency that certifies the software systems used to qualify for the Medicare incentive payments, saying it should do more to ensure the systems' reports are accurate and meet the ''meaningful use'' criteria.
Medicare has not audited any of the $3.6 billion payments it has made to date, according to the report, which faults the agency for its lack of prepayment review and reliance on self-reporting after money has been spent.
In their written response to the report, federal officials said they agreed with some of the inspector general's recommendations that they clarify what hospitals and doctors need to do to qualify for the payments. But Marilyn Tavenner, the acting administrator for Medicare, strongly disagreed with the idea that the agency should do more to ensure payments are appropriate before writing a check.
Requiring an audit before paying hospitals and doctors ''could significantly delay payments to providers,'' she said, and these reviews ''would also impose an increased upfront burden on providers.'' Ms. Tavenner said Medicare took some steps to make sure providers were eligible for the payments but ''does not believe prepayment audit is necessary at this juncture.'' Medicare maintains that it has systems in place to verify the information being submitted.
Medicare has developed plans to audit payments it has made since the program started in 2011 and says it expects to issue additional guidance for hospitals and doctors.
The other federal agency, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, agreed with the inspector general's recommendations and said officials were already working to improve the process of certifying systems.
The inspector general said Medicare should be able to review at least some payments before they were made to determine whether the hospitals and doctors actually qualified. The investigators suggest identifying a small number of providers where the information provided was inconsistent and conducting a review or audit.

HEADLINE: rik Izraelewicz, Editor of Le Monde, 58

BYLINE: By ERIC PFANNER

 BODY:
PARIS -- rik Izraelewicz, editorial director of Le Monde, died on Tuesday in Paris. He was 58.
Employees said Mr. Izraelewicz collapsed from a heart attack while working on the French newspaper's Wednesday issue. Efforts to revive him were unsuccessful, and he was pronounced dead at a Paris hospital, the newspaper said Wednesday. 
The death of Mr. Izraelewicz, who had served in the top editorial post for less than two years, opens a new chapter in the turbulent history of the newspaper. Mr. Izraelewicz had been hired by the new owners of the paper, a group of French investors who acquired control from the paper's employees in 2010. Le Monde did not immediately name a successor.
Mr. Izraelewicz, a former top editor at two French business dailies, Les chos and La Tribune, had moved to overhaul Le Monde, known for its highbrow writing and left-leaning politics. Articles about pressing economic matters, especially the euro crisis, were featured on the front page.
Though Mr. Izraelewicz was close to prominent members of the Socialist Party, he was no leftist ideologue. In an obituary in its Thursday issue, Le Monde described Mr. Izraelewicz as having been from a pragmatic generation of French socialists ''eager for reforms that shape the world as it is, for better or worse.''
Before joining Les chos and, later, La Tribune, Mr. Izraelewicz had worked as a journalist at Le Monde, where one of his postings was in New York. ''From the Anglo-Saxon world, which he knew well, he adopted his professional codes, but also a certain coolness and a great sense of humor,'' the newspaper's journalists said in a statement.
Co-workers said Mr. Izraelewicz, known for his long hours, had guarded his private life carefully.
Mr. Izraelewicz was born on Feb. 6, 1954, in Strasbourg, in the Alsace region of France.
He was a graduate of the elite international business school HEC, one of the grandes coles that train much of the French ruling and intellectual class.
His death brought a tribute from President Franois Hollande, who described him in a statement as a ''renowned economist, a distinguished professional and a man as demanding as generous.''
''His kindness to other people never prevented him from being intractable in judging their actions or commenting on their choices,'' Mr. Hollande said. ''France has lost a journalist of great talent.''
Mr. Izraelewicz was also the author of a number of books, including two volumes about the rising economic power of China.

HEADLINE: Google Fires a Rare Public Salvo Over Aggregators

BYLINE: By KEVIN J. O'BRIEN

 BODY:
BERLIN -- Google's imprint on daily life is hard to ignore in Europe, where it reportedly has 93 percent of the Internet search market, more than in the United States. Yet when it comes to its lobbying of lawmakers, Google prefers a low profile.
That all changed this week when Google fired a rare public broadside against a proposal that would force it and other online aggregators of news content to pay German newspaper and magazine publishers to display snippets of news in Web searches.
The proposed ancillary copyright law, which is to have its first reading Friday in the lower house of Parliament, the Bundestag, has ignited a storm of hyperbole pitting Google and local Web advocates against powerful publishers including Sddeutsche Zeitung, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Bild and Die Welt.
Google took off the gloves Tuesday when it opened a campaign urging German users to e-mail members of the Bundestag with their concerns. Google said the proposal would shrink the free flow of information on the Internet in Germany, perhaps even forcing it to display blank links to German references. 
The issue is also being debated in other European capitals. In October, President Franois Hollande of France asked the Google executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, to have a representative meet with a government mediator to resolve the issue. The company complied. The implicit threat was that if no solution were found, France might pursue a legislative option.
Christoph Keese, the senior vice president of Axel Springer, publisher of Bild and Die Welt, two of the largest-circulation newspapers in Germany, said lawmakers in Italy, Switzerland, Austria, Portugal and Spain were considering similar measures. Google said that conversely, new laws passed in Canada, and proposals that could soon be adopted in Britain and the Netherlands, would further loosen copyright restrictions and free up new kinds of Internet sharing.
The German proposal ''would make it much more difficult to find the information that you seek in the Internet,'' Google warned in its campaign, which it titled ''Defend Your Internet.''
The unusually public salvos from Google caught many German lawmakers by surprise. Chancellor Angela Merkel raised the issue at a working dinner Tuesday with a group of lawmakers from her party, the Christian Democratic Union, including Peter Beyer, a member of the Bundestag from Ratingen, a town near Dsseldorf.
''She asked us how many e-mails we'd received and we told her,'' he said Wednesday during an interview, adding that he had received fewer than 10 from Google supporters. ''Most of us had only received a few, three or four. She and the rest of the C.D.U. are still behind this law. I have no doubts that it will pass.''
That may not be as simple as supporters envision.
Germany's main technology industry association, the Federal Association for Information Technology, Telecommunications and New Media, known as BitKom, has come out sharply against the proposal, saying it will curb investment in the German digital economy.
''They are planning a law that would be unique worldwide, which would send a negative signal to investors: Innovative online services are not desired in Germany,'' said Bernhard Rohleder, chief executive of BitKom.
A letter to Bundestag members signed jointly by 16 copyright law professors, the Max Planck Institute for Intellectual Property and Competition Law, and Grur, an association representing 5,300 German copyright lawyers, warned that the law could cost Germany jobs. ''There is a danger that this law will have unforeseen negative consequences,'' the letter read.
By midday Wednesday, one day into the campaign, Google said that 25,000 people had signed its petition and that it expected a half-million people to have viewed its Web site.
The showdown being played out in Berlin may not be resolved by lawmakers until early next year. But it stems from a long-running dispute between Google and German newspaper and magazine publishers that dates from 2007, said Anja Pasquay, a spokeswoman for the German Association of Newspaper Publishers.
That was when publishers first decided to pursue a legislative solution after failing to persuade Google to sit down and negotiate a licensing agreement for the industry, Ms. Pasquay said.
''Almost all of our members support this,'' Ms. Pasquay said during an interview. ''Our members are not opposed to the Internet economy. They welcome it. But they don't think they have to give away their work for free on the Web.''
Ralf Bremer, a Google spokesman in Berlin, said it was in constant contact with German publishers, who routinely receive 70 to 80 percent of revenue from advertisements displayed on their Web sites through AdSense, Google's online advertising service. Globally, Google distributed $7 billion in ad-sharing revenue to publishers in 2011, some of which went to German news outlets.
German publishers, like those elsewhere, also have the ability to send a code to Google that effectively blocks aggregation services from mining and displaying their content. Google also gives publishers another tool that enables them to decide whether content in search rankings is displayed in a short snippet or left blank in a simple link.
Mr. Bremer said Google had gone public with its opposition to the proposed law because German news organizations were not reporting on the issue or were slanting their coverage to emphasize their own stance.
''The German public does not know about this proposal,'' Mr. Bremer said. ''The German print press has been reluctant to report on this in a balanced manner. We therefore came up with our own information.''
In a blog post, Google's director of public policy in Europe, Simon Hampton, cited a statement released by the European Journalism Center, a professional training and seminar organization in Maastricht, the Netherlands, which compared the German proposal to asking local newsstands to pay royalties for just displaying newspapers and magazines.
Under the proposal before the Bundestag, aggregators like Google would first have to obtain the permission of publishers to present even one-paragraph summaries of free content in Web search rankings. Publishers are more than willing to sell Google a license for this purpose, Mr. Keese of Axel Springer said. He predicted that Google's public relations offensive might cause a backlash among German lawmakers, who are unaccustomed to targeted, issue-oriented Internet lobbying.
''Google is using its dominant market position and power to get its way,'' Mr. Keese said. ''They are doing what they always do. They don't negotiate. But they are more than willing to use their power to protect their monopoly revenues.''
Mr. Beyer, the Bundestag member, said Google was overstating the issues. ''Google is a super search engine and a great company, but this does not spell the end of free information on the Internet,'' he said. ''Google should stick to the facts and tell the truth.''

HEADLINE: Looking for Lessons In the 1990 Budget Deal

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
Thomas S. Foley, a Democrat, and John H. Sununu, a Republican, were two of the Big 8 who, in 1990, negotiated a landmark bipartisan budget deal between the White House and Congress. On Wednesday, they were in accord again, agreeing that President Obama and Congressional leaders face a tougher task reaching a compromise now, in more polarized times.
Mr. Foley, the genial House speaker 22 years ago, and Mr. Sununu, the pugnacious White House chief of staff to the first President Bush, joined other players from the 1990 budget negotiations on Capitol Hill on Wednesday to discuss what lessons that prolonged showdown may hold for current leaders, who have much less time to avoid the fiscal crisis bearing down in January. 
Then, as now, the government was divided - Republicans held the White House and Democrats controlled Congress in 1990 - and officials faced a self-imposed deadline for a deficit-reduction agreement. Without a deal, huge across-the-board spending cuts would occur that would have jolted the economy, just as they would now. Republicans also opposed any tax increases then, yet without those increases Democrats would not agree to domestic spending cuts.
But as partisan as the environment seemed back then, Mr. Foley said officials benefited not only from occasional bipartisanship but also from what he called transpartisanship, personal relationships that transcended parties and are all but missing two decades later.
Mr. Sununu, a former New Hampshire governor, agreed, noting that Mr. Bush during his days in Congress had gotten to know Mr. Foley and other Democrats, who by 1990 were Congressional leaders.
"The climate really was different" for the 1990 talks, Mr. Sununu said. But, he added, "it wasn't accidental." Instead, he said, the Bush White House "exploited as much as possible" the personal relationships among the central players.
For all the complaints about partisanship during Wednesday's panel discussions, which were hosted by George Mason University, the Bipartisan Policy Center and Deloitte & Touche, the participation of Mr. Sununu was evidence that some of the players in 1990 were no slouches at political brawling. (Later, George W. Bush was called in to fire Mr. Sununu from his father's team.) This year, as a highly visible adviser to Mitt Romney, Mr. Sununu was at the center of several controversies, for calling Mr. Obama "lazy" and "a bumbler" and once saying, "I wish this president would learn how to be an American."
The serious negotiations in the fall of 1990 followed months of maneuvering, including meetings at Andrews Air Force Base to escape reporters. What made success possible, both sides agree, was the president's written acknowledgment in midsummer that higher revenues had to be part of a deal, along with spending cuts.
That act violated Mr. Bush's "no new taxes" campaign vow in 1988. So, while the 1990 deal is widely considered a Bush achievement, and a factor in the prosperity and balanced budgets that followed in the Clinton years, it helped cost Mr. Bush re-election after many anti-tax Republicans mutinied. Even his son, running for president in 2000, all but ignored the achievement and explicitly ruled out a job in a presidency of his own for his father's budget director, Richard G. Darman, who has since died.
"No one should think George H. W. Bush didn't know what risks he was taking" as a first-term president who would soon face the voters, said Michael Graetz, a former Treasury official and now a Columbia Law School professor.
Picking up on that point, Philip Joyce, a former government budget analyst now teaching at the University of Maryland, said the lesson now for Mr. Obama was that "presidential leadership matters." And, he suggested, that should come easier to a president just re-elected, who never has to face the voters again.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Audi Diesels: Changing Perceptions

BYLINE: TORI TELLEM


HIGHLIGHT: Audi hopes that American buyers will let go of the decades-old perception that diesels are smoky beasts. 

 BODY:
 Introduced on Wednesday: 2014 Audi A6, A7, A8, Q5 and 2013 Q7 TDI models
 What it is: Diesels for everyone! Almost everyone, at least. Audi has now added the TDI diesel engine as an option to several of its models in the United States. 
 What it isn't: Can we once and for all agree to let go of the decades-old perception that diesels are smoky beasts?
 What makes it tick: The TDI engine is a new 3-liter V-6, worth 240 horsepower and 406 pound-feet of torque. Fuel economy for the flagship A8 is estimated at 24 m.p.g. city and 36 m.p.g. highway, while the Q7 is estimated at 19 m.p.g. city and 28 m.p.g. highway.
 How much, how soon? The Q7 has been available since September; the A8 drops in the spring of 2013, while the A6, A7 and Q5 will arrive next fall. Official pricing for the 2014s will be announced later. The Q7 starts at $52,000, excluding delivery charge.
 Our take: The Los Angeles auto show is green central, where fuel economy is discussed ad nauseum, so introducing the new diesel lineup in conjunction with the show makes sense. But given American buyers' reluctance to embrace diesels, will bringing the TDI variant to many of its United States models translate to higher sales for Audi?
An earlier version of this post misstated the scope of Audi's new diesel offerings. While the company plans to expand the new TDI engine to additional models, it will not be offered in all Audis sold in the United States.

HEADLINE: Porsche Cayman: Lighter on Its Feet

BYLINE: TORI TELLEM


HIGHLIGHT: The third-generation Cayman goes on sale next spring. 

 BODY:
 What it is: 2014 Porsche Cayman
 What it isn't: It's not a 2013 Cayman. That doesn't exist, so if you find one, you're either a sucker or about to become a zillionaire with a one-of-a-kind Porsche. (It's the former.) 
 What makes it tick: Want a sign that the Mayans might be correctly predicting the end of the world in a couple of weeks? Porsche is actually promoting its fuel-economy numbers. If you're the one person who takes that into consideration when buying a Porsche, know that by having shed a few pounds the Cayman will provide up to 32 m.p.g., depending on the configuration. Two 6-cylinder engines are available: a Boxster-borrowed 2.7-liter in the Cayman (275 horsepower, 10 more than before) and a Boxster/Carrera-borrowed 3.4-liter in the Cayman S (325 horses, up by 5).
 How much, how soon? The Cayman will start at $53,550, the Cayman S at $64,750. Arrival is scheduled for the spring.
 Our take: The third-generation Cayman is aggressively attractive, suggesting a performance experience so good even a Harlequin novel would blush.

HEADLINE: Honda Civic: What's the Difference?

BYLINE: JERRY GARRETT


HIGHLIGHT: The 2013 Civic may not be different enough to distance itself from the disappointing 2012 model. But the Si version, at least, gets a bit more power. 

 BODY:
 Introduced on Thursday: 2013 Honda Civic
 What it is: What Honda calls the "much anticipated" re-do of the critically trashed ninth-generation Civic compact, which was introduced just last year. So much cost-cutting was evident in its predecessor, one reviewer labeled it "a betrayal." 
 What it isn't: Despite more expressive exterior and interior styling, upgraded cabin appointments and refined ride and handling, the 2013 Civic may not be different enough to distance itself safely from the smoking crater left8:33 p.m. | Updated by the 2012 model.
 What makes it tick? The same economical but power-challenged 1.8-liter 4-cylinder engine that pulls the current model. The hopped-up Si version raises the standard 140-horsepower output to 201.
 How much, how soon? Priced comparably to the $16,000-and-up Civic that is getting the heave-ho, though new standard features include a rearview camera and Bluetooth capability. If you like it, you can buy one immediately - Thursday, in fact, is the day this new Civic goes on sale. That's hardly soon enough, even though sales for the disappointing 2012 model have been quite good.
 Our take: It looks more Accord-ish, but it still has too much ninth-generation Civic in this gen-9\xC2 model. Still visible: the pallid palette of exterior paint colors (Urban Titanium Metallic?) and indifferent interior styling. There's not enough of the DNA of the previous eight generations of the fun-to-drive, pleasure-to-own, value-retentive Civic that America grew to love. Something to look forward to: the 10th-generation model, when it comes in two or three years, is to be engineered entirely in North America.

HEADLINE: Applying Evidence to Social Programs

BYLINE: JON BARON


HIGHLIGHT: As with medicine, rigorous studies of social programs can produce important, credible evidence about what works, illuminating a path to major progress, a policy expert says. 

 BODY:
 In response to our recent series of posts on stagnant incomes for the middle class and poor, Jon Baron -- president of the Coalition for Evidence-Based Policy, an unaligned research group in Washington -- argues that better functioning government programs could help. 
Despite a myriad of new government programs and spending over the last 40 years, the system has failed to improve economic and social well-being for an astonishingly large segment of the American population. There is a different way forward, focused on increasing the effectiveness of existing funds. This way forward could be an excellent fit as the administration and Congress ponder a second-term agenda for President Obama with little new money to spend. 
Census Bureau data show that over the last 40 years, average yearly income of the bottom 40 percent of U.S. households - now at $20,221 - has changed little after adjusting for inflation.
In education, although the college graduation rate has risen, the high school graduation rate peaked around 81 percent in the early 1970s. Since then, it has been stuck between 75 and 80 percent. Department of Education data show that reading and math achievement of 17-year-olds - the end product of our K-12 educational system - has not improved over 40 years, despite a 90 percent rise in public spending per student (adjusted for inflation).
Ending this stagnation requires a central role for government, but not through its traditional, unimaginative approach to social spending. The field of medicine shows how it could work. Medicine has seen amazing progress over the last half-century - for example, a 50 percent drop in the United States death rate from coronary heart disease and childhood cancers. A driver of that success can be applied to social spending, resulting in major gains in people's social and economic well-being. 
That driver is scientifically rigorous evidence about "what works." 
Scientifically rigorous studies - particularly, the "gold standard" of randomized controlled trials - are a mainstay of medicine, providing conclusive evidence of effectiveness for most major medical advances in recent history. In social spending, by contrast, such studies have only a toehold. Where they have been used, however, they have demonstrated the same ability to produce important, credible evidence about what works - and illuminated a path to major progress.
A recent example is the large randomized trial of a program that provides streamlined, personal assistance, through H&R Block offices, to low- and moderate- income families in completing their children's college financial aid application. The program, costing just $90 per person, increased college attendance by a remarkable 29 percent over a four-year period, compared to a control group of families not receiving the assistance, according to a study by the economists Eric Bettinger, Bridget Terry Long, Philip Oreopoulos and Lisa Sanbonmatsu.
Another such trial has shown that so-called career academies in low-income high schools - providing students with a smaller, career-themed learning community of like-minded peers - raised their earnings by $2,200 per year over the eight years after high school, compared with a control group.
In medicine, a pharmaceutical drug or medical device backed by such evidence of effectiveness is put into widespread use, because the system is set up to reward strong evidence. The Food and Drug Administration specifically requires such evidence before licensing a drug or device for market. Licensing then signals to health care providers and patients that effectiveness has been established, spurring demand.
In social spending, though, scientific evidence plays little role in allocating resources. Historically, major programs like Head Start, Title I at the Department of Education and the Job Training Partnership Act have been set up as multibillion-dollar faucets, allocating streams of money to state and local agencies - often by formula - to support a diverse array of activities. Rigorous evidence has little say in which activities receive support. Thus, activities with strong evidence of large effects, like the H&R Block effort, may never get funds from these faucets and never expand.
The promising news is that in a few recent instances, Congress has enacted initiatives in which evidence of effectiveness is a main factor determining which activities get funds. An example is the federal Early Childhood Home Visiting Program, begun as a pilot under President Bush and expanded by President Obama. It underwrites efforts like the research-proven Nurse-Family Partnership, which provides nurse home visits to low-income first-time mothers. Evaluated in rigorous randomized trials, the partnership has been shown to reduce child abuse, neglect and injuries by 20 to 50 percent, and to generate sizable improvements in child cognitive and educational outcomes.
The administration and Congress could fundamentally shift the social spending landscape by incorporating such evidence-based funding criteria into billion-dollar federal programs, rather than just a few isolated initiatives. Doing so would create a powerful new incentive for the development, rigorous evaluation and - if effective - dissemination of new program strategies and models. It would catalyze evidence-driven improvements in an otherwise moribund system.
For 40 years, America's promise of rising prosperity has eluded nearly half of the population. A second-term agenda that makes evidence the core principle in social spending - rather than a faucet - could restore the dream for millions of Americans.

HEADLINE: Biden Shops at Costco

BYLINE: PETER BAKER


HIGHLIGHT: Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. made a surprise stop at a newly opened Costco in Washington on Thursday. 

 BODY:
A time of austerity in the nation's capital? Not for Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who went on a holiday shopping spree at a new Costco store on Thursday. 
Mr. Biden showed up for the grand opening of the discount chain's first store inside the Washington city limits, joining the co-founder, James D. Sinegal, a prominent campaign fund-raiser for President Obama and Mr. Biden, and the company's chief executive, Craig Jelinek, whom the president called this month to talk about the federal financial crisis.
Flashing his own Costco card, the vice president then made his way through the aisles, filling a shopping cart with all sorts of consumer goods. Among the items spotted by reporters traveling with him were at least a dozen children's books, a big apple pie, fire logs and a 32-inch Panasonic television.
"Now you know why my wife doesn't let me shop alone," Mr. Biden told reporters cheerfully.
Mr. Biden also appeared intrigued by the watches, studying a $1,200 timepiece for a while and even calling his daughter Ashley to "get some guidance." He ended up picking another, less expensive watch, according to a White House official.
But he resisted when Costco employees tried to lure him into the tire department. "Hey, man, I don't need tires," he said. "I don't drive anymore."
Mr. Biden's colleagues in the White House have expressed concern that the automatic tax increases set to take effect at the end of the year would depress consumer demand by as much as $200 billion next year. Evidently, Mr. Biden was trying to single-handedly prevent a "fiscal cliff" for the nation's retailers.
Some of the purchases, like the children's books, were bound for a charity founded by his wife, Jill. But others were clearly meant for presents. "I know you won't tell anybody what I bought for Christmas," he told reporters.

HEADLINE: Despite Setbacks, Investor Is Bullish on Clean Technology

BYLINE: RANDALL SMITH


HIGHLIGHT: After taking a hit on investments in biofuel companies, Vinod Khosla seems unwavering in his commitment to the clean energy industry, pouring more money into start-ups. 

 BODY:
Vinod Khosla crowed about the clean energy industry last year. Three of the biofuel start-ups in his venture capital portfolio had just gone public, and the stocks had risen considerably after their debuts. "I challenge anybody to claim that clean tech done right is a disaster," Mr. Khosla said at a conference, rebuffing recent criticism. "We've generated more profits there than anybody has."
Since then, Mr. Khosla, the founder of Khosla Ventures, has watched much of those paper gains evaporate. As the clean energy industry broadly has taken a hit, shares of the biofuel companies - Amyris, Gevo and KiOR - have slumped 70 percent to 90 percent from their peaks. His stakes, once worth as much as $1.3 billion, are now valued at roughly $378 million.
The billionaire investor has been caught in the cyclical downdraft. 
The public stocks of solar, wind and biofuel companies are suffering amid industrywide pressures. The price of natural gas remains low. Europe has pulled back on incentives. American subsidies are in question after the bankruptcy of the solar panel maker Solyndra. And China is providing formidable low-cost competition.
"The whole clean tech sector has been out of favor," said Pavel Molchanov, an analyst at Raymond James & Associates, a brokerage firm. "I'd be hard pressed to name one trading above its I.P.O. price."
Despite the crosscurrents, Mr. Khosla seems unwavering in his commitment. He is pouring money into start-ups. Khosla Ventures recently invested more in LightSail Energy, a three-year-old start-up working to develop low-cost energy storage. He is also sticking with his public companies. His firm, for example, still owns 54 percent of KiOR.
"He's a visionary who likes to make big bets on ideas that can really change the world," said Andy Bechtolsheim, who co-founded Sun Microsystems with Mr. Khosla 30 years ago and shares a house with him at Big Sur on the California coast. "I would think he's made a larger personal bet on green tech than anybody else."
While the public markets are raising short-term doubts, the long-term investment thinking remains unchanged. Governments around the globe are pushing to find alternative sources of energy in an effort to reduce their dependence on fossil fuels that may hurt the environment. In a television interview in 2007, Mr. Khosla said "mainstream solutions" could replace up to 80 percent of oil-based power. Without them, he said, "this planet is history the way we know it today." After Hurricane Sandy, the subject of global warming - and changing climate conditions - has again come to the forefront.
In a recent blog poston the Forbes Web site, Mr. Khosla acknowledged the shift in market sentiment. "Clean tech went through a time when it was in vogue and now it is not," he wrote. "The financing environment for clean tech companies is tough today," he added. But he said he still expected "to do better than industry averages by keeping our losing companies to a minority."
Since founding his venture capital firm in 2004, Mr. Khosla has become one of the most vocal advocates for clean tech innovation, buying stakes in about 60 industry start-ups. Ausra, a solar thermal start-up that had drawn $130 million in venture backing, was sold in 2010 to the French nuclear plant builder Areva for about $250 million, according to one industry estimate. And SeaMicro, a low-power server maker, was bought this year by Advanced Micro Devices for $334 million, more than five times the amount invested by its venture backers, according to a SeaMicro co-founder, Andrew Feldman.
It's unclear how the broader clean tech portfolio has performed at Khosla Ventures. Mr. Khosla declined to disclose the firm's returns or to comment for the article.
But one of his funds, which raised $1 billion to invest in clean tech and other start-ups, shows gain of 30 percent since its inception in 2009, according to filings by the California Public Employees' Retirement System, the largest state pension fund. In his Forbes blog post, Mr. Khosla said a recent fund, which raised $1.05 billion in October 2011, was oversubscribed, and his firm's broader performance since 2006 had "well exceeded typical venture funds." In that period, venture funds over all have returned 7.25 percent annually after fees, according to industry data.
Mr. Khosla's commitment is an outgrowth of his three decades at the cutting edge of technology.
A native of India, Mr. Khosla, 57, earned a master's degree in biomedical engineering from Carnegie Mellon and an M.B.A. from Stanford in 1980. After starting the design automation company Daisy Systems in 1982, he co-founded Sun Microsystems, then a growing technology company.
At Sun, he supplied drive and vision. But Mr. Khosla, who is known for his blunt talk and intense manner, was replaced as chief executive two years later and left the company shortly thereafter.
In 1986, he joined the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. Over the next two decades, Mr. Khosla scored sizable returns betting on the growth of fiber optic networks. Two companies, Cerent and Siara Systems, were sold for a combined $15 billion-plus at the height of the late-1990s dot-com bubble.
Mr. Khosla was looking into alternative fuel technologies at Kleiner Perkins when a business plan for an ethanol start-up crossed his desk in 2003. The plan "sat on a corner of my desk for nearly 18 months while I read everything I could about petroleum and its alternatives," he wrote in an article for Wired magazine in 2006.
When he branched out on his own in 2004, Mr. Khosla invested millions in the ethanol start-up, Celunol. He soon established himself as a top venture capitalist in clean tech, attracting prominent outside investors like Microsoft's founder, Bill Gates. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain joined the firm as a senior adviser.
Over the years, Mr. Khosla has experienced his share of blowups.
In September 2011, Khosla-backed Range Fuels, a wood-chips-to-ethanol company, went bankrupt after receiving a $44 million grant from the Department of Energy and $33 million under a Department of Agriculture loan guarantee. When The Wall Street Journal editorial page criticized Range Fuels as an "exercise in corporate welfare," Mr. Khosla lashed back, saying the authors inhabited an "ivory tower" that was "full of people who don't understand technology."
Sometimes, Mr. Khosla's companies had to pivot from their original plans and focus on new markets. For example, Calera was founded in 2007 with plans to use power plant exhaust to make cement. Mr. Khosla called its technology "game changing" in 2008.
But the company encountered some setbacks. It postponed plans for commercial-scale production in 2010 pending further research and later cut its 145-employee work force by two-thirds. Since then, Calera has broadened its focus, developing other products like fillers for paper and plastics.
Like many venture capital investors, Mr. Khosla will risk a few strikeouts for the chance to hit home runs. "My willingness to fail is what gives me the ability to succeed," the investor has said frequently.
The odds can be especially brutal in clean technology. The projects are often capital-intensive - like $200 million or more for a biofuels plant - and they can take years to pay out, said Sam Shelton, a research engineer at Georgia Institute of Technology. By comparison, social media start-ups often require little upfront money and few employees. "The economics are totally different," Mr. Shelton said.
In part, Mr. Khosla aims to take stakes when the companies are still getting off the ground, rather than waiting until they're more mature and more expensive. He first bought a stake in KiOR, which aims to convert wood chips to gas and diesel fuel, in 2007. The company is now completing the first of five planned plants in Mississippi with the help of a $75 million interest-free loan from the state.
Mr. Khosla is "always thinking at a very high level about the potential of an idea," KiOR's chief executive, Fred Cannon, said. "He has a very good feel for when to step on the gas."
After jumping in early, Mr. Khosla appears willing to ride out the swings, in both directions. Over the years, public filings indicate he has plowed roughly $80 million into KiOR, amassing a 54 percent stake in the company. Although the stock is off its peak levels and I.P.O. investors are still underwater, his holdings are worth $356 million - a threefold gain.
An earlier version of this article mischaracterized Mr. Khosla's return on his investment in KiOR. He invested roughly $80 million and his holdings are worth $356 million - a threefold gain, not a fourfold gain.

HEADLINE: A 10 Percent Savings Rate? Yes, but There's a Catch

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: Military members in combat zones can earn a high rate on their savings. 

 BODY:
Most of us looking for a low-risk savings account would jump at an annual interest rate of even 1 percent. So, what would you think of earning 10 percent?
That's right: 10 percent.
There is a catch, of course. Getting this rate involves risking your life in a foreign country. It's only available to members of the United States military serving in designated combat zones, including Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan and the Persian Gulf.
The rate is available through the Department of Defense Savings Deposit Program. The program, which dates to the Vietnam era, was created to "provide members of the uniformed services serving in a designated combat zones the opportunity to build their financial savings," according to a Web site maintained by Defense Finance and Accounting Service, which provides payment services to the Defense Department. 
The program caught our eye here at Bucks when it was mentioned in a publication from USAA, which provides banking and financial services for members of the military and their families. USAA says the program "can provide a welcome savings boost, thanks to a generous 10 percent interest rate earned on combat pay."
Joseph Montanaro, a financial planner with USAA in San Antonio, Tex., says the program can be a boon for service members, allowing them to earn about 10 times what their money would earn in a typical domestic savings account at current rates.
There are a host of conditions, however. To qualify, military members must be deployed in a combat zone for either 30 consecutive days, or at least one day in each of three consecutive months. A maximum of $10,000 can be deposited in the account, typically by automatic paycheck withdrawal (or "allotment," in military parlance).
The program is restricted to pay earned while in the qualifying zone. Soldiers can't deposit more than their net monthly pay. Nor can service members simply take $10,000 they had managed to save in a low-rate certificate of deposit and put it in the military program as a lump sum to earn the higher rate, said Steve Burghardt, a spokesman for Defense Finance and Accounting Service.
The funds are paid out when the combat tour is finished, he said. Money can be left in the account indefinitely -- but interest accrues for just 90 days after soldiers return from combat duty. In general, the funds can't be withdrawn until soldiers are no longer eligible for the program. If an emergency comes up, military members have to petition their commanding officer to obtain early access to the money.
And, while combat pay isn't taxable, interest earned in the savings program is.
Roughly 19,500 service members currently participate in the program, Mr. Burghardt said.
I plugged some numbers into an online savings calculator. If a soldier deposited $300 a month into the savings program for a year at 10 percent, he'd earn about $170 in interest. A 1 percent rate -- the most generous currently available on low-risk savings accounts back home -- would earn roughly $17. (The numbers may vary slightly depending on the assumptions built into the calculator used.) So the program appears to be a benefit, for those who are eligible -- and who don't need access to the money right away.
As for those of us who aren't eligible, maybe we should just be thankful that we're not.
Have you ever used the Defense Department's savings program? What was your experience?

HEADLINE: A Liberal Moment

BYLINE: TIMOTHY EGAN


HIGHLIGHT: What we're seeing is the advance of progressive political ideas by a majority that spurns an obvious label. 

 BODY:
Still hard to believe, I told a friend the other day while trying to fathom the election results, that pot is legal in my state, gays are free to marry, and a black man who vowed to raise taxes on the rich won a majority of the popular vote for president, back to back - the first time anyone has done that since Franklin Roosevelt's second election in 1936.
And yet only one in four voters identified themselves as "liberal" in national exit polls. Conservatives were 35 percent, and moderates the plurality, at 41 percent. The number of voters who agreed to the "l" tag was up by three percentage points, for what it's worth, from 22 percent in 2008. 
What's going on here, demography and democracy seem to be saying at the same time, is the advance of progressive political ideas by a majority that spurns an obvious label. Liberals have long been a distinct minority; liberalism, in its better forms, has been triumphant at key times since the founding of the Republic.

Abraham Lincoln's push for the 13th Amendment, erasing the original sin of slavery from the land, was a liberal moment, as dramatized in Steven Spielberg's new film. Teddy Roosevelt's embrace of the income tax, eventually written into the Constitution after he left office, was a liberal moment. "No single device has done so much to secure the future of capitalism as this tax," said John Kenneth Galbraith.
Women's suffrage in 1920, Social Security in 1935, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 - all liberal moments. Ditto the creation of national parks, and laws against child labor and poisoning the environment, and for giving most Americans access to health care.
Democrats were the knuckle-draggers on race and populist economic reform in the 19th century, Republicans in the latter half of the 20th. The party identities change; the arc of enlightenment does not. 
Which brings us to the fascinating self-portrait of the United States at the start of the second half of the Obama era. A tenuous center-left majority wants to restore some equality to the outsize imbalance between the very rich and the rest of us. If a tenuous president can lead that coalition, without overreaching, he might be remembered among the greats. 
In its simplest form, this will involve raising taxes at the high end and reforming entitlements enough to ensure their continued success and sustainability. Much of that, an accountant could do. But it takes a gifted politician for the heavier lifting. That leader will have to make his still-fledgling health care act work and earn his premature Nobel Peace Prize on an issue like climate change. In the process, he could restore the good name to traditional liberalism.
For at least a generation's time, liberals in this country have been afraid to call themselves liberal. Was it the excesses of their creed, from race-based preferential programs that went on far too long to crude speech censorship by the politically correct and humorless (one and the same) that soiled the brand? In blindly embracing, say, the teachers' union in the face of overwhelming evidence that public education needs a jolt or in never questioning the efficacy of government programs, the left earned its years in exile. 
Or was it the relentless campaign by the broadcasting and publishing empires of the far right, associating liberals with tyranny, spiritual vacuity and baby killing, that drove people from the label that could not speak its name? "Godless," "Treason" and "Demonic" are actual Ann Coulter book titles, and a representative sample of the profitable cartooning of liberals. 
Liberalism, in the broadest sense, is about expanding human rights and opportunity, while embracing science and reason. What do they call the secularists in Egypt today pushing for democracy over a theocracy? Liberals.
The Progressives of the early 20th had an amazing run - direct elections of senators, regulation of monopolistic trusts, modernization of public schools, cleaning up the food supply - with only one major blooper: Prohibition.
The New Deal's lasting legacy, Social Security, and its counterpart of the 1960s, Medicare, allowed millions of American to live out their lives in dignity. Those programs, attacked as socialistic abominations by the Fox News shills of their day, are now considered near sacrosanct by Americans of all political stripes.
Conservatives of the last decade lost their way by rejecting science, immigration reform and personal freedom, particularly in regard to choices made by women and gays. If you believe in climate change, finding a path to citizenship for millions of hard-working Hispanics and the right to marry the person you love, there is no place in the Republican Party of 2012 for you.
Their neo-con wing started a pair of disastrous wars that all but bankrupted the country. And for leaders, at least on television, the party put forth crackpots like Rick Santorum, Sarah Palin, Michele Bachmann and the morally elastic Newt Gingrich. This chorus promoted an orthodoxy that forced this year's standard-bearer, Mitt Romney, to sound even more out of touch than he already was.
All political moments are ephemeral. This one could vanish in the blink of a donkey's eye. But here it is: a chance to shore up a battered middle class, make the promise of health care expansion work and do something about a planet in peril. Huge tasks, of course, and fraught with risk. For now, the majority of Americans have Obama's back. But should he fail, the same majority could become something much worse - a confederacy of cynics.

HEADLINE: Kia Forte: The Big Questions Remain Unanswered

BYLINE: JERRY GARRETT


HIGHLIGHT: The new Kia Forte looks handsome, but as with all Kia and Hyundai models, what kind of mileage will it actually get? 

 BODY:
 Introduced on Wednesday: 2014 Kia Forte
 What it is: Be honest, what name do you prefer for this new Kia sedan: Forte, Cerato or K3 saloon? Hyundai Elantra is already taken. Those are the names by which this car - or other iterations of it - is known in other parts of the world. 
 What it isn't: It isn't ugly. In fact, it's quite handsome. But, you know, the big question with any Kia or Hyundai these days is what kind of fuel mileage will it really get?
 What makes it tick? A 148-horsepower, 1.8-liter 4-cylinder engine and a 6-speed manual gearbox, with a 6-speed automatic transmission optional, comes in the base Forte LX. The Forte EX gets an upgrade to a 173-horsepower, 2-liter 4-cylinder that is paired with the only a 6-speed automatic. In what comes as not a complete surprise, fuel economy numbers were not announced here.
 How much, how soon? Prices also weren't announced. But it does go on sale in the United States in early 2013. The K3 saloon is already being sold in Korea.
 Our take: With Kia and Hyundai facing so many unanswered questions after their recent admission of mileage overstatements -- from its effect on customer loyalty to the outcome of class-action suits -- styling seems the least of their worries.

HEADLINE: Wheelies: The Pow! Sock! Edition

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: The original Batmobile from the 1966 TV series "Batman" is going up for sale. 

 BODY:
In which we bring you motoring news from around the Web:
 Holy gavel, Batman! The car from the 1960s television show "Batman" is going on the auction block, the Barrett-Jackson auction house announced on Thursday. The car, the only 1955 Lincoln Futura concept car that was heavily modified by George Barris to become the original Batmobile, goes on the block Jan. 19 in Scottsdale, Ariz. The original Batmobile has been a part of Mr. Barris's personal collection since 1965, when he bought it from the Ford Motor Company for a dollar. Presumably, the car will bring a healthy return on his original investment. (The Los Angeles Times) 
 For the second successive year, the Chevrolet Volt has landed atop the Consumer Reports annual owner-satisfaction survey. The consumer magazine said that 92 percent of Volt owners said they would definitely buy the plug-in hybrid again, compared with 93 percent who said the same thing last year. "The Volt's two-year reign at the top of our satisfaction survey points to the continuing trend of owners' enthusiasm for cars that are fuel-efficient, especially as we see more and more hybrid and electric models hitting the market," Rik Paul, Consumer Reports' auto editor, said in a statement. Other fuel-efficient models that scored well were the Nissan Leaf and the Toyota Camry Hybrid, Prius and Prius C. (Reuters)
 If you want a Tesla and are budget conscious, get your order in now. Tesla Motors is raising the price of its Model S sedan by $2,500, the company has announced. The base price will be raised to $59,000, from $57,400, on Jan.1, the company said Thursday in a news release. Customers who have already ordered the cars for delivery after Jan. 1 will not be charged the higher price. "We believe it is a positive reflection on our design process and disciplined, long-term planning that enabled us to increase prices for the first time in four years at only half the rate of inflation," said George Blankenship, vice president of worldwide sales and ownership experience. "As a company we will always strive to deliver our customers the most innovative cars in the world while minimizing price increases as we have done today." (Bloomberg News)

HEADLINE: 2014 Mitsubishi Outlander: All New in a Pleasant-Enough Package

BYLINE: TORI TELLEM


HIGHLIGHT: The new Outlander has an updated 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine and a more potent 224-horsepower 3-liter V-6. 

 BODY:
 Introduced on Thursday: 2014 Mitsubishi Outlander
 What it is: It's the all-new version of the crossover, now in its third generation. 
 What it isn't: No one has asked me, "Hey, when is the new Mitsubishi Outlander coming out?" I guess what it isn't is anticipated. On that note, there's also a 2013 Outlander Sport Limited Edition, a nod to the automaker's 30 years in North America, if anyone's interested.
 What makes it tick: An updated 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine and a continuously variable transmission are standard on the ES and SE models, for 166 horsepower. The top-of-the-line GT will gain a more potent 224-horsepower 3-liter V-6 and a 6-speed automatic transmission. Mitsubishi has not yet released fuel-economy figures.
 How much, how soon: The company also hasn't announced pricing, but it should be similar to the previous edition, starting at less than $25,000. Dealerships should have it by mid-2013.
 Our take: The interior, exterior and engine are pleasant enough, there's seating for seven and it's loaded with advanced safety systems. Yet will the Outlander continue to barely fog a mirror?

HEADLINE: For Small Businesses, More Than Income Tax Rates Are at Stake in Deficit Talks

BYLINE: ROBB MANDELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: While most of the discussion about taxes is focused on the expiring Bush-era tax cuts, a host of other deductions and credits that directly affect small businesses are on the line - and on the table. 

 BODY:
This summer, executives at Gray Construction, a closely held company in Lexington, Ky., decided it was time for a new telephone system. Gray, which builds factories and other industrial projects, has about 500 employees in offices in California, North Carolina, and Alabama, and executives concluded that a new Internet-based phone system would pay for itself in lower long-distance call costs in just five years, said Scott Parker, who is the company's chief operating and financial officer and also an owner. 
The only question was when to purchase the system. "We met with our tax advisers and they said that if we could have it up and running by the end of the year, it would be much better than waiting until next year," Mr. Parker said. That's because as a relatively small business, Gray Construction can take advantage of Section 179 of the tax code, which allows small companies to fully expense many capital investments in just one year, instead of over at least five years. Since the recession, Congress has allowed companies to expense more investment under Section 179, but the cap fell sharply in 2012, and is scheduled to fall sharply again in 2013, to just $25,000. "We're able to write that phone system down faster by purchasing it in 2012 than if we purchased it in 2013," Mr. Parker said. The phone system was up and running by early November.
This is not the only business decision Gray Construction made with an eye on the possibility of higher taxes in 2013. The company is structured so that its profits pass directly to its shareholders, who pay the taxes on that profit when they file their individual returns. Mr. Parker said the company sold $3 million of its stock investments in order for its owners to take their capital gains this year rather than next year, when the capital gains rate for wealthy taxpayers will rise by at least 3.8 percent, the result of a provision in the Affordable Care Act. (If the Bush-era tax cuts on wealthier Americans expire, their rates for capital gains will increase another 5 percent.) "In many, many cases, we will repurchase those same stocks, many almost immediately," Mr. Parker said. "To us, it was sort of a no-brainer."
As lawmakers and presidential advisers prepare to haggle over the so-called fiscal cliff, some small businesses are making their own plans. And while most of the discussion about taxes right now is focused on the expiring Bush-era tax cuts on wages and capital gains, as well as dividends and estates, a host of other deductions and credits that directly affect small businesses are on the line - and on the table.
Section 179 Expensing: The depreciation provision that Gray Construction is taking advantage of this year is set to be trimmed from $139,000 in 2012 to $25,000 in 2013. In addition,the expensing of real estate purchases, made possible by 2010's Small Business Jobs Act, will no longer be permitted. "At that level, it's really too low to provide much bang for the buck to businesses in terms of being able to deduct expenses for purchases," said Chris Whitcomb, tax counsel for the National Federation of Independent Business, the lobbying group. (For investments made in 2011, companies could immediately expense up to $500,000.) But Mr. Whitcomb notes that both the House and Senate support maintaining at least the current Section 179 expensing limit for 2013. "I'm optimistic that 179 will be at some higher level next year," Mr. Whitcomb said.
Executives at Gray Construction weren't willing to take that risk. "We chose the path of let's deal with what we know, and let's not speculate about what we don't know," Mr. Parker said. But for those willing to bet on having at least the same expensing limit in 2013, the decision on when to make an investment that would trigger the expensing rules hinges on how well the company anticipates it will do next year, said Grafton Willey, an accountant in Providence with the accounting firm CBIZ Tofias and a trustee of the National Small Business Association, another lobbying group. If next year looks to be as good or better than this year, take the expenses next year, said Mr. Willey, who believes that limits for expensing will rise in 2013.
Bonus Depreciation: Since 2008, companies have been able to take advantage of a special depreciation allowance that allows them to write off 50 percent (and sometimes more) of certain kinds of investment in the first year. The provision is especially helpful to companies too big to take advantage of Section 179 (which is only available to companies with total capital purchases under a certain threshold - $560,000 in 2012), but it is set to expire at the end of this year.
The Research and Experimentation Tax Credit: The R&D tax credit, as it's also known, expired at the end of 2011. Economists debate the merits of providing an incentive for an activity that technology-driven businesses are likely to undertake anyway, but this so-called temporary credit has been extended 13 times.
Built-in gains tax: Normally, when a company converts from a C corporation to an S corporation, it must retain its assets for at least 10 years or pay a 35-percent tax on the built-in capital gains that occurred before the company made the conversion. (The provision is intended to discourage a corporation from making the conversion simply to avoid double taxation - first at the corporate level, then at the shareholder level - on capital gains.) Since 2009, Congress has shortened the period, first to seven years for assets sold in 2009 and 2010, and then to five years for assets sold in 2011. Mr. Whitcomb, of the N.F.I.B., expects the more lenient built-in gains treatment will be revived for 2012 and 2013 as part of a last-minute deal.
Temporary exclusion of 100 percent of gain on certain small-business stock: This provision, an incentive to invest in small companies by making the capital gains tax-free, is yet another creature of recent stimulus laws that has been expanded over the last few years, and like the others, it also expired at the end of last year. However, its fate is murkier. "It's not a bad idea, just one that hasn't generated a lot of consideration," said Mr. Willey, the accountant.
Work opportunity tax credits: These are tax credits for employers who hire military veterans or people belonging to certain disadvantaged groups (for example, people receiving government assistance or living in distressed areas). Tax credits for hiring the disadvantaged expired in 2011; the tax credits for hiring veterans expire at the end of this year.
Fifteen-year depreciation for qualified improvements to leasehold, retail or restaurant property: We're getting deeper in the weeds here, but without this provision, which expired in 2011, a renter, retailer, or restaurateur has to write off improvements over 39 years, longer than one might realistically expect to be in business (or renting at the same location).
Enhanced charitable deduction for donating computer equipment: Still deeper in the weeds, this provision allowed C corporations the opportunity to donate computer equipment to schools and libraries and get a bigger deduction for it. The provision expired in 2011.
In addition, new tax rules and laws take effect in 2012 and 2013, among them several provisions of the Affordable Care Act (including the surtax on capital gains for the wealthy). Some people, particularly opponents of these new provisions, would like to see them on the negotiators' agenda.
So which of these incentives will get a new lease on life? Mr. Willey said that apart perhaps from the Section 179 rules, all of them are in jeopardy, because the main fight is over the tax rates. "I don't think we'll know until New Year's Eve," he said.

HEADLINE: Dropping the Ball on Financial Regulation

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: The opportunity to choose strong reformers to head key agencies may yield to the goal of pleasing prominent people in the financial sector, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Simon Johnson is the Ronald A. Kurtz Professor of Entrepreneurship at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management and co-author of "White House Burning: The Founding Fathers, Our National Debt, and Why It Matters to You." 
With regard to financial reform, the outcome of the November election seems straightforward. At the presidential level, the too-big-to-fail banks bet heavily on Mitt Romney and lost; President Obama received relatively few contributions from the financial sector, in contrast to 2008. In Senate races, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Sherrod Brown of Ohio demonstrated that it was possible to win not just without Wall Street money but against Wall Street money.
More broadly, this political shift coincides with and matches a significant change of views within the regulatory community. To pick these up, you need to listen carefully, but the signs are unmistakable. 
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is firmly in the hands of sensible people. The Federal Reserve governor Daniel Tarullo is making all the right noises, including about the need for a cap on the nondeposit liabilities of our largest banks. Even Bill Dudley, the president of the New York Fed and a former Goldman Sachs executive, now acknowledges that too-big-to-fail is still with us. If the New York Fed is getting past denial, we are making progress. 
At the Treasury Department, however, the tone and the content of messages on financial reform sound increasingly discordant. Recent signals suggest that appeasing powerful players within the financial sector is still high on the agenda for Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner.

See, for example, the recent decision to exempt foreign-exchange swaps and forwards from the rules that will apply to most other over-the-counter derivative transactions. Read the response by Dennis Kelleher of Better Markets; he is exactly on target, as usual. I join him in recommending the reporting by Silla Brush of Bloomberg News on the issue.
The highest-profile issue remains the process to appoint a new chairman at the Securities and Exchange Commission. As anticipated in my post two weeks ago, Mary Schapiro announced on Monday that she would step down as chairwoman. Elisse Walter, already an S.E.C. commissioner, was immediately named as interim chairwoman - a step that many reformers saw as reasonable. This means that the president has some time to get a new chairman lined up; there is no need for a rushed decision.
The Treasury Department appears to have backed away from its earlier support for Mary Miller, and she is now reported to have withdrawn. She would have been a weak and inappropriate candidate, as I explained in my post last week.
The Treasury's new candidate is Sallie Krawcheck, a former executive in the financial services industry. The campaign to appoint Ms. Krawcheck is already in full swing, and she is currently visiting people on Capitol Hill. Ms. Krawcheck is known to be good on the need to reform money markets - a key issue for the S.E.C. going forward. She has also been critical of management in some of our largest banks, at least in what she says on Twitter.
This week she supported Charles Schwab's reform proposal for money market funds. It's surprising that a potential nominee for such a prominent policy position is allowed to tweet. But perhaps it is also helpful, as we know very little about what she would do as S.E.C. chairwoman.
Ms. Krawcheck, who held senior positions at Bank of America and Citigroup, is on the advisory board of Gold Bullion International - a company that makes it easy for investors to own gold and other precious metals. Perhaps her experience and current position mean she has a healthy skepticism about the debt and equity currently on offer from very large banks.
But does she really understand how our financial system became so dangerous and what it would take to better protect investors? Ms. Krawcheck would be placed in charge of our principal markets regulator and made responsible for setting its agenda and answering to Congress. Yet she has never been a regulator or prosecutor; she has never sought to craft rules or dealt with Congress. What about her purely industry-based background suggests that she would be capable of marshaling the S.E.C.'s formidable staff to follow through on her tweets? 
More broadly, what is Ms. Krawcheck's view on the reform agenda put forward in early October by Mr. Tarullo? Aside from her tweets and short comments, I have not seen any clear statement on policy priorities from her. Nor does her track record suggest which way she would go.
And whom would she hire as head of enforcement? The S.E.C. needs to get its game back. This organization is a distinguished safeguard of public interest that has fallen on hard times - mostly through deregulation, underfunding, industry capture and a revolving door. Continuing the turnaround begun under Ms. Schapiro will require expert skills and a strong vision. No one can be above the law - including the country's most powerful and best connected executives.
There is a huge political risk in this appointment. In terms of high-profile positions dealing with financial regulatory issues, the head of the S.E.C. ranks behind only the Fed chairman and the Treasury secretary.
Does President Obama want to make the same mistake at the S.E.C. that President George W. Bush made at the Federal Emergency Management Agency before Hurricane Katrina? Do his advisers want to wake up every morning worrying if an S.E.C. scandal or breakdown in competence or inappropriate wording will become what the second Obama term is remembered for? 
Anyone genuinely seeking to protect the president should want the strongest possible candidate - on his or her merits - for this position.
Ms. Schapiro helped stabilize the situation, but a great deal of work remains. Ms. Krawcheck's nomination would mostly be a way to make prominent people in the financial sector happy. Perhaps she would surprise them - and us - with real reform. But why play such games?
Some distinguished Americans are available to take the job of leading the S.E.C. I've written before about Neil Barofsky, Dennis Kelleher and Gary Gensler, the chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. I also heartily recommend Harvey J. Goldschmid, a former S.E.C. commissioner with an outstanding rsum on many fronts. (Disclosure: Mr. Goldschmid and I both serve in unpaid positions on the systemic risk council, founded by Sheila Bair.)
Ms. Bair would also be outstanding at the S.E.C. - although the country would be well served if she were to become our next Treasury secretary.
For a president serious about financial reform - including responsible policy and effective enforcement - the choice is simple. Nominate Ms. Bair as Treasury secretary and Mr. Barofsky, Mr. Goldschmid, Mr. Gensler or Mr. Kelleher as head of the S.E.C. 
We need to restore confidence in all dimensions of our public markets. Financial markets are far too important to be left to the financiers.

HEADLINE: The Early Word: Frustrations

BYLINE: ASHLEY SOUTHALL


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times, plus a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
 In Today's Times: 

        
As he travels the country trying to pressure Republicans on taxes, President Obama has been pretty quiet about what spending cuts he would support to resolve the fiscal impasse in Washington. Peter Baker notes that Mr. Obama's one-sided approach is causing consternation among Republicans and even some Democrats.
 

        
Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic majority leader, is going for the "nuclear option"-- proposing to change Senate rules to make it harder for the Republican minority to use the filibuster to stall or kill legislation and nominations. Jennifer Steinhauer reports that the Republicans are loyally opposed to the move while feelings are mixed among Democrats, many of whom are frustrated by Republicans' frequent use of the tool but wary of not having it available when they are in the minority someday.

        
With Republicans' political emotions running high over the Sept. 11 Benghazi attacks, misstatements about the administration's response have jumbled the career trajectories of two senior administration officials, Scott Shane reports. Besides galvanizing Republican opposition to Ambassador Susan E. Rice's potential nomination to be the next secretary of state, the tangled talking points have also muddied the path of Michael J. Morell, the acting director of the Central Intelligence Agency, to securing the agency's top job.

        
The Obama administration is likely to make a decision as early as next week on whether and how to help topple President Bashar al-Assad's government in Syria, David E. Sanger and Eric Schmitt report. They write that the administration is considering the risk to Americans and of setting off a larger conflict as it reviews its policy toward Syria.
 Happening in Washington: 

        
Economic data expected today include gross domestic product for the third quarter and weekly jobless claims at 8:30 a.m., followed at 10 by pending home sales for October and weekly mortgage rates.

        
At 10:30 a.m., Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton will deliver remarks in recognition of World AIDS Day at the State Department.

        
At 12:30 p.m., President Obama and Mitt Romney, his former Republican rival for the presidency, will have lunch together at the White House.

        
At 2 p.m., a House Financial Services subcommittee with jurisdiction over monetary policy will hold a hearing on potential savings from changing the metallic content of certain coins and from replacing the $1 bill with a $1 coin.

        
Also at 2, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee will have a hearing to examine the rise in autism diagnoses.

HEADLINE: Regulator Warns SAC Capital

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Regulators warn SAC Capital Advisors of a civil fraud lawsuit. | The field of potential candidates to lead the S.E.C. has shifted. | The Office of Financial Research may end up being "a tool of the financial services industry," Jesse Eisinger writes. | Chief executives who met with President Obama in Washington sound supportive of the president's approach to fiscal talks. 

 BODY:
The once-reclusive Steven A. Cohen has found himself thrust into the very public role of defending SAC Capital Advisors, his $14 billion hedge fund, against an intensifying government investigation.
 Regulators warned SAC that they were preparing to file a civil fraud lawsuit against the hedge fund, after years of investigating insider trading. The warning from the Securities and Exchange Commission, in the form of a so-called Wells notice, stems from a criminal insider trading case brought last week against a former SAC employee, and is "the boldest regulatory shot yet across SAC's bow," DealBook's Peter Lattman reports.
Clients learned the latest news during a conference call on Wednesday, when Mr. Cohen was in the unusual position of having to shore up investor support. "We take these matters very seriously, and I am confident that I acted appropriately," said Mr. Cohen, who has not been accused of wrongdoing. The case against the former employee, Mathew Martoma, is the first time the government has linked Mr. Cohen to questionable trades. 
Mr. Lattman reports: "A person briefed on the investigation said that an additional action against SAC, or even Mr. Cohen, could involve accusations of fraud based on the so-called controlled-liability theory, meaning that it was in 'control' of Mr. Martoma when he engaged in insider trading." SAC could survive possible penalties from an S.E.C. lawsuit, Mr. Lattman notes, but "the blow to its reputation could cause some investors to flee and prompt some banks to avoid doing business with it."
The government has an additional trader in its sights, whom Bloomberg News identifies as Phillipp Villhauer. He has not been accused of wrongdoing, but is featured anonymously in the complaints against SAC filed last week, Bloomberg News reports. As the case unfolds, William D. Cohan of Bloomberg Businessweek is taking a skeptical stance. He writes: "It's worth asking whether relentlessly hunting insider-trading suspects like Cohen is a wise use of the government's resources - especially considering that the people responsible for the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression continue to get off scot-free."
RACE TO LEAD S.E.C. SHIFTS | The field of potential candidates to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission has shifted, as Mary J. Miller, a senior Treasury Department official, has removed her name from consideration, DealBook reports. That makes Sallie L. Krawcheck, a longtime Wall Street executive, a potential front-runner. Ms. Krawcheck has emerged as a consumer advocate since leaving Bank of America last year, but she lacks government experience and may be seen as too close to the financial industry. Simon Johnson, a professor at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management, raises concerns about Ms. Krawcheck in a post on the Economix blog. The agency's next leader, expected to be named next year, would take over from Elisse B. Walter, who was chosen to succeed Mary L. Schapiro.
TOO MANY FRIENDLY FACES IN WASHINGTON? | The Office of Financial Research, a wonky agency created by the Dodd-Frank Act to monitor risks to the financial system, "is looking as if it will be a tool of the financial services industry, instead of a check on it," Jesse Eisinger writes in his column, The Trade. The agency, which has been slow to get off the ground, announced its advisory committee this month. Mr. Eisinger writes: "By my count, 19 of the 30 committee members work directly in financial services or for private sector entities that are dependent on the industry. There are academics, but many of them have lucrative ties to the financial services industry." The Treasury Department, which houses the fledgling agency, takes a different view. "We were looking for people with a range of perspectives who understand keenly the systemic risks in the financial system," said Neal S. Wolin, the Treasury deputy secretary.
 ON THE AGENDA | Two House Financial Services subcommittees are holding a joint hearing at 10 a.m. on the effect of proposed rules to comply with the international Basel standards on capital. Another House Financial Services subcommittee is conducting a hearing at 2 p.m. called "The Future of Money: Dollars and Sense." Barnes & Noble and Tiffany & Company report earnings before the opening bell. A revised estimate of gross domestic product in the third quarter is released at 8:30 a.m. Jeff Jordan, a general partner of Andreessen Horowitz, is on CNBC at 1:30 p.m. Janice Fukakusa, the chief financial officer and chief administrative officer of the Royal Bank of Canada, is on Bloomberg TV at 2:10 p.m. Antoine Drean, the chief executive of Palico, an online marketplace for private equity, is on Bloomberg TV at 5:10 p.m.
C.E.O.'S DESCEND ON WHITE HOUSE | President Obama has had a complicated relationship with the business world, to say the least. But chief executives who met with Mr. Obama on Wednesday came away sounding supportive of the president's approach to the fiscal negotiations in Washington. Lloyd C. Blankfein of Goldman Sachs said on CNBC that the president's plan was "very credible." He added, "I would say that an agreement was reachable." Mr. Blankfein and others said that tax increases would probably be part of a deal to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff.
Another financial chief, Larry Fink of BlackRock, has also been active in Washington as he considers his next job. Mr. Fink "has made little secret of his wish to join a second-term Obama administration as Treasury secretary," succeeding Timothy F. Geithner, The Financial Times writes. Mr. Fink and Mr. Geithner are friends, according to the newspaper, which reports: "In wishful moments, Mr. Fink may hope that some day, after he has left the Treasury, Mr. Geithner would consider joining BlackRock. But Mr. Fink appreciates that any conversation with Mr. Geithner about this while he is in his current position would be inappropriate."

HEADLINE: Regulator Warns SAC Capital

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Regulators warn SAC Capital Advisors of a civil fraud lawsuit. | The field of potential candidates to lead the S.E.C. has shifted. | The Office of Financial Research may end up being "a tool of the financial services industry," Jesse Eisinger writes. | Chief executives who met with President Obama in Washington sound supportive of the president's approach to fiscal talks. 

 BODY:
The once-reclusive Steven A. Cohen has found himself thrust into the very public role of defending SAC Capital Advisors, his $14 billion hedge fund, against an intensifying government investigation.
 Regulators warned SAC that they were preparing to file a civil fraud lawsuit against the hedge fund, after years of investigating insider trading. The warning from the Securities and Exchange Commission, in the form of a so-called Wells notice, stems from a criminal insider trading case brought last week against a former SAC employee, and is "the boldest regulatory shot yet across SAC's bow," DealBook's Peter Lattman reports.
Clients learned the latest news during a conference call on Wednesday, when Mr. Cohen was in the unusual position of having to shore up investor support. "We take these matters very seriously, and I am confident that I acted appropriately," said Mr. Cohen, who has not been accused of wrongdoing. The case against the former employee, Mathew Martoma, is the first time the government has linked Mr. Cohen to questionable trades. 
Mr. Lattman reports: "A person briefed on the investigation said that an additional action against SAC, or even Mr. Cohen, could involve accusations of fraud based on the so-called controlled-liability theory, meaning that it was in 'control' of Mr. Martoma when he engaged in insider trading." SAC could survive possible penalties from an S.E.C. lawsuit, Mr. Lattman notes, but "the blow to its reputation could cause some investors to flee and prompt some banks to avoid doing business with it."
The government has an additional trader in its sights, whom Bloomberg News identifies as Phillipp Villhauer. He has not been accused of wrongdoing, but is featured anonymously in the complaints against SAC filed last week, Bloomberg News reports. As the case unfolds, William D. Cohan of Bloomberg Businessweek is taking a skeptical stance. He writes: "It's worth asking whether relentlessly hunting insider-trading suspects like Cohen is a wise use of the government's resources - especially considering that the people responsible for the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression continue to get off scot-free."
RACE TO LEAD S.E.C. SHIFTS | The field of potential candidates to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission has shifted, as Mary J. Miller, a senior Treasury Department official, has removed her name from consideration, DealBook reports. That makes Sallie L. Krawcheck, a longtime Wall Street executive, a potential front-runner. Ms. Krawcheck has emerged as a consumer advocate since leaving Bank of America last year, but she lacks government experience and may be seen as too close to the financial industry. Simon Johnson, a professor at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management, raises concerns about Ms. Krawcheck in a post on the Economix blog. The agency's next leader, expected to be named next year, would take over from Elisse B. Walter, who was chosen to succeed Mary L. Schapiro.
TOO MANY FRIENDLY FACES IN WASHINGTON? | The Office of Financial Research, a wonky agency created by the Dodd-Frank Act to monitor risks to the financial system, "is looking as if it will be a tool of the financial services industry, instead of a check on it," Jesse Eisinger writes in his column, The Trade. The agency, which has been slow to get off the ground, announced its advisory committee this month. Mr. Eisinger writes: "By my count, 19 of the 30 committee members work directly in financial services or for private sector entities that are dependent on the industry. There are academics, but many of them have lucrative ties to the financial services industry." The Treasury Department, which houses the fledgling agency, takes a different view. "We were looking for people with a range of perspectives who understand keenly the systemic risks in the financial system," said Neal S. Wolin, the Treasury deputy secretary.
 ON THE AGENDA | Two House Financial Services subcommittees are holding a joint hearing at 10 a.m. on the effect of proposed rules to comply with the international Basel standards on capital. Another House Financial Services subcommittee is conducting a hearing at 2 p.m. called "The Future of Money: Dollars and Sense." Barnes & Noble and Tiffany & Company report earnings before the opening bell. A revised estimate of gross domestic product in the third quarter is released at 8:30 a.m. Jeff Jordan, a general partner of Andreessen Horowitz, is on CNBC at 1:30 p.m. Janice Fukakusa, the chief financial officer and chief administrative officer of the Royal Bank of Canada, is on Bloomberg TV at 2:10 p.m. Antoine Drean, the chief executive of Palico, an online marketplace for private equity, is on Bloomberg TV at 5:10 p.m.
C.E.O.'S DESCEND ON WHITE HOUSE | President Obama has had a complicated relationship with the business world, to say the least. But chief executives who met with Mr. Obama on Wednesday came away sounding supportive of the president's approach to the fiscal negotiations in Washington. Lloyd C. Blankfein of Goldman Sachs said on CNBC that the president's plan was "very credible." He added, "I would say that an agreement was reachable." Mr. Blankfein and others said that tax increases would probably be part of a deal to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff.
Another financial chief, Larry Fink of BlackRock, has also been active in Washington as he considers his next job. Mr. Fink "has made little secret of his wish to join a second-term Obama administration as Treasury secretary," succeeding Timothy F. Geithner, The Financial Times writes. Mr. Fink and Mr. Geithner are friends, according to the newspaper, which reports: "In wishful moments, Mr. Fink may hope that some day, after he has left the Treasury, Mr. Geithner would consider joining BlackRock. But Mr. Fink appreciates that any conversation with Mr. Geithner about this while he is in his current position would be inappropriate."

HEADLINE: Europe Moves to Curb Power of Ratings Agencies, Sort Of

BYLINE: HARVEY MORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: European officials have hailed the adoption of new rules to curb the power of the U.S.-based "big three" ratings agencies, but Europe seems to have given up on the idea of replacing them. 

 BODY:
LONDON - European legislators this week struck the latest blow in the Continent's battle with the international ratings agencies by approving new controls that one commentator said on Thursday marked the end of their "golden age."
The measures follow a string of downgrades of the sovereign debt of European states that have dented national pride as much as the ability of governments to raise money in the marketplace. 
The plan principally targets the "big three" U.S.-based agencies - Fitch, Moody's, and Standard & Poor's - which are accused by their European critics of exercising too much power and not enough responsibility in assessing national and corporate debt.
They have been accused of exacerbating Europe's debt woes by issuing downgrades at delicate moments of the euro crisis, and their judgment has been challenged over the top scores they awarded to doubtful debt ahead of the 2008 financial meltdown.
In the latest downgrade, Moody's last week took away France's prized AAA rating, citing the country's loss of competitiveness and excessive regulation.
Under measures approved by the European Parliament and awaiting endorsement by European Union governments, the agencies face new rules that include making it easier for investors to sue them if they get it wrong.
In a possible foretaste of that, prosecutors in southern Italy were reported to have called for seven executives at Standard & Poor's and Fitch to be tried over downgrades that were made to Italy's sovereign debt rating last year. 
"In tough times it's natural that people are looking for a scapegoat for all the turmoil," Management Today, a British business news Web site, said of the Italian case.
Standard & Poor's reportedly dismissed the Italian claims as "entirely baseless and without any merit." 
The latest moves in Europe came after the big three warned that the United States could be facing its own downgrade as it approaches the so-called fiscal cliff. 
The measures approved by the European Parliament would bar the agencies from rating corporate or national debt if they did not have sufficient quality information on which to base their findings. 
They would also be subject to a timetable of when they could publish their unsolicited assessments of European debt.
The new rules would also bar agencies from rating companies in which their shareholders have a major stake. That could prevent ratings being issued on Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. by Moody's, an agency in which the Sage of Omaha has a 12.75 percent stake.
The Financial Times questioned how such rules will be implemented in practice and how they would apply to ratings in the United States.
Michel Barnier, Europe's internal market commissioner, welcomed agreement on rules that aimed to reduce "the over-reliance on ratings, eradicate conflicts of interest, and establish a civil liability regime." 
rating agency deal: shares max 5% in case cross-shareholding of agencies. no rating allowed of products own shareholder above 10% of shares.
- Michel Barnier (@MBarnierEU) November 27, 2012
Others were more skeptical about the impact of what, in the end, was a compromise deal that did not go as far as some European critics of the agencies wanted. 
"This reform is no big breakthrough in changing the rating agency market," Sven Giegold, a German member of the European parliament, told Reuters. "It's a step towards better supervision but there are no big structural changes."
Les Echos, the French business daily, also suggested that the Europeans appeared to have lost interest in setting up their own rival agency to replace the big three. It said there was no longer much talk about that project, which the European Commission is due to report on in 2016.
Norbert Gaillard, an economist who specializes in the sector, said many investors were concerned about the creation of a public or quasi-public agency that would have to be set up from scratch.
"You might as well say it's been put in the cupboard and will never see the light of day," he told Les Echos.

HEADLINE: Pete La Roca Sims, 74, Postbop Drummer

BYLINE: By NATE CHINEN

 BODY:
Pete La Roca Sims, a powerful and distinctive drummer who created the pulse for some of jazz's leading figures from the late 1950s through the '60s, died on Nov. 20 in Manhattan. He was 74.
The cause was lung cancer, said his daughter, Susan Sims. 
With an effervescent time feel and an alert style that could turn an accompanying role into a running commentary, Mr. Sims was well suited to the dynamism of the postbop era.
''He was for me very, very easy to play with,'' the pianist Steve Kuhn, a regular collaborator in the early 1960s, said last week. ''His influences were what they were, but he synthesized them. His conception was unique.''
Working as Pete La Roca, Mr. Sims appeared on a handful of classic albums of the period, notably by the tenor saxophonists Sonny Rollins and Joe Henderson. ''Basra,'' an album he made for Blue Note in 1965, leading a quartet with Mr. Henderson, Mr. Kuhn and the bassist Steve Swallow, is itself widely regarded as a classic.
Mr. Sims also recorded memorably with the alto saxophonist Jackie McLean, the trumpeter Art Farmer, the pianist Paul Bley and others. His second album as a leader, ''Turkish Women at the Bath,'' released in 1967, featured John Gilmore of the Sun Ra Arkestra on tenor saxophone and Chick Corea on piano.
Peter Sims was born on April 7, 1938, in Manhattan. He grew up in Harlem, surrounded by jazz: his stepfather was a trumpeter, and his uncle managed a suite of rehearsal studios. Mr. Sims had his first professional experience as a timbale player on the Latin dance-band circuit, where he adopted his stage surname, La Roca (''the Rock'').
He transitioned to the drum kit at 17. Two years later, on the recommendation of the pioneering bebop drummer Max Roach, he played what he would later recall as his first jazz engagement, with Mr. Rollins. Part of that performance would be immortalized on Mr. Rollins's ''Night at the Village Vanguard,'' one of the bedrock live albums in jazz, though the drummer on most of the tracks is Elvin Jones.
During the spring and summer of 1960, Mr. Sims worked in an early iteration of the John Coltrane Quartet. He was similarly a short-lived founding member of Stan Getz's acclaimed early-'60s quartet. (His replacement in the Coltrane band was Mr. Jones; in the Getz ensemble, it was Roy Haynes.)
Though he brushed up against experimentalism, free jazz held little appeal for Mr. Sims, and jazz-rock even less. This, combined with his growing impatience with sideman work, gradually resulted in dwindling opportunities. He drove a taxi for five years while studying law at New York University, and then became a contract lawyer. (When ''Turkish Women at the Bath'' was reissued without permission under Mr. Corea's name, as ''Bliss!,'' he successfully sued.)
Mr. Sims bristled at the widely held perception that he had abandoned music to become a lawyer. The truth, he said, was that he would have continued to work as a musician if there had been more opportunities to play the kind of music he wanted to play -- and that as soon as it became economically feasible to balance his music and law careers, he resumed performing.
He began playing semi-regularly again in 1979, using his real last name and mentoring younger musicians, notably the saxophonist David Liebman. And he doubled down on his stubborn adherence to swing rhythm. The name of his working band was Swingtime; that was also the title of his final album, released on Blue Note in 1997.
Mr. Sims's marriage to the former Margo Burroughs ended in divorce. In addition to his daughter, a blues singer and drummer, Mr. Sims is survived by his son, Kenneth Harvey, and his brother, Michael Morgan.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Let's Stick Together

BYLINE: By GORDON BROWN

 BODY:
WHEN I was asked a few years ago what the financial crisis taught me, I replied, ''It's the global economy, stupid.'' Well, what I actually said was it taught me that ''global problems need global solutions.''
I would now go further: My 13 years in government have taught me that the pre-eminent international issue is whether we can develop a level of global cooperation that matches the global dimension of our problems.
We need little proof that our world is more interdependent than ever. As Britain's prime minister in 2008, I saw how reverberations from a banking collapse anywhere can affect stability everywhere. I found that leaders, who previously had talked only intermittently, were in constant telephone contact. As chairman of the G-20 at the height of the crisis, I found myself working the phones on a near 24-hour cycle, moving through time zones from Asia to America.
Since then, we've seen how a nuclear disaster in Japan can send shock waves across every land; how economic difficulties in Greece can hurt confidence across the globe; how protectionism in just a few countries can disrupt the whole of world trade. 
We've also seen evidence that international cooperation on economic issues is not working well. The year 2009 should have brought an era of enhanced cooperation. Instead, that cooperation hit a high-water mark, then receded. Global coordination is still regarded by too many countries as an optional extra, a sideshow compared with domestic issues.
From my own experience I can see that there are changes we can make, institutional reforms we can embrace, and specific policies that we can adopt that would improve cooperation and make for a far healthier, more prosperous world.
Let me focus on the five great economic and social challenges of our time -- all global in nature, all requiring coordinated action, all matters on which the world community has been called upon to act but has failed to do so effectively: financial stability, climate change, global growth, open trade and the Millennium Development Goals.
The failure to coordinate global finance
Given the global financial crisis -- which cost $4 trillion in lost output and an estimated 28 million jobs, as well as surging debt and deficits (much of the cost borne by countries, businesses and individuals who did not directly cause the crisis) -- the case for global financial coordination is indisputable.
As Mark Carney, the chairman of the Financial Stability Board set up in 2009 to monitor and make recommendations about the global financial system, has said, ''Given the reality of global finance, it is not enough to have our own house in order -- unless we seal ourselves off from the world, and if we were to do that we will end up much poorer. An open, resilient global financial system will be central to the transformation of the global economy. In order to achieve that, financial sector reform is a must.''
Yet while much has been promised, Europe, America, Switzerland and other financial centers are today regrettably agreeing to their own separate and distinctive financial regimes. The world is at risk of a race to the bottom in financial standards, with the good undercut by the bad and the bad by the worst.
There has yet to be agreement on the oversight and regulation of shadow banking, the terms of securitization, how money-market funds are managed, and how we manage the links between the regulated banking sector and shadow banks.
The failure to coordinate global action on climate change
No matter what action a nation seeks to take on climate change, its policy outcomes are influenced by other nations.
When Copenhagen failed in December 2009, it was not because of a failure to reach any agreements. In fact, we achieved agreements in four major areas -- on national carbon-reduction plans, on transparency requirements, on immediate help for poorer countries to mitigate climate damage, and on a long-term framework for transferring resources from rich to poor.
Yet because we could not agree on a treaty or even on an overall framework we could not usher in what was needed -- a carbon price guaranteeing sustained investment in renewable industries. The result is that aside from China (where a state decision has been made to sponsor renewables) investment in that industry is flagging. While there was some progress in Durban, South Africa, with an agreement about standards on transparency, and in Cancn, Mexico, where new standards were set for corporate social responsibility, the much-promised decade of low carbon investment has been postponed, a victim of an international failure to agree.
The failure to coordinate growth strategy
The world is also unable to agree on what to do about stalled global growth amid the fallout from the euro zone crisis. In 2009, when world leaders agreed on a bold strategy, I and others insisted that first aid measures were not enough. The G-20's Action Plan included a commitment by its members to coordinate fiscal, monetary, trade and structural policies and to use the I.M.F.'s mutual assessment process as its vehicle.
What was intended to be a global growth pact quickly bogged down in ''currency wars.'' The result is that growth is much lower than it need be and I estimate we have lost between 25 and 50 million jobs. Much-needed global initiatives, such as an infrastructure plan to mobilize private savings and generate higher growth, are stillborn.
The failure to secure a world trade agreement
Negotiations on a new world trade round have also broken down. Some may argue that it's impossible to agree on what to do because the nature of imports and exports -- and of global supply chains -- is changing so fast. Yet each successful trade round since the 1940s has had to deal with a rapidly changing world.
Today the world is being remade yet again. Intra-Asian trade, which is now about a third of intra-European trade, will surpass European trade before 2030. China, which has less than 5 percent of world trade today, will have 15 percent by 2030. India's share will rise from less than 2 percent to 5 percent.
Given their need to sell to rising Asian markets, my view is that more than ever before free trade is in the interests of America and Europe. Yet we face the prospect that, for the first time in 40 years of trade negotiations, protectionist pressures will make a world trade deal impossible.
The failure to deliver the millennium development goals
In 2000 every major world leader and every significant international institution agreed to deliver, by 2015, education for every child, a two-thirds reduction in infant mortality, and a three-quarters reduction in maternal mortality on top of a halving of poverty in every continent. They promised to secure gender equality by 2005.
Despite big progress in reducing poverty in China, none of these bold health and education goals are on track to being met. One reason I have accepted the U.N. secretary general's offer to be his special envoy for global education is that, unless we fast track resources to meeting these goals from now to the end of 2015, one generation's betrayal will haunt the next. The credibility of the post-2015 goals will depend on how much we do in the next three years to meet the current goals.
In five central areas where policy coordination is essential, the world has not moved forward with sufficient force; indeed, in certain important respects it has moved backward.
Where are the powerful, globally minded voices that can do something about this?
Certainly, what China does will matter more than ever before. Zheng Bijian, a prominent adviser to the government in Beijing, argues that there is now a ''convergence of interests'' across the world but that the immediate challenge is whether global governance can be established without one dominant power or set of interests insisting on calling the shots. In other words, China wants global cooperation to work. It does not want to overturn the current global system, but to reform it, and it wants America and Europe to engage in that process of reform without trying to dominate it.
Events, however, are forcing Europe to retreat from its long-held desire to deliver a joint approach to global cooperation. While emerging markets outside Asia want to embrace global economic integration, at least in theory, Brazil and South Africa are not especially interventionist on global issues, and India and Russia, both with historically strong world-views, have become self-absorbed. When the BRICS meet, their lofty communiqus disguise widespread internal disagreements about how to engage. This is also true in the United States, where people are divided not so much on whether America should engage in the world, but on what terms.
In every country, politicians are having to deal with the nationalist and protectionist impulses that arise in difficult economic times. In a recent study of global public opinion, Jeffery Sellers of the University of Southern California found that there is a shift -- not toward a stronger sense of global or even national citizenship, but to a ''stronger territorial attachment'' at the local level.
Problems may be increasingly global but politics remains local. I've found to my cost that while I talked to domestic audiences about the benefits of global cooperation, there were far more votes in redefining a global problem -- low growth -- as a national problem -- high public debt. Even when a problem was beyond the control of one country's leadership, it was much easier politics to hold the national government responsible.
A pessimistic conclusion would be that governments will turn to international action only when they are unable to solve domestic problems by the old methods. I am far more optimistic, not least because we have had some experience of global action that has worked.
Nevertheless, international institutions built in 1945 are now wholly inadequate for the challenges of a global economy. We must make the I.M.F. a more effective tool for global surveillance, give the G-20 teeth to coordinate international economic policy, ensure that all non-G-20 countries are included in consultations; and set detailed timetables for agreements on global bank rules, on growth and trade, and on fast-tracking progress toward the Millennium Development Goals.
The stakes are high, our collective prospects depend on what we do. Despite our first faltering steps to forge the first truly global civilization, the prize is great. Without diminishing the vitality of our national identities, we are on the way to creating the first global system of governance.

HEADLINE: Turning Points

BYLINE: By NIALL FERGUSON

 BODY:
WE yearn for turning points. Just as economists have predicted nine out of the last five recessions, so journalists have surely reported nine out of the last five revolutions. Every election is hailed as epoch-making. Every president is expected to have a new foreign policy ''doctrine.'' A minor redesign of a cellular phone is hailed by the devotees of the Apple cult as a ''paradigm shift.''
The point about paradigm shifts, as Thomas Kuhn pointed out in ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions,'' is that they don't happen every other year. They are slow, because even when a new insight is right -- dazzlingly right in hindsight -- vested interests and other forms of inertia resist its adoption. The same is true for big political discontinuities. They just don't happen that often.
In 2012 there were a whole bunch of elections, not only in the United States but also in France, Mexico, the Netherlands, Russia, South Korea, Taiwan and Venezuela. In China a new standing committee of the Politburo was named, after a selection process so opaque as to be papal. 
In countries like Egypt, Libya and Yemen, there was no mistaking the revolutionary character of the change as the misnamed Arab Spring continued its evolution into an Islamist Winter. But in other places the political changes hardly qualified as turning points. In France a jaded Left mounted one last feeble rally against economic reality. In Mexico the old regime, in the form of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, returned to power. Contrary to expectations, anti-European populists lost in Holland and the genial Mark Rutte was re-elected. In Russia, Vladimir Putin abandoned his pretense of being prime minister and returned to his real job as president. Turning points? Turn over and go back to sleep.
The great English historian A.J.P. Taylor said of the year 1848 that ''German history reached its turning point and failed to turn.'' This verdict could in fact be applied to most countries in most years.
History is like an oil tanker. It does not turn on a dime. Mankind sails forward through time in seas that are sometimes calm, sometimes stormy. At times it seems almost becalmed, at other times it can do 12 knots. Depending on who captains the ship, it veers sometimes to port, sometimes to starboard. When it changes direction, the turn is generally slow.
The things that change suddenly on an oil tanker are the emotions of the crew. Nine hundred and ninety-nine days out of a thousand, they obey their orders and do their work. But very occasionally there is a drama. The men mutiny and the captain is clapped in irons. Or pirates board the ship. Such events are what historians love to study and call ''revolutions.'' Still, the ship plows onward.
In other words, do not expect 1989 to happen every year -- and don't exaggerate how big a turning point even 1989 was. Nearly a quarter of a century ago, Francis Fukuyama hailed ''an unabashed victory of economic and political liberalism... the Triumph of the West.''
It seemed so true. Who could forget the thrill of that night -- Nov. 9, 1989 -- when the Cold War ended not with Armageddon but with a street party? Yet, as I write, the People's Republic of China is poised to overtake the United States in terms of gross domestic product (adjusted for differences in purchasing power) in 2017. If you invested in the West in 1989 you fared much worse than if you had invested in the Rest. Emerging stock markets have risen by a factor of five since 1989; the U.S. market, fourfold; Europe, less than threefold.
One attractively simple way of thinking about the world is to say that wealth, and with it power, are shifting from the West to the Rest. In that sense, the real turning point was not 1989 but 1979, the year Deng Xiaoping visited the United States and China's economic reforms began in earnest. From that point, the ''great divergence'' of the West from the Rest came to an end, and the world embarked on a ''great reconvergence.''
But the reality is more complicated than suggested by phrases like ''the post-American world.''
There are six slow-acting drivers of historical change in our time, as in most of recorded history. A common error is to focus on only one. They are:
1. Technological innovation;
2. The spread of ideas and institutions;
3. The tendency of even good political systems to degenerate;
4. Demographics;
5. Supplies of essential commodities;
6. Climate change.
The first three essentially explain why the West has lost some of its predominance. But the others remind us that, in that wonderful line often attributed to Bismarck, ''a special Providence watches over children, drunkards and the United States of America.''
Measured (crudely) in terms of international patents granted by country of origin of applicant, the West no longer leads. Japan has been out in front of the United States for nearly 20 years and, in the past decade, first South Korea and then China have overtaken Germany to take the third and fourth places.
Measured (less crudely) with standardized tests of mathematical attainment at age 15, the West has also slipped. In the most recent report, published by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the gap between teenagers from the Shanghai District of China and those from the United States was as big as the gap between the Americans and their Albanian contemporaries. The silver medal went to young mathematicians from Singapore, the bronze to their counterparts in Hong Kong, then came South Korea, followed by Taiwan. Proficiency at math isn't everything, of course, but societies that teach the average student so much better than the West does are probabilistically more likely to turn raw genius (which is pretty randomly distributed through humanity) into Nobel prizes.
The third driver of change -- nearly always overlooked by political scientists -- is the tendency of even the best systems to degenerate as rent-seeking special interests grow on the body politic like barnacles on a ship's hull, and civic virtue yields to human frailty. Westerners are justly proud of their various democratic systems, and Americans in particular regard their Constitution as the world's best. Yet every comparative study of institutional quality -- from the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Index to the World Bank's Worldwide Governance Indicators -- tells the same depressing story. In many Western countries there has been a perceptible decline in the rule of law. Among the worst cases are South European ''cradles of democracy,'' Greece and Italy, which receive shockingly bad scores from the World Economic Forum. In the United States, meanwhile, the World Bank reports marked declines since 2000 in the control of corruption, regulatory quality, accountability and government effectiveness.
This ''great degeneration'' helps explain the slowdown in growth and productivity we have witnessed in the West in the past decade. We cannot blame it solely on the financial crisis, nor on the fact that (as the economist Robert Gordon recently argued) the information technology revolution has delivered much less than its own hype led us to expect. The world is changing not just because the Rest have got better, but also because -- quite independently -- the West has got worse. Indeed, much of the developed world today reminds me of what Adam Smith said about China in ''The Wealth of Nations'': It has reached a ''stationary'' state in which growth is near zero and prosperity is enjoyed only by a corrupt bureaucratic elite.
Nevertheless, there are three important reasons why the United States is more likely to escape from this condition of stasis than Southern Europe or Japan.
First, partly because of immigration, partly because of fertility and partly because of inefficient health care, the United States is aging much less quickly than countries like Japan and Germany. By 2050, according to the United Nations, more than a third of Japanese will be 65 or over. For Germany the figure will be 31 percent. Even in China, more than a quarter of the population will be older than 64. But for the United States, the figure will be just 21 percent. China's labor force will start to shrink in the 2020s. That will not happen in the United States.
Secondly, unlike Europe and Japan, the United States is one of the global Big Five in terms of mineral wealth, with known reserves of fossil fuels and minerals worth at least $30 trillion -- more than Australia, Saudi Arabia and China, though less than Russia. In particular, the United States is poised to profit from an energy revolution that has seen shale gas leap from 1 percent of U.S. natural gas production in 2000 to 35 percent today. American natural gas is a quarter the price of East Asian and a third the price of German. The combination of an increasingly competitive labor market and cheap energy is going to spark a remarkable recovery of U.S. manufacturing in the near future.
Finally, as the world warms and climate becomes more volatile, North America will fare better than East Asia. Natural disasters will happen, of course, as Hurricane Sandy reminded us. But there will be more on the other side of the Pacific. Good luck to Asia's coastal megacities. They will need it.
Already things look better for the United States than for the rest of the West. The I.M.F. projects 2.3 percent growth next year, compared with 1.2 percent for Japan and 0.7 percent for the euro zone. That divergence will persist.
In America, the economic trends toward self-sufficiency and manufacturing recovery may encourage a new phenomenon: liberal isolationism, as the country reverts to its default aversion to ''foreign entanglements.'' By contrast, Europe and Japan will continue to languish, denying themselves the relief of higher immigration or nuclear power, stagnating under piles of debt that will become harder and harder to finance. In these stationary states, populism will take uglier forms. After more than half a century, European integration may turn into disintegration.
Meanwhile, in the mobile states of the developing (and still growing) world, there will be more bourgeois revolutions, in the classical sense of revolutions against autocracy led by aspirant middle classes. Already, according to Credit Suisse, more than 300 million Chinese adults have wealth of between $10,000 and $100,000, while close to 20 million have wealth above $100,000. These people are discovering that their hard-won private property needs to be protected by the rule of law, and that the biggest threat to that is a corrupt Communist Party, which they are increasingly able and willing to criticize in online microblogs.
In the big emerging democracies -- India, Brazil, Nigeria -- there is less need for a bourgeois revolution. Indeed, Dilma Rousseff, the Brazilian president, recently declared that she wants ''a middle-class Brazil.'' In North Africa and the Middle East, by contrast, the bourgeois revolutions have begun. It was in Libya last year that the following graffiti was seen: ''We want a constitutional role and for the president to have less authority and the four year presidential term should not be extended.'' That is the authentic voice of 1848, though it remains to be seen whether Arabia will truly turn at this turning point.
The American empire-in-all-but-name is leaving the Middle Eastern stage, having dominated the region since the 1970s and -- I would argue -- having sparked the revolution by toppling the most vicious of the Arab dictators. Now the real contest is between those who would impose a medieval legal order on Arabia, as the ayatollahs imposed it on Persia after 1979, and those who dream of the long-awaited Islamic Reformation, which would allow Muslims to coexist in peace with modernity -- not to mention with the state of Israel, modernity's representative in the region. The choice between the Iranian and the Turkish (or Indonesian or Malaysian) models should not be hard to make. Yet the Arabs may have to endure a period of sectarian warfare before that Reformation can occur.
The hardest question to answer, as the great tanker of history slowly turns, is whether the two dominant powers of the age, America and China, will be able to maintain what Henry Kissinger has called ''co-evolution,'' or whether they are doomed to re-enact the rise of the Anglo-German antagonism that culminated in world war nearly a century ago. Will it be Chimerica -- or what Noah Feldman has christened ''Cool War''?
Or blazing hot war? The approaching centenary of 1914 is a sobering reminder that, while elections may come and elections may go, it is wars that change history's direction most decisively. World War I did not sink the human ship, but it certainly sank the first age of globalization. Should a similar conflict occur in our time, we shall know that world history has reached a turning point. We must hope it will only turn -- and not keel right over.

HEADLINE: Let's Talk About X

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
In 1986, Democrats and Republicans came together and enacted a tax reform measure that closed loopholes and lowered tax rates. That was a great achievement. The '86 act has shaped thinking ever since. Now when people talk about tax reform, they instinctively say, ''Let's do another '86-style act.'' When they debate tax ideas, they inevitably fixate on the two levers that were central back then: closing loopholes and changing top marginal rates.
The problem is that it's not 1986 anymore. We have a different set of problems. The two levers highlighted in that earlier reform are not powerful enough to help us address the issues we face today. The 1986 paradigm has become an intellectual straightjacket, foreclosing considerations of the things we actually have to do. 
Unlike in 1986, the baby boomers are now in full retirement mode. The aging population means more government spending, even if we get entitlement programs moderately under control. It also means slower growth. The United States grew at about 3.2 percent a year for the five decades after World War II. It is projected to grow at only 2.2 percent over the next few decades.
We need a tax reform that will raise revenue and significantly boost growth. The 1986 model is poorly designed to do both those things.
Let's say we closed loopholes or capped itemized deductions at $50,000, as many of the current proposals would do. That would raise, at most, about $760 billion over 10 years. And it would produce much less than that if we started carving out exceptions for the charitable deduction, as we should. That revenue wouldn't be close to covering the trillions in new debt.
Let's say we raised the top tax rates back to where they were under President Bill Clinton. That wouldn't come close to raising sufficient revenue either. It might raise $82 billion a year, according to the Joint Tax Committee. That's small potatoes compared with what's needed.
Let's say we closed the loopholes and raised rates all at once. That might theoretically produce enough revenue, if you hit the middle class, but it would decimate growth.
Even the 1986 reform, which closed loopholes and lowered rates, didn't do much to increase growth. Even after the reform was passed, people were paying the same amount in taxes, so they faced the same basic incentives.
If you closed loopholes and raised rates, as we'd have to do this time around, then you would make the incentives worse. Raising top tax rates may not be as cataclysmic for the economy as some have argued, but this is still one of the most growth-killing ways to raise revenue.
In other words, if we're going to simultaneously address our two most pressing needs -- raising revenue and boosting growth -- we're going to have to break free from the 1986 paradigm.
That means asking the basic question: What is the single biggest problem with the tax code? It's not the complexity, bad as that is. The biggest problem is that it rewards consumption and punishes savings and investment.
You can't fundamentally address that problem within the 1986 paradigm. You can address it only through a consumption tax. This idea is off the table right now, but reality will inevitably drive us toward it. We have to have a consumption tax if we want to both grow the economy and reduce debt.
But isn't a consumption tax regressive since poor people spend a bigger share of their incomes than rich people? The late David F. Bradford of Princeton University effectively solved that problem with his so-called X Tax, which has recently been championed by Alan D. Viard of the American Enterprise Institute and others. Under the X Tax, you wouldn't pay the consumption tax at the cash register. Businesses would be taxed on their cash flow, taking an immediate deduction for investments rather than depreciating them over time. Households would pay tax at progressive rates on their wages but would not pay tax on income from savings.
The X Tax effectively taxes the money you spend right now and rewards savings and investment. The government could raise a chunk of revenue this way and significantly boost growth with little or no change in how tax burdens are distributed between rich and poor. Most economists vastly prefer consumption taxes to income taxes.
The other complaint is that a consumption tax is politically impossible to get passed. There are, indeed, political difficulties. But there would be huge political difficulties if we try to do another 1986-style act next year. Every special interest will fight every loophole closing. And after all that, the country would get very little benefit in return. The political barriers to an X Tax are no greater, and we would actually address our problems.
It's time to break out of the 1986 paradigm. It's time to explore consumption taxes. Let's think about X.

HEADLINE: China: Naval Patrols to Expel Ships in Disputed Sea

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS; Mia Li contributed research.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- China's growing appetite for rosewood dining sets, hardwood floors, plywood and printer paper is helping propel a booming trade in illegally harvested timber and spurring the destruction of fragile ecosystems across the globe, a British environmental organization said in a report released on Thursday.
The organization, the Environmental Investigation Agency, said the Chinese government has largely turned a blind eye as wood importers and furniture makers, some of them state-owned enterprises, have profited from a $4 billion industry that harvests wood illegally from Myanmar, Mozambique, Indonesia and other countries with weak law enforcement and widespread corruption. 
''Illegal logging and the trade in stolen timber are among the most destructive environmental crimes occurring today and directly threaten the world's vital forests,'' the report said.
Although some of the trees are used to make wood products that China exports, analysts say that at least two-thirds of the logs imported into China ultimately end up in the homes of affluent Chinese who are willing to pay steep prices for teak beds, merbau wood flooring and mahogany trim.
The steep increase in illicitly harvested timber mirrors a growing demand in China for ivory, shark fins and endangered wildlife that environmentalists say is depleting some of the world's most valuable resources. The group called on the Chinese government to follow the European Union, the United States and Australia, which in recent years have moved to ban the import of illegally harvested wood.
The report, which drew on studies from Interpol, the World Bank and the United Nations, said the unlawful cutting of tropical rain forest is a contributing factor in the growing violence among loggers, forestry workers and environmental activists in Africa and Asia. In the past year, at least 30 people in Southeast Asia have died in such skirmishes, the group said, including two Cambodian journalists killed for their coverage of the illegal timber trade.
''There is a war going on, and these logging gangs are armed to the teeth,'' said Faith Doherty, one of the agency's investigators. ''China can no longer stand on the sidelines while such crimes flourish.''
Asked about the report's findings, Hong Lei, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, said China was working to halt the importation of illicit wood. ''We resolutely oppose and crack down on the illegal felling of timber and relevant trading behavior,'' he said Thursday during a regular news briefing.
Last year China was the destination for roughly 30 percent of all the logs traded on the world market, making it the top importer of raw timber. The value of that wood was $9.3 billion, a nearly 30 percent increase over 2010, the report said.
The group estimated that at least 10 percent of China's timber imports were illegally harvested, an amount that would fill 200,000 shipping containers. It said state-owned enterprises were responsible for purchasing nearly half the tropical wood imported into the country.
The demand has been especially ruinous for the rosewood forests of Myanmar. Investigators said loggers have stripped bare a 62-mile stretch of mountains and jungle in Kachin State, which borders China.
Over all, Myanmar lost 18 percent of its forest cover between 1990 and 2005, with much of the wood trucked into China, despite a 2006 agreement between the two countries that bans such trade. ''Myanmar is China's supermarket, and Kachin State is their 7-Eleven,'' one local community elder told investigators.
The group said Chinese government officials in Yunnan Province, which borders Myanmar, were largely unconcerned with illegal imports as long as traders paid duties on the logs.
Beijing's apparent tolerance for illicit timber imports stands in marked contrast to its domestic restrictions, which environmental groups say have effectively halted the clear-cutting of Chinese forests in recent years. The government has been credited with an ambitious $31 billion tree planting program that, over four years ending in 2008, increased forest cover to more than 20 percent of the country.
So far, however, the State Forestry Administration has declined to move against illegal timber imports.
Liu Bing, the forest campaign manager in China for Greenpeace, said such inaction would ultimately penalize Chinese manufacturers, especially next year, when the European Union will put a ban into effect on imported products that use illegal timber.
''If China doesn't establish a law or a certifying system regulating timber imports, it's going to really hurt tens of thousands of small businesses,'' he said. ''Fighting illegal timber is China's responsibility as a global citizen.''

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Balks at White House Plan on Fiscal Crisis

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner presented the House speaker, John A. Boehner, a detailed proposal on Thursday to avert the year-end fiscal crisis with $1.6 trillion in tax increases over 10 years, $50 billion in immediate stimulus spending, home mortgage refinancing and a permanent end to Congressional control over statutory borrowing limits.
The proposal, loaded with Democratic priorities and short on detailed spending cuts, met strong Republican resistance. In exchange for locking in the $1.6 trillion in added revenues, President Obama embraced the goal of finding $400 billion in savings from Medicare and other social programs to be worked out next year, with no guarantees. 
He did propose some upfront cuts in programs like farm price supports, but did not specify an amount or any details. And senior Republican aides familiar with the offer said those initial spending cuts might be outweighed by spending increases, including at least $50 billion in infrastructure spending, mortgage relief, an extension of unemployment insurance and a deferral of automatic cuts to physician reimbursements under Medicare.
''The Democrats have yet to get serious about real spending cuts,'' Mr. Boehner said after the meeting. ''No substantive progress has been made in the talks between the White House and the House over the last two weeks.''
Amy Brundage, a White House spokeswoman, said: ''Right now, the only thing preventing us from reaching a deal that averts the fiscal cliff and avoids a tax hike on 98 percent of Americans is the refusal of Congressional Republicans to ask the very wealthiest individuals to pay higher tax rates. The president has already signed into law over $1 trillion in spending cuts and we remain willing to do tough things to compromise, and it's time for Republicans in Washington to join the chorus of other voices -- from the business community to middle-class Americans across the country -- who support a balanced approach that asks more from the wealthiest Americans.''
Beneath the outward shows of frustration and rancor, Democrats said a deal could still be reached before hundreds of billions of dollars in automatic tax increases and spending cuts go into effect, threatening the fragile economy. Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, pointed to conservative Republicans who have suggested that the House quickly pass Democratic legislation in the Senate extending the expiring tax cuts for income below $250,000.
''All you have to do is just listen to what's happening out there and you realize there is progress,'' he said.
But publicly, the leaders of neither side were giving an inch. And Republican aides said the details of the White House proposal pointed to a re-elected president who believes he can bully Congress.
''They took a step backward, moving away from consensus and significantly closer to the cliff,'' said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader.
The president's proposal does stick to the broad framework of the deal Mr. Boehner wants: an upfront deficit-reduction ''down payment'' that would serve to cancel the automatic tax increases and spending cuts while still signaling seriousness on the deficit, followed by a second stage in which Congress would work next year on overhauling the tax code and social programs to secure more deficit reduction.
But the details show how far the president is ready to push House Republicans. The upfront tax increases in the proposal go beyond what Senate Democrats were able to pass earlier this year. Tax rates would go up for higher-income earners, as in the Senate bill, but Mr. Obama wants their dividends to be taxed as ordinary income, something the Senate did not approve. He also wants the estate tax to be levied at 45 percent on inheritances over $3.5 million, a step several Democratic senators balked at. The Senate bill made no changes to the estate tax, which currently taxes inheritances over $5 million at 35 percent. On Jan. 1, the estate tax is scheduled to rise to 55 percent beginning with inheritances exceeding $1 million.
Administration negotiators also want the initial stage to include an extension of the payroll tax cut or an equivalent policy aimed at working-class families, an extension of a business tax credit for investments, and the extension of a number of other expiring business tax credits, like the one on research and development.
To ensure that there are no more crises like the debt ceiling impasse last year, Mr. Geithner proposed permanently ending Congressional purview over the federal borrowing limit, Republican aides said. He said that Congress could be allowed to pass a resolution blocking an increase in the debt limit, but that the president would be able to veto that resolution. Congress could block a higher borrowing limit only if two-thirds of lawmakers overrode the veto.
In total, Mr. Geithner presented the package as a $4 trillion reduction in future deficits, but that too was disputed. The figure includes cuts to domestic programs agreed to last year that the White House put at $1.2 trillion but that Republicans say is about $300 billion less. And it counts savings from ending the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, even though no one has proposed maintaining war spending over the next decade at the current rate.
''Listen, this is not a game,'' Mr. Boehner said. ''Jobs are on the line. The American economy is on the line. And this is a moment for adult leadership.''
Senate Democratic leaders left their meeting with Mr. Geithner ecstatic. If the Republicans want additional spending cuts in that down payment, the onus is on them to put them on the table, said Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader.

HEADLINE: Michigan Provost Named to Lead Dartmouth

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
Philip J. Hanlon, the provost of the University of Michigan, will be the next president of Dartmouth College, starting in July.
Dr. Hanlon, 57, a mathematician whose work focuses on probability and combinatorics, will take office on July 1, succeeding Jim Yong Kim, who resigned in April to become the president of the World Bank. The interim president, Carol L. Folt, will resume her role as provost when Dr. Hanlon arrives. 
''I'm thrilled to be the 18th president of Dartmouth,'' said Dr. Hanlon, who graduated from Dartmouth in 1977. ''I'm particularly excited to be leading Dartmouth in a period when I believe higher education is going to change in important ways.''
Information technology, he said, has already ''significantly changed everything about the way we live our lives,'' and he said he expected that it would be increasingly used to take ''moments of passive engagement'' -- like listening to lectures -- and ''flip'' them, so students spend that time on their own, and reserve class time for interacting with the professor and classmates.
''A second change is the nature of the workplace, which is becoming more diverse,'' he said, ''and a third thing that is changing is that the kind of issues the world is facing -- the future of health care, transforming K-12 education, balancing the federal budget -- are becoming more complicated.''
Dr. Hanlon, who earned a doctorate at the California Institute of Technology and spent two years in a postdoctoral program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, still teaches freshman calculus at Michigan. He said he would continue teaching at Dartmouth, an Ivy League college with about 4,100 undergraduates in Hanover, N.H. ''I'll have to reach out to the math department and see how I can be helpful,'' he said. ''I like to teach freshmen.''
As provost at Michigan, Dr. Hanlon has been a prime candidate for other college presidencies. ''I've certainly been asked to enter other searches, but this is the only one I was interested in,'' he said. ''It's important to me because of the impact the college has had on my own life, coming from a small town in the Adirondack Mountains.''
Indeed, Dr. Hanlon was introduced to his wife, Gail Gentes, by her brother, who had been in his fraternity at Dartmouth.
Dr. Hanlon, who will be the 10th Dartmouth graduate to become its president, said he expected to focus closely on the college's cost structure and finances. ''The historic funding model for higher ed is close to unsustainable,'' he said. ''We can't continue superinflationary tuition increases.''

HEADLINE: Fight Over Ferry on Lake Michigan Prompts Questions on Definition of Earmarks

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
To its critics, the S.S. Badger is a relic and a menace, a coal-fired car ferry that dumps tons of raw coal ash into Lake Michigan each year as it plies its four-hour route between Manitowoc, Wis., and Ludington, Mich.
To its friends in the halls of Congress, the Badger is a national historic treasure, a ship from a bygone era worth saving from the bureaucrats of the Environmental Protection Agency, even if it means skirting the line on the Republicans' sacred ban on Congressional earmarks. 
Buried in a Coast Guard reauthorization bill now in final negotiations between the House and the Senate is curious language saying a ''qualified vessel'' shall continue to operate for its entire lifetime, ''without regard to any expiration dates'' on the permit it operates on. Nowhere does the word ''Badger'' appear, and nowhere is the expiration date of Dec. 19, 2012, noted.
But the enumerated qualifications -- including that it be nominated for or on the list of National Historic Landmarks -- apply to only one vessel, the Badger, a 60-year-old ship with a look torn from an old postcard and a permit to operate, coal ash and all, that expires next month. Republicans supposedly put an end to special-interest language slipped into bills to benefit projects or employers in their districts when they took control of the House last year.
And the sponsors of that language, two Republican representatives, Tom Petri of Wisconsin and Bill Huizenga of Michigan, say it is not an earmark because it does not mandate the expenditure of any money.
''I don't see that as an earmark in any way, shape or form because there is no transfer of anything of value,'' Mr. Huizenga said.
Others disagree.
''If it walks like an earmark and talks like an earmark, it's an earmark,'' said Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, who has done battle with the Badger's owner. ''I'm not going to let that language go through.''
Steve Ellis, an earmark expert at the watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense, called the Badger's carve-out ''a tricky one.'' It is clearly directed at a particular project or entity, drafted by lawmakers to benefit interests in their district. It is clearly being done as a favor for a special interest, and it is clearly taking a matter out of the hands of professionals tasked to make such decisions, in this case the E.P.A.
But since no money is involved, it is not an earmark by his group's definition.
Still, Mr. Ellis said, Congress ''shouldn't be picking winners and losers in the regulatory arena.'' He continued, ''Things like this should be debated on their merits, in the open, not slipped in through underhanded means in a Coast Guard bill.''
Like so many issues in Congress, the Badger involves principle (in this case, an environmental record that opponents see as an affront), but also heavy doses of economics and personality. Mr. Durbin sees the dumping of 500 tons of raw coal ash annually as issue enough, but he is clearly incensed by the Badger's owner, Robert Manglitz, with whom he has jousted for years.
For those needing to traverse Lake Michigan and averse to a slog through Milwaukee, Greater Chicago and the industrial havens of North Indiana, the 410-foot Badger has provided a shortcut since 1953. Its owners glory in its antiquity, advertising it as not only the largest car ferry ever to ply Lake Michigan but the only coal-fired steamship left in the United States. Its owners seem to revel in its endangered status. Their Web site includes a petition to ''Save Our Ship'' that acknowledges the coal-ash dumping and a status report on its quest for a new E.P.A. compliance permit. The Web site promises the ship will be back for the 2013 season once the great lake thaws.
Terri Brown, a spokeswoman for the ship, said she could not comment on such issues while the E.P.A. was considering a new operating permit and Congress was considering the Badger's fate.
Mr. Durbin has pressed Mr. Manglitz to move the ship to diesel power, which fuels the ferry of its competitor, the Lake Express, out of Milwaukee. Mr. Manglitz has come back with what the senator called a ''harebrained scheme'' to convert to compressed natural gas, an ambitious promise that is off on the distant technological horizon.
Mr. Durbin's message to the people of Ludington and Manitowoc is: ''This owner of this vessel has had a more than reasonable time to show respect for that lake you live next to and refused. There comes a time when we have to apply the law.''
Economics also comes into play. To Mr. Petri and Mr. Huizenga, it boils down to one word, ''jobs,'' 200 of them directly dependent on the ferry, 500 more indirectly benefiting from it. Manitowoc benefits by $14 million annually, and Ludington, $21 million.
Niel Wright, a spokesman for Mr. Petri, said an activist E.P.A. that is hostile to coal could not be left to its devices without some backup plan in Congress.
''For Ludington, this has been a way of life for almost 60 years now, and it is a huge part of the economy,'' Mr. Huizenga said. ''It's important to us.''
Complicating those considerations is something else: competition. The war between the Lake Express (which links Milwaukee and Muskegon, Mich.) and the Badger is fierce. Badger allies accuse the Lake Express of opposing the language in the Coast Guard bill for one purpose, putting the Badger into dry dock.
Aaron Schultz, sales director of the Lake Express, said the Badger had been operating at a competitive advantage to his more modern ferry precisely because of prior Congressional favors. The Coast Guard language is an earmark by any definition, he said, because it is about money.
On the low end, it would cost the Badger $750,000 a year to retain the ash it now dumps into the lake. At the high end, it would cost $14 million to convert to diesel, a sum Mr. Petri tried and failed to secure in 2010 from President Obama's economic stimulus law. ''Frankly, I find his defense of his efforts as 'not an earmark' an ironic bit of parsing,'' Mr. Schultz said.

HEADLINE: Analysts Say Rosier View Of Growth Is Deceiving

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
Even though government figures showed on Thursday that the economy grew faster than first estimated in the third quarter, economists warned that the pace of expansion could slow drastically in the final months of the year amid the fiscal standoff in Washington and growing caution on the part of businesses.
The Commerce Department said Thursday that gross domestic product expanded at an annual rate of 2.7 percent in the three months ended Sept. 30, well above the 2 percent estimate it gave in late October. But the revision was driven by increased inventory accumulation and a jump in federal spending -- factors unlikely to be repeated in the current quarter, economists said. 
''It's a nice headline number,'' said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist at IHS Global Insight, ''but it exaggerates the underlying momentum in the economy. Sustainable improvements in growth are not driven by inventories.''
What's more, the revised figures show that spending by businesses on equipment and software declined by 2.7 percent in the third quarter, the first decrease since the end of the recession in mid-2009.
Mr. Gault attributed the weak spending by companies in large part to growing uncertainty among executives about whether Congress and the White House can reach a deal before Jan. 1 that prevents more than $600 billion in automatic tax increases and spending cuts from going into effect early next year. ''The No. 1 thing is the fiscal cliff,'' Mr. Gault said.
The impasse in Washington has not only dominated the political debate since the election, but also become a leading worry for corporate America. President Obama met with business leaders on Wednesday to seek their support in negotiating a compromise, the second time he has sat down with prominent corporate chiefs this month, while Wall Street has wavered with each zig and zag of the debate.
The president and Congressional Democrats favor letting Bush-era tax cuts expire for top earners, while many Republicans have opposed any rise in tax rates and are pressing for greater reductions in federal spending.
Most observers expect a short-term compromise to be found that blunts the full effect of the tax increases and spending reductions, but economists say the risks to future growth are mounting. If a deal is not reached, the economy will grow at an annual rate of just 1.1 percent in 2013, according to a new forecast issued Thursday by Macroeconomic Advisers, with unemployment rising to 8.5 percent by the end of the year.
Unemployment now stands at 7.9 percent, still far above the level before the financial crisis and the recession, and it is not expected to come down significantly unless economic growth accelerates. For now at least, that seems unlikely.
''Over all, it was a disappointing report,'' said Michelle Meyer, senior United States economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The accumulation of inventories went from subtracting 0.1 percentage points from the initial estimate to adding 0.8 percentage points, she said.
''A lot of that inventory build was unintentional, which suggests a downside risk for the fourth quarter,'' she said. ''Businesses had expected stronger sales and consumer spending and were caught off guard.'' Ms. Meyer said she expected the economy to grow by 1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2012.
The government also reported on Thursday that first-time unemployment claims dropped by 23,000, to 393,000, last week. But Ms. Meyer cautioned that these figures were much more volatile than usual because of the Thanksgiving holiday and Hurricane Sandy.
The weak underlying data in the report on third-quarter performance prompted Maury Harris, chief United States economist at UBS, to cut his projected estimate of fourth-quarter growth to 1 percent from 1.6 percent. ''Part of this is Sandy and part of this is the inventories,'' he said.
The uncertainty about what will happen in Washington is reflected in the sharp divergence of views among economists about growth in the first quarter of 2013. While Mr. Harris sees growth rebounding in early 2013, to an annual rate of 2.1 percent, Ms. Meyer estimates the rate of expansion will be less than half of that at 1 percent.
The Commerce Department data suggests that in spite of the caution about the future, the overall picture for companies remained healthy, with United States corporate profits reaching a record in the third quarter.
The increase from the second quarter was entirely a result of stronger business performance at home. Profits received from American-owned businesses abroad fell slightly in the third quarter, which may not be surprising given the recession in Europe and the slowdown in China.
There were signs of optimism in Thursday's data. Residential fixed investment rose 14.2 percent, a sign that the housing recovery was gaining steam. A separate report from the National Association of Realtors showed pending home sales rose to a two-and-a-half-year high.
Indeed, not all economists took a pessimistic view.
''Just because the private sector is going into neutral doesn't mean we have to automatically have a recession,'' said Michael Gapen, senior United States economist and asset allocation strategist at Barclays. ''Households are deleveraging, corporate balance sheets are strong, and business isn't overextended.
''Short of a policy mistake in Washington, it's tough to get a recession right now,'' he said.
The new estimate of growth represents a substantial increase in the level of the second quarter, when the economy grew at a rate of just 1.3 percent. It also marks the fastest rate of expansion since the fourth quarter of 2011, when the economy grew at a 4.1 percent annual pace.
This was the second of the government's three estimates of quarterly growth. The final figure is scheduled for Dec. 20.

HEADLINE: Tipping the Scales in Housing Court

BYLINE: By MATTHEW DESMOND. 
Matthew Desmond, an assistant professor of sociology and social studies at Harvard, is writing a book on eviction and urban poverty.

 BODY:
Cambridge, Mass.
IT'S easy to tell who's going to win in eviction court. On one side of the room sit the tenants: men in work uniforms, mothers with children in secondhand coats, confused and crowded together on hard benches. On the other side, often in a set-aside space, are not the landlords but their lawyers: dark suits doing crossword puzzles and joking with the bailiff as they casually wait for their cases to be called.
Millions of Americans face eviction every year. But legal aid to the poor, steadily starved since the Reagan years, has been decimated during the recession. The result? In many housing courts around the country, 90 percent of landlords are represented by attorneys and 90 percent of tenants are not. This imbalance of power is as unfair as the solution is clear. 
When tenants have lawyers, their chances of keeping their homes increase dramatically. Establishing publicly funded legal services for low-income families in housing court is a cost-effective social policy that would prevent homelessness and uphold our ideals of fundamental fairness.
Poor people cannot afford lawyers, and in nearly all civil cases they don't have a right to one. In the 1963 landmark case Gideon v. Wainwright, the Supreme Court unanimously established the right to counsel for indigent defendants in criminal cases on the grounds that a fair trial was virtually impossible without a lawyer. Eighteen years later, the court heard the case of Abby Gail Lassiter, a poor black woman from North Carolina who appeared without counsel at a civil trial that resulted in her parental rights being erased. This time, a divided Supreme Court ruled that the right to appointed counsel was reserved for indigent litigants only when the loss of physical liberty was at stake.
Incarceration is a misery, but the outcomes of civil cases, as Ms. Lassiter learned, can be devastating, with stubbornly resilient consequences. Consider eviction's fallout. Families forced from their homes often lose their possessions, too: furniture and clothes piled on the sidewalk or auctioned off by moving companies. Evicted families experience long stretches of homelessness, with kids bouncing between shelters or abandoned houses.
Sociological research affirms what anyone who teaches poor children knows: that residential instability is the enemy of school success. Evicted families end up in bad housing in bad neighborhoods because most landlords turn them away. Months and even years after being evicted, people experience more material hardship and higher levels of depression than peers who avoided eviction. Psychologists have identified eviction as a risk factor for suicide.
Our legal system extends the right to a state-appointed attorney to someone facing months or years of prison but not to someone facing months or years of homelessness. In recent years, the poor have watched their incomes flat-line or drop, while housing costs have soared and federal spending on low-income housing assistance has plummeted. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, only one in four families who qualify for housing assistance get it. The rest devote huge chunks of their income -- sometimes 80 or 90 percent -- to rent. For these families, missing a rent payment is less the result of irresponsibility than of inevitability.
I've spent the last several years studying eviction. I lived for more than a year in some of Milwaukee's poorest neighborhoods, shadowing evicted families and their landlords. Along the way, I saw hardworking landlords let some tenants slide when they missed payments or reluctantly evict families who had fallen behind. But I also saw landlords carry out retaliatory evictions against tenants who had reported housing problems, and watched some lie in court about what tenants had paid them. I met one landlord who hired heavies from outside the neighborhood to evict families and another who liked to remove the doors of tenants who hadn't paid up.
Providing lawyers to tenants facing eviction would help curb these abuses and prevent families from being wrongly evicted. And it works. A recent randomized experiment in Quincy, Mass., involving 129 participants showed that two-thirds of tenants offered full representation avoided eviction, compared with one-third who were offered limited assistance like instructional clinics.
Yes, some victories came from raising technical objections, but many others came in cases that were not open and shut but would have been treated that way had tenants been forced to represent themselves.
Are some tenants freeloaders? Sure. But what about when a tenant withholds rent because the toilet hasn't worked in three weeks? Or when a landlord serves you after noticing that you're pregnant? The determining factor in many eviction proceedings -- including those involving people who lose their jobs or fall ill -- isn't the merits of the case but whether tenants have someone on their side who understands the law.
The right to counsel in civil matters has been established around the world -- not just in France and Sweden but also in Azerbaijan, India, Zambia and many other countries we like to think of as less progressive than we are.
And the price tag -- a bundle, right? Not really. A program that ran from 2005 to 2008 in the South Bronx provided more than 1,300 families legal assistance and prevented eviction in 86 percent of cases. It cost around $450,000, but saved New York City more than $700,000 in estimated shelter costs.
The key point is that when we direct aid upstream in the form of a few hours of legal services we can lower costs downstream. We all pay when the state reacts to the many consequences of eviction by distributing public assistance, subsidizing health care or providing a lawyer to someone who hustled in the drug or sex trade to survive life on the street.
But this policy's worth should not be determined by the amount of money it saves. There are moral costs we incur as a society when our citizens are denied equal protection under the law and wrongfully thrown from their homes by court order. Countless families are living perilously close to eviction and homelessness. The least we can do is give them a fighting chance to stay put.

HEADLINE: Under One Roof, Building for Extended Families

BYLINE: By PENELOPE GREEN

 BODY:
Tom and Kristin Moser's new house -- nearly 3,000 square feet in a development outside Tucson -- has all the modern amenities, including solar panels and an open kitchen. But their house also has a feature that the builders are betting will be a hit, like the dog showers and craft rooms that beckoned during the boom. Tucked inside is a one-bedroom apartment with its own garage and a discrete entrance around the side.
The Mosers wanted the built-in apartment not to bring in a renter to help pay the mortgage, but rather as a home for Mr. Moser's 82-year-old widowed father.
''More than weekly visits and phone calls, he really needs to be around family,'' Mr. Moser, an investment manager, said of his father, Lee. ''It's the way he was raised. I think as a society it's a way we have to step back into.'' 
Built by Lennar, one of the country's largest homebuilders, it is the most extreme example of the sort of options, like 400-square-foot ''bonus'' rooms, that many of the big builders are now offering to accommodate the changing shape of the American family: boomer couples with boomerang children and aging parents, an increasingly multiethnic population with a tradition of housing three generations under one roof, and even singles who may need to double up with siblings or friends in this fraught economic climate.
Lennar started marketing its new designs last fall with particular gusto: ''Next Gen -- The Home Within a Home'' is a title and tag line intended to wrap the notion of multigenerational living in a futuristic gloss. But it is more than just marketing; the blueprints themselves are changing.
In fact, architectural historians, statisticians and builders themselves are pointing out that the new household -- and the house that can hold it -- is much like the old household, the one that was cast aside after World War II by the building boom that focused on small, tidy dwellings for mom, dad and their two children.
Population statistics help tell the tale. A Pew study reports that 41 percent of adults between 25 and 29 are now living, or have lived recently, with their parents. Over all, more than 50 million Americans are in multigenerational households, a 10 percent increase from 2007. It is a back-to-the-future moment.
''You have to go back to the 1940s to see those kinds of numbers,'' said Stephen Melman, director of economic services at the National Association of Home Builders. ''What the recession has done has really hit household formation hard, so instead of forming households we are having some contractions: the college student moving back in or someone's brother-in-law loses a job. It's an opportunity for the builders.''
Scott Thomas, national director of product development for PulteGroup, the largest homebuilder in the United States, said his company now offers layouts with larger ''flex rooms'' and an over-the-garage apartment it calls the Grand Retreat. Ryland and KB Homes have been offering similar alternatives, and have seen their popularity increase as multigenerational households become more common.
''For whatever reason,'' Mr. Thomas said, ''whether it's the return of something that was part of our lifestyle in the past, or simply related to the economy, multigenerational living is definitely taking place.'' Thirty percent of Pulte customers are asking for such features, the company said.
The developers are catering to people like Tina O'Donnell, 34, and her husband, Joe Rigby, 48, who bought a house in a Pulte development in San Diego last year. They moved in with his mother, Cheryl Rigby, 65, and three daughters. Mrs. Rigby retired early to help with the children; in return, her son and daughter-in-law paid for her health insurance until Medicare kicked in.
''She's very important to us,'' said Ms. O'Donnell, who works with her husband at a home-security company. ''And it was important that she felt like it was her home.''
The $680,000 model they bought came with four bedrooms upstairs, and ''flex space'' on the first floor, which they turned into a bedroom for Mrs. Rigby. It has a walk-in closet and its own bathroom, and it can be entered through the garage as well as the kitchen.
Wid Chapman, an architect and co-author of ''Unassisted Living: Ageless Homes for Later Life,'' said the 2010 census showed that the shift to the ''nonlinear family'' is part of an evolution that will be accelerated now that mainstream builders are responding to it.
''These so-called atypical households will be deliberately created and marketed in geographic locations that might have been the epicenter of the suburban classic nuclear family in the past,'' he said.
But how do you make a home that is flexible enough for those who have been used to separate nests?
The ''granny flat'' or ''mother-in-law apartment'' has been around for decades. But municipalities do not always love accessory dwelling units, or A.D.U.'s. Builders who have tried to market them have become entangled in delays by zoning boards in many communities that frown on anything other than single-family homes.
''We still have zoning that was put in place in the 1950s, when farmlands turned into suburbs overnight, with houses designed for mom, dad and 2.3 kids,'' said Michael Litchfield, the author of ''In-Laws, Outlaws, and Granny Flats: Your Guide to Turning One House into Two Homes.''
Mr. Litchfield warns of the ''dead hand of single-family zoning'' that inhibits the formation of households like those headed by a single mother, who needs to rent out space to make ends meet, or by boomers who want to build an accessory dwelling unit for an aging parent. Only California, he added, has a state law that allows homeowners to build such a unit ''by right,'' though some cities have altered their zoning codes to encourage their creation.
To circumvent zoning that is leery of duplexes, Lennar's Next Gen houses run on a single electric meter, have only microwave convection ovens in the apartment, and from the outside look like other houses.
''One address, one hookup, one electric meter,'' said Alan Jones, Lennar's Arizona division president. It was Mr. Jones who took a Las Vegas architect's concept and ran with it. In the last year, Lennar has developed more than 40 Next Gen plans in 100 communities in 10 states. In Arizona alone, over 100 have been sold so far. By next year, the company will be rolling out Next Gen houses in all their markets, Mr. Jones said.
''Once I've gotten to the right people, to the mayors and vice mayors of municipalities, they've been supportive,'' he said. ''We're in a situation where the world is changing. We need a home for the way people are living today.''
For their part, when Tom and Kristin Moser moved into their new house last week, they formed a thoroughly modern commune, joining Mr. Moser's sister, brother-in-law and his parents, who were already ensconced in a Next Gen house right next to theirs. Ms. Moser's mother is in a traditional house on the other side.
''I think it's a natural way to live,'' Mr. Moser said. ''Communal living fosters love, and commitment, and all the good values we want. Think of a rubber band being extended. That's the way most of us have been living. That is going to snap back when people say, 'This isn't working.' ''

HEADLINE: Trying Juveniles

BYLINE: By JOHN KAMM

 BODY:
BEIJING -- It's no secret that the Chinese government's human rights record falls short of international standards. Dissidents are imprisoned and harsh policies are imposed on Tibet and Xinjiang. Religious groups that operate without government approval are persecuted and a one-child-per-family policy is still pursued. Though the number of executions has dropped sharply, more than 3,000 people are still put to death every year.
Yet China has made important strides in at least one crucial area: the treatment of juvenile suspects and offenders. 
Police arrested about 80,000 juveniles -- those between the ages of 14 and 18 -- in 2010. That same year, 64 percent of juveniles whose cases were heard received custodial punishment. (The rate that juveniles are imprisoned after trial is around 27 percent in the United States and considerably lower in most European countries). In China, juveniles released from custody are often rejected by their families and face barriers to work, attend school and find spouses, in part because their records are unsealed.
This will change when legal revisions take effect next year. ''Conditional nonprosecution,'' a concept modeled after ''diversion'' practiced in the West, will be introduced to allow youth who commit minor offenses to avoid jail time by successfully completing six to 12 months' probation.
In an effort to promote rehabilitation, which is the principle focus of the Chinese juvenile system, the sealing of juvenile criminal records will also be applied nationwide for those who have been sentenced to less than five years' imprisonment. In theory, this should make it easier for youths to reintegrate into society.
Behavioral and psychological assessments are to be used at every stage of adjudication, and more protections for juvenile suspects are being introduced. Young women will no longer be interrogated unless a female officer is present.
The effect of these reforms, if implemented nationwide, would sharply lower the incarceration rates for Chinese juveniles. Thousands of Chinese youth could be spared time in juvenile detention centers and juvenile reformatories. At present, juveniles can also be sent to ''work study schools,'' and it is not clear how the reforms would affect these facilities.
Internal migration -- approximately 160 million workers from the interior provinces reside in coastal cities -- has led to a rise in the incidence of juvenile delinquency. In the decade between 1998 and 2007, the number of juveniles adjudicated in China jumped more than two-and-a-half times. In one district in Shanghai, children of migrant workers made up 95 percent of juveniles arrested during the three-year period 2008--2010. In the thriving special economic zone of Shenzhen, more than 75 percent of juveniles sentenced in recent years have been children of migrant workers from provinces outside Guangdong.
As in the United States during the great waves of immigration and internal migration in the late 19th century, children of migrants often don't speak the local language, and educational opportunities are limited. They are discriminated against in the workplace. Without educational and employment opportunities, some turn to petty crime.
After another double-digit increase in juvenile arrests in 2003, China's Supreme People's Court announced a plan to build a juvenile justice system. In 2007, the court began a pilot program to establish independent juvenile courts in 18 locations. Local jurisdictions were encouraged to experiment with ways of reducing delinquency and arrests, and some partnered with foreign nongovernmental organizations to establish community corrections programs and other innovations.
The government also stepped up cooperation with the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child, and the Supreme Court began sending study missions to learn ''best practices'' from foreign countries. Between 2008 and 2012, the nongovernmental organization I head, the San Francisco-based Dui Hua Foundation, undertook three exchanges with the court's Guiding Group on Juvenile Courts, hosting Chinese judges twice and sending American judges to China once.
These exchanges have had a major impact on reforms in China, but they have also revealed an American debt to Chinese reform. In October 2008, a Chinese delegation met with U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, a towering figure in American juvenile justice. Justice Kennedy was the deciding vote in the 2005 Roper vs. Simmons case that declared capital punishment for juveniles unconstitutional. China had effectively abolished capital punishment for juveniles in 1997, a move referenced by Justice Kennedy in the majority opinion he wrote.
At their meeting, Justice Kennedy and the Chinese judges discussed the severity of sentences in the American justice system compared to sentences passed down by courts in other countries. In 2010 and 2012, Justice Kennedy authored decisions that ruled that mandatory life imprisonment without parole for crimes committed before the age of 18 violates the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. The sentence of life without parole does not exist in China.
The experience of U.S.-China cooperation regarding the rights of juveniles suggests that it is possible to identify areas of common interest in the field of human rights and to work together to improve each other's human rights records. The two countries should spend more time acknowledging where progress has been made and making constructive suggestions on what improvements might come next.
In human rights, as in business, sometimes one needs to give a little to get a little.
John Kamm is the executive director of the Dui Hua Foundation.

Full reviews of recent jazz performances: nytimes.com/jazz.
&#x2605; Geri Allen's Timeline (Friday through Sunday) Ms. Allen, a wise and dynamic pianist, has been working for a while now with the group she calls Timeline, featuring a standard rhythm section and a tap dancer, Maurice Chestnut. The ensemble, with Kenny Davis on bass and Kassa Overall on drums, has deepened its rapport since recording an album, ''Live,'' in 2009, which was released the following year on the Motma label. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set on Saturday, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; $30, $25 on Sunday. (Nate Chinen)
&#x2605; Darcy James Argue and Secret Society (Friday and Saturday) A composer who understands the grainy particulars behind a sweeping gesture, Mr. Argue has been gaining steep momentum recently with the Secret Society, his flagship orchestra. This engagement seems likely to include some material from its forthcoming second album, ''Brooklyn Babylon'' (New Amsterdam), due out in the spring. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; $20 cover, $10 for members. (Chinen) 
Victor Bailey's V-Bop (Friday and Saturday) Mr. Bailey, an electric bassist of nimble touch and busy temperament, knows his way around bebop as well as funk. He sets out to prove it with a band that features the fellow fusion veteran Lenny White on drums, along with the saxophonist Alex Foster and the vibraphonist Monte Croft. At 8, 10 and 11:30 p.m., Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662, smokejazz.com; $35 cover. (Chinen)
&#x2605; Tim Berne (Tuesday and Thursday) This alto saxophonist and composer works in two contexts next week, each likely to showcase a different side of his tensile balance between abstract expressionism and intricate design. On Tuesday, performing the later set in the weekly Konceptions series, he leads a quartet with Baikida Carroll on trumpet, Ryan Ferreira on guitar and Ches Smith on drums. On Thursday, as part of the Sound It Out series, he works in a duo with the pianist Kris Davis. Tuesday at 10:30 p.m., Korzo, 667 Fifth Avenue, at 20th Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 285-9425, eurotripbrooklyn.com; $10 suggested donation, with a $7 minimum. Thursday at 8 p.m., Greenwich House Music School, 46 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 242-4770, greenwichhouse.org; $15, $12 for students. (Chinen)
&#x2605; Crystal Magnets (Friday) The name suggests a Brooklyn indie-rock band, but it's actually the handle of a dual-piano alliance between Andy Milne and Benot Delbecq, inquisitive improvisers with an interest in manipulating timbre. Closing out a three-night residency, they play an 8:30 p.m. set as a duo, and then a 9:45 p.m. set with an impressive guest horn section: Greg Osby on alto saxophone and clarinet, Michal Attias on baritone saxophone, Jacob Garchik on trumpet and Vincent Chancey on French horn. At Shapeshifter Lab, 18 Whitwell Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, shapeshifterlab.com; $15 for two sets. (Chinen)
Eliane Elias (Friday and Saturday) A Brazilian pianist with a transparent touch and a fondness for subtle harmonic shading, Ms. Elias recently released a lovely album, ''Swept Away'' (ECM), with the bassist Marc Johnson, her closest partner in music as in life. He joins her for this engagement, in an otherwise all-Brazilian lineup with Rubens de La Corte on guitar and Rafael Barata on drums. At 8:30 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; $30 side seating, $40 center seating, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)
40Twenty (Sunday and Thursday) This smartly rugged composing collective -- Jacob Garchik on trombone, Jacob Sacks on piano, David Ambrosio on bass, Vincent Sperrazza on drums -- just released its self-titled debut on the Yeah Yeah label, exploring an intersection of buoyant swing rhythm and complex harmonic coloration. The group plays an album-release engagement on Sunday; on Thursday it resurfaces with a special guest, the tenor saxophonist Ellery Eskelin. Sunday at 9 p.m., Shapeshifter Lab, 18 Whitwell Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, shapeshifterlab.com; $10. Thursday at 8:30 p.m., I Beam, 168 Seventh Street, Brooklyn, ibeambrooklyn.com; $10 suggested donation. (Chinen)
&#x2605; Egberto Gismonti, Danilo Prez, Gonzalo Rubalcaba, and Chucho Valds (Tuesday) Four elite pianists of South or Central American origins -- Mr. Gismonti hailing from Brazil, Mr. Prez from Panama, and Mr. Valds and Mr. Rubalcaba from Cuba -- gather here as part of Carnegie Hall's Voices From Latin America series. Their interaction, in various groupings, should suggest a collegial summit of prestidigitation. At 8 p.m., Isaac Stern Auditorium, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $15 to $75. (Chinen)
Henry Grimes Trio (Saturday) Mr. Grimes, a long-lost, load-bearing pillar of the 1960s avant-garde, plays bass and violin and reads poetry in this trio, featuring the academically inclined pianist Marc Medwin and the brilliantly dynamic young drummer Tyshawn Sorey. At 9 p.m., Somethin' Jazz Club, 212 East 52nd Street, third floor, Manhattan, (212) 371-7657, somethinjazz.com; $15 cover, reservations recommended. (Chinen)
Irabbagast Records Festival (Thursday and next Friday) The inexhaustibly creative young saxophonist Jon Irabagon has simultaneously released two albums on his new label, Irabbagast, which he celebrates with this two-night affair. On Thursday he leads two distinct trios: one featuring the bassist Mark Helias and the drummer Barry Altschul, distinguished veterans of the avant-garde (at 9 p.m.); and another featuring the guitarist Mick Barr and the drummer Mike Pride, a heavy-gauge pair who appear on one of Mr. Irabagon's new releases, ''I Don't Hear Nothin' but the Blues Volume 2: Appalachian Haze.'' At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Caf, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com; $10 cover per set, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)
&#x2605; Keith Jarrett, Gary Peacock, Jack DeJohnette (Saturday) The gold standard of jazz piano trios, this ensemble derives much of its identity from the extemporizations of Mr. Jarrett, who can sound dry and boppish one moment and fluidly romantic the next. But Mr. Peacock, an agile bassist, and Mr. DeJohnette, a deeply musical drummer, also play clearly defined roles; their names appear on that marquee for good reason. At 8 p.m., New Jersey Performing Arts Center, One Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722, njpac.org; $25 to $90. (Chinen)
Ryan Keberle and Catharsis (Thursday) A trombonist of eclectic sideman experience, Mr. Keberle has also been making his mark as a composer and bandleader. Catharsis is his groove-oriented band with Mike Rodriguez on trumpet, Jorge Roeder on bass and Eric Doob on drums. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; $15 cover, $10 for members in the first set; $10, $5 for members in the second set. (Chinen)
Lords of the Trumpet Play Dizzy Gillespie (Friday through Sunday) Boppish fluency and brassy urgency will be the distinguishing features of this weekend engagement, a salute to Dizzy Gillespie. The lordly trumpeters questing in his name are Randy Brecker, Jeremy Pelt and Brian Lynch; their rhythm section will consist of James Weidman on piano, Dwayne Burno on bass and Billy Drummond on drums. At 8 and 10 p.m., Iridium Jazz Club, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121, theiridium.com; $35. (Chinen)
&#x2605; Joe Lovano and Dave Douglas: Sound Prints (Friday through Sunday) The saxophonist Joe Lovano and the trumpeter Dave Douglas share a bustling and approachable vision of jazz, geared toward expedition while grounded in post-bop custom. Sound Prints is their working band, a quintet capable of hair-trigger movements, featuring the drummer Joey Baron -- a trusted colleague to both bandleaders, going back many years -- along with the pianist Lawrence Fields and the bassist Linda Oh, younger players of evident promise. At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; $25 cover, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)
Tony Malaby Tuba Trio (Wednesday) The tuba in question belongs to Dan Peck, the guts and in many ways the glue of this band. Tony Malaby brings his searching tenor saxophone, and his compositions; John Hollenbeck outlines texture as well as tempo on the drums. At 8 p.m., Barbs, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (347) 422-0248, barbesbrooklyn.com; $10 donation is suggested. (Chinen)
Donny McCaslin Group (Tuesday and Wednesday) ''Casting for Gravity'' (Greenleaf) is another compact but ambitious electro-acoustic venture -- part gritty, part gleaming -- by Donny McCaslin, a cool-headedly athletic tenor saxophonist and composer. The album features perhaps the best possible rhythm section for the task: Jason Lindner on piano and synthesizers, Tim Lefebvre on electric bass, and Mark Guiliana on drums, all of whom will be on hand here. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; $20 cover. (Chinen)
Ben Monder Trio (Friday) A painterly guitarist equally adept with color and line, Ben Monder does his earthiest work in this format, backed by bass and drums. That's earthy in relative terms; his rhythm section, with Joe Martin on bass and Jochen Rueckert on drums, doesn't ground him so much as keep pace. At 7:30, 9:30 and 11:30 p.m., Bar Next Door, 129 Macdougal Street, near West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 529-5945, lalanternacaffe.com; $12 cover, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)
Jesse Neuman's Wolf Face / Pete Robbins and Silent Z (Saturday) Impulsive tendencies meet with shadowy texture in both of these electronics-enabled bands. Wolf Face, led by Mr. Neuman, a trumpeter, plays at 8 p.m., drawing from a self-released debut album, ''The World Has Time to Bloom,'' with Loren Stillman on tenor saxophone, Simon Jermyn on guitar and electronics, Rob Jost on bass and Jeff Davis on drums. Silent Z, led by the alto saxophonist Pete Robbins, plays a 9:30 p.m. set featuring Mr. Neuman and Mr. Jermyn along with Mike Gamble on guitar and Tyshawn Sorey on drums. At 8 and 9:30 p.m., IBeam, 168 Seventh Street, Gowanus, Brooklyn, ibeambrooklyn.com; $10 donation is suggested. (Chinen)
NY3 (Saturday) Effervescent rhythm and unforced lyricism seem the most likely outcome from this newly minted collective, consisting of the clarinetist and tenor saxophonist Anat Cohen, the bassist Martin Wind and the drummer Matt Wilson. The trio is playing its second show, as part of the reliably rewarding Sound It Out series. At 8 p.m., Greenwich House Music School, 46 Barrow Street, (212) 242-4770, greenwichhouse.org; $25, $20 for students. (Chinen)
Ken Peplowski-Bucky Pizzarelli Quintet (Tuesday through Dec. 9) Ken Peplowski, a clarinetist and tenor saxophonist, and Bucky Pizzarelli, a guitarist, hail from different generations but share a brisk command of the swing and bebop traditions. Here they lead an estimable cohort of Derek Smith on piano, David Finck on bass and Chuck Redd on drums and vibraphone. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; $30 ($45 on Dec. 8), with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen)
Dave Phillips & Freedance / John Yao Quintet (Saturday) This double bill features two ensembles with recent albums on the Innova label, each attracted to an interactive small-group ideal. Mr. Phillips, a bassist, draws from ''Confluence,'' with the alto saxophonist John O'Gallagher, the guitarist Rez Abbasi and the drummer Tony Moreno (at 9:30 p.m.). And John Yao, a trombonist, regroups his partners from ''In the Now,'' including the saxophonist Jon Irabagon and the pianist Randy Ingram (at 8 p.m.). At Shapeshifter Lab, 18 Whitwell Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, shapeshifterlab.com; $10. (Chinen)
Pretty Monsters (Saturday) An aggressively texture-driven project of the bassoonist Katherine Young, Pretty Monsters otherwise features Owen Stewart-Robertson on guitar, Erica Dicker on violin and Mike Pride on drums. The group has a self-titled debut album out, on the Public Eyesore label. At 10 p.m., Douglass Street Music Collective, 295 Douglass Street, near Third Avenue, Gowanus, Brooklyn, 295douglass.org; $10 donation is suggested. (Chinen)
Reggie Quinerly (Wednesday) Mr. Quinerly, a drummer and composer of swinging disposition, recently released his debut album, ''Music Inspired by Freedman Town'' (Redefinition), a thoughtful but light-handed look at the social history of Houston's Fourth Ward, where he grew up. He leads a group with Jaleel Shaw on saxophone, Xavier Davis on piano and Vicente Archer on bass. At 8, 10 and 11:30 p.m., Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662, smokejazz.com; no cover. (Chinen)
David Sanborn (Wednesday through Dec. 9) An alto saxophonist synonymous with unctuous, gleaming crossover fare, Mr. Sanborn has been returning to his roots: the piquant soul-jazz of Hank Crawford and, by extension, Ray Charles. He returns to his regular New York perch with a band that includes Ricky Peterson on organ and piano, Nicky Moroch on guitar, Richard Patterson on bass and Gene Lake on drums. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; $45 and $55 cover at tables, $30 and $40 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)
Sara Serpa / Maria Neckam (Wednesday) Ms. Serpa, an astute and nimble young jazz vocalist, casts her gaze toward her homeland of Portugal in ''Crossing Oceans,'' the project she presents here at 10 p.m., with help from the trombonist Samuel Blaser, the tenor saxophonist Dan Blake, the guitarist Andr Matos and the bassist Linda Oh. In a preceding set, at 8:30 p.m., Ms. Neckam, an Austrian-born singer-songwriter, appears with an ensemble that includes Nir Felder on guitar and Joe Martin on bass. Cornelia Street Caf, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com; $10 cover for each set, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)
Mary Stallings and the Eric Reed Trio (Friday through Sunday) A jazz singer of soulful instinct and deep experience, Ms. Stallings has worked for more than a decade with the poised pianist Eric Reed, on many bandstands and several albums, most recently ''Dream'' (HighNote). Rounding out the rhythm section are Joshua Crumbly on bass and Kevin Kanner on drums. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; $30 to $35 cover, with a minimum of $10 at tables or $5 at the bar; $15 for students at select sets. (Chinen)
Loren Stillman and Friends (Friday) Loren Stillman, a smart young alto saxophonist with an inquisitive relationship to jazz conventions, leads a chamberesque group of like-minded souls: the pianist Russ Lossing, the bassist John Hbert and the drummer Eric McPherson. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Caf, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com; $10 cover, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)
Steve Swell & Omar Tamez / Douglas R. Ewart & Inventions (Thursday) This installment of the experimental Interpretations series will feature a tribute to the fairly obscure Mexican composer Nicandro Tamez, led jointly by his son, the guitarist Omar Tamez, and the trombonist Steve Swell. Also on the bill is Mr. Ewart, a multi-instrumentalist and multidimensionalist, presenting ''Water Is Tops,'' a piece of fluid focus, with the dancer-choreographer Ni'ja Whitson, the multi-instrumentalist J.D. Parran and others. At 8 p.m., Roulette, 509 Atlantic Avenue, near Third Avenue, Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, (917) 267-0363, roulette.org; $15, $10 for members and students. (Chinen)
&#x2605; Chucho Valds Quintet (Saturday) Chucho Valds has long been a pianist of imperial command, and at 71 he's also a supreme custodian of Cuban music, particularly the jazz-inflected species he has crossbred himself. Early this year he performed at Carnegie Hall for the first time since 1978, with Irakere, his trailblazing Latin jazz band. He returns as part of Carnegie's Voices From Latin America series, leading a group with Dreiser Durruthy Bombal on bat drum and vocals, Angel Gaston Joya Perellada on bass, Yaroldy Abreu Robles on percussion and Rodney Yllarza Barreto on drums. At 9 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; limited availability. (Chinen)
Cassandra Wilson (Friday through Sunday) Ms. Wilson takes obvious pleasure in a genre-blind repertory, as she once again demonstrates on her most recent album, ''Another Country'' (eOne). A showcase for her guitar playing and her songwriting -- not the safest move, for an artist whose most magical work has been jazz-based and interpretive -- it's full of tunes that skew distinctly Wilsonian in their slithery cadences and murmuring incantations. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; $55 cover at tables, $35 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)
Steve Wilson Trio (Tuesday through Dec. 9) The alto and soprano saxophonist Steve Wilson combines economy and modernity in his playing, usually in the context of a quartet (or on one of his blue-chip assignments as a sideman). This engagement intriguingly puts him at the helm of a drummerless trio with two of his closest musical partners, the pianist Renee Rosnes and the bassist Peter Washington. At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; $25 cover, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)
Phil Woods Quintet (Tuesday through Dec. 8) Some years ago the alto saxophonist and second-wave be-bopper Phil Woods released ''American Songbook II'' (Kind of Blue), a sharp and often sparkling album featuring compatriots like the trumpeter Brian Lynch, the bassist Steve Gilmore and the drummer Bill Goodwin. As has happened a few times since then, those players rejoin him along with the pianist Bill Mays. At 8:30 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; $30 and $40 cover, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)
&#x2605; Miguel Zenn and Laurent Coq: 'Rayuela' (Thursday through Dec. 9) Mr. Zenn, a soulful and searching Puerto Rican alto saxophonist and composer, recently teamed up with Mr. Coq, an articulate and painterly French pianist, on ''Rayuela'' (Sunnyside), an album directly inspired by the 1963 Julio Cortzar novel of the same name. They revisit those themes here, enlisting the same partners as on the album: the cellist and trombonist Dana Leong and the drummer and percussionist Dan Weiss. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set next Friday and Dec. 8, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; $25, $30 next Friday and Dec. 8. (Chinen)

GRAPHIC: PHOTO: EGBERTO GISMONTI, DANILO PREZ, GONZALO RUBAL CABA AND CHUCHO VALDS: (Tuesday) Four elite pianists of South American or Central American origins -- Mr. Gismonti hailing from Brazil, Mr. Prez from Panama, and Mr. Valds, above, and Mr. Rubalcaba from Cuba -- gather as part of Carnegie Hall's Voices From Latin America series. Their interaction, in various groupings, should suggest a collegial summit of prestidigitation. On Saturday night Mr. Valds, 71, will also lead an ensemble that includes Dreiser Durruthy Bombal on bat drum and vocals in a sold-out concert at Zankel Hall. At 8 p.m., Isaac Stern Auditorium, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org
 $15 to $75. (Nate Chinen) (PHOTOGRAPH BY MICHAEL NAGLE FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) (C19)

HEADLINE: A Long-Term Vision

BYLINE: By RANDALL SMITH

 BODY:
Vinod Khosla crowed about the clean energy industry last year. Three of the biofuel start-ups in his venture capital portfolio had just gone public, and the stocks had risen considerably after their debuts. "I challenge anybody to claim that clean tech done right is a disaster," Mr. Khosla said at a conference, rebuffing recent criticism. "We've generated more profits there than anybody has."
Since then, Mr. Khosla, the founder of Khosla Ventures, has watched much of those paper gains evaporate. As the clean energy industry broadly has taken a hit, shares of the biofuel companies - Amyris, Gevo and KiOR - have slumped 70 percent to 90 percent from their peaks. His stakes, once worth as much as $1.3 billion, are now valued at roughly $378 million.
The billionaire investor has been caught in the cyclical downdraft. 
The public stocks of solar, wind and biofuel companies are suffering amid industrywide pressures. The price of natural gas remains low. Europe has pulled back on incentives. American subsidies are in question after the bankruptcy of the solar panel maker Solyndra. And China is providing formidable low-cost competition.
"The whole clean tech sector has been out of favor," said Pavel Molchanov, an analyst at Raymond James & Associates, a brokerage firm. "I'd be hard pressed to name one trading above its I.P.O. price."
Despite the crosscurrents, Mr. Khosla seems unwavering in his commitment. He is pouring money into start-ups. Khosla Ventures recently invested more in LightSail Energy, a three-year-old start-up working to develop low-cost energy storage. He is also sticking with his public companies. His firm, for example, still owns 54 percent of KiOR.
"He's a visionary who likes to make big bets on ideas that can really change the world," said Andy Bechtolsheim, who co-founded Sun Microsystems with Mr. Khosla 30 years ago and shares a house with him at Big Sur on the California coast. "I would think he's made a larger personal bet on green tech than anybody else."
While the public markets are raising short-term doubts, the long-term investment thinking remains unchanged. Governments around the globe are pushing to find alternative sources of energy in an effort to reduce their dependence on fossil fuels that may hurt the environment. In a television interview in 2007, Mr. Khosla said "mainstream solutions" could replace up to 80 percent of oil-based power. Without them, he said, "this planet is history the way we know it today." After Hurricane Sandy, the subject of global warming - and changing climate conditions - has again come to the forefront.
In a recent blog post on the Forbes Web site, Mr. Khosla acknowledged the shift in market sentiment. "Clean tech went through a time when it was in vogue and now it is not," he wrote. "The financing environment for clean tech companies is tough today," he added. But he said he still expected "to do better than industry averages by keeping our losing companies to a minority."
Since founding his venture capital firm in 2004, Mr. Khosla has become one of the most vocal advocates for clean tech innovation, buying stakes in about 60 industry start-ups. Ausra, a solar thermal start-up that had drawn $130 million in venture backing, was sold in 2010 to the French nuclear plant builder Areva for about $250 million, according to one industry estimate. And SeaMicro, a low-power server maker, was bought this year by Advanced Micro Devices for $334 million, more than five times the amount invested by its venture backers, according to a SeaMicro co-founder, Andrew Feldman.
It's unclear how the broader clean tech portfolio has performed at Khosla Ventures. Mr. Khosla declined to disclose the firm's returns or to comment for the article.
But one of his funds, which raised $1 billion to invest in clean tech and other start-ups, shows gain of 30 percent since its inception in 2009, according to filings by the California Public Employees' Retirement System, the largest state pension fund. In his Forbes blog post, Mr. Khosla said a recent fund, which raised $1.05 billion in October 2011, was oversubscribed, and his firm's broader performance since 2006 had "well exceeded typical venture funds." In that period, venture funds over all have returned 7.25 percent annually after fees, according to industry data.
Mr. Khosla's commitment is an outgrowth of his three decades at the cutting edge of technology.
A native of India, Mr. Khosla, 57, earned a master's degree in biomedical engineering from Carnegie Mellon and an M.B.A. from Stanford in 1980. After starting the design automation company Daisy Systems in 1982, he co-founded Sun Microsystems, then a growing technology company.
At Sun, he supplied drive and vision. But Mr. Khosla, who is known for his blunt talk and intense manner, was replaced as chief executive two years later and left the company shortly thereafter.
In 1986, he joined the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. Over the next two decades, Mr. Khosla scored sizable returns betting on the growth of fiber optic networks. Two companies, Cerent and Siara Systems, were sold for a combined $15 billion-plus at the height of the late-1990s dot-com bubble.
Mr. Khosla was looking into alternative fuel technologies at Kleiner Perkins when a business plan for an ethanol start-up crossed his desk in 2003. The plan "sat on a corner of my desk for nearly 18 months while I read everything I could about petroleum and its alternatives," he wrote in an article for Wired magazine in 2006.
When he branched out on his own in 2004, Mr. Khosla invested millions in the ethanol start-up, Celunol. He soon established himself as a top venture capitalist in clean tech, attracting prominent outside investors like Microsoft's founder, Bill Gates. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain joined the firm as a senior adviser.
Over the years, Mr. Khosla has experienced his share of blowups.
In September 2011, Khosla-backed Range Fuels, a wood-chips-to-ethanol company, went bankrupt after receiving a $44 million grant from the Department of Energy and $33 million under a Department of Agriculture loan guarantee. When The Wall Street Journal editorial page criticized Range Fuels as an "exercise in corporate welfare," Mr. Khosla lashed back, saying the authors inhabited an "ivory tower" that was "full of people who don't understand technology."
Sometimes, Mr. Khosla's companies had to pivot from their original plans and focus on new markets. For example, Calera was founded in 2007 with plans to use power plant exhaust to make cement. Mr. Khosla called its technology "game changing" in 2008.
But the company encountered some setbacks. It postponed plans for commercial-scale production in 2010 pending further research and later cut its 145-employee work force by two-thirds. Since then, Calera has broadened its focus, developing other products like fillers for paper and plastics.
Like many venture capital investors, Mr. Khosla will risk a few strikeouts for the chance to hit home runs. "My willingness to fail is what gives me the ability to succeed," the investor has said frequently.
The odds can be especially brutal in clean technology. The projects are often capital-intensive - like $200 million or more for a biofuels plant - and they can take years to pay out, said Sam Shelton, a research engineer at Georgia Institute of Technology. By comparison, social media start-ups often require little upfront money and few employees. "The economics are totally different," Mr. Shelton said.
In part, Mr. Khosla aims to take stakes when the companies are still getting off the ground, rather than waiting until they're more mature and more expensive. He first bought a stake in KiOR, which aims to convert wood chips to gas and diesel fuel, in 2007. The company is now completing the first of five planned plants in Mississippi with the help of a $75 million interest-free loan from the state.
Mr. Khosla is "always thinking at a very high level about the potential of an idea," KiOR's chief executive, Fred Cannon, said. "He has a very good feel for when to step on the gas."
After jumping in early, Mr. Khosla appears willing to ride out the swings, in both directions. Over the years, public filings indicate he has plowed roughly $80 million into KiOR, amassing a 54 percent stake in the company. Although the stock is off its peak levels and I.P.O. investors are still underwater, his holdings are worth $356 million - a threefold gain.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: One Bad Turn Deserves Another

BYLINE: By A. O. SCOTT

 BODY:
A mobbed-up poker game has been robbed, and the guys who did it -- a twitchy ex-con (Scoot McNairy), his drug-addled Australian partner (Ben Mendelsohn) and the businessman (Vincent Curatola) who is the lame brains of the operation -- need to be dealt with. That rough justice, to be carried out by a melancholy hit man after a series of philosophical conversations with various associates, is the main concern of ''Killing Them Softly,'' a grisly little crime movie directed by Andrew Dominik and based on the novel ''Cogan's Trade,'' by George V. Higgins.
In spite of the golden presence of Brad Pitt as the killer, a level-headed professional named Jackie Cogan, the movie has an agreeably scuzzy, small-time feeling. Shot in and around New Orleans but set (as far as can be surmised from accents, geographical references and the source material) in a broken-down Boston, it savors the company of losers, fixers and would-be wiseguys. And they are all guys, with the exception of a briefly encountered prostitute identified in the end credits by profession rather than by name. 
Higgins, who died in 1999 and whose book ''The Friends of Eddie Coyle'' was adapted into a first-rate movie starring Robert Mitchum, was a master of hard-boiled, world-weary macho dialogue. Mr. Dominik, who wrote ''Killing Them Softly,'' carefully transfers the novelist's pungent idiom to the screen.
Mr. Pitt is cool and detached, retreating from his emotionally open recent performances into the studied charisma of ''The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford'' (also directed by Mr. Dominik, in 2007) and leaving the emoting to others. His chief foils are an anxious, middle-management gangster played by Richard Jenkins and a sodden fellow hit man incarnated with rancid swagger by James Gandolfini. Ray Liotta, who frequently shows up in movies like this one, shows up as the guy who oversees the ill-starred poker game.
It can be a pleasure to watch them all work, even in what turns out to be a disappointing job. Higgins was a genre magician. Mr. Dominik is a clever hand at genre pastiche, and the result is a movie, like ''The Assassination of Jesse James,'' that is sapped of vitality by its own self-conscious, curatorial fastidiousness. It takes place entirely in a universe of tropes and archetypes, which is a polite way of saying clichs and pretensions.
There is one desperate, misguided attempt to drag the story toward some kind of contemporary relevance. Even though the cars, the attitudes and the overall griminess of the production design evoke a bygone era, ''Killing Them Softly'' unfolds at a specific moment in the recent past, namely the autumn of 2008, when the American financial system spun into crisis in the climactic weeks of the presidential campaign. The voices of George W. Bush, Henry Paulson and Barack Obama float into the action from televisions and radios, occasionally inspiring comments from the characters.
It's a clumsy device, a feint toward significance that nothing else in the movie earns. Perhaps the bankers and speculators who ruined the economy are linked in some way to the punks and lowlifes who ruin themselves, and maybe Cogan is the allegorical double of Ben Bernanke. Anything is possible, since the movie is more concerned with conjuring an aura of meaningfulness than with actually meaning anything.
In the last scene Mr. Obama's victory speech provokes a cynical tirade from Cogan, who scoffs, in a carefully nonpartisan fashion, at the president-elect's idealism. ''America isn't a country; it's a business,'' this thoughtful killer declares, turning to one of his colleagues. ''Now give me my money.''
Fair enough. But it's still a free country, and you don't owe this movie anything.
''Killing Them Softly'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Bloodshed, swearing, drug use, smoking.

HEADLINE: Class Wars Of 2012

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
On Election Day, The Boston Globe reported, Logan International Airport in Boston was running short of parking spaces. Not for cars -- for private jets. Big donors were flooding into the city to attend Mitt Romney's victory party.
They were, it turned out, misinformed about political reality. But the disappointed plutocrats weren't wrong about who was on their side. This was very much an election pitting the interests of the very rich against those of the middle class and the poor. 
And the Obama campaign won largely by disregarding the warnings of squeamish ''centrists'' and embracing that reality, stressing the class-war aspect of the confrontation. This ensured not only that President Obama won by huge margins among lower-income voters, but that those voters turned out in large numbers, sealing his victory.
The important thing to understand now is that while the election is over, the class war isn't. The same people who bet big on Mr. Romney, and lost, are now trying to win by stealth -- in the name of fiscal responsibility -- the ground they failed to gain in an open election.
Before I get there, a word about the actual vote. Obviously, narrow economic self-interest doesn't explain everything about how individuals, or even broad demographic groups, cast their ballots. Asian-Americans are a relatively affluent group, yet they went for President Obama by 3 to 1. Whites in Mississippi, on the other hand, aren't especially well off, yet Mr. Obama received only 10 percent of their votes.
These anomalies, however, weren't enough to change the overall pattern. Meanwhile, Democrats seem to have neutralized the traditional G.O.P. advantage on social issues, so that the election really was a referendum on economic policy. And what voters said, clearly, was no to tax cuts for the rich, no to benefit cuts for the middle class and the poor. So what's a top-down class warrior to do?
The answer, as I have already suggested, is to rely on stealth -- to smuggle in plutocrat-friendly policies under the pretense that they're just sensible responses to the budget deficit.
Consider, as a prime example, the push to raise the retirement age, the age of eligibility for Medicare, or both. This is only reasonable, we're told -- after all, life expectancy has risen, so shouldn't we all retire later? In reality, however, it would be a hugely regressive policy change, imposing severe burdens on lower- and middle-income Americans while barely affecting the wealthy. Why? First of all, the increase in life expectancy is concentrated among the affluent; why should janitors have to retire later because lawyers are living longer? Second, both Social Security and Medicare are much more important, relative to income, to less-affluent Americans, so delaying their availability would be a far more severe hit to ordinary families than to the top 1 percent.
Or take a subtler example, the insistence that any revenue increases should come from limiting deductions rather than from higher tax rates. The key thing to realize here is that the math just doesn't work; there is, in fact, no way limits on deductions can raise as much revenue from the wealthy as you can get simply by letting the relevant parts of the Bush-era tax cuts expire. So any proposal to avoid a rate increase is, whatever its proponents may say, a proposal that we let the 1 percent off the hook and shift the burden, one way or another, to the middle class or the poor.
The point is that the class war is still on, this time with an added dose of deception. And this, in turn, means that you need to look very closely at any proposals coming from the usual suspects, even -- or rather especially -- if the proposal is being represented as a bipartisan, common-sense solution. In particular, whenever some deficit-scold group talks about ''shared sacrifice,'' you need to ask, sacrifice relative to what?
As regular readers may know, I'm not a fan of the Bowles-Simpson report on deficit reduction that laid out a poorly designed plan that for some reason has achieved near-sacred status among the Beltway elite. Still, at least you can say this for Bowles-Simpson: When it talked about shared sacrifice, it started from a ''baseline'' that already assumed the end of the high-end Bush tax cuts. At this point, however, just about all the deficit scolds seem to want us to count the expiration of those cuts -- which were sold on false pretenses, and were never affordable -- as some kind of big giveback by the rich. It isn't.
So keep your eyes open as the fiscal game of chicken continues. It's an uncomfortable but real truth that we are not all in this together; America's top-down class warriors lost big in the election, but now they're trying to use the pretense of concern about the deficit to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. Let's not let them pull it off.

HEADLINE: Chamber Competes to Be Heard in the Fiscal Debate

BYLINE: By ERIC LICHTBLAU

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- After months of sparring with President Obama in the heat of the campaign season, Chamber of Commerce executives came to the White House this week with a far more conciliatory tone, offering up suggestions to avert large budget cuts without having to raise taxes.
But Mr. Obama's top advisers were not budging. There would be no deal on the federal budget deficit, they told chamber executives, without higher taxes, participants said. If there were doubts about the White House's resolve, Mr. Obama met the chamber's chief executive afterward for an unscheduled Oval Office chat about the showdown. 
For the United States Chamber of Commerce, long the leading business voice in Washington, this month's negotiations over the nation's debt will be a key test of whether it can retain its influence and swagger in the capital even after a string of bruising political losses.
Many business leaders are looking to the chamber as a bulwark against the White House's push for higher taxes, but it is unclear if the century-old association has the clout it once did. Other business groups seen as more open to tax increases have become players in the negotiations, exposing rifts in the private sector.
The Chamber of Commerce, in the biggest voter mobilization effort in its history, spent tens of millions of dollars in support of pro-business candidates, usually Republicans, in the Nov. 6 elections. But the results were disastrous: out of 48 House and Senate candidates that it spent money to try to either elect or defeat, the outcome went the chamber's way only seven times, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington research group that tracks political spending.
If the chamber was an 800-pound gorilla before the elections, ''now they're a wounded 500-pound gorilla,'' said Cyrus Mehri, a Washington lawyer for U.S. Chamber Watch, a union-backed group that is critical of the chamber's political practices.
''But they're still a major force to be reckoned with,'' he added.
As the White House looks to work out a deal with Congress to avert hundreds of billions of dollars in automatic budget cuts at the end of the year, Mr. Obama and his top economic advisers have been meeting through the week with business leaders to push their plan for raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans.
Mr. Obama met Wednesday with chief executives from Goldman Sachs, Coca-Cola, Yahoo and other prominent firms, and he met a day earlier with small-business representatives.
The president's advisers also met with officials from the Campaign to Fix the Debt, a centrist group that has become influential in pushing for a combination of tax increases and spending cuts. It is led by Erskine B. Bowles, a former Clinton administration official, and Alan K. Simpson, a former Republican senator from Wyoming.
When Mr. Obama met two weeks ago with a dozen corporate leaders but did not invite the Chamber of Commerce, it was widely seen as a snub of the group over its political attacks during the presidential campaign. But the chamber got its turn Monday.
Jack Lew, the White House chief of staff, and other senior economic advisers listened as chamber executives, including Thomas J. Donohue, the group's president, and Bruce Josten, its top lobbyist, laid out their ideas for raising significant revenue without necessarily raising taxes by expanding energy development.
''They wrote it down, but where that goes, I don't know,'' Mr. Josten said in an interview.
But Mr. Josten said that the White House advisers stressed that any debt deal would have to include increased taxes at the highest brackets and that if an agreement could not be reached, they were willing to risk the automatic spending cuts -- the so-called fiscal cliff option -- at the end of the year.
''They reiterated that they want the higher rates, and they'll go over the cliff if they need to,'' Mr. Josten said.
After the meeting, White House officials led Mr. Donohue to the Oval Office for a brief session with Mr. Obama, which chamber officials described as ''positive and constructive.'' White House officials would not discuss the president's meeting with Mr. Donohue or the earlier meeting with chamber executives.
An Obama administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that ''the White House does not want to go over the fiscal cliff, but at the same time, we're not going to accept a bad deal.''
The chamber has already circulated letters in Congress, targeted crucial lawmakers, taken out ads and prepared position papers and Internet videos intended to discourage any debt deal that it believes would deter private investment and free enterprise through higher taxes.
While the chamber and its business members often proved the dominant voice on such issues in the past, the competing agendas of different business sectors have in some ways diluted the chamber's overall influence.
The Fix the Debt campaign, for example, adopted a much higher profile than the chamber in recent weeks with its own flurry of political ads, Washington meetings and news conferences to push its case for a balanced solution that would probably include tax increases.
''There are going to be a lot of distinct voices, and we're not simply going to throw in with any single coalition,'' said Matthew Shay, president of the National Retail Federation, a trade group that is pushing for a quick end to the debt negotiations.
At the same time, Mr. Shay said ''there's no daylight between any members of the business community'' on the overall need to reach an agreement without imposing hundreds of billions of dollars in automatic cuts.
''I expect the chamber will continue to play an enormously influential role in the debate,'' he said.
Chamber officials acknowledged that they were deeply disappointed by the poor showing of the Congressional candidates they backed, particularly in the Senate. But they scoffed at the notion, discussed in Washington political and media circles since the election, that the chamber's political influence was waning and that the group might become marginalized in the debt negotiations as a result.
''You really think we aren't going to have any influence?'' asked Mr. Josten, the group's lobbyist.
''If that's the case, why would the White House want to meet with us?'' he said. ''My suspicion is that they know we're going to have some influence on this. I don't think there's any member of Congress out there that doubts that.''

HEADLINE: Economic Reports Help Shares Gain Ground

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Stocks rose on Thursday after investors recovered from a pessimistic report on federal budget talks and were cheered by reports on economic growth and unemployment claims.
Stock rose and fell in tandem with the tenor of remarks from Washington. The Dow was up as much as 77 points in morning trading, but it turned negative when House Speaker John Boehner reported little progress in budget talks. Stocks recovered slowly in afternoon trading. 
The Dow Jones industrial average finished with a gain of 36.71 points, or 0.28 percent, at 13,021.82. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 6.02 points, or 0.43 percent, to 1,415.95. The Nasdaq composite index gained 20.25 points, or 0.68 percent, to 3,012.03.
After meeting with Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, Mr. Boehner told reporters that Democrats had yet to say which cuts to government benefit programs they would accept, suggesting that a final budget deal was not close. Republicans have said they are open to increasing taxes but only if that is met by significant cuts to spending.
Investors have been closely watching the talks between the White House and Congress over the spending cuts and tax increases that are scheduled to start on Jan. 1 unless a deal is reached to cut the budget deficit.
''It's a headline-watching market with this fiscal cliff,'' David Brown, the chief market strategist at the investment research firm Sabrient Systems, said, referring to the combined tax increases and spending cuts.
Mr. Brown said the continuing negotiations were likely to cause the stock market to take sudden turns in the weeks ahead. ''But things seem to be moving in the right direction,'' he said. ''I don't think either party wants to get pinned with hurting the market or the economy.''
Economists have forecast that tax increases and spending cuts will push the economy back into recession.
Stock in Guess, a clothing maker, gained 49 cents to close at $25.74 after it joined the ranks of companies pledging special dividends to shareholders before favorable tax rates on dividends expire at the end of the year.
Dividends, now taxed at 15 percent, will be treated like ordinary income next year unless Congress and the White House extend current tax breaks as part of a budget deal.
The Commerce Department raised its estimate for economic growth to an annual rate of 2.7 percent in the July-through-September period from the 2 percent rate estimated a month ago. The estimate was 1.3 percent rate in the three previous months.
The Labor Department also reported that the number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits for the first time fell to 393,000 last week, in line with economists' expectations. It was the second consecutive drop after Hurricane Sandy drove applications higher this month.
Target, Gap and other retail stores posted poor sales numbers, driving their stocks lower. Kohl's reported a decline in sales and fell 12 percent to lead decliners in the S.& P. 500. Kroger, the supermarket chain, rose $1.19 to $26.25 after reporting stronger quarterly profits and raising its earnings outlook for the year.
Interest rates were lower on Thursday. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 4/32, to 100 2/32, and the yield slipped to 1.61 percent from 1.63 percent late on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Most Face Lower Tax Burden Than in Reagan '80s

 BODY:
Most Americans paid less in taxes in 2010 than people with the same inflation-adjusted incomes paid in 1980, because of cuts in federal income taxes. At lower income levels, however, much of the savings was offset by increases in federal payroll taxes, state sales taxes and local property taxes. About half of households making less than $25,000 saved nothing at all. 

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: Tax rates have fallen for most Americans, especially high earners.
What's driven the changes? Federal income tax rates have declined ...
... while payroll taxes have risen for all -- but not as much for the affluent.
State and local taxes have risen, most of all for the lowest income groups.
And corporate taxes -- ultimately paid by people -- have declined.
Affluent households are earning more -- and paying a larger share of taxes.
But the distribution of the tax burden has become less progressive. (CHARTS BY MIKE BOSTOCK

HEADLINE: Complaints Aside, Most Face Lower Tax Burden Than in the Reagan '80s

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM and ROBERT GEBELOFF

 BODY:
BELLEVILLE, Ill. -- Alan Hicks divides long days between the insurance business he started in the late 1970s and the barbecue restaurant he opened with his sons three years ago. He earned more than $250,000 last year and said taxes took more than 40 percent. What's worse, in his view, is that others -- the wealthy, hiding in loopholes; the poor, living on government benefits -- are not paying their fair share.
''It feels like the harder we work, the more they take from us,'' said Mr. Hicks, 55, as he waited for a meat truck one recent afternoon. ''And it seems like there's an awful lot of people in the United States who don't pay any taxes.''
These are common sentiments in the eastern suburbs of St. Louis, a region of fading factory towns fringed by new subdivisions. Here, as across the country, people like Mr. Hicks are pained by the conviction that they are paying ever more to finance the expansion of government. 
But in fact, most Americans in 2010 paid far less in total taxes -- federal, state and local -- than they would have paid 30 years ago. According to an analysis by The New York Times, the combination of all income taxes, sales taxes and property taxes took a smaller share of their income than it took from households with the same inflation-adjusted income in 1980.
Households earning more than $200,000 benefited from the largest percentage declines in total taxation as a share of income. Middle-income households benefited, too. More than 85 percent of households with earnings above $25,000 paid less in total taxes than comparable households in 1980.
Lower-income households, however, saved little or nothing. Many pay no federal income taxes, but they do pay a range of other levies, like federal payroll taxes, state sales taxes and local property taxes. Only about half of taxpaying households with incomes below $25,000 paid less in 2010.
The uneven decline is a result of two trends. Congress cut federal taxation at every income level over the last 30 years. State and local taxes, meanwhile, increased for most Americans. Those taxes generally take a larger share of income from those who make less, so the increases offset more and more of the federal savings at lower levels of income.
In a half-dozen states, including Connecticut, Florida and New Jersey, the increases were large enough to offset the federal savings for most households, not just the poorer ones.
Now an era of tax cuts may be reaching its end. The federal government depends increasingly on borrowed money to pay its bills, and many state and local governments are similarly confronting the reality that they are spending more money than they collect. In Washington, debates about tax cuts have yielded to debates about who should pay more.
President Obama campaigned for re-election on a promise to take a larger share of taxable income above roughly $250,000 a year. The White House is now negotiating with Congressional Republicans, who instead want to raise some money by reducing tax deductions. Federal spending cuts also are at issue.
If a deal is not struck by year's end, a wide range of federal tax cuts passed since 2000 will expire and taxes will rise for roughly 90 percent of Americans, according to the independent Tax Policy Center. For lower-income households, taxation would spike well above 1980 levels. Upper-income households would lose some but not all of the benefits of tax cuts over the last three decades.
Public debate over taxes has typically focused on the federal income tax, but that now accounts for less than a third of the total tax revenues collected by federal, state and local governments. To analyze the total burden, The Times created a model, in consultation with experts, which estimated total tax bills for each taxpayer in each year from 1980, when the election of President Ronald Reagan opened an era of tax cutting, up to 2010, the most recent year for which relevant data is available.
The analysis shows that the overall burden of taxation declined as a share of income in the 1980s, rose to a new peak in the 1990s and fell again in the 2000s. Tax rates at most income levels were lower in 2010 than at any point during the 1980s.
Governments still collected the same share of total income in 2010 as in 1980 -- 31 cents from every dollar -- because people with higher incomes pay taxes at higher rates, and household incomes rose over the last three decades, particularly at the top.
There are now many more millionaires, in other words, paying more than they did in 1980, but they are paying less than they would have if tax laws had remained unchanged. And while they still pay a larger share of income in taxes than the rest of the population, the difference has narrowed significantly.
The trend can be seen by comparing three examples:
A household making $350,000 in 2010, roughly the cutoff for the top 1 percent, on average paid 42.1 percent of its income in taxes, compared with 49 percent for a household with the same inflation-adjusted income in 1980 -- a savings of about $24,100.
A household making $52,000 in 2010, roughly the median income, on average paid 27.7 percent of its income in taxes, compared with 30.5 percent in 1980, saving $1,500.
A household making $22,000 in 2010 -- roughly the federal poverty line for a family of four -- on average paid 19.4 percent in taxes, compared with 20.2 percent, saving $200.
Jared Bernstein, who served as chief economist to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., said the Times analysis highlighted the need to raise taxes on the affluent and cut taxes for the poor. He cautioned that the middle class most likely would need to pay more, too.
''When you look at these numbers, you understand why we're not collecting the revenue we need to support the spending we want,'' said Mr. Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research group. ''We've really gutted the system.''
But Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a prominent conservative economist, said the changes in taxation over the last three decades reflected a conscious and successful strategy to encourage economic growth that should be reinforced, not reversed.
Mr. Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office who is the president of the American Action Forum, said government should reduce deficits primarily through spending cuts, particularly to Medicare and Medicaid, the health programs that are the largest source of projected increases in the federal debt.
''We can't grow our way out of it, and we can't tax our way out of it,'' he said of the government's fiscal predicament. ''We have a spending problem, period.''
Mr. Hicks, like many residents of Belleville, views this debate with unhappiness. He would like the government to cut spending but not reduce services. He is certain that the government should not raise taxes on the middle class, a group in which he includes himself, but he is ambivalent about asking anyone to pay more. Higher taxes would hurt his businesses, he said, so raising taxes on those who make more money seems likely to hurt their businesses, too.
''At this point, I guess it's inevitable in order to get us out of this hole,'' Mr. Hicks said of higher taxes. ''Illinois is in bad shape, along with a lot of the nation. But I don't feel like we should tax the middle class any more than we are right now. There's going to come a point where they take the incentive out of working hard.''
If the government cut his taxes, Mr. Hicks said, he would use the money to put a roof over the picnic tables outside the restaurant, expanding the year-round seating area. He already employs 14 people; then he could hire more.
And if taxes rose? Would Mr. Hicks, who started working when tax rates were higher, really choose to slow down?
He smiled. ''No,'' he said. ''I like it. What else would I do with my time?''
Cutting From Both Ends
The federal income tax, which will turn 100 next year, is in decline.
Congressional Republicans and Democrats have repeatedly voted to reduce the share of income that people must pay. Over the last decade, annual revenues from federal taxation of individual and corporate income averaged just 9.2 percent of the nation's gross domestic product, the lowest level for any 10-year period since World War II.
The recession and new rounds of tax cuts further reduced revenues, to 7.6 percent of economic output in the 2009 and 2010 fiscal years. Stronger economic growth has produced a modest increase in tax collections, but the White House budget office estimates that collections for the fiscal year that ended in September will total 9 percent of economic output, still less than before the financial crisis.
Federal spending, meanwhile, grew faster than the economy over the last decade -- particularly during the recession. To pay those bills, the government borrowed more money than it collected in income taxes in each of the last three fiscal years, something it had not done in even a single year since World War II, federal data show.
Congress could have eliminated those deficits by cutting spending. It might also have averted those deficits by leaving the tax code unchanged. The government on average would have collected an additional $800 billion in each year from 2006 to 2010 if the 1980 code had remained in effect and economic activity had continued at the same pace, the Times analysis found. The annual federal deficits during those years averaged $714 billion.
Leaving the tax code as it was in 1980, however, would not have solved the nation's long-term fiscal problems. Increases in federal spending, driven primarily by the rising cost of health care, are projected to outstrip even the revenue-raising capacity of the 1980 tax code in the coming decades, necessitating some combination of spending cuts and tax increases.
The income tax stands apart from other forms of taxation. It is the reason that upper-income households pay a larger share of their income in taxes than the rest of the population. The combined burden of all other federal, state and local taxes takes roughly the same share from all taxpayers. And many Americans -- even in a middle-class, Democratic stronghold like Belleville -- have misgivings about imposing higher tax rates on the affluent, an important reason that income taxation has declined.
The share of Americans who said high-income households paid too little in taxes fell from 77 percent in 1992 to 62 percent in 2012, according to Gallup, even as income inequality rose to the highest levels since the Great Depression.
Some people in Belleville subscribe to the argument that higher tax rates impede economic growth by discouraging investment. For others, it is a matter of fairness.
Anita Thole, a middle-income safety supervisor for a utility contractor, is not wealthy. She does not expect that she ever will be. She is a single mother with a daughter in college, and she said she regarded the wealthy with a mixture of envy and admiration. But she does not want them to pay higher taxes.
''They work their butt off to get what they got,'' she said. ''I wouldn't want them to pay more so that I can pay less.''
Do they work harder than you?
''What? No. I work my butt off,'' Ms. Thole, 46, said. ''But you got to believe in the American dream. You got to love them for what they did, for what they made of themselves and for being more aggressive than me.''
Ms. Thole, like many in Belleville, is also convinced that governments could avoid raising taxes by adopting more frugal habits.
''There's some days we stay home and we eat peanut butter,'' she said.
What would she like governments to cut?
''I really like it when they cut the weeds along the highway,'' she said. ''I like it when there's good roads to drive on. The schools, I don't know, I don't want to pull back from the schools. I don't have the answer of where to pull back.
''I want the state parks to stay open. I want, I want, I want. I want Big Bird. I think it's beautiful. What don't I want? I don't know.''
To Tax or Not to Tax?
William L. Enyart is a rarity in Belleville: he wants to raise his own taxes.
Mr. Enyart and his wife are lawyers, although for the last five years he led the Illinois National Guard. The couple made $380,587 in 2011 and paid $104,864 in federal taxes. His conviction that they should have paid more may not be shared by many of the area's higher-income residents. But as the newly elected Democratic congressman for southwestern Illinois, Mr. Enyart, 63, is also the only man in town with a direct vote on federal tax policy.
Mr. Enyart, who won the seat of a retiring Democratic congressman, campaigned in part on his support for Mr. Obama's tax plan. He defeated a Republican candidate who opposed it, 52 percent to 43 percent. But Mr. Enyart said he heard little enthusiasm for tax increases in his district. What has changed, he said, is that people are increasingly concerned about cuts to government benefits and services.
''Nobody likes to pay taxes. Nobody wants to raise taxes on anybody,'' Mr. Enyart said. ''But nobody wants to cut veterans services, nobody wants to give up that Interstate highway, nobody wants -- pick the service that you like. These are necessary services, and they need to be paid for.''
The tax increase proposed by Mr. Obama, on taxable income -- income after deductions and other adjustments -- above $250,000 a year, would pay for only a small part of those services. It would reduce the projected deficit over the next decade by a little less than 10 percent, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
Nonetheless, Mr. Enyart said that he did not support broader tax increases. The focus, he said, should be on requiring the rich to pay more.
''We have the greatest disproportion of wealth since 1928, and I don't think that's a healthy thing,'' he said. ''How much money is enough? Do hedge fund traders really need to make a billion dollars a year and pay only 15 percent in taxes when we have teachers making $50,000 and paying 20 percent?''
John Siemens, who did not vote for Mr. Enyart, said that kind of ''raise taxes'' talk was a crowd-pleasing distraction from the need for painful spending cuts.
Mr. Siemens and his wife, Jan, both 59, own a company with a pair of factories in southwestern Illinois where workers assemble dollar-bill scanners for vending machines, dashboard lights for automobiles, magnetic probes for hospitals and other electronic equipment. They earned about $250,000 last year, so Mr. Obama's plan would not have increased their income taxes. But it would raise the estate taxes they would have to pay to pass the company to their children someday.
Like many opponents of the president's plan, Mr. Siemens thinks higher taxes will discourage investment and slow economic growth.
''There's some tax rates that probably do need to be raised,'' he said. ''There are some that need to be lowered. But the politicians are not having an honest discussion. Is it fair or not fair is not the question. The question is, If you want to raise revenues, does that make sense or not?''
He noted as an example that interest on municipal bonds is tax-exempt, which encourages the wealthy to lend to local governments.
''Those lower tax rates were put into place for a reason,'' he said. ''It's not just, let's give the wealthy a break.''
Mr. Siemens does have a concern about fairness. He believes that lower-income households are not paying enough in taxes.
''By any measure, the wealthy are still paying a disproportionate amount of their income in taxes,'' he said. ''Is that fair or not fair? I don't know, but I have an issue with the dramatic reduction of taxes at the low end because I think everybody needs some skin in the game.''
The debate is no longer theoretical here in Illinois. Facing perhaps the deepest budget crisis of any state, the Illinois legislature last year raised the state income tax rate to 5 percent from 3 percent. Unlike the federal income tax, Illinois taxes all income at the same rate.
Mr. Enyart said that the state needed more revenue, but that it should move to a tax system that imposed a heavier burden on high-income households. Mr. Siemens said the state should have cut spending.
The higher taxes have increased his costs and given an advantage to competitors in other states. And there are broader ripples, too: he said he was planning to buy some used machines, rather than new ones, to save money.
''We feel the burden of that, but it hasn't gotten to the threshold of pain yet where we would move,'' Mr. Siemens said. ''There's a lot of expense that would be incurred in moving, including a disruption of the work force, which you are always loath to do.''
View From the Lower End
Taylor McCallister, 20, works the front window at Mr. Hicks's barbecue restaurant, taking orders from customers. She also works a second job and attends Southwestern Illinois College. She earned about $30,000 last year and, like her boss, she wishes the government would take less of that money.
''When I see my check it's like, damn, that's a huge chunk that was taken out,'' she said. ''I could have been making $450 instead of $378.''
Mitt Romney's remarks about the ''47 percent'' focused public attention on the rising share of Americans who do not pay federal income taxes, a trend that has encouraged the public perception that lower-income households are getting a sweetheart deal. The share of Americans who think lower-income households pay too little in taxes increased to 24 percent in 2012 from 8 percent in 1992, according to Gallup.
But low-wage workers like Ms. McCallister still pay federal payroll taxes, which provide financing for Social Security and Medicare. They still pay sales taxes. Even if they are renters, they still bear the cost of property taxes in the form of higher rents.
And those taxes have climbed most quickly in recent decades.
The average American in 2010 paid 30 percent more of income in payroll taxes than in 1980, even while paying 27 percent less in federal income taxes. As a result, revenue from the payroll tax almost equaled income tax revenue before a temporary payroll tax cut took effect in 2011. The cut is scheduled to expire at the end of this year.
The rise of the payroll tax reflects the general movement away from requiring upper-income households to pay a larger share of income in taxes. All workers pay the same Social Security tax on wages below a threshold, which stood at $106,800 in 2010. The Medicare tax imposes a single rate on all wages, without a threshold.
Some experts argue, however, that payroll taxes are a special case because workers are entitled to Social Security benefits based in part on the amounts that they pay in taxes -- a system more akin to a pension plan than an income tax.
In Illinois, the average burden of state and local taxes rose to 10.2 percent of income in 2010 from 8.8 percent in 1980, even before the latest round of tax increases last year.
And Illinois, like most states, takes a larger share of income from those who make less. Illinois households earning less than $25,000 a year on average paid 14.3 percent of income in state and local taxes in 2010, while those earning more than $200,000 paid 9.4 percent, according to the Times analysis.
Ms. McCallister said she and her friends worry about the nation's financial problems. Their answer is simple: Someone has to pay more, and the affluent can best afford to do so. She said it was time to reverse a trend that had been going on so long it predated her birth by a decade.
''I want to know honestly how the more wealthy feel,'' she said between tending to customers. ''You'd think that they would want to help. We're working these kinds of jobs and that's what we have to do to make it through, and there's other people making all this money. I don't get it, honestly.
''I feel that maybe people who don't make as much shouldn't have to pay as much in. But who makes the rules?
''Not me.''

HEADLINE: About This Report

 BODY:
Economists and journalists have devoted great attention to federal taxes. This analysis offers a more complete picture of taxation in the United States -- the combined impact of federal, state and local taxes on American households.
There are no comprehensive statistics on the distribution of state and local taxes, so The New York Times used other government data to estimate the distribution of those taxes.
The Times developed the methodology and reached its conclusions in consultation with more than two dozen experts on taxation, including academics, specialists at government agencies like the Census Bureau, the Internal Revenue Service and the Bureau of Labor Statistics and researchers at organizations like the Tax Policy Center and the Tax Foundation. 
The Times created a nationally representative sample of taxpayers, and calculated a tax bill for each based on income, state of residence, marital status and other factors. The analysis was run for each year from 1980 to 2010.
Federal and state income tax bills, as well as federal payroll taxes, were determined using a publicly available calculator maintained by the National Bureau of Economic Research, an organization of academic economists.
The Times created models to calculate tax bills for three other kinds of taxes: property, sales and corporate income.
The analysis required choices, like picking a definition of income, about which tax researchers disagree. And as with all models, the results are estimates.
More details on the methodology and sources follow:
Income
The Times derived a representative sample of taxpayers from the annual March supplement of the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey. Various adjustments were required. For example, the survey was based on households that may contain more than one taxpayer, so The Times counted each of these taxpayers separately.
Another important adjustment involved high-income households. Because the census survey did not disclose income above a certain level (to protect the privacy of wealthy individuals), The Times estimated top incomes based on the research of Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez, economists known for their studies of wealth in the United States, and on published I.R.S. tables that show the overall distribution of income.
The Times also used I.R.S. tables for all taxpayers in the sample to allocate dividend income, interest income and capital gains income, and to allocate tax deductions.
The income estimates also include the value of payroll taxes that corporations pay for their employees, and the value of corporate taxes that are paid at the expense of employees, in the form of lower wages. These items are added to income to offset the matching tax payments, which we also attributed to the individuals, in accordance with standard economic theory.
Income Taxes
After building this database, which includes the calendar years 1980 through 2010, The Times ran the income data through a tax simulator maintained by the National Bureau of Economic Research, which is programmed with the details of the federal income tax code, and state codes, for each year since the 1970s. The simulator provided estimates of federal, state and payroll tax obligations for all taxpayers in the sample. The estimates of payroll tax payments were adjusted downward because some government employees do not pay federal payroll taxes.
Property Taxes
The Times estimated homeowner property tax bills based on data from the Labor Department's annual Consumer Expenditure Survey, adjusted to match the total amount of state-by-state property tax revenue.
Economists generally agree that renters also pay property taxes, in the form of higher rents. These amounts were calculated using data from the same survey, based on an estimate that taxes comprise 20 percent of rent.
The Times assumed that the remainder of property tax collections -- the total less the amounts paid by homeowners and renters -- were paid by businesses. These taxes were allocated among individuals by the same methodology as corporate income taxes, which is described below.
Sales Taxes
Individual sales tax bills were estimated based on formulas that the I.R.S. created for taxpayers who wish to deduct sales tax payments from their taxable income. The formulas include variables for income, state and household size.
The preliminary results once again were adjusted to match the total amounts that states collected, as reported by the Census Bureau.
This was necessary because the I.R.S. formula does not consider big-ticket purchases, like automobiles, nor the portion of sales taxes that are paid by businesses, which economists generally agree are passed on to individual taxpayers in the form of higher prices.
Corporate Taxes
Economists generally agree that corporate taxes are ultimately paid by owners, workers and customers, but they do not agree about the distribution. The Times used the methodology of the Congressional Budget Office, which estimates that owners bear 75 percent of the cost in the form of lower profits and workers bear 25 percent of the cost in the form of lost wages. The same methodology was used to distribute the portion of property taxes paid by businesses.
The analysis comes with several limitations that do not change the overall results, but are worth keeping in mind for anyone who pursues similar work:
The analysis includes the vast majority of government tax revenue, but it does not include some smaller taxes, including federal excise taxes and estate taxes, and certain state and local taxes. Excise taxes comprised 3 percent of federal revenue in 2010. Estate taxes comprised 1 percent. The analysis also did not include fees, which are a growing source of revenue for state and local governments.
Because of limitations in the source data, the model does not include specific estimates for the small number of Americans with unusually high incomes, but instead averages their income, and estimated tax burden, with the rest of the high-income population.
Also, the definition of income excludes the value of public and private health insurance, which some researchers prefer to include.
The model assumes that state residents pay all taxes collected by their home states, though in reality many taxes cross state boundaries. For example, the model allocates all New York sales taxes to New York residents and all New Jersey sales taxes to New Jersey residents, though some residents in these states actually pay taxes in both places. For information on tax payments across state boundaries, read The Tax Foundation's work in this area
The model assigns all taxpayers the full value of legitimate deductions and credits. It does not account for overpayment by people who fail to claim all available deductions, nor for underpayment by people who do not fully comply with their obligations.
While The Times used the I.R.S. formulas and data on tax collections to calculate individual sales tax bills, other researchers have tried to calculate sales tax burdens by using the Consumer Expenditure Survey to estimate the consumption level of households and businesses and then apply sales tax rate data.

Previews and Openings
'The Anarchist' (in previews; opens on Sunday) If she had never sung a note in her life, Patti LuPone would have a rock-solid stage rsum, thanks in no small part to her collaborations with David Mamet. Fifteen years after starring in Mr. Mamet's ''Old Neighborhood,'' she returns in this drama as a woman who has been imprisoned for 35 years. Playing her parole adviser is Debra Winger, making her belated Broadway debut. John Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, theanarchistbroadway.com. (Eric Grode) 
'Bare' (in previews; opens on Dec. 9) This rock musical about sexual confusion and Shakespeare in a coed Catholic boarding school has been kicking around since the Clinton administration. There was an Off Broadway run in 2004, and there have been more than 100 other productions worldwide. The subsequent success of ''Spring Awakening'' and other like-minded shows may have paved the way for this retooled version, which is directed by Stafford Arima (''Carrie'') and choreographed by Travis Wall of ''So You Think You Can Dance.'' New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, baremusicalnyc.com. (Grode)
'A Civil War Christmas' (in previews; opens on Tuesday) You won't see boys on crutches or hear ''bah, humbug'' in this Christmas-themed 19th-century play with music. Paula Vogel, a Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright, has set her sprawling new piece on Christmas Eve 1864 and filled it with soldiers, slaves, Mary Todd Lincoln and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. Ms. Vogel and her director, Tina Landau, have also found room for period songs and traditional Christmas carols. New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200, nytw.org, ticketcentral.com. (Grode)
'From the Ground Up' (opens on Friday) The 14-member Australian troupe Circus Oz is making its fifth appearance at the kid-friendly New Victory Theater, complete with jugglers, clowns and live rock music. And this time it has brought a distinctly New York aesthetic: The sets and costumes are based on the 1932 photograph of construction workers lunching on a skyscraper crossbeam. Don't be surprised if the onstage beam sees a bit more action this time around. New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, (646) 223-3010, newvictory.org. (Grode)
'Glengarry Glen Ross' (in previews; opens on Dec. 8) The schlubby real estate salesmen in David Mamet's masterful 1984 drama depend on a sucker being born at least every minute. With only seven years having elapsed since the last revival, let's hope new audience members are sprouting up at a comparable rate. Al Pacino, who was so memorable as the agency hotshot in the 1992 film version, graduates to the role of the old lion Shelley Levene. The newest young lion: Bobby Cannavale. Daniel Sullivan, who directed Mr. Pacino in ''The Merchant of Venice,'' takes on that task again. Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Grode)
'Golden Age' (in previews; opens on Tuesday) Terrence McNally has had success both writing about opera (''The Lisbon Traviata,'' ''Master Class'') and writing opera himself (''Dead Man Walking''). He revisits this theme with his latest play, which is set on the opening night of Vincenzo Bellini's new opera ''I Puritani'' in 1835. Lee Pace stars as Bellini and is joined by an array of stage regulars: Bebe Neuwirth, Lorenzo Pisoni, Will Rogers and Richard Easton. City Center, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212, manhattantheatreclub.com. (Grode)
'Golden Boy' (in previews; opens on Thursday) The last time the director Bartlett Sher dipped into the Clifford Odets canon for Lincoln Center Theater, the result was the soul-stirring 2006 revival of ''Awake and Sing!'' With this 75th-anniversary production of the Odets classic about a talented violinist forced to choose between music and a more lucrative career in prizefighting, Mr. Sher returns to the same stage as that earlier Tony-winning success, and also to the same theater where this play had its 1937 premiere. Alongside Seth Numrich (''War Horse'') in the title role, the large ensemble cast includes Danny Burstein, Ned Eisenberg, Jonathan Hadary, Tony Shalhoub and Yvonne Strahovski. Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (David Rooney)
'The Great God Pan' (in previews; opens on Dec. 18) A young Brooklyn writer seems to have it all -- until the possibility of a dark childhood secret threatens to upend everything. It sounds like fairly well-traveled ground, but the fast-rising playwright Amy Herzog (''After the Revolution,'' ''4000 Miles''), along with a cast that includes Becky Ann Baker and Peter Friedman, should carve out some new vistas along the way. Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Grode)
'Hearts Like Fists' (previews start on Friday; opens on Saturday) Flux Theater Ensemble presents this ''superhero noir comedy'' by the prolific Adam Szymkowicz about a team of buxom crime fighters and a supervillain who targets lovers. Let's hope Mr. Szymkowicz has an unlimited MetroCard: Terranova Collective is producing his adaptation of ''Ubu Roi'' in the West Village more or less simultaneously. Secret Theater, 44-02 23rd Street, Long Island City, Queens, (866) 811-4111, fluxtheatre.org. (Grode)
'Ingenious Nature' (in previews; opens on Wednesday) Having already given a hip-hop-inflected primer on all things Darwinian in ''The Rap Guide to Evolution,'' Baba Brinkman returns to the subject matter from a more utilitarian point of view. In short, do alpha males really get all the girls? As the sort of guy who likes to turn evolution and ''The Canterbury Tales'' into rap-theater hybrids, Mr. Brinkman may have a vested interest in this question. SoHo Playhouse, 15 Van Dam Street, South Village, (866) 811-4111, sohoplayhouse.com. (Grode)
'It's a Wonderful Life' (previews start on Wednesday; opens on Dec. 10) If you think adapting a beloved film for the stage is tricky, try the radio. Here Irish Rep essentially tries both at once, retelling the 1946 Frank Capra classic in the context of a radio drama, complete with onstage sound effects. A cast of six will give voice to George Bailey, Clarence Odbody, the villainous Henry Potter and almost two dozen other characters. Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737, irishrep.org. (Grode)
'The Last Seder' (previews start on Saturday; opens on Tuesday) Four sisters return to their childhood home for a final Passover celebration there, paving the way for all sorts of memories, resentments, deceptions and reconciliations. Jennifer Maisel's new play includes among its cast the former child star Gaby Hoffmann (''Sleepless in Seattle'') and the ''Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman'' veteran Greg Mullavey. Theater Three, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444, rosalindproductions.com. (Grode)
'P.S. Jones and the Frozen City' (previews start on Monday; opens on Dec. 10) Robert Askins's filthy sock-puppet comedy ''Hand to God'' was a surprise hit last year, and his follow-up play sounds similarly odd. P.S. Jones is the protagonist in this comic-book-style adventure story, and the utopian Frozen City is where his dimwitted brother is about to be deified. Soon the fate of three worlds rests in his hands, as fates tend to do in superhero quest narratives. New Ohio Theater, 154 Christopher Street, West Village, (800) 838-3006, terranovacollective.org. (Grode)
'Restoration Comedy' (previews begin on Monday; opens on Dec. 10) Last winter Ed Sylvanus Iskandar generated headlines at the Flea for directing all seven of Sophocles's extant plays in ''These Seven Sicknesses.'' Now Mr. Iskandar and the Bats, the Flea's always-game acting company, move forward two millenniums to take on Amy Freed's mash-up of two competing Restoration comedies, ''Love's Last Shift'' (apparently a big hit in 1696) and ''The Relapse.'' As with ''Sicknesses,'' the period-specific entertainment extends well beyond the playing time; expect burlesque at intermission, a Baroque musicale beforehand and cocktails more or less whenever. Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101, theflea.org. (Grode)
'Thirteen Things About Ed Carpolotti' (previews start on Tuesday; opens on Dec. 11) Jeffrey Hatcher's ''Three Viewings'' clearly has a fan in Barry Kleinbort, who has taken one of that play's three extended monologues and turned it into a full-fledged musical. Penny Fuller reprises her ''Three Viewings'' role of a newly widowed woman who learns plenty about her dead husband, little of it good. In addition to writing the book, music and lyrics, the industrious Mr. Kleinbort also directs. 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-4200, 59e59.org. (Grode)
'Volpone' (in previews; opens on Sunday) Red Bull Theater doesn't mount that many full productions, but when it does, they tend to be memorably visceral takes on the classics. But it gravitates toward the grislier pockets of the canon, which makes this revival of Ben Jonson's 1606 comedy all the more surprising. Count on the likes of Stephen Spinella, Tovah Feldshuh and Alvin Epstein to provide the Jacobean giggles. Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 352-3101, redbulltheater.com. (Grode)
'What Rhymes With America' (in previews; opens on Dec. 12) Through a series of beguilingly off-kilter plays with short titles (''This,'' ''Suitcase,'' ''[sic]''), Melissa James Gibson has emerged over the last decade as one of Off Broadway's freshest voices. She teams up once again with the director Daniel Aukin for this latest piece, about a father and daughter separated by a closed door. The four-member cast includes the recent Tony Award nominee Da'Vine Joy Randolph (''Ghost''). Linda Gross Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 279-4200, atlantictheater.org. (Grode)
'Working' (previews start on Saturday; opens on Dec. 12) This musical version of Studs Terkel's much-admired oral history of ordinary Americans has always been a collective effort; the 1978 Broadway premiere featured music and lyrics by everyone from Stephen Schwartz and Micki Grant to James Taylor. Since then it has added a pair of songs by the ''In the Heights'' Tony-winner Lin-Manuel Miranda, and that version is making its New York debut. Six actors, among them Donna Lynne Champlin and Jay Armstrong Johnson, perform no fewer than 36 characters. 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-4200, 59e59.org. (Grode)
Broadway
'Annie' James Lapine's revival of the singing comic strip from 1977 is merely serviceable. But its smiley-faced mixture of hope and corn scratches an itch in a city recovering from a recession and a hurricane. Theatergoers may feel the urge both to mist up and throw up, but Lilla Crawford is a nigh irresistible Orphan Annie. With Katie Finneran and Anthony Warlow (2:25). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Ben Brantley)
'Bring It On: The Musical' An A-list of musical-theater artists -- Tom Kitt (''Next to Normal''), Lin-Manuel Miranda (''In the Heights''), Jeff Whitty (''Avenue Q'') and Amanda Green -- teamed to create this featherweight concoction inspired by the cult-fave movie about rival cheerleaders. The human pyrotechnics in the cheerleading sequences are the highlight (2:15). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Charles Isherwood)
'Chaplin: The Musical' Though Rob McClure does a graceful impersonation of the title character of this soppy bio-musical, the off-screen Charlie Chaplin is often missing in action, devoured by a swarm of man-eating clichs. This gray-toned sour-smell-of-success story, featuring vaporous songs by Christopher Curtis and directed by Warren Carlyle, takes those clichs very seriously (2:30). Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'A Christmas Story, The Musical' An amiable, blessedly ungarish holiday musical for family audiences, faithfully adapted from the popular 1983 movie drawing on the writings of Jean Shepherd (2:20). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com, achristmasstorythemusical.com. (Isherwood)
'Elf' This stage musical based on the Will Ferrell movie returns to Broadway with Wayne Knight as the celebrity Santa, though he isn't around much. The production, like all the holiday-themed shows clogging New York theaters, has some funny moments, a couple of decent musical numbers and a lot of generic-feeling songs and synthetic sentiment. Jordan Gelber in the role of Buddy, the human raised as an elf who comes to New York to find his real father, never really finds a comfort zone for the sometimes awkward, sometimes perceptive character (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, elfmusical.com. (Neil Genzlinger)
'Evita' This just in: Eva Pern is still dead. That, anyway, is on the evidence of Michael Grandage's unsmiling revival of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice's 1978 bio-musical, which feels about as warm-blooded as a gilded mummy. Elena Roger, Michael Cerveris and Ricky Martin are the stars of this earnest combination of requiem mass and history pageant (2:30). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, Manhattan, (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)
'Grace' Craig Wright's cool, strangulated essay of a play about forms of faith isn't as intellectually unsettling as it means to be. But the cast (which includes Paul Rudd, Ed Asner and Kate Arrington) is very good under Dexter Bullard's direction. And Michael Shannon confirms his status as our most convincing interpreter of uneasy American manhood (1:40). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'The Heiress' Masterpiece Theater on Broadway. Moiss Kaufman's revival of Ruth and Augustus Goetz's sturdy war horse, starring a one-note Jessica Chastain, is lovely to look at, easy to follow -- and aside from a vivid supporting performance from Judith Ivey -- about as full of real life as an Olde New York Christmas window in a department store (2:45). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'The Mystery of Edwin Drood' A boisterous, well-cast revival of Rupert Holmes's Tony-winning 1986 musical, which gives the audience the chance to choose the identity of the killer of the titular hero. Chita Rivera lends an air of authentic glamour, Jim Norton is a cutup as the music-hall proprietor, and the young cast sings the lovely score with great skill (2:35). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Isherwood)
'Newsies' This Disney musical -- adapted from the 1992 movie and inspired by the newsboy strike of 1899 -- markets Urchin Appeal with extra! extra! enthusiasm. Jeff Calhoun directs a cast of comely, if overgrown, ragamuffins. The largely interchangeable songs are by Alan Menken and Jack Feldman (2:20). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (866) 870-2717, newsiesthemusical.com. (Brantley)
'Nice Work if You Can Get It' Every now and then a bubble of pure, tickling charm rises from the artificial froth of this pastiche 1920s musical, directed by Kathleen Marshall and featuring songs by George and Ira Gershwin. But mostly the production, starring Matthew Broderick and Kelli O'Hara, registers as a shiny, dutiful trickle of gags and production numbers (2:30). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Once' This gentle musical, set in Dublin, about a love affair that never quite happens -- based on the 2006 movie -- inventively uses songs (by Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova) and dance to convey a beautiful shimmer of might-have-been regret. Staged by John Tiffany and Steven Hoggett (''Black Watch''), the production stars the immensely appealing Steve Kazee and Cristin Milioti (2:15). Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Peter and the Starcatcher' The most exhilarating and inventive example of story theater since the Royal Shakespeare Company's ''Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby.'' This production, about the boy who became Peter Pan, is an enchanted anatomy of the urge to defy gravity. Roger Rees and Alex Timbers direct (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)
'Scandalous: The Life and Trials of Aimee Semple McPherson' Kathie Lee Gifford (yes, her!) wrote the book and lyrics for this dull musical about the life of the pioneering evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson. Carolee Carmello is in vibrant voice as the holy roller, but the storytelling is formulaic and the songs merely serviceable (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (877) 250-2929, scandalousonbroadway.com. (Isherwood)
&#x2605; 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?' Pam MacKinnon's shattering 50th-anniversary revival of Edward Albee's hair-raising drama of marital discord stars an electrifying Tracy Letts (of ''August: Osage County'' fame) as George and Amy Morton (ditto) as Martha, ably supported by Carrie Coon and Madison Dirks as the young couple they use as cannon fodder. Not to be missed (3:05). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
Off Broadway
'Bad Jews' The wonderful Tracee Chimo (''Circle Mirror Tranformation,'' ''Bachelorette'') gives a sensational performance in Joshua Harmon's play, portraying a smart, funny and seriously abrasive young woman who is embroiled in a dispute with her cousin over who is entitled to a family heirloom (1:40). Black Box Theater at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (212) 719-1300, roundaboutunderground.org. (Isherwood)
'Cougar the Musical' Three older women find themselves attracted to younger men, two against their better judgment. The concept seems made for bus tours, but imagination, appealing numbers with original melodies and theme-transcending jokes lift this show well above the level of ''Menopause: The Musical'' and its ilk (1:30). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Anita Gates)
&#x2605; 'Disgraced' A stimulating, eloquent and bitingly funny new play by Ayad Akhtar about a corporate lawyer of Muslim origins (the excellent Aasif Mandvi of ''The Daily Show''), whose well-heeled life begins to unravel when he becomes involved in a court case involving an unjustly jailed imam (1:20). Claire Tow Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com, lct3.org. (Isherwood)
'Emotional Creature' This collage of songs, monologues and spoken-word pieces by Eve Ensler explore the problems facing young women around the globe, from sex-slavery to the plague of mean girls. Performed with vivifying passion by a talented young cast of six (1:30). Pershing Square Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Isherwood)
'Falling' The Martin family, in Deanna Jent's compact play, is trying to live a normal life despite the outsize presence of their severely autistic son, Josh (effectively portrayed by Daniel Everidge). When a Bible-toting grandmother visits, the emotional temperature rises, and with it Josh's potential for violence. Despite some implausible stacking of the dramatic deck by the playwright, ''Falling'' makes some sound points and invites further investigation into the disorder (1:15). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (800) 982-2787, ticketmaster.com. (Andy Webster)
'5 Lesbians Eating a Quiche' This frolicsome play, about a women's club in 1956, ventures into such heady excesses of absurdism, it deserves to be called Mama-ist. (Dada wouldn't do at all.) As written by Evan Linder and Andrew Hobgood, with Sarah Gitenstein directing, ''Quiche'' takes a giant leap from punning smirkiness into the outer space of nonsense (1:15). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Van Dam Street, South Village, sohoplayhouse.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Forbidden Broadway: Alive and Kicking' Gerard Alessandrini's essential satirical cheat sheet to Broadway musicals returns after a three-year absence, packing polished brass knuckles. A precisionist cast of four provides vocal cartoons as evocative as Al Hirschfeld's caricatures. This show not only tickles but also pierces the Achilles' heels of the productions under scrutiny (1:40). At the 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Forever Dusty' If Kristen Holly Smith turned up to your costume party in Dusty Springfield drag and started singing, there would be no mistaking the woman she was channeling. But doing a passable impersonation is a far cry from capturing the essence of one of the most distinctive female vocalists of all time, as this amateurish inflated cabaret act demonstrates. Written in by-the-numbers basics by Ms. Smith and Jonathan Vankin, and directed with minimal finesse by Randal Myler, this misconceived bio-musical is a soulless tribute to the platinum-haired, panda-eyed queen of white soul. She deserves better (1:40). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, foreverdusty.net. (Rooney)
&#x2605; 'Fried Chicken and Latkes' Rain Pryor, the daughter of the comedian Richard Pryor (who died in 2005), stars in this effervescent solo show, which recounts her upbringing in a biracial household (her mother is Jewish) in Beverly Hills, Calif. Ms. Pryor, who sings and portrays a range of characters (including, poignantly, her father in a spot-on impression) is an ebullient performer with a robust singing voice. She lives in Baltimore now, but her outsize personality is built for Broadway (1:30). Actor's Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Webster)
'Giant' Michael John LaChiusa's lush score for this adaptation of Edna Ferber's generation-spanning 1952 novel reaches for the clouds. But the countervailing weight of condensing a multitude of themes and plot points keeps pulling this show down to earth, and even threatens to bury it. Michael Greif directs an attractive cast led by Brian D'Arcy James and Kate Baldwin (3:15). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org. (Brantley)
'Golden Child' The first production in the Signature Theater's season devoted to the work of David Henry Hwang is a revival of his 1996 play about a family in early-20th-century China grappling with the encroaching ideals of the West. Juliana Soelistyo, who starred in the original production as the young woman whose bound feet become a bone of contention, is a standout as the sternest and most recalcitrant of the three wives in the family (2:00). Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529, signaturetheatre.org. (Isherwood)
'The Good Mother' Gretchen Mol (''Boardwalk Empire'') plays the title role of a troubled young woman with man problems in Francine Volpe's murky, sluggish drama, directed by Scott Elliott for the New Group (1:40). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
'If There Is I Haven't Found It Yet' Jake Gyllenhaal makes a very creditable New York stage debut as the stoner uncle of a troubled 15-year-old girl (Annie Funke) in Nick Payne's earnest, shaggy (and conceptually overwrought) story of global warming and domestic meltdown. Michael Longhurst directs a cast rounded out by Brian F. O'Byrne and Michelle Gomez (1:35). Laura Pels Theater, Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Brantley)
'Ivanov' Boredom comes in many flavors in Chekhov's early study of provincial lives, and darned if Austin Pendleton's production doesn't provide a different acting style for each one. The lusty comic energy of the show's first half peters out in the second. Ethan Hawke strips the gears of suffering in the title role; Joely Richardson is superb as his neglected wife (3:00). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (866) 811-4111, classicstage.org. (Brantley)
'Love in the Time of Cholera' Directed by Jos Zayas and performed by an efficient four-actor crew, Caridad Svich's adaptation of the Gabriel Garca Mrquez novel is pleasing but lightweight. A production cannot live on romance alone. In Spanish with subtitles (2:00). Sunday at 2:30 only. Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street, (212) 889-2850, repertorio.org (Claudia La Rocco)
&#x2605; 'Mies Julie' The temperature never stops rising in Yael Farber's blistering drama, which resets Strindberg's ''Miss Julie'' in contemporary South Africa. But be advised: This is a fire that chills as it destroys. Hilda Cronje and Bongile Mantsai give full-immersion performances as the doomed lovers whose very identities come under siege. Ms. Farber directs, compellingly and mercilessly (1:30). St. Ann's Warehouse, 29 Jay Street, at Plymouth Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn, (718) 254-8779, stannswarehouse.org. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Murder Ballad' A small but savvy musical that panders in style to those of us who lap up febrile accounts of fatal attractions. Julia Jordan and Juliana Nash's contemporary tale of a razor-edged love triangle knows exactly what it wants to do, and does it most efficiently, with a sexy four-member cast, directed by Trip Cullman (1:15). City Center, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org. (Brantley)
'Old Jews Telling Jokes' With old jokes, a few songs and a little schmaltz, this winning revue is simple, effective entertainment executed with obvious affection (1:20). Westside Theater, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Jason Zinoman)

'The Outgoing Tide' The Philadelphia playwright Bruce Graham examines right-to-die issues as reflected in the tough choices made by a retired trucking company owner facing encroaching dementia. Starring Peter Strauss, Michael Learned and Ian Lithgow, the play maps the man's emotionally fraught standoff with his wife of 50 years and their adult son as he seeks to atone for his mistakes while sparing himself further indignity. Well received in its regional engagements, the play is sensitively observed and affecting if somewhat pedestrian in Bud Martin's production (2:10). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-4200, 59e59.org. (Rooney)
&#x2605; 'The Piano Lesson' August Wilson's Pulitzer Prize-winning play, set in Pittsburgh in 1936, returns in a galvanizingly beautiful staging by Ruben Santiago-Hudson, featuring memorable performances virtually across the board. A highlight of the year in theater (2:50). Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529, signaturetheatre.org. (Isherwood)
'Radiance' Set in 1955 with a detour back to 10 years earlier, Cusi Cram's play centers on an Air Force veteran desperate to bail on his commitment to appear on an episode of ''This Is Your Life.'' Elaborating on a curious real-life collision between one of the most momentous events in 20th-century military history and a now-quaint relic of American television, Suzanne Agins's production for the Labyrinth Theater Company dulls the conflict with fussy retro-styled treatment. Both the writing and the staging appear to be aping 1940s and '50s movie conventions, but the actors seem uncomfortable with the artifice. Only David Meyer's detailed set, a dive bar off Hollywood Boulevard, looks like the real thing (1:20). Bank Street Theater, 155 Bank Street, West Village, (212) 513-1080, labtheater.org. (Rooney)
'A Summer Day' In her first New York stage appearance in more than a decade, Karen Allen is perfectly cast as a woman frozen in time in Jon Fosse's quietly brutal play, which turns a romantic clich into an existential life sentence. Sarah Cameron Sunde adapted and directs this minimalist Norwegian work, which exerts an eerie dramatic undertow (1:20). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, West Village, (866) 811-4111, rattlestick.org. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Tribes' Nina Raine's smart, lively and beautifully acted play asks us to hear how we hear, in silence as well as speech. This British import considers the passive and aggressive forms of listening within an insular, intellectual family, whose members include a deaf son. David Cromer is the expert director (2:15). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com. (Brantley)
'The Twenty-Seventh Man' Nathan Englander's stage adaptation of his crisp, economical short story (from the collections ''For the Relief of Unbearable Urges'') feels sadly bloated and static onstage, despite fine work from a first-rate cast that includes Ron Rifkin and Chip Zien (1:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org. (Isherwood)
'Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike' Nomenclature would seem to be fate for the title characters of Christopher Durang's sunny comedy about gloomy people. David Hyde Pierce, Kristine Nielsen and Sigourney Weaver portray three siblings (if not three sisters) whose parents burdened them with Chekovian names. Nicholas Martin directs this surprisingly mild-mannered work from a savage satirist (2:30). (On Friday at 6 p.m., Mr. Durang and Mr. Martin will participate in a free preperformance talk in the lobby of the Vivian Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center.) Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'We Are Proud to Present a Presentation About the Herero of Namibia, Formerly Known as Southwest Africa, From the German Sudwestafrika, Between the Years 1844-1915' A group of six actors engage in tense rehearsals for a play about the first genocide of the 20th century in Jackie Sibblies Drury's inventive, superbly acted drama about the disturbing emotions stirred by their seemingly playful interactions (1:30). Soho Rep, 46 Walker Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101, sohorep.org. (Isherwood)
'The Whale' The gentle giant at the heart of Samuel D. Hunter's affecting if somewhat conventional drama is a lonely man named Charlie, who weighs upward of 500 pounds and is played with easygoing warmth by Shuler Hensley (1:55).

Off Off Broadway
'Be Careful! The Sharks Will Eat You!' (closes on Sunday) In his one-man show, Jay Alvarez recounts his family's escape from Cuba in 1964, when he was just 4. Acting at least a half-dozen roles, Mr. Alvarez is an evocative taleteller when reliving the yearlong plans his father made that delivered as many as 30 refugees by boat to the United States. Despite the title, though, and to the play's disadvantage, he describes almost nothing of the 30-hour voyage itself (1:30). Stage Left Studio, 214 West 30th Street, Manhattan, stageleftstudio.net.

'Radio City Christmas Spectacular' After last year's update, this annual extravaganza returns with a paucity of new material. But the Rockettes are forever splendid: regal in their precision, radiant in their costumes, exuberant in their high kicks. Yes, there's a cheesy narrative thread, but also a new and fascinating look at Rockettes fashions through the decades. (It's the troupe's 85th year.) And then there are those dancers, as much a timeless New York treasure as the view from the Empire State Building (1:30). Radio City Music Hall, (866) 858-0008, ticketmaster.com. (Webster)

Last Chance
'A Celebration of Harold Pinter' (closes on Friday) Julian Sands bravely takes on the voice of Pinter the poet in a modest, affecting production that looks for the private person within the artist. By the evening's end, the show, directed by John Malkovich, has also become a celebration of the actor's craft (1:45).

'Checkers' (closes on Sunday) Though briskly paced and attractively packaged, Douglas McGrath's play about a beleaguered young Richard Nixon often seems to float in stylistic limbo, between two or three dimensions. Terry Kinney directs an accomplished cast led by Anthony LaPaglia in the title role and Kathryn Erbe, who brings startling emotional heft to the role of Pat Nixon (1:45).

&#x2605; 'Figaro' (closes on Sunday) The playwright Charles Morey rescues Pierre-Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais's late-18th-century comedy ''The Marriage of Figaro'' from the shadow of its more celebrated operatic incarnation with this witty new adaptation for the Pearl Theater Company, inaugurating the classical troupe's new home on West 42nd Street. Directed with a light touch and an infectious wink by Hal Brooks, the farce takes aim at ruling-class entitlement just as surely today as it did in pre-Revolution France. The energetic ensemble is led by Sean McNall and Jolly Abraham as the crafty servant Figaro and his bride-to-be, and Chris Mixon as the lascivious Count determined to get a piece of pre-wedding action (2:10).

'Golden Land' (closes on Sunday) The upbeat six-person ensemble in this National Yiddish Theater-Folksbiene production presents the entire New York Jewish immigrant experience, from the 1880s to the 1940s. In montages and medleys, partly in Yiddish and partly in English, the audience is transported from Ellis Island to the Holocaust and beyond. The characters are more or less generic immigrant archetypes, but the actors are indefatigable (2:00). Baruch Performing Arts Center, 55 Lexington Avenue, at 25th Street, nationalyiddishtheatre.org. (Catherine Rampell)
'Inner Voices' (closes on Sunday) The poignant ''Arlington,'' with Alexandra Silber as a lonely wartime wife, is the standout in this evening of three one-act solo musicals.

(Gates)
&#x2605; 'Neutral Hero' (closes on Saturday) This remarkable new work from the experimentalist auteur Richard Maxwell takes place somewhere between the snug burg of Thornton Wilder's ''Our Town'' and the wine-dark seas of Homer's ''Odyssey.''

'Skin Tight' (closes on Saturday) Gary Henderson's nonlinear retelling of a passionate, pugnacious couple's romance and struggles -- inspired by ''The Magpies,'' a poem by a New Zealander, Denis Glover -- features intense and alive performances by Sarah-Jane Casey and Peter Saide, who spend much of their time onstage slapping, punching and even stabbing each other (1:00). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-4200, 59e59.org. (Rampell)
&#x2605; 'Sorry' (closes on Sunday) Set on Nov. 6, 2012 (Election Day), Richard Nelson's play -- the third in his Apple family series -- is about as big and as small as a domestic drama can be. Acted by a wonderful cast of five, ''Sorry'' keeps us aware of how every seemingly insignificant detail in one family's life is infused by a much larger picture (1:45).

Heidi Armbruster, above, with Mr. Mandvi, portrays the lawyer's wife, an artist whose profile is on the rise, with a natural poise (1:20).

HEADLINE: Road Tolls Proliferate as State Financing Falls Short

BYLINE: By AMAN BATHEJA. 
abatheja@texastribune.org

 BODY:
The first major toll road in Texas, which opened in 1957, was a 30-mile, six-lane stretch of highway between Dallas and Fort Worth. A drive from one end to the other cost 50 cents.
By 1977, tolls had generated enough revenue to recoup the cost of the road's construction, and the tollbooths were dutifully removed. Drivers know the Dallas-Fort Worth Turnpike as Interstate 30.
Fast forward 35 years and I-30, while still free, is surrounded by billions of dollars in road projects featuring toll roads or lanes. It is a similar story on a smaller scale in the state's other urban centers as well as in some communities along the border with Mexico.
As public officials across fast-growing Texas look for ways to build more roads in the midst of a lack of public financing, toll revenue or investment from private firms hoping to collect that toll revenue are repeatedly emerging as the antidote. 
But many critics say charging tolls in Texas has shifted from an if-we-absolutely-must option to the default approach for major road projects.
''The day will surely come when, if you want to get from point A to point B, you're not going to have a choice but to get on a toll road,'' State Senator John Carona, Republican of Dallas, said at a panel discussion at the Texas Tribune Festival in September on transportation financing. ''Well then, suddenly, a toll is just another tax. Let's not kid one another.''
Another factor in the current toll boom is Texas' transportation financing system, which falls far short of the state's needs. Federal and state gas taxes are the primary revenue source for road construction and maintenance.
Despite rising construction costs and the improving fuel efficiency of cars, Texans pay the same 38.4 cents in federal and state taxes per gallon of gas as they did nearly 20 years ago. In recent years, the Texas Department of Transportation has borrowed billions of dollars to finance transportation projects.
A 2009 report by an advisory committee said Texas should invest about $4 billion more per year on its current road system just to prevent congestion from worsening. As proposals to raise more transportation revenue have failed to draw sufficient political support, charging a toll is now seen as one of the few viable paths to developing major routes.
''It's a tool you have to utilize in today's economic climate with the resources that we have,'' Phil Wilson, the executive director of the Texas Department of Transportation, said in September. Mr. Wilson also stressed that various officials from local communities must approve a toll project before it can move forward.
During the last six years, Texas has built more than 150 miles of toll roads. Well over 100 miles of additional toll projects are in the works.
The Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth areas lead the state in collecting tolls. The Harris County Toll Road Authority and the North Texas Tollway Authority are the country's ninth- and 10th-largest toll agencies in terms of revenue, collecting $881 million in 2011, according to the International Bridge, Tunnel and Turnpike Association.
Michael Morris, transportation director for the North Central Texas Council of Governments, credits tolls for the $14 billion in new road projects under construction in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.
''If you're the fourth-largest region in the country and you're growing by one million people every 10 years, you have to do something,'' Mr. Morris said. ''Whatever money we have now, it has to go to the maintenance of the system. So if we're going to have to build capacity, we're going to have to do it with new toll lanes or a new toll road.''
Yet toll projects are extending to smaller and poorer parts of Texas like El Paso and Brownsville. In Hidalgo County in South Texas, the three toll road projects in development are viewed as preferable to raising taxes on the community, said Mike Perez, the McAllen city manager.
''The feeling is if you want to use it, you should pay for it,'' Mr. Perez said. ''That's what I see in McAllen. There's a kind of hesitancy toward 'Lets all go together and pay for it so 20 percent can use it.' ''
Adding to the increase in toll projects is interest from the private sector to build and run them. The financing of the original Dallas-Fort Worth Turnpike -- drivers pay tolls only until the bonds issued to finance the road's construction are paid off -- is now often replaced by comprehensive development agreements designed to last for decades.
Cintra, a toll operator based in Spain, is the lead company in three large Texas toll projects, including the state's first privately operated toll road, a segment of State Highway 130 from Austin to Seguin that opened in October. The terms of all three contracts allow Cintra to collect tolls on the roads for roughly 50 years.
Nicolas Rubio, the president of Cintra's American arm, based in Austin, said contracts for such long periods are the only way companies like his can recoup their large upfront investments.
''When you really look at these projects, the bulk of the revenues are back-ended, and you need to be patient until you can be able to get back that money,'' Mr. Rubio said.
He pointed to the LBJ Express, a project that will rebuild parts of Interstate 635 and Interstate 35E in Dallas and add toll lanes. A consortium led by Cintra is providing $2.2 billion in financing for the $2.7 billion project, and will maintain the corridor through 2061 in exchange for a portion of the toll revenue.
In 2009, the Texas Department of Transportation estimated that the project would yield $18.1 billion for a private firm over the life of the contract, public records show.
The first segment of the LBJ Express is expected to open toward the end of 2013, years earlier than would have been possible without private money, according to the Texas Department of Transportation.
Last year, the Legislature gave the department approval to pursue partnerships with private firms on seven road projects. Some business leaders are pushing for the approval of more such agreements while others hope that lawmakers create a more reliable revenue stream for the state's highway fund.
Amid the debate, some communities are proceeding cautiously with their initial forays into collecting tolls. El Paso's first toll lanes will open next year along part of the Csar Chvez Border Highway despite concerns that the area is too poor for the project to draw enough paying drivers. El Paso officials added a clause to the city's agreement with the Texas Department of Transportation that requires the toll lanes to convert to free ones if, after 15 years, the project is not paying for itself.
State Representative Joe C. Pickett, Democrat of El Paso, said the clause ensures that El Paso is not stuck with underused toll lanes while traffic on the road's free lanes continues to worsen.
''It's not going to make us any money for a long time,'' Mr. Pickett said. ''They're going to have to at least work on this and make sure it's something people are going to want to use.''
Paying the Price: This is the first article in a series on the increasing number of toll roads and lanes around the state.

HEADLINE: Evolving Toward Ecstasy

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH

 BODY:
The great French modernist Henri Matisse (1869-1954) was not a joiner. In the early 20th century he led the brief blitz of the Fauves -- those ''wild beasts'' of fiery colors and blunt textures -- but otherwise abstained from the signal movements of modern art.
He communed with artists of the distant or not-so-distant past, from Giotto to Czanne, and periodically brushed shoulders with Cubism and the work of his chief rival, Picasso. But his main desire was, as he put it, to ''push further and deeper into true painting.'' This project was in every sense an excavation, and he achieved it partly by digging into his own work, revisiting certain scenes and subjects again and again and at times also making superficially similar if drastically divergent copies of his paintings.
His rigorous yet unfettered evolution is the subject of ''Matisse: In Search of True Painting'' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, one of the most thrillingly instructive exhibitions about this painter, or painting in general, that you may ever see. As ravishing as it is succinct, it skims across this French master's long, productive career with a mere 49 paintings, but nearly all are stellar if not pivotal works. 
Organized at the Met by Rebecca Rabinow, a curator of modern and contemporary art, this exhibition, which is in previews for members through Sunday and opens to nonmembers on Tuesday, sheds new light on Matisse's penchant for copying and working in series. (It was seen in somewhat different versions at the Pompidou Center in Paris and the National Gallery of Denmark in Copenhagen.) To this end, the paintings proceed in pairs or groups aligned by subject: two still-life arrangements with fruit and compote, from 1899; two versions of a young sailor slouching in a chair, from 1906; four views (1900 to 1914) of Notre Dame seen from Matisse's window across the Seine; three portraits (1916-17) of Laurette, a favorite dark-haired model, seen from various distances in a voluminous green robe from Morocco.
The final gallery offers five paintings from the late 1940s that render Matisse's Vence studio in flat, saturated colors and pulsating patterns of plants and textiles. They are among the last canvases he made before embarking on the great final voyage of his cutouts.
The textbook simplicity of this format is irresistible. The visual self-schooling particular to looking at art kicks in, and almost before you know it your eyes are off and running, darting back and forth, parsing differences in style, brushwork, color, detail and overall effect, the expression of emotion that Matisse said he was always after.
Spread through eight galleries whose spaciousness aids concentration, each pair or group forms its own mini-seminar. Together they show Matisse restlessly roving between extremes, relentlessly rethinking and revising his way to greatness with radical ideas about economy and finish that changed the course of painting. His palette is rarely less than audaciously original. Attention should be paid to his habit of painting dark colors over bright ones to create a subtle underglow and his frequent emphasis on blank canvas as a source of light and texture. Always he sought an implicitly modern directness and rawness that created a brave new intimacy among artist, object and viewer. He claimed to work ''toward what I feel; toward a kind of ecstasy.''
Matisse's practice of copying grew out of his academic training, which by long tradition involved copying old masters in the Louvre. But he shifted this exercise toward the present, copying far more contemporary works, trying out different, mostly Post-Impressionist styles. The first gallery includes a still life homage to Czanne (1904) and another work depicting the same arrangement in the Pointillist-based manner of Paul Signac (1904-5). Even more interesting are two 1899 still lifes with compote and fruit. One is richly painted, an encompassing Post-Impressionist tribute (van Gogh, Gauguin, Czanne, Vuillard) cast in a honeyed light. The other is spare, almost skeletal: the fruit and vessels are denoted by flat silhouettes of bright color, the cabinet on which they rest by mostly unpainted canvas. Natural light as such is absent, but the seeds of all Matisse's great economies are here.
Which of these two canvases came first is debated by scholars. Did Matisse start with the simpler version and like it so much that he deemed it finished, and so switched to a second canvas to make the richer if more conventional Neo-Impressionist medley he originally intended? Or did he paint the more heavily worked canvas first and then, attempting something more pared down, lose his nerve and leave the second unfinished? Either way, Matisse was already beginning to use copying as a way to take the same motif to different pictorial conclusions, shifting from opulent to austere, or austere to opulent. In the case of two 1906 ''Young Sailor'' paintings, the first can be read as an overworked farewell to Fauvism, while the second cuts to the chase, conveying its subject with consummate abbreviating ease against a flat pink background as if dispatched in a single work session. (Its simplicity apparently made Matisse a little uneasy; when he showed these canvases to the collector Leo Stein, he dissembled briefly, saying that the second had been painted by a rural letter carrier.) Meanwhile he seems almost to have abandoned the 1909 ''Seated Nude,'' with its patchy color, flurries of pencil and disturbing doll-like face, for its more robust twin of the same year, ''Nude With a White Scarf,'' more conventionally fleshed out in paint and thick black lines.
It is possible to spend your entire visit in the second and third galleries of this mesmerizing exhibition, mulling over the sailors, the nudes with white scarves, the more regal nude with attendants of ''Le Luxe I'' and ''Le Luxe II'' of 1907-8 (Matisse's ''Birth of Venus''?) or the contrasting psychological chords and spatial treatments of the Laurettes. The Museum of Modern Art's magisterial ''Goldfish and Palette,'' with its fractured, quasi-Cubist transparencies and incessantly scratched paint, overpowers its more demure cousin, ''Interior With Goldfish'' (both 1914), until you notice that in this second work the hot orange of the goldfish glimmers subversively through almost the entire surface.
And it is almost shocking to see that the Modern's great, sketchily painted, nearly all-blue ''View of Notre Dame'' (1914) has an unlikely fraternal twin from the same year: a relatively realistic view of that cathedral that might almost be a blowup of a postcard except for the daring brevity of its watercolor-thin pastel colors and frequent passages of exposed canvas. Both paintings challenge conventional notions of finish, though from almost opposite directions.
But there is much more on offer. Two relatively comfy views of Matisse's first hotel room in Nice are traduced by the grandeur of ''Interior With a Violin,'' a larger third version whose prevailing shades of black dramatically highlight the bit of sunbaked beach visible through the louvered shutters. Three views of the beach at tretat, on the coast of northern France, revisit a scene beloved by Monet, presenting different catches of the day while experimenting with deep space and variously notational ways of indicating pebbles, bluff and water.
In the 1930s Matisse began having black-and-white photographs taken of his paintings at regular intervals as he worked on them. This was clearly another way to preserve artistic ideas for future use, but he also sent photographs to clients and further valued them as proof against critics' claims that his paintings were casually dashed off. In 1945 he went so far as to exhibit six paintings, each surrounded by its matching photographs, at Galerie Maeght in Paris. The seventh gallery of the Met show presents three of the Maeght canvases amid their evidentiary pictures. They establish that Matisse's progress was often grueling and yet, especially with the ornate vessels and shell in ''Still Life With Magnolia'' (1941) and the sleeping model in peasant blouse of ''The Dream'' (1940), he worked through his difficulties to a final image that exudes consummate freshness and ease.
By the time you reach this point in this astounding exhibition, it is clear that Matisse's paintings are almost always hard-won distillations, but it is nonetheless marvelous to see the process so forthrightly chronicled. His ecstasy was built on numerous forms of transparency.
''Matisse: In Search of True Painting'' opens Tuesday and runs through March 17 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art; (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org.

HEADLINE: No 'Plan B' for Pentagon In Case of Big Budget Cut

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

 BODY:
Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower famously said that plans are nothing, but planning is everything because no war plan survives first contact with the enemy. Therefore, the military should hone its ability for continuous planning.
In the decades since, the Pentagon has excelled at nothing as much as planning for every conceivable - and sometimes inconceivable - contingency.
So it is more than a little surprising that a range of Defense Department and military officials say there is no formal planning under way on how the Pentagon budget could or should be trimmed further. 
Cuts of $500 billion over the next 10 years, representing roughly 5 to 8 percent of the Pentagon's budget, would begin to take effect if the White House and Congress fail to reach an accord before the end of the year. The reductions would occur across the board. Even if there is a deal on taxes and spending to avoid the automatic cuts, it is a safe bet that the deal would impose additional budget reductions on the Pentagon.
Pentagon officials and military officers do not say it out loud, but their public inaction reflects a fear that any planning on cuts would amount to an invitation to Congress to make them. The Pentagon could then face larger reductions than it otherwise might as part of any deficit deal.
What programs could be vulnerable? Experts offer varying proposals, of course, depending on what branch of the military they think is most important and what sort of world they predict America will face.
Gen. Ray Odierno, the Army chief of staff, noted in a recent talk at the Center for Strategic and International Studies that there are only three large baskets of spending from which savings can be found: personnel costs; equipment costs, both for repairs and new orders; and training costs, like how many bullets are available for firing on practice ranges and how many hours can be logged in jet fighter training flights.
A study released this week by Todd Harrison and Mark Gunzinger of the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a Washington research group, recommended protecting a series of military capabilities, which it called "the crown jewels," necessary in a future combat environment. They included: Special Operations forces, cyberspace capabilities, underwater warfare systems and long-range surveillance and strike aircraft, both manned and unmanned.
Gordon Adams, a former Pentagon official in the Reagan administration and an advocate of further military cuts, has said there is unusual agreement among analysts across the political spectrum on the way ahead in military spending.
In an essay for the Web site of Foreign Policy magazine, Mr. Adams said that long-term wars of attrition and nation-building, like in Afghanistan and Iraq, were "over," allowing the ground forces to shrink. Analysts, he wrote, also agree that the United States can reduce its strategic nuclear arsenal, but that research and development should be protected.
Any future reductions for the Pentagon would come on top of $487 billion in spending cuts the Obama administration plans to make over the next decade.
After a decade of sharply rising military spending and revenues diminished by two tax cuts and two recessions, Pentagon officials say that they are aware that a new period has begun. Their goal is to limit the cuts they face to the ones that have already been planned, and to certainly avoid the across-the-board cuts that will start to take effect if Congress does not reach a deal by year's end.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Racial Redefinition in Progress

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER

 BODY:
In 2001 the Studio Museum in Harlem opened a group exhibition called ''Freestyle,'' the first in what would be a series intended to introduce freshly minted African-American talent. And in the catalog for that show the curator, Thelma Golden, dropped a neat little cultural bomb. She referred to the group of artists she'd chosen, most of them then in their 20s, as ''post-black.''
Heads spun, and are still spinning. Artists of an older generation, particularly those deeply invested in lifelong issues of black pride, were angry. The handle-hungry art market was flummoxed, unsure of how to capitalize on the label.
Even some young artists to whom it was applied weren't quite clear about what to do with it. Overnight the dynamics of contemporary art changed. 
Although little noted in the midst of the uproar at the time, Ms. Golden herself held the term ''post-black'' at a critical distance, floating it out as a proposition rather than advancing it as a polemic. For her it meant artists who were adamant about not being confined to the category of ''black,'' though, as she wrote, ''their work was deeply interested in redefining complex notions of blackness. Post-black,'' she added with a wry twist, ''was the new black.''
More than a decade later it still is, to judge by the fourth and latest of the museum's new-generation shows, this one titled ''Fore,'' organized by three young staff curators, Lauren Haynes, Naima J. Keith and Thomas J. Lax. Like its predecessors it keeps racial politics alive but discreet and covers the waterfront in terms of mediums, which it samples and mixes with turntablist flair.
In line with current New York trends, painting gets major attention. Three smallish portraits by Jennifer Packer (born 1985; Yale M.F.A. 2012) of art-school friends kick things off. They're traditional looking and beautiful, their suave brushwork finessed with a palette knife. Portraits by another artist, Toyin Odutola, who was born in Nigeria and now lives in Los Angeles, are more offbeat and generate interesting ideas. Ms. Odutola makes her sitters so black that their forms read like solid, featureless silhouettes from across a room. Only up close do you see that their eyes are wide open, and their skin is a porous weave of ropy ink lines, with rainbow color glinting through like light from behind.
Another Los Angeles artist, Kenyatta A. C. Hinkle, uses images from colonial-era postcards, made for European eyes, to make a point about the vulnerability of the body when seen through a racial lens. In her paint-altered version of the original cards, nude and seminude ''native'' women from West Africa are under assault from swarming lines of white pigment that bring to mind flames, microbes and spermatozoa.
Then the figure vanishes. It's just a shadowy smudge on an abstract gold field in a diptych by Noah Davis, and absent altogether in abstract paintings by Kianja Strobert, Sienna Shields and Brenna Youngblood.
Ms. Youngblood looks particularly impressive here. She has, however temporarily, exchanged her complicated, object-laden painting mode of a few years ago for a near-Minimalist austerity. But nothing she does is simple. One 2012 picture in the show consists primarily of a plain white unmarked panel, yet the addition of a small scrap of stuck-on signage keeps her art in painting-plus-something-else terrain.
And ''something else'' in this show covers a lot of ground. What conventional formal category, or categories, can describe Harold Mendez's filmy, soot-black Veronica veils made from dryer sheets, ink and fabric softener? Or Cullen Washington Jr.'s ''Caped Crusader,'' with its collaged black baby superhero anchored to the floor by a T-Mobile sign? Or Eric Nathaniel Mack's ''Honey Hollow,'' consisting of nothing more than a paint-brushed blanket hanging loose on the wall and stirred by the breeze from a nearby fan?
Unprepossessing to the eye, it does a lot of conceptual hard work, mashing together the essences of painting, sculpture and kinetic installation. Depending on who's looking, the piece is either barely there, or a sly celebration of material movement in space, of performance art without bodies.
Performance art has a significant place in ''Fore,'' as it does in the local art world these days, with blackness weaving in and out of it. It's hard to locate in a choreographically executed wall drawing by Taisha Paggett, but forms the troubled heart of a two-channel video by Nicole Miller.
On one screen Ms. Miller appears, coached by a white ballet instructor in a pristine studio as she practices classical barre exercises she learned as a child. On the other screen a group of young black woman, with men hovering, rehearse a sexually explicit form of Caribbean popular dance called daggering in a murky Brooklyn nightclub. The piece asks: Is there a connection between the two scenes? Yes. And what's the connection? No answer.
Quite different in spirit, though in its way no less inquiring, is a video called ''Reifying Desire: Model It,'' by the speedily emerging young artist Jacolby Satterwhite. The piece was made for the show and connects whole cultural worlds.
Mr. Satterwhite is its star, and a natural one. Resplendent in spandex suits and sequined wraps, he vogues up a storm in one digitally enhanced setting after another. But the dance sequences are just one part of an exercise in multimedia maximalism that encompasses fashion, Dada, the Home Shopping Network, Sun Ra, CVS pharmacy chic and highly specialized household appliances designed by Patricia Satterwhite -- the artist's mother and collaborator -- who calls on art to keep schizophrenia at bay.
Mr. Satterwhite will be doing his complex thing, live, in a two-part performance art program that the museum will roll out in December and February, events that give several other artists a chance to extend their range beyond what the galleries can hold.
Steffani Jemison -- one of the museum's 2012-13 artists in residence along with Ms. Packer and Mr. Washington -- will present a text piece based on urban street fiction of a kind sold in the neighborhood around the museum. The polymathic artist named Narcissister will offer staged equivalents of her gender-bending photo-collages in the show. Jamal Cyrus, from Houston, will deep-fry a tenor saxophone. And Kevin Beasley, whose faintly sinister, bundle-like sculptures sit on the floor here and there, will introduce an immersive sound environment, to which no one will be admitted late and from which no one will be allowed to leave early.
An environment of a different kind, Abigail DeVille's ''Haarlem Tower of Babel,'' is already in place in the museum's open-air courtyard. Assembled by Ms. DeVille from locally scavenged objects and materials (shopping carts, bottles, trash bags) and memorabilia from her grandmother's Bronx apartment, the piece speaks of life on the street, generational bonds, confusion, dispossession and not-having as a chronic, punishing but toughening condition.
These were themes often tackled by African-American artists in the past, including by some of those who founded the Studio Museum in Harlem in the 1960s. And the themes remain relevant now, when the country is coming out of a presidential election shot through with racism, when African-American citizens are being hit disproportionately by a brutal economy, and when the art world, despite the multicultural surges of the recent past, still has scant room for black artists, black anything.
In the circumstances post-black feels like an iffy and unrealistic proposition. Yet it can work. Without identifying itself as ''black art,'' Ms. DeVille's installation brings hard, pertinent existential politics into the museum. And so, in less monumental ways, does other art in ''Fore,'' simply by bearing the clear, proud influence of older artists, living and gone, black and not. Romare Bearden and Robert Rauschenberg are among them. So are David Hammons and the other artists in ''Now Dig This! Art and Black Los Angeles 1960-1980'' at MoMA PS1. Some of the artists took part in the Studio Museum's three previous important post-black shows.
The young artists in ''Fore'' take something from all of these forebears but do something to and with it: reshape it, update it, understate it; conceptualize it, magnify or shrink it; and, increasingly it seems, cut it loose from labels. The point is that the something is always there, ready to be passed on, being passed on, no ''post'' about it.
''Fore'' continues through March 10 at the Studio Museum in Harlem, 144 West 125th Street; (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org.

HEADLINE: Prodigal Son, Dripping Sweat And Mystery

BYLINE: By BEN BRANTLEY

 BODY:
Any analysis of the chemical makeup of Norbert Leo Butz would surely reveal traces of gunpowder. How else to account for the fireworks that Mr. Butz is conjuring out of thin air at the Music Box Theater, where Theresa Rebeck's ''Dead Accounts'' opened on Thursday night?
Make that very thin air -- even emaciated air, if there is such a thing. This comedy about a prodigal son, returned from the wilds of New York City to his family in Cincinnati, seems to float out of memory even as you're watching it. Ms. Rebeck, the author of ''Seminar'' and ''Mauritius,'' keeps throwing out weighty subjects -- from the ethics of Wall Street to the existence of God -- but never cultivates them into anything approaching a solid existence. They all blur into a single jet stream of semisnappy dialogue before changing course a few times and evaporating.
Though the show, directed with an assortment of amiable diversionary tactics by Jack O'Brien, has the form and flavor of a conventional rom-com, you may still leave the theater wondering exactly what it was about; you may then wisely decide that such considerations are not worth the brain power. 
Anyway, it's entirely possible that you have gone to ''Dead Accounts'' just to see Mr. Butz, a two-time Tony winner, practice his pyrotechnics, or to show your support for Our Katie. That's Katie Holmes, the movie star and former Mrs. Tom Cruise, who has of late been the victim of relentless tabloid scrutiny.
Let me assure you that Ms. Holmes, who was a tad unsteady in her Broadway debut four years ago in Arthur Miller's ''All My Sons,'' appears much more at ease playing a worn-down country mouse to the hyped-up city mouse of Mr. Butz. Gamely unkempt and lumpen, Ms. Holmes suggests what might have happened to Joey Potter, the ultimate girl-next-door she once portrayed on TV in ''Dawson's Creek,'' had she never found true love or left town.
For at least its first 15 minutes ''Dead Accounts'' does manage to command your attention. That's because its first scene is essentially a sustained aria of nervous energy for Mr. Butz, whose inventively modulated intensity brings to mind the young John Malkovich hijacking the stage with his opening monologue in Lanford Wilson's ''Burn This'' some 25 years ago.
Mr. Butz plays Jack, the black (or golden-fleeced, depending on your interpretation) sheep among six siblings in Roman Catholic family. Jack is the one who went East to live big. As the play begins, he is fresh from Manhattan, wearing an Armani suit and a jangle of urban vibes. Like many self-invented New Yorkers, Jack is a grandstander, and he has an appreciative audience in Lorna (Ms. Holmes), the sister who has stayed home to look after their aging parents.
Pretty much everyone functions as Jack's audience, and not much else, during the first act. That includes Barbara (Jayne Houdyshell), his mother, whose (unseen) husband is upstairs suffering from kidney stones, and Phil (Josh Hamilton), the friend of his youth.
Whether working his way ecstatically through pints of Graeter's ice cream, a local delicacy, or rhapsodizing about the trees in the backyard, Jack is a devourer -- of food, of attention, of oxygen and, you might infer from his hyperkinetic pace, of pharmaceuticals. Or is he just overly charged with New York adrenaline? Ms. Rebeck devotes much compare-and-contrast time to Eastern versus Midwestern rhythms and mores. Whatever its source, Jack's atomic heat threatens to warp the linoleum tiles on the kitchen floor. (David Rockwell designed the Norman Rockwell-ish set.)
This Jumping Jack Flash is not only a gas but also quite possibly toxic. The tantalizing early hints of danger in Mr. Butz's performance are underscored by Jack's jokey references to murder; by David Weiner's sinister lighting between scenes; and by Mark Bennett's sound design, which blends recordings of cozy standards like ''Sentimental Journey'' with ominous, horror-movie crackles.
Yep, Jack's got a secret, which -- after a lot of cute family quarreling and reminiscing that might have been lifted from an episode of ''Everybody Loves Raymond'' -- is revealed at the end of the first act, when a woman in black, played by Judy Greer, shows up on the doorstep, chic and glowering. This should strike a chord of suspense. But somehow ''Dead Accounts'' has already turned into a limp chain of anticlimaxes.
This is mostly because Ms. Rebeck doesn't seem to have settled on a tone or, for that matter, a subject. ''Dead Accounts'' is, I think, meant to be about the inflation of the superficial in a materialistic society, and the attendant, unsatisfied craving for belief. (The title refers to bank accounts that are of no use to anyone; more I cannot reveal.)
But the play never follows through convincingly on any of its ideas. The breezy, family-friction antics that run throughout don't tally with the script's abrupt U-turns into ponderousness. Even Mr. Butz has difficulty pulling off Jack's second-act lament on the emptiness of an existence ''where we are nothing and money is the only thing -- and we are just reptiles.'' (Come to think of it, that sounds like something Mr. Butz's character might have said in the short-lived Broadway docudrama ''Enron.'') Even worse: Lorna's segue from a discussion of ''dead accounts'' to the angry announcement that ''death is coming to this house.''
Mr. Hamilton, who is terrific at playing cads, here has the thankless task of being the blandest of good guys. Ms. Greer never transcends her character's function as a visitor-from-another-planet plot device. Ms. Houdyshell (''Well,'' ''Follies'') glows with wry maternal warmth, as is her wont, and soaks up most of the audience's good will.
Despite the differences between their characters' metabolisms (as well as their acting styles) Ms. Holmes and Mr. Butz summon an appealingly natural family rapport, especially in their first scene, which turns out to have been the show's high point. You may even forget that Ms. Holmes is Katie Holmes for a moment. Then again, ''Dead Accounts'' makes you forget a lot of things, like why you've bothered to come to the show to begin with.

HEADLINE: Income Inequality Sheds Its Taboo Status

BYLINE: By CHRYSTIA FREELAND | REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- When Branko Milanovic, a World Bank economist, published ''The Haves and the Have-Nots,'' a study of global income inequality, last year, one of his most striking observations was the extent to which the subject was taboo in the United States.
As Mr. Milanovic explained, ''I was once told by the head of a prestigious think tank in Washington, D.C., that the think tank's board was very unlikely to fund any work that had income or wealth inequality in its title. Yes, they would finance anything to do with poverty alleviation, but inequality was an altogether different matter.'' 
''Why?'' Mr. Milanovic asked. ''Because 'my' concern with the poverty of some people actually projects me in a very nice, warm glow: I am ready to use my money to help them. Charity is a good thing; a lot of egos are boosted by it and many ethical points earned even when only tiny amounts are given to the poor. But inequality is different: Every mention of it raises in fact the issue of the appropriateness or legitimacy of my income.''
I recalled Mr. Milanovic's remarks this week when I found myself on a panel at the Brookings Institution, one of those Washington research groups, discussing income inequality, including the research collected in a new book published by Brookings titled ''Inequality in America.'' In reply, Kemal Dervis, the vice president of Brookings, who co-wrote the book and led the panel, joked that if he turns up on the job market next month we will know he overstepped the mark.
It was a characteristically polished line -- Mr. Dervis is a former Turkish cabinet minister -- but the truth is that the Brookings event was a sign of the recent sea change in the U.S. public discourse about income inequality.
As recently as this summer, it still seemed like Americans were allergic to any explicit discussion of income inequality. That was the reasoning of Republicans and of many previously nonpartisan wealthy businessmen who responded to President Barack Obama's call for higher taxes on millionaires and billionaires with accusations of class war.
But at the polls in November, something surprising, at least for the Romney strategists, happened. A very muted, democratic version of class war was fought, and the lower classes won. As Mitt Romney put it in a conference call with his donors after the vote, a coalition of less well-off Americans re-elected Mr. Obama because he promised to use government to improve their lot.
Even the patriarch of American capitalists, Warren E. Buffett, has decided it is O.K. to talk about income inequality. In an op-ed in The New York Times and the International Herald Tribune this week, Mr. Buffett pointed out that the wealth of the 400 richest Americans has increased more than fivefold over the past 20 years. As Mr. Buffett put it, ''my gang has been leaving the middle class in the dust.''
The Brookings panel confirmed that assessment and offered three important takeaways about the causes and consequences of rising income inequality. One was that government matters. Like most students of the subject, the assembled economists agreed that rising inequality was driven partly by economic forces like the technology revolution and globalization.
But the state can choose to mute the impact of the invisible hand. Paradoxically, in much of the Western world, and particularly in the United States, even as the power of these economic shifts has become more profound, government efforts to mitigate them have become weaker. As Mr. Buffett pointed out, the effective tax rate paid by the 400 top earners in 1992 was 26.4 percent. By 2009, it had fallen to 19.9 percent -- even as the pretax gap between the plutocrats and everyone else had widened.
A second theme of the Brookings discussion helps to explain one reason that has happened -- the economy has gone global, but nation-states have not. Higher taxes on the rich may be a logical response to rising income inequality, but actually levying those taxes is getting harder in an age of global capital flows. Mr. Buffett said it was ''sickening'' that rich people and companies use the Cayman Islands to lower their tax bills, but moral outrage is a weak weapon against international tax arbitrage.
If you are still not convinced that all this matters, consider the third, and most striking, possibility raised at the Brookings panel. Set aside any moral or political concerns you may have about rising income inequality -- worries about poverty, justice, undue political influence or even social mobility. According to Mr. Dervis, and the research collected in ''Inequality in America,'' a growing number of economists suspect that once inequality passes a certain point it may jeopardize economic stability and economic growth.
As the book argues, ''rebalancing of the distribution of income may play a role in unlocking the U.S. economy's growth potential in a sustainable way.''
Now that is a truly radical thought, and it brings us back to Mr. Milanovic's earlier view that income inequality was a forbidden subject in the United States.
Worrying about the poor is one thing. To contend that equality is necessary for growth is an altogether different and more radical idea. Three decades later, trickle-down economics has met its antithesis. We are set for one of the great battles of ideas of our time.

HEADLINE: Exiting Mexican Leader to Go to Harvard

BYLINE: By KARLA ZABLUDOVSKY

 BODY:
MEXICO CITY -- President Felipe Caldern, who unleashed the military to take on drug traffickers and saw violence spiral out of control during his tenure, will move out of Mexico shortly after leaving office on Saturday. 
In January, Mr. Caldern will join the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard as the first Angelopoulos Global Public Leaders fellow, a one-year position created to give high-profile leaders leaving office time to write, lecture and generally share their experiences.
Mr. Caldern, 50, who earned a master's degree in public administration from the Kennedy School in 2000, will focus on ''the many policy challenges he encountered while serving as president,'' the school said in a news release that did not mention his biggest challenge: confronting the drug-trafficking organizations that have terrorized the country and fueled a war that left tens of thousands of people dead during his six years in office.
The school's statement praised other achievements, including his stewardship of the economy, which stabilized after a recession and is now growing faster than the United States'.
Mr. Caldern, who has a wife who has dabbled in politics and three young children, was long expected to leave Mexico, either because of safety considerations or to follow a custom of departing Mexican presidents, who generally do not stay.
''It's a tradition,'' said Shannon K. O'Neil, senior fellow for Latin America studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, ''to give your successor a little bit of space.''
Shortly after leaving the presidency in 1994 under a cloud, Carlos Salinas de Gortari went into self-imposed exile, traveling to New York, Montreal and Havana and finally settling in Dublin. He sought to be named the head of the World Trade Organization, but withdrew after his brother was arrested on charges of ordering the assassination of a Mexican politician.
His successor, Ernesto Zedillo, joined Yale University, his alma mater, as director of the Center for the Study of Globalization.
Vicente Fox, Mr. Caldern's immediate predecessor and a fellow member of the National Action Party, remained in Mexico in recent years.
He started a research group and kept his hand in politics, causing a stir last summer when he all but endorsed Enrique Pea Nieto of the rival Institutional Revolutionary Party for president. Mr. Pea Nieto won and takes office on Saturday.
Some analysts contend that security problems in Mexico would make it difficult for Mr. Caldern to stay, despite the government's provision of an extensive security detail for former presidents.
''Caldern is going to pay a high personal cost for having had the courage to take on the cartels, and part of it entails having to be away with his family for some time,'' said Gabriel Guerra, a political analyst and consultant.
Mr. Caldern's job hunt has brought some controversy.
After The Dallas Morning News reported in August that he was in talks with the University of Texas about a teaching position, students and faculty members started circulating a petition across the country blaming him for the deaths of young people in the drug war and calling on campuses to bar him.

HEADLINE: The Tibetan Cause Is Not Hopeless, Leader Says

BYLINE: GARDINER HARRIS


HIGHLIGHT: Lobsang Sangay says fight for independence mirrors that of Baltic states during the Cold War. 

 BODY:
The cause of Tibetan independence is not hopeless, Lobsang Sangay, leader of the Tibetan government-in-exile, said in an interview Thursday.
"There is hope, primarily because of the Tibetan spirit and their continuing assertion of identity, and the sense of unity and solidarity inside and outside of Tibet has never been stronger," Mr. Sangay said. 
Mr. Sangay likened the Tibetan struggle to those of the Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania during the Cold War. Soviet occupation of those countries seemed irreversible in the 1970s, he said, but the convulsive changes that followed the fall of the Berlin Wall eventually led to their independence.

"I remember talking to people from the Baltic States, and I asked them, 'Did you really believe in the 1980s that you would get back your homeland?'" Mr. Sangay said. "And they said, 'In our heads, no. In our hearts, yes.'"
Mr. Sangay was elected last year to be the Tibetan prime minister, or Sikyong, making him the leader of the Tibetan government-in-exile following the Dalai Lama's decision to surrender his governmental responsibilities to focus solely on his religious duties.
The government has about 1,000 employees and $22 million in annual revenues, which result from a voluntary tax on Tibetans as well as grants from governments and nongovernmental organizations. His government oversees 32 refugee schools located mostly in India and has recently launched a private health insurance scheme to protect Tibetan refugees from financial catastrophe following a family illness.
Mr. Sangay spoke while seated in a modest office building in New Delhi that serves as his government's embassy to the Indian government, its most important patron. Some 90,000 Tibetan exiles live in India, the most in the world.
He has proposed to the Chinese government what he said was a modest plan that would make Tibet an autonomous region within China. The Chinese have rejected the plan outright, he said.
He said that China's increasing economic and political might would help the Tibetan cause.
"Yes, China is gaining influence, but are they gaining respect?" he asked. "You gain respect by respecting your people first."
He noted that most Tibetans who are protesting Chinese rule were born long after Tibet was annexed by China.
"So even after 60 years, the Chinese government has yet to convince the Tibetan people that they should be under them," Mr. Sangay said.
Mr. Sangay lives in Dharamsala, with the rest of the Tibetan government-in-exile. He left his job as a senior fellow at Harvard to take up the post of prime minister, for which he is paid about $360 a month. His wife and 6-year-old daughter remain in Massachusetts.

HEADLINE: At the Doha Summit, India Pushes Developed Nations to Cut Emissions

BYLINE: BETWA SHARMA


HIGHLIGHT: Results have been disappointing, officials say. 

 BODY:
DOHA, Qatar -- At the United Nations climate change talks in Doha, India is taking an active role in asking developed nations to commit to ambitious carbon dioxide emission cuts and pledge money to combat the global challenge.
Delegates from 194 countries are attending a two-week-long annual conference on climate change here, which concludes on Dec. 7.
So far, developed nations have been mostly unresponsive to India's push. The European Union has agreed to 20 percent carbon emission cuts from 1990 levels for the period of 2013 to 2020, a level that advocates for cuts say had already been pledged earlier. This time frame is known as the "second commitment period" of the Kyoto Protocol, which is the only legally binding treaty on climate change. Four developed countries - Japan, New Zealand, Canada and Russia - have already backed out of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. 
"We are disappointed, however, that the developed countries are in the process of locking in low ambitions under this second commitment period," Meera Mehrishi, India's chief negotiator, said Thursday. "We call on them to raise their level of ambition consistent with what is required by science."
The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimated in a 2007 report that a 25 to 40 percent reduction of greenhouse gases from 1990 levels is needed to limit the earth's temperature rise to two degrees Celsius.
The United States, which is not a party to the Kyoto Protocol, remains firm on a position far from the goals the panel set: reducing carbon emissions by 17 percent from 2005 levels, an estimated 4 percent from 1990 levels.
Developing countries, meanwhile, are pushing developed countries, in and out of the treaty, to take emission cuts of 30 to 40 percent compared to 1990 levels. Developed nations should shoulder the burden of climate change, developing nations believe, because of their share of historical carbon emissions as well as poorer nations' need to develop now.
Developing countries are of the view that climate change negotiations must be based on the principles of "equity" and "common but differentiated responsibility" in the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, adopted in 1992, from which these negotiations emerged.
Still, the rapid growth of developing nations like China, India, Brazil and South Africa over the last decade has led the developed countries to distance themselves from these principles. China, for instance, is now the world's largest emitter of carbon dioxide, followed by the United States.
So far, large developing countries have only agreed to voluntary reductions in their carbon intensity, that is, the amount of carbon dioxide emitted per dollar generated by the country. India, for instance, has set a target of reducing emission intensity by 20 to 25 percent from 2005 levels by 2020.
Ms. Mehrishi noted that India's economic slowdown during the past year, from growth of almost 9 percent to just 5.5 percent, had resulted in a reduction of its emission intensity as well.
"It's just that the overall economic scenario in the world has also now impacted our country," she said. "Earlier, we were quite comfortable, we do have a problem now."
Meena Raman from the Third World Network, an international climate advocacy organization, said that since European Union countries had already committed to 20 percent emission cuts so there have been no improvements during the Doha talks.
"What the E.U. is coming to Doha with is essentially to do nothing for the next eight years, and the United States refuses to even talk about reviewing its pledge and raising its ambitions," she said. "Developing countries across the board are very upset at the low level of ambition."
Developing countries also see little progress on the goal of mobilizing $100 billion by 2020 for the issue. The so-called Green Climate Fund, set up after the 2010 talks in Cancun, Mexico, has been referred to as an "empty shell" by some negotiators.
"We do not have any kind of really meaningful initial capitalization of the Green Climate Fund," Bernarditas Muller, a negotiator from the Philippines, told delegates here. "Not a single cent that we could use in order to give to fulfill its functions of financing the needs of developing countries."
At Doha, the United States is pushing the international community to focus on a post-2020 regime, agreed to at the 2011 climate talks at Durban, South Africa, which will legally bind both developed and developing nations to reduce their carbon emissions.
The European Union, meanwhile, agreed to extend the Kyoto Protocol, which would have ended this year, only after developing countries agreed to the post-2020 agreement called the Durban Platform.
While the Durban Platform opens up a new front for negotiations, developing countries want previous commitments under discussion since the 2007 climate talks in Bali, Indonesia, to be brought to a logical end.
Ms. Mehrishi stressed that India's agreement to the Durban Platform was based on reassurances that outstanding issues of mitigation, adaptation and technology under the Bali Action Plan would be addressed. "We are therefore here in Doha to ensure that both of these are done satisfactorily," she said.
China echoed India's sentiments.
"We need to make the necessary arrangements for the implementation of all the actions we had agreed to undertake," Su Wei, China's chief negotiator, said this week.
The United States, however, is calling for a fresh start saying previous commitments only represented a bit more than 15 percent of global emissions.
"The task here at Doha is to close out the negotiations under the Bali round and to move on," Jonathan Pershing, a senior negotiator from the United States, told the media this week. "The new agreement must be built not for the world of 2007, when we adopted Bali, nor for 1997 or 1992, when we adopted the Kyoto Protocol and the convention respectively, but for the world of 2020 and beyond."

HEADLINE: Study May Offer Insight Into Coca-Cola Breach

BYLINE: NICOLE PERLROTH


HIGHLIGHT: A 2010 case study of a security breach at an unnamed Fortune 500 company appears to offers new details of a breach at Coca-Cola. 

 BODY:
Spend enough time with cybersecurity experts and chances are you will hear some variation of this line: There are two types of companies in the United States, those that have been hacked and those that don't yet know they've been hacked.
Government intelligence officials and cybersecurity specialists say hackers -- predominantly from China -- are siphoning gigabytes, if not terabytes, of data from companies in the United States every day. We count on much of this information to deliver the innovative products and services that will lead to new jobs and economic growth. The security software company McAfee estimates that in 2008 alone, companies around the world lost more than $1 trillion because of this sort of intellectual property theft. 
"I've seen behind the curtain," Shawn Henry, the Federal Bureau of Investigation.'s former top cyber agent, who recently joined the cybersecurity start-up CrowdStrike, told me in an interview in April. "I can't go into the particulars because it's classified, but the vast majority of companies have been breached."
The problem is that such breaches rarely make headlines because companies fear what disclosure will mean for their stock price. Google was the first to try to change that mentality when, in 2010,it disclosed that it and 34 other companies, many based in Silicon Valley, had been attacked by Chinese hackers. Of those 34, only Intel and Adobe Systems came forward, and they provided few details.
Still, news of some breaches leak out. That was the case, most recently, with Coca-Cola. This month, Bloomberg News reported that Coca-Cola was breached by Chinese hackers in 2009 during a failed $2.4 billion takeover attempt of the China Huiyuan Juice Group. That attempted deal would have been the largest foreign acquisition of a Chinese company.
Now, a 2010 case study published by the Mandiant Corporation, a cybersecurity firm, may offer further details. The study, which does not mention Coca-Cola specifically, details a 2009 breach of a "Fortune 500 Manufacturer" that aligns almost perfectly with Bloomberg's account of Coca-Cola's breach.
According to the study:
In 2009, a U.S. based Fortune 500 manufacturing company initiated discussions to acquire a Chinese corporation. During the negotiations, APT [advanced persistent threat] attackers compromised computers belonging to the executives of the U.S.-based company, most likely in an effort to learn more details of the negotiations. Sensitive data left the company on a weekly basis during negotiations, potentially providing the Chinese company with visibility to pricing and negotiation strategies.
As Bloomberg reported, Mandiant's study said the company gained knowledge of the breach only when law enforcement officials notified it of the intrusion. The study also details how hackers penetrated the company via a so-called spearphishing attack, in which the attackers sent e-mails to certain executives from a fake account ostensibly belonging to the chief executive.
According to Bloomberg, an e-mail containing the subject line: "Save power is save money! (from CEO)" was sent to the e-mail account of Bernhard Goepelt, Coca-Cola's current general counsel. The e-mail contained a malicious link that, once clicked, downloaded malware that gave the attackers full access to Coca-Cola's network.
Mandiant's 2010 report said the e-mail "was crafted to look like it originated from a fellow employee and discussed a message from the CEO on conserving resources."
Tal Be'ery, a senior Web researcher at Imperva, a data security firm, compared details of the Coca-Cola breach with Mandiant's study and said the two accounts clearly referred to the same company. Executives at Mandiant and media officers at Coca-Cola did not return requests for comment.
If Mandiant's study is, in fact, based on Coca-Cola, then it offers new insights into the breach. According to the study, once in, hackers used password-stealing software to gain access to other systems on the company's network. They also used the compromised executive's account to launch what is known as an SQL server attack, in which hackers exploit a software vulnerability and enter commands that cause databases to produce their contents.
But one of the most interesting aspects of the breach, according to Mandiant, was how well the attackers had concealed their tracks. According to Mandiant, hackers used so-called stub malware. This is an agile agent whose code can be tweaked by hackers to use it for various functions while leaving a small forensic footprint.
The one discrepancy between the Bloomberg and Mandiant accounts was why, ultimately, the company's acquisition fell apart. According to Bloomberg, Coca-Cola's takeover attempt of China Huiyuan Juice Group was thwarted because China's Ministry of Commerce rejected it for antitrust reasons. Mandiant's report offered a different take:
The intrusion had a significant impact on the victim organization. As a result of the compromise, the U.S. company terminated their acquisition plans. While it was not possible to determine all the data that had been lost, the victim company was not able to compete the acquisition and accomplish their business objectives.
 Updated: In an e-mail, Kent J. Landers, a spokesman for Coca-Cola, said that the company does not comment on security matters, but said Coca-Cola did not complete its acquisition of China Huiyuan Juice Group "as a result of the China Ministry of Commerce declining approval for the proposed transaction."

HIGHLIGHT: Switching sides in the battle that is holiday shopping. 

 BODY:
Is there anything more satisfying than complaining about the commercialization of Christmas? Could there be a better use of righteous indignation? Let us raise a chorus of voices against the traffic, which is like crawling into a pot of failed fudge, or the misguided dream of finding a parking place, which spawns a vigilant circling of the sixth floor of the garage. It felt so pushy all those years the store decorations went up the day after Thanksgiving, except that now they go up two weeks before Halloween. The carols jingle, flaying our last nerve, while we spend money we don't have to buy gifts they won't enjoy. In the process, we shave off just a little more of whatever sense of holiday wonder we ever possessed in the first place.
Bah. 
Then last year I experienced a Christmas conversion. I didn't find the true meaning of the season, not even close, but I did, for the first time in my life including childhood, tap into some real holiday joy. And I did it in the most unexpected place imaginable - a retail establishment. On Nov. 16, 2011, I opened a small, independent bookstore in Nashville called Parnassus Books with my business partner, Karen Hayes. It was the week before Thanksgiving. If I remember this correctly, and I'm sure I don't because I was wildly distracted, we weren't really thinking so much about Christmas then. We were thinking about the light fixtures and the staff schedule and if there was cash for the cash drawer. We had just decided on our hours of operation, and had yet to have those hours painted on the front door. We were thinking about opening a business.
But the tide of holiday shoppers could have cared less whether or not we were ready for them. They knew that books make thoughtful gifts, and once our doors were open they swept in like a flood.
All I can tell you is that when you're the one selling Christmas presents, the world looks a lot different than it does when you're the one buying them. Having spent so many years as a harried and unhappy holiday shopper, I simply assumed my misery was shared by the people on the other side of the checkout counter. In fact, I assumed it was worse for them, because while I might be out in the morass for a couple of hours, they had to stay in it for the entire day. But here's the big reveal: When you're the person pushing the merchandise, Christmas is a weird sort of fun.
"I'd take the Christmas season any day," Andy told me. Andy is a crackerjack bookseller at our store, a veteran of the now defunct Borders chain. "You walk in the door, you blink, and it's time to go home." Andy and I were going over the finer points of the season last week while taking turns hauling stacks of books up a sliding ladder to fill the overstock shelves. "Come Christmas, everybody wants a recommendation. They need a book for Uncle Harry. You hand them a book, they cross Harry off the list. Everybody's happy."
Meanwhile, Karen, who orders the books that fill the shelves, rarely made it out of her office that first season. She was pinned to her desk by the centripetal force of employees running in from the front of the store to tell her we need more copies of the new Stephen King, more! and then running out again to ring someone up.
Many months later, I would enjoy a conversation with a young woman who had never read F. Scott Fitzgerald. A friend told her she should read "The Beautiful and Damned." She was holding the book in her hand. Gently, firmly, I explained that she should read "The Great Gatsby" first, and if she liked it, "Tender Is the Night." I told her no one should start with "The Beautiful and Damned." But at Christmastime, conversations regarding the finer points of the Fitzgerald oeuvre do not exist. Our conversations about books were better suited for a fast-paced game show - "I need a book for a smart 11-year-old girl," a wild-eyed mother shouted over the din of the crowd. I didn't ask her if the child had read the Harry Potter books. I didn't waste her time like that. " 'The Apothecary,' Maile Meloy," I said, pitching the pretty hardback into her hands.
Parnassus is a small store, and there were enough people crammed inside that I was glad the fire marshal wasn't shopping there. We had to get the books to the people as fast as possible so they could rush on to the Container Store and Williams-Sonoma in the mall across the street. Maybe it's inevitable, but those of us at Parnassus found ourselves recommending the same books over and over again. Your husband likes nonfiction and business? Here's the Steve Jobs biography. Your dad likes history? Robert K. Massie, "Catherine the Great." Mystery? "Death Comes to Pemberley." Literary fiction? '"The Marriage Plot."
I bought the Steve Jobs for my stepdaughter's husband, but it turned out he already had it. When I brought it back the next morning, Andy was working the register. We made eye contact the second I came through the door. He raised his eyebrows and pointed discreetly at the book in my hands. I nodded. "Sir!" he said to a gentleman who was walking dejectedly away. "I was wrong. I see we have one copy left." I went straight to the gift wrap table and wrapped it up.
Give or take a couple of percentage points, most retail establishments expect to do 25 percent of their yearly business in the weeks between Thanksgiving and Christmas. So are they going to deck their halls a little bit early in hopes of extending the magic? You better believe it. I've never put up a Christmas tree in my life, but I was happy to clip a star to the top of the one in the bookstore. We tried to restrict the playing of carols to the Vince Guaraldi Trio, but after several days even those adorable Peanuts characters singing, "Hark! the Herald Angels Sing" began to chafe. We switched over to Elvis - "Blue Christmas."
And we had fun. Even though we kept running out of "The Hunger Games" (who didn't have "The Hunger Games" already?) and Laura Hillenbrand's "Unbroken," Andy was right: we blinked and the day was gone. I bought books for everybody I knew - gorgeous annotated copies of "Peter Pan" and coffee table books that ate up half a roll of wrapping paper. They were so beautiful that I couldn't resist them, and anyway, there was no time to shop anyplace else. I was filled with the Christmas spirit, or the spirit of holiday retail, and I started to think that they were one and the same.
As those of us at Parnassus brace for our second holiday season, we're all a little wiser. Karen has ordered extra copies of Jon Meacham's "Thomas Jefferson: The Art of Power," which we're expecting is going to be big, along with the new collection of Alice Munro stories, "Dear Life," because what good is having a bookstore if you can't push Alice Munro? This year, I highly recommend the abandonment of online shopping in favor of diving into the traffic. Shop local and support your neighbors! In these trying economic times, joy to the world and good will toward all may just need a little homemade stimulus package.
Ho, ho, ho.

HEADLINE: Ford Recalling 73,000 Escapes and 15,800 Fusions

BYLINE: CHRISTOPHER JENSEN


HIGHLIGHT: The automaker cites a fire hazard in its 1.6-liter EcoBoost four-cylinder engines. 

 BODY:
For the third time this year, Ford is recalling vehicles with its 1.6-liter EcoBoost four-cylinder engines, citing a fire hazard.
The action covers about 65,000 2013 Escapes and almost 15,000 2013 Ford Fusions in the United States, according to a document the automaker filed on Friday with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. 
About 8,000 more Escapes and 800 more Fusions are being recalled in Canada.
The 2013 Fusions and Escapes with the two-liter or 2.5-liter engines are not affected.
The automaker is aware of 13 fires, although there were no injuries, Said Deep, a Ford spokesman, said in a telephone interview.
In its report, Ford told the safety agency that it had been investigating reports of under-hood fires since early September and that it appeared an unidentified liquid was leaking when the engine overheated. If the liquid touches the exhaust system, a fire may result.
The report said Ford's investigators "found a pattern of engine overheating and fluid leaks that led to the fires." It did not identify the fluid.
Mr. Deep said he could not immediately identify the errant fluid.
It is not the first time the automaker has had problems with leaking fluid and fires with the 1.6-liter EcoBoost engine. In September, Ford recalled about 6,100 of its 2013 Escape crossovers, saying a coolant leak could cause fires.
It also is not clear how Ford plans to fix the vehicles. In its report to the safety administration, the automaker said it was "developing a fix to address the fire risk."
Ford said some owners had reported warnings on the instrument clusters reading "Engine power reduced to lower temps" or "Engine over temp." Some reported seeing a red light or hearing a chime.
Owners who see such warnings should find a safe place to pull over and stop the vehicle, the automaker advised.
Mr. Deep said owners were being urged to contact a dealer as soon as possible. He said they would be given loaner vehicles at no cost. Any damage caused by overheating will also be repaired without charge, Ford said.
Ford has heavily promoted the EcoBoost family of engines, which come in different sizes and are made in different locations. The 1.6-liter version is made in Spain.
What the engines share is turbocharging and direct injection. The goal is to provide good power and improved fuel economy.
In July, Ford recalled about 11,500 2013 Escape crossovers because a fuel line on the 1.6-liter EcoBoost could leak.
In that case, Ford took the unusual action of telling owners to stop driving the vehicles.
The new Fusion and Escape are two of the most important vehicles the automaker has introduced in years, vying in highly competitive segments with relatively high volumes.
Ford described the recall as voluntary, but once an automaker is aware of a safety problem, it has no choice but to contact the federal safety agency - within five business days - or face a civil penalty.

HEADLINE: 'Books, I Think, Are Dead': Joe Queenan Talks About 'One for the Books'

BYLINE: JOHN WILLIAMS


HIGHLIGHT: Mr. Queenan's new book recounts his lifetime of reading the great, the ridiculous and everything in between. 

 BODY:
Throughout his career, the humorist Joe Queenan has gleefully skewered pop culture, Baby Boomers, sports fans and much else. In his 2009 memoir "Closing Time," Mr. Queenan wrote about growing up poor in Philadelphia and suffering at the hands of his violent father. In his latest, "One for the Books," he recounts a lifetime of reading the classics, the trashy and everything in between. He also makes an impassioned case for the printed book's superiority over its digital competitor. In a recent e-mail interview, Mr. Queenan discussed the future of books, his problem with book clubs, reading 80 books at a time and more. Below are edited excerpts from the conversation:
 Q. 
You write that it's as if certain unread books are "stalking me,[#x2028] taunting me": "You're not fooling anybody, pally. If you haven't read 'Ulysses,' you're still a pathetic rube off the streets of Philadelphia. [#x2028]And you always will be." After a lifetime of serious reading, how deeply[#x2028] do you still feel conscious of not coming from a typical[#x2028] bookish background? 
 A. 
Not at all. I never think about it. The "Ulysses" stuff is just a joke. One thing, though: When I was a callow youth devouring books while mired in an unsatisfactory economic class, I thought this would stand me in good stead once I started hanging out with the bourgeoisie. I figured people would be really impressed that I had read "Silas Marner" and "Mourning Becomes Electra." Then I finally got invited into the Mansion on the Hill and discovered that the residents were all illiterate slobs.
 Q. 
One of your book's biggest themes is the superiority of books to[#x2028] e-readers. Are you optimistic about the future of books on paper? And do [#x2028]you consider this book more of an early eulogy or a rallying cry?
 A. 
The book is elegiac. Books, I think, are dead. You cannot fight the zeitgeist and you cannot fight corporations. The genius of corporations is that they force you to make decisions about how you will live your life and then beguile you into thinking that it was all your choice. Compact discs are not superior to vinyl. E-readers are not superior to books. Lite beer is not the great leap forward. A society that replaces seven-tier wedding cakes with lo-fat cupcakes is a society that deserves to be put to the sword. But you can't fight City Hall. I also believe that everything that happens to you as you grow older makes it easier to die, because the world you once lived in, and presumably loved, is gone. As I have said before, when Keith Richards goes, I'm going too. Same deal with books. 
 Q. 
You say you're reading up to 32 books at a time. What are the mechanics [#x2028]of that? Has the number of books you read simultaneously grown over time? [#x2028]Is there a ceiling, or could you be reading a hundred books at some[#x2028] point?
 A. 
I might read 50 pages of a Maigret novel, then switch to Flaubert, then switch to one of those beautiful little Taschen books about Courbet or Odilon Redon, then switch to Sherlock Holmes, then switch to John Keegan, then switch to "The English Patient." Last week I read Margot Livesey's gorgeous "The Flight of Gemma Hardy" in two days, then went back to the book about the Spanish Civil War that I have been working on for years. There is literally no limit to how many books you can read simultaneously, provided you have a good memory. I once got up to around 80. Now I have it back down to a manageable 24.
 Q. 
You cycle through different ways of organizing your books (by height, by[#x2028]author's nationality, by subject matter). Do you have a favorite method?
 A. 
No. The whole thing is a form of socially sanctioned insanity. It is a way of trying to control a universe that cannot be controlled.
 Q. 
You say that, "a genuinely terrible book is a sheer delight." What's the [#x2028]worst book you've ever read? (Let's exclude the most predictably bad,[#x2028] like those you cite written by O. J. Simpson and Geraldo Rivera.)
 A. 
"Atlas Shrugged" is moronic beyond belief, though it just narrowly edges out "The Fountainhead." Rand is a fascist and a creep, either of which could be forgiven. But she also cannot write. As Oscar Wilde once said, the only truly unforgivable crime is lack of sophistication. I think Wilde said that. He said everything else.
 Q. 
About a slightly different category, you write, "reading a bad book by a[#x2028] good writer is compelling in a way that reading a good book by a[#x2028] mediocrity never is." What's the worst book by a good writer that you've[#x2028] read?
 A. 
"The Old Man and the Sea" is pathetic, infantile, hokey, almost self-parody. Everything great in Hemingway had curdled into schtick. That said, I just finished re-reading "The Sun Also Rises" for the 15 billionth time.
 Q. 
Have your experiences in book clubs been universally terrible? How might [#x2028]you design an ideal book club, or do you think it's impossible?
 A. 
I was only in one book club a long, long time ago. It scarred me for life. People would talk about things like "foreshadowing." It was like being in high school. An ideal book club would consist exclusively of writers. Those guys know how to pick good books. They're in that line of trade. If I could be in a book club with Thomas McGuane, Jane Smiley, Julian Barnes and Jane Gardam, I'd sign up today.
 Q. 
You haven't shopped many times at the Strand bookstore in New York,[#x2028] which surprised me. As a place to browse and a place for older and odder [#x2028]titles, I find it invaluable. What keeps you away?
 A. 
No charm. I feel like I'm trapped in a Jose Saramago novel where a customer named Borges keeps turning up and asking for a copy of "Don Quixote." Too much of a good thing is a bad thing.
 Q. 
In itemizing your library, you say you own "perhaps 30 books I keep[#x2028] around as a joke." Do you buy these yourself or are they given to you as[#x2028] gag gifts? What makes a book a joke rather than just a bad book?
 A. 
They mostly turned up over the transom at jobs I used to work at. "Hoosier Home Remedies" is my favorite. That is the best title for a book ever. I am not saying that the book itself is a joke - the remedies are excellent - but I only keep it around for laughs. I have held on to "Steve Allen on the Bible, Religion, and Morality" because Steve Allen gave it to me, and because it holds out hope that I may one day be given "Jay Leno on the Bible, Religion, and Morality" or "Ellen on Leibniz." Of such dreams is a full life made.
Bad books are not so much funny as ridiculous. "1945" by Newt Gingrich and some industrious history professor is insanely bad. Still, if Gingrich had gotten himself elected president he wouldn't have had time to get these books co-written for him. The republic would have benefited greatly.
 Q. 
You've written a great deal about movies, often scathingly. Let's get[#x2028] sunny: do you have any favorite movies that were adapted from books?
 A. 
"L.A. Confidential" was a brilliant book and a brilliant movie. The same is true of "True Confessions." "The Sweet Hereafter" is a great book and a great movie. So is "Black Robe." "Brokeback Mountain" is a great movie based on a beautiful novella. You can say the same thing about "Emma," "Sense and Sensibility," "Great Expectations," the most recent "Jane Eyre" and several versions of "Pride and Prejudice." Not to mention "Ran." As for The Iliad, well, they haven't gotten that one right yet. Still can't figure out what to do with the gods. 
 Q. 
What's the next book you're planning to read?
 A. 
It took me 34 years to finish "Middlemarch." The first 31 years were the hardest. I started "Moby-Dick" about 20 years ago and never got past page 100. Captain Ahab, batter up. If I could get through "Middlemarch," I can get through anything.

HEADLINE: Obama Hits the Road to Rally Support for His Tax Plan

BYLINE: PETER BAKER and JONATHAN WEISMAN


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama made a campaign-style foray on Friday to a toy factory in this Philadelphia suburb to rally the public behind his plan to increase taxes on the wealthy. 

 BODY:
 1:45 p.m. | Updated HATFIELD, Pa. - President Obama made a campaign-style foray on Friday to a toy factory in this Philadelphia suburb to rally the public behind his plan to increase taxes on the wealthy while casting Republicans in Congress as modern-day Scrooges.
"I've been keeping my own naughty and nice list for Washington," he told workers and others gathered at a plant that makes K'NEX toys. If Republicans hold middle-class tax cuts hostage to preserve them for the rich, he said, then everyone could end up paying more next year. "That's sort of like the lump of coal you get for Christmas. That's a Scrooge Christmas." 
Mr. Obama's trip here was his first return to the road during a high-stakes effort to outflank his opponents on Capitol Hill in the looming crisis over the nation's finances. Rather than just sit down and negotiate with Congressional leaders, as he tried in the past to his disappointment, the president is pursuing a dual-track strategy that involves concentrating as much public pressure on lawmakers as possible even as his aides make the rounds on Capitol Hill.
So far, Mr. Obama has largely stuck to his past positions, gambling that the 51 percent of the popular vote he won in this month's election constitutes a mandate that will force Republicans to back down. While he repeated here on Friday that he was willing to compromise, the proposals his advisers laid out to Congressional leaders on Thursday reflected an opening bid in a four-week negotiation with little new compromise so far.
Among other things, the president's advisers told Congressional leaders that he wanted $1.6 trillion more in tax revenues over the next 10 years, $50 billion in short-term stimulus spending to bolster the economy and an end to Congressional control over statutory borrowing limits. In exchange, he agreed to $400 billion in savings from Medicare and other entitlements over 10 years, to be worked out next year with no guarantees.
House Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio, responding to President Obama's appearance, told reporters talks to avert a fiscal crisis in January are at an impasse.
"There's a stalemate. Let's not kid ourselves," he said. I'm not trying to make this more difficult. If you've watched me in the last three weeks I have been very guarded in what I have to say. I don't want to make it harder for me or the president or members of both parties to be able to find common ground."
"Right now, we're almost nowhere," he concluded.
Mr. Boehner also declared Mr. Obama's plan unacceptable. But he did not offer a counterproposal. Instead, he decried what he called a lack of seriousness and leadership on the part of the president.
"Republicans are not seeking to impose our will on the president. We are seeking a bipartisan solution that can pass both houses of Congress and can be signed into law by the president in the coming days," he said.
He also dug in against tax rate increases Mr. Obama is demanding.
"Increasing tax rates draws money away from our economy that needs to be invested in our economy to put the American people back to work. It's the wrong approach," he said.
If Mr. Obama and Congress do not reach agreement, then taxes will rise and spending will fall automatically at the end of the year. Mr. Obama, however, has focused his message almost entirely on taxes, narrowing the debate to the question of whether the Bush-era tax cuts should be extended for household income over $250,000 a year.
He called again on Congress to go ahead and extend the cuts now for income under that level. "The reason I'm here is because I want the American people to urge Congress soon in the next week the next two weeks to begin the work we have by doing what we all agree on," he said. "Both parties agree we should extend the middle-class tax cuts."
Doing so would in effect end the debate over extending tax cuts for higher income since Congress presumably would not pass such a bill separately and even if it did Mr. Obama would veto it.
The president tried to enlist supporters to engage in the fight directly. "I want you to call, I want you to send e-mail, post on your Facebook wall," he said.
He spoke after touring a Rodon Group factory here that makes K'NEX Brands construction toys like Tinkertoy, Ninetendo and Angry Bird building sets. About 150 people work at the factory and the White House said Rodon brought back 95 percent of their packaging and promotion from China to Pennsylvania in recent years.
The trip here culminated a week in which the White House released a report warning that consumer demand would fall if middle-class tax cuts are not renewed, gathered ostensibly typical taxpayers to stand behind the president during a speech and organized meetings between Mr. Obama and small-business owners and corporate leaders.

HEADLINE: The 'Go Fast' and 'Go Big' Fiscal Challenges

BYLINE: LAURA D'ANDREA TYSON


HIGHLIGHT: Spending cuts and tax increases will help with the federal deficit, but government investment to foster long-term growth should be a core principle of deficit reduction, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Laura D'Andrea Tyson is a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, and served as chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Clinton. 
Washington faces two urgent fiscal challenges in the next few months. Before the end of the year, the lame duck Congress, the most polarized in recent history, must negotiate an agreement with President Obama to protect the still fragile economic recovery from the so-called fiscal cliff - the $600 billion in spending cuts and tax increases scheduled to begin to take effect on Jan. 1. Then, early next year, a newly elected but still divided Congress must approve an increase in the federal debt limit. Failure to do so in a timely way would damage confidence, posing yet another threat to the economy's continued healing.
These two challenges are manifestations of the long-running fiscal challenge confronting the country: the fact that the federal debt is rising at an unsustainable rate. That's why a political deal to address the fiscal cliff and the debt limit in the near term should be linked to a credible framework to put fiscal policy on a sustainable path in the long term. 
By the end of this year, policy makers need to "go fast" to address the fiscal cliff and debt limit and to "go big" to establish the broad outlines of a significant multiyear deficit-reduction plan. 
The economy continues to operate far below its capacity. The unemployment rate is at least two percentage points higher than what most economists consider consistent with a full recovery. Other measures, such as the high rate of long-term unemployment and the low labor-force participation rate, reflect an impaired labor market.

According to the Congressional Budget Office, gross domestic product is still about 6 percent, or about $973 billion, below the potential level the economy is capable of producing at full capacity. This is the largest gap between actual and potential output following a recession in modern American history. 
The weakness of government spending at the state and local level and more recently at the federal level has been a significant factor behind the slow recovery. The phasing out of earlier federal stimulus measures, the expiration of temporary payroll-tax relief and extended unemployment benefits scheduled at the end of the year, and the tight caps on discretionary federal spending already in force mean more federal fiscal drag on the economy's growth next year even if the fiscal cliff is averted. 
Ideally, given the shortfall in aggregate demand that is keeping the economy stuck below potential, a deal on the cliff should include an extension of both payroll tax relief and unemployment benefits, as well as other temporary policies to support job creation, such as the employment tax credit for small business and the increase in infrastructure spending proposed last year by President Obama as part of the American Jobs Act. 
Alas, it seems unlikely that a deal will contain these measures. At best, if a deal is reached it will probably be limited to tabling the deep spending cuts automatically scheduled to take effect early next year, extending the 2001-3 tax cuts for the bottom 98 percent of taxpayers and raising taxes on the top 2 percent of taxpayers, especially those with incomes over $1 million, through some combination of higher marginal tax rates and caps on deductions. 
To improve the economy's near-term growth prospects, the deal should also contain a promise that Congress will approve the debt limit when necessary without a destabilizing delay. 
So far, negotiations about a go-big framework for deficit reduction have focused on cutting at least $4 trillion from the federal budget over the next decade, with the goal of stabilizing and then reducing the debt-to-G.D.P. ratio. The election and recent Gallup polls settled the debate about whether an increase in revenues will be part of the plan. The answer is yes. 
The debate has shifted to how revenues should be increased and who should bear the burden. The proposition that revenues should be raised through tax changes that limit deductions, credits and loopholes, in lieu of or in addition to rate increases, is gaining momentum. 
Economists believe that raising revenues for deficit reduction through base-broadening tax reforms is probably better for economic growth than raising marginal tax rates. 
Although it may prove politically necessary for a bipartisan deal, however, there is no convincing economic justification for using some of the revenues saved from tax reforms to lower marginal income tax rates for high-income taxpayers. These rates are already at historic lows. 
And there is no convincing evidence that real economic activity responds materially to changes in these rates, at least within the range of rates experienced in the United States during the last half-century. The tax code should be reformed to make it simpler, fairer and less distortionary and to raise revenues for deficit reduction, not to reduce tax rates on high-income taxpayers.
Over the last 30 years, income inequality in the United States has increased sharply. During the same period, the federal tax system has become less progressive and has contributed to the trend of rising income inequality and widening opportunity gaps between children born into different income groups. 
A more progressive tax code, achieved through some combination of higher tax rates and capping deductions for high-income taxpayers, would be a powerful tool both to counteract these trends and to achieve long-term fiscal sustainability.
On the spending side, "go big" bipartisan proposals for deficit reduction, such as the Simpson-Bowles and Domenici-Rivlin plans, focus on curbing the growth of Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. This is understandable as these programs already account for about 40 percent of federal spending and that share is projected to rise as a result of the aging of the population and the growth of health care costs. 
But lumping Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security together is misleading and, given strong partisan passions on Social Security, could weaken the chances of reaching a bipartisan deal on deficit reduction. 
Spending on Social Security is rising primarily because of demographics, not because of growing benefits per eligible person. Indeed, the Social Security Trust Fund has adequate resources to cover benefits until at least 2033, and the program's revenue shortfall is less than 1 percent of G.D.P. over the next 75 years. 
In contrast, the argument for including Medicare and Medicaid in a framework for long-run deficit containment is compelling. The single most important factor behind the projected growth in federal spending is the growth in health care spending, driven primarily by the growth in Medicare spending per beneficiary. 
The outlook has already improved as a result of significant changes in the delivery and payment of health care services in the Affordable Care Act. As a result of these changes, growth in Medicare spending per enrollee is projected to slow to 3.1 percent a year during the next decade, about the same as the annual growth of nominal G.D.P. per capita and about two percentage points slower than the annual growth of private insurance premiums per beneficiary. 
Speeding up the pace of the Affordable Care Act changes along with others, such as reducing subsidies for high-income beneficiaries and drug benefits and introducing small co-pays on home health-care services, would mean even larger Medicare savings. 
A "structural reform" popular among Republican deficit hawks like Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin to convert Medicare to a premium-support or voucher system would be counterproductive and would drive up both spending per beneficiary and overall costs in the health care system. 
The goal of a "go big" plan for deficit reduction should be to ensure the economy's long-term growth and competitiveness. Yet the debate over spending in Washington is fixated on cutting entitlement spending. Very little is heard about the need to increase federal spending in education and training, research and development and infrastructure, three areas with proven track records in rate of return, job creation, opportunity and growth. 
Spending in these areas accounts for less than 10 percent of the federal budget; this share has been declining for several decades and is slated to fall to dangerous new lows as a result of the caps on nonmilitary discretionary spending already in place. 
A pro-growth framework for deficit reduction must reverse these trends. More government investment in the foundations of economic growth should be recognized as a core principle of deficit reduction.

HEADLINE: SAC Chief Gave Testimony

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: In testimony given to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the hedge fund manager Steven A. Cohen shed some light on questionable stock trades. | A cyclical downdraft in the clean energy sector has not discouraged one prominent investor, Vinod Khosla, from committing more money to his bets. | The United States Chamber of Commerce is trying to retain its influence as another group, the Campaign to Fix the Debt, raises its profile. | The directors of Orient-Express Hotels are in an unusually secure position. 

 BODY:
SAC CHIEF'S TESTIMONY | The hedge fund manager Steven A. Cohen has offered little public explanation of the stock trades that are the focus of an intensifying government investigation. But Mr. Cohen, the head of SAC Capital Advisors, gave testimony to the Securities and Exchange Commission on the matter, which involves allegations of insider trading by a former portfolio manager.
Mr. Cohen said that his hedge fund sold the stocks in question after a portfolio manager said he was "no longer comfortable" with the position, The Financial Times reports, citing unidentified people familiar with the testimony. Any details of the conversation between Mr. Cohen and the manager, Mathew Martoma, are likely to feature prominently in the coming court action. The criminal case against Mr. Martoma is the first time the government has linked Mr. Cohen to questionable trades. The hedge fund was also warned by the S.E.C. that it might be the target of a civil fraud lawsuit. 
The firm held a call with employees on Thursday after the market closed, reassuring them that Mr. Cohen had no plans to retire, CNBC's Kate Kelly reported. That followed a conference call with investors on Wednesday, in which executives tried to allay concerns. Six former employees of SAC have now been linked to insider trading by the government, and three have been convicted. Still, investors stuck with the firm, adding as much as $1.6 billion in new capital to the flagship funds between 2010 and 2011, according to Absolute Return.
KHOSLA KEEPS A BULLISH BET ON CLEAN TECH | A cyclical downdraft in the clean energy sector has not discouraged one prominent investor, Vinod Khosla, from committing more money to his bets, Randall Smith reports for DealBook. Mr. Khosla, the founder of Khosla Ventures, once controlled stakes worth as much as $1.3 billion in biofuel companies, but at least on paper, that value has dwindled to roughly $378 million, Mr. Smith reports. To one of his supporters, Andy Bechtolsheim, who co-founded Sun Microsystems with Mr. Khosla 30 years ago, Mr. Khosla is "a visionary who likes to make big bets on ideas that can really change the world." Still, as Pavel Molchanov, an analyst at Raymond James & Associates, notes, "The whole clean tech sector has been out of favor." Mr. Smith writes: "Despite the crosscurrents, Mr. Khosla seems unwavering in his commitment."
ON THE AGENDA | Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, and Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, join the finance ministers of Italy and France at a conference in Paris. Michael Milken, chairman of the Milken Institute, is on Bloomberg TV at 1:30 p.m. Gene Sperling, director of President Obama's National Economic Council, is on Bloomberg TV at 9 p.m. Data on personal income and outlays for October is released at 8:30 a.m.
 RIFTS IN THE BUSINESS LOBBY | The United States Chamber of Commerce, the powerful industry group, is trying to retain its "influence and swagger" after a string of political losses, and as another group, the Campaign to Fix the Debt, raises its profile, The New York Times reports. As President Obama and Congress negotiate over the "fiscal cliff," the Chamber of Commerce is pushing for a deal without tax increases, while some prominent chief executives are acknowledging that taxes might have to be raised. "Many business leaders are looking to the chamber as a bulwark against the White House's push for higher taxes, but it is unclear if the century-old association has the clout it once did," The Times writes.
For the business leaders who comprise Fix the Debt, the group offers more than access to political power. It's also an extended networking session, an "elite hobnobber's paradise," New York magazine's Kevin Roose reports, quoting one unidentified member as saying, "We have these great dinners."
WHEN DIRECTORS ELECT THEMSELVES | As Orient-Express Hotels considers an unsolicited takeover offer from the Indian Hotels Company, a subsidiary of the Tata Group, its board of directors is in a strong position, Steven M. Davidoff writes in the Deal Professor column. That's because the directors can elect themselves, "a unique characteristic among companies worldwide. Shareholders have no real say in the selection of Orient-Express's directors." Mr. Davidoff explains: "Orient-Express's shares are divided into Class A and Class B shares, with the Class B shares controlling 64 percent of the votes. Who owns the Class B shares? It is actually Orient-Express itself." This feature of Orient-Express, which is based in Bermuda, "wouldn't be allowed under Delaware law," Mr. Davidoff says. "This wouldn't be so bad, except Orient-Express has a history of poor performance."

HEADLINE: A Test For Liberalism

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: The quest to raise taxes isn't a threat to Obama's second-term agenda. It is his second-term agenda. 

 BODY:
Here's National Journal's Major Garrett, explaining why the Obama White House, for all its shows of intransigence this week, ultimately wants and needs a fiscal deal:
President Obama, though reelected, has no hope of a second-term legacy of immigration reform, tax reform, or climate-change legislation (if he even wants it) if he drives the nation off the cliff.
No one will follow Obama back out of the recessionary wilderness-where even liberals who might cheer him for "protecting" Medicare and Medicaid (the centerpiece of GOP entitlement demands-Social Security reforms are just a bargaining chip) will find a bone-chilling political gloom. After all, you can't sustain entitlements in a country where middle incomes continue to fall, jobs grow more scarce, and tax collections continue at their current anemic pace. 
Obviously the President doesn't want a double-dip recession. But when it comes to his second-term legacy, I'm not sure anyone in the White House is privileging the possibly-illusory hope of a major immigration reform compromise and the almost-certainly-illusory dream of a major cap-and-trade bill over what they're trying to win on taxes in the here and now. And if so, they shouldn't be! The reality is that it has proven very, very difficult over the last twenty-odd years for the Democrats to muster the votes, the willpower or the political cover to raise taxes. Yet for the edifice of the liberal welfare state to endure in anything like its current form - the president's health care law very much included - taxes need to rise, and rise, and then probably rise some more. "We're not collecting the revenue we need to support the spending we want," the left-leaning economist Jared Bernstein says in today's Times story on taxation trends, and that has to be liberalism's rallying cry for the foreseeable future, or else the government they want cannot be sustained.
In this context, the White House's quest to extract as much tax revenue as possible from the current negotiations looks less like an impediment to the rest of the president's second term ambitions, and more like the sine qua non of his agenda as a whole - because without more tax revenue nothing else about the Obama program makes much sense. If a Democratic president cannot get a substantial tax increase (or has to make major, Paul Ryan-esque concessions on entitlement spending in exchange) in a situation where he's just won re-election and taxes are scheduled to go up by multiples of what he's asking for if nobody does anything - well, then the liberal future looks a lot less bright than it did the morning after the presidential election. That's what at stake here, ultimately. Obama needs to prove that his party's model of governance is actually sustainable, a better opportunity than this one is unlikely to come around, and to sacrifice that opportunity on the altar of, say, a hypothetical climate-change breakthrough two years from now would be political malpractice.
I would also offer a caveat to Garrett's point about the political unsustainability of entitlements in a weak economy. Yes, in the long term, slow economic growth and its consequences will further undercut the basic foundation of the welfare state. But that's a post-Obama problem for Democrats, not an immediate political dilemma. In the shorter term, political support for existing safety-net programs only tends to strengthen in hard times. Yes, new programs are regarded with suspicion, as the Democrats learned to their political cost in the Obamacare debate. But the president now has his health care law in place, he doesn't have any big new expansions of government on the agenda, and it's exceedingly unlikely that a limping economy in 2013 or 2014 would suddenly force concessions on Medicare and Social Security that liberals aren't prepared to make today.
Again, none of this means that Obama doesn't care about the economic consequences of cliff jumping, or that the administration won't eventually make some sacrifices to make a pre-January deal. But it's important not to minimize how important it is to the White House to come out of these negotiations a clear winner, and thus how much brinksmanship Obama might be willing to practice in order to exploit the unique set of advantages this moment affords to his party and his cause.

HEADLINE: A Note on the 'Reagan '80s'

BYLINE: BINYAMIN APPELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: Most Americans in 2010 paid far less in total taxes than they would have 30 years earlier, but how much of the decline happened during or after the Reagan presidency depends on the income group. 

 BODY:
Some readers of The New York Times - the version printed on trees - have noted that a headline on the front page of Friday's paper emphasizes a different aspect of our analysis of tax trends than the accompanying chart. The headline says, "Complaints Aside, Most Face Lower Tax Burden Than in the Reagan '80s," while the chart compares tax rates in 1980 and 2010. And as Greg Mankiw notes, President Ronald Reagan took office in 1981. 
Both headline and chart are accurate, but there is an interesting difference.
We focused on a comparison with 1980 to capture the full extent of the changes since Reagan opened an era of cuts in federal taxation. As the article says: 
Most Americans in 2010 paid far less in total taxes - federal, state and local - than they would have paid 30 years ago. According to an analysis by The New York Times, the combination of all income taxes, sales taxes and property taxes took a smaller share of their income than it took from households with the same inflation-adjusted income in 1980.
It is also true - and important -- that reductions in federal taxation continued after Reagan left office. Indeed, those cuts have been large enough to outpace increases in state and local taxation. As the article also says, "Tax rates at most income levels were lower in 2010 than at any point during the 1980s." 
The difference between the two time frames is that while upper-income households have seen the largest percentage decline in the overall period since 1980, the rest of the population has seen the largest percentage declines in the years since Reagan's presidency.
You can see these trends by income group, and year by year, in our interactive graphic.
For households making less than $25,000, taxes increased during the 1980s, then declined starting in the mid-1990s as both parties backed the expansion of government payments like the earned income tax credit.
Middle-income households did get a tax cut in 1981, but its value was steadily eroded by rising state and local taxes. Their taxes also began a fresh decline in the mid-1990s that continued unabated through 2010.
Upper-income households got the largest cuts in the 1980s, the largest increases in the 1990s, and the largest cuts in the 2000s. 
There's an important caveat to the front-page headline: For many upper-income households, average tax rates in 2010 were higher than at the '80s nadir -- particularly the top income bracket, which includes 1 percent of households.
But average tax rates increased sharply for upper-income households in recent years not because of changes in tax policy but because a smaller share of earnings for those households came from investments, which are taxed at lower rates. 
In 2007, before the recession, most upper-income households also paid a smaller share of income in taxes than comparable households during the "Reagan '80s."

HEADLINE: Our Brussels Correspondents Answer Readers' Questions About the Euro, Europe and the Union

BYLINE: JAMES KANTER and ANDREW HIGGINS


HIGHLIGHT: Record unemployment in the euro zone. Significant gains for Britain's most anti-Europe political party. And E.U. leaders unable to agree on a budget. But Germany approves the latest Greek bailout. Where is Europe, the euro and the E.U. headed? James Kanter and Andrew Higgins explain. 

 BODY:
 The news this week from besieged Europe was - relatively - good, sort of. Yields on Italian government bonds - the amount Italy has to pay investors to assume a piece of their debt - fell to the lowest levels in more than a year. The German Parliament, the Bundestag, approved Germany's latest contribution to bailout-broke Greece. And though unemployment in the euro zone reached record heights, the head of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, predicted that the euro zone's economy would begin to recover in the latter part of next year. 
But how long will it last? We have been here before, a lot. The market decides things are O.K. for the moment, before souring on Europe again. The spectacle of European leaders failing to agree on the outlines of a European Union budget came only last week - and that specter will rear its head again next year when those same leaders have to fashion a budget, and Greece will have to stay afloat, and Spain, Italy and Portugal will have to continue implementing structural reforms, and France may face a reckoning of its own, and Britain....Well, you understand. 
We recently asked readers for their questions about the future of the European experiment. To bring some long-term clarity to all the short-term clutter, our Brussels correspondents, James Kanter and Andrew Higgins, have supplied the answers.
Judy W. from Cumberland, Maryland, asked, "Do you think the U.K. will end up leaving the E.U. and would be in their best interest to leave?"
Well, Judy, opinion polls in Britain certainly suggest that hostility to the E.U. is mounting and nobody has ever lost votes in the United Kingdom by campaigning against Brussels. In fact, our colleague Stephen Castle reports today that the UK Independence Party, "the party that wants Britain to quit the European Union, made spectacular gains in three by-elections held Thursday, increasing pressure on the Conservative Prime Minister, David Cameron, to take a tough line on Europe." 
But saying and doing are two different things. And should a referendum on Britain's membership in the European Union be held, I doubt a majority would vote to actually pull out altogether. Britain would gain a financial windfall by leaving as it would no longer have to make annual contributions to the E.U. budget, but it would likely pay a very heavy economic price if it separates itself from the "single European market." Potential losses will, I suspect, tilt opinion away from the exit, no matter how suspicious many Britons are of the "European project." And, if a British withdrawal ever became an imminent possibility, the influential banking lobby in the City of London would pull out all the stops to try and make sure this doesn't happen. It would want to make sure Britain is not absent from a decision-making process in Brussels that has a direct impact on global banking. Having financiers and hedge fund managers on its side will not endear the E.U. to the general public but would help mobilize money for a referendum campaign. (Andrew Higgins)
Abo in Paris and Judy W. got into a mini-debate over what countries contribute how much to Europe and how much they get back, leading to the question, "Does it make sense for countries to look at what they 'put in' and what they 'get out' as far as subsidies and benefits?" 
The question goes to the heart of why the European Union summit meeting aimed at agreeing to a seven-year budget for the Union collapsed last week. Net contributor countries like Britain, Germany and Sweden were at loggerheads with net recipient countries like Poland, Lithuania and Spain over the size of the budget - about (EURO)1 trillion between 2014 and 2020, or $1.3 trillion. Britain was fighting hard to maintain an annual rebate that was worth about (EURO)3.5 billion last year. Denmark was demanding a rebate, too. But that kind of haggling is mostly pointless, according to the European Commission, the Union's policy-making arm. 
The commission says none of what countries "put in" and "get out" truly reflects the advantages of being part of a single market of 500 million people. As an example, the commission says the benefits of E.U. membership to the British economy are many times higher than its annual net contribution of around (EURO)7 billion (after subtracting the rebate and after subtracting the money from the E.U. budget spent in Britain in 2011). The commission also says there are many hidden benefits to membership such as common rules on health, environment and consumer protection. Of course, the commission has a dog in this fight: Its refusal to trim its costs, including generous salaries and pensions, earned it a rebuke last week from the British prime minister, David Cameron, who said its officials continue to "exist as if in a parallel universe."

A popular question among readers - and markets - continues to be, "Wouldn't the E.U. be better off if Greek were made to leave the euro?" A related question we received was: "Why doesn't the E.U. draw up sensible plans for a country to leave the euro?"
To the second question, Prime Minister Mark Rutte of the Netherlands suggested today that a country should indeed be able to leave the euro and stay in the European Union. 
Most observers assume that plans for Greece to leave the euro zone have been drawn up. But there are a host of reasons why such a plan hasn't been put into effect. One is that the euro project is as much political as economic. For many European policy makers, it's anathema that a country that is part of a flagship project for ever closer Union like the single currency could be shown the door. There also are fears that removing Greece from the euro area would actually do very little to solve some of the problems underlying the single currency. Once Greece went, market speculators could drive up the bond spreads of other countries like Portugal and Italy with economies that are a lot weaker than those of countries like Germany, which could still force the euro zone to unravel. (J.K.) 
Judy W. also asked, "With the current impasse over the budget, is there any thought given to stopping E.U. enlargement since so many of the new countries are in need of large subsidies? Do you think Turkey will ever be admitted to the E.U. or will its candidacy just fade away?" 
Turkish accession has been moving at a snail's pace since formal negotiations began with the government in Ankara seven years ago. Currently the process is in a deep freeze partly because Cyprus holds the rotating E.U. presidency and wants a solution to the Turkish occupation of the northern third of the island. Yet Turkey, too, is looking beyond the European Union as its economy booms.
That's all the more understandable when you recall that Turkey first applied to become a member in 1987. Rather than Turkey, the countries most likely to be next are from the Western Balkans. Croatia already is set to join in mid-2013. Brussels officials say that refusing membership for candidates like Serbia would be foolish because that would add to the risks of instability in the region. Containing violence there could be costlier than Serbian membership. 
One of the biggest concerns about enlargement is whether newer members from Eastern and Central Europe are sticking by the rules on pluralism, human rights and openness. Cases of corruption in Bulgaria and suggestions of an authoritarian drift in Hungary may be factors dampening the appetite for enlargement more than the costs of welcoming additional countries with lower levels of economic development.
