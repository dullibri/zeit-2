 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "The Court Usurps Congressional Power" (editorial, Feb. 22), about the Supreme Court's decision to limit the reach of the Americans With Disabilities Act: 
 The court indeed stripped a vulnerable minority of Americans of important protections against job discrimination. 
As you suggest, the court is also arrogantly substituting its 5-to-4 will for that of a clear Congressional majority on an issue as basic as equal protection under the law. In addition, the court is supporting the status quo of a 70-plus percent jobless rate for people with disabilities.
Fact: Job discrimination is illegal. Fact: People with disabilities have for too long been excluded from the economic mainstream because of such illegalities.
Why is the Supreme Court protecting lawbreakers instead of the victims of the lawbreaking? Do we have a government for the people or a government for the government?

HEADLINE: China's Latest Opening Of Market Hits a Snag 

BYLINE:  By CRAIG S. SMITH 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, Feb. 28 

 BODY:
Thousands of Chinese investors jammed brokerage houses today in hopes of buying shares on the newly liberalized hard currency stock market. But most people came away disappointed because there were not enough shares to go around.
 "My son gave me $27,000 to invest, but I was only able to invest $7,000," a 64-year-old woman said, as a crowd behind her argued with helpless brokerage clerks. "Today, you just can't buy in." 
 After Beijing announced last week that citizens would be allowed to buy Class B shares -- stocks denominated in Hong Kong and United States dollars and previously reserved for foreign investors -- money poured into the country through wire transfers to residents from friends and relatives abroad. 
Long, woolly lines formed on the streets as people waited in the cold to open trading accounts. Black market rates for the dollar shot higher. And would-be investors arrived with cash from Hong Kong and Taiwan to be ready when trading in the shares, halted more than a week ago, resumed today.
When the markets opened, buyers hugely outnumbered sellers and more than three-quarters of the stocks quickly jumped their daily 10 percent limit, many on the turnover of a single share. B share trading volume in Shanghai totaled only $750,000 by the end of the day, compared with $15 million to $20 million on a normal day.
It was yet another twist in the helter-skelter development of China's capital markets, which the government established as a cautious experiment more than 10 years ago and which have since fattened into one of the biggest share-trading systems in Asia. China now has more individual stockholders than any other country besides the United States and the total market value of its publicly listed shares exceeds $500 billion.
Almost none of those investors buy for the long term and few spend much time studying the companies involved, partly because the information available is sketchy at best. Instead, the markets move largely on rumors and second-guesses. There are periodic government investigations of stock price manipulation, and one sweeping cleanup is under way.
The result has been the building of what some analysts regard as a dangerous market bubble. The Class A market, denominated in Chinese yuan, has risen for years even though many of the companies listed there are low quality by international standards. Now, the government-orchestrated rally in Class B shares threatens to create a similar bubble.
"At some point these people are going to start selling, and then there's potential for carnage," said Peter Alexander, chief representative for Nationwide Mutual Insurance and a longtime Chinese stock market watcher.
Only about 5 percent of China's listed stocks are B shares, which were created in 1991 to give foreigners a chance to invest directly in Chinese companies and to give Chinese companies a way to raise capital. The B share market, denominated in Hong Kong dollars in Shenzhen and in United States dollars in Shanghai, never really got off the ground because there were too few shares traded to attract big Western investors. Chinese companies in search of foreign investors turned instead to Hong Kong and other markets overseas.
The thinly traded B share market, meanwhile, became one of the most volatile markets in the world. Last year, the Shanghai B share market surged 135 percent and the Shenzhen B share market rose 63 percent, but both had been slumping this year. Today, the Shanghai B share index surged 9.88 percent, to 91.42, the highest since May 1997, while the Shenzhen B share index gained 9.69 percent, to 140.09, its highest in over four years.
With China's entry to the World Trade Organization looming, regulators have begun looking for ways to make the market more liquid to compete with offshore markets when China's financial system barriers begin to fall.
China is expected to merge the B share market into the larger yuan-denominated A share market eventually, but that will have to wait until the country's currency is more freely convertible -- something that is not expected to happen for several years.
Throwing the B share market open was an interim solution. The Chinese hold about $75 billion in foreign exchange savings accounts and domestic companies hold another $55 billion in bank deposits. Even a fraction of that cash would increase liquidity in the 114 Class B stocks.
There is no shortage of eager investors. "It's meaningless to leave money in the bank, the interest rate is too low," said Tong Jialu, a 65-year-old doctor of traditional Chinese medicine who visited a basement Shanghai brokerage firm office in faded blue jeans and a gray flannel jacket. "Buying stocks is better than saving."
The trouble is getting the money into the market through the narrow window that the 10 percent limit on daily price movements allows. Until the rules changed, investors needed to show a foreign passport and have at least $10,000 deposited in a trading account to buy B shares. Now local Chinese can open a trading account with a minimum of $1,000 and a domestic identification card. By late Tuesday, more than 134,000 new B share trading accounts had been opened in Shanghai alone, nearly doubling the number of accounts registered there.
But with such obvious demand, few shareholders of Class B stock are willing to part with their shares until prices are much higher.
Trading in the Inner Mongolia Erdos Cashmere Company, the country's biggest producer of fine goat's wool, for example, opened at 55.7 United States cents a share, up 10 percent from its previous close and at a 12-month high, but only one share was sold. No one was willing to sell more to satisfy orders for more than 55 million shares. Most of the market's stocks are expected to jump their daily limit on little volume for several days.
The newly liquid markets could prove a boon to cash-hungry Chinese companies that have been prevented from selling stock on the yuan-denominated market, where listings are controlled by Beijing. Those controls are relaxing but have already been relaxed in the B share market. Private companies, in particular, can compete freely for capital by selling B shares. The A share market continues to favor state-owned companies.

HEADLINE: El Museo, Cramped, Seeks to Move Nearby 

BYLINE:  By CELESTINE BOHLEN 

 BODY:
El Museo del Barrio, a center of Latino art and culture housed in a former orphanage on Fifth Avenue and 104th Street in East Harlem, has approached city officials about moving down the avenue into the stately home of the Museum of the City of New York.
 Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced a plan in January to move the Museum of the City of New York from 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, its home since 1930, to the old Tweed Courthouse, being renovated on Chambers Street behind City Hall. That relocation has faced strong opposition in East Harlem, but a spokeswoman for the City Council said it was unclear whether the Council has the jurisdiction to stop the plan. 
 The mayor's announcement provided the opportunity for El Museo to propose moving to a building that would give it 10 times the space that it has now in its 6,721 square feet of galleries. Museum officials say they need the room to accommodate an expanding collection and to serve New York's fast-growing Latino population. 
"The museum has gone through tremendous growth recently, but the potential for more growth is being impeded by the building we are in," said Tony Bechara, chairman of the board of El Museo.
El Museo is one of several organizations interested in the neo-Georgian building, which has 65,000 square feet of exhibition space. Among them is the Museum of African Art in SoHo, which according to a museum spokeswoman would be interested in moving into the city museum's space while it awaits completion of its new building at Fifth Avenue and 110th Street. 
The city has not begun reviewing applications for tenants interested in the city museum building. The city's Economic Development Corporation will handle applications for the city-owned building, which is expected to be vacated by the Museum of the City of New York sometime in 2003.
"We know that the potential is there for a great Latin American institution, something on the level of the Jewish Museum, the Asia Society," said Mr. Bechara. "There is a population that is becoming more mature in its desire for cultural space, and more capable of the philanthropy that something like this would entail."
"It is a very interesting convergence of things," said Susana Torruella Leval, the director of El Museo, "where one of the oldest of the city's museums would be replaced by one of the youngest. It would be an interesting symbol of how the city, and the country, have changed."
El Museo owns about 7,000 objects, including Mexican masks, textiles from Chile, and Puerto Rican photographs and traditional art. Last year it opened a permanent exhibition dedicated to the pre-Columbian culture of the Taino, a Caribbean people, which includes several important pieces on loan from the Smithsonian Institution and the American Museum of Natural History. 
Major benefactors -- including artists and collectors -- have held back gifts in recent years, El Museo officials said, because the institution lacks space, a problem that museum officials said the new location would rectify. Museum officials said they had no estimates on the cost of renovating the city museum to suit their needs but that they were confident the move would generate support from donors and benefactors. 
Extra space, the officials said, would also help El Museo carry out its twin missions of serving its largely Puerto Rican neighborhood and providing a showcase for the vibrant culture that has come to New York from Latin America. About half of the museum's collection is from Puerto Rico or by Puerto Rican artists.
El Museo was founded in 1969 as a grass-roots organization by artists from East Harlem, also known as El Barrio. First opened in a public school classroom, the museum moved into the city-owned Heckscher Foundation building, a former orphanage, in 1977. It shares space with five other tenants, including a charter school with 800 students. 
"We have half of the first floor, a third of the third and one-fifth of the basement, and that's it," said Marga Bergman, capital projects coordinator for El Museo. "It is a completely inappropriate situation for a museum, an ad-hoc situation. We have no toilet, no coat room, no cafe."
The proposed relocation of the city museum has created bitter feelings in parts of East Harlem, where community representatives were stung by the mayor's failure to inform them that they were about to lose a distinguished cultural institution.
"That building was built for the museum, and the museum has been there through thick and thin, and I think it should remain," said David Givens, chairman of Community Board 11 in East Harlem. 
City Councilman Philip Reed said that the opposition to the relocation extended beyond his East Harlem district. "All elected officials are apprehensive about this," he said. "Of course the city museum would like to move into a new museum -- and I would like a brand new apartment -- but so far nobody has come up with the money to fix it," he added, referring to Tweed Courthouse renovation, estimated to cost $125 million.

PERSON: Arturo Uslar Pietri 

HEADLINE: Arturo Uslar Pietri, Novelist of Venezuela, Is Dead at 94 

BYLINE:  By SIMON ROMERO 

 BODY:
Arturo Uslar Pietri, a novelist and essayist whose literary career became enmeshed with modern Venezuelan politics, died on Monday at his home in Caracas. He was 94.
 Mr. Uslar Pietri had retired from writing just recently, after failing health led him to dictate essays and columns for newspapers to a secretary instead of typing them himself. 
 Although he was born in 1906 to a family of relatively modest means -- his father was an officer in Venezuela's army -- Mr. Uslar Pietri had a privileged education, studying at the French School in Caracas before his family moved to the provincial city of Maracay in 1915.
Upon his return to Caracas as a teenager, Mr. Uslar Pietri became engrossed in literature. In addition to European classics, he was influenced by the first modernist Latin American writers, like Ruben Dario, the Nicaraguan poet, and Jose Enrique Rodo, the Uruguayan essayist who called on Latin America to resist the materialistic influence of the United States.
After graduating from the Central University of Caracas in 1929 with a doctorate in political science, Mr. Uslar Pietri traveled throughout Europe and the Middle East. At 25 he published his first, and perhaps best-known novel, "Las Lanzas Coloradas" ("The Red Lances"), in Madrid. Mr. Uslar Pietri later said he had written the book "during a spring in Paris."
In the novel, which was translated into English in 1963, Mr. Uslar focused on a mestizo, or man of mixed race, who rebels against his masters. The backdrop for the narrative is Venezuela's struggle for independence from Spain, from 1812 to 1814, led by Simon Bolivar. As in his later works, Mr. Uslar Pietri champions mestizaje, or miscegenation, as a valuable feature of Latin American culture.
In a tale that was transformed into lore for a later generation of writers, like Carlos Fuentes and Gabriel Garcia Marquez, who fueled the boom in Latin American literature in the 1960's and 70's, Mr. Uslar Pietri was said to have feverishly discussed the direction of Latin American writing during an encounter in 1930 on the Pont des Arts in Paris with the writers Alejo Carpentier of Cuba and Miguel Angel Asturias, the 1967 Nobel Laureate from Guatemala. 
Early classics of 20th-century Latin American literature, including Mr. Uslar Pietri's "Red Lances," Carpentier's "Kingdom of This World," and Asturias's "Legends of Guatemala," were said to have germinated from that meeting. 
"Uslar warned us, and strengthened us, against the dark impulses of literary chauvinism," Mr. Fuentes, the Mexican writer, wrote in the newspaper Reforma. 
In 1934 Mr. Uslar Pietri returned to Venezuela. He published several collections of short stories and, after becoming professor of economic policy at Catedra University, was appointed education minister during the regime of Gen. Eleazar Lopez Contreras in 1938.
During the subsequent government of Gen. Isaias Medina Angarita, which began in 1941, Mr. Uslar Pietri continued his participation in public office, serving as interior minister. After a military coup removed Medina in 1945, Mr. Uslar Pietri went into exile in New York.
During the years he spent in the United States Mr. Uslar Pietri taught Latin American literature at Columbia University and wrote his second historical novel, "The Road From El Dorado" (1947), based on the life of the conquistador Lope de Aguirre. He also published a book of essays based on his lectures at Columbia before returning to Venezuela in 1950.
While still in New York, Mr. Uslar Pietri had begun writing a weekly column called "Pizarra" that appeared until the 1990's in the newspaper El Nacional. After publishing several books on Venezuelan history and culture, Mr. Uslar Pietri returned to politics in 1958 when democratic elections were held after the fall of the dictator Marcos Perez Jimenez. Mr. Uslar Pietri was elected to the nation's senate in 1958, representing the capital, Caracas. 
In 1963 Mr. Uslar Pietri ran for president with the support of a coalition of parties, including the Democratic National Front. His slogan was "Arturo is the man." Mr. Uslar Pietri was defeated by Raul Leoni, of the Democratic Action Party.
Mr. Uslar Pietri never tired of commenting on Venezuelan society and politics. Often, in essays or in interviews, he delivered a harsh critique of Venezuela. Once, Mr. Uslar Pietri said historians could sum up the nation's history in nine words: Columbus discovered it; Bolivar liberated it; oil rotted it. 
In a 1992 interview with The New York Times, referring to the effect that the discovery of oil in Venezuela more than 80 years ago had had on the nation, Mr. Uslar Pietri said: "Venezuela is not a country -- it's a country glued to an industry."
Mr. Uslar Pietri was similarly critical of Venezuela's current leader, Hugo Chavez, who led an unsuccessful coup attempt in 1992, only to be elected president in 1998. "He is not democratic," Mr. Uslar Pietri warned late last year, suggesting that Mr. Chavez had a disposition for "caudillismo," the system of rule in which a strongman or military dictator rules a country with little concern for democratic institutions. "Caudillismo has never disappeared," Mr. Uslar Pietri said. "It is part of our history and has cost us plenty."
In all, Mr. Uslar Pietri was the author of nearly 50 books, including novels, plays, stories, essays, travelogues, poetry and collections of journalistic work.
He is survived by a son, Federico Uslar Braun.

Having It All

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
A little puff of smoke went up over the Capitol the other night to signal: We have a president. His style holds the low key to the kingdom. 
 The president (we no longer have to identify him by name and initial) was reasonable and amiable. He stuck to positions presented during his campaign and in his first month in office. Best of all, he was not his predecessor. 
 The message in his budget speech was that we could have it all. More federal dollars to education and science (liberal) coupled with mild restraint in spending increases elsewhere (conservative). A box festooned with locks to protect Social Security (liberal) combined with a plan for partial private investment accounts (conservative). A paydown of the national debt to reduce interest rates (once conservative, now liberal). And above all, tax cuts (about time, say conservatives; me-too but less, say liberals).
This was not exactly a call to sacrifice. The "hard choices" are among goodies. The first Bush budget will be alive on arrival because Congressional debate is centered on ways to divide America's expanding pie. 
This optimistic certitude even has a number: the solemnly agreed-upon estimate of $5.6 trillion in surplus over the next decade. Democrats will counter by rejiggering priorities within that number -- half the tax cuts and that much more federal spending -- so that they, too, can "have it all."
Hold on. All this is bottomed on breathtaking suppositions. First is that the long-range prediction will be on target. But not long ago, economists were sure of deepening deficits "as far as the eye can see"; now they are equally certain of huge surpluses as far as their other eye can squint. 
The one certainty, however, is that the $5.6 trillion number being murmured like a mantra will be off by a few trillion either way (not to mention a couple of hundred billion in loose change if this year's tax cut is retroactive). 
Democrats are aware of that, and -- eager as ever to keep taxes, spending and government involvement climbing -- have struck a pose of caution. They counterpropose a "trigger" to halt the decade's tax cutting if yearly surpluses disappear. That would automatically raise taxes during recessions, a course that contributed to the Great Depression. 
Republicans in the Bush White House and in Congress are aware of the evanescent quality of that $5.6 trillion number, too. Their whispered explanation: the surplus could be twice as big -- who knows where we'll be in 10 years? But by stretching out the projections you can determine the general direction of taxing and spending. 
To do that, the Bush team had to pick a number, stand fast on what percentage it wants to give back in tax cuts, and insist that its crystal ball is crystal clear. A $1.6 trillion tax cut, including the death of the death tax, is political victory; anything less than three-quarters of that is defeat, with the fallout to be used by a popular president against recalcitrant Democrats in 2002. 
The second breathtaking leap presupposes that this 107th Congress will determine the budget decisions of the next four Congresses, and that this president will bind the budget of presidents to 2010. 
But almost every tax change is changed by the following Congress, and even the most sweeping reforms are themselves reformed within five years. The next president, no matter who she is, will hoot at President Bush's exercise in hubris back in 2001 (before the inflation, or recession, or war, or incredible boom). "The president proposes, but Congress disposes," goes the adage, but the presidential proposals get blown away by events, and Congressional disposal is never dispositive. 
Therefore, the citizen bombarded from both sides with outlandish numbers about "out years" should ask: What are you going to do for me, and take from me, in the short term -- say, this Congress and the next, and this president's four-year term? 
Nobody wins intellectual hosannas for saying "Take the short view." Political economists much prefer the long view, with its golden vistas, because the short view is measurable and its proponents accountable. 
Conservative realists don't expect to "have it all" in the sweet by-and-by. That's why we look for tax reduction and spending restraint here and now.

HEADLINE: W.T.O. Rules Against U.S. in Steel Case 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: GENEVA, Feb. 28 

 BODY:
The World Trade Organization ruled today that the United States had acted illegally in deciding to increase duties on Japanese steel imports.
 A panel of trade experts said the United States International Trade Commission had been wrong when it refused to consider information from three Japanese steel companies because their submissions had arrived late. 
 The increased duties were put in place in June 1999 after United States steel companies and steelworkers associations complained that Japanese hot-rolled steel was being dumped at below-market prices, making it impossible for United States producers to compete.
The commission carried out an investigation and upheld the claim. Extra duties were also imposed on steel from Brazil and Russia. Japan took its complaint to the World Trade Organization last year.
In its 713-page report, the panel said that the United States commission's conclusion that the Japanese companies had failed to cooperate was "not a decision that could properly be made by an unbiased and objective investigating authority."
It ordered the United States to "bring its measures into conformity" but rejected a suggestion by Japan that it order Washington to remove the duties immediately.

When it comes to cloning, social science has to catch up with genetic science.

BYLINE:  By Alan B. Krueger; This column appears here every Thursday. Alan B. Krueger is the Bendheim Professor of Economics and Public Affairs at Princeton University and editor of The Journal of Economic Perspectives. E-mail: akrueger@princeton.edu

 BODY:
THE field of genetics is moving at mach speed. In January, an international team of doctors announced plans to clone a human within 18 months. In February, two teams of researchers published a map of the human genome. While Wall Street frets over whether the discovery that the genome consists of "only around 30,000 genes" will limit the market value of genomics companies, the potential impact of genomics on the economy and society runs much deeper. Most fundamentally, cloning and genetic engineering could change the distribution of characteristics in the population.
 By most accounts, the remaining technical hurdles are about to be cleared to make human cloning feasible. Cloning is a prerequisite for genetic engineering, the process of altering or adding genes to an embryo. If the experience of earlier reproductive technologies like in vitro fertilization is a guide, the marketplace -- not government regulation or prevailing ethical norms -- will determine who avails themselves of cloning services. At an estimated cost of about $250,000 a clone, market forces loom large. 
 Although it ventures into the wilder realms of science fiction to ponder the effect all this will have on the population, some biologists and economists have begun to do just that.
The Princeton molecular biologist Lee M. Silver weaves a scenario in his book "Remaking Eden" (Hearst Books, 1997) that makes Malthus look like an optimist. If left to the marketplace, he argues, there is a real possibility that genetic engineering will lead to a two-class society, populated by well-off, genetically engineered "GenRich" individuals whose parents could afford genetic engineering, and impoverished "Naturals," conceived the old-fashioned way. He also foresees overpopulation, and the two classes splintering into distinct species, with the GenRich viewing Naturals much the way humans now view chimpanzees.
To many economists, Professor Silver's dismal forecast is, well, too dismal. Gilles Saint-Paul of Toulouse University has written a provocative paper, "The Economics of Human Cloning," that explores the impact of cloning if people seek it for a purely selfish reason: to capture part of the income earned by their clone. People also derive pleasure from having biological children in his model. He predicts that the most talented people will be cloned and the least talented women will be hired as surrogate mothers. After several generations, the distribution of income would become more nearly equal because fewer women would be willing to be surrogates at the market price.
Eventually, cloning produces a classless society in which demand for cloning disappears because everyone has high-ability genes.
The reason for this optimistic forecast is that economists tend to think prices eventually adjust in response to changes in supply or demand.
Suppose the work force consists of low-ability individuals (burger flippers) and high-ability individuals (entrepreneurs), who perform complementary tasks. If someone like Ray Kroc, McDonald's founder, is cloned dozens of times, increasing the supply of entrepreneurs, there would be a flood of fast-food restaurants, depressing the profit of entrepreneurs and increasing the demand for and pay of burger flippers. Market forces would place a check on the exploding income gap.
Whatever the impact of cloning, it appears researchers are on the verge of learning much more about the genetic determinants of health and other life outcomes than their social and environmental determinants. This imbalance is unfortunate -- even dangerous -- because, as Professor Silver observes: "Environment and genes stand side by side. Both contribute to a child's chances for achievement and success in life, although neither guarantees it." Moreover, even with the mapping of the genome, the molecular biologist Shirley Tilghman of Princeton says we are still in the Dark Ages when it comes to understanding the combinations of genes that contribute to intelligence and personality.
Environmental factors may be overlooked in a rush to develop drugs that are aimed at particular genes -- even though environmental changes like preschool attendance or pollution abatement may be more cost-effective, more ethically acceptable and sometimes a prerequisite for genetic-based cures to work.
That environmental factors like education matter for economic outcomes is clear. For example, among identical twins -- who are more alike genetically than clones would be because they receive the same mitochondrial DNA from their mother's egg -- the twin with more education tends to earn a higher salary.
True, incomes are more highly correlated between identical twins than fraternal twins, suggesting that genes affect income. But the correlation is far from perfect and not all that much greater than for fraternal twins, which suggests that environmental factors are important.
Similarly, a study of 45,000 pairs of Scandinavian twins published in The New England Journal of Medicine last year found that among pairs of male twins, if one identical twin was diagnosed with cancer, there was a 29 percent chance that the other was, too, while if a fraternal twin was diagnosed with cancer, his twin had a 22 percent chance.
Although such contrasts are fraught with problems -- including the possibility of more similar environments for identical twins, a limited range of environmental differences, and interactions between genes and the environment -- findings like these do suggest that environmental factors and luck are the main determinants of one's economic fortunes and health.
Apart from education, however, there is little concrete evidence on the environmental factors that contribute to economic success. And most research on which education approaches work best for different types of students, and why, remains in the Dark Ages.
Researchers are also in the dark as to why health outcomes are so much better for those with higher-status jobs, as was found in the White Hall studies of British civil servants.
To address the imbalance between the state of knowledge in genetics and the behavioral sciences, Dr. Jack Stenner, chief executive of MetaMetrics Inc. in Durham, N.C., proposes a Human Phenome Project -- a concerted national effort to map the ways in which genetic and environmental factors interact to produce life's outcomes. After having financed much of the research that enabled scientists to map the human genome, maybe the National Institutes of Health could use some of its proposed $2.8 billion budget increase to begin this effort.

HEADLINE: As Japan's Premier Falters, No Successor Is in Sight 

BYLINE:  By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 28 

 BODY:
Public esteem for Japan's prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, has fallen so low that with only a 6.5 percent approval rating in some surveys, his polling numbers are beginning to resemble a typical poll's margin of error.
 Mr. Mori's weakness has caused every major newspaper here to predict his imminent demise, and many have urged him to step down. 
 Yet for all the forecasts that he will not be able to hold on for more than a few more days at best, for the first time in memory this country finds itself without an obvious successor. 
Calls for Mr. Mori's resignation grew today as Takenori Kanzaki, leader of the governing Liberal Democratic Party's largest coalition partner, the New Komeito, said at a news conference that the prime minister should announce his resignation before a Liberal Democratic convention scheduled for March 13. 
Representatives of Japan's leading opposition parties also met today to discuss a no-confidence motion, which they said would be introduced in Parliament this week.
In the past, the Liberal Democrats have always had a powerful figure who, guided by his own instincts and a lot of backroom politicking, would have anointed a new prime minister by now and probably would have have eased Mr. Mori out.
But the last of the great string-pullers, Noboru Takeshita, died last year without a clear successor. And many say that the pretenders to that role, including the party's secretary general, Hi romu Nonaka, discredited themselves and the party's secretive system of choosing leaders through their selection of Mr. Mori last April.
Mr. Mori fell afoul of voters most recently by continuing to play golf for nearly two hours after he was told of the accidental sinking of a Japanese ship by an American submarine off Hawaii. Throughout his brief tenure in office he has shown a startling talent for verbal and political faux pas. 
Still, many here feel that his fate reflects deeper problems in a system that has shuffled through seven mostly ineffectual prime ministers in the last decade.
With signs of weakness everywhere, from record high unemployment and record lows in the stock market to soaring disaffection with the Liberal Democratic Party, everyone from political scientists to newspaper pundits have begun to conclude that the dominance of the conservative party, which has held power for all but a few months since 1955, is about to end.
"In the old days prime ministers were picked according to a logic that was inherent only to the L.D.P. and not the nation as a whole," said Yasuhisa Shiozaki, one of the party's members of Parliament. "But that worked at a time when the bureaucrats were deciding everything, and not the politicians. With the problems we have, it won't work any longer."
This is not to say that potential candidates are not being bruited about.
Three names come up incessantly in Japanese news coverage: former Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, Mr. Nonaka and a former health and welfare minister, Junichiro Koizumi.
But to hear these men themselves speak about the prospect of becoming prime minister, one would think that the post was more of a poison pill than a prize. Asked recently if he would accept the job, Mr. Nonaka, who is 75 and said to be ailing, called such a prospect "200 percent impossible." Mr. Hashimoto, who is currently state minister for administrative reforms, described himself this week as "only concerned with the 2001 budget." Mr. Koizumi told a reporter who asked him if he wished to become the next prime minister to stop being silly.
To be sure, these denials partly reflect the shadow-act quality of Japanese politics, where it is seen as both bad form and bad luck to boldly display one's ambitions in public. In fact, all three men are said to be keenly interested in the job.
What is holding them back from staking a firmer claim on power, if only in the back-room councils of the party, political analysts here say, is the widespread sense that politically as well as economically, Japan is at one of the weakest point in its postwar history and that a political system that has been one of the world's most stable is badly overdue for a shake-up.
"As a nation, there is a sense that we are falling behind the times," said Tomoaki Iwai, a political scientist at Nihon University in Tokyo. "But still there is no consensus about what kind of system we should have.
"Everyone agrees that we need drastic reform, but you need leadership to have reform, and we need reform in order to have leadership. We seem to be stuck in a rut and can't advance by pulling or by pushing."
Japan must hold an election for the upper house of its Parliament in July, and if the Liberal Democratic Party suffers a defeat as big as those in several recent elections, it will lose its majority and may even break up.
"Whoever is prime minister will have to carry responsibility for the L.D.P.'s defeat and will have a very short term," said Minoru Morita, a political analyst. "In fact, although the L.D.P. leaders think it will last forever, it looks like the party is about to see the very end of its era."

HEADLINE: Justices Join Argument On Spending For Elections 

BYLINE:  By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 28 

 BODY:
Jan Witold Baran, a leading Republican election lawyer, told the Supreme Court today that any limits on how much direct help political parties could give candidates for federal office amounted to a "clear, direct and substantial infringement" of the parties' right of free speech.
 But Barbara D. Underwood, the acting solicitor general who argued for the Federal Election Commission, contended that the limits, enacted in 1974 and raised to account for inflation, were a safeguard against rich individuals using the parties as a "conduit to corrupt candidates." 
 At issue in the case, which began in 1986, is a provision of federal law that allows parties to coordinate some spending with candidates, but puts limits on that spending. There are no limits on independent expenditures by parties and others, but they are supposed to be made at arm's length from the candidates. 
But the use of coordinated expenditures has dropped sharply since the case began. Parties prefer to use the hard money they get from regulated contributions in combination with the unregulated soft money from rich individuals, unions and corporations. The Federal Election Commission requires some hard money to be used with soft money.
The only disadvantage this approach carries is that parties cannot use phrases like "vote for" or "vote against," standards the Supreme Court created in its 1976 interpretation of the 1974 act. Those words can be used in advertisements bought with regulated contributions, like the $1,000 individuals can give candidates each election and the $20,000 they can give parties each year. But academic research has shown that this is a distinction without a difference; viewers see advertisements that praise candidates in the same terms as those that ask for votes.
In 1986, the Republican House and Senate campaign committees spent $14,057,719 on coordinated expenditures. In 2000, if their spending had merely kept pace with inflation, they would have spent $21,436,616. But in fact it dropped to $3,682,017. 
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor kept asking what difference it would make if the limits were thrown out, and neither lawyer answered her in terms of practical politics. 
Politicians from both parties say the case, Federal Election Commission v. Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee, No. 00-191, does not matter much under present circumstances. But they say that if Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and others succeed in their effort to ban soft money, then the decision in this case would be very important. Overall spending could soar again if the limits on party expenditures -- amounting in 2000 to $67,560 for a House race and $3,272,876 for the biggest Senate race in California -- were eliminated.
As it often does, some of the most vigorous argument came from the justices. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist began by demanding to know "how receiving a contribution would corrupt a political party."
Ms. Underwood said it was the candidate to whom the money would be funneled who could be corrupted.
Justice Stephen G. Breyer said that it would be easy for a candidate to tell rich supporters to contribute $20,000 each to a party, and that if 50 families of four contributors did so, that would raise $4 million. Mr. Baran said that would be legal now, but Mr. Breyer replied that the party could spend only a small fraction of that amount on coordinated expenditures in most races, "but if you win this, the limitation is gone." He also said that regardless of provisions in the law against earmarking such contributions, parties and candidates kept track and sent the money where it was meant to go.
Justice Antonin Scalia argued that limits on party spending were unfair. He said a candidate could be corrupted if someone made an independent expenditure of $100,000 in advertising "and it says at the bottom of the ad, you know, 'paid for by Schwartz,' and the candidate knows Schwartz has bought hundreds of thousands of dollars of television advertising."
But Justice Scalia said the government was oblivious to the risk that "although rich individuals can take out their own television ads, a party which gets contributions from Joe Sixpack in 5 and 10 dollar amounts cannot do that to support a candidate."

HEADLINE: U.S. Lowers Growth Rate In 4th Quarter 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 28 

 BODY:
The economy grew at a weaker pace than previously thought in the last three months of 2000, the government said today.
 Gross domestic product, which measures the value of goods and services produced in the United States, grew at a revised annual rate of 1.1 percent in the fourth quarter, the slowest pace in five and a half years, the Commerce Department said today. The rate had initially been estimated at 1.4 percent. 
 The revised figure was half of the 2.2 percent recorded in the third quarter and was the slowest quarterly pace since a 0.8 percent gain in the second quarter of 1995, when the economy was coping with overstocked inventories.
"We are in a meaningful slowdown," said Robert G. Dederick, economic consultant to the Northern Trust Company in Chicago.
The revision was above estimates from analysts, who had predicted a revised gain of 1.0 percent. The government said it cut its fourth-quarter growth estimate to reflect the latest data for inventories, exports and imports.
Business inventories rose at an annual rate of $59.5 billion in the fourth quarter, down from $72.5 billion in the third quarter and revised from a previously reported $67.1 billion, the Commerce Department said. 
Analysts said the inventory revision suggested that manufacturers were keeping up with slowing demand better than previously thought.
"What we saw was that the quarter saw a dramatic slowing in final sales, but we did manage to slow the rate of inventory accumulation," Mr. Dederick said. "I think some progress was made in correcting the inventory imbalances toward the end of the quarter."
Exports fell 6.1 percent in the fourth quarter, revised from a 4.3 percent decline. Imports fell 0.7 percent, down from a 0.5 percent gain.
Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of economic growth, rose at a 2.8 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, revised from a previously reported 2.9 percent gain. Consumer spending in the third quarter rose 4.5 percent.
Spending has been hurt by declining consumer confidence, which Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, and other central bankers have highlighted as a factor for keeping the record economic expansion on track. 
The Conference Board, a businessresearch group, said on Tuesday that consumer confidence in February was at its lowest level in more than four and a half years.

HEADLINE: Limited Plans to Sell Lane Bryant Chain 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: COLUMBUS, Ohio, Feb. 28 

 BODY:
Limited Inc. said today that it would put its Lane Bryant chain up for sale, rename its Structure chain and reorganize management after fiscal fourth-quarter profit fell.
 Limited, one of the nation's largest clothing retailers, will integrate the troubled Structure men's stores into its Express division and rename them Express Men's, the company said. 
Michael Weiss, Express's president and chief executive, will oversee both the women's and men's businesses. 
 Limited's net income in the quarter ended Jan. 29 fell 25 percent. Limited was among the retailers that cut prices in the holiday season after stock market declines and higher fuel prices dampened spending. Limited said profit growth this year would be modest and the first three quarters would be challenging because of the slowing economy.
Limited's stock fell 28 cents, to $17.65. It had risen 5.4 percent the last year. The announcement was made after the close of regular stock trading.
Intimate Brands, which is 84 percent owned by Limited, gave a similar outlook on Tuesday. Intimate owns the Victoria's Secret and Bath and Body Works chains. 
Limited said fourth-quarter net income fell to $238.2 million, or 54 cents a share, from $316.5 million, or 70 cents, a year earlier. Sales rose 6.9 percent to $3.52 billion from $3.3 billion.

HEADLINE: China, Under Fire for Its Record, Ratifies Major U.N. Rights Pact 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Feb. 28 

 BODY:
The government ratified an important United Nations human rights treaty today, even as its own rights record has continued to come under increasing international criticism and scrutiny.
 The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress approved the International Convention on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights a day after the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, Mary Robinson, visited China. 
 But the government's brief official announcement suggested that it might hedge on a full commitment to the part of the treaty that is the biggest problem for China, Article 8, which proclaims the right to form and join free labor unions. 
According to the New China News Agency, the lawmaking body agreed to assume the obligations prescribed in Item 1(a) of Article 8 in line with "provisions of China's Constitution, Trade Union Law and Labor Law."
The law recognizes just one union, which is state-sanctioned, and prohibits the formation of independent groups. The Constitution does not recognize the right to strike. China has jailed dozens of people for independent labor activity.
"On the one hand, this is a big step forward," Mike Jendrzejczyk of Human Rights Watch in Washington said. "But it makes it even more urgent, now, that China bring its labor laws into compliance with international labor laws and practices."
The Chinese clearly hope that the ratification will sway two votes. On March 19, a United Nations human rights meeting in Geneva will vote on whether to censure China for its continuing problems. Perhaps more important to China's leaders, in July, the International Olympic Committee will decide whether to give Beijing the 2008 Summer Games.
A spokesman for the high commissioner's office in Geneva, Jose Diaz, said it had not received the official documents from China and could not yet comment. Mr. Diaz said a clarification of the Chinese position could take time, although "it is in their interest to do it quickly."
On Tuesday, Ms. Robinson said, "a serious reservation on Article 8 would be extremely disappointing."
The convention allows member countries to enter "reservations" on treaty clauses, indicating that such parts will not be followed. United Nations officials said it was not clear whether China was planning to enter a reservation to the union clause or if it was merely signaling its intent to interpret the clause. 
Still, Ms. Robinson said the ratification would be "enormously important legally and psychologically for China," providing a "real tool and a framework" for progress in rights, because it mandates periodic United Nations evaluations of China's record, including its labor practices. 
The convention's goals include safe work places, free compulsory primary education and equal pay for women. Members are subject to periodic United Nations inspections. Even if China does not register a reservation, the treaty gives countries fairly wide discretion in carrying out its terms. 
The article states that "no restrictions" may be placed on the right to organize, "other than those prescribed by law and which are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public order or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others."
This week, China indicated it was not close to signing what is considered in the West to be a more important convention. The accord, the Convention on Civil and Political Rights, enshrines rights like universal suffrage, freedom of association and freedom to live where one chooses.

HEADLINE: Panel Calls for Reparations in Tulsa Race Riot 

BYLINE:  By ROSS E. MILLOY 

DATELINE: OKLAHOMA CITY, Feb. 28 

 BODY:
Although only 5 years old at the time, George Monroe still remembers the night in 1921 when white men burned down his family's home in Tulsa, Okla.
 "They came in the house with torches, and my mother hid us four wee children under the bed," Mr. Monroe said. "They set the curtains on fire and, as one guy was leaving, he stepped on my fingers. My little sister slapped her hand over my mouth to keep me from screaming out." 
 "That's what I remember most, my little sister's hand slapped over my mouth."
And as Mr. Monroe, now 84, watched the Oklahoma Commission to Study the Tulsa Race Riots of 1921 deliver its final report at a news conference today -- recommending that reparations be paid to survivors and their descendants -- he was feeling stifled once again.
"People need to speak out," said Mr. Monroe, whose family lost the roller-skating rink his father operated and two houses during the riots. "We deserve to be paid something for what happened to us."
Few argued today with the 11-member panel's conclusion that the events of May 31 and June 1, 1921, were among the worst cases of racial violence in the nation's history. 
The panel, appointed by the Legislature, said up to 10,000 whites stormed the prosperous Tulsa neighborhood of Greenwood, once called the "black Wall Street," killing at least 40 people and destroying 35 blocks of homes and businesses. But the commission's call for reparations received a more skeptical response.
Gov. Frank Keating expressed the state's regrets, calling the events "an unforgivable, unexplainable part of our history," but stopped short of endorsing reparations.

Adair, speaker of the State House of Representatives, said, "I think everyone is going to proceed with caution on reparations, adding "We've not really had a formal request saying what the total package would be, and until we know what we're being asked to consider, we're taking a 'wait and see' attitude." 
The commission's report said the amount of reparations was a matter for the Legislature to decide.
The 200-page report describes a night of horror, sparked by a false accusation of rape against a black man and fueled by white envy over a rising black middle class: homes were set aflame, planes dropped turpentine bombs, and the unarmed black men were shot on the street. 
Some state leaders expressed more interest in the commission's recommendations for a memorial to the victims and possibly some kind of economic empowerment zone for the Greenwood district than in reparations.
"When this started, we were looking at recognition of the significance of the events, but I don't think anyone originally talked about us having to make payments to families or any sort of settlements," Mr. Adair said.
Governor Keating did say he would be willing to raise money for a memorial to the 1921 riot victims.
Despite the cool reception that reparations are receiving among lawmakers, Representative Don Ross, who sponsored the bill that created the commission, which included public officials, historians and business leaders, seemed unwilling today to give up on the idea.
"Reparations can take many forms, and we'll just wait to see what happens in this case," he said. "But I believe good-thinking people will want something to be done." 
He added: "We told these people to lift themselves up by their bootstraps, and they did, by forming the most successful black community in America. And once they had lifted themselves up by their bootstraps, we destroyed them for it."

HEADLINE: Budget Battle Begins With Dueling Estimates

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Feb. 28 

 BODY:
The annual budget debate began in earnest this week as the two houses of the State Legislature put out their own revenue estimates, both higher than the figure in Gov. George E. Pataki's proposed budget.
 Following a longstanding ritual, the governor and the leaders of the Senate and the Assembly must first agree on how much money is available before talks about how to spend that money become serious. 
 The negotiations this year are taking place against a dismal backdrop, as the economy shows every sign of slowing down and may slip into a recession. The federal government reported today that the national economy grew only 1.1 percent in the last three months of 2000, the weakest performance in five years.
Still, budget experts from both houses say state income tax revenue has been flooding in during 2001, fueled almost entirely by capital gains on Wall Street. Though the New York economy will slow down, it should still produce more in taxes than the governor has projected in his $83.7 billion budget, they say.
The question is, how much more? 
Two weeks ago, Governor Pataki revised his estimate of revenues upward, saying there would be an additional $450 million in tax collections by the end of the fiscal year. He is now predicting a surplus of $1.7 billion, and he pledges to put all that money into a reserve to guard against an economic downturn. 
But the Assembly, which is controlled by the Democrats, maintains that the governor has underestimated the revenue for the fiscal year ending on March 31 by $603 million, and by $1.5 billion next year. All that would mean $2.1 billion more to work with next year, said the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver. The Assembly's estimates assume that the economy will grow 2.4 percent and personal income will grow 5.3 percent.
"Economic growth has slowed, but the longest economic expansion in American history has not ended," Mr. Silver said.
The Senate, controlled by Republicans, is more pessimistic. Abraham M. Lackman, the Senate budget director, predicts that the economy will grow only 2 percent this calendar year. "This is a moment for some caution," Mr. Lackman said. 
But Mr. Lackman's report to Senate leaders also says the governor's revenue projections are too low. It predicts that an additional $747 million will come in this fiscal year and $493 million in the next, giving lawmakers about $1.2 billion more to distribute than the governor has budgeted.
A spokesman for Mr. Pataki said the governor would consider the Senate's predictions, but had rejected the Assembly's numbers.

HEADLINE: Drug Runners' Tunnels Test the Agents in a Border Town 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: NOGALES, Ariz., Feb. 28 

 BODY:
The authorities in this border town today discovered a cache of illegal drugs inside yet another hand-dug tunnel connected to a sewer line that smugglers had used to get drugs out of Mexico and into the United States.
 About 350 pounds of marijuanawas pulled out of a hole in the concrete floor of a commercial garage less than a mile from the Mexican border. It was a modest discovery by any measure, worth only $300,000 or so on the street, said James A. Woolley, assistant special agent at the Drug Enforcement Administration's offices in Tucson. 
 But this was the second such tunnel found here in three days -- and the seventh in the last six years -- evidence that smugglers were still using the hilly landscape of Nogales to their advantage. In each case, the tunnel was connected to a city sewer line that was connected in turn to underground culverts that carry water and debris from Mexico into southern Arizona. 
Typically, smugglers walk or crawl the drugs through the culverts and the sewer lines before leaving the contraband for someone else to fish out from the floor of the hand-dug tunnels here and load onto vehicles for transport northward.
Ingenious? Not especially, said Kyle E. Barnette, associate special agent in charge of the Customs Service office in Tucson, whose agents scored big on Monday, intercepting 840 pounds of cocaine at a house to which one 25-foot tunnel led not far from the garage. He said agents believed the cocaine to be 95 percent pure, with a street value well above $6 million. 
"If you can imagine it, the smugglers can, too," Agent Barnette said of the various means of drug transport that border agents have encountered over the years. "And just because we catch them doesn't mean they won't try again."
Agent Barnette said some of the tunnel discoveries had led to arrests. But the drug business has become so sophisticated, he said, that most people involved in it perform only one task, like dropping the drugs at the mouth of a culvert, moving them through or pulling them out of the tunnel for delivery to a driver.
"It has become a very specialized operation," said Matthew C. Allen, group supervisor for the Nogales office of the Customs Service. "There's the grower, the marketer, the transporter, and that creates an insulating factor. Most of these people involved don't know each other."
For that reason, he said, American and Mexican authorities often cannot easily identify others involved in the trafficking through arrest of someone who might have dug the tunnel.
In both cases this week, the authorities said, there have been no arrests, and the property owners are still being sought.
Nogales has always been a busy spot for drug running, as well as the smuggling of illegal immigrants, on the Mexican border. Michael Unzueta, the Customs Service's deputy executive director, Operations West, said the town generally ranked among the most active places for drug smuggling and interdiction, along with San Ysidro, Calif., Yuma, Ariz., and El Paso. 
Already this year, the Customs Service has recorded 50 arrests, 30 indictments and 18 convictions related to drugs in the Nogales area. The tallies are slightly behind those for the corresponding period last year, but numbers alone rarely measure effectiveness, Agent Barnette said, adding: "Imagine squeezing a water balloon. You increase pressure one place, the water goes somewhere else. Same with smugglers."
The lure of Nogales, a high-desert town of about 22,000 across from a Mexican city of the same name with nearly 20 times the population, has been the rugged terrain. Well below the single-family homes that dot the hills on both sides of the border, underground culverts connect the two countries and open several miles inside Arizona, providing smugglers a cozy means of conveyance. By cutting through the sewer lines to which the culverts connect, the smugglers gain access to drop points at the end of the hand-dug tunnels.
Most of the tunnels, elbowing from horizontal to vertical, have been dug through concrete on the floors of houses, although in 1999 investigators found one connected to Sacred Heart Roman Catholic Church, a majestic old building on a bluff about a half-mile from the border.
The commercial garage where the latest tunnel discovery was made today sits across from a busy shopping center and offices of the state's Economic Security Department. Pointing to it, Agent Woolley said: "The novelty of this is that it's an operational business. Nobody would have thought anything of it."
As investigators pulled bundles of marijuana out of the tunnel and gathered other evidence, Agent Woolley turned to Mr. Unzueta, the Customs Service official, who was visiting the area from Washington. "It's been a good week for Nogales," Agent Woolley said. "We ain't winning, but at least we're making dents."

HEADLINE: Booming New York Skirts Trend of Job Losses 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
Economic clouds may be gathering over much of the nation, but in New York City the jobs picture remains relentlessly sunny, according to new data from the State Department of Labor.
 Take the unemployment rate, for example. In New York City, the jobless rate fell sharply in January, to 5.1 percent from 5.6 percent. That drop came as the percentage of people looking for work nationally rose in January, to 4.2 percent from 4 percent in December. The figures were adjusted for seasonal factors. 
 Or look at jobs. True, the number of jobs in the city fell from December to January -- it does so every year, because stores and restaurants no longer need their extra holiday help. But this year, despite all the doom and gloom about the economy, the decline in the number of jobs was actually smaller than last year's, when the economic outlook was rosy.
The city's economic resilience has surprised some economists, who had predicted that the slumping stock market would crimp the city's growth. Instead, problems are occurring mostly in manufacturing -- little of which is in the five boroughs. 
"Nationally, there are signs of stress, but they're not in your backyard," said Mark M. Zandi, chief economist at Economy.com, an economic research firm. California, too, remains strong, he said, while economic softness is concentrated in the Midwest and the Southeast, areas where cars, steel, chemicals, appliances and the like are produced.
Western New York State, where many auto parts are made, has been hit by the national slowdown. In Buffalo, the unemployment rate is 5.8 percent, and over the last 12 months the number of jobs has grown by just 0.3 percent -- far below New York City's increase of 2.3 percent.
The rest of New York is faring better, but newly revised figures for last year highlight the split nature of the state's economy. The Labor Department found that there were an additional 13,300 jobs in New York City, while the figures on many upstate cities showed slight declines in the number of jobs (Syracuse lost the most, 2,700).
Excluding government and farm jobs, employment upstate grew by just 1.2 percent in 2000. Employment downstate, which includes the city, its suburbs and Long Island, grew by 2.8 percent, more than the national average of 2.1 percent.
Stephen Kagann, Gov. George E. Pataki's chief economist, said it was wrong to compare a commercial economy like New York City's with an industrial one like that of upstate New York. Compared with places like Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan, he said, "upstate is holding its own and doing reasonably well."
Sounding a note of caution, Mr. Kagann noted that the rate of job growth in the city had probably peaked in the fall, though it remained robust. But, he contended, the increasingly diverse economy in the city, along with changes in state tax policy, made it unlikely that the city's economy would fall off a cliff the way it did in the early 1970's and again in the early 1990's.
Surveys show that New Yorkers are nevertheless concerned about their economic futures. Consumer confidence may have fallen less sharply in the region than in places like the Southeast, but it still fell last month, according to a monthly survey by the Conference Board, a business research group.
And a survey of employers by Manpower Inc., the temporary employment agency, found that only 12 percent of employers planned to add jobs this spring, while 10 percent expected to reduce the number of their employees. A year ago, 28 percent of the employers surveyed expected to add workers, and only 8 percent foresaw cutbacks.
On the other hand, a monthly survey of businesspeople by the National Association of Purchasing Managers found that New Yorkers are more optimistic about the economic outlook now than they were in December. And current business conditions, which peaked in November, remained steady last month.

HEADLINE: De Beers Posts Solid Results But Predicts a Tougher Future 

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: LONDON, Feb. 28 

 BODY:
De Beers posted sales of $5.67 billion for 2000 but said today that it expected an economic slowdown in the United States, which accounts for half the world's trade in polished stones, to reduce sales 15 percent this year -- nearly $900 million.
 The forecast decline, which illustrates the volatility of the diamond trade, was much steeper than the 10 percent drop De Beers expected just 13 days ago as it announced plans to go private in a buyout by the Oppenheimer family; De Beers's sister mining company, Anglo American; and a smaller company jointly owned by De Beers and the government of Botswana. 
 De Beers rejected suspicions that it had exaggerated the expected fall in sales this year. Some shareholders say De Beers is undervaluing its diamond business to make a buyout cheaper for the Oppenheimers and their allies and less profitable for outside investors. 
But Andrew Lamont, a De Beers spokesman in London, said the forecast "relates entirely to the market outlook."
De Beers said sales reached a record last year, as wholesalers bought rough diamonds to replenish stocks that had been run down in 1999 in a premillennium buying spree in the $57.5 billion global retail market. It said net income in 2000 rose 84 percent, to $1.29 billion.
But demand for diamonds eased after the millennium, with sales of uncut stones slumping to $2.15 billion in the second half of 2000 from $3.52 billion in the first half. If sales drop 15 percent this year to $4.8 billion, they will be at their lowest since 1998.
Despite the poor prospects for diamond sales, De Beers struck a $400 million deal in January with LVMH- Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton to market its branded stones in the top-end retail market dominated by companies like Bulgari and Tiffany. De Beers gave no indication that it was reconsidering the deal, but the chairman, Nicky Oppenheimer, stressed today that De Beers's "prime business remains the mining and marketing of rough diamonds."
De Beers mines in southern Africa account for 43 percent of the world's rough diamond production, but because of sales contracts with Russian and Canadian mines, it controls about 65 percent of the global trade in uncut stones.
Its dominance has raised antitrust concerns in the United States since 1945, and De Beers still faces an indictment brought by the Justice Department in 1994.
De Beers executives say they cannot travel to the United States without risking arrest. In fact, Gary Ralfe, De Beers's managing director, said that when he travels next month to seek support from North American investors for the buyout of De Beers, he will make his pitch in Toronto.
Mr. Ralfe said De Beers is waiting for the Bush administration to appoint officials in the Justice Department before again seeking a review of its case. A year ago, Mr. Oppenheimer sought a meeting with American antitrust regulators on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Switzerland, but was rebuffed.

Stocks Fall After Greenspan's Comments Dash Hopes for Rate Cut

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
Stocks slumped again yesterday after Alan Greenspan held out little hope for an immediate cut in short-term interest rates.
 Mr. Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said in testimony to Congress that the economy had been stronger in January and February than it was at the end of 2000. With that outlook, the Fed is unlikely to cut rates again before its regularly scheduled meeting on March 20, analysts said. 
 Wall Street, which has watched many companies report lower-than-expected earnings and announce layoffs since last fall, would have preferred an immediate rate cut to help shore up the economy and the stock market. Lower interest rates are usually considered good for stocks because they lower the cost of borrowing and make bonds a less attractive alternative investment.
With prospects for a quick cut fading, investors sold stocks, hitting technology and financial companies especially hard. 
After opening higher, the Nasdaq composite index finished the day down 55.99 points, or 2.5 percent, to 2,151.83. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 18 points, or 1.4 percent, to 1,239.94, and the Dow Jones industrial average sank 141.60 points, or 1.3 percent, to 10,495.28.
The day's biggest losers included Oracle, which fell $2.69, to $19, and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, which sank $4.53, to $65.13.
The overall declines ended a dismal February. For the month, the S.& P. 500 fell more than 9 percent, while the Nasdaq plunged 22 percent, its third-biggest monthly decline ever. Since reaching its record high last March, the Nasdaq has dropped 57 percent. The S.& P. 500 is now down 19 percent from its March high, just short of the 20 percent drop that indicates a bear market.
After rallying briefly in January, when the Fed cut rates twice, stocks have sagged again on reports of sharply declining consumer confidence and job cuts. The bad news continued yesterday, as Gateway, the maker of personal computers, said that profits for its first-quarter would fall short of expectations and that it might close some stores.
"There was quite a bit of disappointment among investors who expected Fed chairman Greenspan to just wave his wand and make all the pain go away," said Ed Yardeni, chief investment strategist of Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown. "His statements did not support the view that we should expect a rate cut before the March 20 meeting."
Mr. Yardeni said he hoped Mr. Greenspan would act again before the Fed's regular meeting. "In an environment where there is a potential for forces to spiral to the downside, having the Fed act more quickly is warranted," he said.
Robert Bacarella, manager of the $170 million Monetta mutual fund, said he thought investors had overestimated Mr. Greenspan's ability to turn the economy quickly. "We don't know where the bottom is," he said. "I think the market is trying to suggest to us the slowdown might be a lot worse than what the Fed thinks."
Mr. Bacarella said he did not particularly care whether the Fed cut interest rates immediately or in three weeks. He says many technology stocks have fallen to attractive prices, but he does not want to invest aggressively until he sees the economy growing again, he said.
"It takes time for these things to filter through," he said.
Charles Pradilla, chief investment strategist at SG Cowen, said investors should not expect a quick turn for earnings. "Everybody's gotten it wrong, including Greenspan," Mr. Pradilla said. "Nobody expected sentiment and the economy to decelerate so rapidly, and companies to take such very, very quick action."
Mr. Pradilla said investors had some reasons for hope. Long-term interest rates have fallen sharply over the last year, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note falling to 4.9 percent from 6.6 percent in January 2000, he said. That could provide a foundation for higher stock prices if companies can start their earnings rising again, he said.
But investors will have to be patient, he said. "I don't think Nasdaq can get out of its own way until the summer," he added.

Treasuries Up as Equities Fall On Greenspan's Testimony

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices rose yesterday as stock markets slumped after the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, quashed hopes for an immediate reduction in interest rates to revive the economy.
 Mr. Greenspan, testifying before the House Financial Services Committee, left little doubt that risks of excessive economic weakness warranted even lower borrowing costs even after the Fed twice lowered short-term interest rates in January. 
 But financial markets had been speculating in advance that Mr. Greenspan would signal at the hearing that conditions were so weak that the Fed was likely to lower rates well before its next scheduled policy meeting on March 20.
"There was certainly no smoking gun here that says an intermeeting rate cut is going to occur," said Alan Ruskin, research director at 4Cast Ltd.
Short-term Treasury notes, which had rallied since last week as dealers bet that a rate cut was imminent, initially sagged as Mr. Greenspan said the economy was skewed toward further weakness, but that the sharp slowdown of late 2000 was "less evident" in January and February. As stocks fell amid disappointment over the testimony, however, money flowed into government bonds.
The government said yesterday that the economy grew at a 1.1 percent annualized rate in the fourth quarter of 2000, its slowest pace in five and a half years, down from a preliminary growth rate of 1.4 percent.
The 10-year Treasury note rose 11/32, to a price of 100 26/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.90 percent from 4.94 percent on Tuesday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 14/32, to 100 28/32. The bond's yield fell to 5.32 percent from 5.35 percent on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Chairman Show Revision of Views 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 28 

 BODY:
 Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, testifying before the House Financial Services Committee today, repeated, with some changes, a report on the economy that he had presented to a Senate committee two weeks ago. Following are the revised passages, compared with his original remarks before the Senate on Feb. 13, and excerpts from an exchange between Mr. Greenspan and Representative Michael G. Oxley, Republican from Ohio and chairman of the committee, in a question-and-answer session after the testimony, as recorded by Federal News Service Inc.: 

Today
With signs of softness still patently in evidence at the time of its January meeting, the F.O.M.C. the Federal Open Market Committee retained its sense that downside risks predominate. The exceptional degree of slowing so evident toward the end of last year (perhaps in part the consequence of adverse weather) seemed less evident in January and February. Nonetheless, the economy appears to be on a track well below the productivity-enhanced rate of growth of its potential and, even after the policy actions we took in January, the risks continue skewed toward the economy's remaining on a path inconsistent with satisfactory economic performance.

Feb. 13
The exceptional weakness so evident in a number of economic indicators toward the end of last year (perhaps in part, the consequence of adverse weather) apparently did not continue in January. But with signs of softness still patently in evidence at the time of its January meeting, the F.O.M.C. retained its sense that the risks are weighted toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future.

Today
Changes in consumer confidence will require close scrutiny in the period ahead, especially after the steep falloff of recent months. But for now, at least, the weakness in sales of motor vehicles and homes has been modest, suggesting that consumers have retained enough confidence to make longer-term commitments; and, as I pointed out earlier, expected earnings growth over the longer run continues to be elevated. 
Obviously, if the forces contributing to long-term productivity growth remain intact, the degree of retrenchment will presumably be limited. In that event, prospects for high productivity growth should, with time, bolster both consumption and investment demand. Before long in this scenario, excess inventories would be run off to desired levels. Higher demand should also facilitate the working off of a presumed excess capital stock, though, doubtless, at a more modest pace.

Feb. 13
Although consumer confidence has fallen, at least for now, it remains at a level that in the past was consistent with economic growth. And as I pointed out earlier, expected earnings growth over the longer run continues to be elevated. If the forces contributing to long-term productivity growth remain intact, the degree of retrenchment will presumably be limited. Prospects for high productivity growth should, with time, bolster both consumption and investment demand. Before long in this scenario, excess inventories would be run off to desired levels.

MR. OXLEY: Mr. Chairman, back when we had our last really full-blown recession in 1982, the markets almost inexplicably rebounded very quickly, and the mantra at that time was "first Wall Street and then Main Street." Do we face the reverse of that this time? That is, are the markets potentially reflecting a downturn over all, and should we be concerned about that?

MR. GREENSPAN: Well, the history on that is mixed, Mr. Chairman. In fact, as an old colleague of mine once said, "The stock market forecasted five of the last two recessions." And so we have to be careful about being fairly strict in analyzing what stock prices and equity values are doing and what is happening to demand.
Having said that, there is no question, as I indicated in earlier testimony, that the so-called wealth effect has been a very prominent factor in the major expansion in economic activity, especially since 1995. And clearly, with the market reversing, that process does indeed reverse. Whether it, in and of itself, is enough to actually induce a significant contraction, which in retrospect we'll call a recession, is yet too early to make a judgment on.

HEADLINE: Whitman Backs Clinton Rules Designed to Cut Diesel Pollution 

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 28 

 BODY:
The Bush administration has decided to let stand regulations imposed by President Bill Clinton that are intended to reduce substantially the pollution caused by diesel fuel and engines, officials said today.
 In a victory for environmentalists, Christie Whitman, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, said she would support the regulations, which were drafted by Clinton officials in a last-minute flurry of new rules and then put on hold when President Bush took office in January. 
 Mrs. Whitman said the new standards would eventually cut pollution from heavy-duty trucks and buses by 95 percent and reduce the sulfur content of highway diesel fuel by 97 percent. The move, she said, would prevent an estimated 8,300 premature deaths and tens of thousands of cases of bronchitis each year. 
"The Bush administration determined that this action not be delayed in order to protect public health and the environment," Mrs. Whitman said. "I look forward to working with state and local governments to meet their air quality goals as well as with citizens and businesses to ensure that diesel trucks and buses remain a viable and important part of the nation's economy."
Under the new regulations, diesel producers will be required to virtually eliminate sulfur from the fuel. Sulfur produces soot and clogs up a vehicle's catalytic converter, the device that removes other pollutants. With the removal of sulfur, manufacturers of diesel engines will be required to incorporate the sophisticated pollution-control devices that are standard equipment in cars.
The changes will be phased in. About 80 percent of all diesel fuel must be virtually sulfur-free by 2006, the rest by 2010. Engine manufacturers will have until 2010 to complete their modifications.
Environmentalists and public health advocates praised Mrs. Whitman's decision. 
Carl Pope, the executive director of the Sierra Club, said the move would significantly ease respiratory problems for children and adults.
"Because of this decision, children with asthma will be able to spend more time outdoors," Mr. Pope said in a statement. "The elderly and people with respiratory problems will be able to breathe easier."
Frank O'Donnell, the executive director of the nonprofit Clean Air Trust, said the rules affecting everything from delivery vans to 18-wheel tractor-trailers would result in the equivalent of removing 13 million trucks from the road.
But diesel producers, truckers and other industries that depend on that fuel voiced concerns that the regulations would require expensive capital improvements and possibly force small refiners out of business.
"Diesel is the lifeblood of commerce in this nation," said Jay McKeeman, the executive vice president of the California Independent Oil Marketers Association. 
Mr. McKeeman warned that the increased costs would be felt throughout the economy.
"When you start tinkering with diesel and its costs," Mr. McKeeman said, "you are going to have an automatic ripple effect in all segments of the economy. The use of diesel is pervasive."
Mrs. Whitman said the phase-in period gave companies sufficient time to upgrade their equipment. The plan will have special provisions offering greater flexibility for small manufacturers, officials said.

HEADLINE: Fed Chief Sees Bumpier Road For Economy 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 28 

 BODY:
Two weeks after suggesting that the economic downturn was likely to be relatively brief, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, gave Congress a somewhat more pessimistic assessment today, saying the slowdown "has yet to run its full course."
 He left little doubt that further interest rate reductions were coming to follow up on the two half-point cuts made by the Fed in January. But Mr. Greenspan dashed the hopes of investors, who have increasingly looked to the Fed to rescue the stock market from its swoon, that he would signal a rate cut before the Fed's next scheduled meeting on March 20. 
 The result was a broad sell-off again on Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 141.60 points, to close at 10,495.28. The Nasdaq composite index fell 55.99 points, finishing the day at 2,151.83.
"Our take on his appearance was that the Fed is on track to reduce rates, but won't act until March 20 unless something unforeseen happens before then," said David Orr, chief economist at First Union Capital Markets.
Mr. Greenspan's appearance before the House Financial Services Committee came just after the Commerce Department reported that economic growth the last three months of 2000 fell to 1.1 percent, its slowest annual pace in more than five years.
Mr. Greenspan's testimony largely tracked what he said in an appearance before the Senate Banking Committee on Feb. 13. He reiterated that in his view the long-term outlook remained bright and that the business cycle appeared to have accelerated in recent years, both on the way down and on the way back up.
The main reason, he said, is that businesses have invested heavily in technology that allows them to identify quickly and respond to what is happening in the marketplace -- and to improve their productivity, or output per hour.
But he altered his presentation in a few instances, striking a somewhat less optimistic tone that reflected continued deterioration of consumer confidence in recent weeks as well as other new data suggesting that the economy may not have bottomed out yet.
The economy, he said, "appears to be on a track well below the productivity-enhanced rate of growth of its potential and, even after the policy actions we took in January, the risks continue skewed toward the economy's remaining on a path inconsistent with satisfactory economic performance."
When he appeared before the Senate two weeks ago, Mr. Greenspan said the nation had not slid into recession and that consumer confidence was at a level "that in the past was consistent with economic growth."
Today, he suggested that consumer confidence had declined to potentially more worrisome levels. 
Gauges of confidence "will require close scrutiny in the period ahead, especially after the steep falloff of recent months," he said. "But for now, at least, the weakness in sales of motor vehicles and homes has been modest, suggesting that consumers have retained enough confidence to make longer-term commitments."
In response to a question, Mr. Greenspan said the Fed preferred to raise or lower interest rates at its regularly scheduled meetings, although he added that it would act between meetings if necessary, as it did in early January.
And while he suggested that ups and downs on Wall Street had some effect both on the economy and on consumer confidence, he gave no indication that the Fed would cut rates just to prop up tumbling stock prices.
That was not a welcome message to investors, who had speculated the last few days that the Fed would cut rates by another half percentage point or even more this week in an effort to keep the stock market from cracking.
"Investors are forewarned," said Richard Yamarone, an economist at Argus Research. "The Federal Reserve is in the business of managing the economy, not the financial markets -- especially not the Nasdaq."
But Mr. Greenspan made a point of noting that because the economy can shift gears with greater speed nowadays, the Fed will, too. 
Pressures on the economy that first began appearing in 1999 "have engendered a retrenchment that has yet to run its full course," Mr. Greenspan said. "This retrenchment has been prompt, in part because new technologies have enabled businesses to respond more rapidly to emerging excesses. Accordingly, to foster financial conditions conducive to the economy's realizing its long-term strengths, the Federal Reserve has quickened the pace of adjustment of its policy."
Mr. Greenspan did not signal any concern about recent inflation reports suggesting that price increases were picking up even as the economy is slowing down. Some analysts have said that any lasting pickup in inflation could inhibit the Fed from cutting rates as aggressively as it would otherwise in coming months.
Economists at Credit Suisse First Boston said in a report today that Mr. Greenspan's "depiction of current conditions was more cautious than in his Senate testimony two weeks ago."
But some economists said the downturn was even more pronounced than Mr. Greenspan was letting on. Ian Shepherdson, an economist at High Frequency Economics, said Mr. Greenspan might be reluctant to make the situation worse by signaling the economy is falling apart. 
Moreover, Mr. Shepherdson said, Mr. Greenspan might want to avoid encouraging Republicans in Congress to bid up the size of President Bush's proposed $1.6 trillion tax cuts on the ground that a declining economy needs additional fiscal stimulus.

HEADLINE: Memo Feeds Concern That Exports to U.S. Help Burmese Junta 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Myanmar, which has been governed by a military junta for more than a dozen years, is rapidly increasing apparel exports to the United States despite American economic sanctions.
 A newly declassified State Department cable describes how factories in Myanmar, formerly Burma, have produced garments for leading American designers and retailers, including Kenneth Cole, Nautica, Jordache, Kmart and Wal-Mart. 
 The cable, written by the American Embassy in Myanmar's capital, Yangon, to the secretary of state voices concern that Myanmar's military leaders are benefiting financially from these shipments because most of the factories are joint ventures partly owned by the military government. 
"The Burmese garment industry is booming -- growing 45 percent in the last year," said the cable dated last July.
In 1999, the cable said, Myanmar exported $168 million worth of garments to the United States, but those shipments more than doubled last year, soaring to $403.7 million. That places Burma's apparel exports to the United States well above France's, at about the same level as Israel's exports to the United States.
Four years ago, President Bill Clinton banned new American investments in Myanmar, but the government has not banned all trade, although it has encouraged companies not to do business there. Mr. Clinton took those actions because of the military junta's repression of the democratic opposition and its leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, a winner of the Nobel Peace Prize.
The cable was obtained from Senator Tom Harkin, an Iowa Democrat who along with Senator Jesse Helms, a North Carolina Republican, and Senator Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, has called for the ban on apparel imports from Myanmar. "Here we have perhaps the most brutally repressive military regime in the world," Senator Harkin said. "And by importing all this apparel from there, we're putting close to half a billion dollars into their coffers every year."
Most of Myanmar's garment factories, the cable states, have been financed by Korean, Taiwanese and Hong Kong manufacturers that have turned to Myanmar because they are bumping up against quotas imposed by the United States limiting imports from their countries.
Jessica Moser, a Wal-Mart spokeswoman, said the company's American stores stopped importing apparel from Myanmar three years ago. She added that Wal-Mart stores in other countries only stopped such imports about a year ago.
Michele Jasukaitis, of Kmart, said, "We do not import directly from Burma, and we double-check our distribution centers for any indirect imports from Burma."
Kenneth Cole officials acknowledged that one of the designer's subcontractors had been importing sweaters from Burma, but the company said it terminated such imports from Myanmar as soon as it learned about them several months ago.
Nautica and Jordache officials did not return telephone calls.

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET: THE PROMOTIONAL CAMPAIGN; 
Bush Takes His Tax Proposal on Tour

BYLINE:  By FRANK BRUNI 

DATELINE: OMAHA, Feb. 28 

 BODY:
President Bush took his proposed $1.6 trillion tax cut and hit the road today, traveling to the heartland in the hope of building enough support to propel the measure through Congress untrimmed and untrammeled.
 He also talked about the rest of his presidential to-do list: more money for education, the revamping of Medicare and Social Security, military pay raises and an effort to eliminate nearly two-thirds of the $3.4 trillion federal debt over the next decade. 
 But he presented this slate of initiatives as what remained possible and affordable even if taxes were reduced by the figure he had specified over a 10-year period. Mr. Bush said he could do and pay for it all, and he suggested that some of the people who had insisted otherwise were gluttons for big government. 
"So we've set priorities," Mr. Bush told a crowd of several hundred supporters at a convention center here, referring to the budget outline that the White House released today and that the president foreshadowed in a State of the Union-style address to Congress on Tuesday night.
"We've paid down $2 trillion of debt," Mr. Bush continued. "We've got a trillion dollars of contingency set aside over the next 10 years. And there's still money left over."
"There's still money left over," the president repeated. And that, he added, was one reason he was so adamant about a tax cut. He appealed directly to his audience -- and to any American his words reached -- to help him make it happen.
"I'm here to ask you to join me in making the case to any federal official you can find," Mr. Bush said.
Hours earlier, in Beaver, Pa., near Pittsburgh, Mr. Bush said, "I might as well be just very upfront," explaining that he was traveling the country as part of "ginning up support for this plan."
That was Mr. Bush's first stop on a two-day, five-state tour intended to promote his legislative agenda, the centerpiece of which is a tax cut that is by no means guaranteed to pass the Senate, where the Republican-Democratic split is 50-50 and two Republicans have indicated reservations about the plan. One Democrat, Zell Miller of Georgia, has said he will support Mr. Bush's plan.
Mr. Bush's awareness of the challenge he faces was reflected in his itinerary, which was taking him to states with important Democrats he needs to woo or Republicans he needs fighting hard at his side.
Here in Nebraska, Senator Ben Nelson, a freshman Democrat, has not announced his position on Mr. Bush's proposed tax cut, but he has sent a few smiles in Mr. Bush's direction.
He did so again today, riding on Air Force One with the president and appearing with him at the rally-style event here.
Mr. Nelson told reporters he had serious qualms about the country committing to a tax cut without knowing for certain that federal surpluses would be as large as projected.
But he also said that he had been heartened by Mr. Bush's comments over recent days about paying down the federal debt.
"He understands I haven't signed on yet," said Mr. Nelson, who squeaked to victory in November while Mr. Bush trounced former Vice President Al Gore in Nebraska. "I'm looking for reasons to be there."
Another Senate Democrat whose vote White House officials hope to get is Max Cleland of Georgia, a state Mr. Bush just happens to be visiting on Thursday. His trip also includes Iowa and Arkansas.
Many Democrats are pushing a smaller tax cut, saying that they would like to devote more money to debt repayment and that Mr. Bush's proposal was too generous to the most affluent people in the country, whose tax rate would drop to 33 percent from 39.6 percent.
Those concerns are shared by enough Americans that even a few Bush supporters in Omaha acknowledged misgivings about the tax plan.
"I still think it's going to be a tax cut for the wealthy," said Karen Mohvic, 38, a paramedic here.
Even so, Ms. Mohvic said, she supported it, because her own calculations showed that she would save about $2,000 a year.
Others in the convention center expressed a less qualified enthusiasm. "If I order something from a catalog and I overpay, I expect to get money back," said Bill Boyd, 46, a hospital worker. Mr. Boyd said the same thinking should apply to taxes and surpluses, meaning he expected a refund from the government.
Mr. Bush promised one, saying that low- and middle-income people, not the rich, would get the largest tax reductions in terms of percentages. And he portrayed cutting taxes as a way to control the size of government, which he said would in turn help the economy.
Mr. Bush told workers at Control Concepts, a small business in Beaver, that "a sure way to make sure this economy gets drug down is to overspend."
In talking about a $1 trillion contingency fund, Mr. Bush was painting an incomplete picture. The additional spending he has advocated above and beyond the growth of current services would take a significant bite out of that amount.
But Mr. Bush mostly told the people at his events today what they wanted to hear, even digressing during his remarks in the Midwest to reiterate his support for federal subsidies for ethanol. It was if he had traveled back in time to his presidential campaign, and he frequently used lines and phrases from the speeches he gave then.
There did not seem to be many skeptics at today's events, which were carefully assembled. Control Concepts, which makes electrical switches for industrial machines, files taxes in a manner that would enable it to see a reduction under Mr. Bush's plan.
The president's audiences showered him with applause and his mood was correspondingly buoyant, though he was also basking in the satisfaction he and aides expressed about his performance in his address to Congress.
One aide said Mr. Bush was so energized after the speech that he talked with a friend in the White House until about midnight, two hours past his usual bedtime.

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET: THE CONTEXT; 
Surplus Feast: Will Tax-Cut Appetizer Leave Room for Debt-Slice Dessert?

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 28 

 BODY:
During his run for the presidency, George W. Bush declared daily that Washington's budget surpluses should be returned to the people whose taxes created them. On Tuesday night, for the first time, Mr. Bush began discussing in detail the national debt that has to be repaid by the people who are saddled with it.
 Both sound like conservative principles: tax cuts to reduce the size of government and its burden on the national economy, debt repayment to run the government the way Americans are supposed to run their households. And, in fact, the budget Mr. Bush published today is a conservative's dream: it slows the pace of spending, cuts a few of the programs championed by the previous administration and returns $1.6 trillion to taxpayers over the next decade. 
 But very little in Washington is exactly what it seems, and this is no exception. Paying down the debt and "saving Social Security first" became, in the Clinton years, Democratic ideas, which Mr. Bush is now paying homage to in an effort to win over Democrats and secure quick passage of his tax cut.
The details released today, however, suggest something a bit more subtle.
Mr. Bush has now redefined the national debt, so that it looks more manageable. And Mr. Bush's aides are arguing that it does not need to be paid off so fast -- which, conveniently, leaves them a bit more room for their own favorite programs, like a national missile defense, new spending on education and creating private Social Security accounts.
All of this raises two questions: Which party is pursuing the more conservative course? And what does it say about the ideology of George W. Bush, whose "compassionate conservatism" seemed at times an effort to dress up the philosophy of Ronald Reagan in the moderate poll-tested oratory of Bill Clinton?
In fact, the battle now breaking out in Washington may turn the traditional definition of conservatism on its head. While Republicans have long been the party of tax cuts, Mr. Clinton tried to transform the Democrats into the party of "fiscal discipline," the one that would cut the debt first and then see what was left for tax cuts.
Mr. Bush's approach appears to be exactly the reverse -- cutting taxes first and then using what is left for debt reduction -- but the current political climate prevents him from saying so.
"There is a risk, when you add up all the initiatives in Bush's speech, that it will leave us at zero -- that there will actually be no paydown of debt," said Allen Sinai, the chief economist at Primark Decision Economics.
"Bush can't say that because the overwhelming conventional wisdom is that paying down the debt is good," said Mr. Sinai, who himself believes that paying off the debt entirely is not the best way to make use of the surplus.
"So Bush sets debt paydown as a goal," Mr. Sinai added, but effectively leaves it for last.
The reason is clear. For Mr. Bush and his team, the essence of post-Clinton conservatism is shrinking taxes first, building a national missile defense and giving individuals more control over how their Social Security contributions are invested. It is what one of Mr. Bush's aides calls "the modern Reagan legacy." Paying down debt is fine -- as long as it does not get in the way of Mr. Bush's other priorities.
For the first few weeks after his inauguration, almost everything broke Mr. Bush's way in this debate. The Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, rode to his rescue, endorsing a tax cut, though he would not go so far as to approve the one Mr. Bush proposed, and suggesting that debt paydown could go too far. Mr. Bush seized on the economic slowdown to create a rationale for acting fast, arguing that lower interest rates alone could not revive the American economy. 
Today the Treasury secretary, Paul H. O'Neill, told the Senate Finance Committee that this might be the best moment in recent American history for a tax cut. "These circumstances are really unique," Mr. O'Neill said.
"The structural tax system is going to throw off so much money," he went on, that "we have to do something with it." 
And the new director of the Office of Management and Budget, Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., seizing on projections of a budget surplus that would continue to rise despite the economic slowdown, argued today that "there is vastly more than enough room" to repay the national debt at "historic levels" while still financing government initiatives "at moderate growth rates."
Mr. Daniels is right, if everything goes the way the administration wants it to go, which rarely happens here.
He has to assume that Congress will go along with all the cuts the Bush administration has proposed in 10 agencies. But many of those cuts will face intense opposition -- from the Commerce Department's Advanced Technology Program for research and development to more than 300 agriculture programs that Congress has allocated for farmers. Members of Congress of both parties cannot bear to see their constituents cut out of an expanding pie.
Then, of course, the surpluses have to materialize. And finally, Mr. Bush has to find a way to pay for missile defenses and military reform and those new private Social Security accounts. "Each of those is hundreds of billions of dollars," said Robert L. Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition, a bipartisan group that spent the 90's advocating deficit reduction and now presses for big paydowns of the debt. "While there is a lot of money around, there is not enough for all of those."

HEADLINE: In America; 
Voodoo Redux

BYLINE:  By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
It was a good speech, well written and well delivered. The president was relaxed, gracious, funny at times, even eloquent.
 He seemed so reasonable that it was difficult to tell from Tuesday night's speech that -- under the comforting cloak of his nice-guy conservatism -- George W. Bush plans to take the country on yet another wild and reckless economic ride. 
 Mr. Bush has gotten very good at masking the problematic aspects of his party's agenda. Ronald Reagan may have been more polished, but Mr. Bush is at least as good -- maybe better -- at hiding disturbing truths. 
The Bush tax cuts are too big and too skewed to the rich. But the president, with his smiling, aw-shucks demeanor, tells us not only that the size of the tax plan is "just right," but also that it's the best thing in the world for lower-income people. Listen:
"People with the smallest incomes will get the highest percentage of reductions. And millions of additional American families will be removed from the income tax rolls entirely." 
Now that seems pretty good. 
But Robert Greenstein, director of the respected Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, made the following very sobering comments about the Bush tax plan in testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee two weeks ago:
"Over all, 12 million families with 24 million children -- one of every three children in the United States -- would receive no tax reduction. Some 75 percent of these are working families. Some 55 percent of African-American children and 56 percent of Hispanic children live in families that would receive nothing from the proposed tax cut."
Mr. Bush did not bring that up during his speech. Nor did he mention that the wealthiest 1 percent of American families would devour nearly 40 percent of his tax cuts.
And if this tax cut passes and goes into effect, you can say good night to the entire projected non-Social-Security surplus over the next 10 years. Trust me, it will be gone.
There is, of course, a particularly bizarre deja vu quality to all of this. Ronald Reagan argued that massive tax cuts would prove an elixir for a troubled economy. Before hopping on the bandwagon as Mr. Reagan's vice president, George Herbert Walker Bush -- the current president's father -- famously derided Mr. Reagan's supply-side tax-cutting philosophy as "voodoo economics."
In his celebrated biography of Mr. Reagan, Lou Cannon wrote that James Baker, the elder Bush's close friend and longtime ally who served as Treasury secretary in the Reagan administration, would come to regret the fact that the budget deficits had "gotten away" from the administration. Mr. Baker wished, wrote Mr. Cannon, that "he had paid more attention to the consequences of the tax cuts."
Now we have another chance to pay attention to the potential consequences of a massive tax cut, a chance to look beyond George W. Bush's pretty words and affable demeanor to the debilitating reality of a government starved for cash for years to come.
The Democratic response to Mr. Bush's speech was not particularly well received. But the Congressional leaders Tom Daschle and Richard Gephardt, however ill at ease they may have seemed Tuesday night, have learned valuable lessons about the dangers of excessive tax cuts.
"In 1981," said Mr. Daschle, "Dick and I sat in the House Chamber when another new president talked to the American people about stimulating our economy. The words spoken that evening were strikingly similar to the message we heard tonight. We were promised that if we gave huge tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans, the benefits would trickle down, deficits would disappear and the economy would flourish.
"Congress supported that experiment. It was a huge mistake. As President Bush's own treasury secretary, Paul O'Neill, said recently, it put America 'in a ditch that was horrendous.' "
It took 18 years of hard work and struggle, Mr. Daschle said, "to get out of that ditch."
President Bush quoted Yogi Berra on Tuesday night, but he could have pulled a better selection from the library of Yogi-isms. After all, it was Yogi who coined the wonderful phrase "It's deja vu all over again."

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET: THE PROPOSAL; 
PRESIDENT UNVEILS $1.96 TRILLION PLAN THAT TRIMS TAXES

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 28 

 BODY:
President Bush today proposed a $1.96 trillion federal budget for next year that would cut taxes, increase spending on education, medical research and the military but scale back corporate subsidies, health care grants for poor areas, agricultural research and a host of other programs.
 Mr. Bush's tax and spending framework, his first detailed statement of priorities, immediately drew attacks from Democrats. They said the president's budget would provide a tax-cut windfall to the wealthy while raiding money needed to keep Medicare healthy and requiring cuts in the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Energy, Interior, Justice, Labor and Transportation. 
 But Mr. Bush said his plan would prudently restrain the growth of government spending and provide the money needed to address issues he considered priorities. 
At the same time, he repeated his case that the projected federal surplus of $5.6 trillion over the next decade made his $1.6 trillion tax cut in the same period affordable, even after going a long way toward eliminating the national debt and setting aside money to create private investment accounts in Social Security.
Under his plan, Mr. Bush would begin phasing in reductions in the income tax rate and other provisions of his plan next year. But he has signaled that he would support efforts in Congress to begin phasing in the tax cut this year.
"The surplus is not the government's money," Mr. Bush said in Omaha today in the first day of a two-day trip to sell his tax cut and budget plan. "The surplus is the people's money. And I'm here to ask you to join me in making that case to any federal official you can find."
After six years in which President Bill Clinton's budgets were declared dead on arrival by the Republican majority on Capitol Hill, Republicans said Congress would take Mr. Bush's proposal seriously as it began drawing up its own spending plans.
Republican leaders acted quickly to give Mr. Bush's tax plan some political momentum, saying the House Ways and Means Committee would take up his proposal to reduce income tax rates on Thursday.
But even some Republicans acknowledged that Congress would find it difficult to cut programs, especially at a time of growing surpluses. And Democrats sought to reshape the budget by arguing that Mr. Bush's plan relied on money that was supposed to be off limits: $526 billion over the next 10 years in temporary surpluses from one division of the Medicare system. 
Most members of both parties in Congress have agreed that the Medicare surplus should be off limits for new spending or tax cuts, a restriction rejected by the administration. 
"His budget framework begins to tell the story that in order to enact his tax cut, something is going to have to give," said Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader in the House. "And in this case, that something is the soundness of our economic future and the immediate needs demanded by the budget."
In presenting his budget, Mr. Bush cast himself not as an ideological warrior in the mold of Newt Gingrich, who as speaker of the House in the mid-1990's led an effort to slash the size and influence of government, but as a pragmatic manager of the nation's resources.
He proposed an increase of 4 percent, or $25.7 billion, in spending on general government programs outside of Social Security and Medicare, to $660.7 billion for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1 from $635 billion in the current fiscal year. 
That increase would be slightly above what it would cost for the government to keep up with rising costs, but below the rate of increase in the past several years, including last year's increase of 8.6 percent.
And although Mr. Bush would seek to slow the growth in spending on Medicare, long a target of conservatives, he also proposed spending $156 billion over the next decade to add a program that would help retirees pay for prescription medicine.
The broad numbers obscured the ways in which increases in some areas were offset by cuts in others.
The Pentagon's budget would increase by $14.2 billion, to $310.5 billion. Education would get an additional $4.6 billion, bringing the total to $44.5 billion. The State Department's budget would increase $1.2 billion, to $23.1 billion. Despite having its overall budget cut, the Energy Department would get an additional $120 million next year for a program to help low-income homeowners insulate their houses.
But the increases in those areas and others would be largely offset by cutbacks elsewhere.
Eight of the 15 big cabinet-level departments would see their budgets decline in dollar terms, and some of the smaller agencies, like NASA, would barely keep pace with inflation. Even within some departments that would get an overall increase, some programs were slated for cutbacks or elimination.
Mr. Bush's 207-page budget document did not specify where all of the cuts would be made, but it provided some examples.
The Agriculture Department would lose $44 million for construction of research laboratories. The Commerce Department would suspend, pending a review, one of Mr. Clinton's initiatives, the Advanced Technology Program, which subsidizes research by corporations.
The Department of Health and Human Services would kill a $125 million program that sought to provide health care to the uninsured because other programs offered the same service. A drug-abuse prevention program run by the Department of Housing and Urban Development would be ended because the administration concluded that it had been ineffective.
Mr. Bush is also proposing to eliminate what budget analysts call earmarks and what most voters would call pork-barrel projects, programs proposed by members of Congress to benefit their districts or particular constituents. Mr. Bush's budget relies on eliminating $4.3 billion of them next year.
He has also targeted another $4.1 billion in one-time financing, which usually goes to emergencies like fighting forest fires but sometimes gets built in year after year.
Critics said the budget appeared to be deliberately vague about where the cuts would be made. And they said the scale of the cuts was understated because Mr. Bush did not include other initiatives that will come up in the next few years. Among them are development of a national missile defense, acquisition of a new generation of weaponry for the military and tax cuts with bipartisan support other than those included in the president's $1.6 trillion plan.
"This is a budget that conveniently omits the necessary costs of various ongoing items and the costs of administration priorities like missile defense, in part to avoid allowing policy makers and the public the tradeoffs that the tax cut entails," said Robert Greenstein, executive director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research group. "It's kind of a game of hide the ball."
In addition to setting out his spending plans, Mr. Bush's budget fleshed out his long-term proposals. 
The administration estimated that the surplus would be $5.644 trillion over the next 10 years. Of the total surplus, $2.591 trillion would come from Social Security, the administration said, and would be used only to reduce the national debt or to help create private investment accounts within the retirement system.
Mr. Bush said that he would allocate $1.62 trillion to his tax cut, $153 billion to adding prescription drug coverage to Medicare, $20 billion for general spending and $417 billion to the additional interest costs from using the surplus for purposes other than debt reduction.
That would leave $842 billion over 10 years for what Mr. Bush termed a contingency fund, which would pay for initiatives that his budget does not provide for specifically. 
But Democrats said that fund would quickly be exhausted. Once realistic estimates of other needs are taken into account, from aid to farmers to additional tax provisions to the administration's own proposals for increased military spending, the budget could slide back into deficit, Democrats said.

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET: THE REACTION; 
Republicans In the House Advance Plan For Tax Cuts

BYLINE:  By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 28 

 BODY:
Acting swiftly to capitalize on President Bush's address to Congress, House Republicans put forward a $958 billion, across-the-board reduction in income tax rates today and said they would pass it through the House next week as the first stage of the tax cut.
 The introduction of the measure by Representative Bill Thomas of California, the Republican who heads the House Ways and Means Committee, opened the political battle over tax cuts that will be the defining first act of the Bush presidency. And putting maximum pressure on Democrats, Mr. Thomas sweetened Mr. Bush's proposals. 
 His bill would accelerate the president's plan to drop the lowest income tax rate to 10 percent from 15 percent and make that reduction retroactive. The rate would drop to 12 percent on the first $12,000 of taxable income for couples beginning Jan. 1 of this year. It would fall to 10 percent by 2006 when all the rates reductions will be fully phased in.
Republicans put the tax bill on a quick timetable in the House, a move that allows Mr. Bush to step up pressure on Democrats and on the Senate, where the tax cut is a harder sell. Republicans said the cost of the bill would be about $65 billion more than Mr. Bush's own proposal across 10 years. But Mr. Thomas said that there would still be "ample room" to enact the remaining features of Mr. Bush's $1.6 trillion, 10-year tax cut. And he flatly predicted passage both in committee and in the House.
"The Ways and Means Committee will present and pass tomorrow a permanent rate-reduction bill," he said. "The House of Representatives will have done its part by the first week in March. The question then is, When will the Senate respond in kind?" 
But the tax cut still faced trouble in the Senate, which is split 50-50. "We still, as of today, have to be saying we don't have the votes yet," said Senator Pete V. Domenici, the New Mexico Republican who is chairman of the budget committee. "But I hope you will say 'yet' because we're working on it." 
And at a hearing of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator John B. Breaux, a conservative Democrat from Louisiana and a crucial vote for the president, told Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill that Congress was bound to make substantial changes in the president's $1.6 trillion proposal.
"This is what Congress does," Mr. Breaux said. "There will be a time that will come that people who want to get something done are going to have to negotiate."
With Democrats calling for the tax cut to be slowed down and tied to the broader debate over budget priorities, the Republicans framed the tax cut as a stimulus to the shaky economy on a day when the Federal Reserve Board chairman, Alan Greenspan, said the slowdown had yet to run its course.
Republicans accused Democrats in unusually pointed language of seeking bad times. "There are some people who would have it politically convenient to have a recession because that means they would have a political advantage," said Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois. "We are not going to let that happen."
And Mr. Thomas said of Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House Democratic leader, "I think the minority leader would be willing to discuss this all summer as the economy goes into the tank." 
Mr. Bush, who was stumping for his tax cut on the road, also spoke of the economy and Mr. Greenspan's warnings. "All the more reasons to accelerate the tax cut," he said. "and I think our nation needs to be wary of the economic times, and Congress needs to know that. Congress needs to work with me to accelerate a meaningful tax reduction package as quickly as possible."
The Democrats, bolstered by the release of an austere budget for 2002 that made outright cuts in 10 federal agencies in a time of surplus, said the nation could not afford a tax cut that would limit money for other needs. They accused the Republicans of trying to obscure the tradeoffs by moving fast. 
"We are spending money we don't have, and Democrats will not be a party to it," Mr. Gephardt said. He called the last years of prosperity a "golden period" and said that was why he was fighting so hard against the change in fiscal policy. "We are going to fight this thing because it has enormous consequences for the American people," he said.
Sounding the same themes, Senator Tom Daschle, Democrat of South Dakota, the minority leader, said, "This budget has a single-minded focus on oversized tax cuts, to the exclusion of almost everything else Americans care about."
The Republicans' speed left the Democrats scrambling to complete a Democratic alternative and to assess the firmness of their own members. Representative David Bonior of Michigan, the House minority whip, said he thought about 90 percent of House Democrats would oppose the Republican tax cut as too expensive when it came to the floor next week.
"I think people see the fact that a size-10 foot will not fit into a size 7 shoe," Mr. Bonior said. 
Mr. Gephardt said the Democrats' rate-cut package would be worth about $500 billion. Democratic aides said the party was looking to direct its tax reduction to lower and middle-income people by reducing the lowest 15 percent tax rate and expanding the earned-income tax credit, which would reduce the payroll tax liability of many families who are harder hit by the Social Security payroll tax than income taxes.
At a sometimes testy briefing, Mr. Bush's top three economics advisers defended his tax cut from accusations by Democrats that 43 percent of the tax reductions would go to the richest 1 percent of taxpayers.
"It's a nonsense set of statistics," said Mr. O'Neill, the treasury secretary. But the three administration officials separately refused to specify the benefit that they believed would flow to the top 1 percent of taxpayers.

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET: THE CUTS; 
Civil Works and Loans Targeted in Bush Plan

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 28 

 BODY:
President Bush's budget includes proposals to cut hundreds of millions of dollars for rural development, loan guarantees for small businesses, research on advanced technology, public housing and construction of the international space station.
 The cuts would affect programs at the Departments of Commerce, Agriculture, Energy and Transportation, as well as the Small Business Administration. 
 In addition, Mr. Bush's budget shows that he wants to slow the growth of Medicare, slicing about 5 percent from the amounts that would be spent under current law in the coming decade. He did not say how he would achieve those savings, other than to promise that he would "modernize and reform Medicare," the health insurance program for 39 million people who are elderly or disabled. 
While Mr. Bush did propose a substantial increase in spending for the Education Department, Democrats said it was a much smaller increase than Congress approved for the current year. By the administration's reckoning, the department's budget would rise 11.5 percent, to $44.5 billion in 2002, compared with an increase of 35.7 percent this year.
Mr. Bush's plans for cuts are often couched in dry, bureaucratic words, in contrast to the fiery language that Ronald Reagan used to attack federal spending in the early 1980's.
For example, President Bush said he wanted to terminate a program that combats drug-related crime in public housing because the program "was found to have limited impact." The money pays for security guards and police protection at housing projects. Mr. Bush said local housing authorities could achieve the same goal by simply evicting tenants who traffic in illicit drugs.
Mr. Bush would reduce the civil works budget of the United States Army Corps of Engineers by 13 percent, to $3.9 billion. The cuts may affect projects popular on Capitol Hill to dredge harbors, protect the environment and build sewage treatment plants.
One program that escaped cuts was the rail service of Amtrak. Mr. Bush requested $521 million for 2002, the same amount that Congress provided in December. But under his proposal, the money would be made available more rapidly next year, so Amtrak could buy and repair rail cars and improve its track.
William H. Schulz, a vice president of Amtrak, said, "Under the budget proposal, Amtrak would be able to meet more of its capital needs, reducing trip times and providing better service to passengers." Amtrak serves 45 states, but half of its riders are in the Northeast Corridor, from Washington to New England.
The president would freeze the Justice Department's budget, but cut its assistance to state and local law enforcement agencies. 
Several themes run through Mr. Bush's proposals. He asks Congress to reduce what he calls "corporate subsidies." He would temporarily halt spending on a Commerce Department program that provides money to private companies for research on advanced technology. He would curtail loan guarantees and subsidies for shipyards and the ship-building industry.
Mr. Bush would cut assistance to exporters provided by the Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation.
He said his purpose was to "reduce subsidies that primarily benefit corporations rather than individuals." Presidents and members of Congress of both parties have often railed against corporate welfare, with mixed success. 
Senator Christopher S. Bond, the Missouri Republican who is chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business, said he was "very concerned" about Mr. Bush's proposal to eliminate a program of loan guarantees for small businesses, which he said, "would not otherwise be able to obtain loans to support business expansion and new jobs."
Representative Nydia M. Velazquez of New York, the senior Democrat on the House Small Business Committee, said, "The new administration appears to be missing the point that small business is big business in America and is largely driving our economy."
President Bush said he wanted to reduce or eliminate a $45 million venture capital fund created last year to stimulate investment in economically depressed areas. President Bill Clinton and Speaker J. Dennis Hastert embraced the legislation, signed on Dec. 21, as a way to open new markets to American investors.
Experience suggests that Congress will reject some of these proposals, particularly those affecting small businesses. 
Another theme running through Mr. Bush's plan is a desire to remove funds for specific public works, highway projects and grants to colleges and hospitals that are already written into law. In recent years, Congress has become bolder in directing money to specific projects by name.
Mr. Bush said the government could save $4.3 billion next year by eliminating such earmarked items. Most of those projects were championed by lawmakers who are in Congress, many of whom sit on the powerful Appropriations Committees.

HEADLINE: Developer Is Picked for Queens Residential Project Across From U.N. 

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
A large riverfront site where Pepsi-Cola was bottled and canned until two years ago would be transformed into a residential enclave with more than 3,000 apartments in seven buildings, small parks and an esplanade, under a proposal chosen yesterday as part of the Queens West development project.
 But the $1 billion undertaking at the north end of Queens West will not spell an end to the giant red Pepsi-Cola sign that has blazed over the East River since 1936. 
 Under its deal to acquire the 21-acre parcel from PepsiCo, the Rockrose Development Corporation will re-erect the 60-by-100-foot sign on a new parking garage, facing the United Nations headquarters across the river as it does now. 
"We look at it as pop art," said Jon McMillan, director of planning for Rockrose. "If you could have asked Andy Warhol to design a piece of sculpture for a park, that's what he would have come up with." 
And that is not the only unusual aspect of the Rockrose proposal. To design the project, the company has commissioned Arquitectonica, best known for high-rise condominiums in Miami with sleek skins, swooping lines and bold geometric patterns. The firm also designed the hotel now being built at Eighth Avenue and 43rd Street, the Westin New York at Times Square. 
Rockrose was designated yesterday as developer of the Pepsi site by the Queens West Development Corporation, a subsidiary of the Empire State Development Corporation. The Queens West board includes representatives of the state, the city, the Queens borough president and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. A final deal is to be reached within 90 days.
While Pepsi owns more than a quarter of the 74-acre Queens West site, the state controls the development rights that permit large-scale construction in what is a low-rise manufacturing zone. So any prospective developer had to win over both sides simultaneously.
Since 1997, the only sign of Queens West on the skyline has been the 42-story Citylights co-op, built by M. O. Associates. But in December, AvalonBay Communities broke ground for the first of three new apartment buildings. A month later, LCOR was chosen as the developer of 2 million square feet of commercial space at the south end of Queens West.
"The project is moving very, very quickly," Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the state development corporation, said yesterday. "It wasn't too long ago that there were many large developers who said, 'We admire Gargano's enthusiasm, but we don't think Queens West is a project that's going to be built.' Right now, it's one of the most exciting development projects in New York City."
Rockrose competed for the Pepsi site with Time Equities and the Related Companies and was selected, Mr. Gargano said, because it offered a "superior financial deal."
K. Thomas Elghanayan, the president of Rockrose, said his company was acquainted with government-sponsored planned communities, having developed four buildings at Battery Park City. And, he said, it is prepared to weather the economic downturn that is virtually inevitable over the seven or eight years it will take to complete the project.
"We have the sitzfleisch for this kind of development," Mr. Elghanayan said yesterday. "We can sit there for a long time."
The Queens West project will seek to draw Manhattanites with river views at rents markedly less than they might expect to pay on the other side of the river -- say, $2,100 a month for an 800-square-foot apartment that would command $3,300 in Manhattan, Mr. Elghanayan said, 
It will be at least three years, however, before the first building opens, with 500 apartments. Rockrose plans to expand northward in phases, with 940 units in three buildings, followed by 725 units in two buildings and then 975 units in the last and largest building. 
None of the towers will be higher than Citylights, Mr. McMillan said.
While neighborhood opponents have long been concerned about the scale of Queens West, Councilman Walter L. McCaffrey, who represents the district, said yesterday that "the manner in which it is laid out can be done so that it's not something that becomes an oppressive mass."
The buildings will be arrayed along Center Boulevard, a gently curving street, with small parks on either side. An intermediate school will be included as part of the third phase of the project.
Under the deal, Rockrose is to buy the parcel from Pepsi for a price that Mr. Gargano put at $50 million. It will then give the land to the Queens West Development Corporation and lease it back for a nominal amount. Rockrose will also build the infrastructure: streets, utilities, parks and bulkhead. "We think we can do it faster and more efficiently," Mr. Elghanayan said, "and ultimately, it will cost less."
The most distinctive bit of infrastructure will surely be the Pepsi sign. The Pepsi-Cola Bottling Company of New York moved to Brooklyn and another site in Queens, but PepsiCo insisted that the sign had to stay if there was to be a deal.
"People who visit New York from all over the world have memories associated with that sign," said Larry Jabbonsky, a spokesman for Pepsi. "It was pivotal to our negotiations."

HEADLINE: International Partners Forming Firm to Invest in Europe 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN 

 BODY:
The private holding company of Bernard Arnault, the chairman and chief executive of LVMH-Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, is planning to announce today that it has formed a joint venture with TH Lee, Putnam Capital to create a European leveraged buyout firm that would also make other private investments.
 TH Lee, Putnam Capital is itself a joint venture between Thomas H. Lee Partners L.P. and Putnam Investments. The partnership is run by Thomas H. Lee, who is best known for buying the Snapple beverage business for $135 million in 1992 and selling it to the Quaker Oats Company for $1.7 billion two years later. Mr. Lee has just raised a $6.1 billion private equity fund, the largest ever. 
 The new venture is the latest involving leveraged buyout firms in the United States to set up outposts overseas. Many firms now say that Europe offers more opportunities than the United States. Private American equity firms bought 26 European companies in 2000, up from 7 in 1997, according to Thomson Financial Securities Data.
Mr. Arnault's holding company, Groupe Arnault, and TH Lee, Putnam Capital will begin assembling a team of about a dozen investment professionals for the joint venture, to be called TH Lee Groupe Arnault Partners. The venture will have offices in London, Paris and perhaps other sites and hopes to be making investments in European companies as early as this summer. The firm plans to focus on the financial sector, business and information services, telecommunications, media, and consumer products.
"Europe is an attractive market for private equity investing, as the integration of economies, markets and consumer preferences there continues at a rapid rate," Mr. Lee said in a statement, He added that the new venture would allow his American fund to "have a strategic and financial partner in Europe to broaden access to European companies." 
For Mr. Arnault, this is just his latest investment venture. Besides having, through Groupe Arnault, a controlling stake in Christian Dior S.A, which in turn controls LVMH- Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, he has invested $500 million in Europ@Web, an Internet investment firm and incubator. The results of his Internet investments have been mixed. He also has investments in telecommunications, media, technology and financial services, both in Europe and the United States.
"We have seen from firsthand experience the compelling investment opportunities available in Europe," Mr. Arnault said in the statement. He sought out Mr. Lee and TH Lee, Putnam Capital several months ago "in view of their outstanding record of identifying companies with exceptional growth potential, together with their demonstrated ability to help create value by strengthening management, increasing access to expansion capital and crafting appropriate and timely exit strategies."

HEADLINE: Senate Panel Approves Bill for Overhauling Bankruptcy Laws 

BYLINE:  By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 28 

 BODY:
A bill that would overhaul the nation's bankruptcy system and make it far more difficult for people to wipe out their debts passed an important hurdle today when it was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee and sent to the full Senate.
 Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware was the only Democrat to join Republicans in supporting the measure, which was adopted in the committee on a vote of 10 to 8. 
 A similar bill is expected to be adopted by the full House as early as Thursday, and President Bush has signaled that he will sign the bill if it reaches his desk. President Clinton vetoed similar legislation in his final weeks in office, saying it was too harsh on debtors. 
With Mr. Clinton's departure, consumer groups and others opposed to the overhaul said their best hope for stopping or altering the bill rested with Senate Democrats. 
In an early test of their influence in a Senate split 50-50, Democrats are expected to try to amend the bill substantially during the floor debate, which is expected to begin this week.
"It's a very harsh, very one-sided bill that spells big trouble for consumers," said Senator Paul Wellstone, a Minnesota Democrat who is a leading opponent of the bill and is expected to direct the floor fight.
Consumer groups and other opponents of the bill, which is being heavily promoted by lobbyists for the banking and credit card industries, have described it as potentially disastrous for workers who may be thrown out of their jobs if the economy continues to slow. 
They say it would also do nothing to stem the practices of banks and credit card companies that flood the mail with solicitations for easy, high-interest credit.
The bill's supporters say that it would end abuses of the bankruptcy system by debtors who can repay some of their loans. The legislation would disqualify many debtors from filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, which allows them to wipe out credit card debts and other unsecured loans, and force them into Chapter 13, which requires some repayment.
"Our current bankruptcy system is broken," said Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the Utah Republican who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee. "Under the current system, people with high incomes can run up massive debts and then use bankruptcy to get out of honoring them."
The number of personal bankruptcies reached a peak of 1.4 million in 1998, up from 718,000 at the beginning of the decade, but the number has dropped in each of the last two years. Last year, there were about 1.26 million bankruptcies.
Consumer groups have blamed banks and credit card companies for pushing many people into bankruptcy through aggressive marketing campaigns for high-interest loans.
A study released this week by the Consumer Federation of America showed that credit card companies mailed 2.5 billion solicitations for credit cards in the first three quarters of last year, which projected to 3.3 billion for the full year. That would reflect a 14 percent increase over the number mailed in 1999.
"Credit card issuers are brazenly lobbying for new bankruptcy restrictions at the same time their aggressive marketing and lending practices are pushing many families closer to the financial brink," said Travis Plunkett, the association's legislative director.
The bill passed the Judiciary Committee after the panel approved, on a voice vote, an amendment that would forbid companies entering bankruptcy from selling their customer lists in an effort to reimburse creditors.

 BODY:
Bush Proposes Framework For Tax Cut and Spending
President Bush proposed a $1.96 trillion federal budget for next year that would cut taxes and make room for his promised increases in spending on education, medical research and the military by scaling back corporate subsidies, health-care grants for poor communities and a host of other programs.
 Mr. Bush's tax and spending framework drew immediate attacks from Democrats. They said the budget would provide a tax-cut windfall to the wealthy while raiding money needed to keep Medicare healthy and requiring cuts elsewhere. Page A1.

HEADLINE: ART GUIDE 

 BODY:
 A selective listing by critics of The New York Times of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free. * denotes a highly recommended show.

Museums

* "ABCD: A COLLECTION OF ART BRUT," Museum of American Folk Art, 2 Lincoln Square, Columbus Avenue at 66th Street, Manhattan, (212) 977-7170 (through mid-July). Memorably vivid and widely abused, the phrase Art Brut (meaning raw or rough art) was coined in the 1940's by the French artist Jean Dubuffet. This exhibition, drawn from the holdings of a Paris-based foundation, attempts to reinstate his original meaning, revisiting the amazing pantheon of artists who inspired it and proposing some additions. Its many highlights include works by acknowledged greats like Adolf Wolfli, Aloise Corbaz, Henry Darger and Augustin Lesage, but the show also introduces many equally riveting artists unfamiliar to American audiences. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. Free (Roberta Smith).

* "AFRICAN FORMS," Museum for African Art, 593 Broadway, near Houston Street, SoHo, (212) 966-1313 (through Aug. 8). This show forgoes the figurative sculptures and masks that made African art a foundation of Western modernism to concentrate on supposedly humbler stuff, objects of physical adornment and daily use. With some 400 objects created by 156 ethnic groups, it proceeds in clusters of related carved wood neck rests, stools and boxes; ivory hairpins and snuff bottles; all kinds of jewelry; baskets and ceramic vessels; as well as spoons, weapons and musical instruments. The show is pervaded with elegance, economy of form and a sensitivity to materials that is both intensely spiritual and protomodern. Figurative sculpture and masks may be the "high art" of Africa, but there is no low. Hours: Tuesdays through Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; $2.50, students and 65+ (Smith).

* "COMMITTED TO THE IMAGE: CONTEMPORARY BLACK PHOTOGRAPHERS," Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through April 29). This sharply installed survey of 94 artists covers several decades of work, much of it by a generation of photographers who came of age in the 1960's and 70's. The pictures are sorted by broad themes (people, beauty, family, religion, etc.), and formal polish tends to predominate over conceptual grit. The terrain is, over all, unsensational ordinary life, with the heat now and then turned up high. Images of urban churchgoers, Louisiana sugar cane cutters, the magnetic Billie Holiday and children in African refugee camps sit side by side. The eclectic array has its share of bland entries, but there are dozens of wonderful artists here, and their collective spirit is persuasive. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 am. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m (to 11 p.m. first Saturday of each month). Admission: $4; $2, students and 62+ (Holland Cotter).

* "CORREGGIO AND PARMIGIANINO: MASTER DRAFTSMEN OF THE RENAISSANCE," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 879-5500 (through May 6). This copious and beautiful exhibition has nearly 130 drawings by two artists who were aligned in time, geography and, briefly, style in the third decade of the 16th century. Correggio, who blew the roof off Renaissance illusionism with the ecstatic ceiling paintings that he made in Parma in the 1520's, is represented by a room of exquisite mostly red-chalk studies that reflect a penchant for brazen foreshortening, glowing light and atmospheric sfumato; they also attest to a sensuousness that can seem more proto-Rococo than proto-Baroque. The two galleries of Parmigianino's drawings seem true to his Mannerist sensibility. A searching restlessness is evident in the constant shifts in medium, style and subject, the considerations of other artists' work (including Correggio's), the pensive self-portraits and portraits and, most of all, in several drawings that layer together unrelated motifs. So is a relatively new notion for his time: drawing for the sake of drawing. Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:15 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 8:45 p.m. Admission: $10; $5, students and 65+ (Smith).

"THE GLOBAL GUGGENHEIM: SELECTIONS FROM THE EXTENDED COLLECTION," Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500 (through April 22). Of the big permanent collection shows that have been taking up so much space, the Guggenheim's is the last. It's also the coolest, the prettiest, the least programmatic and the most conservative. Despite the "global" spin of the title, this is strictly a Euro-American affair. And thanks to the eye of the curator, Carmen Gimenez, it is a very beautiful one. The great Wright spiral feels freshly swept out; the bays are sparingly hung; and dozens of top-notch works, including a few from the Hermitage in St. Petersburg and Guggenheim branches abroad, have been paired and grouped to ignite free-associational sparks. Hours: Sundays through Wednesdays, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays, 9 am. to 8 p.m. Admission: $12; $8, students and 65+ (Cotter).

"MAJOR INTERSECTIONS," Yeshiva University Museum, 15 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 294-8330 (through April 1). The museum has a new downtown home in the Center for Jewish History, which it shares with four partners: the American Jewish Historical Society, the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research, the American Sephardi Federation and the Leo Baeck Institute. This show is drawn from the permanent collections of four of the five, and through paintings, books, manuscripts and ephemera evokes fascinating lives and overwhelming sweeps of history. A highlight is an 11th-century wooden Torah ark door from Egypt; it is believed to have come from the Ben Ezra synagogue in Cairo, where Maimonides once worshipped. Hours: Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Thursdays, 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $6; $4, students and 60+ (Cotter).

* PAUL McCARTHY, New Museum of Contemporary Art, 583 Broadway, near Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 219-1222 (through May 13). From his far-out position where the psychic security of Hollywood's packaging of sex and violence doesn't exist, Mr. McCarthy taps veins deep in the collective subconscious, way beyond where most shock artists have the audacity or intelligence to operate. A cultish presence on the Los Angeles art scene for years, his moment has finally come in New York with this retrospective and shows at Luhring, Augustine in Chelsea, Deitch Projects in SoHo and, in collaboration with the Public Art Fund, at the public atrium at 56th Street and Madison Avenue. We see an artist of wild highs and lows, of black comedy, cheap jokes, unspeakable actions, dry formalism and some real fiascos, the mark of an artist risking failure, a good sign. There is something beyond mere Pop parody or social provocation in the work, something to do with deep private needs and desires, which we perceive secondhand as comic pathos. It is art as tough therapy, disturbingly honest. Hours: Wednesdays and Sundays, noon to 6 p.m.; Thursdays through Saturdays, noon to 8 p.m. Admission: $6; $3, artists, students and 65+ (Michael Kimmelman).

* "NINETEENTH- AND 20TH-CENTURY CHINESE PAINTINGS FROM THE ROBERT H. ELLSWORTH COLLECTION, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 879-5500 (through Aug. 19). The 19th and 20th centuries were shattering times for China, bringing wars, civil violence and the fall of an empire. In art, old forms survived and flourished but also changed. This exhibition surveys how elite painting traditions developed for a new audience and under Western influences between 1850 and 1980. Among the highlights is a group of paintings by Qi Baishi (1864-1957), deservedly one of the most popular of all Chinese artists. The big news is that a major museum has quietly taken a firm stand on modern art in Asia, seeing it not as a postscript to a great tradition but as an integral, living part of the continuum. Hours and admission: See above (Cotter).

"THE OPULENT EYE OF ALEXANDER GIRARD," Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400 (through March 18). The first comprehensive look at the multifaceted work of the architect and designer. Girard's contribution to contemporary design was a free approach that incorporated all sorts of visual stimuli, from Italian stage sets to Mexican folk art to motifs from modern technology, making exuberant use of color, pattern, texture and ornament. In photographs, models and objects, the exhibition displays his fabrics, graphics, interiors, furniture, tableware, radio cabinets and much else. A whole room is devoted to the more than 300 fabric and wallpaper designs he created for the Herman Miller Furniture Company from the 1950's to the early 1970's with fresh patterns and colors that pushed the limits of middle-class taste. While Girard may not have been a heavyweight in American design, he was one of its liveliest figures. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Tuesdays until 9 p.m.; Sundays, noon to 5 p.m. Admission: $8; $3, students and 62+ (Grace Glueck).

* "PERFECTING MANKIND: EUGENICS AND PHOTOGRAPHY," International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 860-1777 (through March 18). A timely exercise wildly disproportionate in significance to its size, this one-room show tackles the complicated story of photography's supporting role in eugenics, the pseudo-science of human breeding. Via 19th-century composite portraits of Jews, snapshots of "Fitter Family" and "Perfect Baby" contest winners and early Nazi photographs of Aryans, we track the arc of eugenic popularity, an object lesson for our era of genetic engineering. And we see the dubious results of an unreflective faith in technological science, in this case the new technology of photography, which seemed at the time a reliable instrument of reason. Photographs, we are reminded by the exhibition, almost always say less than we think or want, and sometimes precious little except about our prejudices. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $8; $6, students and 62+ (Michael Kimmelman).

"JEAN POYET: ARTIST TO THE COURT OF RENAISSANCE FRANCE," Morgan Library, 29 East 36th Street, (212) 685-0610 (through May 6). His reputation as one of the great manuscript illuminators of the Renaissance has declined over the centuries, with much of his work ascribed to others, but the French artist Jean Poyet (ca. 1445-1503) is re-established in this beautiful show as the true author of a number of well-known Books of Hours and other religious treasures. His use of perspective, color, light and shadow and his convincing representations of the human figure took his work well beyond the limitations of his Late Gothic predecessors, as seen in such powerful manuscripts as the "Missal of Guillaume Lallemant" and "The Hours of Henry VIII." The judicious use of lightbox transparencies, blown-up color photographs and a CD-ROM room where viewers can turn the pages of virtual manuscripts makes the show more accessible. It is one of the season's most impressive presentations. Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Saturdays, 10:30 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $8; $6, students and 65+ (Glueck).

* CHARLOTTE SALOMON, Jewish Museum, 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200 (through March 25). Put aside as much as possible the grim death that has boxed Salomon, like Anne Frank, into the eye-glazing, inviolate category of Holocaust artist, a disservice to her. "Life? Or Theater?," her quasi-fictional diary of text and nearly 800 pictures cued to musical themes, will make you feel you are in good company while flattering your intelligence. The allusions are varied, the tone at times surprisingly light. Film was a big inspiration to Salomon. Images vary among close-ups, flashbacks, long shots and montage. She had an illustrator's gift for distillation and paraphrase. The result is a complex meditation on the connection between love and art. It is a coming-of-age story about a woman squeezing a whole life into one great gesture. Ultimately the energy counts most, a civilizing energy. "Take good care of it," Salomon told the man to whom she entrusted the work before she was shipped to Auschwitz. "It is my whole life." So it was. Hours: Sundays through Thursdays, 11 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Tuesdays to 8 p.m. Admission: $8; $5.50, students and 65+ (Kimmelman).

* "VAN GOGH'S POSTMAN: THE PORTRAITS OF JOSEPH ROULIN," Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400 (through May 15). This revelatory micro-exhibition reunites five portraits of the postal worker Joseph Roulin, whom van Gogh met while living in Arles in the south of France. The show affords an excellent opportunity to study the painter's craft as he processes a single motif through a series of approaches from painterly naturalism to richly patterned symbolism. It is fascinating as well to see the portraits in light of the biographical background. Roulin cared for van Gogh after the famous ear-cutting incident, and he grew in the artist's imagination from an amusing local character to a figure of Christ-like benevolence. Hours: Thursdays through Tuesdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; to 8:15 p.m. on Fridays. Admission: $10; $6.50, students and 65+ (Ken Johnson).

"ANDY WARHOL: PHOTOGRAPHY," International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 860-1777 (through March 18). When Warhol died in 1987, he left some 100,000 photographs in the form of prints, contact sheets and negatives. This exhibition is the first major examination of this material and focuses on its relationship to Warhol's photo-based paintings, early and late. Taken strictly as a display of photographs, the show feels a little thin, mostly because his output in the medium was almost willfully insubstantial. But as a fresh take on his hugely influential work and complex personality, the results are entertaining and sometimes revealing. Included is one of his "time capsules," cardboard boxes that he periodically filled with the material clutter of his life, then sealed, dated and stored away. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $8; $6, students and 62+ (Cotter).

Galleries: Uptown

RICHARD NONAS, "Sophia Maria and the Indians," Lawrence Markey, 42 East 76th Street, (212) 517-9892 (through March 10). Carefully placed in this gallery's square white room, the simple, rough-hewn wooden sculptures by a veteran Minimalist create a slowed-down, contemplative ambience. An inclined plane of heavy beams; a saw-tooth pattern cut into a thick plank; an X shape made of intersecting blocks: these Brancusian objects encourage a calming attention to elemental facts of light, space and structure (Johnson).

* "WOMEN DESIGNERS IN THE U.S.A., 1900-2000: DIVERSITY AND DIFFERENCE," Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, 18 West 86th Street, (212) 501-3000 (through April 8). At the turn of the 20th century, female designers were mostly white, middle-class and skilled in "female" pursuits; today their ethnicity is widely diversified, and they have made enormous progress in fields once open only to men. Architecture, landscaping, interiors, furniture, textiles, apparel, posters, tableware, wallpaper, ceramics, lighting, jewelry, floor coverings, silverware, doors for cars, costumes and industrial products are represented in this bountiful show, which shoehorns some 220 objects into three floors of tight gallery space. Work by American Indians and African-Americans is given special attention (Glueck).

Galleries: 57th Street

"A WINTER GROUP OF ARTIST COUPLES," Katharina Rich Perlow, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 644-7171 (through March 10). It is not a new idea, but it is always interesting to compare works by two artists who are (or were) a couple. This 22-artist show includes Abstract Expressionist paintings by James Brooks and Charlotte Parks; a squiggly drawing and a slashing painting by Willem de Kooning and Elaine de Kooning, respectively; and an elegant Constructivist-style drawing by Joel Shapiro with a delicately misty painting of a blue vase by Ellen Phelan (Johnson).

* OSKAR KOKOSCHKA, "Memorial Exhibition," Marlborough Gallery, 40 West 57th Street, (212) 541-4900 (through March 17). Throughout this show, we are reminded that in everything he did Kokoschka, who died in 1980 at age 93, gave his whole self, without evasion and without stint. It begins with his portraits of the composers Webern (1914) and Schoenberg (1925); continues with his big cityscapes, with their attention to telling detail; and makes a strong case for his late watercolors, in which the image is briskly defined and the color has an irresistible energy. This hand never shook (John Russell).

* "OUR BEAUTIFUL AND TORMENTED AUSTRIA: ART BRUT IN THE LAND OF FREUD," Galerie St. Etienne, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 245-6734 (through March 17). This extraordinary show introduces the recently discovered work of two self-taught Viennese artists: Emanuel Navratil (1875-1956), who made large color-pencil drawings that transform his native city into a magical kingdom of fantasy architecture, intricate pattern and bourgeois contentment; and Josef Karl Radler (1844-1917), a retired porcelain painter whose fusions of writing and painting infuse scenes of the hospital where he spent his final years with a power akin to illuminated manuscripts (Smith).

Galleries: SoHo

"HANDS ACROSS THE SEA," Phyllis Kind Gallery, 136 Greene Street, (212) 925-1200 (through March 15). Arranged in a series of telling, often surprising comparisons between American and European self-taught artists, this exhibition demonstrates that there is plenty of reason to stretch Jean Dubuffet's original definition of Art Brut beyond its original European perimeters (Smith).

ROBERT SCHMID, Sears-Peyton, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 966-7469 (through March 31). With sensitive, assiduous craft, Mr. Schmid paints small-scale copies of blurred, smeared, double-exposed or otherwise distorted snapshots of people, city streets and natural landscapes, which were taken with a defective camera. He organizes these images into gridded compositions that have a moody cinematic quality (Johnson).

Galleries: Chelsea

BILL OWENS, Paul Morris, 465 West 23rd Street, (212) 727-2752 (through March 10). Mr. Owens published his famous and enthralling book "Suburbia" in 1973, but he continued his sharp-eyed documentation of suburban culture into the early 80's. This show presents large color prints from the series, including the images of a pretty young woman with big hair snorting coke in a restroom and a beautiful picture of a swimming pool titled "Hockney Painted This Pool" (Johnson).

"POETRY PLASTIQUE," Marianne Boesky Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 680-9889 (through March 10). Art and poetry: made for each other. Poets write about art; artists turn to poetry for ideas. Sometimes the two disciplines meet in collaboration. Such meetings are the subject of this show, in which image and word are flexibly intertwined. Organized by the poet Charles Bernstein and Jay Sanders, it covers a stretch of recent historical ground, from word-peppered Blakean drawings by Robert Smithson from 1962 to work by Mira Schor, Richard Tuttle and Susan Bee from last year. When the gallery was host to a series of related panel discussions and readings, the buzz of voices and ideas made the art feel alive and interactive. Some of the pieces really need that charge; others do fine on their own. Certainly the cross-disciplinary concept behind the show is ripe for further exploration (Cotter).

"THEM!" Jay Grimm, 505 West 28th Street, (212) 564-7662 (through March 17). The most interesting items in this curiously didactic show about some of our least favorite animals are not artworks but actual exotic insects collected, mounted and framed by Bob Natalini. Otherwise, there are round photographic portraits of ants by Bill Scanga; nice washy watercolors of a praying mantis and a ladybug by Emilie Clark; and Shane Hope's strange, funky miniature assemblages with insectoid elements emerging from the gallery's electrical receptacles (Johnson).

Other Galleries

SARAH BEDFORD, JEANNE LORENZ AND AMY WILSON, Bellwether Gallery, 150 Franklin Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 389-3213 (through March 11). The unstated theme of this show is Americana gone decorously amok. Ms. Bedford's collagelike bad-dream visions of bugs, plants, geometric patterns and Currier and Ives sleigh rides are the most elaborate entries. Ms. Lorenz, in large grisaille watercolors, transforms winsome porcelain figurines from e-Bay auctions into bug-eyed mutants. Ms. Wilson also works in watercolor. In paintings the size of pages in children's books, she uses pleasing colors, draftsmanly finesse and wide-ranging research to chart the sinister inner workings of the military-industrial complex (Cotter).

Last Chance

"CONTEXT: MEXICO'S TALLER DE GRAFICA POPULAR AND ITS LEGACY," Bronx Museum of the Arts, 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania, (718) 681-6000 (through Sunday). The Taller was established in Mexico City in 1937 to create a national art that would be accessible to the common man, and its utopian goals have inspired generations of Chicano and Puerto Rican artists. This small show, installed in the museum's permanent collection gallery, includes work by founding members of the Taller like Leopoldo Mendez and Pablo O'Higgins plus contemporary successors like Luis Jimenez, Rafael Tufino and Ester Hernandez. Hours: Wednesdays, noon to 9 p.m; Thursdays through Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $3; $2, students and 65+ (Cotter).

"LEONARDO DREW," Bronx Museum of the Arts, 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania, (718) 681-6000 (through Sunday). The large-scale two-part wall here continues a theme for which Mr. Drew is noted: subtly gridded three-dimensional compositions made of distressed wood, stacked boxes and various other materials, then coated with rust to simulate the encroachments of time and nature. The walls and the castoff objects they contain have an aura of gritty poverty, evoking hard times and marginal lives. But they also make high-art connections: the allover and actively layered surfaces alluding to Abstract Expressionism, the grids evoking the rigorous formalism of geometric abstraction. In the nine years since his first New York solo show, Mr. Drew's voice has not lost its eloquence, although the work has lost the fresh rawness that gave it its initial impact. Hours and admission: See above. (Glueck).

JAYNE HOLSINGER, "American Stills," Margaret Thatcher, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 675-0222 (through tomorrow). This New York-based painter's small panel paintings -- based on family snapshots taken on a trip home to the Midwest -- are formally nondescript. But they are deftly made and convey a quietly touching affection for middle America, not an attitude frequently encountered in Chelsea galleries (Johnson).

"INTIMATE FRIENDS: THOMAS COLE, ASHER B. DURAND AND WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT," New-York Historical Society, 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, (212) 873-3400 (through Sunday). The painters Cole (1801-1848) and Durand (1796-1886) and the poet Bryant (1794-1878) shared a close friendship, based in part on a vision of nature as a moral and spiritual force. Bryant sang its praises in poetry; Cole and Durand, founders of the Hudson River School, paid tribute in art. This show of paintings, drawings, manuscripts and periodicals from the society's own holdings celebrates the spiritual kinship of the trio, and lays out the notions about nature and civilization, Europe and America that involved them in long-term dialogue. Its centerpiece is Cole's five-part painting cycle, "The Course of Empire" (1836-38), an allegorical account of the rise and fall of an ancient classical civilization. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission: $5; $3, students 12+ and 65+ (Glueck).

PHILLIP KING, Garth Clark, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 246-2205 (through tomorrow). This English artist has a heavyweight title, president of the Royal Academy of Art in London, but his sculpture has always had a lighthearted way with form and metaphor. In the five large natural-color ceramic works on view here, Mr. King playfully abstracts traditional vessel forms, producing a witty, slightly surrealistic Neo-Classical Cubism (Johnson).

ROBERT LONGO, "The Freud Drawings," Metro Pictures, 519 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-7100 (through tomorrow). Mr. Longo's monumental charcoal drawings are based on photographs of Sigmund Freud's home in 1938, shortly before he fled to London. They are competently made with strong contrasts between velvety blacks and glaring whites; if they are compelling, however, it is because they trigger highly charged associations. Thus, through the spiritually cheap act of appropriation, the artist lays claim to an unearned moral profundity (Johnson).

* NINO MIGLIORI, "Neo-Realismo: Scenes of Life in Postwar Italy," Keith de Lellis Gallery, 47 East 68th Street, (212) 327-1482 (through tomorrow). Making you feel the camera wasn't there was one of the great attributes of the postwar Italian neo-Realist films like "Shoeshine" and "The Bicycle Thief." You tend to dismiss the artful camera, too, in Mr. Migliori's black-and-white stills, taken in the north and south of Italy from 1952 to 1959. Inspired by the great neo-Realist film directors, Mr. Migliori captured what might be called Italian quintessences in images that range from three pairs of women's white shoes clicking smartly along a sidewalk to a couple of monks playing volleyball, their long robes billowing about them (Glueck).

LARRY POONS, Salander-O'Reilly, 20 East 79th Street, (212) 879-6606 (through tomorrow). Painted in bright cotton-candy colors over surfaces enhanced by glued-on foam rubber, Mr. Poons's new paintings are swarming mindscapes populated by curious symbolic forms: spheres with Saturnine rings, pyramids, stars, ellipses and even mathematical notations. They have a kind of clumsy rawness of draftsmanship that suggests the work of a self-taught visionary. What they mean to the artist is hard to say, but they offer a fresh combination of terrestrial funk and cosmic exuberance (Johnson).

JOSHUA STERN, Parker's Box, 193 Grand Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 388-2882 (through Sunday). This is the first one-person show for a smart six-month-old gallery, and Mr. Stern's big photographs of sculptural heads are, in their bizarre way, suitably imposing fare for the occasion. They stare down from the walls like life-size family portraits, but who would would claim these cartoonish, pocked-skinned creatures as relatives? Actually, Mr. Stern has created something very grand from something very modest: the photographs are of tiny heads that the artist molded from chewed drinking straw wrappings; the sculptures themselves can be found on a little shelf in the back (Cotter).

BILLY SULLIVAN, "My World," Fischbach, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 759-2345 (through tomorrow). In Mr. Sullivan's luminous painted world it seems as though people are always on summer vacation, enjoying sunlit oceanside spaces indoors and out. In his best pictures, which look like watercolors even when painted with oils, he combines seemingly effortless snapshot-based draftsmanship and pastel colors to portray people at play or in states of enviable ease. Yet one cannot help wondering what darkness is hidden by such a determinedly hedonistic vision (Johnson).

HEADLINE: Stocks in Japan at 15-Year Low 

BYLINE:  By MIKI TANIKAWA 

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 1 

 BODY:
Snubbing the Bank of Japan and the interest rate cut it announced yesterday, investors hammered Japanese stocks downward again today, with the benchmark Nikkei 225-stock index falling 1.57 percent, to 12,681.66, its lowest close in more than 15 years.
 The relentless decline in share prices in recent days is an embarrassing blow to the governor of the bank, Masaru Hayami, who declared in August that the Japanese economy was healthy enough to withstand higher interest rates. Over a storm of objections from political leaders, the Bank of Japan, the country's central bank, then raised its overnight call rate, the interest banks charge each other, to 0.25 percent from near zero. 
 Now, Mr. Hayami finds himself having to unwind the policy: yesterday's move lowered the call rate to 0.15 percent, after the largely symbolic discount rate, the interest the central bank charges for its loans to banks, was trimmed on Feb. 9.
Electronics stocks were among the hardest hit today, in part because of the continuing weakness in Nasdaq trading in the United States. Matsushita Electric Industrial fell 6.79 percent today; NEC fell 4.19 percent and Sony, 2.72 percent. Bond prices rose as investors sought a haven, pushing the yield on the benchmark 10-year government bond to its lowest level in more than two years, 1.210 percent.
Analysts said the bank's reversal of course on interest rates was insufficient to counteract dismal figures on industrial production in January that came out on the same day.
"The market felt something had to be done," said Yoshikazu Takao, managing director at Asahi Life Asset Management in Tokyo. "Without it, the market would have suffered even a greater decline."
Instead of "doling out policy in such a piecemeal fashion," in Mr. Takao's phrase, he and other analysts said the bank needed to regain the confidence of the markets by setting aside questions of pride and face-saving and wholeheartedly moving to ease monetary policy, by cutting the overnight call rate to zero and other measures.

HEADLINE: Factory Index and Spending Show a Bit of a Rebound 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 1 

 BODY:
A gauge of manufacturing rose last month for the first time in a year, and consumer spending in January was the strongest in four months, two reports showed today, indicating that the economy may be turning around.
 The National Association of Purchasing Management's factory index rose to 41.9 last month from 41.2 in January, breaking a string of 11 consecutive declines. Personal spending on goods and services rose 0.7 percent in January as consumers bought more automobiles, the Commerce Department said. 
 "The hemorrhaging may have stopped," said Richard Yamarone, senior economist at the Argus Research Corporation in New York. Still, "it'll be slow going for the next four or five months."
A reading below 50 in the manufacturing index signals a contraction at factories, and the index has not been above that point since July of last year. That is why investors are betting the Federal Reserve will cut its benchmark interest rate a half percentage point at its March 20 meeting to keep the economic expansion going.
The Commerce Department showed an increase of 0.7 percent in January spending on goods and services. That was up from a 0.4 percent gain in December and the biggest rise since a 0.9 percent rise in September. The report also showed a 0.6 percent increase in January incomes after a 0.4 percent rise a month earlier.
Construction spending rose 1.5 percent in January, the biggest rise since a 1.7 percent jump in March 2000, led by more work on single-family homes, the Commerce Department reported.
The February new-orders component of the manufacturing index rose to 40.8 from 37.8 in January, signaling manufacturing may improve in coming months. It is "excellent news to see some bottoming in the new- orders component," said Steven Wieting, an economist at Salomon Smith Barney Inc. in New York. "This is one of the things that could stabilize the rest of the economy."
New orders carry the greatest weight and account for 30 percent of the overall index. The purchasing management association's production index rose to 39.7 from 37.9 in January. The report also showed inflation was less of a concern for manufacturers. An index of prices paid for raw materials fell to 58.1 in February from 65.7.
Fed policy makers say that manufacturing is mainly responsible for the economic slowdown as production cuts whittle away at excess inventory that accumulated amid slowing demand.
"I think the prospects that this is primarily an inventory correction centered in manufacturing is pretty high," J. Alfred Broaddus Jr., the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., said last month.
The association's employment index, a gauge of hiring plans and labor market conditions accounting for 20 percent of the index, fell to 37.2 in February from 43 in January. The index has fallen for five consecutive months, the first time that has happened since April to August of 1973.
Separately, the Labor Department reported initial jobless claims rose by 39,000, to a level of 372,000 last week, the highest this year.

HEADLINE: Slightly Shaken, Briefly Shocked, Then Back to Mellow as Usual 

BYLINE:  By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: SEATTLE, March 1 

 BODY:
Lori Brogan knows an earthquake when she feels one. A former Californian, she lived through serious quakes in Los Angeles in 1971 and 1994. So when the tall, two-story walls started wobbling back and forth in the Seattle Shirt Company on Wednesday morning, Ms. Brogan ran to stand under the doorjamb of the stockroom.
 "I was shocked," said Ms. Brogan, 33, who manages Seattle Shirt, a T-shirt emporium across the street from the Pike Place Market downtown. "I just stood there and thought, 'This is it.' " 
 So it was, and yet it was not. By this morning, Ms. Brogan's shop had already sold out of its first batch of celebratory "I Survived the Earthquake in Seattle" shirts in bold red and black letters, and the mood of this waterfront capital of coffee and mellow was settling into a kind of grateful astonishment that it had, in fact, endured the region's worst earthquake in a half-century with perhaps $2 billion in property damage but few serious injuries.
"Shaken, but OK," read the bold banner headline of The Seattle Times. The headline of the lead editorial was more pointed in a city sometimes stereotyped as smug: "Shaken From Complacency."
In fact, some locals said the earthquake seemed simply the culmination of a run of atypical bad news here, from the recent dot.com contraction to the violent protests at the World Trade Organization meeting in 1999 to a Mardi Gras celebration that turned violent and left 71 people injured and one dead after midnight Tuesday, just hours before the earthquake struck.
Even an unusually sunny spate of winter weather has left mountain snowpack and vital hydroelectric capacity below normal, and made Seattle feel more like Southern California. But this afternoon, a steady rain and soupy fog arrived as the sort of calming benediction that a rainbow might represent in clearer climes.
"It was a pretty startling experience, obviously, but I guess the shorthand on Seattle is that we're shaken but not stirred," said Walt Crowley, a local author and executive director of a Web site on Seattle history, historylink.org. "There's no panic in the streets, and in fact, the Fat Tuesday violence is probably a more disturbing event in its way." 
Mr. Crowley and his colleagues were updating their site when the quake struck and made fresh history. "Some bookshelves toppled over, but we stayed online," he said. 
Paul A. Toliver, the director of the King County Department of Transportation, was holding a staff meeting when the quake hit.
"We did quite well," Mr. Toliver said. "I actually moved here from San Francisco, but this was the worst I ever felt." 
Today, before heading to a meeting on quake damage with Joe Allbaugh, the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Mr. Toliver took souvenir snapshots of the damage to the Fenix Underground tavern across the street from his office near Pioneer Square. 
The area, the scene of the Mardi Gras violence, is full of older, low-rise brick buildings, and was one of the places hardest hit. Today red and yellow police tape blocked off streets littered with bricks, crumbled mortar and broken glass.
Because the city emerged so relatively unscathed, merchants felt free to make fun. The Four Seasons Hotel featured upside-down cake, breakfast "panquakes" and seismic martinis (shaken, of course), while the Pike & Western Wine Shop downtown had a blackboard sign on the sidewalk that asked passersby, "What to drink after an earthquake?" and answered, "Anything."
And residents seemed disinclined to complain openly. "I am so sick of this city, it's just too much," a clerk in the wine shop was saying when a reporter entered this morning, but she quickly fell silent when he identified himself, and a co-worker, Peter Schmalzer, cheerily announced that the store had lost only about two dozen bottles, mostly tippy half-bottles of dessert wine, out of the thousands racked on its shelves.
"I got to tell you," Mr. Schmalzer added, "they were all shaking. I was just getting ready for them to go."
To be sure, glass objects fell, plenty of them, including expensive vases at the Vetri International Glass gallery, on First Avenue downtown, which together with its upstairs parent, the William Traver Gallery, is a leading dealer for Seattle's renowned studio glass industry. 
Mr. Traver estimated his losses at something like $300,000.
"It looks very clean now," Vetri's director, Heather Eslien, said this morning, as she rearranged a rainbow assortment of handblown goblets and glassware and gestured to a straw broom propped in the corner that had been busy for hours. "But it was really pretty messy yesterday. Everything just kind of swayed back and forth."
At the venerable Eliott Bay Book Company off Pioneer Square, perhaps 1,000 volumes, mostly current hardback fiction, fell off the shelves as the staff ran out in the street to escape the shaking, one clerk, David Hsieh, recalled today.
"I was downstairs in the cafe, and it suddenly sounded like a big train was going by on the street, which doesn't happen" Mr. Hsieh said. 
"It's incredible that more people weren't hurt."
Whatever the digital economy's troubles, it was ready for a digital-age earthquake, and by midafternoon today the online auction site eBay already featured 32 Seattle quake-related items, including an assortment of "debris, shaken earth and crushed vehicle remains" offered by Ian Maddox of Seattle, who usually sells computers and parts on the site.
"I found lots of bricks and whatnot demolished from a building downtown," said Mr. Maddox, who had drawn a top bid of $1.25 after two bidders, with 6 days remaining in the auction. "And I figured, Why not?"

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate; 
New Rochelle Skyline Now Has a Skyscraper

BYLINE:  By NADINE BROZAN 

 BODY:
From almost any vantage point in New Rochelle, N.Y., the new apartment building almost complete at 255 Huguenot Street stands tall, its 25 stories slicing into the horizon, visible everywhere. 
 "Coming back from Montauk last summer," said New Rochelle's mayor, Timothy C. Idoni, "I got on the Cross Island Parkway just west of Glen Cove and noticed the impressive orange steel structure reaching into the sky. Suddenly I realized: that's New Rochelle." 
 The tallest structure in New Rochelle, the building is known as Avalon on the Sound. It marks the increasing concentration by AvalonBay Communities Inc., the development and management company, on the high-rise market. 
"This is a newer business for us," said Fred Harris, a vice president of development for the company in the New York metropolitan region. "Our existing portfolio is overwhelmingly garden apartment communities. But we are increasingly interested in urban infill locations with access to jobs, transportation and entertainment. Our market is renters by choice: people who rent because they want to, not because they can't afford to buy."
The company owns 136 complexes, or, as it prefers to call them, communities, containing 40,041 apartments in 12 states and the District of Columbia. In New York, New Jersey and Connecticut it has 29 communities, with a total of 10,102 apartments. Last winter it began construction of the first phase of Avalon Riverview, the three-building cluster it is putting up in the Queens West project in Long Island City. 
In New Rochelle, the first occupants of Avalon on the Sound are scheduled to move in next month.
The rental office had more than 1,000 inquiries even before it opened last week, said Robert Paley, senior development officer with AvalonBay Communities.
The original plan called for the construction of three buildings, one of them across Huguenot Street next to the New Rochelle Public Library. But the first building, which contains 412 apartments, has been so successful, he said, that Avalon scratched the third phase and expanded the second building to 600 units.
The first building cost $92 million, "about the same as it would have in Manhattan," Mr. Paley said. The City of New Rochelle, which owned the 2.4-acre site, gave AvalonBay Communities a 30-year tax deferral. In return, AvalonBay will pay the city a percentage of its annual operating income from the property, according to a spokesman for the company. Financing is being done through Fleet Bank. 
When complete, the building, in a rounded L-shape, will contain 41 studios (rent: $1,285 to $1,405), 144 one-bedroom apartments ($1,605 to $1,980), 185 two-bedrooms ($2,140 to $2,850) and 41 three-bedrooms ($2,815 to $3,435). They all bear the names of America's Cup boats, reflecting the location. 
Light and airy with views of the library and of the Sound -- which is actually about three-quarters of a mile away -- the units all have kitchens opening onto living-dining rooms, walk-in closets, and, with the exception of the studios, washers and dryers.
Communal amenities will include a 52-foot-long heated outdoor swimming pool that will be surrounded by decorative columns, with nearby barbecue grills and picnic tables.
Inside there is a club room with a fireplace, bar and kitchen that can be used by residents for parties. There is also a fitness center with exercise machines, a basketball court and a gym, a business center and a laundry room, all open 24 hours.
But what attracted Stanley and Mary Jane Lee, who now live on the Upper East Side and who have signed a leasefor a one-bedroom unit, more than anything else was the location. The Metro-North station is directly outside the rear door. (Insulation has been installed in the concrete block walls to shut out the sound of passing trains.) 
Stanley Lee, 32, is a dentist with a practice in New Haven and a commute that, he said, ranges from an hour and a half in the morning to three hours in the evening. His wife, 25, is a lawyer with an office in Midtown Manhattan. 
"We had been looking for a compromise, for about a year," Dr. Lee said. "In my drive I noticed the building, a big orange skeleton from I-95. I didn't even know how close to the train station and convenient to the highway it is."
To Mayor Idoni, Avalon on the Sound has become one more emblem of the renaissance of New Rochelle's downtown area after decades of retail and residential depression. 
Though its size is notable, there was never opposition to it as there was to the proposed Ikea superstore, plans for which were abandoned in February. 
"The residents of New Rochelle realized we had to do something dramatic to bring the business district back," Mr. Idoni said, and that meant a large residential development to bring dollars into the local economy. New Roc City, a $190 million complex with numerous athletic and entertainment facilities including two ice rinks, a bowling alley, a batting cage, video arcade and 18 movie screens, is two blocks away. 
The closest neighbor to Avalon on the Sound is Trinity-St. Paul's Episcopal Church, a 19th-century neo-Gothic structure that could not offer a more startling architectural contrast.
But, in the view of the Rev. Clair McPherson, the rector of the church, which was founded more than 300 years ago, the two structures complement one another rather than clash. "I think aesthetically it will be a better harmonization than many things I see in Manhattan," he said. "The two styles may be very different but they are compatible. There is something about a church spire that gives a feeling of tallness. "

HEADLINE: State Agency Sues to Claim Rights to Battery Park Site 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
The Battery Park City Authority and a major New York developer are wrestling over one of the last major development sites in Lower Manhattan.
 The authority, the state agency that controls the 92-acre Battery Park City, has sought for several years to sell the right to build a 1.8-million-square-foot skyscraper on a vacant parcel at the north end of the complex. But the developer, John E. Zuccotti, has told public officials and rival builders that his Brookfield Financial Properties has the exclusive right to develop the site on West Street, between Vesey and Murray Streets. 
 The long-simmering battle became public yesterday, after the authority filed a lawsuit in State Supreme Court asking that Brookfield be barred from continuing to interfere with the authority's plans by invoking rights that "simply do not exist." These false claims, the agency said, could drive down the sale price, or scare off bidders who fear becoming entangled in a lawsuit by Brookfield.
At stake is a valuable chunk of real estate and a sale price that could exceed $100 million. But the value of the property could decline if there is a long delay and a recession.
"We consider this parcel an enormously valuable property," said James F. Gill, chairman of the authority. "We have a fiduciary duty to get the most we can for it. But people may not bid, or may bid less, because of the existence of this claim.
"Brookfield's playing a card that they think is a queen," he added. "I think they have a three or four."
Brookfield disagreed, saying it obtained control over commercial development at Battery Park City in the 1980's with the development of the World Financial Center, a complex of four large office towers that are home to American Express, Merrill Lynch and other companies.
Brookfield succeeded the original builder as manager of the World Financial Center and three of the four towers.
"We obtained certain rights affecting future commercial development at Battery Park City as a central part of the agreement to construct the World Financial Center," said Rick Matthews, a spokesman for the developer. "Brookfield continues to hold these rights and is confident that its position will be sustained through adjudication."
Battery Park City itself was built on landfill along the Hudson River 30 years ago. The complex includes more than 4,900 apartments, hotels, 30 acres of parks, an esplanade, schools and museums, as well as the eight-million-square-foot World Financial Center.
Only a few undeveloped parcels are left. The authority has wanted for some time to sell the development rights for the parcel now in dispute.
"There has been a question mark hanging over this site for years," said Stephen B. Siegel, chairman of Insignia/ESG, a real estate brokerage company. "Clearing it up will make it much easier to get a transaction done."
In 1998, Jerry I. Speyer, the developer, and Nasdaq, the electronic stock market, had considered building new Nasdaq headquarters on the site. Brookfield declared at the time that it was the only developer that could build on the site, much to the authority's chagrin.
The two sides appeared close to a resolution later that year, when Brookfield explored building new headquarters on that land for Chase Manhattan Bank, which was considering a merger with Merrill Lynch. But like the Nasdaq proposal, nothing came of it.
"There's no animosity here," Mr. Gill said. "I've got a good relationship with John Zuccotti. The court will decide whether he has a claim."

American consumers continued to flock to car dealerships in February despite the economic slowdown, producing another unexpectedly strong month for auto sales.
 Sales fell 6 percent last month from February 2000, but the year-earlier month had been one of the best in the industry's history because of lavish incentives. The seasonally adjusted annual rate of sales last month was 17.5 million vehicles, in an industry that considers anything above 16 million vehicles to be an excellent month. 
 "I don't think anyone was expecting it to be much above 16" million, said Haig Stoddard, the manager of industry analysis at Ward's Automotive, an auto industry data service in Southfield, Mich. "People I've talked to are at a loss -- if you look at how the economy is going, it's not making sense." 
The automakers' sales executives acknowledged that they, too, were somewhat mystified, but suggested three explanations for the market's remaining strong even as consumer confidence has plunged.
Rebates and other discounts became slightly more widespread last month than in January and were heavily advertised, especially by Chrysler. General Motors and especially Ford Motor increased somewhat their reliance on low-profit shipments to corporate and rental fleets. And vehicles remained fairly affordable last month, having barely risen in price over the last four years, excluding the addition of new options, even as incomes have climbed swiftly in recent years for the affluent families who buy most of the new cars and light trucks these days.
Brisk sales in February, combined with slower shipments from factories, helped car dealers clear lots that had become crammed with unsold vehicles earlier this winter.
General Motors said it had an 87-day inventory of unsold vehicles as of Wednesday, and Ford said its inventory was down to 80 days. The Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler A.G. had just a 58-day supply, its lowest since July 1999.
The auto industry considers a 60-day supply to be ideal, so as to offer a range of colors and options at each dealership. Foreign automakers had manageable inventories even before February.
"We're taking a hard look at putting some production back in," said Jamie Jameson, the vice president for marketing and sales at Chrysler, which has been particularly aggressive in shuttering factories for a week or two at a time and furloughing the workers. The company is proceeding with long-term white-collar and blue-collar layoffs, however.
Ford announced today that it hoped to keep its factories running throughout the second quarter, after shuttering most of them for a week or two at a time earlier this year. Ford's output in the second quarter will be down only 5 percent from last year, because few if any factories will run on overtime, said George Pipas, a Ford market analyst.
G.M. was more cautious, setting a production schedule for the second quarter that calls for making 17 percent fewer automobiles than during the second quarter of last year, when many factories were operating with maximum overtime.
The company has already begun notifying workers at some factories that assembly lines will be slowed and that hundreds of workers will be furloughed, although they will continue to draw most of their pay, under the terms of their union contract.
Chrysler and foreign automakers did not release production schedules today. Auto production schedules affect the entire economy because the industry accounts directly for about 4 percent of the nation's economic output, and accounts directly or indirectly for a quarter of the output of Michigan, Ohio and Indiana.
Some auto industry officials were nonetheless cautious today about how much longer the good times could last, given consumers' increasing gloominess. The major automakers stayed with their estimates that sales for all of this year would be 16 million to 16.5 million cars and light trucks. Since the annual sales rate in January reached 17.1 million vehicles, this means that the manufacturers expect slower sales later in the year.
Ford used to expect a weak first half of this year followed by a stronger second half. Now, the company anticipates a somewhat longer slowdown enduring at least into the third quarter, said Emily Kolinski, a Ford economist.
Paul Ballew, G.M.'s executive director for market analysis, noted that March and April were more important for auto sales than January and February, and would provide a better test of the industry's strength.
Foreign automakers continued to gain market share last month at the expense of the manufacturers based in the Detroit area. Sales at G.M. declined 9.5 percent from a year earlier, while Chrysler's dropped 10.5 percent and Ford's were down 11.2 percent.
G.M.'s market share was 31.2 percent, several points higher than in recent months and matching its share a year ago, when the company was offering incentives that were much more generous, Mr. Stoddard said.
Japanese automakers fared even better. Honda's sales jumped 9.4 percent and Toyota's climbed 1 percent, while Mitsubishi's were down 2.8 percent and Nissan's sales were down 6.1 percent.
European automakers had uneven results, with BMW's sales rising 19 percent while Volkswagen's dipped 10.4 percent and the Mercedes unit of DaimlerChrysler had a 2 percent increase.
Ford named Jan Klug, 41, as its vice president for global marketing today. He is replacing James Schroer, who resigned last week to join Chrysler.
Ms. Klug has been overseeing Ford's sport utility vehicle promotions, including its successful "No Boundaries" campaign, which has been matched recently by a similar Toyota campaign.

HEADLINE: The Mind-Set of a Slowdown; 
Thriving or Hurting, U.S. Manufacturers Brace for the Worst

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Herbert V. Kohler Jr., chairman of the Kohler Company, was caught by surprise when the economic slowdown hit last fall. In the past, sales of the company's bathroom and kitchen fixtures invariably began to fall six months before the economy did, giving him plenty of warning. "They are my leading indicator," Mr. Kohler said. But this time, toilets, sinks and bathtubs kept on selling as briskly as ever, and they still are.
 No sector, despite Kohler's experience, is feeling the pain of the weakening economy more than manufacturing. Robert Barnett, an executive vice president at Motorola, calls what is happening a "spiraling recession." That is certainly Motorola's experience in cellular phones and semiconductors. Some other manufacturers are similarly hard hit, particularly in computers and autos. But across the broad expanse of American industry, the situation is much more diverse. 
 Some companies, like Kohler, have hardly been touched. Others, like the Fluor Corporation, a giant engineering and construction operation, are hurting in America and thriving overseas. Still others, like the Goodman Equipment Corporation, a maker of small locomotives for mining and tunnel building, are shipping their main products in the old volumes, but feeling the slowdown in sales of spare parts, a secondary source of revenue. 
Despite these wide differences among manufacturers, their strategies for the weeks ahead are eerily uniform. Bracing for the worst, most of America's industrial leaders are hunkering down by eliminating overtime, putting a freeze on hiring, scaling back on new investment and shrinking the number of jobs at their companies. Yet in doing so to strengthen their operations for the longer term, they may be helping to make it more likely that in the short run a full-blown recession could indeed arrive.
"When uncertainty spreads, as it is spreading now, you focus on defending your profitability," said Ralph F. Hake, executive vice president and chief financial officer at Fluor. "And that, unfortunately, is self-defeating."
Top executives from more than 100 manufacturing companies gathered in Key Largo, Fla., last weekend for the winter board meeting of the National Association of Manufacturers and concluded that the economic slowdown would endure. In a poll, 53 percent of the 88 executives who responded predicted that economic growth would remain very weak or even nonexistent until year's end, missing the early summer revival that many forecasters still expect. 
Such gloomy sentiments -- useful to the association in persuading the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates again and again -- stand in striking contrast to the more upbeat stories that many manufacturers tell about their current situation. Motorola is more the exception than the rule. With its cell phone business in free fall, it may lose money this quarter, a rare experience. Lucent, Gateway and DaimlerChrysler are similarly in trouble.
But in interviews, executives of a dozen companies making an assortment of products described their experience as more like a tire with a slow leak than a balloon suddenly popped. The slowdown is even seen by some companies as an opportunity to cut costs that should have been eliminated during the boom years.
"In a convoluted way, a downturn provides the opportunity for a cleansing of overcapacity," said Thomas E. Evans, chairman of the Collins & Aikman Corporation, which makes the textile and plastic parts of auto interiors and has closed 3 of its 65 plants. "It creates an acceptable moment to take cost-cutting steps that a lot of managers wanted to do anyway."
That is not a thought shared by Mr. Kohler, whose grandfather founded the Kohler Company a century ago. For him, the slowdown first showed itself not at any of the company's 43 factories, but at the two luxury hotels the company operates in Kohler, Wis., across from the big headquarters plant. "We saw a nervousness in November and December among companies that had scheduled meetings at our hotels for February and March," Mr. Kohler said. "Three or four canceled their reservations."
Kohler, with revenue of $3 billion last year, also makes gasoline motors for garden tractors that homeowners buy. The demand for the motors has fallen by 10 percent since fall. "That smarts," Mr. Kohler said. But sales of plumbing fixtures are still rising, despite the weakness in new-home construction. "People are remodeling their homes more than ever, and that surprises me," Mr. Kohler said.
Resisting the pessimism, he is maintaining capital spending in 2001 at last year's pace of more than $100 million a year. A new factory is going up in Mexico, and plant expansions are under way in the United States, reflecting Mr. Kohler's view that once the economy revives, the extra outlay today will more than pay for itself tomorrow.
Still, in other ways, the Kohler Company is very much in the cost-cutting mainstream. "Overtime disappears naturally; our foremen and supervisors know to pull it back," he said. "And we have slowed hiring."
Capital spending, a source of so much strength for the national economy until last fall, is spotty now. Oil and natural gas companies, for example, are splurging, which gives the Fluor Corporation's revenues a considerable lift through contracts for the pipelines and new refinery capacity that Fluor provides. "Our backlog is beginning to grow; new orders are up about 35 percent in the last two months," Mr. Hake said. "But most of this is overseas." 
At home, for every Kohler in manufacturing that is sustaining its investment plans, other companies are behaving more like Collins & Aikman, an auto industry supplier that is holding back. A backlog of unsold vehicles has forced automakers to cut production, which means that suppliers like Collins & Aikman must also pull back -- and capital spending is not spared.
"The car companies call me and say they are going to cut in half what they buy from us for two weeks, and then go back to full orders," said Mr. Evans, the chairman. The automakers' goal is to keep the suppliers ready to resume full production when the inventory backlog is worked off and the rebound occurs with the introduction of new models in late summer.
That is the expectation. Until it materializes, Collins & Aikman, with headquarters in Troy, Mich., is maintaining enough capacity to fill orders, but is also gradually trimming -- preparing for a rebound that in Mr. Evans's view will never return production to the booming levels that prevailed until the fall. Jobs are being eliminated, including most recently 500 middle-level administrative jobs.
And capital spending has been deferred, as Mr. Evans puts it. New equipment is essential to improve quality and efficiency. But instead of spending $150 million over six months, the original plan, Collins & Aikman is deferring $20 million, including $4 million for computers. "Deferral is not canceling," Mr. Evans said. "There is a powerful difference. We are still moving our agenda forward, but capital spending is one of the things you can control. And when you have to cut back, you turn to the things you can control."
At the Goodman Equipment Corporation in Bedford Park, Ill., discounting, on two fronts, is helping the company through these difficult months. Orders are up for the locomotives it makes for mining and tunnel work and normally sells for $75,000 to $425,000, depending on size. But starting late last year, Calvin A. Campbell Jr., Goodman's chairman, found himself agreeing to discounts of 3 to 10 percent.
The company takes in a big chunk of revenue from the sale of spare parts for the hundreds of locomotives now in the field. "People are saying," Mr. Campbell said, " 'Why should we buy the spare parts and put it on our shelf? You keep it on your shelf.' "
Still, there is a safety valve. Over the years, Goodman has outsourced almost everything except the actual locomotive assembly. Lately, the outsourcing has produced an unanticipated dividend. "The suppliers have been calling on us much more aggressively," Mr. Campbell said. "We can give a 10 percent discount on the locomotives we sell because we can get discounts on what is coming in from our suppliers."
If Goodman Equipment is getting relief from its suppliers, the huge Manitowoc Company, with headquarters in Manitowoc, Wis., is creating its own relief. It has sped up production in response to the reluctance of its customers to be more generous in their ordering. Manitowoc's product line includes construction cranes, some of them giant contraptions mounted on crawlers that can lift a thousand tons -- roughly 50 elephants -- 400 feet.
The $6 million price tag means that buyers finance purchases, not only of the biggest cranes but also of the smallest version, selling for $500,000. They are not happy about the cost of doing that at today's interest rates, even allowing for the Federal Reserve's rate cuts starting in January, says Terry D. Growcock, chief executive at Manitowoc. So the orders are being placed at the last minute, only after a contract has been signed for a construction job instead of six months in advance in anticipation of the contract.
"We are still selling roughly 200 cranes a year," Mr. Growcock said. "But with much less of an order backlog, we have to build the cranes in 50 to 60 days instead of the 120 that prevailed a couple of years ago. It forces you to work much more closely with your suppliers."
Like many executives in manufacturing, Ronald P. Sandmeyer Jr., chief executive of the family-owned Sandmeyer Steel Company in Philadelphia, is braced for the worst. So when orders dropped off last month for Sandmeyer's stainless steel plate, overtime for the 150 employees quickly disappeared.
The company is still getting about 100 requests a month for price quotes, "but our customers are not pulling the trigger at the same rate," Mr. Sandmeyer said.
Instead of the usual 35 orders, the company got 29 in the last month, and for smaller amounts than usual. But February is always a weak month, and Mr. Sandmeyer worries about overreacting -- hunkering down too much.
"It is too soon to know what is happening to us," he said, "but certainly it is a concern when I hear what I am hearing. I don't know if we are talking ourselves into a recession."

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Creates Unit to Spot Early Signs of Foreign Crises 

BYLINE:  By DAVID STOUT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 1 

 BODY:
As they followed the economic crisis in Turkey with concern, leaders of the International Monetary Fund said today that they were creating a unit to anticipate and head off financial crises in countries to which the fund makes loans.
 The unit, to be known as the International Capital Markets Department, will consolidate the gathering and analysis of information that are now spread among other I.M.F. departments, said Horst Kohler, the fund's managing director. 
 Mr. Kohler asserted that today's announcement was neither precipitated nor hastened by the situation in Turkey. The country was hit last week by a second bout of financial turmoil, despite a multibillion-dollar I.M.F. assistance package intended to stabilize markets. He said his decision to create the department followed a recommendation from a panel formed in October to analyze the fund's operations. The panel was headed by John Lipsky, chief economist at Chase Manhattan Bank. 
"I see this department as a vital part of the ongoing efforts to strengthen the international financial architecture, and in particular to strengthen the fund's role in crisis prevention," Mr. Kohler said in a statement. "With this move, the fund is sending a clear signal that it is serious about its commitment to being a center of excellence for work on financial markets issues."
Elaborating in a question-and-answer session, Mr. Kohler said the new unit "will enhance the fund's early-warning capabilities." A director for the new unit will be appointed as soon as the right person can be found, he said.
The fund, which has 183 member countries, exists to promote international monetary cooperation and stability and to provide financial assistance to countries that need it. It has been criticized for being slow to anticipate problems in Mexico, Russia and other nations, and thus investing effort and money unwisely.
Mr. Kohler and the fund's second-ranking executive, Stanley Fischer, agreed today that some of that criticism has been justified. 
"Not every crisis is unforeseen," Mr. Fischer said. He acknowledged that the fund should have better anticipated the monetary crisis that struck Mexico in 1994, for instance.
But Mr. Fischer said the situation in Turkey "was hardly to be anticipated by anyone's analysis."
A dispute between Turkey's president and prime minister flared up last week. It disrupted the Istanbul stock market, scared away foreign investors and sent the Turkish currency into a free fall. The big drop in the currency is being felt across the country in many ways. World Business, Section W. Turkey is a North Atlantic Treaty Organization partner and permits its bases to be used by American planes that patrol Iraq. President Bush has expressed his concern about the situation there.
The fund lent $7.5 billion to Turkey in December after a flight by foreign investors threatened a national economic program aimed at reining in inflation and government spending. Mr. Kohler said today that it would be up to Turkey to "demonstrate by action" that the fund's support has been justified.
The new department head will face difficult choices. If he tries to operate quietly and things go wrong in a particular region, he may be criticized for not focusing enough attention on a simmering problem. 
But if he elects to be more open about what he sees going wrong, he may risk causing widespread alarm, driving away investors, and thus aggravating the very situation the monetary fund is supposed to alleviate.

HEADLINE: Struggling City Preps For National Close-Up 

BYLINE:  By JOHN W. FOUNTAIN 

DATELINE: GARY, Ind., March 1 

 BODY:
There is something in the air these days, and it is not just the thick white smoke billowing from the few remaining smokestacks in this long-neglected and perpetually struggling industrial city.
 It is a rare sense of excitement, hope and promise for a city that has had enough bad publicity to last a lifetime. Gary is about to gain the national spotlight with what many would consider the unlikeliest of events: the Miss USA beauty pageant. 
 As one larger-than-life poster high on the side of the abandoned downtown Sheraton hotel boasts, "Gary goes worldwide March 2 on CBS." 
The show goes on Friday night. It is the culmination of months of preparation that has gift-wrapped this city in more glamour than anyone here can remember. And who knows? It just might help turn things around.
Mayor Scott L. King and many others here have high hopes that being the pageant's host city for three years will boost the economy and residents' morale.
Gary bid $1.2 million to play host to the pageant, which is co-owned by CBS and Donald J. Trump, who just happens to own a casino here. Mr. Trump's is one of two casinos in Gary, and they bring in an estimated $25 million in annual tax revenues, city officials said.
While no one expects a cure-all, many here say that prime-time exposure can only help to change perceptions about their city and attract not only businesses to central Gary but also spenders from suburban northwest Indiana and tourists.
That any city would pin its hopes on six hours of TV spread over three years, and on a program that last year ranked 39th in weekly Nielsen ratings (just behind "Ladies Man" on CBS), may say a lot about the dazzling allure of the entertainment business.
But it also says a lot about Gary. Dreamers have had little to cling to in a city crippled -- a lifetime ago, it seems -- by the demise of the steel industry, rampant poverty and a staggering crime rate. While Gary is no longer the nation's murder capital, the process of rebuilding has been agonizingly slow.
And that is why the stage has been set, the trimmings painstakingly completed.
Golden banners on downtown street lights flutter in the wind. Abandoned buildings have been adorned with painted windows. The streets have been swept. And the Genesis Convention Center in the heart of downtown, where the pageant will be held, sparkles.
Friday's broadcast, with William Shatner as host, will include nine minutes of spots promoting Gary. Some, shot last summer, highlight the dunes and beaches along Lake Michigan. Others show the contestants milling about the more photogenic places in town. And already some residents here say the show-business sparkle has begun to rub off in their town.
"It's a good thing," said Lucy Bravo one afternoon this week, standing in her family's downtown restaurant, Los Tacos Bravo's, on Broadway Avenue in the shadow of the convention center. "Gary is like dead, there's nothing here. So with the Miss USA pageant, it's a whole different atmosphere."
"Gary is a nice place," Mrs. Bravo continued, the scent of tortillas filling the air. She said she hoped people outside Gary would begin to "look for the good side because the city has its ups and downs." She was standing behind bulletproof glass, near a picture of the reigning Miss USA, Lynnette Cole, and a sign showing a gun and the words "I don't dial 911." 
While reshaping the city's image will not be easy, nearly everyone here believes it is necessary. A predominantly black city of about 111,000, with a white mayor, Gary bills itself as a city on the mend.
Mayor King, in his second four-year term, said the pageant "has the ability to build local pride in the city and the psychology of the public in a positive way. If you don't have that, nothing else you do is going to work."
With the acquisition of the Steelheads, an International Basketball League team that since December has played at the renovated 6,000-seat convention center, Mr. King said there already has been a trickling in of people who live on the fringes of the city. The city is also laying plans to build a stadium to host a minor-league baseball team as well as other projects over the next several years as it seeks to rebuild downtown and attract private investors.
"I am seeing some fruit," Mr. King said. "Deals still have to be closed, but at least deals are being discussed. Two or three years ago, Gary wasn't even considered." 
Meanwhile, many here like Anthony Mayo, 40, a garage attendant, are gearing up for the pageant.
"For me it's worth it to bring people in and say, 'Hey, you know what, we're people like everybody else,' " said Mr. Mayo, collecting the $3 fee from motorists.
"This is not Chicago. This is not New York. We don't have a tall building. But we have people who are willing to work together to pull it off."
Late this week, crews of workers could still be spotted adding final touches. Not far from downtown, in a neighborhood of boarded-up houses, vacant lots and blight, a famous house still stands.
It is an unassuming red and white frame house with a partial brick front and no special note about its former occupants, the Jackson Five, who wrote a song about this house at 2300 Jackson Street. The current occupant, a mustachioed elderly man, speaking cautiously from behind a black security door, assured a visitor that Michael Jackson and the Jackson family were long gone and likely were not looking back.
But downtown, at the abandoned Palace Theater spruced up with the painted facades, the letters being put up by workers announced, "Jackson Five Tonight."
"I'm just trying to create a media event," said Chris Toepfer, one of the workers, patching up buildings for the city. "This sign was so ugly that they originally wanted us to take it down. We're making the theater look so nice that people will actually show up and think we're selling tickets."
As the men worked, the sign caught the eyes of a passing motorist, who rolled down her car window and excitedly asked, "Are the Jackson Five coming?"
The answer was no. But just down the street, there was Miss USA. No kidding.

Drilling In the Cathedral

BYLINE:  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
Listening to President Bush's speech about his budget the other night, you could hear the theme song for his administration: "Don't Start Thinkin' About Tomorrow."
 The short translation of the Bush speech is: Hey, it's not the government's money, it's your money. It's not your children's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, it's your refuge, and you can drill for oil there if you want. It's not your national debt, it's your grandchildren's national debt. 
 Geez, and they said the Clintonites were self-absorbed -- me-me, I-I, now-now, yuppies. What about this crowd?
I'll let the experts point out the irresponsibility built into the Bush budget. As my colleague Paul Krugman, a real economist, has deftly explained, there is no way Mr. Bush's budget numbers can work without making wildly optimistic surplus projections, or stealing from future generations, or taking risks no serious person would take with his family's budget.
Having just visited Alaska, though, I'm troubled by what such thinking can do to the environment. What happened to the word "conservation"? Has it gone the way of "liberal"? Are we no longer allowed to call for conservation without engendering catcalls? America has 5 percent of the world's population, but consumes nearly 25 percent of world oil supplies. Yes, some speechwriter did slip one reference to conservation into Mr. Bush's speech, but only after he first emphasized his favored approach to our energy deficit -- more "production." 
I could understand, if we were down to our last barrels of oil and our very lifestyle were threatened, that we might risk believing the oil companies that they can drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, in northern Alaska, without damage. But we are so far away from that. We have not even begun to explore how just a little conservation, or a small, painless increase in energy efficiency, could relieve us from even thinking about risking one of the earth's most pristine environments.
Check out the Web site of the Natural Resources Defense Council (www.NRDC.org). It notes that the most credible estimates indicate that the Arctic Refuge contains about 3.2 billion barrels of economically recoverable crude oil -- less than America consumes in six months. Risking the Arctic Refuge to extract that pittance of oil is nuts, when it could be painlessly extracted through better conservation and efficiency. As the Defense Council points out, by simply increasing average fuel efficiency on new cars, S.U.V.'s and light trucks from 24 to 39 miles per gallon over the next decade, we would save 51 billion barrels of oil -- more than 15 times the likely yield from the Arctic. At the same time, if we just required replacement tires for cars and light trucks to be as fuel-efficient as the original tires on new vehicles (which have lower rolling resistance), we would save 5.4 billion barrels of oil over the next 50 years, far more than in the Arctic Refuge.
The Arctic Refuge is a unique environmental cathedral -- a 19-million-acre expanse where mountains meet ocean, where grizzly bears meet polar bears, where 130,000 caribou migrate each spring to give birth on the coastal plain, where an entire ecosystem is preserved and where Mother Nature is totally in charge. This is not Yellowstone Park, with campsites and R.V.'s. The original idea behind the refuge's creation was to save an area of pure wilderness, in which there would be no maps, virtually no roads and no development. When the Bush team says it can drill in such wilderness without harming it, it's like saying you can do online trading in church on your Palm Pilot without disturbing anyone. It violates the very ethic of the place.
"Wilderness as a concept is immutable," explains Richard Fineberg, an Anchorage-based environmental consultant. "It is like perfection -- there are no degrees to it. Oil development in a wilderness, no matter how sensitive, changes the very nature of it. It means it's no longer wilderness. If the drill worshipers prevail in the Arctic Refuge, then there will be no place on this continent where a unique environment will be safe from greed and short-term interests." 
What will you tell your grandchildren when they ask: How could you destroy a unique wilderness area to buy six months' supply of gasoline? Why didn't you just improve gas mileage a little each year? Why didn't you lift just a tiny finger for conservation? Weren't you thinking about tomorrow at all?

HEADLINE: On Party Lines, Panel Approves Lower Tax Rate 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 1 

 BODY:
Voting along party lines, the House Ways and Means Committee approved the heart of President Bush's tax cut plan today and set up a vote in the full House next week.
 The bill would lower tax rates across the board. This year, all individuals who owe income taxes would have them reduced by $180, and couples would get a cut of $360. 
 In future years, the tax reductions would grow and would be much larger for the wealthiest taxpayers. Over 10 years, the measure would cost $958 billion, about three-fifths of the $1.6 trillion in tax relief the president wants over that period. 
The bill, the centerpiece of Mr. Bush's presidential campaign and the top item on his legislative agenda, was adopted, 23 to 15, with all Republicans in favor and all Democrats opposed. The Republican majority rejected a Democratic alternative that offered smaller cuts and little relief for the wealthy.
The legislation's prospects in the Senate are uncertain, and no measure is likely to be enacted before summer.
The legislation was limited to reducing tax rates. The other parts of the Bush plan, like repeal of the estate tax and a doubling of the tax credit for children, were put off.
"This is the beginning, not the end," said Representative Bill Thomas, Republican of California, the Ways and Means Committee chairman.
Republicans moved unusually fast -- without public testimony and before an overall budget outline had been approved -- and made part of the rate cut retroactive to the beginning of this year, in part to overcome objections that Congress could not act quickly enough for a tax reduction to stimulate the economy.
At a time of "weakness and uncertainty in the economy," Mr. Thomas said, "this will put real dollars in the pockets of workers today."
But mainly, Republican leaders in the House were eager to take advantage of the new president's political honeymoon and to put pressure on the Senate.
Democrats complained that Republicans had given them no voice in writing the legislation and had breached the spirit of bipartisanship that the president has said he is trying to foster.
"Not allowing the minority to express itself, even when it's going to lose, is not the climate the president is trying to initiate," said Representative Charles B. Rangel of Manhattan, the committee's ranking Democrat.
Bald partisanship, however, is the way of the House of Representatives. When Democrats controlled the House, they were no more solicitous of the views of Republicans.
The Senate does not plan to follow the tracks of the House and consider the various aspects of tax legislation piecemeal. And it looks as if the president will have to make compromises to get any tax measure through the Senate. So, despite the efforts in the House to move with what for Congress is warp speed, tax legislation is unlikely to become law before summer.
Democrats argued that the Republican plan was fiscally irresponsible, of no help to the economy and unfairly tilted toward the rich.
"This is a reckless course we are following," Mr. Rangel declared.
Representative Michael R. McNulty, Democrat of New York, said the projected budget surpluses were too uncertain to be counted on.
"I don't want to go back to the days of deficit spending," Mr. McNulty said. "This bill puts us in that direction."
The Democrats insisted that they, too, favored a tax cut.
"What we are bickering about is how much and how we share it," said Representative Karen L. Thurman, Democrat of Florida.
Republicans insisted that with large budget surpluses forecast from now to the horizon, Americans deserved to get some of their tax money back from the government.
"Hard-working income-tax payers are paying more than they should or need to pay," Mr. Thomas declared.
Expressing the view of many of her fellow Republicans, Representative Nancy L. Johnson of Connecticut said, "It will have a real impact on the strength of the economy."
Democrats challenged that point, noting that the tax saving this year would be only $5.5 billion, about five one-hundredths of 1 percent of the $10 trillion national economy.
"Those who talk about the stimulative effect, you're talking about small drops in a huge sea," said Representative Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan.
This year, the bill would lower to 12 percent from 15 percent the tax rate on the first $6,000 of taxable income for individuals and $12,000 for couples. If the bill becomes law this year, tax withholdings will be adjusted so the saving will immediately show up in paychecks.
Beginning next year, other marginal tax rates would be reduced in stages so that by 2006, the lowest rate would be 10 percent, and the top rate would be cut to 33 percent from 39.6 percent. The intermediate marginal rates would also be cut year by year over five years. The 36 percent rate would also be reduced to 33 percent. The 31 percent rate would be cut to 28 percent. And the 28 percent rate would be cut to 25 percent.
Marginal rates are what taxpayers owe on the last dollar of taxable income. An affluent couple, for instance, now pays 15 percent on about $30,000 of taxable income and larger percentages on other income until the 39.6 percent rate is reached on the taxable income above about $200,000. Taxable income is the amount after exemptions and deductions are subtracted.
The bill would also change the alternative minimum tax, owed by taxpayers with unusually large deductions, to help families with three or more children and incomes below about $50,000.
The Democratic alternative, worked out last night by Senate and House leaders, would cost about half of the $1.6 trillion of the Bush proposal and would give much less tax relief to the wealthy. It stands no chance of being enacted. But it could be a starting point for negotiations if the Bush plan becomes bogged down in the Senate.

HEADLINE: House Passes Tighter Rules On Filing for Bankruptcy 

BYLINE:  By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 1 

 BODY:
The House today overwhelmingly approved a bill championed by the banking and credit card industries that would overhaul the nation's bankruptcy system and make it much harder for people to wipe out their debts.
 The bill, which may become the first major piece of legislation to be signed by President Bush, is subject to approval by the Senate, where Democrats are vowing to amend it significantly to make it less onerous on debtors. 
 President Clinton vetoed a nearly identical bill in his final weeks in office, describing it as anticonsumer. Mr. Bush has indicated that he will sign the bill if it reaches his desk. 
The vote in the House was 306 to 108, with majority Republicans solidly in support and Democrats split. The full Senate is expected to begin debating its version of the bill on Monday.
In urging support for the bill, its House Republican sponsors said that the legislation would end abuses of the bankruptcy system by debtors who are able to repay some of their loans. 
"Bankruptcy should never be an item of financial planning," said Representative James F. Sensenbrenner Jr., the Wisconsin Republican who is chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.
But opponents portrayed the bill as a gift to the banking and credit card industries, which produced major donations last year for Mr. Bush's presidential campaign and other political candidates, Democrats and Republicans alike.
The opponents said that the legislation would be disastrous for workers with good credit histories who may lose their jobs if the economy continues to sour.
Representative Jerrold Nadler, a New York Democrat, said the bill was "rotten" and the result of intense lobbying pressure on members of Congress by the financial industry. "It is a wish list of every big-money special interest group," Mr. Nadler said.
The bill would disqualify many debtors from filing for what is known as a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, which allows them to wipe out credit card debts and other unsecured loans, and force them into Chapter 13, which requires some repayment.
Supporters say the overhaul would end abuses by debtors who continue to have high incomes after bankruptcy and can pay off much of the money they owe.
"More Americans file for bankruptcy than graduate from college each year," said Thomas Donohue, president of the United States Chamber of Commerce, in welcoming the House vote. "Congress needs to send a message to wealthy debtors that it's time to pay their bills."
Opponents point out that most people who enter bankruptcy do not have high incomes -- a 1999 study by federal judges found the median income of debtors seeking bankruptcy was $21,500 -- and say that the bill would put credit card companies on an equal footing with women and children in seeking the assets of bankrupt fathers.
"With the economy sinking, this unbalanced bill couldn't come at a worse time for American consumers," said Howard M. Metzenbaum, the retired Ohio senator who is chairman of the Consumer Federation of America. 
"The credit card companies used their political might to push through legislation that will limit access to a fresh start in bankruptcy for many who lose a job."

HEADLINE: Political Memo; 
Senator Clinton's New Plan Barely Whispers in the Din

BYLINE:  By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 1 

 BODY:
Hillary Rodham Clinton took to the floor of the United States Senate this morning to unveil the first package of legislation she has authored in her young Congressional career: a wide-ranging plan to bolster the sagging economy of upstate New York.
 But no sooner had New York's newest senator presented her plan than she found herself answering another round of questions about ethics, even as a high-profile hearing into former President Bill Clinton's last-minute pardons was being held across the Capitol complex. 
 That is how things seem to have gone for Mrs. Clinton during her first two months in Congress, a period that stands out not so much for her accomplishments as for the mounting scrutiny of the Clintons' last days in the White House. 
No matter whether Mrs. Clinton is being the dutiful junior senator from New York, offering a prescription for the ailing upstate economy, or inveighing against President Bush's tax cut, all anyone seems to want to talk about is her husband's scandal-plagued presidency.
It has made what was already a difficult transition for the former first lady even more difficult. That was never more evident than this morning, when Mrs. Clinton, looking confident and poised, walked out of the Senate chamber to field questions about her plan.
The plan itself contained no great surprises, since her aides had been talking about it for days in the hopes of drumming up enthusiasm. It offered a broad array of tax credits, grants and other incentives intended to create jobs in the upstate region and other economically troubled sections of the country, with a focus on creating growth in the high-tech industry.
Mrs. Clinton said she was seeking to fulfill one of her major campaign pledges: tackling the staggering job losses upstate, a region that proved pivotal to her victory in November and one whose economy has lagged behind that of the rest of the state.
Mrs. Clinton seemed to be delighting in describing the nuts and bolts of her 42-page plan when she was interrupted with questions over the latest uproar to arise from her husband's presidency.
This one involved the disclosure that her brother Tony Rodham had helped get a pardon for a Tennessee couple last March over the objections of the Justice Department. Mr. Rodham acknowledged that he had asked President Clinton to pardon the couple, but said that he received no money for his trouble.
Mrs. Clinton wasted little time in trying to draw a distinction between the actions of her brother Tony and her brother Hugh. Hugh, it was learned last week, received $400,000 to lobby on behalf of two wealthy men who were granted presidential clemency. 
Mrs. Clinton described herself as heartbroken when Hugh Rodham's role was discovered -- and then sought to distance herself from that case. Hugh Rodham eventually gave the money back.
Today, as if to minimize the latest revelation, Mrs. Clinton stressed that the people Tony Rodham represented were acquaintances of the family and that Tony, unlike Hugh, did not get any money. But Mrs. Clinton refused to say whether she thought Tony Rodham's behavior was appropriate, saying only, "I don't know what involvement he had other than what he has said, which is that these are people that he knew."
Eventually, when it looked as though the message was getting away from Mrs. Clinton, with reporters eager to press her for more details, her aides abruptly brought the appearance to an end. 
Ever since being sworn in 55 days ago, Mrs. Clinton has done her best to come across as a freshman lawmaker who is extremely eager to make a mark in the capital. Her aides say she has set up private meetings with her new colleagues, both Republicans and Democrats, to try to forge new alliances and discuss her legislative plans.
Mrs. Clinton, the aides say, is even well on her way to completing her next piece of legislation, one that seeks to provide scholarships and other financial incentives to lure people into the teaching profession. 
But for all Mrs. Clinton's efforts to get on with her new life as a senator, a sense of crisis has seemed to grip her office from one day to the next.
For instance, a top aide to one representative from New York recently explained that it had been very difficult for his boss to schedule a meeting with Mrs. Clinton.
"She really hasn't been that accessible," said the aide. "We've tried to reach out, but her office has been under siege with all this pardon stuff."
Then, the aide added: "I think it's been a very bad transition for her. If she had had her druthers, she would have faded into the background."
Mrs. Clinton and her staff had hoped to put to rest any questions over the pardon controversy last week by having her make an extraordinary appearance on Capitol Hill in which she took more than 60 questions from a sometimes combative press corps. But the matter is far from over for Mrs. Clinton, though members of her staff insist that she is going to put her head down and "keep working on the issues important to New York."
And if that doesn't do it, at least she does not have any other siblings to worry about. As one of her staffers mordantly put it this afternoon: "I think she is out of brothers, and has no sisters."

HEADLINE: Consumer Sentiment Index Is at 5-Year Low 

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
An important measure of consumer sentiment tumbled in February to its lowest level in nearly five years, economists said yesterday.
 The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index, which is closely watched as a barometer of Americans' views on the economy, has now registered its sharpest three-month fall since October 1990, in the midst of the last economic contraction. 
 The university said its consumer sentiment index, reported twice monthly, fell to 90.6 in February -- a level last seen in May 1996 -- from 94.7 in January. That was a slight bounce up from its midmonth preliminary figure of 87.8, but analysts cautioned that sentiment remained on a clear downward trend.
"The trend is down, and it's going to continue to go down," said Joseph LaVorgna, senior United States economist at Deutsche Bank Securities.
The February current-conditions barometer, which measures how consumers feel about their present financial picture, fell to 105.8 from 107.7 in January. While that also represented a slight bump upward from the midmonth figure, the three-month drop in current conditions was the largest since December 1991.

HEADLINE: Economic Fears For Palestinians 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, March 2 

 BODY:
The American ambassador to Israel cautioned today that "semi-anarchy and gang rule" are engulfing the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
 The envoy, Martin S. Indyk, also warned Palestinians that Washington would not tolerate an increase in public support for terror attacks against Israel. 
 Israel has sealed off the Palestinian areas in an effort to thwart attacks, and this has crippled the Palestinian economy by keeping 100,000 laborers from their jobs.
"The Palestinian economy is on the brink of collapse," Mr. Indyk told a gathering of Israeli business people. "A state of semi-anarchy and gang-rule is engulfing the West Bank and Gaza."
The violence since September has killed 414 people, including 342 Palestinians. But, Mr. Indyk said, if violence continues, the Hezbollah militia in Lebanon is likely to demonstrate solidarity with the Palestinians by increasing attacks on Israel's border.

HEADLINE: Is Democracy Still on the Dial? 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT WORTH 

 BODY:
These are dark days for local radio. The number of independent stations falls every year, and in December Congress all but killed a federal plan to license hundreds of new noncommercial low-power stations throughout the country.
 Does it matter? So there may not be a broadcast of whale noises 24 hours a day from a recording device on the ocean floor off the Alaska coast, which was the plan of one proposed station. 
 But there is more at stake in the low-power debate than bringing some more diversity to the FM dial. For some scholars and advocates, Congress's action has revived an 80-year-old debate about the role that radio plays in a free society. Which promotes democracy better: a government guarantee of broader public access to the airwaves or letting free market forces reign? 
To low-power advocates, radio deserves special government protection because it is or ought to be the ultimate grass-roots medium. Even in the age of the Internet and cable television, radio remains the cheapest way (short of a bullhorn) to be heard by your friends and neighbors. You can start a pirate station if you have the $800 to buy a simple transmitter, an antenna and the cable to connect them. It is also the most accessible: you don't even have to be literate to listen to it. And while some low-power stations might be too small and eccentric to make a difference, many others could offer community news and special programming that small towns and ethnic enclaves would otherwise not get.
"I think radio should be carved out as the people's medium," said Robert W. McChesney, a professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign who has written widely on radio history.
Radio was instrumental, for example, in bringing democracy to the former Communist bloc, where dissidents often relied on Radio Liberty and Radio Free Europe for information about their own countries. "If my fellow citizens knew me before I became president, they did so because of these stations," the Czech president, Vaclav Havel, said in 1990.
Some East Europeans see a parallel between radio's role in their countries and the low-power movement in the United States. Peter Molnar, a former member of the Hungarian Parliament, recently wrote in the online magazine at www.mediachannel .org that if the Congressional decision to scale back low-power radio is final, opponents of free radio "will point to the United States with a dark smile and ask why idealists are talking about civic access to radio and television frequencies when the leading democracy in the world fails to guarantee that opportunity to its own citizens."
Clearly, radio's local role has dwindled as big media chains have bought out their smaller competitors. The Federal Communications Commission hoped to reverse that trend when it introduced the low-power plan in January 2000. But the major broadcasters, joined by National Public Radio, argued that the new stations would interfere with existing signals, and in December Congress dealt its blow to the plan by setting new technical standards and withdrawing some of the F.C.C.'s regulatory power. (On Wednesday, Sen. John McCain introduced a bill to restore part of the plan, but industry analysts agree that it is unlikely to succeed.)
Most people appear to have forgotten, Mr. McChesney said, that when radio first appeared in the 1920's, many politicians said corporations should not be allowed to profit from advertising. The broadcast spectrum was considered a natural resource, like the air, to which every citizen had a claim.
In 1922 a conservative like Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover could say of radio: "It is inconceivable that we should allow so great a possibility for service to be drowned in advertising chatter."
Even after commercial broadcasting gained a foothold in the late 1920's with the founding of CBS and NBC, there was a strong movement, joined by organized labor, religious and civil liberties groups, to reserve a significant part of the radio spectrum for noncommercial broadcasting.
Many of these allies hoped that President Franklin D. Roosevelt would side with them. But by the mid-1930's the broadcasters had powerful allies in Congress, and Roosevelt was reluctant to fight them. When Roosevelt signed the Communications Act of 1934, the resistance to commercial broadcasting died, and the new industry tried hard to erase the notion that there had ever been an alternative, according to accounts in Erik Barnouw's multivolume history of American broadcasting and Mr. McChesney's "Telecommunications, Mass Media and Democracy (Oxford, 1993).
By 1937 the president of CBS, William S. Paley, declared of broadcasting that "he who attacks the American system attacks democracy itself."
The notion that commercial radio stifled democracy rather than nourishing it was not entirely dead. It was behind the passage of the 1967 Public Broadcasting Act, followed soon by the creation of the Public Broadcasting Service and National Public Radio.
But in recent years that idea has fared poorly. After the Telecommunications Act of 1996 removed limits on the number of stations a single corporation could own, big media companies engaged in a feeding frenzy. The result has been a drastic decline in the number of independent stations on the dial. By the end of 1999, two companies, Clear Channel Communications and Infinity (a division of Viacom), controlled about a third of the $15.5 billion annual revenue of the radio industry, said James Duncan Jr., president of Duncan's American Radio Inc., which publishes and analyzes industry data. 
Critics of commercial radio like Jason Loviglio, an assistant professor at the University of Maryland, argue that this is proof that the advocates of noncommercial radio in the 1920's and 30's were right: big business is killing radio's democratic promise, severely limiting the number of voices that can be heard.
Some conservative scholars argue that less government protection is the way to free up the airwaves. "If you want to advance democratic values through policy, said Thomas Hazlett, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, "the way to get there is opening markets to additional competition."
But to others, the problem with the American system is not too little democracy but too much.
"If you look at the earliest reliable public opinion polls, you'll find antipathy to broadcast advertising is strongest among the well off and well educated," said Clifford J. Doerksen, a visiting professor at the University of Illinois who is completing a book on the early years of radio. "Lower down the socioeconomic scale, people mind it less, even like it. Culturally and economically speaking, the system we developed is the system most people like."
Meanwhile, emerging technologies could transform the debate about radio and democracy. Internet radio stations are already becoming popular, and digital and satellite technology could also expand options available to the average listener.
What many critics of the American system really want, contends Mr. Doerksen, is not so much more democracy as a system more like the one that evolved in Britain, where the British Broadcasting Corporation had a monopoly from its founding in 1927 until the 1950's. The BBC was financed with a tax on receivers, avoiding the need for advertising.
The BBC, however impressive its cultural and political programming, was hardly democratic, Mr. Doerksen said. Its directors refused to survey listeners, rooting their choices in what the BBC's legendary first director, Sir John Reith, called "an active faith that a supply of good things will create a demand for them, not waiting for the demand to express itself." That made for high standards, but listeners grew frustrated with the BBC's austere programming, and its monopoly gradually eroded.
Michele Hilmes, a professor at the University of Wisconsin at Madison who is writing a book comparing public and commercial radio systems throughout the world, said: "You do run into a contradiction. The BBC is very elitist. Commercial radio is very popular, but not in a way that would lead to public service standards. How do you separate out what is popular from what we might like to prescribe in the public interest, which unfortunately the public isn't very interested in?"

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares Bounce Around After Early Sell-Off

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The stock market had a wild ride yesterday, with the three major indexes plunging at the opening bell and then rebounding strongly to post modest gains. Then, like an athlete tiring near the finish line, the rally lost its steam in the late afternoon.
 Just minutes after 10 a.m., the Nasdaq composite index was down 4.2 percent and the Dow Jones industrial average was off 1.4 percent. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index had fallen 1.7 percent, to 1,219.74, at which point it was down just over 20 percent from its peak on March 24, 2000, putting it into bear-market territory. 
 Then, investors seemed to shrug off the news of more earnings disappointments, which had ignited the early selling, and began buying stocks.
By the close, the Dow -- which had rallied to a gain of 129 points from a loss of 148 points -- eked out a 16.17-point rise, to 10,466.31. For the week, the Dow was up 0.2 percent.
The S.& P. 500 index fell 7.05 points yesterday, or 0.6 percent, to 1,234.18 and was off 0.9 percent for the week.
The Nasdaq finished the day down 65.74 points, or 3 percent, at 2,117.63. That is its lowest close since December 1998. For the week, the Nasdaq was off 6.4 percent. The Nasdaq has now dropped 25.9 percent from its Jan. 24 high and is down 58 percent from its record high last March.
Cisco Systems, down $2.31, to $22.19, and EMC, down $4.51, to $38.40, were two of the stocks that swooned in the afternoon.
The source of most of the bad news yesterday was Oracle, which said after the market closed on Thursday that it would miss earnings forecasts for the most recent quarter because of delays in orders for its software. Oracle led the technology sector down, falling $4.50, to $16.88.
Still, yesterday was the second consecutive day that the market had bounced back after sharp early declines, which may be an indication that some investors feel that the market has fallen enough to account for a sharp slowdown in economic growth and the expectations of lower corporate earnings in the first half of this year. If that is the case, there are many stocks that look like good buys.
But there still could be trouble ahead because the economic slowdown, which began in the third quarter of last year, is already more severe than originally expected. And this slowdown still could turn out to be a recession.
"The overwhelming message from important leading indicators is that a recession is in place here," said Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at Hoenig & Company.
William Rhodes, chief investment strategist at the Williams Capital Group, said he did not think the market would begin to recover until investors believed that company revenue growth was beginning to pick up again and costs were coming down. "I would be surprised to see this in the second quarter," he said. "Maybe it will take place in the third quarter."
In addition, investors are now likely to have to wait until March 20, the next scheduled meeting of Federal Reserve policy makers, for another interest rate cut. Until the Congressional testimony on Wednesday by the Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, many investors had been hoping a reduction was imminent.
In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 4.94 percent, from 4.88 percent Thursday, its lowest since the fall of 1998. This ended a five-day rally that had brought the yield below 5 percent again. The price of the 10-year note, which moves in the opposite direction, fell 15/32, to 100 14/32.
The yield on the Treasury's two-year note, which is an indication of how investors feel about the likelihood of another Fed rate cut, rose to 4.46 percent from 4.41 percent on Thursday, also its lowest since 1998.

HEADLINE: U.S. Free of Disease for 70 Years, but Some Call Its Return Inevitable 

BYLINE:  By JANE E. BRODY 

 BODY:
Although the United States has not had an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease since 1929, some veterinary virologists believe that it is only a matter of time before a slip in agricultural hygiene or a tourist who flouts customs regulations reintroduces this highly infectious virus into American livestock.
 The tiny virus, which is now forcing the slaughter and incineration of tens of thousands of farm animals in Britain and several countries on the Continent, is in the same family as those causing the common cold. It can be spread by direct or indirect contact with infected animals; by people exposed to the virus who develop no symptoms but who harbor and spread it; by contaminated shoes, clothing, vehicles, farm implements, meat, milk and garbage, and by air. Weather permitting, the virus can travel many miles. 
 For instance, the last outbreak in Britain, which occurred on the Isle of Wight in 1981, was believed to have resulted from the airborne spread of the virus from Brittany in northern France. The virus survives refrigeration and freezing and can live for up to a month in the general environment, although heat, sunlight, disinfectants and high acid and alkaline conditions can inactivate it.
Outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease, especially the strain now seen in Britain, have been rising. The disease is endemic in parts of Asia, Africa, the Middle East and South America, where periodic outbreaks sometimes have severe economic consequences. 
In 1997, for instance, Taiwan was struck by a epidemic that ended up costing it $5 billion in lost revenues, containment efforts and compensatory payments to farmers whose livestock had to be destroyed. The British Agriculture Ministry said that in the last 12 months, outbreaks have occurred in Bhutan, Brazil, Colombia, Egypt, Georgia, Greece, Japan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Malawi, Malaysia, Mongolia, Namibia, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Taiwan, Tajikistan, Uruguay and Zambia.
The virus incubates for two days to more than two weeks before an animal begins to show signs of the disease, which causes different but related symptoms in susceptible animals. Cattle develop fever and virus-filled blisters in their mouths, lose their appetites, lose weight and produce less milk. Pigs develop severe foot lesions that make it impossible for them to walk. In sheep and goats, foot lesions are less obvious and may go unrecognized, allowing them to spread the infection. In all species, adult animals typically recover within two weeks, but death rates among young animals can be high. 
Other susceptible animals include rats, deer and zoo animals, including elephants. Though people can be infected, symptoms -- usually skin lesions -- occur only rarely.
Although there are vaccines available against three of the seven varieties, or serotypes, of the foot-and-mouth virus, vaccination of farm animals has so far proved an ineffective means of control. Dr. Marvin Grubman, a virologist with the United States Department of Agriculture's Animal Disease Center on Plum Island, N.Y., explained that because currently available vaccines result in the production of antibodies indistinguishable from those provoked by the live virus, vaccination makes it impossible to tell which animals are infected and which are protected. 
Furthermore, current vaccines induce immunity for only six months or so, and vaccinated animals can become carriers of the virus even if they do not become sick. Vaccinated cattle that acquire the virus may harbor infectious virus in their mouths and throats for up to 30 months, and vaccinated sheep can become similar viral vectors for nine months.
Plum Island, off Orient Point, Long Island, is a highly secure installation and the only place in the United States where researchers are allowed to work with foot-and-mouth virus. Dr. Grubman said researchers there were "working to develop an improved vaccine, one that induces antibodies to some but not all of the viral proteins." Such a vaccine would make it possible to differentiate between infected and vaccinated animals. 
In limited tests to date, a new vaccine has been effective in preventing infection with live virus, but many more tests are needed, Dr. Grubman said. 
The disease has been kept out of the United States for more than 70 years, and neither Canada nor Mexico has had an outbreak since the 1950's.
But a single case would instantly shut down the export of all animal products, a $60 billion industry. Dr. Amy Glaser, virologist in the Diagnostic Laboratory at Cornell's College of Veterinary Medicine, said, "The U.S.D.A. is probably quaking in its boots right now," adding, "It's not a question of if the infection will occur here; it's when."

HEADLINE: U.S. COURT RULING LETS CABLE GIANTS WIDEN THEIR REACH 

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN LABATON with GERALDINE FABRIKANT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 2 

 BODY:
A federal appeals court struck down a set of regulations today that had prevented the nation's largest cable companies from growing larger and broadcasting more of their own shows. The panel found that the rules had violated the companies' First Amendment rights to reach new audiences and to control their programming.
 The decision is a tremendous victory for AT&T and AOL Time Warner, the nation's two largest cable operators, which have spent years trying to get regulators, lawmakers and judges to overturn the rules, known as cable concentration caps. 
 But consumer groups criticized the decision, saying it would reduce competition in an industry already marked by consolidation, limited subscriber choices and prices that have risen far faster than inflation. 
The rules have prevented any one cable company from serving more than 30 percent of the cable and satellite market's subscribers and from providing more than 40 percent of its channels with programming from its affiliated companies.
In striking down the rules, the court cast a cloud over the government order that AT&T shed significant assets by May as a condition of approval of its acquisition of MediaOne, which would give it control of more than 40 percent of the cable and satellite television market.
The three-judge panel sent the rules back for reconsideration to the Federal Communications Commission, whose new chairman, Michael K. Powell, has voiced skepticism about the concentration rules. He declined to comment today, but has said previously that the rules may have outlasted their usefulness and has questioned whether they really promote diversity on the airwaves. 
Mr. Powell, a Republican who served briefly in the Justice Department's antitrust division in the Clinton administration, has suggested that that agency and the Federal Trade Commission are more appropriate places to consider concentration problems.
Other F.C.C. officials said today that they had not decided whether to pursue an appeal or simply rewrite the rules. 
Industry experts predicted that the commission would now loosen or eliminate the rules. They also said the decision might give the F.C.C. strong impetus to eliminate similar restrictions on broadcasters.
"This gives significant momentum to the questions Powell has raised not only about the cable concentration limits, but also the concentration caps on broadcasters," said Blair Levin, a former top F.C.C. official who is now an analyst at Legg Mason. "Broadcasters will say that if there is a free-speech problem about the cable caps, there must also be one for them."
Cable companies involved in the case hailed the decision.
"We're pleased that the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with the key arguments we presented in this case," said Jim Cicconi, AT&T's general counsel. And Ed Adler, a spokesman for AOL Time Warner, said: "We are pleased with the decision. It is a good day for cable operators' First Amendment rights."
But consumer groups said the decision would harm consumers by allowing the largest companies to grow bigger and by removing rules encouraging them to broadcast programs produced by others. They said the decision was a setback for independent producers of programs, who will no longer be guaranteed automatic access to cable channels.
"This is a big victory for cable monopolies and a devastating blow for consumers," said Gene Kimmelman, co-director of the Washington office of Consumers Union. "The monopoly power of cable companies will be further unleashed. It will send shivers through broadcasting and independent content producers."
The decision also appears to throw into doubt the F.C.C.'s prior order requiring AT&T to sell major assets as part of the agency's approval of its acquisition of MediaOne. 
In particular, the decision eliminates the regulatory requirement that AT&T spin off Liberty Media or sell its stake in Time Warner Entertainment. Executives at the companies said AT&T was still on track to sell its interest in Liberty Media, but some analysts predicted that today's decision could alter the terms of the negotiations, providing breathing room for AT&T, which had been negotiating under deadline. (The F.C.C. order had required the company to complete a sale of assets by May 19.)
As evidence that the two companies believe the spinoff is on track, AT&T said that Liberty's chairman, John C. Malone, might leave AT&T's board because of possible conflicts. But some people say Mr. Malone's dissatisfaction with AT&T's management under its chairman, C. Michael Armstrong, is also a factor. Indeed, Mr. Malone has reduced his and his family's holdings in AT&T stock by nearly a third. 
At the core of today's decision in Time Warner Entertainment v. Federal Communications Commission were a pair of concentration caps that Congress had given the F.C.C. authority to impose. 
One rule imposed a 30 percent limit on the number of subscribers that could be served by a cable company. And another generally prevented a cable operator from using more than 40 percent of its channels for programming produced by any affiliate. (Time Warner, for instance, had been required to reserve 60 percent of the channels on its cable systems, up to a maximum of 45, for programming offered by companies not tied to it.)
A three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reaffirmed the constitutionality of the law giving the F.C.C. the authority to impose the limits. But it struck down the F.C.C. regulations on the ground that the agency had failed to provide an adequate justification for them consistent with the First Amendment.
"The horizontal limit interferes with petitioners' speech rights by restricting the number of viewers to whom they can speak," said the court in an opinion written by Judge Stephen F. Williams and joined by A. Raymond Randolph and David S. Tatel. "The vertical limit restricts their ability to exercise their editorial control over a portion of the content they transmit."
The court said that since the regulations imposed First Amendment constraints, they could be upheld only if they advanced "important governmental interests unrelated to the suppression of free speech" and did not "burden substantially more speech than necessary to further those interests."
In adopting the regulations, the F.C.C. had said the rules would promote diversity of programming.
But the appeals panel found that the agency had not provided an adequate justification for the 30 percent limit, concluding that the record produced by the F.C.C. could at best justify a 60 percent cap.
The judges were even more critical of the programming cap, asserting that "the F.C.C. seems to have plucked the 40 percent limit out of thin air."
After the decision, the stocks of some cable companies rose. Cablevision jumped $3.95, to $80.69; Comcast, 22 cents, to $42.81; and AT&T, 37 cents, to $22.40. AOL Time Warner fell $1.94, to $42.06, on fears of the impact of a soft advertising market.

HEADLINE: Relief on the Streets of Westchester as Bus Service Resumes, for Now 

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. CHEN 

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS, March 2 

 BODY:
Bus service in Westchester County returned to normal today as striking drivers and mechanics suspended their one-day strike and resumed contract negotiations with management.
 As of this evening, there was no word on whether any progress had been made in the negotiations between the bus company, Liberty Lines, and the union, Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union. Throughout the day, both sides expressed optimism that an agreement was near. 
 Still, union officials suggested that if there was no settlement -- or at least significant progress -- by day's end, then its 726 workers would be prepared to resume their strike on Monday. "We're looking out for the public and our members, but it all depends on what management brings to the table," said Sancha Brown, an administrative assistant at the union's headquarters in Manhattan.
Before negotiations broke down on Thursday morning, union workers were seeking an 8 percent pay increase over 22 months to bring their wages up to the level of New York City drivers, while management officials had offered a 2.5 percent increase per year.
The strike idled most of the county's 400 buses and left 55,000 residents, including 6,000 schoolchildren, to find other transportation. Many students were unable to get to school, retailers complained about a drop in customers and many employees called in sick. The strike was particularly inconvenient for people at the lower end of the economic spectrum. About 6 percent of Westchester's residents ride the bus regularly, and 80 percent of them have a yearly household income of $35,000 or less.
On Thursday afternoon, Andrew J. Spano, the Westchester county executive, stepped into the dispute, declaring that he supported the Yonkers-based bus company and that the union was "making unreasonable demands and that Liberty's offer is fair."
A few hours later, the union announced that it would suspend the strike and resume negotiations. This morning, the two sides huddled at the Tarrytown Hilton for closed-door negotiations that were subdued when contrasted with the carnival-like atmosphere that filled the hotel on Wednesday night as drivers prepared for a possible strike.
On the streets of Westchester today, life appeared to be back to normal. The blue-and-yellow-striped buses in the Bee-Line system picked up and discharged passengers paying the usual $1.40 fare, said Geoff Thompson, a spokesman for the bus company. School attendance returned to normal levels in New Rochelle, Yonkers and other districts, according to Mr. Spano's office. And everywhere, riders said they were relieved that service had resumed.
Julio Paduani, 63, lost a day's pay on Thursday when he could not travel from his home in Yonkers to his job at a Tarrytown gas station. But with the buses running, he made it today. "I said, 'Thank God, thank God,' " he said.
Not everyone knew that the buses were rolling again. Danny Ross of Yonkers took the train this morning, then a cab, to his job as a busboy at the Tarrytown Diner. His return trip should be more economical , however: he planned to take his regular bus home, at one-sixth the cost of his morning commute.

HEADLINE: New Jersey's Housing Law Works Too Well, Some Say 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW JACOBS 

DATELINE: EMERSON, N.J., March 2 

 BODY:
It started out as a run-of-the-mill zoning skirmish over less than an acre of land.
 A local group of investors wanted to construct a 16-unit apartment building on a parcel reserved for single-family homes. The town's planning board, eager to retain the neighborhood's suburban character, said no. 
 But the developers knew they had a powerful weapon at their disposal. Like nearly 200 municipalities in New Jersey, Emerson had yet to file a plan on how it would accommodate low- and moderate-income housing, a requirement under the landmark state law commonly known as Mount Laurel. Under the law, towns that fail to come up with a plan can be sued by a developer, who is then allowed to construct four market-rate homes for each lower-priced unit built. 
In the realm of laws with unintended consequences, a chapter could be devoted to the Mount Laurel doctrine, a groundbreaking law intended to dismantle exclusionary zoning that has also become an engine for the kinds of development that some planning officials consider environmentally insensitive.
In effect, New Jersey's effort to foster low-income housing is colliding head-on with its ambitious plans to limit sprawl.
Created in 1975 through a ruling by the State Supreme Court, the Mount Laurel law has led to the creation of nearly 25,000 low- and moderate-income housing units, a figure that some critics have called inadequate. Others say Mount Laurel has been a disappointment for failing to spur integration in the suburbs.
In the case of Emerson's legal battle, the tussle over zoning escalated after a second group of developers who had been trying to build on a much larger piece of land joined the lawsuit. Now, to the dismay of local officials, Emerson, in Bergen County, may end up with 111 town houses -- most aimed at wealthy buyers -- on a 19-acre patch of woods that town officials have been trying to turn into a park. The issue is now in the hands of a judge, who under state law must place Emerson's housing obligation over its desire to preserve the last remaining stretch of open space in town.
"It feels like we're being held up," said Vincent Donato, a member of the Emerson town council who helped secure $7 million in state and county money to buy the land. 
Still, most advocates for low-income housing and social scientists agree that the Mount Laurel law is the most successful model in the nation for providing moderately priced housing throughout a state. "If you went into any other state and said, 'Open your shirt and show us whether your heart beats for the poor,' you would see it isn't beating," said Robert W. Burchell, co-director of the Center for Urban Policy Research at Rutgers University. "In New Jersey, it beats and beats in a regular way." 
But while they acknowledge the doctrine's success in giving the poor access to suburban living, others say it places the quest for low-cost housing over the need to preserve New Jersey's farmland and wildlife habitat, 350,000 acres of which have been lost in the past decade.
Stuart Koenig, the land use attorney for the New Jersey State League of Municipalities, said the state's admirable drive to promote economic diversity is inadvertently reshaping the landscape of dozens of communities and drawing more people to places that are desperately trying to retain their rural character.
"It's not that people are opposed to affordable housing," he said. "They're just opposed to the sprawl that comes along with it."
While they regret the spate of projects that replace fields and forests, state officials, housing advocates and even some environmentalists say that the court-ordered builder's remedy -- the mechanism that rewards litigious developers with additional market units -- is the only way to force towns to comply with a law that was largely ignored until the Legislature gave it teeth in 1985, when the remedy was created. 
"A lot of towns think they can bury their head in the sand and make Mount Laurel go away," said Sally Dudley, a chairwoman of the Coalition for Affordable Housing and the Environment, a group trying to persuade the state to give rural areas more flexibility in dealing with their obligation. 
Developers have eagerly embraced their role as the enforcers of the doctrine, aided by lawyers who have perfected the art of taking on noncompliant municipalities. Hill Wallack, a Princeton-based firm that has won more than 60 Mount Laurel cases in recent years, maintains a Web site that provides a step-by-step guide to cracking open vulnerable towns. A page on the site features a wallet filling up with dollars, while another provides a list of the 196 towns that are fair game and suggests that developers "contract for land in one of them, decide what you would like to build and sue." 
Henry A. Hill, a partner in the firm and designer of the Web site, defends his mission and his tactics. "I represent builders who are looking for an opportunity to meet their market," he said. "If they could build $100,000 to $200,000 homes, they would sell like hotcakes. But the way it stands now, towns don't want to give them that kind of zoning. Mount Laurel has been an amazing tool for change."
There are currently 47 municipalities trying to beat back Mount Laurel lawsuits, although recent history shows that most will lose the battle. Since 1985, judges have rarely ruled in favor of towns' efforts to keep builders at bay in such suits. While they have had 16 years to come up with housing plans, town officials offer up a variety of excuses for why they failed to do so. Some, especially small hamlets, said they did not understand the process or lacked the resources to hire professional planners. Other communities, especially those far removed from the state's growth corridors, said they never imagined they would be subjected to development pressure. 
In the case of Emerson, Mr. Donato, the council member, said the previous administration, hostile to Mount Laurel's low-income housing agenda, dragged its feet for years. By the time a new slate of officials, elected in 1999, began working on a plan, it was too late. "We were trying to do the right thing," he said. "But until you finish the process, you are at the mercy of bullying developers."
While numerous suburban communities are facing the penalty of a builder's remedy, it is rural areas where the impact is most pronounced. The Hills, a complex of 4,000 town houses in Bedminster that more than doubled the population, is often cited as the state's most visible example of what can happen to places that try to ignore Mount Laurel. The project, at the intersection of Routes 78 and 287 in Somerset County in central New Jersey, crawls across the face of a mountain that local residents had been trying to turn into a nature preserve. Still, many former critics now grudgingly praise The Hills for providing reasonably priced homes in one of the state's most prohibitive housing markets.
But the law, others say, pushes growth into places with no shortage of inexpensive housing. In Pohatcong, a farming community of 3,500 near the Pennsylvania border, town officials are resisting a developer who wants to build 528 homes on a corn field, all but 66 of them aimed at affluent buyers. Under a state-mandated formula, the town is only required to build 22 moderately priced units, but in settling the lawsuit, local officials gave developers far more.
Richard Forbes, a newly elected council member, said Pohatcong is paying for the sins of the previous administration, which was dominated by farmers eager to profit from the sale of their land. He said the project would mar the scenic Musconetcong Valley, double the school population and lead to a 25 percent tax increase, forcing out many of the area's retired residents.
With the average home price around $115,000, Pohatcong, he said, has no need for Mount Laurel-mandated housing. The developers have said they will price the new homes at $200,000 to $300,000. "You couldn't even find a house here selling for $300,000," Mr. Forbes said.
Michael King, an open space advocate whose group, Phillipsburg Riverview Organization, has been trying to stop the project, said that the city of Phillipsburg, just north of Pohatcong, is burdened with scores of vacant buildings. "We have plenty of housing that is going begging," he said.
Connie Myers, an assemblywoman who represents the agricultural portions of Warren, Hunterdon and Mercer Counties, has introduced legislation that would cut back the obligation for rural communities. Environmental and housing groups have proposed an entirely new system that would require new development to include moderately priced units.
The Council on Affordable Housing, the state agency that oversees carrying out the Mount Laurel law, is preparing to issue new housing requirements for each of New Jersey's 566 municipalities. Shirley M. Bishop, the executive director, said the council is considering proposals that might ease the burden on rural areas but she said there is little chance the builder's remedy will be abandoned.
The construction industry, too, has been unhappy with the process, but for different reasons. "We think the numbers are too low," said Joanne Harkins, director of land use and planning for the New Jersey Builders Association. If it was not for projects made possible by Mount Laurel, she said, almost no mid-range housing would be built outside of the state's urban areas. 
Mr. Burchell of Rutgers University said the discontent from both sides shows that Mount Laurel is working. "It's been a tremendous success," said Mr. Burchell, whose staff of demographers and statisticians helps determine the housing allotment for each town.
"A lot of communities want to shut their door on the poor," he said. "But if they don't comply with the law, they're playing Russian roulette. And ultimately, they're going to lose."

HEADLINE: Mortgage Rates Decrease 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 2 

 BODY:
 Mortgage rates edged lower for the first time in three weeks as consumer confidence fell, Freddie Mac said this week. Thirty-year mortgage rates fell to an average of 7.03 percent from 7.12 percent last week, while 15-year mortgages fell to an average of 6.58 percent from 6.69 percent, the agency said Thursday. 
Rates on mortgages that adjust yearly also inched downward to an average of 6.39 percent from 6.43 percent the previous week. A year ago, 30-year mortgages averaged 8.27 percent; 15-year mortgages, 7.84 percent; and the adjustables, 6.68 percent. Robert Van Order, Freddie Mac's chief economist, said mortgage rates were being affected by a decline in consumer confidence. Freddie Mac is a corporation chartered by Congress that buys mortgages from lenders and packages them into securities for investors.

HEADLINE: More Problems and Fewer Clients; 
Consulting Firms Are Hurting, Along With the Economy

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN D. GLATER 

 BODY:
At McKinsey & Company, consultants are trying to make the best of the current slowdown in business. While the firm has more experts available to work on projects than it did last year, according to Peter Walker, manager of the New York office, it has fewer new projects from clients. As a result, he said, McKinsey's younger associates are spending more time on internal and pro bono work.
 Similarly, some consultants at Accenture, formerly known as Andersen Consulting, say that they do not have any projects to occupy them, and others have much less to do than they did six months ago. 
 Consultants at firms large and small, old and new, are suddenly finding themselves with time on their hands. 
There is no shortage of challenges for them to try to help overcome, of course, especially in the e-commerce sector, which has spawned hundreds of new small firms that are now struggling to survive.
At the same time, established players need plenty of help in retooling themselves as providers of "e-solutions."
But consultants require not only problems to solve but also clients willing to spend. The slackening economy and the collapse of the e-business boom have caused many companies to cut back. This has forced consulting firms to shift resources to different kinds of projects, to look overseas for new business and to scale back their recruiting efforts as more of their existing employees remain in the nest rather than venture out on their own into the Internet jungle.
Clients, particularly manufacturing companies, "are becoming very cautious buyers of consulting services because they are a variable cost," said Stephen Sprinkle, global director of strategy at Deloitte Consulting, a unit of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu. "The number of requests for new work has declined. We're seeing that, and I think almost all the competition is seeing that."
Moreover, technology consulting firms are faced with heightened competition from big companies like I.B.M. and Electronic Data Systems, which are eager to take over operations for the growing number of companies that want to outsource their technology-intensive functions to cut costs.
Executives at the established consulting firms might have been pleased by announcements of losses, layoffs and restructurings at new-wave consultants, like Scient and MarchFirst, which grew explosively in recent years to help dot-coms and other businesses rush something -- anything -- onto the Web. Indeed, some analysts and consultants saw the suffering at these younger consulting firms as evidence that the larger, slower-moving firms had been on the right track all along.
But the traditionalists are not immune to broader economic conditions, either. Reliable information on profitability at consulting firms is not easily available because most are privately held. But A. T. Kearney, the management consulting unit of E.D.S., which is public, last week reported a 3 percent decline in earnings in the last three months of 2000, and only a 5 percent revenue increase for the year -- well below the industry norm, analysts said.
"No matter how you count it, it is not where we want to be," said Dietmar Osterman, chief executive at A. T. Kearney. The unsatisfactory results were largely caused by employee turnover that exceeded 30 percent during the first half of last year, when demand was strong, he said. Now, attrition is down to 12 percent -- but there is less to do, he added.
The same thing has happened at McKinsey and at most other consulting firms.
The current view in the consulting industry is that this slowdown is strictly short term, a result of clients trying to guess the direction of the economy before deciding how much they want to spend on consulting services this year.
"It slows down for consulting when companies are undecided as to what they're going to do," said Jack Sweeney, an editor with Kennedy Information, a company that tracks the consulting industry. "If they know they're in a recession, they'll hire consultants to help them cut costs. So things could turn around this quarter as companies realize, hey, this could be a recession."
Consultants say those swings in demand mean that over the long term, their business has become "relatively recession-proof," Mr. Walker of McKinsey said.
Maybe the economy's storm clouds will produce that silver lining this time, maybe not. But there are at least three reasons the slowdown's effects are already apparent, consultants said. First, attrition rates at the firms have fallen sharply as opportunities to abandon ship to join start-ups or to experiment with a new job have dried up. Second, clients -- caught by surprise when the economy suddenly went into a skid -- have scaled back quickly, sometimes even canceling projects. And third, the first three months of the year are usually relatively slow.
Several business school career placement offices, which did not wish to be identified out of concern for their students who are applying for jobs, indicated that several consultants had already decided to reduce hiring this year.
Consulting firms are also responding to the slowdown by moving some employees to overseas locations where business is better, Mr. Sprinkle of Deloitte Consulting said. For example, demand for merger-and-acquisition advising has increased in Europe and Asia, he said, while it has fallen in North America.
Demand has also fallen in the United States for large-scale projects helping clients use technology to manage and track bills and inventory, and to handle other basic business functions, said Scott Hartz, global managing partner for management consulting services at PricewaterhouseCoopers.
"Those businesses have slowed," he said, as companies have pulled back from ambitious overhauls of their back-office operations in favor of improving efficiency.
By contrast, client demand for help in designing systems to manage customers -- to automate call centers, for example, or to manage and coordinate product sales conducted via the telephone, Internet and retail stores -- is still increasing as companies put greater emphasis on cost-cutting and streamlining their operations in response to the economic slowdown.
Indeed, one way companies try to improve efficiency is by hiring consultants to perform routine technology operations -- what consultants call outsourcing. Outsourcing may help technology consulting firms offset declines in revenue from advisory services, but it also exposes the firms to competition from technology companies that provide outsourcing and consulting services of their own.
An example of an outsourcing project is Cap Gemini Ernst & Young's agreement, announced in late January, to provide data management services to four New York City hospitals for $350 million over seven years.
Outsourcing is appealing because it is sure to be in greater demand as clients try to reduce costs by shedding operations that are too costly or unwieldy to operate on their own, said Terry Ozan, chief executive of Cap Gemini's North American business. Approximately 17 percent of Cap Gemini's revenue now comes from outsourcing, Mr. Ozan said, and that number is expected to grow to as much as 25 percent.
"The primary reason is companies are more often than not trying to focus on what is really key and strategic in their businesses," Mr. Ozan said.
But while outsourcing is a growing business and a relatively stable revenue source, its profit margins are probably only around 20 percent, and traditional consulting engagements can carry profit margins as high as 50 percent, analysts say.
Outsourcing is a competitive business, too. Companies like E.D.S. and I.B.M., which provide technology consulting services and design and build hardware and software products, have made outsourcing a central element of their business strategies. At E.D.S., outsourcing accounted for about 77 percent, or roughly $14.8 billion, of revenue in 2000, a company spokesman said.
Even as the rest of the market is slowing, "our outsourcing business has a pretty strong potential," said John McCain, the president of the Internet consulting unit at E.D.S. Since clients view outsourcing as a way to save money, "they come reaching to us for alternatives."
Consultants are also threatened by computer makers who hope to provide consulting services to complement their hardware offerings. Hitachi bought the e-business consulting unit of Grant Thornton, a Chicago-based accounting firm, and Hewlett-Packard was on the verge of acquiring the consulting arm of PricewaterhouseCoopers until the deal fell through because of disagreement over price.
For I.B.M., outsourcing last year accounted for approximately $13 billion, 40 percent, of the revenue at the company's Global Services unit, said Douglas T. Elix, senior vice president of the unit. Consulting accounted for more than $10 billion. 
And this year, the Global Services unit plans to hire some 11,000 new people, a mix of consultants, engineers and managers with experience in software design and installation. So while pure consulting firms are becoming more cautious, their rivals are building up their muscles.
"We hired over 20,000 people last year," Mr. Elix said, "and we're still busy hiring."

DATELINE: HANOI, Vietnam, March 2 

 BODY:
After paying his respects to the embalmed body of Ho Chi Minh, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia left for home today showing some satisfaction that he had re-established Russia as a player in Asia. 
 With his visits to South Korea and to this citadel of solidarity with Russia's Soviet past, Mr. Putin settled important economic issues of Soviet-era debt, advanced Russian energy and transport projects that could reap significant benefits for Moscow over the next decade, and showed that he is able to play a constructive -- perhaps crucial -- role in defusing the region's most urgent security threat, the North Korean ballistic missile program. 
 But the Russian leader's foray to Asia, where two-thirds of Russia territory lies, also showed just how far Russia lags behind the region's other major powers, the United States, Japan and China, in playing a meaningful role in security and trade.
Where the United States maintains 37,000 troops in South Korea and conducts more than $55 billion in annual trade with Seoul, Russia is just starting; it hit the $2.5 billion mark last year. Here in Vietnam, where Moscow's profile once dominated, economic relations with Hanoi have been all but frozen by the impasse over Soviet-era debt while Hanoi's trade with the United States has reached nearly $1 billion and could expand greatly if Congress approves a trade pact completed in President Bill Clinton's second term. 
Although he has almost no capital to invest and no visible means to finance Russian exports, Mr. Putin has gotten down to business like a traveling salesman, looking for opportunities in India, China, Iran, Cuba and elsewhere, to clear Soviet accounts as best he can and move on to offer what he would like to sell so Russia can revive its dilapidated industries, especially those that he deems still competitive in the energy and military sectors.
And he has scored some notable successes.
One senior Western diplomat here said today that he was not at all concerned by the announcement that Russia was willing to resume arms sales to Vietnam. First of all, he said, Vietnam's once vaunted armed forces have become a "marshmallow" of neglect and deterioration. 
"I am concerned that the weakness of the Vietnamese military could stimulate mischief on the part of other countries in the region," the diplomat said, a not-too-subtle reference to China, which invaded Vietnam in 1979, after Vietnam had invaded Cambodia with Soviet backing.
"The military needs to be modernized, and the Vietnamese like Russian weapons," the diplomat said, adding, however, that "there is no way that they are going to sell any weapons until Vietnam has an economy to support their purchase." 
For Russia, clearing away the debt issue was a milestone in making its return to Vietnam -- however modest -- possible, the diplomat said.
As if to underscore that point, Vietnam's leaders today organized a rally of thousands of former Vietnamese students trained in the Soviet Union, some of them now senior members of the Communist Party here, to say farewell to Mr. Putin with cheers of, "Long live friendship!" in the hall still known as the Vietnam-Soviet Friendship Palace.
"I am glad that our relations, which have lasted already for 50 years, were not the object of serious changes," Mr. Putin said. He added that Moscow's aim would be "not to lose or betray our cooperation."

HEADLINE: Mexico Seeks Lower Fees On Funds Sent From U.S. 

BYLINE:  By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, March 2 

 BODY:
The money sent home by Mexicans who work in the United States -- $8 billion or more a year, by most estimates -- puts food on the tables and clothes on the backs of millions of families. But millions of dollars a day disappear in the process.
 The money vanishes in the form of fees paid for wire transfers, especially by people without the legal status to have banking or checking accounts. The fees have run from about 10 percent to 25 percent or more. 
 Now President Vicente Fox, in another border-busting initiative, is pushing to create financial networks to let Mexicans in the United States send money home with a computer click or a cash card, for a far smaller fee. Some systems are coming on line already. Some will cut the cost of a transaction to 2 percent or 3 percent.
That will let far more money, hundreds of millions of dollars a year, wind up in the pockets of poor people, and not middlemen.
The importance of remittances is hard to overstate. They represent about as much money as tourism generates in Mexico, and almost as much as oil. 
The payments go straight to some of the poorest people, buying the basics of life -- food, clothing and medicine -- and helping the more fortunate start a business or build a house. In many states, the remittances exceed all government spending. 
In the past, the party that governed Mexico for seven decades often looked down on its fellow countrymen, or paisanos, who left to seek their fortunes in the United States.
Mr. Fox, by contrast, calls those migrants "heroes" whose work makes a life-or-death difference for the families that remain.
On taking office in December, Mr. Fox created a cabinet post to represent the paisanos and appointed his close aide from his days as a governor, Juan Hernandez, to run it. He told Mr. Hernandez to start to work on developing new ways to help send the money home. 
And Mr. Fox has summoned business leaders from Mexico and the United States to his ranch this weekend to discuss how best to help the paisanos. They include executives from American Airlines, the 7-Eleven chain and the First Data Corporation, which owns Western Union, and the head of a Mexican-American business group that sued Western Union three years ago over its fees for remittances. 
Their remittances represent crucial income for the country, Mr. Hernandez said, adding, "So for anyone to not see the importance of the paisanos really is blind."
One of the many new systems was set up last month by the Texas Credit Union League, with help from Mr. Hernandez, who was born in Fort Worth, Tex. 
Maritta Bush, senior vice president of the league, said that "instead of having 25 or 35 percent of their money eaten up by fees," people could now spend far less to wire money from credit unions to 4,100 banks or pharmacies.
"The average remittance is $300, and people were paying as much as $80 or $90 by the time everything was said and done," Ms. Bush said. Fees were sometimes paid on both ends of the transfer and even in-between, as the company handling the transfer calculated the most profitable exchange rate.
"The sender might pay $30 up front," she said. "But the exchange rate is manipulated, and the agent in Mexico may have a fee, too."
For the same $300 transaction, the credit union charges $20.50, consisting of a flat $10 fee plus 3.5 percent of the transfer. 
Another system set to start within weeks, Trust Card, is the brainchild of 11 Mexican and Mexican-American business people. For $5, a person receives two cards compatible with most automated teller machines. An employer sends some of the person's salary by direct deposit to an automated clearinghouse. 
For a $3.50 fee, plus 1 percent of the transaction, the money can be withdrawn by a family member in Mexico, who has the second card.
For a $300 transaction, the fee would be $6.50, less than one-fourth the up-front cost that Western Union charged last year.
"That is my dream, that is my goal, to get the paisanos over there using the technologies that are very, very inexpensive, such as the A.T.M.'s," Mr. Hernandez said.
The new systems are already taking business from big companies like Western Union Financial Services Inc. and MoneyGram Payment Systems Inc., owned by the Viad Corporation, cutting into their market share and driving down their fees as the business of international cash transfers expands rapidly. 
Without admitting liability, the two industry leaders recently settled suits over the cost of sending money to Mexico by giving discount coupons to customers and making big contributions to Mexican-American community groups in the United States. 
A month ago, MoneyGram started a new program to let customers transfer any amount to Mexico for a flat fee of $15. By comparison, last year, Western Union was charging a basic $27 for a $300 transaction.
Saving the paisanos' money is a way of thanking them, Mr. Hernandez said. 
"They go to the United States, make money and then send money directly to the families that need it most," he said. "If we had wanted to create an economic program that was more efficient than this, it would be impossible."

New Israeli Defense Minister
The Labor Party, which is entering a coalition government with the Likud Party, chose Benjamin Ben-Eliezer, a former general who was born in Iraq, to be defense minister. Although Mr. Ben-Eliezer is a party colleague of Shimon Peres, who is to be foreign minister, he is considered closer ideologically to Prime Minister-elect Ariel Sharon, the Likud leader. A1

Last-Ditch Bid to Save Buddhas
The United Nations led an 11th-hour drive to save two towering statues of Buddha in Bamiyam, Afghanistan, as the country's leaders, the Taliban, assembled explosives at the sites to obliterate them in keeping with the movement leader's strict interpretation of Islamic law banning idols. A3

To scholars of Asian art, the destruction of the Bamiyam Buddhas would be catastrophic. Apart from Bamiyan's rarity as one of the few examples of monumental Buddhist sculpture, it holds a key to countless questions about how Buddhism developed internally and influenced virtually every culture in Asia.

ZIMBABWE: EASING STANCE ON JUDGE
Backing away from their threats, government officials agreed to allow the Supreme Court's chief justice, Anthony Gubbay, to remain in his position until the end of June, his lawyer said. Officials had threatened to force Mr. Gubbay out on Thursday, instead of in June as previously agreed. Mr. Gubbay agreed to quit in June -- 10 months before his scheduled retirement -- because officials said they could not guarantee his safety from government-backed militants who have threatened judges for ordering black squatters to end occupation of white-owned farms.

HEADLINE: Salvadorans Illegally in U.S. Are Given Protected Status 

BYLINE:  By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 2 

 BODY:
President Bush agreed today to allow as many as 150,000 Salvadorans to remain in the United States for up to 18 months to help El Salvador recover from a series of devastating earthquakes earlier this year. Most of the Salvadorans are in this country without legal visas or work permits.
 President Francisco Flores of El Salvador had requested that the administration grant "temporary protected status" to thousands of his countrymen living illegally here, saying that money they earn in the United States and send to relatives back home would be as valuable to rebuilding efforts as increased American aid. 
 In a meeting with Mr. Flores at the White House today, Mr. Bush granted the request. 
"This will allow them to continue to work here and to remit some of their wages back home to support El Salvador's recovery efforts," Mr. Bush said after the meeting.
Mr. Bush also pledged a two-year package of reconstruction aid, $52 million this fiscal year plus the same or more next year, quieting critics who had complained that Washington had so far provided only $16 million in relief, about half of what Spain has given. 
"This is immensely important for us because it will allow Salvadoran families here in the United States to send their help to Salvadoran families in the devastated areas in our country," Mr. Flores told reporters outside the White House.
Temporary protected status would shield undocumented Salvadorans from being detained or deported for the next 18 months. It also would allow them to work legally. The 1.8 million Salvadorans living in this country send home more than $1.5 billion a year.
Today's action broadens a decision earlier this year by the Immigration and Naturalization Service to halt the deportation of 1,100 Salvadorans here since the first quake, Jan. 13. 
Two major earthquakes have caused nearly $3 billion in damage, an amount that is growing as aftershocks continue. The quakes have left about one in four Salvadorans homeless, Mr. Flores said.
Immigrant rights groups hailed Mr. Bush's decision as a compassionate humanitarian gesture. And in the wake of his visit to Mexico last month, those groups pronounced today's action a signal that Mr. Bush was making good on the pro-immigrant stands he articulated in his presidential campaign. 
"This is really the first opportunity the president has had to demonstrate that he was serious when he talked in Latino communities in the campaign about treating immigrants from other countries fairly and respectfully," said Cecilia Munoz, deputy vice president of the National Council of La Raza, an immigrant rights organization. 
Mr. Flores echoed the sentiments, saying today's agreements underscored Mr. Bush's commitment to a closer relationship between the United States and Latin America.
"He has given us concrete evidence that he is not only putting out his words, but his will, so that this will be a reality," Mr. Flores said.
Salvadorans are eligible to register for the program announced today if they have been in the United States since Feb. 13, the date of this year's second major earthquake, which killed nearly 300 people. 
Applicants are required to provide their names and addresses, be fingerprinted and pay a $50 fee. To apply for work authorization and receive a legal Social Security card costs an additional $100. 
Congress voted to create the temporary-protected status program in 1990, largely to grant temporary refuge to 200,000 Salvadorans who fled their country's civil war. Mr. Bush's father, President George Bush, extended their status in 1992. President Bill Clinton renewed the program a year later, but the temporary status expired in December 1994. 
In addition to El Salvador, residents from nine other countries are allowed to stay in this country because of dangers in their homelands from conflict or environmental disaster: Angola, Burundi, Honduras, Liberia, Montserrat, Nicaragua, Sierra Leone, Somalia and Sudan. 
Salvadoran immigrants from Los Angeles to Washington praised the administration's decision.
Cristino Diaz, 39, a chef at a downtown Washington cafe who lives with his wife and 16-year-old son in Silver Spring, Md., said he and his family sent about $1,500 a month to cousins, aunts and uncles and other family members in El Salvador.
Mr. Diaz said he talked regularly to his family there, who relate tales of misery.
"There is no food," he said. "There is no work. The people are afraid to buy anything because they fear they could lose it in another disaster."
"The only source of income is the dollars" sent home by Salvadorans living in the United States, Mr. Diaz said.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Urges Caution on Spending and Tax Cuts 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 2 

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, urged Congress today to be cautious in parceling out tax cuts and spending increases, warning that the projected federal budget surplus should not be considered money in the bank.
 While restating his support for a substantial tax cut and acknowledging the likelihood that huge surpluses will come flooding into the government over the next decade, Mr. Greenspan noted that economists still could not fully explain the surge in tax receipts in recent years or the degree to which a falling stock market might darken the outlook. 
 "What if, for example, the forces driving the surge in tax revenues in recent years begin to dissipate or reverse in ways that we do not now foresee?" Mr. Greenspan said. "Indeed, we still do not have a full understanding of the exceptional strength in individual income tax receipts during the latter years of the 1990's." 
In an appearance before the House Budget Committee, Mr. Greenspan stuck closely to comments he made in January to the Senate Budget Committee in which he blessed a big tax cut. He said that without a tax cut the surplus might be so big that it would force the government to begin buying stocks and bonds on Wall Street in as little as five years, a development he said would be harmful to the free enterprise system.
But he sidestepped efforts by Republicans to elicit a specific endorsement from him of President Bush's proposed $1.6 trillion tax cut. And he declined to say how much of the $3.4 trillion national debt he thought was redeemable in the next 10 years, an issue of heated debate between the parties in the last few days.
He again raised the idea of tying any tax cut to steady progress in reducing the debt, suggesting that the tax cuts could be phased in to take effect as the debt fell to certain levels. Some members of both parties have supported such an approach as a compromise that might help Mr. Bush win approval for his tax cut, but the White House and the Republican leadership in Congress have rejected the idea.
Mr. Greenspan's appearance came as Congress prepared to begin writing its own budget plan for next year, amid growing divisions among Republicans about whether the increase in general government spending can be held to the 4 percent proposed this week by Mr. Bush.
After the release of Mr. Bush's budget on Wednesday, some prominent Republicans, including Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, suggested that a 4 percent increase was unrealistically low. 
Mr. Bush's budget would provide increased spending for education, the military and medical research, but would require cutbacks in most of the biggest cabinet departments to keep the spending increase to the White House's 4 percent target.
Frustrated that spending might increase faster than Mr. Bush has proposed, conservative Republicans said they would battle to hold the line, even if it meant a showdown between the House and the Senate over the budget. Mr. Bush said he, too, would work to hold the spending increase to what he proposed.
"That's caused some consternation, because in Washington the definition of a cut is that you haven't increased the budget as much as anticipated," Mr. Bush said in a speech to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Mr. Greenspan's support for a tax cut and his warnings about runaway spending have given Republicans a lift as they seek to push Mr. Bush's plan. But Democrats have seized on the Fed chairman's admonitions not to spend the surplus too soon to suggest that the president's tax plan needs to be scaled back.
Mr. Greenspan was also questioned about whether the Fed had brought on the economic slowdown by raising interest rates too much in 1999 and the first half of last year.
No, Mr. Greenspan said, the Fed had responded appropriately. He also said that inflation remained well contained, and that he had been deliberately ambiguous in an appearance before another House committee this week about whether the Fed might cut interest rates before its next scheduled meeting on March 20.

 THE HACKER ETHIC
And the Spirit of the Information Age.
By Pekka Himanen.
232 pp. New York: Random House. $24.95.
 It can sometimes seem as if the number of people who have speculated on the social implications of Linux, the free computer operating system collectively engineered by thousands of programmers worldwide, exceeds the number of people who have actually used Linux itself. Ever since the open-source software movement entered into the public consciousness in the late 90's, we've been awash in prophesies about the end of the Windows era and the birth of a less proprietary digital age. Together, the emergence of open-source software and the related Napster music file sharing system constitute the most significant technological development since the arrival of the World Wide Web.
Up to now, most ruminations on the impact of open-source software have limited their view to the computer desktop itself: does the stability of the Linux platform prove that open software development models are intrinsically more stable than the proprietary ones used by Microsoft? Is there an economic model that can support the development of free software? 
These are important questions, but they don't do justice to the most remarkable fact about the open-source movement: at the very epicenter of New Economy capitalism, something that looks a great deal like a wired version of communism has prospered beyond anyone's wildest imagination. While private companies are free to sell "flavors" of Linux, and to sell technical support, no one owns Linux proper. It belongs to the people. If the Web served as a launching pad for the Xtreme capitalism heralded in magazines like Fast Company and Wired, the launching pad itself was partly built by freely contributed collective labor. 
Itself something of a collaborative project, "The Hacker Ethic: And the Spirit of the Information Age" begins with the premise that the programmers behind the open-source movement (called "hackers" throughout the book) represent a "spiritual challenge to our time." As Pekka Himanen writes in his preface, "the hacker ethic is a new work ethic that challenges the attitude toward work that has held us in its thrall for so long, the Protestant work ethic, as explicated in Max Weber's classic 'The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism.' " 
"The Hacker Ethic" begins with a breezy prologue from the legendary programmer behind the Linux revolution, Linus Torvalds, centered on what he calls "Linus's Law." (His theory: people are motivated by "survival," "social life" and "entertainment.") Himanen, a philosopher of technology who teaches at the University of Helsinki and at the University of California, Berkeley, then presents a longer essay -- the bulk of the book, really -- on the core attributes of the hacker ethic, contrasting them with Weber's work and that of his modern disciples. The techno-sociologist Manuel Castells arrives in the closing pages to deliver a somewhat freeze-dried rendition of his grand theory on the difference between today's "network society" and the industrial systems of yore. 
Because Torvalds's contributions are so slender, and because Castells has presented his ideas elsewhere, "The Hacker Ethic" needs to be judged primarily on the substance of Himanen's argument: that the values associated with the open-source movement present a significant challenge to the Protestant ethic. While Himanen's text relies on almost no primary research in terms of interviewing programmers, his survey of the core components of the hacker ethic (which he calls the nethic) is as comprehensive and instructive as any to date. Unlike the dutiful labor of Weber's Protestant ethic, the nethic embraces flexible hours, creativity and a passion for one's work. The nethic also disdains monetary reward for one's achievements, preferring what the open-sourcers call Egoboo -- the respect of one's peers. While Himanen can present a strained image of hacker sainthood, he makes a persuasive case that the nethic stands in direct opposition to the Weberian tradition. 
But that opposition raises two questions. First, is the Protestant work ethic still a useful category in modern industrialized societies? Weber's theory had little room for today's frenzied leisure-time consumption. (Sunday was a day of rest -- not the day for PlayStation 2 and Old Navy.) We may be programming our TiVo's with time-management skills that would have made the efficiency expert Frederick Taylor proud, but surely there's a difference between using those techniques to tape episodes of "Temptation Island" and using them for crop rotation. The dominant culture may still be clinging to older, Weberian notions of labor-as-duty, but it certainly spends a great deal of energy persuading us to kick back and live a little on the weekend. Himanen avoids dealing with the prominence of today's consumer society by wishing it away with the old "false consciousness" dismissals: "Only when work uses up all energy and people are too tired to enjoy the pursuit of their passions are they ready to be reduced to the passively receptive state suited for television." In other words, that feeling you have of actually enjoying "Seinfeld" reruns -- that's just an illusion. 
But even if you accept Himanen's most optimistic scenario -- a band of impassioned hackers challenging the oppressive establishment -- the question remains: What does it mean for the rest of us? Can the playful, work-for-art's-sake nethic be transferred to the analog world? For anyone who is excited about the promise of the open-source revolution, that may well be the most provocative question of all, and Himanen has meager answers for it. "The hacker open model," he writes, "could be transformed into a social model -- call it the open-resource model -- in which someone announces: I have an idea, I can contribute this much to it, please join me! . . . For example, I could announce on the Net that I would be willing, once in a while, to help some elderly person take care of things. I can announce that kids can come and play at our house after school." 
This is a nice idea, but hardly a radical break from, say, a real-world bulletin board at a community center. Himanen has a powerful grasp on that strangely intoxicating contradiction that is open-source, but when it comes to potential extensions of that model, he falls short. You can't help being let down to find that a mainstream adoption of the hacker ethic might only make it easier to find a baby sitter for the kids.

 GUESS WHO'S COMING
TO DINNER NOW?
Multicultural Conservatism
in America.
By Angela D. Dillard.
245 pp. New York:
New York University Press. $26.95.
 One does not associate scholars with perfect timing, news-wise, but Angela D. Dillard's "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner Now?" could not be more of the moment. A rainbow arcs above a Republican White House. The desperate mummery of the Philadelphia convention has issued in something more honorable: a looks-like-America cabinet. George W. Bush said that the varied social identities of his early appointments were meant to send a message, namely "that people who work hard and make the right decisions in life can achieve anything they want in America." In other words, the importance of the dark skins and female bodies of those early appointments was that they showed how unimportant dark skins and female bodies are in America. The blackness of Colin Powell is important in that it shows the unimportance of blackness. To judge from Angela D. Dillard's book, this is the essence of multicultural conservatism.
"Given the extent to which the conservative tradition in America was shaped by racialist and outright racist doctrines," Dillard notes, "by heterosexual-patriarchal notions of gender and family and by xenophobic influences, the existence of African-American, Latino, women and homosexual conservatives is that much more fascinating." As her language indicates, Dillard, who teaches history and politics at the Gallatin School at New York University, writes within the style current among younger, left-liberal humanities scholars -- a timorous style that often sacrifices verve to caution, advancing gingerly toward rather legalistic formulations about human reality. Her choice of the word "fascinating" is also telling. Dillard makes it clear that she disagrees with conservatism, but she tries, successfully, to suspend judgment in presenting conservative arguments.
"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner Now?" is more valuable for its information than for its arguments. Dillard economically traces the roles of racial activism, feminism and gay liberation as foils and inspirations for neoconservatism, the New Right, the Moral Majority and the Christian Coalition. She meanwhile keeps an eye on the relations between these fired-up groups and the Republican Party, which they have sought to make their mainstream vehicle. Against this backdrop, Dillard analyzes the famous (Clarence Thomas, Linda Chavez), the obscure (Elizabeth Wright's black conservative newsletter, Issues and Views) and the in-between (the memoirs of the gay conservative Marvin Liebman).
Her main inquiries concern blacks and gays, the groups that represent the greatest threat to conservative colorblindness and family values. Blacks, in the conservative view Dillard presents, are the definitive race, and so the greatest obstacle to colorblindness and race-free individualism. Homosexuals, similarly, are the definitive nonheterosexuals -- yes, there is a circularity at work here -- and so the chief obstacle to a pleasing stability of male and female social roles. As Dillard persuasively shows, antigay feeling (and a related antifeminism) has been the cement, along common-enemy lines, for a cross-racial conservatism. And a certain distancing from blacks has helped to unite nonblack conservative groups. Blacks have not, like gays, quite served as a common enemy. But placing one's group at a distance from blacks, especially the black urban poor, has provided a common bond.
Dillard also takes some quiet glee in pointing out that the special legitimacy of prominent conservatives who are not straight white men derives from the "identities" they supposedly don't want or consider trivial. Clarence Thomas is black, Linda Chavez is female and at least nominally Hispanic, Andrew Sullivan is gay. Their opinions on issues relating to the groups with which they are identified gain credibility for autobiographical reasons. Dillard devotes one of her most absorbing chapters to conservative autiobiography.
I wish she had pushed at this point a little harder, because it hints at a neglected aspect of American history. Every one of the groups Dillard discusses has a long tradition of conservative separatism. African-Americans have sought various forms of protective isolation, informed by cultural conservatism, since the Revolution. The separate black church, though a complex and frequently riven institution, can be considered conservative, as can many of the Hispanic, Chinese, Korean and other "ethnic" churches. There have been many moments in the history of feminism when a separate, distinct female nature and heritage were considered worth conserving. And was that a gay ghetto we just passed, or a gay paradise? Leaving aside the question of straight white men, conservative identity politics is not an oxymoron or a subject for light irony. It is a longstanding fact of American life. And I would note in passing that multiculturalism, in the form of cultural determinism, has become fashionable in American foreign-affairs circles as well, following the early leads of Samuel Huntington, Francis Fukuyama and Robert Kaplan, among others. Here again, multiculturalism is not a new idea nor can it be considered left or liberal. 
There are glimmers of these American conservative traditions in "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner Now?" when, for instance, Dillard notes the debates in the 1930's among Mexican-Americans over whether to continue culturally separate and conservative institutions or to integrate. She also mentions the seeming paradox of black conservatives being against school integration. If anything, black conservatives, in Dillard's broad sampling, have at least as low an opinion of white people as their more leftward peers. The much-demonized "civil rights establishment" is daily accused, as the current ugly phrase has it, of crying Selma. But Dillard's conservatives go on about the federal government's "plantation" and the welfare "slave trade" and civil-rights-establishment "overseers." It is not so much that these black conservatives adore white conservatives as that they have expanded the scope of their rage to include white liberals. George Schuyler, the pre-eminent midcentury black conservative intellectual, described whites' belief in their superiority as "unalterable." This was, in a way worth pondering, a conservative statement.
I suspect Dillard neglects the deep roots of nonwhite, nonheterosexual and nonmale conservatisms in part because she fears that too much historical texture might give them legitimacy. Another reason may be that Dillard avoids considering white conservatism as such -- that is, how white conservatives have understood themselves in racial terms as opposed to how they have understood others in racial terms. To have added material specifically on white Americans might have made it easier to put nonwhite conservatism in context.
Beyond that, the emphasis of conservatism after the 60's was on changing rather than on preserving the status quo. It has often been remarked that conservatism over the past three decades has embraced free-market capitalism, a force that is about the worst enemy cultural conservatism can have (and against which generations of Southern white conservatives struggled). Less frequently noted is that evangelicalism, which Dillard identifies as, "arguably, the mainstream religion," is also not conservative in any preservationist sense; on the contrary, it wants to rock your soul. One of the few genuinely American traditions guarded by contemporary conservatives is to prevent the overreaching of the state -- which is, of course, a liberal idea, perhaps the liberal idea.
As for cultural inclusion, there is no conservative tradition to defend. There are traditions of cultural diversity. Arguments for slavery and segregation and expulsion of Native Americans and against woman suffrage all contended, in various ways, for the honoring, or at least acceptance, of cultural differences. But there is no conservative tradition of inclusion, and so, funnily enough, the Bush cabinet appears to demonstrate that it is the conservative party that doesn't have a past, has indeed broken with the past. While I wish that she had spent more time examining the true histories of American conservatism, Angela D. Dillard has contributed greatly to that work. It is a particularly necessary effort now, because while the Republican Party may think it has broken with the past, I expect the American past is not done yet with the Republican Party, or with any of us.

 THE RACE TO THE BOTTOM
Why a Worldwide Worker Surplus and Uncontrolled Free Trade Are Sinking American Living Standards.
By Alan Tonelson.
Westview, $25.
 Alan Tonelson opens on the streets of Seattle, where protesters startled the nation and provoked a national debate about globalization. Tonelson sides with the protesters in arguing that globalization has "plunged the great majority of U.S. workers into a great worldwide race to the bottom." Despite the booming American economy, he writes, in the past three decades real hourly wages have fallen for a majority of American workers and declined by 31 percent for those without a high school diploma. Tonelson, a research fellow at the United States Business and Industry Council, challenges many economists who contend that technological change is more to blame than trade. As corporations relocate factories to the developing world, he argues, competition with low-wage workers weakens the bargaining power of American workers, not only in low-wage manufacturing but increasingly in high-tech industries as well. Tonelson makes a strong case that the effect of outsourcing on American workers has generally been understated. Less persuasive is his proposed solution. Offering an essentially nationalist vision, Tonelson calls for the United States to dictate the terms of trade and to slow imports from the developing world rather than cooperate in global rule making. He also proposes that trade be linked to international labor and environmental standards that can help American workers by improving global working conditions. Although "The Race to the Bottom" fails to examine any positive aspects of globalization, it is provocative and should lead to further debate about how we should engage the global economy.

HEADLINE: Please Take Our Children Away 

BYLINE:  By Mary Rogan; Mary Rogan is a writer who lives in Toronto.

 BODY:
Late last fall, in a remote village in the north of Labrador, native leaders took the extraordinary step of asking the government to take their children away. "The safety of these children is the paramount issue," explained Paul Rich, Innu tribal chief, in a statement to the provincial government requesting the removal of nearly two dozen of the village's children. "The ongoing situation is drastic, and we need to take drastic measures," the plea continued. "We insist that these children be taken into care immediately."
 The children, residents of the village of Sheshatshiu, where 1,200 of the 2,000 members of Labrador's Innu Nation live, are addicted to sniffing gasoline. On most days before Rich's plea, they would stagger along the desolate gravel roads, beginning at dusk, sniffing gas from garbage bags and making their way to a camp deep in the woods outside of town. There, in groups as large as 40 or 50, they'd sniff gas until dawn. As the light broke through the trees, they'd shuffle through subzero temperatures toward home or the detox center in town, where they'd sleep off the effects of the gas. Some would vomit or pass out, and according to local health workers, several had become brain-damaged from the gas. In the past year, one 11-year-old boy died after setting himself on fire, and half a dozen others were severely burned after accidentally going up in flames. 
 The Innu trace their problems with poverty and substance abuse to government relocations that forced them to give up their nomadic way of life. They also attribute their current state to the chronic physical and sexual abuse their children suffered when they were forced to attend Christian residential schools from the 1950's through the 1970's. Today, more than half the 300 children in Sheshatshiu between the ages of 5 and 14 have sniffed gasoline, and at least 20 percent are regular users. It is a community where half of the adults are addicted to alcohol, 42 percent have thought actively about killing themselves and 28 percent have attempted suicide. 
In Davis Inlet, the other Innu community in Labrador, more than 200 miles north of Sheshatshiu, the statistics are even grimmer. Ninety of the 154 Innu children there are chronic gas sniffers, and children as young as 6 have sniffed gas at least once. The London-based human rights group Survival International calls the Innu, whose suicide rate is 13 times as high as that of the rest of Canada, "the most suicide-ridden people in the world."
The provincial government of Newfoundland, which governs Labrador, responded swiftly to Rich's request. Three days after the plea, on Nov. 20, government social workers were flown in to Sheshatshiu to assess the gas-addicted kids. With help from Innu community workers, social workers went door to door talking to parents about the plan to take their children from them and assuring them they would be taken to a place where they would be cared for. "Most of the parents understood what was happening and agreed with our decision," explained Paul Rich. "There were a few who didn't. But there was nothing else we could do. If the parents can't take care of these kids, we can't leave them in the cold to sniff and die." On Nov. 21, anxious parents huddled in the dark outside the town's alcohol-treatment center, waiting for a bus that would take 21 of the most seriously addicted children to a military base in Goose Bay, 25 miles down the road. Inside, the children were distracted with treats of soda and chips and the promise of pizza once they got to Goose Bay. Peter Penashue, the president of the Innu Nation, was there, talking with parents and telling them that everything was going to be O.K. "I looked at the kids and thought, We've come a long way in 50 years to fall this far," he would tell me later. "The sadness overwhelmed me." 
When the bus arrived around 7 p.m., the children were taken out one at a time so that they wouldn't run off. As it pulled away, they smiled and waved out the windows like Fresh Air Fund kids leaving the city for a summer in the Catskills. 
In Goose Bay, they were held in a barracks where half a dozen social workers cared for them. But beyond helping the children detoxify, the government has made it clear it has no long-term solution for them if they return to their ravaged community. Marilyn McCormack, the provincial director for Child, Youth and Family Services, says that in her 23 years as a social worker, the plight of the children of Sheshatshiu is among the worst she has ever seen. 
At first, the children were agitated and nauseated coming off the gas, and social workers could do little beyond providing the basics for them: food, clothing, lots of juice to satisfy the intense thirst that was a symptom of their detoxing. When they began to talk, what they said was hair-raising. They described beatings and sexual abuse at the hands of their relatives. They talked about wondering each day whether they would get dinner at night, about seeing their parents get drunk and beat each other, about witnessing suicides and friends setting themselves on fire. They spoke in monotones, and it's this deadness that McCormack found especially horrifying. "My children couldn't survive what these children have survived," she said. "I don't know if I could survive. And yet they have so little expectation that anything will change." 
Of the 21 children taken from Sheshatshiu in late November, 19 are still in the care of the government, and they are expected to be moved into foster homes or alternate living arrangements. Two of them have returned to Sheshatshiu.
In Davis Inlet, the transfer of gas-addicted children to the authorities has been considerably more difficult. Unlike Paul Rich in Sheshatshiu, Simeon Tshakapesh, the chief in Davis Inlet, has insisted on negotiating with the government before handing over the children. Tshakapesh has been accused by individuals in the government and in the Innu community of holding the children hostage to larger Innu demands -- requesting more money for Innu social services and demanding that treatment programs be run by Innu counselors who will emphasize native culture. One government official who insisted on anonymity said that the Innu in Davis Inlet also requested a guarantee that if doctors discovered the children had been sexually abused, no charges would be brought against the parents.
The degradation of the lives in Davis Inlet is impossible to exaggerate. There are about 100 houses there that are little more than shacks, their doors torn from the hinges and windows smashed. Several snowmobiles, from which children often steal gas, appear to have been set on fire, and outside of every house are mountains of garbage that have been tossed out of windows. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police office, at the foot of the village, is home to three officers, who, because of the stress of being here, work two-week rotations and then fly out for two weeks. 
The R.C.M.P. officers told me I wouldn't have to go far to find children sniffing gas. They're easy to spot, one of them said, because they don't put their arms in the sleeves of their coats. They hug the bags close to their chests and draw the fumes up through the collars of their jackets. The officers also said that sniffing gas is not illegal in Davis Inlet, so they are not allowed to take the bags away from the children. "All we can do is put them out when they set themselves on fire," one officer added.
Outside, about 200 yards from the police office, the road was full of armless zombies. Their sleeves swung loosely at their sides, and their chins were tucked tight to their chests. No one looked to be more than 10 years old. I expected they would run away from a stranger, but they approached me eagerly. When I asked the smallest boy if he was sniffing gas, he laughed and said, "Yeah." The air was saturated with the smell of gasoline, and the children shuffled along in large groups and in lonely pairs. When they spotted the photographer who was traveling with me, they laughed and pushed one another aside to get into the frame, shrieking: "Take my picture, I sniff gas. Take my picture, I sniff gas."
In mid-December, the federal government reached an agreement with the Innu of Davis Inlet. In return for the construction of a detox center in Labrador and a continued commitment to restoring Innu culture, social workers could fly in before the end of the month to assess the situation, and the government could take the gas-addicted children to a facility in St. John's, Newfoundland, at the beginning of the new year. 
On Jan. 9, 16 of the community's most seriously gas-addicted children, ranging in age from 10 to 18, were flown to St. John's. 
To date, 40 children have been removed from the town and put into treatment. Of the addicted children still in Davis Inlet, it's unclear what, if anything, will be done for them. At the time I write this, the temperature has dipped to minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit, and there are five feet of snow on the ground. The police officers are taking turns patrolling all day and night, trying to keep the gas-sniffing children from freezing to death.

HEADLINE: ART/ARCHITECTURE; 
He Captured The Soul Of Silence

BYLINE:  By DEBORAH SOLOMON; Deborah Solomon is the author of "Utopia Parkway: The Life and Work of Joseph Cornell" and a forthcoming biography of Norman Rockwell.

 BODY:
SOMETIMES the new sensation in the art world can be an old master. Just look at Johannes Vermeer, whose pictures of tranquil housewives have recently come into vogue. In 1995, in one of the most belated tributes in art history, Vermeer was given his first museum retrospective, which was seen in Washington and The Hague. In its wake, acts of homage keep proliferating; they include at least three novels and an opera from Amsterdam at Lincoln Center last summer ("Writing to Vermeer") in which the artist's comely wife belted out songs about art, love and the toxic effects of wet varnish. 
 And now we have "Vermeer and the Delft School," which opens at the Metropolitan Museum of Art on Thursday. You might not think of 17th-century Delft as the site of a radical art scene, but it did have Vermeer, a painter of such overwhelming genius that just being his neighbor was enough to get an artist into the show at the Met. It will round up 15 of Vermeer's paintings -- almost half of his impressively small output -- plus another 70 pictures by 29 of his great and not-so-great contemporaries. 
 What is it about Vermeer's pictures that allows them to speak so forcefully to the current moment? Perhaps it's a matter of noise, or its absence. At a time when we're inundated with a steady clatter of information, Vermeer offers refuge, rooms filled with the kind of intense silence that exists only in museums -- oops, make that monasteries.
Most of Vermeer's paintings are scenes of domestic life, and you can easily see him as a protofeminist. His women appear in rooms where they might read a letter, play a lute or sew a piece of white lace. Unlike earlier art icons -- the Mona Lisa, for instance, with her flirty smile and follow-you-anywhere gaze -- Vermeer's women are caught up in their own thoughts; they're self-sufficient and complete unto themselves. They can fairly be described as the first modern women in art because they're the first women to savor the pleasure of solitude.
That breakthrough could have happened only in 17th-century Holland, a secure, commerce-obsessed era when artists were no longer obliged to turn out scenes of saints and martyrs for local churches. Instead they painted genre scenes -- scenes of everyday life -- for a newly ascendant middle class. Suddenly, bony biblical personalities were out and chubby revelers at taverns were in, though Vermeer obviously had spiritual inclinations. His paintings import the emotional inwardness of early religious art into a mercantile age, while anticipating the modern taste that prefers introspection to action. 
Consider the Metropolitan Museum's "Young Woman With a Water Jug," that daydreamy picture from the 1660's. It shows a room where a woman stands in her royal-blue dress, gazing absently toward a window. Although she's holding a silver pitcher, her distracted expression suggests a suspension of her womanly duties. One imagines that she is taking a respite from a busy household, from bawling children and mounds of laundry. The space around her is a kind of clear fog -- deep, dense, enveloping -- and seems like an extension of her inner life. 
Vermeer's mass appeal is probably as large as van Gogh's, that other Dutchman with spiritual yearnings. For many of us, van Gogh's pictures were the ones that we fell in love with when we first started visiting museums. His high-strung, confessional tone has always appealed to adolescents, particularly those who are firmly convinced that they are the only isolated and poetic individual in their 11th-grade class. Vermeer's pictures, by contrast, are the emblematic pictures of our adulthood, when insanity no longer strikes us as desirable, and we crave quiet. No one captured silence more compellingly than Vermeer, with the exception, perhaps, of Giorgio Morandi, he of the humble gray bottles. 
Not that you can ever say definitively what's happening in Vermeer's paintings. "Girl With a Pearl Earring," which is in The Hague and did not travel to the Met exhibit, shows a girl in a blue turban glancing over her left shoulder, as if someone has just called her name. As she turns her face out of the shadows, the light catches the delicate luster of one of her white pearl earrings. Like other Vermeer female subjects, it is impossible to know who she is, where she is and what's going on. His paintings are narratives with missing plots, which is probably one reason that writers keep trying to sketch in the details. 
Among them is Tracy Chevalier, whose best-selling novel, "Girl With a Pearl Earring," invents an identity for the model in the painting of the same title. Here we meet Griet, a tilemaker's daughter from Delft who works as a live-in maid for the Vermeer family. Naturally, she falls madly in love with Vermeer, and her dusting and sweeping become suffused with desire. Yet she and Vermeer never consummate their relationship. He is presented as a sober, taciturn genius who thinks about nothing except Art, and the tone is one of muffled eroticism as Griet passionately grinds his pigments and tidies up around his easel.
"I don't think Vermeer was someone who would have hit on his models," said Ms. Chevalier, an American living in London. "There's a respect for women in his work that suggests he wouldn't have been lecherous."
It was inevitable. These postfeminist times demand a man as seemingly decent as Vermeer to fill the role of the artist-hero. Compared to Picasso, the archetypal modern artist who used his lovers as models and muses before discarding them like so many paint rags, Vermeer offers the illusion of integrity. His popularity may reflect a longing for a new type of artist: the gentleman artist, who keeps his hands to himself, or rather uses them exclusively to paint. 
In his own time, Vermeer was far less beloved than he is today. His life story, in which the gaps and omissions far outnumber the known facts, reads like a tale about a family man who was short on luck. Born in 1632, Vermeer never left his native Delft, a bustling town known mainly for its breweries, munitions plants and blue-and-white porcelain. He and his wife, Catharina Bolnes, had a typically large Dutch family, 10 children in all, and he did some art dealing on the side to make ends meet. Unlike his contemporary Rembrandt, an art star known throughout the Netherlands who relied on his many studio assistants to churn out portraits of the Dutch elite, Vermeer wasn't known outside of Delft. 
He died when he was 43, in serious debt, and his name was soon forgotten. He languished in obscurity for nearly 200 years, in part because his tiny output of just a few dozen pictures was not easily seen by arts patrons. In the days before museums, photography and the ready reproduction of images, artists who wanted their work to be widely known literally had to create enough work to fill the right walls; they gained exposure as their pictures appeared and reappeared in private collections and at auction.
Vermeer was finally rediscovered in the 1860's, though the reasons were not purely aesthetic. Theodore Thore, a French art critic and political radical, brought him international renown as a fellow leftie whose homey paintings seemed to ignore aristocrats and ennoble the daily life of the common man.
When did viewers finally wake up to the aesthetic perfection of Vermeer's pictures? Certainly by 1913, when Proust brought out "Remembrance of Things Past." The novel includes a scene in which Swann, a cultivated flaneur, is beseeched by his mistress, Odette, to meet her every week for tea. He wants out, and Vermeer is his alibi. ("He had pleaded pressure of work, an essay -- which, in reality, he had abandoned years ago -- on Vermeer of Delft.") Odette protests that she has never heard of Vermeer and asks whether he is still alive. The comment is intended to mark her as a ditz.
Vermeer has meant different things to different generations. While 19th-century intellectuals saw him as a defender of democratic ideals, 20th-century intellectuals saw him as a father of abstract painting. For much of the last century, formalist critics considered it taboo to discuss Vermeer's subject matter. They praised his pictures for their geometry of design and viewed him chiefly as a forerunner of Mondrian, who distilled Vermeer's orderly rooms into the Grid, that fabled rectilinear trademark of modernism. 
But such a classic formalist approach, which ignores the subject matter of a painting, now seems arrogant and incomplete. Vermeer wouldn't have the huge following that he does if, instead of women, he had painted bowls of fruit or highly refined flower pictures, as so many Dutch artists of his era did. His work has enormous appeal to the untrained eye, which isn't just a Philistine reaction. For all his superb technical facility -- the fine motor control that allowed him to cut facets of light and engrave reflections -- the response he inspires is essentially visceral: His radiant housewives move us because they're secularized madonnas, the Virgin Mary in a string of pearls, ensconced in a parlor with a checkerboard floor.
Vermeer has traditionally been described as the artist who took realism to its greatest heights. As everyone knows, he was interested in optics and experimented with a camera obscura, an apparatus that may account for both the blurred edges and photographic sharpness of his images. Even so, he had an idealizing imagination, and real life never looked quite like one of his domestic scenes. Real women are not as serene as the ones he painted, and real rooms are not nearly so calming (nor so dust-free). 
These days, the trend in art history is to downplay an artist's creative will in favor of social and political forces, and the Met show is no exception. It will ask us to consider a new Vermeer -- Vermeer the local guy, a colleague of Pieter de Hooch, Carel Fabritius, Emanuel de Witte and some two dozen other denizens of Delft. The show, according to a Met press release, will cast Vermeer in a fresh light by emphasizing the role played by "the sophisticated patrons of Delft" in a very 1990's effort to trace stylistic developments to economic factors.
Context is always enlightening, and it will be interesting to see whether the Met show succeeds in reinventing Vermeer as a product of his time. Yet to do so would be to flatten his genius, and I suspect we will continue to see him in more personal and ahistorical terms. To me, he's the painter who honored the sovereignty of women by giving them their own space -- pictorial space, that is. His paintings are beautiful to the eye because they bring us life as glimpsed through his eyes, eyes that found infinite pleasure in the sight of a room where a woman stands silently by a window.

HEADLINE: THEATER; 
A Troupe That Sought An Asian-American Role

BYLINE:  By DON SHEWEY 

 BODY:
THE Joseph Papp Public Theater's production of "Dogeaters" may be the most prominent showcase of Filipino talent in New York since Lea Salonga was cast in the title role of "Miss Saigon." But the community of actors appearing in Jessica Hagedorn's play didn't spring up overnight. It has been cultivated in large part by the Ma-Yi Theater Company, the 12-year-old Off Off Broadway group specifically devoted to developing plays about the Filipino-American experience.
 Founded in 1989 by six former students at the University of the Philippines, Ma-Yi has dedicated the current season to two plays by the widely admired 33-year-old playwright Han Ong, who in 1997 was the youngest artist (and the first Filipino-American) to receive a MacArthur Foundation "genius" grant. 
 The season opened in September with "Middle Finger," Mr. Ong's adaptation of Frank Wedekind's "Spring Awakening." A tough-minded portrait of the emotional and sexual torments facing two Filipino-American boys in a Roman Catholic school, the play was directed by Loy Arcenas, who is best known as an award-winning set designer. 
The cast included several gifted actors currently appearing in "Dogeaters" -- Ching Valdes-Aran, Mia Katigbak and Jojo Gonzalez -- as well as a number of fine younger actors, including Ramon de Ocampo, Orlando Pabotoy and Michi Barall (who is not Filipino but half-Japanese). In May, Mr. Arcenas will direct Ms. Valdes-Aran in Mr. Ong's new play, "The Watcher," a noir esque excursion into pre-Disney Times Square. The coalescence of so much seasoned talent in one place has made Ma-Yi one of New York's emerging theaters to watch. 
Ma-Yi takes its name from the pre-colonial name for the Southeast Asian islands that the Spanish named the Philippines. The company has its origins in the political turmoil that swept the country in the final years of the Marcos dictatorship. "We developed a theater company called Godabil that used vaudeville expressionism as a way of doing street protests," said Ralph B. Pena, who was one of the founders of Ma-Yi and has served as artistic director since 1994. "We got to perform in huge rallies for a million people, until the military started noticing our work." Mr. Pena said he was called to the office of Army intelligence and questioned; three weeks later, at the urging of his parents, he left the country. 
After finishing school at the University of California at Los Angeles, Mr. Pena landed in New York. By chance he reunited with some Godabil colleagues at a gay bar in Greenwich Village, and commiserated with them about the difficulties of finding work in the theater as an Asian-American actor. "I'd been working as an actor in New York and the regional theaters, mostly in American plays," he said over breakfast at Time Cafe in the Village before a "Dogeaters" rehearsal. "Or, I'd be the token nonwhite in Shakespeare or Chekhov, if the director felt adventurous. I got cast as Chinese, and I played a Korean. You never get to play your own ethnicity. Filipinos especially feel that. That got tiring."
At the time, Tisa Chang's Pan Asian Repertory, which itself had evolved from Ellen Stewart's embrace of international theater at La Mama E.T.C., offered the only major casting opportunities. So Mr. Pena and his Filipino friends decided to start their own company.
"At first, we asked writers we knew from the Philippines to send us material, and we translated it," Mr. Pena said. "But we quickly figured out that it didn't have the same resonance for people living here and that we needed to focus on Filipino-American writers if we could. There were only a handful of them. In the beginning, it was strictly looking at the immigrant experience of Filipino- Americans. Now, as with a lot of Asian-Americans, the second wave of writers aren't so focused on that particular story. If you look at Diana Son's 'Stop Kiss,' there are no Asian markers in that play. We're looking for plays that have more to say than 'I came here, and I got lost.' "
Like many idealistic young companies, Ma-Yi had its stumbles. After producing its first show for $1,500 in the auditorium of Local 1199, the union for medical workers on West 43rd Street in Manhattan, Ma-Yi rented the Astor Place Theater, opposite the Public Theater, for the next show and spent $30,000, which nearly capsized the company. 
Jorge Ortoll, a Columbia University business major and real estate manager, came on board in 1992 as executive director to provide economic stability. What really got the company on its feet was bringing in Mr. Arcenas to direct Mr. Pena's play "Flipzoids" in 1996. Born in the Philippines and trained in London, Mr. Arcenas had become one of the busiest and most respected set designers Off Broadway, so when he launched his directing career at Ma-Yi, he made sure that colleagues at the Public Theater, the Manhattan Theater Club, New York Theater Workshop and other theaters came to see his work.
"He created a buzz around the company among theater insiders," Mr. Pena said, and this industry stature led to grants that helped the company sustain itself.
Mr. Arcenas said: "Theater is about acting. The reason I started working with Ma-Yi was that when we were doing 'Flipzoids' we had a difficult time casting the boy. From that time on, I decided that I would pay specific attention to Asian-American actors and see what it's like to give them a chance to blossom.
"When we did 'Middle Finger' last year, the pool of interesting young actors had already widened by a big margin. It's comforting to know, but also disheartening because they're really given very few chances to take big roles. You don't become Hamlet because you're given the role. You have to build your stamina. You have to go through a lot of performances until you can be secure in such a lead role. People have to exercise the muscles."
Ms. Valdes-Aran is the kind of performer Mr. Arcenas is referring to. She has become one of the hardest-working actors in New York. In the last year alone, she has performed on Broadway in "The Wild Party," in Central Park in "Julius Caesar" and in the National Asian-American Theater Company's production of "The House of Bernarda Alba," as well as "Middle Finger" and "Dog eaters."
But it has been a long slow climb to this peak of employment. When she moved to New York from the Philippines in 1967, she worked as a dancer until 1980 and then tried to make her way as an actress. She was cast in David Henry Hwang's "Sound and Beauty" at the Public Theater in 1983, but roles for Asian women were few and far between. She gained experience by working (mostly for free) in colorblind productions staged by downtown directors like John Vaccaro, John Jesurun and David Greenspan. With the advent of Ma-Yi and its sister group, the National Asian-American Theater Company, she was able to undertake leading roles and show what she could do. She won an Obie Award for her performance in "Flipzoids." 
In 1989 Mia Katigbak was also a frustrated, underemployed actress. With Richard Eng, she founded the National Asian-American Theater Company to give Asian-American actors opportunities "to do the repertory we're not allowed to -- European and American classics done straight," she said. "When we're cast out of tokenism, or we do it in a Chinese accent or Japanese accent, that perpetuates stereotypes."
The company has earned critical praise for its productions of plays as disparate as "Long Day's Journey Into Night," "You Can't Take It With You" and William Finn's "Falsettoland."
A commitment to breaking cultural misconceptions and planting the seeds of cross-cultural understanding is what makes the National Asian-American Theater Company and Ma-Yi sister troupes. "We hold joint auditions sometimes and consult each other," Mr. Pena said.
"Ten years ago," he continued, "I could not cast a six-character Filipino-American play with all Filipinos. I like to think we had some small part in developing the talent pool, because it has grown. And we have a core audience of people who have stayed with us as we slowly got riskier with the work. Every time, people say, 'I can't believe you did that.' I hope they keep saying it."

HEADLINE: In the Region/New Jersey; 
Villagelike Complex to Replace 320-Acre Farm

BYLINE:  By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
THOUGH a 320-acre former dairy farm along Route 31 in Washington Township in Warren County has been eyed for residential development since the mid 1980's, not a single house has been built. But new owners, working with township officials, have carved part of the site into an 18-hole golf course and now plan to build a villagelike complex of 120 homes and 100,000 square feet of commercial space. 
 The first phase of building construction will be 96 detached and 24 attached houses, which will rise adjacent to the 250-acre golf course, Hawk Pointe, which opened last June. The residences are for active adults age 55 and older and offer social and recreational facilities and maintenance services like lawn mowing or snow clearance. 
 The $40 million housing component, the Reserve at Hawk Pointe, will be on 30 acres of the wooded site, which looks out at Point Mountain and is near Interstate 78. Pinnacle Communities of Millburn will develop the homes with the developer of the golf course, an investment partnership led by Richard Cotton of Franklin Township. Construction is expected to start this summer. 
Both groups will develop the commercial portion once two-thirds of the homes are built. The plan is for the retail stores and professional offices to be linked to the housing by walking paths.
The residential project is among the first active adult housing developments in the northern half of New Jersey. Such projects had previously been concentrated in Ocean and Monmouth Counties. It reflects a way to allow development with minimal adverse impact on the quality of life of existing residents, officials from the township and building team said. 
During the mid-80's, a developer proposed building 2,600 units on the site and sued the township under the state's Mount Laurel doctrines when his plan was rejected. (Under the doctrines every New Jersey municipality must zone some land for residences for low-income people. If not, they are vulnerable to lawsuits by builders seeking to build high-density projects.)
By the end of that decade a settlement was reached, reducing the number of homes to 350 and requiring the developer to contribute money to the township's affordable housing plan. But by then the developer had gone bankrupt and the site was taken back by the lender. 
In 1996 after a sale of the site to another housing developer fell through, the bank sold it for $1.25 million to the partnership led by Mr. Cotton, who owns a farm in neighboring Franklin and is involved in preservation efforts in the area. He said that after he had been unable to secure public money to preserve the Washington farm, he began working with the township, which by then had met its Mount Laurel obligation, "to develop the site in an economically, environmentally and socially" responsible manner. After a year of negotiations the township rezoned the site for the current project. 
"We would rather see the farm, but the golf course is better than more houses," said Michael A. Kovacs, a member of the township council and a former mayor. "This is the best compromise." The township also "negotiated for active-adult housing" because it will not have an impact on schools; and it also had considerable "input into the design of the project," Mr. Kovacs said, adding that the traditional-style houses will blend with the area.
INDICATIVE of the growing antisprawl sentiment in the state in recent years Washington, like other towns, has put in place more restrictive zoning. It has increased the size of residential lots in certain areas to four or five acres from two "to preserve the township's rural atmosphere," Mr. Kovacs said. It has also acquired 1,526 acres for open space and is working to preserve 300 more. 
Development in western New Jersey, as in other rural areas, is expected to become more constrained because the state is buying one million acres over the next decade. And through various initiatives, it is encouraging growth in urban areas, where utilities, roads and mass transit are in place. 
Mary Boorman, director of sales and marketing at Pinnacle, said her company became involved with the Washington Township project because the zoning was in place and "there are not many opportunities available to build an active-adult community on a golf course." 
With selling prices expected to range from just under $300,000 to just under $400,000, the homes at the Reserve at Hawk Pointe, each with 2,200 to 3,000 square feet, are considered big and expensive by market standards. The project is also one of the first high-priced adult communities in a part of the state known for its affordability.
William E. Becker, a housing consultant in Teaneck who focuses on active adult communities, said there are 5,500 adult housing units under way or planned in the state. The average unit costs $200,000, he said.
Among the most expensive are the 120 attached homes at the Four Seasons at Chester, which the K. Hovnanian Companies of Red Bank, the state's largest developer, is building on 60 acres off Old Chester-Gladstone Road in Chester Township in Morris County. In the year since sales began, 76 of the 2,100 to 2,900 square foot homes have been sold at prices of $389,950 to $456,950, Michael Villane, vice president of sales and marketing at Hovnanian, said most buyers are adding some $80,000 in upgrades to the houses. In general, he said, the buyers are scaling down from larger and more expensive homes in the area. 
Jeffrey Otteau, president of the Otteau Appraisal Group in East Brunswick, said there is a demand for bigger and more costly active adult houses and "the demographics are certainly in place to support it." 
STATE figures show that baby boomers -- people born between 1946 and 1964 -- make up 2.8 million of the New Jersey's 8.1 million population, about 35 percent. This year the first wave of boomers will turn 55. 
There are other factors stoking the active adult market and by extension the luxury end of it, developers and housing professionals said. Among them are that today people over age 55 have more money and prefer to retire closer to where they once lived or where their children live.
They are also able to sell their homes at a profit, John G. Udell, president of Weichert New Homes and Land in Morris Plains, said, adding that "they will continue to do well unless there is some economic catastrophe." 
Still, Mr. Otteau and Mr. Becker said the challenge for the Reserve at Hawk Pointe is not its concept, but its rural location. The question, both said, is whether it will support the project's high prices.
Though the median price of existing homes in Washington is $185,000, according to township figures, new single-family houses are selling in the $200,000 to $300,000 range. And just across the border in Franklin Township, Toll Brothers Inc. of Huntingdon Valley, Pa., among the state's larger developers, is building 80 homes with 3,000 to 4,000 square feet and set on at least one acre lots, priced from $387,000 to $454,000. Since sales began at late in 1999, 37 homes have been sold and prices have been raised $70,000 to the current level, said Wayne Patterson, a senior vice president at Toll.
He said while the prices may seem high for the area, they are $100,000 less than those for similar homes in closer-in Hunterdon County. 
That is also expected to be the case at the Reserve at Hawk Pointe, Ms. Boorman said, adding "we are creating a community and in turn value." 
A new home of equal size on a golf course in closer-in affluent communities in Somerset County would cost at least $200,000 more, if there was land available to build it, she said, stressing the lack of available alternatives in north Jersey. 
The market, she added, will be couples in Somerset, Morris and Hunterdon counties who are scaling down from homes worth $400,000 to $500,000 or more, but who do not want to compromise on size and open space or to migrate to south Jersey. She noted there are more than 100,000 people age 65 or older with median yearly income above $70,000 living in those three counties.
At the Reserve at Hawk Pointe the single-family detached homes will sit on relatively small lots of 7,000 to 9,000 square feet, with the larger ones backing up to the golf course or woodlands. Lots directly on the course carry a $50,000 premium. The attached houses will be in eight buildings, each with three units. 
All the one- and two-story residences will have two-car garages and front porches and the master bedroom will be on the first floor in most models. They will be clad in a combination of shingle, brick and stone. 
In addition to the golf course, planned amenities include a clubhouse and outdoor pool. Monthly maintenance fees, though not yet set, are expected to be almost $200 a month, Ms. Boorman said, adding that she expected to start preconstruction sales this spring and to take three years to complete the homes.

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/Westbury; 
A Tone of Small Lots, Trees and Diversity

BYLINE:  By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
AS the national economy has wobbled, the real estate market in the conveniently located, moderately priced cosmopolitan village of Westbury in central Nassau County has remained strong.
 "The economy may have slowed down, but we didn't feel it," said Eric W. Jackson, the branch manager at Century 21 Laffey Associates in Westbury. "In January things just took off and really started moving. It's a very good market, for sellers at least." 
 In a village offering good rail and road connections and convenient shopping, the housing stock ranges from pre-World War I dwellings in the old downtown area that sell for more than $200,000 to Post-World War II Capes built by William Levitt in the years before he built Levittown to more recent colonials in the Wheatley Villa section, where prices may go above $500,000. 
There are two condominiums: the 126-unit Westbury Terrace and the 62-unit Maple Arms, where a two-bedroom unit recently sold for $190,000. At the Post House, which consists of 12 two-story buildings with a total of 145 co-op units, two-bedroom units cost about $60,000. Two-family houses that sell for more than $300,000 are in the Breezy Hill section, near Old Country Road.
But a small-lot, single-family home on a tidily kept, tree-lined residential street best defines the village, which is distinct from surrounding unincorporated areas also called Westbury and not to be confused with the neighboring Gold Coast village of Old Westbury, with its large lots, estates and median house prices of more than $1 million. 
Nancy Ann Jarvis, a broker at Daniel Gale Associates in East Hills, said a recently listed 71-year-old colonial in the west village -- generally defined as the part of the village west of Post Avenue -- was listed at $289,000 but drew interest from six potential buyers, who bid the price above $300,000.
It was the kind of house, Ms. Jarvis said, that seemed to hold the greatest attraction for current buyers. "The older houses are very much in vogue right now," she said. "People want the high ceilings, the fireplace." 
But it is also convenience that sells here, Ms. Jarvis and other real estate professionals said. "People are particularly attracted by the easy commute to the city," said Tom Seidl, an associate broker at Century 21 Prevete in Plainview.
The Long Island Rail Road carries commuters from the Westbury station to Manhattan in comfortably less than an hour. Northern State Parkway, a major east-to-west thoroughfare, cuts through the village. Jericho Turnpike (Route 25) and Old Country Road bracket it on the north and south.
Shops and services line Post Avenue, the village's spinal cord and main commercial street, which is close enough for many residents to reach on foot. Roosevelt Field, a regional shopping mall, is a five-minute drive away, and South Shore beaches are within easy range.
"Locationwise, it's terrific," said Barbara E. M. Krampitz, who moved to the village from Queens 30 years ago. "I can walk downtown for basic services, the railroad is right there, and people take very good care of their homes. It's a very pretty community."
Mrs. Krampitz is the director of the Westbury Children's Library, where programs for children up to 12 years old include story readings on the first Wednesday of each month. The library, with 18,000 volumes, is celebrating its 75th anniversary. The village's adult library, the Westbury Memorial Public Library, is next door.
THE village, which is in the town of North Hempstead, tends the roads and handles garbage collection. Nassau County provides policing. A village recreation center offers after-school programs for children. An adjacent village park, though small, has a playground and benches. The village also runs weekday programs for senior citizens at a community center on Post Avenue.
The village and surrounding areas, including neighboring New Cassel, has a greater degree of ethnic and economic diversity that many other areas of Nassau.
"Westbury is a very international community," said Ghazi Y. Khankan, the director of interfaith affairs and communications for the Islamic Center of Long Island, which is in the village. "It's a tolerant community. We have all races, many ethnicities, and many languages are spoken in the area." 
The Islamic center, which draws members from the estimated 70,000 Muslims residing in Nassau and Suffolk Counties, is the site of the only house of worship on Long Island built from the ground up as a mosque. It opened in 1991.
There are about 100 students in kindergarten through grade 8 at the center's Crescent School, where instruction is offered in Islamic history and Arabic as well as in traditional subjects. Fees on a sliding scale range from $300 to $450 a month.
Most of the village is in the 4,000-student Westbury Union Free School District, which also includes New Cassel. About 69 percent of the Westbury High School graduating class of 2000 went on to higher education, a low percentage for a public school in Nassau County. The most recent College Board scores averaged 437 on the verbal test and 440 in math, both considerably below state and national averages.
The district has an early childhood center for half-day pre-K and kindergarten classes, a separate school for grades 1 and 2, two elementary schools for grades 3 to 5, and a middle school for grades 6 through 8. The state named the Powell's Lane Elementary School for grades 3 to 5 a school of excellence this year. 
Last spring voters turned down a school budget that would have raised taxes by about 12 percent, an increase attributed in part to the fact that enrollment has gone up by 5 percent annually for the last several years. As a result of the defeat, the district is operating under an austerity budget for the current school year.
Dr. Joan Colvin, an assistant superintendent, said Westbury had been implementing the Comer educational reform model in all grades since 1998. The program, based on the work of Dr. James P. Comer, a psychiatrist at the Yale Child Study Center in New Haven, encourages active parent involvement in schools and builds programs around children's needs, Dr. Colvin said.
The district offers advanced placement courses in a number of subjects. A special music program encourages students to take up stringed instruments in elementary grades and culminates with high school students performing in a special spring concert with the Brooklyn Philharmonic.
A small western section of the village is in the Carle Place school district, where 96 percent of the graduates in the class of 2000 went on to higher education. Most recent averages for the College Board tests were 515 in verbal and 558 in math, both above state and national averages. The enrollment is 1,525. There are two schools for kindergarten to grade 2, an elementary school for grades 3 to 6, a middle school for grades 7 and 8 and a high school. Buyers pay a premium for village houses within the district. 
The Westbury Friends School, a culturally diverse Quaker elementary school on a 17-acre village campus, has an enrollment of 175 students ages 3 through 12 in programs ranging from a three-mornings-a-week nursery school for $4,049 to full-day classes in grades 1 through 6 for $8,454. The school has a computer center, art studio, gymnasium and new playground facilities. Class size is limited to 16 or less. The school, whose mission is to "create in each child a sense of self-worth and a respect for the worth of others," is open to all.
St. Bridget's School, a Roman Catholic school with 520 students, offers a program for 2-year-olds and their mothers, a nursery for 3-year-olds, a half-day prekindergarten program for 4-year-olds, and full-day classes for kindergarten through grade 8. The school declined to discuss tuition.
With the exception of a standout Little League field and a small park near Jericho Turnpike, the village has little open space. But a major outdoor area, Nassau County's Eisenhower Park, is just south of the village boundary.
In addition, the 150-acre Old Westbury Gardens is just to the north in the neighboring village of Old Westbury. It is open to the public from late April through October. Visitors there may go inside the Westbury House, the turn-of-the century Charles II style mansion of the financier and philanthropist John S. Phipps, and walk in a surrounding formal English garden. 
The Westbury Music Fair, also just beyond the village boundary in an unincorporated area of Westbury, offers a year-round schedule of music and entertainment. The March schedule includes concerts by Johnny Mathis; Andy Cooney, an Irish singer; and O-Town, a pop group. 
The area that includes the village was once part of the Hempstead Plains. Two English Quakers, Edmund Titus and Henry Willis, were the first European settlers in the 1650's, and Westbury, named after Willis's hometown in England in the county of Wiltshire, soon became a Quaker stronghold and meeting place.
It remained agricultural until the late 19th century, when the seriously rich arrived and built mansions in what is now Old Westbury and in other parts of Nassau that became known collectively as the Gold Coast. Commerce sprang up along Post Avenue to serve the estates, and gardeners and other estate workers moved in. The village incorporated in 1932 and exploded with new houses and residents in the 1950's.
In years that followed, the village and surrounding areas became known for ethnic and racial diversity. "It's always been a multiracial community, and that has always been one of the things I like about it," said Mrs. Krampitz, the children's library director.

Gretchen Haynes, the assistant clerk for the Westbury Meeting, said events would include a Sunday school pageant, historic presentations and the introduction of a Web site with historic documents and photographs commemorating the Quakers' long history in Westbury and other parts of Long Island. The original Westbury meetinghouse stood until 1801, when it was replaced by a larger building destroyed by fire in 1901. Mrs. Haynes said the current meetinghouse is on the same site as the earlier buildings. She said Quakers from Manhasset, Bethpage, Matinecock and Jericho gathered for meeting in Westbury beginning in 1671 and by the time of the American Revolution were the fourth-largest religious affiliation on Long Island. "Of course we're not fourth largest now," she said, adding that church membership had been growing. Names of Quaker families that once attended meetings in Westbury, including Post, Hicks, Willis and Albertson, survive in the names of roads and nearby communities.

First Steps on Proposed Major Project in Norwalk

BYLINE:  By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
BEGINNING at the Maritime Aquarium in South Norwalk and running north along the Norwalk River, a linear park nearing completion overlooks an idyllic scene of swans mingling with Canada geese, seagulls and ducks as they bob for fish or waddle onto the wet shore.
 Reclaimed from 17 acres of rubble-strewn mud flats, scraggly uplands and the city dump, Heritage Park represents the first step in developing Riverwalk, a $350 million office complex that eventually is to include retail and residential elements. Riverwalk will cover 42 acres within Norwalk's Reed-Putnam urban renewal area of 70 acres bounded by Interstate 95, West Avenue, Washington Street and the river. 
 The project is within walking distance of the South Norwalk Metro-North station and directly off Exits 14 and 15 of Interstate 95. It is described by Joseph McGee, a vice president of the Southwestern Area Commerce and Industry Association in Stamford, a business organization for the part of Fairfield County that includes Norwalk, as just what the association advocates. "Growth eastward of Stamford," he said, "particularly in train station areas, takes the pressure off the highways." 
James Fagan, senior managing director of suburban real estate at the Stamford office of CB Richard Ellis, a real estate services company, calls Riverwalk "one of the best located projects in the county -- the best way to tap into the working population coming mostly from the north and east." His company will be the leasing agent for more than one million square feet of offices in the proposed complex. "There is a pent-up demand for office space of 100,000 to 300,000 square feet," he said.
Envisioned by the city in 1984 but sidelined by the recession, the scheme has the preliminary agreement of lawyers for the City of Norwalk and two developers: Fred F. French and the Spinnaker Companies, both of Stamford. Ahead lies a long succession of property acquisitions and applications to city boards and commissions and to city and state bonding authorities. Approval must also be obtained from the Norwalk Redevelopment Agency, which has oversight on everything within Reed-Putnam, named after two neighborhood streets. 
Gov. John G. Rowland has included in his budget a grant of $10 million a year over the next two years for infrastructure improvements to be made before construction can begin, including widening West Avenue by two lanes from Crescent Street to Garner Street and widening access and exit ramps at Exits 14 and 15 of Interstate 95. If approved by the Legislature, the first $10 million will become available this summer. 
The park, a work in progress for four years, will officially open in June at a cost of about $6.75 million in city, state and federal money. It contains a network of paved and rustic paths lined with trees, stylish street lights and an occasional information kiosk. A handsome fence encloses the lawns, and one riverside path ending at a large fishing pier will eventually be extended to downtown Norwalk, half a mile away. Encircling a hill over the capped landfill are ribbons of crushed clamshells soon to become borders for plantings of wildflowers. An amphitheater overlooking the river is planned, along with an ice-skating pond.
Timon Malloy, president of Fred F. French Investing L.L.C., has had an association with Reed-Putnam since the mid-80's. "We lived in Westport," he said, "and we were looking for new investment opportunities in the area." His late father, Edwin Malloy, president of the venerable Fred F. French real estate company in Manhattan, saw bad times coming and had liquidated French's portfolio of two million square feet of offices in New York and Georgia. 
"We started discussions with the city in 1986 but discontinued them until three years ago," Mr. Malloy said, "when we started talking again." Confident that current real estate fundamentals are sound, he said: "This is a long-term project. The deal will allow us to move forward now and for the next up cycle -- if there's a downturn."
With four acres acquired, he needs nine additional acres to make up three parcels on which he could build up to 1.15 million square feet of offices in four or five buildings with two levels of underground parking. Preliminary offers have been made to some of the almost two dozen homeowners and small businesses whose properties must be bought or taken by eminent domain, though no such acquisitions will actually be made until all approvals are in place. 
Compared with office rents of $40 to $45 a square foot a year in downtown Stamford, "we expect rents would be around $37.50," Mr. Fagan said, "including a first year charge of $1.50 a foot for taxes, insurance, janitorial services and heating that will increase in subsequent years." 
Al Mirin, a vice president at CB Richard Ellis, said, "French won't build prior to having a tenant." 
The conversion of a former 19th century lock factory opposite the aquarium is under way by Spinnaker. When completed, it will contain 100,000 square feet of offices and about 4,000 square feet of restaurant and retail space on the ground floor. The first tenants are expected to move in this spring as work continues on the building. The original interior brick walls and massive wood beams have been retained, and tenants will have two landscaped inner courtyards.
In partnership with Summit Development and Greenfield Partners of Westport, Spinnaker is also authorized to build 200 market-rate apartments overlooking the river, an unspecified amount of additional office space and shops and a full-service 200-room hotel on vacant land, according to Clay Fowler, president of Spinnaker. No details have been announced yet about this phase of the project. The partnership, called Maritime Place L.L.C., will invest about $100 million, while Fred F. French is to spend $250 million for environmental cleanup of its sites, demolition of existing buildings, relocation of displaced residents and businesses, land acquisition and construction costs. 
A five-story city-owned garage for about 720 cars to be built on North Water Street is intended to alleviate parking problems in the area, accommodating the aquarium and some office tenants. Jack Miller, Norwalk's chief financial officer, said an estimated cost of $11.5 million was authorized for the garage in the city's capital budget last year.
If all of the projects now under construction or planned in Norwalk come to fruition, the city could add close to two million square feet of new offices within the decade to the more than five million square feet it has now, filling what industry brokers generally estimate as pent-up demand for two million square feet of offices countywide. Some real estate professionals think some of the offices planned for Norwalk will be delayed or scaled back, although the city's vacancy rate for first class offices is currently 6 percent, a very low figure.
New construction in Norwalk includes a 255,000-square-foot building at Merritt 7 Corporate Park on Route 7, scheduled to open in the summer of 2002. The complex of 1.2 million square feet in five buildings was begun in 1978.
Sometime next month, after site plan modifications are approved, Building and Land Technologies, a development company based in Wilton, expects to start work on a 350,000-square-foot office building adjacent to Merritt 7, to be completed in the fall of 2002. "When we get some tenants for that building, we will start on a second 300,000-square-foot building on the same seven and a half acre parcel," said Carl Kuehner III, president of the development company. 
He recently completed Merritt on the River, a conversion of a 235,000-square-foot former Caldor's store on Glover Avenue into offices. "We build on spec with the help of lenders who are willing to spec with us," he said, noting that Merritt on the River is 95 percent leased. 
JUST north of Norwalk on Route 7 in Wilton, David Fiore, a senior vice president of the Davis Companies of Boston and Wilton, expects approval this month for Wilton Corporate Park on 30 acres. Two existing buildings are to be renovated and two new buildings are to be constructed for a total of 476,000 square feet of offices.
And at 20 Westport Road in Wilton, the Dreyfus Company's 335,000-square-foot building is 95 percent leased well before its scheduled opening in July. The tenants already signed up include News America Marketing Inc., a subsidiary of the News Corporation, with 110,000 square feet, and the Louis Dreyfus Corporation with 113,000. 
Meanwhile, two Stamford office buildings of almost 600,000 square feet each, proposed by the Dreyfus Company and Hines Interests and approved by the city three and four years ago, remain unbuilt. Dean J. Shapiro, executive director of Insignia/ESG in Stamford, said: "The issue is there's no single tenant out there that could fill the critical mass of 50 percent of the square footage to guarantee financing."
Mr. Fiore and many real estate professionals believe it will be years before ground is broken for Riverwalk's first building or for Blackrock, a similar $250 million office, housing and retail project with a new Metro-North train station in the town of Fairfield. "What's proposed and what's built are two different things," said Mr. Fiore. 
Edward Deak, professor of economics at Fairfield University, discounts such pessimism, saying: "We're looking at a vibrant marketplace in Connecticut, with unemployment down to 2 percent. All this space coming on line with no tenants tends to be a bit of a concern, but my prediction is that in January of 2002, everyone will be saying how surprisingly good things are."

HEADLINE: Deficit Hits Waterbury and Residents Try to Cope 

BYLINE:  By FRED MUSANTE

 BODY:
NO one should be faulted for leaving the tax collector's office in a funk, but in Waterbury, which recently levied special taxes to meet its municipal payroll, where the mill rate is poised to rise and residents have been hit with higher sewer fees, that is especially true.
 "I have heard complaints for years," said Christy Schade, a resident who had just left the tax collector's office on the first floor of Waterbury's city hall after paying her taxes one morning last month. "The taxes are outrageous." 
 Ms. Schade complained that residents of Waterbury pay higher taxes on their cars than taxpayers in other towns do, and that when the city was hit by a snowstorm in early February, no plows ever came down her street, stranding her at home. 
This has been a winter of discontent for residents in Waterbury, for whom those perennially favorite grievances, high taxes and questionable moves by city government, suddenly have reached Shakespearean proportions.
Since mid-November, each week seems to bring more, and worse, bad news. Although decades in the making, the city's financial crisis seems to have caught a majority of residents by surprise, leaving them stunned as deficits soared to a quarter of the total budget.
Next week, the State Legislature is expected to consider a state takeover of the city, including the establishment of a financial review board that would be similar to the ones imposed on Bridgeport in the 1980's and West Haven and Jewett City in the 1990's. It is a measure of Waterbury residents' anxiety that they are optimistic about the financial review board.
"We all have the same view that something has to be done," said Ms. Schade, reflecting the view of her fellow residents. "I am trying to get out of the city," she added. When her lease is up, she said she's moving to nearby Naugatuck or Watertown.
"You wouldn't print what I'd have to say," said another woman, who walked by declining further comment.
Waterbury has been limping along financially from month to month since November, when it was revealed that it had severe budget problems. Budget deficit estimates rose from $30 million to $40 million, to $50 million, and lately to $62 million, about a quarter of the city's $257 million budget.
To meet the city's December payroll, Mayor Philip A. Giordano borrowed nearly $20 million and levied a special 5.8-mill supplemental property and vehicle tax. The state also advanced Waterbury nearly $10 million in state education funding, which provided extra help.
According to a state government calculation, for the city to meet its budget obligations next year its mill rate would have to rise from the current rate of 74 mills to 111 mills, unless costs are cut somewhere. Stephen Markowski, a spokesman for Mr. Giordano, said a much lower tax increase was more likely, though the eventual amount depends on unknown factors including the size of union contract concessions, the powers a state oversight board might have to impose cost-cutting, and a revaluation of taxable property that is under way.
"We're looking at some mill rate increase, but it won't be 111 mills," Mr. Markowski said.
Mr. Giordano put the blame on previous mayors, who he said underfunded the city employees' pension fund for at least a decade and signed union contracts with what Mr. Giordano said were overly generous fringe benefits packages.
Then there are an imminent property assessment revaluation and a sewer fee that has more than doubled after a new sewer treatment plant opened last year. By state law, a revaluation was supposed to have been done in 1990, but the city was granted waivers by the state for eight consecutive years. Mayor Giordano has hired a company to perform one, but the prospect of a revaluation on top of a tax increase has just heightened the emotions of taxpayers.
City tax collection rates have historically been too low, but here again its bad luck held. A Florida company was hired to pursue delinquent tax collection liens, but the company itself went broke, tying up Waterbury's delinquent tax collections in federal bankruptcy court.
In the best of times, snowstorms are troublesome for Waterbury's narrow, hill streets, but the unexpectedly heavy storm on Feb. 5, which brought a foot and a half of snow, was especially tough. Although many residents, like Ms. Schade, thought the city's financial problems were to blame, Mr. Markowski, who also serves as the city's director of emergency management, said the storm's unusual fury, depositing up to four inches of snow per hour, was at fault. The financial problems did not affect snow plowing in that storm, he said.
In conversations with Waterbury residents about the city's fiscal difficulties, time and again their complaints were about the revaluation and the sewer fee, which has risen to an average of about $360 a quarter for a family of four.
Because they arrived in a bunch along with the fiscal problems, they seem to have had a combined psychological effect.
At Jimmy's Charcoal Kitchen, a luncheonette across the street from city hall, Dave Ryan, a postal worker, was at the counter picking up some coffees for himself and his co-workers when the subject of the supplemental property tax came up. The tax on his house and cars cost him $450 just a month after Christmas, he said.
"I have kids who have glasses and braces," Mr. Ryan said.
Like Ms. Schade, he would like to move out of Waterbury, but he can't. He bought his house in the northern Bucks Hill neighborhood 10 years ago for $110,000, but now he said he thinks he could only get about $80,000 because of the fiscal crisis. He said he wouldn't even break even.
Another customer, John Thursfield, moved to Naugatuck in December after he and his siblings sold their parents' house. Mr. Thursfield had lived in Waterbury for all of his 45 years, but said high taxes drove him away. The sewer bill was the last straw.
"We didn't want to live in Waterbury any more," he said, adding that he knows many other people who put their homes on the market.
Some people said landlords had also increased rents to help them recover their tax increases. At the West Main Barber Shop, Jimmy Crespo, who was getting his hair cut by Gino Rodriguez, said his landlord had raised his rent from $350 to $450 a month.
"I knew a couple of people who wanted to buy a house here," Mr. Rodriguez said. "Now they don't." 
Philip Nargi opened a restaurant, Circa Bistro, on Bank Street three weeks ago in one of the dozen commercial buildings he owns downtown. The supplemental tax cost him $13,000, he said, and combined with the sewer fee, the revaluation, and an impending tax increase for next year it all seemed too much to him.
"It's not good that we get hit with all of this all at once," Mr. Nargi said. "Where do they think all this money's going to come from? We're not in a high-income bracket here.
"I don't mind paying, but I don't think we should have a bomb dropped on us all at one time," he added.
Mr. Giordano said, however, that things are not as bad as they seem. The city's mill rate, tax increases, and rent increases should be put in perspective because Waterbury is one of the state's most affordable cities, he said. Its home prices and apartment rents are much lower than in other cities, and tax bills are based on 1979 property assessments and the bills average only $1,700 a year for a one-family house, he said.
"We were ranked No. 2 in the last Connecticut Magazine survey for the best bang for your buck in real estate," he said.
Many in the city are optimistic about its economic development prospects, which don't appear to have been affected by the municipal fiscal problems.
"There's almost a disconnect between what's happening and the business sector, which is doing quite good," said Bernard Lynch, president of the Greater Waterbury Chamber of Commerce. A new information technology zone, 40 blocks with access to fiber optic communication cables, is attracting high-tech businesses, he said.
Waterbury's two state senators, Stephen R. Somma, a Republican like the mayor, and Joan V. Hartley, a Democrat, both share the view of the mayor, the Chamber of Commerce, and many residents that the imposition by the state of a financial review board would be a positive step. It worked for other municipalities and it should work for Waterbury, too.
People expect to pay their fair share, but they expect accountability from city government, Ms. Hartley said. They hope to get that accountability through a state oversight board. Mr. Somma cautioned against rushing to blame either Mr. Giordano or the city unions for the problem.
"Everyone needs to be part of the solution," he said. "I think many people believe this in an opportunity to effect real change."

HEADLINE: Mohegans Deal a New Hand: A Fishery 

BYLINE:  By JOE WOJTAS

 BODY:
THE members of the Mohegan Indians tribe hope they will soon be recognized as much for their oysters and fish fillets as they are for their slot machines and blackjack tables.
 While public attention has been focused on the successful Mohegan Sun casino in Uncasville, the tribe is quietly entering the aquaculture business. 
 The Mohegans will soon purchase a lobster pound in Stonington with plans to raise oysters and clams. They will also raise tilapia, a fish raised extensively overseas, on up to a dozen farms in southeastern Connecticut.
The Mohegans also plan to build a processing plant to provide Mohegan Brand Seafood Products to upscale restaurants, many of them in the New York City area, as well as to supermarkets and to the casino's restaurants. 
The diversification from gambling into fish farming is not that much of a stretch for the Mohegans, whose ancestors survived by eating fish and clams from Long Island Sound and the Thames River.
"Shellfish and finfish have always been a part of out history," said David Fowler, a tribe member who is also a tribal planner. "In modern times we wanted to get some of that back so aquaculture seemed like a good way to go."
This is not the tribe's only current effort to diversify. The Mohegans recently obtained permission from the state to sell telephone service.
Leo Chupaska, the Mohegan chief financial officer, said the Tribal Council was constantly reviewing proposals for new business ventures.
"Gambling is the economic engine that gets us the bucks but we want to do different things," he said.
Mr. Fowler added that "diversity has always been part of our plan." 
"I know a lot of tribes say that but it's usually just hollow words," he said. "We've always wanted to pursue different ventures and evaluate different ideas."
Soon after the tribe opened its casino in 1996, Mr. Fowler said it began to consider establishing an aquaculture program. Other projects took priority, he said, and the aquaculture effort was put on the back burner.
"We got to the point, though, where we saw that the aquaculture industry was about to take off and that this would be viable," Mr. Fowler said.
Meanwhile, the tribe began leasing shellfish beds in Fishers Island Sound and Stonington Harbor over the last several years and now controls 1,300 acres of ocean.
"At one point we realized it was beyond us to take this project any further so we had to bring in an expert," Mr. Fowler said.
Twenty months ago, after an extensive search, the tribe hired Paul Maugle as director of aquaculture.
Mr. Maugle, a fish nutritionist, has spent more than 25 years working on aquaculture projects in 15 countries. The job was a homecoming for Mr. Maugle, who grew up in Norwich with members of the Mohegan tribe.
With the aquaculture industry growing at a rate of 15 to 20 percent a year, Mr. Maugle said this was a good time to go into business.
"We're also in marketing heaven," he said. "We're in one of the wealthiest corridors in the country, halfway between Boston and New York, and we don't have to sell people on this. They're already familiar with seafood." 
Connecticut oysters already have the reputation of being some of the best while tilapia is becoming increasingly popular, especially in upscale restaurants. Because they are local, the Mohegans will be able to provide fresher shellfish and tilapia to restaurants than their competition. Most of the tilapia used in the United States is imported from countries such as Taiwan, Ecuador and Costa Rica.
The tribe plans to start slowly, gradually increasing the size of its operation over several years. Mr. Chupaska said the Tribal Council understands that it will take several years before the $10 million project is in the black, but after that, he said, "We expect to do quite well." 
Mr. Maugle said: "This is a long-term investment, not a short-term one. It's nice to have an opportunity like this. Not many businesses would be willing to wait four years to make money." 
The Mohegans plan to convert the former Garbo Lobster Company property for the shellfish operations. They plan to start with eight million oysters and eventually build to a point of producing 20 million oysters. (The amount of clams to be produced each year is still undetermined.) While many of the oysters and clams will be sold to restaurants, the tribe will also sell prepackaged products such as "shooters," oysters in a shot glass with seafood sauce, which is then consumed with vodka.
J. Evan Ward, a University of Connecticut scientist and the former president of the National Shellfisheries Association, said the Mohegans were "using tried and true methods" to raise shellfish.
"This is certainly not experimental," Mr. Ward said. "They've done their research. Oysters are already extensively grown in Long Island Sound so it's good bet."
Mr. Ward said that the shellfish grounds the tribe will use have a good tidal flushing, plenty of food and are not subject to toxic substances or disease. He said the riskiest part of the plan is raising the seedlings in a hatchery.
Stonington officials have welcomed the Mohegans, saying their presence will bolster the Town Dock, home to the state's last commercial fishing fleet. Some commercial fishermen in Stonington say the prospect of a steady paycheck, good benefits and being home with their families each night is appealing and that they may contact the tribe about a job.
Some residents had feared that the new owners of the lobster company property would not use the site for a maritime-related activity.
"I'm glad to see it being used again in connection with the ocean," said Arthur Medeiros, president of the Southern New England Fishermen and Lobstermen's Association. "I wish them all the luck in the world with it."
The tribe will begin a pilot project to raise tilapia in about 18 months. The Mohegans plan to slowly increase the production of tilapia to a point where the objective is to have facilities on 12 farms in six years. The tribe also sees the tilapia project as a way to help some local farmers stay in business.
Eventually, the Mohegans plan to produce 3.6 millions pounds of tilapia each year. Fish farms in the United States currently produce 19 million pounds of fish annually, but that figure increases as the demand rises.
The Mohegans will provide the feed, technical support and training for the farmers, who will raise the fish in their barns, pay for labor and utilities and then sell the fish to the tribe. The Mohegans will process the fish and ship it to customers.
Although most of the fish will be sold as fresh fillets, some will be sold in prepackaged oven-ready meals, smoked, or as a mousse. 
Kevin Fitzsimmons, a University of Arizona scientist and an officer of the American Tilapia Association, said the Mohegans would have to identify niche markets and not try to compete with established producers in the large fish markets.
"Then they have a really good chance of being successful," he said.
Mr. Fitzsimmons said the Mohegans had the advantage of being close to large markets.
"They'll have to deliver the product really fresh to the back door of the restaurants," he said. "They can process the fish in the morning, deliver it in the afternoon and it can be on the table at night. That's the way they'll have to compete."

HEADLINE: Hospital Plan Accepted for Review 

BYLINE:  By COREY KILGANNON

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS 

 BODY:
FACED with the possibility of paying millions of dollars in damages to New York Presbyterian Hospital for delaying its development project, the City of White Plains has agreed to review a hospital plan to develop part of its land just east of the city's downtown shopping district.
 On Feb. 22, the Common Council, after being advised by its lawyers to cooperate with the hospital, voted 5 to 2 to have its agencies review a hospital plan to build two medical research buildings. The plan was rejected by the Council in July, along with a much larger proposal that included a residential-commercial component and parkland for the city. 
 New York Presbyterian has been making proposals for this site since 1983, but the city and community groups have long opposed a rezoning for commercial use. 
In November 1999, the hospital, after two years of extensive community outreach, unveiled its $300 million Millennium Preservation Master Plan. Nicknamed Plan A, it included new medical laboratory space, as well as 480 units of housing, 405,000 square feet of retail space and a hotel-conference center.
As part of the rezoning plan, the hospital offered to give the city 61 acres of undeveloped land for use as a park. Mayor Joseph M. Delfino hailed Plan A for the roughly $10 million in sales tax revenue it could generate for the city. He envisioned a "central park" for White Plains that would include eight ball fields and be three times larger than the city's next biggest park.
But some residents and most council members argued that the commercial project was inappropriate for the site and would siphon shoppers from the city's ailing downtown. Concerned Citizens for Open Space, a community group opposed to the hospital's plans, demanded at least 100 acres of hospital property for parkland.
Sensing opposition to Plan A, the hospital created a backup Plan B, which used only 19 of the 214 acres and needed no zoning change. This $200 million alternative included two 192,000-square-foot office and medical research buildings near Bryant Avenue. The plan included no park, and its nonprofit status provided the city little tax revenue.
The hospital needed the Common Council only to amend its special permit for the medical use of the land, a routine application.
On July 10, Mayor Delfino and Councilman Robert E. Greer voted to approve Plan A, but they were outvoted by the five other council members. After the Council also rejected Plan B, the hospital filed suit in State Supreme Court challenging the city's refusal.
This month, city lawyers concluded that they would probably lose the suit, which would cost White Plains millions of dollars in damages. They advised the city to settle by agreeing to review Plan B, a process begun with the Feb. 22 vote. Only two council members, William M. King and Rita Z. Malmud, the council president, voted against Plan B.
The mayor blamed council members for rejecting Plan A in July, and thereby losing out on parkland and sales and property tax revenue. Timothy Sheehan, a former member of the county planning board, also scolded the Council: "When 60 acres of land were offered to you, you yawned and spurned it. You had big chips on your shoulder. Now they will take those fields that could have been ours and cover them with buildings, brick by brick and floor by floor."
But in an interview last week, Ms. Malmud insisted that Plan A "came with a poison pill," the large commercial component. And she vowed to keep fighting Plan B, fearing a hidden agenda by the hospital, like the possible blending of commercial and medical uses. The hospital's plans are too vague for the city to determine whether they are appropriate, she said.
At the Feb. 22 meeting, Barbara Benjamin, a White Plains resident, said that an enlarged medical complex would turn Interstate 287 "into a Long Island Expressway parking lot."
But Constance P. Hildesley, the hospital's vice president for real estate, said that additional traffic to the site would not create congestion, and that plans included adding about 500 parking spaces in two garages. She called Plan B a prestigious, world-class medical center that would give an economic boost to White Plains and draw residential and commercial tenants to the area.
The hospital had gone to considerable expense and spent 18 months attending community meetings in an effort to create an acceptable plan, she said. But faced with too much resistance from the city, the hospital decided to pursue Plan B.
For Mayor Delfino, 68, a Republican, the demise of Plan A was especially disappointing. He is up for re-election in November, with Ms. Malmud as his likely Democratic challenger. As of last summer, he had envisioned that Plan A, along with the retail-multiplex project on the former Macy's site downtown, would revive White Plains and benefit him politically. While he has accomplished several other major development projects and lowered the office vacancy rate in White Plains, the two projects were cornerstones in his Phase 2 revitalization plan. A central park would have been his legacy, but now both plans have sputtered.
At the Feb. 22 meeting, he insisted that the city would continue to negotiate with the hospital for parkland. But he was not optimistic, and he spoke wistfully of the scrapped park.
"Every time I drove down Bryant Avenue," he said, "I could see children playing."

Rent Rules: Changes And Debates

BYLINE:  By JAY ROMANO 

 BODY:
WHEN the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal adopted amendments to state and city rent regulations last December, officials said that the amendments were intended to update the regulations to make them conform to changes in the law, judicial decisions and the division's policies and practices.
 And while most of the changes do just that, tenant advocates say that on some amendments that are potentially unfavorable to tenants the housing division may have overstepped its authority. Some of those amendments are likely to be challenged in court, but the division says it is confident the changes will withstand the challenges. 
 In one change, the subletting of an apartment has been added to the factors that can be considered when a landlord alleges that a tenant is not using an apartment as a primary residence. 
Another expands the list of individuals considered immediate family members of an owner who wants to reclaim an apartment for owner occupancy, and a third allows an owner of an apartment that has been deregulated because the legal rent exceeds $2,000 to rent the apartment for less without losing the benefits of deregulation.
(Three other disputed issues were covered in this space last week. They included changes in the way base rents are calculated when an overcharge complaint is filed; elimination of the prohibition against landlords getting more than one vacancy allowance during the one-year period between Rent Guidelines Board rent increases; and a prohibition against tenants charging roommates more than a proportionate share of the rent.)
David Ng, a Manhattan landlord-tenant lawyer, said he is troubled by the provision that adds subletting to the list of factors that determine whether an apartment is a primary residence.
"Listing subletting as a factor to prove that a tenant is not living in an apartment flies in the face of other provisions in the law that specifically permit subletting under appropriate circumstances," Mr. Ng said.
Historically, Mr. Ng said, the regulations provided that addresses on a tenant's driver's license, motor vehicle registration, voting records and tax returns could all be used as evidence that a tenant was not using an apartment as a primary residence. Other factors include whether the tenant paid city income tax and whether she lived in the apartment at least 183 days a year.
Now, he said, adding subletting to the list may result in discouraging sublets entirely.
"If a tenant asks me, 'Can I sublet my apartment without fear that the landlord will use it against me in a primary residence case?,' my answer is going to have to be: 'No. Not anymore,' " Mr. Ng said.
Marcia Hirsch, general counsel for the Division of Housing and Community Renewal, said that subletting was listed because under certain circumstances it is a legitimate factor to consider.
"Some people use subletting as a way to hold onto their apartment for as long as they can even though they may have no intention of ever returning," Ms. Hirsch said, adding that one condition for legally subletting an apartment is an intention to return after the subtenancy. 
"Just because you do everything by the book when you sublet an apartment doesn't necessarily mean you intend to return to it," she said. 
Ms. Hirsch said she is confident that the subletting amendment -- and scores of other changes adopted by the division -- will withstand judicial scrutiny. 
Mary Ann Hallenborg, a lawyer in Nyack, N.Y., who is also publisher and managing editor of the Landlord-Tenant Practice Reporter, a trade publication for landlord-tenant lawyers, said that another amendment expands the definition of a property owner's immediate family members for purposes of taking back an apartment for owner occupancy.
"The law now allows a broader class of family members," Ms. Hallenborg said, explaining that sons-in-law, daughters-in-law, fathers-in-law and mothers-in-law have been added to the list of immediate family members an owner can place in an apartment after a rent-stabilized tenant's lease expires. (Ms. Hallenborg said that only property owners who own their buildings personally -- as opposed to those who own them through a business entity -- are entitled to take back an apartment for owner occupancy.) Other landlord family members on the list include spouses, children, stepchildren, parents, stepparents, siblings, grandparents and grandchildren.
She said that another amendment -- one that reflects a change in the law made in 1997 -- excludes a tenant's nephews, nieces, uncles and aunts from the list of individuals entitled to succeed the tenant in a rent-regulated apartment. That list includes every relative on the landlord's list, plus nontraditional family members who are entitled to succession rights under certain circumstances.
Another change, Ms. Hallenborg said, allows a landlord to impose surcharges when the tenant is allowed to install appliances like washers, dryers and dishwashers. The amounts of the surcharges are to be set by the agency at a later date, she said, adding that the surcharges do not become part of the legal regulated rent and the appliance does not become a required service.
Colleen F. McGuire, a Manhattan tenant lawyer, said that another change in the regulations has to do with what is known as high-rent luxury decontrol. For the last eight years, as a result of changes in the 1993 rent laws, once the legal rent that can be charged for a vacant apartment exceeds $2,000, the apartment is considered deregulated. 
There has been some discussion, however, over whether the $2,000 decontrol trigger applied automatically when the maximum allowable rent exceeded that figure, or only when the maximum allowable rent exceeded that amount and a new tenant rented the apartment for more than $2,000.
That dispute has been settled in favor of landlords, Ms. McGuire said, by a provision in the new regulations that a vacant apartment is considered decontrolled when the maximum allowable rent exceeds $2,000, whether or not the apartment is actually rented for that amount.
The amendment means that a tenant who rents an apartment for less $2,000 a month could be renting a deregulated apartment.
Ms. McGuire said that tenants who pay less than $2,000 for an apartment that a landlord says is deregulated because it can legally be rented for more might want to ask the landlord, before the lease expires, to document the computations used to arrive at the $2,000 threshold. If the landlord refuses, she said, the tenant might want to consider taking the landlord to court.
"The courts have allowed the first tenant who rents a deregulated apartment to challenge the computations that allowed the deregulation," Ms. McGuire said. "And it doesn't matter whether the tenant is paying over $2,000 or not."

BYLINE:  By DEBRA GALANT

 BODY:
AT the core of it all -- the hype, the acclaim, the protests, the T-shirts, the billboards, the premieres -- is a sallow, sad-looking writer with dark circles under his eyes and a hangdog expression. And at the core of that writer is an Italian boy from New Jersey who was never good enough for his mother.
 Tony Soprano may be mobster as soccer dad. Indeed, James Gandolfini, who won an Emmy Award for his portrayal of Tony on the HBO series, recently bought an estate in Somerset. But David Chase -- a k a DeCesare, the creator of "The Sopranos" -- is just one more insecure writer. 
 "We had written ourselves into a corner," Mr. Chase, a product of North Caldwell by way of Clifton, said last month, explaining how he had pretty much used up his concept of a suburban mobster with a monster mother by the end of the first season. 
Apparently he turned the corner.
The third season of the widely acclaimed series begins tonight amid a storm of publicity and an almost equal flood of protest from the Italian-American antidefamation movement.
Yes, New Jersey's biggest cultural export -- about six million viewers are expected to tune in -- is a lightning rod for controversy. And nowhere do emotions run stronger than here on the show's turf.
On the one hand there are the fans -- O.K., a bit daft -- who treat "The Sopranos" like the home team. These are the people who will show up today at a pre-premiere baked ziti party at Mae's Pub in Clifton organized by "Soprano Sue" of Sopranoland.com. Part of the sport is hearing Tony ask Junior to hand over Bloomfield, or to spot on television a parking lot or bridge you pass every day. If Tony Soprano is a star, then those who live in Essex or Union or Hudson Counties are close enough to gather some of the magic fairy dust.
Then there are the others, for whom the geographic closeness to television's favorite mob family has the opposite effect. These are the Italian-Americans who are tired of hearing the "F word," who have spent all their lives cringing at the notion that neighbors think that just because they are Italian, they have mob connections. For them, the local scenery just adds insult to injury. These are the people who will show up today at St. Thomas Roman Catholic Church in Bloomfield, where Emanuele Alfano of Unico National, a service organization for Americans of Italian descent, will present the Mille Grazie Award to the Essex County Executive, James W. Treffinger, who last December banned filming in the South Mountain Reservation, a sprawling public park with lots of places to dispose of a body in a ravine or under dead leaves.
Oddly enough, Mr. Chase hinted at this controversy several times in the first season. In one episode, Tony's daughter asks if he's in the Mafia.
"There's no such thing," the mobster huffs. "That's a stereotype. And it's offensive."
He could have been writing the script for Mr. Alfano, who lately has been gaining some momentum in his campaign to use the blockbuster HBO series as an object lesson in the way Italian-Americans are portrayed in the media. But it is a skirmish in which the show does not have to pack a 9 millimeter to win.
Last month, for instance, no less than the Museum of Modern Art in New York screened the first two seasons' episodes and invited Ken Auletta of The New Yorker magazine to interview Mr. Chase. Billboards of "The Sopranos" extended family on a Jersey-Shore-like boardwalk have sprouted up at the entrances to the Lincoln and Holland Tunnels.
An around-the-clock market in "Sopranos" tchotchkes grinds away on eBay. And star-studded premiere parties were planned in New York and at the Pleasantdale Chateau in West Orange, where the crew could pay back all those who tolerated the trucks and the cables and the lights and the other inconveniences of the filming there.
All this has accompanied a last-minute frenzy by the "Sopranos" crew to finish filming the final episode of third season -- with attendant "Sopranos" sightings and autograph opportunities from Caldwell to Kearny. HBO, which has kept a Mob-like grip on the show's publicity, has meted out coveted interviews with Mr. Chase like drops of holy water.
As the cameras keep rolling, Dr. Alfano, a retired chiropractor, runs his campaign from an office in Bloomfield, where a statue of Venus de Milo offers a different statement on Italian culture. He contends the entertainment industry offers stereotypes of Italian-Americans as violent or uncouth -- either toting guns or shoveling down pasta -- in a way it would not dare to portray other ethnic groups.
"People look at that and say, yes, that's what Italians are," Dr. Alfano said.
Although Dr. Alfano says he does not know anyone in the mob, he says he has heard even they find the show offensive.
"They were upset by how they were being portrayed," he said. "A mob person would never have tolerated foul language at the table from the kids. And a mother trying to kill her son? Never in a million years!"
But as much as Dr. Alfano excoriates "The Sopranos" for perpetuating negative stereotypes, the show from hell is also the gift that keeps on giving. After all, along with e-mail messages, it is the best thing that ever happened to his media sensitivity campaign. Just two weeks ago, the show's latest advertising campaign gave Dr. Alfano a new opportunity to protest; he sent a letter to the general counsel of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey complaining about the "Sopranos" posters on PATH trains.
"A friend of mine said, 'It should go on for 18 years,' " Dr. Alfano admitted with a smile. "He said, 'Manny, we never got this much coverage.' "
THERE are many "Sopranos" fans, but none more devoted than a 40-year-old Clifton woman who calls herself Soprano Sue.
Soprano Sue, a k a Sue Sadik, was a geography major at William Paterson University, and she runs a courier service in Jersey City, both of which she credits for her talent in recognizing the Jersey locations on the show. "Locations are my thing," Ms. Sadik said. "That's what my degree's in. I drive all day. Then it became a game, picking out where everything was."
Not only can Soprano Sue identify all 22 locations in the show's opening credits, she has also made herself its No. 1 self-appointed paparazzo. She regularly uploads digital images of "Sopranos" shoots to a special page of her fan site, "Sopranoland.com"
The first time she stumbled across the site of Satriale's Pork Store, the Kearny location where Tony and his gang discuss strategy, it was like a revelation.
"I came over a hill and I look and, oh my God, I found it, I found it!" Ms. Sadik recalled recently. "It made my whole night." She considers the North Caldwell residence used as Tony's house on the show "hallowed ground" and refuses to give out the address because she doesn't want others to invade the privacy of its owner.
Soprano Sue has a coterie of fellow fans and other sources (including a well-informed auto body mechanic and a woman who lives in an apartment across from Satriale's) who keep one another current on the status of filming. One of her biggest coups was finding the substitute location used after Mr. Treffinger forbade filming in South Mountain Reservation.
"The crew members were betting whether I'd find them," she said. She did, in Harriman State Park in Orange County, N.Y.
Ms. Sadik keeps a wall of photographs from her "Sopranos" shoots -- including one with her and Mr. Gandolfini -- but her prized possession is the picture taken with her and Mr. Chase.
"Nobody has a hobby like mine," she said. "I want to get buried on the cemetery on Newark Avenue -- Jersey City Cemetery on Newark Avenue," she said, referring to the cemetery where the "Sopranos" filmed the funeral of the character Livia Soprano, played by the Nancy Marchand.
"I belong in there and everybody knows it."
When Mr. Treffinger denied "The Sopranos" a permit to film in the reservation, nobody was more surprised than Mark Kamine, the show's location manager. "We'd used Essex County property in the past," he recalled recently. "As long as safety procedures are in place, it's a rubber stamp."
Although initially the county cited a deer hunt as the reason for turning down the permit, Mr. Treffinger soon went on record saying that future permits would not be given for a show that demeaned an ethnic minority.
"This idea that because of the content of the show that it might be turned down, it never occurred to us," Mr. Kamine said.
Not that it stopped the "Sopranos" crew for long. Immediately, there were offers from private citizens and municipalities to film in other wooded areas, Mr. Kamine said. One offer came from the mayor of Oakland, who offered a local campground. But Mr. Kamine decided on Harriman State Park instead, largely because of a superior plot of pine trees. For its trouble, Harriman got a $10,000 donation from the show, Mr. Kamine said, and he estimated that the crew probably spent another $20,000 to $50,000 during its four days there.
It is hard to say exactly how much revenue "The Sopranos" -- a cottage industry in New Jersey -- brings the state. "It's millions of dollars," said Steven Gorelick, associate director of the New Jersey Motion Picture and Television Commission, whose job is to attract the film industry to the state. "It's an annuity for us."
Although New Jersey has been successful lately in attracting many big names in entertainment -- the directors Steven Soderbergh and Ang Lee both shot here on the same day last month -- "The Sopranos" is considered the jewel in New Jersey's show business crown.
It is not just cash, but the series' growing star power and its introduction of scores of New Jersey scenes into the popular culture. "It's become a national obsession," Mr. Gorelick said. "I'm convinced that it's raised the consciousness among filmmakers."
Michael Aaron Rockland, chairman of the American Studies Department at Rutgers University, who is a frequent writer on pop culture, sees the TV show as a sort of culture ambassador for the state.
"The 'Sopranos,' I think, have been part of the Jersey Renaissance," Professor Rockland said. "Wherever I travel, when people mention the 'Sopranos,' they mention it as if, 'Wow, you're from New Jersey. Look at you.' "
So just what is "The Sopranos," which many consider to be the best television series ever -- New Jersey's chief cultural export or ethnic embarrassment?
At the film commission, there is no question.
"You can't attract the film industry and then tell the film industry that they can only make certain kinds of movies here," Mr. Gorelick said. "Our position is we don't act as a board of censorship. We are strictly an agency of economic development."
But for politicians, who work both sides of the political street, the question is murkier, and they are not leaping at the opportunity to go on the record about it. Mr. Treffinger declined to be interviewed, but did speak through his director of policy and planning, Joanna Noonan.
"He says this is not a First Amendment issue because filming on county property is not a right," Ms. Noonan relayed.
The state's acting governor, Donald DiFrancesco, also turned down an opportunity to be interviewed about the "Sopranos." He did say through spokeswoman, Jayne O'Conner, that he had never seen the show.
"Based on what he's heard and read, his preference would be that it would be more accurate about its portrayal of New Jersey and not perpetuate some of the stereotypes about New Jersey and the Italians," Ms. O'Conner said.
Nervousness about "The Sopranos" extends to other institutions as well. William Paterson University in Wayne revoked a permit to shoot a scene there last year about the same time a professor was to deliver a lecture on Italian stereotypes in the media. And Seton Hall University in South Orange was reportedly embarrassed last month when a clip from "The Sopranos" was played during a basketball game at the Continental Airlines Arena.
UNICO National, the group most vocally opposed to "The Sopranos," is a donor to Seton Hall's Italian studies program, and its first vice president, John Alati, a Seton Hall alumnus, was at the game.
Another group walking a tightrope over the "Sopranos" is the Anti-Defamation League of the B'nai B'rith. Although the group is sympathic to the Italian-American group's outrage, it is being careful about getting into a gang war over a television show.
" 'The Sopranos' feeds into stereotyping," said Charles Goldstein, director of the league's New Jersey chapter. "A false negative stereotype, which can feed into bigotry."
But Mr. Goldstein added: "It is not a focus of the A.D.L. to object to entertainment. We live in a market economy. This is what the market will bear, and it's not illegal. People have to have freedom of choice."
IT WAS 36 degrees and raining, a chilling combination that made being outside for longer than a few minutes an exercise in misery. But that did not stop the locals in Belleville from standing vigil on the hill in front of Belleville Middle School, where they watched "The Sopranos" being filmed at the Cozzarelli Funeral Home across the street.
Since the filming was going on inside, all anybody could see were some police officers guarding the front of the funeral parlor, and production vans lining the street. But there were some minor thrills when the actors occasionally emerged. Debbie Sangemino and Sharon Capezio, both 46, were thrilled when they got a kiss from Michael Imperioli, who plays Christopher Moltisanti. Despite the weather, they stood on the hill for most of the day, and for their trouble also got to see Mr. Gandolfini, Edie Falco (Carmela Soprano) and Tony Sirico (Paulie Walnuts).
Mrs. Sangemino found out about the shoot a few days earlier when her daughter, who attends the middle school, came home with news that a school dance planned for that Friday night had been canceled because of the filming.
"I think it's wonderful that they came to the town of Belleville," said Mrs. Capezio, who was wearing a black "Sopranos" T-shirt. Neither woman was offended in the least by the show's depiction of Italian-American gangsters. "It's television," Mrs. Sangemino said. "It's fun. If you don't have to face it in your backyard every day, it's entertainment."
Paul Santos, a 32-year-old autograph collector from Scotch Plains, also showed up for the Cozzarelli shoot -- along with 2-year-old Paul Jr., who rode in a stroller outfitted with a rain shield. It was old hat for Mr. Santos, a police officer in Elizabeth, who had been to 20 or 30 different shoots. "This weather is nothing," he said, shrugging off the icy drizzle. Mr. Santos was in a good mood because he had finally scored an autograph from Edie Falco, the last major cast member whose signature he needed to complete his collection.
Peter Caternicchio, of Elizabeth, a 30-year-old phone company employee and aspiring actor, also showed up in the hope of being discovered -- just as he had last summer at "The Sopranos" open casting call in Harrison, which drew 14,000 wannabes.
Notes about the shoot were also passed back and forth on New Jersey Online's "Sopranos" chat board. In the etiquette of on-line "Sopranos" devotees, fans warned each other if they had a "spoiler" -- that is, information about the show's content that could "spoil" a surprise. According to the spoilers (don't read on, if you care), the funeral being shot was for Meadow's college boyfriend. An August shoot at the same funeral home was supposedly for Livia Soprano's funeral. Of course, that was not much of a spoiler, since Nancy Marchand died over the summer.
Mr. Treffinger may have deemed "The Sopranos" politically incorrect, but that will not stop Essex County prosecutors from tuning in to the newest adventures of Tony and Carmela tonight.
"There's a lot of people in our office that watch it," said Bob Laurino, the prosecutor in charge of Essex County's sex crimes unit. "I know a lot of people who got HBO to watch it."
One of six million people expected to watch tonight will undoubtedly be Mr. Laurino, who said he had a "love-hate" relationship with the show. Sure, Mr. Laurino, who grew up in an Italian-American home in Short Hills, knows that it offends many people. And as a prosecutor, he acknowledged that "anything that glamorizes organized crime is unfortunate." Still, he added, "it's pretty compelling viewing."
In addition to the Monday-morning water cooler conversation at the prosecutor's office, one of the people Mr. Laurino discusses the show with is his sister, Maria Laurino, who wrote the memoir "Were You Always an Italian?" (W. W. Norton, $23.95). Ms. Laurino, who admits being a "Sopranos" fan, said she admired the show for its subtle handling of issues of ethnicity in suburbia, and for its accurate use of dialect. Lately, she has become impatient with the protests against "The Sopranos."
"I think it's silly," she said. "If you don't like the way Italian-American culture is presented, come up with your own."
Another Italian-American who is an unrepentant "Sopranos" fan is David Bonanno, editor of The American Poetry Review, who grew up in Caldwell and now lives in Philadelphia.
"I think the show is so well written that it's not a stretch to talk about it as being Shakespearean," said Mr. Bonanno, who planned to celebrate the new season with a party. Mr. Bonanno, who has a prized "Sopranos" baseball cap, says the show allows him some vicarious thrills he does not normally get as a poetry editor. "It's pretend tough guys in North Jersey," he said. "It's like cowboys and Indians."
Mr. Chase made almost the same point last month at the Museum of Modern Art. Although the inspiration for the series was his own problematic relationship with his mother, Mr. Chase decided that setting that conflict against a mob story was inherently more interesting.
"They didn't do stories about chicken farmers," he said. "They focused on gun slingers."
It has become a truism that the Mafia story has become the latest incarnation of the western. Everybody immediately understands the format, so the creativity comes with each new spin.
But some Italian-Americans are quick to point out that the western is now considered politically incorrect too.
"It's doing the same thing to Italian-Americans that the western did to Native Americans," said Maria Mazziotti Gillan, executive director of the Poetry Center at Passaic County Community College in Paterson.
Yet, despite her intellectual opposition to the show, Ms. Gillan finds herself sucked in.
"Unfortunately," she said, "it's very well written. It's fast-paced. It's almost like a Greek tragedy."
But the taciturn Mr. Chase may find the compliments about his writing as reassuring as a peck on the cheek from Livia Soprano. After all, he heard the same thing for years -- from television executives when they turned down his scripts.
"They would always say, 'This is really great writing,' Mr. Chase told the audience at the Museum of Modern Arta. "And you'd know it's over."

HEADLINE: Exiles Find There's Life After Manhattan 

BYLINE:  By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
THEY are expatriates and exiles from Manhattan -- some native to the 13-mile sliver between the rivers, others who brought their dreams of career and exhilaration from the other boroughs, the suburbs or even more tranquil environs.
 With a confidence founded on the certainty of a loving if close-quartered family of seven in the South Bronx, George Cabrera knew from the age of 13 that, despite near-nightly gunfire on his block, he would someday join the ranks of the "go-getters, the lawyers and traders" in Manhattan. And for 10 years, he thoroughly enjoyed his bachelor pad, a $1,600-a-month one-bedroom apartment on 34th Street at First Avenue. 
 Courtney Clark came from a cottage in the woods on her parents' farm outside Lynchburg, Va. -- where, to her, the animals were "permanent lawn ornaments" -- her eyes wide for that job in public relations. "I decided I'd go for it in The City," she said, emphasizing the article. 
Now they, like numbers of other onetime Manhattanites, leave the island each night for apartments in less dear districts of the other boroughs, private houses in suburbanlike swaths of the city, or communities on other shores that offer gloriously detached views of the jagged skyline they left behind. 
The exiles have been forced from Manhattan by market pressures: by purchase prices that, despite the nation's economic jitters, have barely abated in the borough; by commonplace rents of, say, $1,500 or more for a studio. And, according to tenant advocates, by the weakening of rent regulations that, they say, used to mitigate those market pressures, but now encourage owners to push longstanding tenants out.
Mr. Cabrera, an equity trader, now lives in Jacob's Ferry, a town house development on the New Jersey side of the Hudson, where he looks back at Manhattan from the terrace outside his bedroom, contemplating how he won't get stuck in the tunnel when he climbs aboard the ferry for his 15-minute morning commute.
Ms. Clark, who used to rent a room in Harlem for $650 a month, grew weary of looking at downtown Manhattan apartments that were "like closets, with the shower in the kitchen."
"I was willing to pay up to $1,300, preferably a one-bedroom," she said, "but I wasn't going to live in a hole, just because I could afford it."
Ms. Clark now lives in a two-bedroom apartment in a private home in Astoria, Queens. And when her best friend comes to town in May, they will share the $1,600-a-month rent.
To be sure, the refugees miss living within the pulse-quickening pace of Manhattan, the vertical views, the bright lights, the museums and theaters, the barhopping, the panoply of choices in the Yellow Pages, the 24-hour deli down the block, the friends they left behind. Many use the word "wrenching" to describe the parting.
Just as surely, they appreciate the calm of their new communities, the "main street feel," as one of them said; the neighbors who offer more than a nod in the hallway. One said the folks next door actually helped carry in the couch. Many appreciate the ethnic flavors of their blocks: Greek-Italian in Astoria; Hispanic-Hasidic in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.
They like not being so cramped, the extra bedroom for the same price, lots of closets. They very much value not having to fork over three months' rent up front, sometimes equal to the down payment on an outer-borough co-op.
And certainly they are less lured by the siren sounds of the city.
BARBARA KLAR, who once lived in earshot of the traffic clog to the Holland Tunnel, has heard and seen it all. Hers is a fairly comprehensive casebook on the difficulties of the Manhattan market.
Ms. Klar, a jewelry designer, is owner of Clear Metals on Thompson Street in SoHo. In previous rental incarnations, she used to reside and metalsmith in one location -- not always according to code.
"I opened my first store in 1984 on Seventh Street in the East Village," Ms. Klar said, "a little shop, 500 square feet -- tiny, tiny, like a boat with a sleeping berth." Ms. Klar, now 47, lived and worked there, "even though that wasn't allowed." The five-year lease started at $500, with $50 increases annually.
But in 1988, the building was sold, and Ms. Klar signed another five-year lease with the new owner, starting at $650 and rising to $950. "The next lease, however, started at $950, jumped to $1,500 the second year, then $1,750," Ms. Klar said. The top rent was $2,400.
"When I signed, I said to him: 'I don't know if I'm going to stay, because business is down. If I want to, will you let me out of the lease?' And he said yes."
Soon after, Ms. Klar continued: "He began to boot the old rent-control people out of the building, and began renovating. He renovated above me, directly. I had leaks, the ceiling fell in."
So began a legal battle in which Ms. Klar claimed constructive eviction -- a legal term for landlord actions that interfere with a tenant's use of the property -- and the landlord claimed she broke the lease. Ms. Klar lost.
In 1991, Ms. Klar opened the store on Thompson Street. By then, she was subletting a friend's loft on the Bowery for $450 a month, with no lease.
Some friends not always being so friendly, she said: "Every time we turned around, the rent went up. By the time it hit $1,800, the end of six years, she doubled that, and I decided to look elsewhere" -- across the East River.
By then, with the upscaling of downtown Manhattan, SoHo artists were moving into Williamsburg. "Manhattanites think Brooklyn is so far away," Ms. Klar said. "I couldn't believe how close it is." She started looking at rentals.
"I found an incredible live-work situation, a huge open space," on Graham Avenue in Williamsburg, she said. "The owner wanted $5,000 a month, and three months' security, but no lease. That's $15,000, not counting $10,000 to renovate. I decided, that's a down payment on a house."
And then there it was: an L-shaped, linoleum-lined medical office with an antique X-ray machine in front and a two-bedroom apartment in the back on South Fourth Street in Williamsburg. The price: $250,000.
"It's interesting I ended up doing my work in a doctor's office because I like to think it's healing, giving people pleasure," she said. "And we healed the building, too, because now it's beautiful."
It was scary leaving Manhattan, Ms. Klar said, "the 24-hour accessibility for anything." What she misses most are the rooftops. "You know, hanging out on the roof on a hot summer night, the beautiful urban landscape, just sitting and looking at the sky."
Still, it was a "love-hate relationship," Ms. Klar conceded. "At my loft on the Bowery, traffic backed up from the Williamsburg Bridge to the tunnel; twice a day, two hours each time, horns were blaring, people screaming."
The manic Manhattan market has provoked screams in recent years. But tenant representatives say more than demand has caused the squeeze.
"It's really market pressure and the fact that the public policies and laws that historically mitigated those market forces have, in recent years, been substantially weakened," said Andrew Scherer, acting executive director of Legal Services for New York City, which represents poor people in civil cases, and author of "Residential Landlord-Tenant Law in New York" (West Group, 2001).
Mr. Scherer specifically pointed to a process commonly called luxury decontrol, which was enacted by the state under the Rent Regulation Reform Act of 1993 and continued in the 1997 rent law.
"Landlords routinely now, if there is a vacancy, can make apartment improvements that in many cases enable them to increase rents above $2,000 a month," Mr. Scherer said. "That exempts the unit from rent regulation." 
If the landlord renovates a vacant apartment -- perhaps remodeling the kitchen and bathroom and replacing the appliances -- one-fortieth of the cost of those improvements can be included in the monthly rent. If that one-fortieth increase -- combined with a "vacancy allowance" that is typically 20 percent -- takes the rent over $2,000 a month, the apartment is permanently decontrolled and the landlord can charge a new tenant whatever the market will bear. "This is happening very commonly, at this point," Mr. Scherer said.
At the same time, eviction procedures in Housing Court have been "ratcheted up considerably," Mr. Scherer said.
Morton Cohen, senior staff attorney at Harlem Legal Services, concurred with that assessment. "There are legitimate nonpayment cases," he said, "and there are those landlords who are just taking a shot that the tenant won't find a lawyer or will default, and maybe they will be able to get the apartment."
SO the squeeze is hardly limited to the more affluent areas of Manhattan. "There's tremendous pressure up here," Mr. Cohen said. "They want to get the rents on a par with mid-Manhattan." 
And that phenomenon holds true, Mr. Scherer added, "even though it may be shifting a little just in the last few months because of the real estate market softening a bit."
There was nothing mushy about the market 14 months ago when Jason and Annie Kantor, both 32 -- he a biotech stock analyst, she a textile designer -- began looking for more space after their daughter, Emma, now 2, began walking.
The one-bedroom in the high-rise at 36th Street and Lexington Avenue was just too cramped.
The Kantors are both from more spacious locales in California. "It was a unique experience for us, living on the 23rd floor with a big-city view of Midtown, the Chrysler Building," Mr. Kantor said.
Mrs. Kantor said they were not used to elevators. "It's ironic," she said, "because now our daughter doesn't know otherwise. She's uncomfortable on uneven ground. What could be worse for Californians than to take your daughter to the beach and she screams and retracts her feet? She won't even step on the sand."
The Kantors had been subletting the co-op apartment for $2,300 a month, with a jump to $2,600 in the offing. "It was a white-glove doorman building; odd for us, always somebody there to help with the bags," Mr. Kantor said. "But we weren't filled with any feelings of undue importance."
Mainly because the apartment was, for them, tiny. "Emma took over one of the precious corners, meaning in a one-bedroom you don't have that many corners," Mrs. Kantor said. "I sacrificed my knitting machine for the crib, and the computer station. We downsized from a whole computer table to a laptop."
And so the search began. "We started looking at both renting or buying in our neighborhood, Murray Hill, first," Mr. Kantor said. It soon became clear that full two-bedrooms would be out of their reach. "We saw convertible one-bedrooms -- those apartments with a dining alcove you can convert to a baby's room -- but they were close to $3,000, and not very nice."
Then Mr. Kantor's parents came to town. "We went to visit Brooklyn Heights for sightseeing purposes," he said, "and we fell in love with it. The old architecture -- it reminded me a lot of the Back Bay in Boston," where he had gone to college.
Resetting their sights, within a price range of $350,000 to $400,000, the couple looked at nine apartments in Brooklyn Heights. They placed an offer on a two-bedroom on Pineapple Street, but were turned down.
"We found this place right after, and we liked it better, so we weren't disappointed," Mr. Kantor said of the two-bedroom co-op on Hicks Street for which they offered the asking price, "the high end of our range."
Next came the New York City equivalent of the Chinese water torture -- the approval process. "The co-op was surprisingly thorough," Mr. Kantor said. "We needed something on the order of four or five letters of recommendation each, both personal and professional; obviously, all the financial details and finally an interview."
Even little Emma would be perused. "They asked us to bring everybody," Ms. Kantor said. "And she was on her best behavior, she charmed them. There was a big sigh of relief when we made it through without breaking anything or screaming."
Though they miss the instant access to the museums of Manhattan, the theaters and the all-night deli down the block, the Kantors are enchanted by their new neighborhood. "We love the feel of Montague Street; it's like a little town," Mr. Kantor said. He also pointed out, "The commute for me is terrific, 'cause I work on Wall Street -- 15 minutes and one subway stop away."
Mrs. Kantor called Brooklyn Heights "neighborhoody" and "kid-centric." And there's "a beautiful little park right here on the Promenade," she said, where -- while Emma whoops it up on the see-saw and the slide -- her parents can take in the cathedral-like arches of the Brooklyn Bridge.
THE view was less appealing for Mr. Cabrera -- the South Bronx native now living across the Hudson -- when he was growing up. "Drugs being peddled on the corner, gunshots under the window every night," he said.
But his father, a six-day-a-week cab driver, and his mother, a seamstress, held it together. "It may have only been two bedrooms, and there were a few of us -- my mom and dad, two sisters, a younger brother, myself and Grandma," Mr. Cabrera said. "But you know what? Honest to God, I don't remember ever being hungry; I don't remember being disappointed for Christmas."
"I knew my life was going to be more than Walton Avenue," he said.
After graduating from Wesleyan University in Connecticut in 1989, Mr. Cabrera landed his stock trader's job and moved into the Rivergate on First Avenue. "I really did enjoy it," he said, "but when all was said and done, I had nothing to show for it."
Mr. Cabrera started considering buying, knowing that "for the same price for what I was going to get in Manhattan, besides 700 square feet of warm bedroom, I could have the place I have now in Jacob's Ferry." The development is in West New York, N.J., "which, I guess, is funny in itself," he said.
The town house, where Mr. Cabrera lives with his fiancee, Nora Montoya, is 1,300 square feet, has two bedrooms, a living room, a dining room, a rec room, a terrace and a garage -- for which he paid, in 1998, $285,000. The gated community also has two pools.
Ms. Montoya, 27, formerly an aspiring actress who says she now applies feng shui principles to people's living and work spaces, moved from Manhattan to the couple's New Jersey home a year ago. "I was bartending to support myself during acting, and I hated the vampire lifestyle, getting home at 4 or 5 in the morning," she said.
For Ms. Montoya, the greatest benefit of the move was just slowing down -- "not being so consumed with, 'Oh, I have to be here to do this, to do that.' Just taking a walk by the river, it's so grounding. You don't hear those city sounds -- the sirens, the drunk students at 3 a.m. In the city, what's natural becomes foreign."
The laugh is on Mr. Cabrera. "When I was a kid," he said, "I couldn't stop making jokes about people from New Jersey. Joe Piscopo, on 'Saturday Night Live,' used to do a skit with this high, goofy voice: 'Hi, I'm from Joisey!' He was a real doofus. I used to do the voice. Now I am that guy."

BYLINE:  By STEVE STRUNSKY

DATELINE: NEWARK 

 BODY:
The library at the Rutgers University Center for Law and Justice is a 56,236-square-foot citadel of hushed legal scholarship. 
 Opened to students, faculty members, the legal community and the rest of the public last January, the library has 488,100 books on fixed and space-saving rolling stacks, four computer labs providing access to anything not printed on paper, 8 study rooms, 12 seminar rooms, an alumni research room, a renowned criminal justice collection and moot courtrooms. 
 The library is situated within the 220,000-square-foot law and justice center, a gleaming postmodern building with a clock tower and vaulting rotunda, which also provides space for Rutgers law and criminal justice schools, and anchors a quadlike pedestrian mall that lends the Newark campus a collegiate feel.
"I study here every night," said 22-year-old Lauren Baime of Hoboken, a first-year law student. "I think it's really nice. As for the library's content, I can find anything I need for class." 
But if you think you have been improperly turned down for a job and you weave through the stacks to find Clark, Boardman, Callaghan's Employment Discrimination Coordinator, an updatable loose-leaf index in search of recent decisions that could support your discrimination suit, you might end up feeling overruled.
"Canceled 1995: Not Current," is the hand-scrawled message inside the coordinator's gray vinyl binder.
Cancellations of loose-leaf services, duplicate law journal subscriptions and various printed resources as well as a hold on some types of book acquisitions are the result of budget constraints on the library that, in view of the grand new building, seem incongruous at best. At worst, says the library director, stagnant financing for the past seven years now threatens to cut into the library's traditional mission to serve not only as a resource for the law school but also for lawyers, alumni, litigants arguing their own cases and those doing legal research.
"So we've had to do some very careful honing of what we receive," said the library's director, Prof. Carol Roehrenbeck. "We certainly get the critical important items, but a lot of the fringe items are no longer available, or they're available in an online format or you must use a database."
But, Professor Roehrenbeck was quick to add, "You also have to look at it in terms of what is the mission of the university, and we traditionally have been oriented to serving the community, and some of those online subscriptions are limited to enrolled students."
"We're lean and mean at the moment," she said. "But we can't get too much leaner."
While Rutgers spent $49 million in tax and tuition on the law and justice center, the law library's $627,236 operating budget for the current academic year -- not including salaries -- is actually $20,000 less than what it was in 1994-95.
Moreover, Ms. Roehrenbeck said she was told not to expect an increase for 2001-2002. With inflation averaging around 10 percent a year for printed materials, she said the library's real purchasing power has just about been cut in half since 1994-95.
"It's just obvious that if a budget is cut in half there are going to be constraints," said Prof. Charlie Harvey Woods, a librarian. "I don't know what the priorities are, I just know what trickles down."
Yet for his part, Andrew J. Rothman, the law school's assistant dean for faculty and students, said he had never received a complaint about the library from students since it opened a year ago. In addition, Professor Rothman said colleagues had traveled from all over northern New Jersey to use the library, attesting to its ample resources.
"I have had no complaints whatsoever about the library," Mr. Rothman said.
Students and faculty members are unlikely to suffer much moreinconvenience from cuts in printed material -- the library no longer receives multiple copies of the Harvard Law Review, for example it has subscriptions to Lexus and West Law, the premier legal databases.
But as Professor Roehrenbeck pointed out, the public typically does not .... And while she conceded that most printed materials not on hand can be obtained by inter-library loan, she said the process is inconvenient to borrowers and a demand on librarians' time. 
The cutbacks are especially significant, libarians say, since the Rutgers complexes in Newark and Camden are the premier law libraries available to the public in the state.
Moreover, the issue of financing is set against a backdrop of a debate in recent years over the university's spending priorities, particularly concerning whether too much emphasis has been placed on athletics. For instance, the annual salary for the women's head basketball coach, C. Vivian Stringer, is $400,000 -- or nearly two-thirds of the law library budget.
Of course, many Scarlet Knights fans contend that winning teams are more likely to attract lucrative television contracts and alumni donations than bulging library stacks.
The library's stagnant financing also seems inconsistent with the facility's increased use. For example, Professor Roehrenbeck said that a recent visual survey found that 850 to 950 people use the library every day, or three times the number of users before the library moved from its former location in the historic Firemen's Fund Building several blocks away.
Paul Grassi of Paterson, who was in the library last week researching conflict-of-interest cases to defend himself against code enforcement charges involving contracting work, said the service and availability of material could not have been better.
"If I come here and ask them for something, they're very helpful," Grassi said. "This library is not failing me."

HEADLINE: STRATEGIES; 
From Cash toStocks and Back, Based on the Calendar

BYLINE:  By MARK HULBERT; Mark Hulbert is editor of The Hulbert Financial Digest, a newsletter based in Annandale, Va. His column on investment strategies appears every other week. E-mail: strategy@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
I MUST confess that I was skeptical two decades ago, when I started monitoring a stock market timing model that looked too good to be true. According to that model, beating the market was as simple as being invested in stocks on the days when the market has historically gone up the most and remaining in cash at all other times.
 But apparently I am wrong. That model -- the Seasonality Trading System from the Institute for Econometric Research of Deerfield Beach, Fla. -- has outperformed every other timing model monitored by The Hulbert Financial Digest over two decades. 
 The model calls for investors to be invested in stocks only on distinct occasions each year -- around the turns of each month, as well as just before and after exchange holidays. On average, that would be a total of about 90 market trading days a year. The model is relatively low-risk, because it is safely invested in cash much of the time. In fact, its returns are about half as volatile as the stock market as a whole.
Despite its conservative bent, the model has produced long-term returns that are every bit as good as those of the market itself. An investor who used the model -- switching between hypothetical shares of the Wilshire 5000 index and 90-day Treasury bills -- would have made 16.1 percent, annualized, from the beginning of 1982 through January 2001. That compares to 16.0 percent for simply buying and holding the Wilshire 5000 stocks over this nearly 20-year period.
That record is impressive. Conservative investors would have been able to sidestep much of the market's risk without also having to forfeit profits. Aggressive investors would also have benefited from this timing model: by investing twice as much money as they would have otherwise, for example, they would have doubled the market's return while incurring no greater risk.
But no one should choose a strategy on the basis of its track record alone. That is because past success, without some plausible explanation, may be a result of luck alone. 
Fortunately, in this case, there is an explanation. According to research conducted by Prof. Donald B. Keim of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, there are distinct calendar patterns to how stocks trade relative to their bid-asked spreads. It turns out that at various points during the year -- at the end of December, for example, or just before exchange holidays -- stocks typically trade near their bid prices. But immediately after those periods, they trade closer to their asked prices. To the extent of its bid-asked spread, then, the average stock rises during such periods.
Professor Keim's findings imply that there is no way to exploit these seasonal patterns by investing directly in individual stocks, because the bid-asked spreads would eliminate the potential gains. But that is not the case when you buy stocks indirectly, through no-load mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, whose net asset values are calculated on the basis of their component stocks' last trades. By investing in them during these seasonal periods, you can, in effect, buy stocks at or near their bid prices and sell them near their asked prices.
And you thought only market-makers could do that!
Why should there be seasonal patterns for how stocks trade relative to their spreads? Many different explanations have been suggested. One is that retirement plan contributions typically hit the market at the beginning of each month. Another factor is tax-loss selling that reaches a crescendo at year-end. A third is short-term traders' propensity, just before exchange holidays, to cover, or buy back, the stocks they are short.
There is a downside to investing according to seasonal patterns: it means frequent switching into and out of the market. Over the last two decades, in fact, the Seasonality Trading System has recommended an average of 16 such round trips a year. So do not even consider following the strategy in a taxable account or with any investment that involves high transaction costs.

HEADLINE: ON THE CONTRARY; 
Nike inIndonesia, Through a Different Lens

BYLINE:  By DANIEL AKST; Daniel Akst's column tilts at conventional business wisdom and appears the first Sunday of each month. E-mail: culmoney@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
AROUND our house, there were two big stories in the footwear business recently: Critics of Nike again walked all over the company because of conditions in Indonesian factories. And my son got new sneakers for $7.
 Is there a connection between the two events? You bet. They both involve third-world workers desperate to better themselves. The difference is that, by buying the $7 sneakers, we actually did some good. 
 The latest flak directed at Nike, much beset by critics of its practices in third-world factories, comes in a report from the nonprofit Global Alliance for Workers and Communities, of which a penitent Nike is a founding member. The alliance said it uncovered a string of problems in a survey of 4,450 workers at nine Indonesian factories. 
What were those problems? Well, to start, nearly 8 percent of workers reported receiving unwanted sexual comments and nearly 2.5 percent said they had received unwanted sexual touching on the job.
These numbers are astounding -- astoundingly low. Last year, a Wall Street Journal/NBC poll found that 31 percent of American women had experienced workplace harassment. In the American military, according to a government survey for 1995, the figure was 55 percent. (It is possible, of course, that because of cultural differences or fear of retaliation, some Indonesian women interviewed by Global Alliance did not disclose possible harassment.)
Another finding in the Global Alliance survey was that 55 percent of the Nike contract workers in Indonesia were happy with company medical clinics, while 45 percent were unhappy. Yet few American factories have company health clinics, and 42 million Americans lack health insurance. 
The report also found that 30 percent of the Indonesian workers had been victims of verbal abuse, like swearing or yelling. Yet the report found that 73 percent of the workers were satisfied with work relationships with their direct supervisors, and 68 percent with factory management.
Some workers also complained that while overtime was voluntary, they felt pressure to take it. This at least differs from my past experience in the American newspaper industry, where overtime at smaller publications was often compulsory and sometimes uncompensated despite labor laws. The only widespread complaint, raised by 90 percent of the Indonesian workers surveyed, was that it was hard to get sick time off. Otherwise, the Indonesian factories appear to be models of their kind, providing incomes that are above minimum wage to workers who would be poorer in their absence.
Still, Maria Eitel, a Nike vice president and senior adviser for corporate responsibility, said the report's findings were disturbing. She said a remediation plan had begun to address the problems. 
Evidently, Nike has had to embrace the accusations of its accusers instead of boasting that, by contracting with factories employing more than a half-million workers in 55 countries, the company is running one of the world's most extensive international development programs. By hiring many women (83 percent of the workers in the Indonesian factories) Nike is giving them the economic power to help raise their often-lowly social status. 
The critics may score extra benefits for some workers, but by hectoring Nike, they weaken its brand and raise its cost of doing business. Well-meaning customers, upset by stories of sweatshops and happy to save money, may skip the Nikes and buy off brands. Of course, these knock-offs were probably made under worse conditions. 
Imagine for a minute that there were no big-name companies manufacturing in third-world countries. Everyone would buy the kind of no-name sneakers that we just did -- made in Guatemala under God-knows-what circumstances -- and there would be no one to try to embarrass except me, which will never work. Like most people, I want cheap sneakers. And I know that the Guatemalans need the money; otherwise, they wouldn't take these jobs. 
If companies like Nike are the devil that we know, the off-brand devil that we don't is probably worse. The day may come when Americans display their concern for third-world workers by making sure their Nike "swoosh" is showing. Then the logo won't be just ubiquitous; it will also be P.C.

UNEMPLOYMENT RATE

BYLINE:  By George James

 BODY:
 While the nation's unemployment rate continues to climb, New Jersey's continues to fall. The state's jobless rate in January fell 0.2 percentage points to 3.6 percent, its lowest monthly rate since March 1970, according to figures released last week by the New Jersey Department of Labor. 
The figures, however, did not reflect recent corporate layoffs, such as those by Lucent Technologies, based in Murray Hill, which is letting go 10,000 workers -- 1,500 of them in New Jersey. Nonetheless, in a week when the economic news nationally was mostly bad, labor analysts were cheered by the fact the state's unemployment rate for the 13th consecutive month had fallen below the national rate, which was 4.2 percent in January.

In Crowded Areas, a Parking Lot Can Look Like Paradise

BYLINE:  By DENNY LEE

 BODY:
The real estate boom may have leveled off, but it has eaten up vacant lots used for parking, and their loss may be felt for years. At the same time, some residents say lots once viewed as eyesores provide relief in a crowded city.
 During the economic upswing, scores of parking lots from TriBeCa to Harlem were snatched by developers seeking to build residential and commercial buildings. 
 "As a result of their rising value and demand, as well as the availability of financing, sites that were not viable for development became viable," said Joseph B. Rose, chairman of the City Planning Commission.
In SoHo, 10 of 17 remaining parking lots are being developed for new buildings, said Sean Sweeney, director of the SoHo Alliance, a community group.
New zoning rules adopted by the city have also encouraged more development. In the flower district along the Avenue of the Americas, which was rezoned in 1995 to allow for residential use, nearly 34,000 square feet of parking lot space have disappeared and an additional 59,000 square feet are being negotiated.
But in neighborhoods with little open air, some residents say they prefer parked cars to new buildings.
"Parking lots aren't seen as an eyesore anymore, but a relief," Mr. Sweeney said. "They provide sunlight and breathing room. We would rather see ugly hydraulic lifts for stacked cars than see a new building."
For car owners, this trend means higher prices and fewer vacancies. Nearly 900 parking lots are licensed by the city, but that number is expected to decline as developers complete real estate deals. And waiting lists of up to two years for an indoor spot are becoming more common, said Elliot Brownstein, president of Mutual Parking, which operates 60 garages in Manhattan. 
Mr. Rose of the Planning Commission said his department might revise 1982 rules aimed at reducing traffic by limiting the number of parking spaces.
"We are consciously in the process of changing the regulations to allow more off-street parking," he said. DENNY LEE

HEADLINE: INVESTING; 
How to Hedge Bets, Two by Two

BYLINE:  By JOANNE LEGOMSKY 

 BODY:
IT'S time to bring in the stock pickers.
 With grand strategies and firm convictions becoming casualties of the stalled, often rocky stock market, some people on Wall Street are reviving a strategy intended to capitalize on such difficult conditions. The approach, called pair trading, is essentially an exercise in extreme stock-picking that seeks to make an investor indifferent to the which way the overall market goes -- or whether it moves at all. 
 A pair trade means buying a stock that is thought to be undervalued while selling short an equal dollar amount of a similar or related stock, typically of a competitor, that appears overvalued. 
The short position, which is a wager that the stock price will decline, reduces risk by protecting against a market downturn. Offsetting it with the stock that is owned -- the long side of the equation -- makes an investor neutral to the market, and, depending on the picks, more or less impervious to the vicissitudes of a particular industry. What's left are bets on individual stocks. 
If the stock picks are squarely on the mark, an investor can make money on both the long and short sides, and the direction of the the overall market does not matter.
"It's actually an all-weather strategy, but it makes more sense in a sideways market," said Christopher J. Wolfe, equity strategist for private clients at J. P. Morgan Chase. "It works well with companies with similar products or end markets whose stocks are closely correlated, but where there is a valuation disparity." 
But the strategy can be used in gyrating markets, too.
"Pair trades also are a way to play volatility," Mr. Wolfe said. That is because any development that strengthens the competitive position of one of the companies versus the other, like a new product, will have a greater impact on the respective stock prices in a volatile market.
"The correlations become less stable," he said.
If you are unswervingly bullish or bearish, of course, you probably would be better off simply owning stocks or shorting them, without any hedge. "You don't hear much about pair trades in bull or bear markets," said Clark B. Winter Jr., chief investment strategist for Citigroup's private banking division.
But Mr. Winter said he thought the current investment climate made this strategy attractive for the bank's clients. He said Citigroup looked for hedge fund managers "with the ability to identify pair trades as part of their ongoing strategy."
Catherine Jackson, director of research at LJH Global Investments, a firm in Naples, Fla., that helps institutions and wealthy individuals assemble hedge fund portfolios, said pair trading was gaining appeal with managers investing in Europe.
"Everybody's using the strategy now," Ms. Jackson said. "What else can you do in a trendless market?" 
To sell a stock short, an investor sells borrowed shares and hopes that the price drops so he can eventually return them at lower cost, pocketing the difference. If it rises, the investor loses money, a theoretically unlimited amount. 
So should an investor buy, say, General Motors and sell short Ford Motor, which has a higher price-to-earnings ratio? Experts suggest caution in pair trading.
Like any form of active management, it has risks, because the investor is still picking stocks rather than relying on a broader, indexed approach that will provide average market returns. In fact, pair trades can increase risk, as well as reduce it. If you select the wrong stocks, you can lose money on both sides of the transaction. 
"It requires intensive research," said John Moon, manager of $1 billion in emerging-markets hedge funds at Oak Tree Capital. "You need to identify price anomalies plus make a call on the fundamentals." 
In his view, pair trades work best in volatile industries, like technology and telecommunications, because there is more opportunity to take advantage of stock price divergences. 
Mr. Moon is now shorting the stocks of several American manufacturers that work on contracts, because of high valuations and vulnerability to a prolonged economic slump, though he would not disclose any company names. He is long the shares of certain Asian companies in the same industry, like Elec & Eltek, which he considers more reasonably valued and likely to rise more when the sector improves. 
Robert Jain, head of global portfolio and program trading at Credit Suisse First Boston, regularly uses pair trades on behalf of the firm's clients. He said he thought the strategy's appeal was growing. "People are realizing that they can't rely on the market's continuing to go up," he said. 
But Mr. Jain usually recommends that clients buy a stock and short a related exchange-traded fund, a mutual-fund-like product that trades like a stock. Or, they may buy the E.T.F. and short the stock. "Buying one stock and shorting another doesn't reduce your risk that much," he said. "You're still assuming a lot of company-specific risk."
He is now recommending a pair trade that involves buying either the El Paso Corporation or Anadarko Petroleum, energy companies that carry the firm's top rating, and selling short either the iShares Dow Jones U.S. Energy Sector Index fund or the Energy Select Sector SPDR, a basket of energy stocks traded on the American Stock Exchange that has similar investment characteristics but is more actively traded. 
Mr. Jain also recommends buying either of two health care stocks, Johnson & Johnson or Pharmacia, and shorting the iShares Dow Jones U.S. Healthcare Sector Index fund. 
Using exchange-traded funds has an advantage beyond greater diversification. Unlike stocks, they are not subject to the downtick rule, which prohibits shorting a stock at a lower price than the preceding sale to prevent negative sentiment from snowballing.
"If you're trying to put on a trade of two stocks, there's a risk that you can execute one side and not another, because of the short-sale rule," Mr. Jain said. 
AT J. P. Morgan Chase, Mr. Wolfe is recommending several stock-for-stock pair trades to the firm's private clients. 
He advises investors to buy shares of Pfizer, the pharmaceutical company, and short the shares of its rival, Merck. He said that despite comparable valuations, Pfizer had fewer major drugs about to lose patent protection.
He continues to like a trade pairing a long position in Sun Microsystems with a short position in EMC. The companies have similar markets in data storage, Mr. Wolfe said, but he added that EMC was more vulnerable to weakness in this sector because of its still-high price-to-earnings multiple.
But Mr. Wolfe added this caution about pair trading: "This is a trading strategy, not an investing strategy," he said. "You should view it as a side bet."

HEADLINE: At a Horse Show, Entitlement Is in the Air 

BYLINE:  By GUY TREBAY 

DATELINE: WELLINGTON, Fla. 

 BODY:
NO sooner had the plane hit the tarmac at West Palm Beach than a passenger fired up his cell phone and started giving instructions to his groom. "If you go downstairs and look behind the door in my bedroom, my sticks are hanging on the door," the man said, in the adenoidal drawl one imagines as the speaking voice of characters in William Hamilton cartoons. 
 The sticks he was referring to were polo mallets. His knee pads, as fellow Delta Air Lines passengers soon learned, were in the closet by the stairs, along with his breeches and his boots. The man's helmet was in the hall closet in a monogrammed blue bag. 
 "It'll be terrific if you can just meet me at the club, just terrific, and that way I'll be able to get in an extra chukker," said the man, referring to the seven-minute periods that are polo's version of innings. Then he added, not remotely sotto voce: "Oh, and I've got a $100,000 check you can deposit for me on your way home." 
It is like that in Palm Beach County, where -- although the median per capita income is near the United States average -- there are houses the size of suburban banks, luxury cars built on the scale of public conveyances and, in general, a human-to-Gulfstream V jet ratio more impressive than any place outside Qatar. The economic downturn that has many middle-class people resetting their retirement dates seems to have made few inroads in these parts. One place where this can be observed most plainly is at the Palm Beach Polo Equestrian Club in this town 14 miles inland from the ocean.
It's here that polo teams fielded by the super-rich spend the winter at play. Here, too, is the site of an annual winter equestrian festival that represents not only the top-level equestrians in the country, but what may be the greatest seasonal migration of that tiny herd substantially in charge of controlling America's wealth. 
What began a little more than a decade ago as a place for snowbirds to campaign their sport horses during the bitter East Coast winters has now become the premier event on the American show jumping circuit. Beginning in January, the emerald lawns of the Palm Beach Polo Equestrian Club are transformed into the Cosequin Winter Equestrian Festival, a vast, luxurious tent camp accommodating a 10-week occupation by what Gore Vidal once characterized as America's stealth rulers, and Lewis Lapham has more delicately termed "the equestrian class."
Some of their names are the boldface kind: Kelly Klein, Patty Davis Raynes, Sloan Lindemann Barnett, Alison Firestone, Georgina Bloomberg, Cornelia Guest. Many are not. Equally, there are those here who are obscure outside the radius of a show ring and, inside one, virtual gods. They include the former Olympians Joe Fargis and Conrad Homfeld, the current Olympic team member Laura Kraut and national circuit champions like Margie Goldstein Engle. 
All of them convene each winter on what once was farmland abutting the Everglades. Here, in a suburb of equestrian-themed estates is set a multi-ring showgrounds, a stadium-size Grand Prix arena, and row upon row of green-striped tents erected to stable horseflesh valued conservatively in the scores of millions. Accompanying the approximately 6,500 animals that arrived this particular winter was an army of the wealthy: new money, dot-com money, Wall Street money and a significant number of people whose raw fortunes have been passed through the purifying filter of time. 
It is probably these types whom Warren E. Buffett, the Omaha investor, was referring to when he recently urged Congress not to repeal the estate tax. Without the tax, Mr. Buffett warned, "you pass down the ability to command the resources of the nation based on heredity rather than merit." Sportsmen are not the only ones to understand the importance of bloodlines to success. It's apparent to anyone visiting the Cosequin Winter Equestrian Festival just what Mr. Buffett means.
"The horse business is the biggest business in America," C. Z. Guest, the socialite and garden writer, observed last weekend, as she made her way to her family's private box overlooking the Grand Prix arena at the showgrounds. And it may be surprising to learn that more than seven million Americans are involved with horses, either as owners, service providers, employees or volunteers. A survey conducted by the Barents Group of Washington, D.C., concluded that the total impact of the industry on the United States' economy was $112.1 billion. A separate study by a private group tidily collapsed this finding to a more useful comparison of haves and have nots: "The ratio of horse owners whose annual income exceeds $100,000 to nonhorse owners who earn more than $100,000 per year: 4 to 1."
Wearing beige silk shorts and a white cotton cap stitched with the logo of the Myopia Hunt Club, Mrs. Guest leaned over a rail and waved toward a training arena where riders were conducting their mounts over four-foot "schooling" fences. "There's an awful lot of money floating around these days," she said. "These are $1 million and $2 million horses. Show jumping has gotten more expensive than horse racing, and I know because I've done both." Adjusting her visor, Mrs. Guest added, "Anyone who thinks there's a depression should come here."
Anyone who thinks there's a depression would probably be too spooked even to enter the showgrounds, where the aura of wealth is so palpable the whole place resembles the gentrified scenarios conjured in Ralph Lauren ads. It is not just a matter of obviously expensive horseflesh (horses at Wellington cost on average $50,000, although at the higher levels the threshold rises to $250,000 and above). Neither is it the $300 German riding breeches or $750 bespoke Der-Dau boots or $4,500 Hermes flat saddles or $1,400 alligator-banded Charles Pinnell chaps.
It is not the fact that, as one rider put it, "You can't even be standing here with one horse for under $10,000 a week." It is not that some owners ship their horses to Florida in private jets; or that others, like the Atlanta insurance heiress Mary B. Schwab, arrive with as many as 15 mounts. It is not even the fact that bicolor Rolex Oyster Perpetual watches seem to be the timepiece of choice -- for 12-year-olds. 
Rather, it is the palpable air of remove, an atmosphere of entitlement so casually assumed that it makes the effetely languid models in those Ralph Lauren ads seem like jokes or cartoons. Once you have turned off Polo Club Road and onto the showgrounds, you would be hard-pressed to believe that a world exists of bank overdrafts, credit card debt or mortgage shortfalls, never mind that only 30 miles down the road, people are actually setting cane field fires and then waiting for wild rabbits to flee the flames in order to club them for food. 
Wellington is not the place for those realities. It is, instead, where you will find the originals for all the bogus patricians central not only to Mr. Lauren's vision, but to that of so many designers, including Michael Kors. In fact, Mr. Kors's fall 2001 collection was entirely built around an equestrian theme, the models sent out in clothes inspired not so much by the clothes riders wear as garments for their mounts. Empire waist dresses were belted with the same type of surcingle belts used on horse "coolers." Coats were made in blanket wool. And why not copy horses when -- at Wellington, at least -- they're typically turned out as expensively and with as much chic as a Park Avenue socialite. 
"The horses have a dozen different blankets and sheets and rain blankets and turnout blankets," said Mark Badgley, half of the evening-wear design team of Badgley Mischka, who commutes each weekend to Wellington to ride one of his three hunters. "Everything is done in the barn's colors," he said. "And then the tack trunks have to match."
The stable blocks, too, are arranged in theme colors, with homey displays out front, each decorated with monogrammed felt banners. There are mounting blocks and saddle racks, hunting prints, antique jockey hitching posts, old wicker and cast iron chairs. "There's so much that goes along with the riding," Mr. Badgley said. Many of the big stables plant miniature gardens outside their tents for the season: dwarf palms, begonias, camellias arrayed in lush miniature lawns. "We were going to do a garden; we always have," explained Cornelia Guest, who long ago jettisoned her 1970's Deb of the Decade tag to pursue a career on the show jumping circuit. "But there's the drought," she added, referring to Florida's worst dry season in 100 years.
Ms. Guest has six horses at Wellington, which she rides in amateur owner jumper classes on courses with motocross turns, spooky angles and fences considerably taller than, say, Gary Coleman. "Cornelia has no fear, she'll jump a school bus," said Mr. Badgley. "She's also a prime example of someone who does this really seriously full time."
She is not alone in that. "Sure, it's a circus and a zoo, and with so many horses and riders and such a high level of money it's unreal," said Katie Monahan Prudent, a United States Equestrian Team and World Cup veteran. No one complains, Ms. Prudent added, because, "for every person who's down here, there's 600 people waiting behind them for a spot." 
For the athletes, added George Morris, the chef d'equipe of the U.S.E.T.'s show jumping team, "Wellington has become the toughest and the best" horse show in the country, even supplanting such traditional fixtures of the winter circuit as the National Horse Show in New York. "The indoor circuit has lost its luster because of this," said Mr. Morris, who has trained generations of riders at his New Jersey-based Hunterdon Farm. "Even the top, top, top riders from Europe, when they come here, don't just come along and win," said Mr. Morris. "The best course builders are here, the best riders, the best horses."
People say that show jumping "is elitist," Ms. Guest said. People would be correct. Yet, she added, "the sport is coming away from that image." Perhaps it is. "That show jumping is an expensive sport is not a misconception for a layman to have," said Mary B. Schwab, whose string of thoroughbreds and crossbreds are managed and ridden by Mr. Fargis, the Olympic medalist. Surveying the eight rings in which riders of all ages were trotting and cantering on a staggering array of immaculate horseflesh, Ms. Schwab added: "It's not entirely just pros and people who ride seven days a week who come down here. There are actually riders here who do other things. They have a life. They work at jobs." 
The accuracy of her statement must be taken on faith.

BYLINE:  By ANDREW FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
DURING the week, while other people are at work, Christa Sidman, a 32-year-old casualty of dot-com fallout, answers the phone in her apartment on East 22nd Street.
 "I was laid off the week after Thanksgiving," she said during one recent call. "I still haven't found a job." Could she meet sometime to talk about it? "I am flexibility itself," she answered. 
 So, the next day, sitting in a sunny coffee shop, Ms. Sidman drained a cup and recalled her life in a far grander place, the white granite and brick 22-story building in Lower Manhattan where she used to work. 
Two Scottish brothers, George and William Audsley, completed the structure in 1898 in an eclectic style that the architects called Hellenic Renaissance. During its life the building, 11 Broadway, has sheltered banks, law firms, insurers, utilities, engineering outfits, maritime ventures and financial concerns. This is the story of the spectacular rise and fall of some of its most recent residents: more than 60 Internet and high-tech companies, and the people, like Ms. Sidman, who worked for them. 
Ms. Sidman's stay at 11 Broadway was just three and a half months. She worked in a dazzling office on the 17th floor for a dot-com called Stockback. The company projected its name on the entrance wall in white light and, every other week, its executives would don chef's hats and serve the employees a buffet of sausage and eggs. Her job, as a copywriter, was to explain the exhilaration of shopping online and getting a rebate, either in cash or in stock. She still remembers her best line, written for a campaign aimed at fraternities and sororities: "There's a time when another bake sale isn't going to do the trick." 
"You could sit and brainstorm whole new worlds into being," said Ms. Sidman, an Ohio native with a literature degree from Earlham College in Richmond, Ind. "They paid me more than I've ever been paid before to do what I love. They said they valued writers. I believed them. I still believe they meant what they said."
Ms. Sidman remembers gazing out the wide windows of 11 Broadway, watching the orange sunlight shining off the East River and the Statue of Liberty. She also remembers the Wednesday after Thanksgiving, the day she was fired, when she zipped over to the company meeting early to claim one of the cozy, deep leather couches. Soon, one of the owners stood up.
"Well," he said, "you know how the market's doing."
If your name began with A-L you had to get in one line, M-Z in another. The executives handed out envelopes containing a sheet of paper with a conference room and a time written in script. Workers showed up at their appointed time and, by day's end, 37 workers would have jobs and 29 would not.
Ms. Sidman's meeting was at 9:30 a.m. She would not be coming back. She barely heard the phrases: "nothing to do with performance," "appease our investors." They gave her a week of severance pay. She sat with a friend, the only other copywriter, and watched people file in and out of the conference rooms, then start to pack or to cry. At 11:30, her friend lost her job. They shared a cab uptown. 
"Don't tell me after three and a half months I have to look for another job," she remembers thinking that day. "Don't tell me. It was so fun to work here."
Although New York's economy is healthy, Ms. Sidman is clearly not alone among the young and the wretched in the Internet world these days. Still, as dry statistics pour into papers about dot-com layoffs -- more than 5,000 in the city in the last six months -- it is difficult to realize that the dot-com decline happens in real places. And one of those places is 11 Broadway.
The building -- on a walk north from the Battery, it's the second one on the west side of the street -- has witnessed other disasters. The White Star Line, owner of the Titanic, had its headquarters there, and when the ship sank in 1912 crowds of men in black hats thronged the entrances, shouting for news of their loved ones. In the mid-80's, the disgraced stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky had 9,500 square feet of office space overlooking the harbor.
Something always seemed off about the building, which is a designated landmark and is officially known as 5-11 Broadway. It was built on slanted ground and even had an oddball floor that was four and a half feet high from floor to ceiling, like the one in the film "Being John Malkovich." 
But money has no memory. In the mid-90's, with its cheap rents and funky, historic character, 11 Broadway seemed like a good place to start a business.

The Virtual Wagon Trains Begin to Arrive
Anthony Spina, a former newspaper truck driver, was the first Internet entrepreneur to arrive. It was May 1995, and he had recently started an Internet service provider, Thorn Communications. A real estate agent showed him 11 Broadway, whose owner, then and now, is a group called Bowling Green Associates.
The plywood walls in the elevator and the cheap pink wallpaper on the marble columns did not make the place look attractive. Nor was it brimming with tenants. "It was 10 percent full, if you count those who weren't paying rent," said Robert Shenker, the landlord's lawyer. But for $12 a square foot plus electric, Mr. Spina moved in.
"All of downtown was kind of a ghost town," said Mr. Spina, 42. "There was no incentive but good cheap space."
Mr. Spina quickly started exploring 11 Broadway, and he found incredible things. The building was like a streambed, with each floor, like a layer of sedimentary rock, trapping a different era. There were the old vaults of the steamship captains in the basement; an abandoned, dusty set of bookshelves, circa 1910; a newspaper lodged in a wall that announced the Russians had launched their first moon rocket, and a mysterious out-of-order shower on the top floor, which has a huge window built into the wall that would make the shower's users feel as if they were floating in air. 
Soon, Mr. Spina had neighbors. Another company, Web Factory, moved onto the third floor and started giving parties on the 16th, where fine harbor views made these pioneers feel as if they owned the world. They had art shows there, and disc jockeys. They roped off some areas so guests wouldn't fall through the holes in the floor.
"It was the wild, wild West," said Kim Hill, who was a partner at Web Factory, now defunct. He is now a vice president at Click Radio, an online radio station. "There was a sense of cash in the air."
More dot-coms arrived, claiming more and more of the building. Many came to 11 Broadway under the Plug 'n' Go program run by the Downtown Alliance, the local business improvement district. The deal: if landlords held down rents to around $15 a square foot, the BID marketed their properties free.
The dot-coms had esprit. They knocked off early on Fridays and played massive games of Quake, the popular computer game, at the eighth-floor offices of a company called Random Walk Computing. 
"There were just six nerds playing then; including me, seven nerds," said Edmund Bogen, who runs Bogen PR, a public relations company that worked with dot-coms and held informal bagel breakfasts for the dot-com workers. "Soon it went to 50 nerds."
Paul Guzyk, who ran an Internet service provider called Infohouse, started an e-mail list at 11 Broadway. Someone else set up a video camera feeding into a Macintosh in an empty office and called it LibertyCam. All day it gazed at the Statue of Liberty, like a cyberimmigrant perpetually arriving to live the American dream.
"The feeling was much newer then," Mr. Bogen said.

Halcyon Days Of Bagels and Foosball
By early last year, 11 Broadway had soared from 10 percent occupancy to 98 percent, and rents had shot up from $15 to $40 a square foot. The dot-coms had come marching in: Moving.com, Stockback, NetGrocer.com, Commissioner.com. WealthHound.com, an investing site calling itself the "portal to prosperity," took prestige space on the top floors.
Some grew fast. In spring 1997, Mail.com, which sets up e-mail systems for businesses, moved 20 people into a corner of the sixth floor. After going public in June 1999, the company spread to the whole sixth floor, then part of the ninth, then most of the second and parts of the third and fourth. By then it had almost 300 employees. Other companies arrived with such haste that the landlords didn't have enough time to add them to the floor directories. The startups glued and taped their names up instead.
"We used to laugh," said Michael Gersh, one of four fraternity brothers from Carnegie-Mellon University who ran a sports fantasy Web site called Commissioner.com. "Every third one would be like Cyberintertechnology Inc." 
Then there were the million-dollar redesigns. Tempest Software, an online security firm, converted the 16th floor into a minimalist space station, with clean lines, 17-foot ceilings and chrome spotlights. The cubicles were fashioned from a special white surface that could be written on, making the whole office a literal drawing board. 
Fun was embraced. "We got a Foosball table and at one point in time, it was myself, the vice president of engineering, the vice president of professional services and the president, playing a game of Foosball," said Roland Cozzolino, a Tempest executive. "I looked around and said, 'You realize how much money is being spent on us playing Foosball right now?' " 
For a time, it didn't matter. In December 1999, Paul Guzyk sold Infohouse for $3 million in cash and stock. That same month, Mr. Gersh and his fraternity brothers sold their company for $31 million. The night of the sale, they rented a skybox at ESPN Zone to see a football game and in their glee and civic gratitude sent some Dom Perignon to Mayor Giuliani, who was sitting nearby.
Matt Fortnow, one of the fraternity brothers, bought a bumblebee-colored Harley-Davidson for $21,000. All four had to work at Commissioner.com for a year after the sale, but since then Mr. Fortnow hasn't worked. He wrote a screenplay about a baseball team during the Depression, applied to be a Big Brother, is installing a new kitchen in his one-bedroom co-op on the Upper East Side and goes out almost every night.
When asked if he would ever need to work again, Mr. Fortnow said, "No."
Perhaps nothing captures those halcyon times better than the day in June 1999 that Mail.com went public.
When the Nasdaq exchange opened, Lon Otremba, the chief operating officer, and other executives were there. They cheered as the price soared from its opening at $8. Back at the office, with the stock still rising, the employees had a catered lunch and their shouting was heard buildingwide. Then they stormed out the bronze doors of 11 Broadway, charged up to the bull sculpture in Bowling Green and rubbed its nose for luck. They snapped pictures of themselves, to remember the day forever.
Company executives had urged everyone to remember that going public was a beginning, not an ending, but the excitement was great. And for a while, justified: by December 1999, six months after Mail.com went public, the stock hit $29 and the young founders were worth $26 million.

The Year the Heroes Fell to Earth
From April to December of last year, the dream dimmed.
Mail.com, the best-known publicly traded company there, felt it first. Overnight, the office became like some bizarre day-trading hell, where nervous employees checked the stock price every five minutes.
"When the stock price went down 20 percent in three days we knew something was happening," Mr. Otremba said. "It felt awful. The week before you were a hero."
The decline hit Internet service providers like Infohouse, then owned by Network Plus, which saw a couple of clients fail to pay bills. It hit Internet publicity firms like Bogen PR and Breakfast Network Productions, another Bogen venture, which laid off six people in November. It hit dot-com consultants like Hudson Williams, which laid off two people this January and widened its clientele to include traditional businesses.
"It hurt," Mr. Bogen said. "It hurt really, really badly. It was a massive crash."
Overnight, the reversal transformed futuristic offices of promise into dark caverns of empty desks. People grimly joked about stealing a part of the bull's anatomy to stave off disaster. Eventually, in one way or another, everyone was affected.
Belts were tightened. Workers switched from car services to yellow cabs and stopped the office massages. There were fewer coolers full of free soda, fewer spreads of food at fewer parties.
"We all hoped we were going to be rich and we'd never have to work again," said Dana Zerlin, who still works at Hudson Williams. "Now a lot of people are going to corporate companies."
The stock of Mail.com fell below 75 cents. It now trades in the $1 range. The company also cut its staff, slashing 15 percent on Oct. 30, making it a very creepy Halloween Eve. 
Dan Duffany was one of those Halloween casualties, getting one month's notice and three months of severance pay, he said.
"I've been discovering the joys of daytime TV and Pokemon," Mr. Duffany said. He finally landed a job two weeks ago with a Yonkers company that makes stage sets. 
"I put the brakes on all my spending immediately," Mr. Duffany said. "Going out to dinner frequently stopped. The DVD's stopped. I stopped shopping at Balducci's and went back to the Food Emporium." During the December holidays, he added, "I was not as generous as I'd like to have been. I felt ashamed at first. I like to treat my nieces and nephews well, and I was like, 'Gee, I really have to cheap out this year.' "
Mr. Otremba himself left Mail.com in November to head another dot-com. But, he remembers, "The stress level rose at home" as the troubles persisted. 
"My wife was looking at the financial pages," he said. "I couldn't sell any shares. Most paper wealth was just that."
"I'm proud of the work I did," Mr. Otremba said. "It's somewhat bittersweet. I'm still a sizable stockholder, so I'm cheering them from the stands."

Web Sites of Yore: You Can't Go Home Again
What about Christa Sidman? 
On most mornings, she wakes up, eats a blueberry muffin, works on her resume and searches for a job in a market glutted with dot-com people. Sometimes she just can't deal with it and strolls through the East Village and window-shops. At times, she nostalgically logs onto the Stockback site. 
She can't afford to shoot pool at Fat Cat Billiards in the West Village anymore, but she does pull out old Duran Duran and Fleetwood Mac records from high school, and listens to them with her cat, Uma.
"Not having a job is not like a vacation," Ms. Sidman said. "You don't feel free. You're either actively looking, or you feel like you should look. One thing I did not do is cancel my Club Med vacation in March. It's costing a thousand bucks."
When she talks about that trip to Mexico, with dance lessons and horseback riding on the beach, her spirits seem to lift.
At 11 Broadway life goes on, but far less ebulliently. Holly Lehr, a spokeswoman for Mail.com, said it plans to move to New Jersey. And in mid-February, the venture announced it would drop its dot-com label and change its name to EasyLink Services. 
Dot-coms are going mainstream in other ways. Mike Atwood, the new chief executive of Tempest Software, arrived at its offices the other day carrying a resume that includes a stint at Electronic Data Systems, the company founded by Ross Perot that now employs 125,000.
"You have to bring in people of influence and power," said Mr. Cozzolino, the Tempest executive. "It becomes more like a regular day-to-day company." 
Matt Fortnow rode his Harley away from 11 Broadway for the last time on New Year's Eve. His frat brothers stayed on, but soon they will move to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., to the headquarters of SportsLine.com, the new owner of Commissioner.com.
As old companies leave, new ones arrive, with 11 Broadway still essentially full, Mr. Shenker said. Loquesea, a Web site based in Caracas, Venezuela, is now building an office with mosaic tiles and dark-stained cherry wood on the 18th and 19th floors.
On a recent afternoon, Mr. Guzyk returned to 11 Broadway from the West Side offices of Network Plus, the new owner of Infohouse. He took the elevator to the 11th floor and unlocked the tiny room where Infohouse began. A single blue data cabinet sat in the once busy room, coldly whooshing. Wires lay strewn across the floor.
"At one point in time our entire operation was in this room," Mr. Guzyk said, waving his arm over the rubble, which the company will soon abandon altogether. "We had seven people in here and our equipment. It looked like this when we got here and we cleaned it up. Now it looks like this again."
If 11 Broadway had a voice, it would be that of Prashant, the 24-year-old with mocking eyes who runs the lobby newsstand, where, he says, business has slowed.
"Every day companies come and companies go," he said on a recent afternoon. "What do I care? I never ask them about their business. They tell me that it's their last day, that they have to find a job. What do I care? What's going to happen if I do?"
In case you lost track of time, it all took less than six years.

The $4 Movie Goes the Way of the 5 cents Phone Call

BYLINE:  By DENNY LEE

 BODY:
Cineplex Odeon Encore Worldwide, long known to moviegoers as the $3 theater on West 50th Street, closed its doors two weeks ago, just as ticket prices citywide reached a record high.
 Since 1994 the theater, between Eighth and Ninth Avenues, had booked second-run films as well as first-run releases that had already played elsewhere. Its final schedule included movies like "Charlie's Angels," which was released in November and can still be seen at about 70 theaters around the nation. 
 The low prices drew crowds from across the city. After holding prices steady at $3 for several years, the theater recently raised admission to $4. But that amount was still far less than the city's average ticket, which cost $8.50 last summer.
"I'm devastated," said Maura Keaney, who lives in Flatbush, Brooklyn, and works as an aide to City Councilwoman Christine Quinn.
"I'm from Florida, where there are still dollar theaters everywhere," Ms. Keane said. "I thought $4 was still a rip-off, but now I'm quite upset." 
Officials at Loews Cineplex Entertainment, which ran the theater, said the closing had stemmed from the company's recent filing for bankruptcy as part of a deal to be acquired by an investment group.
"The economics just don't work at that price point," said Mindy Tucker, a Loews spokeswoman. "It had suffered from competition from newer theaters like the AMC Empire Theater nearby."
But a week after closing what was one of the city's cheapest theaters, Loews announced that it was raising prices at its 13 remaining theaters in Manhattan, to $10 from $9.50. The change, which became effective last Friday, made New York the only city with a double-digit movie stub. Loews also raised prices at its theaters in the other boroughs.
The markup elicited nostalgia from some. 
"I'm old enough to remember 50-cent tickets," said John Fisher, who lives in Clinton. "Prices today are obscene." DENNY LEE

The Deeper Dangers of Corporate Bankruptcy

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN D. GLATER 

 BODY:
OMINOUS increases in commercial debts, defaults and delinquencies are signaling that a new wave of bankruptcies is approaching. But many vulnerable companies may be less prepared to withstand the pain than those at risk during the last wave, a decade ago.
 Back then, the overwhelming challenge faced by corporate America was the debt itself: companies were making money, but not enough to pay creditors. Fixing corporate balance sheets by rescheduling loan payments and converting debt to equity went a long way toward solving problems. 
 Those solutions alone will not work this time, say bankruptcy and debt restructuring experts. While many struggling companies are carrying too much debt, the more difficult problems are their weak, often unprofitable businesses. 
Many companies today have assets that are hard to value and sell. They lack revenue to finance even rescheduled debt payments because their business plans assumed market demand that does not exist. As a result, bankruptcy lawyers must delve deeply into poorly planned businesses to decide whether they are even worth saving.
"In today's economy, more often than not, the company that is in distressed condition has operational problems," said Harvey Miller, a partner at Weil, Gotshal & Manges,in New York, a large law firm with a well-established bankruptcy practice. As a result, he said, eliminating debt alone "may not be sufficient to effect a reorganization."
That is a big difference from the main cause of corporate bankruptcies 10 years ago. Edward I. Altman, a finance professor at New York University's Stern School of Business who did a study for Salomon Smith Barney on corporate debt, said that from 1989 to 1991, more than half of defaults were "due to ill-fated, leveraged restructurings."
To determine whether a company in distress now can be saved, bankruptcy specialists must learn about its strategy, target market and manufacturing or production. If a company is not generating significant profits and has no imminent prospects of doing so, creditors do not want to reschedule loan payments or swap debt for equity, Mr. Miller said. Such a situation could arise, he said, if a company poured money into infrastructure, like cables or satellites, that would not generate profits for years.
If a company has overestimated demand, then "given the credit market as shaky as it is, it's difficult to get new debt to fund operations and it's as difficult, if not more difficult, to refinance the existing debt," said Dominic DiNapoli, managing partner of business recovery services at PricewaterhouseCoopers in New York.
IF refinancing is not an option, Mr. DiNapoli said, lawyers and financial advisers to the company and its creditors must quickly identify those business lines or assets that can generate enough revenue to sustain the company and pay its debts. 
Iridium Communications is an example of the problem's intractability. Iridium had planned to sell a worldwide satellite telephone service. To do so, it had to launch satellites into orbit, at huge cost. Then it had to persuade people to buy bulky, one-pound handsets to use the service.
Getting money to build and launch the satellites was, in retrospect, too easy. Finding customers was the problem. 
That left the company short on revenue and landed it in bankruptcy court, where finding a solution has proved difficult. Swapping debt for equity would not repair the balance sheet in the absence of a viable business -- why would anyone want the equity of a company with no revenue? Selling the assets required a buyer that saw value in a set of satellites serving overweight handsets. That bankruptcy appears headed for litigation to sort out who did what to whom, and who should pay. Creditors like Chase Manhattan Bank, Alliance Capital and Conseco, which once were happy to finance the satellites, are bitter.
The mistake of financing too much growth based on hope of future market demand is not confined to telecommunications and other technology companies. Several movie theater chains, including Loews Cineplex, Carmike and United Artists, have sought bankruptcy protection because they built too many new theaters financed with debt, and too few customers bought tickets.
"How did the industry believe that it could support an expansion to 37,000 screens, at a time when attendance per screen was going down?" Mr. Miller asked. 
Of course, as several lawyers pointed out, people will keep going to the movies. So the theater chains' prospects for survival are better than those of technology companies that, like Iridium, used borrowed money to bet on a product that would not generate profits for years at best.
And given good management, a company's operations can be streamlined and debts eventually paid. Even some bankrupt telecommunications companies may recover, said Bill Repko, managing director of the restructuring group at J. P. Morgan. 
Before a bankrupt company can be saved from its own mistakes, financial advisers and creditors must obtain reliable information on exactly what is generating revenue, said Al Koch, managing principal at Jay Alix & Associates, a Southfield, Mich., firm that helps distressed companies reorganize.
Equally important, he added, is finding the money-losing operations. "If I'm a retailer, do I have unprofitable stores that need to be closed?" he asked. 
The search for good information is often complicated at troubled companies because departing employees take their knowledge of the business along with them. That helps to explain why many dot-com companies that have failed over the last year have not filed for bankruptcy, lawyers say: once employees leave, there is not much in the way of assets to sell to pay creditors.
THE next step in the salvage process is determining where the more successful business lines will be most highly valued, said Corinne Ball, a Weil, Gotshal partner who represents bondholders in the Iridium bankruptcy.
"Who or what has an interest in what major part of this business surviving?" she asked. If the owners are intent on saving the business, the focus should be on helping them jettison unproductive assets. If an outside buyer is solicited, then the focus should be on having that buyer pay the highest price, she said.
The expected difficulties from a new wave of corporate bankruptcies are not completely new. They are similar to what happened in the 1970's, Mr. Miller said, when real estate investment trusts bought tracts of land, only to see their value plummet. The difficulty for bankruptcy specialists was figuring out how or whether the trusts could repay creditors when the trusts had no prospect of earning income anytime soon.
The lessons of the 70's, Mr. Repko said, are simple, if not inspiring: "The fixes will take longer, they will be more difficult, and it will be a lot more challenging to maximize the recoveries."

Learning to Love the World Trade Center

BYLINE:  By TARA BAHRAMPOUR

 BODY:
MAYBE it happened in 1974, when a Frenchman strung up a tightrope and balanced his way from one tower to the other. Maybe it was in 1977, when a man they called the human fly scaled the South Tower as hundreds of New Yorkers looked on in amazement. Or it could have been in 1975, when an unemployed construction worker parachuted from the North Tower in an attempt to draw attention to the world's poor (some office workers in the building called to report a suicide; others waved).
 But Robert Fitch, author of "The Assassination of New York" (Verso Books), has his own theory about what made New Yorkers learn to love the World Trade Center, which 10 days ago was leased to a commercial real estate firm based in Paramus, N.J., for $3.25 billion -- the largest such deal ever. 
 "King Kong was probably the watershed moment," he said, referring to the 1976 remake of the movie in which the gorilla, desperately in love with Jessica Lange, scales one of the towers. "If King Kong could love it, who are we to disagree?"
We don't. Today the World Trade Center is the city's most often-sent postcard image, it appears in countless advertisements and its familiar silhouette once formed the logo of WPIX television, underscoring the indelible mark it has made on the Manhattan skyline and the city's psyche.
It wasn't always that way. When construction began in 1966, the Twin Towers were part of a less-than-popular urban renewal plan that sought to transform shabby Lower Manhattan into a sleek business district. The 110-story towers would form a hub for international trade, and, planners hoped, would help recapture Lower Manhattan's lost title as the city's main business center. 
The project added 12 million square feet of office space, and its excavation soil formed Battery Park City. But its construction destroyed 16 acres of existing neighborhoods, and many jobs were lost. 
Besides, people thought it was ugly. "Architectural historians and art critics were mostly unimpressed," said Angus Kress Gillespie, professor of American studies at Rutgers and author of "Twin Towers" (Rutgers University Press). "They called it banal, boring, unimaginative." 
A telling sign of the times was the fact that the towers' offices were designed without light switches. Lights would simply be left on overnight. "At that time it was a rational decision," said Mr. Gillespie, noting that energy conservation was not then a priority. "But just as the building was completed, there was this big energy crisis. Everything just seemed to go wrong."
Even birds hated the World Trade Center.
"The buildings interfered with flight patterns," Mr. Gillespie said. "Birds were bumping into the buildings and dropping dead on the plaza."
But over the years Manhattanites got used to the double-cigarette silhouette hanging from the lip of their island. 
And although the World Trade Center, unlike the Brooklyn Bridge or the Empire State Building, has not inspired droves of artists, a few have warmed to its gleaming aluminum charms. The artist and architect Allan Wexler recalled going out daily at dusk to photograph the new towers. He saw them as "not just an icon but a barometer that kind of marks the changing weather and lighting conditions." As for their metaphysical qualities, "I always saw it as a sort of Tower of Babel or Jacob's Ladder," he said, "an attempt to penetrate through the cloud layer and attempt enlightenment."
Mr. Wexler was so taken that he planned several projects around the towers. One, never carried out, involved pulling down the shades of specific windows at night to allow the lighted windows to depict different images. 
"I was interested in the idea of binary surfaces," he said. The towers would be blank canvases upon which the forms of other buildings, like the Empire State Building or Notre Dame, could be etched. He described it as "a cataloguing of various images that the World Trade Center could then turn itself into," allowing the New York skyline to change nightly.
Eventually Mr. Wexler produced his own renditions of the project, as well as a photomontage in which he added a third, identical tower to the skyline.
Meanwhile, public sympathy got a boost from the daredevil acts at the towers. It helped that the city, after arresting each stuntman, played its public relations cards right. The tightrope walker was sentenced to perform a high-wire act for children in Central Park. As for the climber, George Willig, "It took hours for him to climb up," said Mr. Gillespie, adding that the feat was tracked by live television cameras. "He gets to the top, he's arrested."
To deflect negative publicity about the arresting of a folk hero, the city fined Mr. Willig one penny for each of the 110 floors he climbed. "So George Willig gives the mayor $1.10," Mr. Gillespie said, "they shake hands, and what could have been a P.R. disaster becomes the World Trade Center's first turnaround."
Another turnaround involved the views. While one tower housed an expensive restaurant, Windows on the World, the other offered an observation deck that was deliberately inexpensive. "Rank-and-file New Yorkers came to embrace the building," Mr. Gillespie said. "It's really won the hearts and minds of New Yorkers."
And of the world at large. "If you're treating it as poetry," Mr. Gillespie said, "it stands for capitalism, for free trade, for private enterprise, and, by extension, for the American dream." 
Even illegal immigrants have joined the chorus. According to the Immigration and Naturalization Service, stowaways on freighters in New York Harbor have been found carrying only a crumpled postcard of the World Trade Center. And the 1993 bombing only seemed to bolster the towers' sense of permanence, as a truckload of explosives failed to topple them. 
Technically, its title as tallest building on earth still stands, sort of. "It's not the tallest building in the world, and yet it is," said Valerie Lewis, a spokeswoman for the Alliance for Downtown New York. If you count the trade center's 316-foot antennas, she explained, it tops even the 1,483-foot Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. 
To many, the recent real estate transaction confirmed the World Trade Center's status as an indispensable city landmark.
"It was quite a change, quite an embrace," Mr. Gillespie said. "What was once kicked around by everybody is now the most precious real estate in Manhattan."

Building on Ideas for Urban Conservation

BYLINE:  By LINDA BAKER 

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore. 

 BODY:
WHEN construction crews finish converting a 105-year-old brick warehouse into an office-shopping complex here this summer, visitors will have the chance to shop for fleece outdoor wear made from recycled plastic while sipping organic coffee. Parents will be able to inquire about investing for their children's education in environmentally responsible mutual funds. 
 Small-business owners will have the opportunity to apply for loans at a bank that encourages conservation. And the building's office workers will be able to open their windows -- with frames built from certified sustainable lumber and reclaimed scrap wood. 
 "How do you turn a building into an experience of the conservation economy?" said Diane Dulken, director of the building, the Jean Vollum Natural Capital Center (named for an environmental philanthropist who helped to finance the renovation). "We're trying to provide an experience of the great new ideas that we want to become standard in the future, and that we're experimenting with right now." 
As policy makers search for solutions to the West Coast power crisis, the Natural Capital Center, near downtown, has become something of a model for the creation of buildings that conserve energy and are otherwise ecologically friendly.
The building, which was not damaged in the earthquake that hit the Pacific Northwest last week, is owned by Ecotrust, a nonprofit organization based in Portland that promotes compatibility of economic development and environmental protection. Ecotrust had spent more than $1 million on earthquake-protection measures required by the city code, according to Bettina von Hagen, director of the Natural Capital Center Fund. 
The renovation of the warehouse, once a United States Steel depot, is considered a prominent example of a national trend toward imaginative workplace architecture, as well as toward more environmentally sound buildings. It includes wide-open spaces that are supposed to encourage interaction, even to the point of eliminating some barriers between tenants. 
Ecotrust faces some challenges in making the building a success, however. For the rental space, it is charging $18 to $23 a square foot, which is considered quite high by Portland standards. So only well-financed tenants can afford leases. Partly for that reason, Ecotrust has been having trouble filling all the space. Visions of a farmer's market in the building's vast "green marketplace" atrium, for example, are now considered unrealistic. 
And while the building recycles rooftop rainwater, uses power-saving lights and has more parking spaces for bicycles than for cars, Ecotrust is not calling it an island of natural purity. The building relies on the same basic electricity and sewage services as its neighbors.
SPENCER BEEBE, Ecotrust's president and founder, acknowledged the financial challenges in an interview, saying he was concerned about repaying millions in loans. "This could eat us alive," he said.
Nonetheless, 80 percent of the 70,000 square feet of space has been rented by a combination of business and nonprofit tenants that share a commitment to environmental restoration.
Mr. Beebe, a longtime conservation activist who has worked for the Nature Conservancy and Conservation International, perhaps never envisioned himself as a landlord. He said Ecotrust was inspired to try the renovation by Jane Jacobs, an Ecotrust founding board member, whose book, "The Death and Life of Great American Cities," is enjoying a revival as a manual for innovative office design. 
The center is "a cluster of organizations which are necessarily different and diverse but are sufficiently clustered around critical themes," Mr. Beebe said. It is, he added, "a place where we hope people discover spontaneous connections and relationships with other people, other tenants, other customers, other stories."
The building is the first urban revitalization project undertaken by Ecotrust, which gained prominence several years ago by creating a fund to invest in environmentally minded businesses. It also helped to found ShoreBank Pacific, a bank that promotes environmental conservation and economic development in the Pacific Northwest. The bank is a partnership of Ecotrust and the Shorebank Corporation, a Chicago community development bank that emphasizes socially responsible investing.
Ecotrust bought the building two years ago with the help of a $2.5 million gift from Ms. Vollum, whose husband was the founder of the Tektronix Corporation, which makes high-technology products. Additional financing comes from $3.5 million in grants and $5 million in foundation and conventional loans. When the center is fully occupied, the organization hopes to generate $250,000 annually for Ecotrust programs.
THE rental rates are high partly because the building is in one of Portland's hottest real estate markets, an industrial neighborhood near the Willamette River. Patagonia, the outdoor-clothing retailer, will be the anchor tenant, occupying 8,000 square feet on the ground floor. 
At a groundbreaking ceremony last year, Michael Crooke, the chief executive of Patagonia, called the Natural Capital Center a venue for "the business partnerships of the future."
Other tenants include Progressive Investment Management, creator of Portfolio 21, a mutual fund that invests in environmentally sustainable enterprises, and ShoreBank Pacific. Carsten Henningsen, who founded Progressive Investment in 1982, said he decided to move to the Natural Capital Center rather than renovate its existing home, a Victorian-era mansion. 
Nonprofit tenants include the Certified Forest Products Council, which promotes land management that sustains forests; the Wild Salmon Center, an international organization working to protect salmon; and Ecotrust itself. A ground-floor retail area is intended to house a combination grocery store-restaurant, which will sell foods like free-range Oregon beef and oysters harvested from replenished seabeds.
The building will also house a 2,500-square-foot conference center for public lectures and workshops.
With its high-profile restoration of the warehouse, Ecotrust is beginning to have an impact on Portland's development policies and practices. Bob Naito, the main contractor for the Natural Capital Center, plans to incorporate some of the building's features in his next project, a new office building that is also in Portland's River District. 
Inspired by meetings with Ecotrust and a visit to the Natural Capital Center, the Portland City Council last month adopted legislation that requires an expedited permit process for construction projects that show concern for the environment.
"This is a huge step forward," Ms. Dulken said. "Rather than just taking into account what city-owned and managed projects can look like, this is taking it to the private sector and saying, 'What can the city do to get green building right?' "
The design of the Natural Capital Center includes an "eco roof," accessible to the public, and a filtering system that will recycle all of the building's rainwater, eliminating runoff into the Willamette River. About 97 percent of the construction debris has been reclaimed for other uses. The Portland Streetcar, a downtown mass transit system scheduled to open this summer, will have a stop in front of the building.
Inside, the architecture features skylights, wide hallways, ample public spaces and a noticeable lack of walls. Visual openness in office design, intended to promote collaboration and new ideas, is a trend among businesses and nonprofit organizations alike.
"Designing with nature as metaphor is potentially powerful and backed by some scientific data," said Judith Heerwagen, a Seattle-based psychologist and consultant. Case studies of office workers demonstrate that ecological design promotes communication and interaction and reduces stress, she said.
Ms. Heerwagen said the psychological and social effects of habitat design were not always positive. "There is evidence that noise generation due to openness is a serious problem," she said. Because of lighting problems, she added, rehabilitating an urban warehouse is also much more difficult than building a new company headquarters "out in a bucolic landscape." 
"But that's the message," she said. The Natural Capital Center shows the "congruence between the values of the work and values of the building."
For Mr. Beebe, the Natural Capital Center is a bet on the office building of the future.
"We're always searching and asking ourselves whether we're making any difference," he said. "Although we have a high tolerance for ambiguity and unpredictability, we keep asking ourselves what we are really accomplishing."

Utility Deregulation: Square Peg, Round Hole?

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
IN the forensic pursuit of what caused California's power failure, the Bush administration, the energy industry and many analysts have granted immunity to deregulation.
 Robert Shapiro, a managing director of Enron, the giant electricity marketer, says the California mess should in no way affect deregulation in other states, "because California didn't really deregulate." Spencer Abraham, the new energy secretary, said Californians simply goofed, setting up a "dysfunctional" system. It is the way California deregulated, not deregulation itself, that should take the blame, they say. 
 Yet some economists argue that California's troubles should inform the debate about whether -- not just how -- to deregulate. Among them is Alfred E. Kahn, the Cornell University economist who helped oversee the creation of free markets in the rail, trucking and airline industries.
"I am worried about the uniqueness of electricity markets," Mr. Kahn said. He is still studying whether the design flaws in California's market explain the whole problem. But he is sounding a note of skepticism.
"I've always been uncertain about eliminating vertical integration," he said, referring to the old ways of allowing a single, heavily regulated power company to produce, transmit and distribute electricity. "It may be one industry in which it works reasonably well."
Mr. Kahn's comments might sound a little heretical. When this former Carter administration official was pushing deregulation, it was still a novel and politically risky concept. Today, getting government out of most businesses is part of the Washington economic canon.
Moreover, few people believe that California, the first state to overhaul its electricity sector from top to bottom, has proved a good laboratory. To satisfy interest groups, the markets were designed in an awkward way, which soured some deregulation experts on California before the first electron went on the auction block.
Among the quirks: The state required utilities to buy nearly all their power on daily spot markets, rather than arranging long-term contracts that might have allowed them to hedge risk. Consumer prices were also fixed, making it impossible for utilities to pass on higher wholesale costs.
Paul L. Joskow, an expert on electricity markets at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a former student of Mr. Kahn's, remains hopeful that the kinks can be ironed out.
In New England and the the Middle Atlantic states, as well in as Britain, Chile and Argentina, all places that have restructured electricity markets, regulators have had to adjust market rules to correct flaws. They have found ways to check the tendency of power sellers to exploit infant markets and charge high prices, Mr. Joskow said.
Regulators have also had to establish new markets that, through price signals, encourage power companies to build enough generating capacity so that they have reserves for peak hours. During peak hours, shortages and price spikes can substantially raise average prices.
"If they can do it in Britain, Chile and Argentina, then I think we can do it here," Mr. Joskow said.
Still, he warns that proper regulation requires tough political choices. Allowing high prices to pass through to consumers is one. Making sure Nimbyism does not prevent the construction of power plants is another.
"The political system must rise to the task," Mr. Joskow said, or the "old way might be the best we can do."
Mr. Kahn knows a bit about the old way. In the mid-1970's, he headed the New York Public Service Commission, which oversaw electricity and other regulated industries. The drawbacks were legendary. Local utilities had an endemic tendency to overestimate demand to justify new power plants, for which consumers paid through steady rate increases. Nearly everyone assumed that competition would slash prices.
But though free markets do a better job managing rail, phone and airline prices, they have yet to match regulators' ability to juggle the complexities of electricity, Mr. Kahn said.
Regulators tended to apply heavy political pressure on utilities to keep prices as low as possible and profit margins steady but thin. The vertical integration of electricity monopolies may have also had advantages, Mr. Kahn said. Engineers coordinated power plants and transmission lines in ideal ways. Planners who saw the need for new plants helped find a place for them to be built. "The players all depended on one another," he said.
California has probably not derailed deregulation efforts. But it has made people wonder anew whether market forces work for kilowatts as they do for widgets.

HEADLINE: Ideas & Trends; 
Turning Memory Into Travesty

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN 

 BODY:
WHAT is the purpose of a modern memorial -- of a monument to someone or something that is meant to last forever? And must it be good art? And who decides?
 Such questions are at the core of the debate over the planned $100 million World War II Memorial on the Mall in Washington, which, as presently envisioned, is an aesthetic disaster, a prime example of bureaucratic high kitsch style not implausibly described as watered-down Albert Speer by a few critics. 
 The plan by Friedrich St. Florian, an Austrian-trained architect from Rhode Island, entails a giant sunken stone plaza and reflecting pool, 56 17-foot-high commemorative pillars, two four-story triumphal arches, gold stars, monumental bronze eagles, bronze wreaths and fountains smack in between the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial, one of the most symbolic stretches of turf in the United States.
And that's the scaled-back version of Mr. St. Florian's original idea. 
Arriving at a memorial to the good war, in which 400,000 Americans died and 16 million Americans served in uniform, has so far been an endlessly drawn-out, nasty affair. It has been 14 years since the idea for a memorial was first brought up in Congress in 1987. The proposal has been in the approval process longer than it took to defeat Hitler. But this has not forestalled accusations that powerful supporters, without providing adequate public notification, deviously exploited the system to push through the site on the Mall rather than an adjacent site, at Constitution Gardens, which had been the initially approved location. Detractors are now suing in federal court to stop construction.
The major problem with putting the memorial on the Mall is that it disrupts the link between monuments dedicated to the leaders of the two defining events in the nation's history: the Revolution and the Civil War. Never mind that the plan also breaks up a glorious open space, laid out by the great landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted Jr., as an extension of Pierre L'Enfant's utopian plan for the city.
Critics also assert that the 7.4-acre memorial project, which will require the lowering and shrinking of the Mall's existing Rainbow Pool, will make it difficult, if not impossible, for there ever to be another gathering akin to Martin Luther King's 1963 rally.
Simply put, this is as close to sacred public ground as the nation has -- a space that itself memorializes America's history and ideals. And even those who aren't reminded of Hitler's favorite architect when they look at the design should still recognize a sterile and insufficiently meaningful plan when they see it.
The question, of course, is, so what?
Mount Rushmore is camp. Grant's Tomb is not. Which attracts more visitors? The new sculpture of F.D.R. in a wheelchair, which has been added to the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial in Washington, is appalling sculpture (it might have appalled him, too) but it satisfies a current, humane agenda of dignifying the disabled through association with the great man.
"Memory is never shaped in a vacuum, the motives of memory are never pure," James E. Young, a historian of memorials, has observed. Every era, he points out, constructs memorials to inculcate its own priorities in succeeding generations.
And memorials are intended, even if not explicitly, to stimulate some debate. Otherwise they aren't doing their job, which is to keep the subjects memorialized on the public's front burner.
Arguments about Maya Lin's Vietnam Veterans Memorial rekindled discussions about that war and about the war's place in America's memory, altering national perceptions in the process.
Even Henry Bacon's classical temple, the Lincoln Memorial, dedicated in 1922, now revered like Ms. Lin's work, was delayed because of protests that encapsulated national divisions of opinion. Southern opponents of Lincoln didn't want it built. Lincoln's supporters considered the architecture too pompous, and they thought that that end of the Mall, at the time a swamp, was unworthy of the Republic's savior.
This sort of controversy obviously isn't unique to the United States. The recently finished Holocaust memorial in Vienna, by the British sculptor Rachel Whiteread, also took years between conception and completion. In that case the delay was due to Jewish opposition to the design (an abstract library turned inside-out), and to Austrian foot-dragging about putting in stone the uncomfortable facts of national guilt.
The lag let opponents iron out various differences. Now everyone in Vienna, or at least everyone willing to speak up, seems satisfied with the results and says the project provoked useful debate about what is still a topic that fastidious Austrians generally consider in poor taste.
So where does art enter the picture?
Nathan Rapoport, responding to criticism that his Warsaw Ghetto Monument, a realist sculpture of dead and battling Jews, was inadequate to the enormity of its subject, asked, rhetorically: "Could I have made a rock with a hole in it and said, 'Voila! The heroism of the Jewish people'?" Neither abstraction nor realism, he realized, was going to be universally acceptable as a style for memorializing the uprising.
Tastes differ. Taste can be a convenient excuse for protesting a monument whose subject it is otherwise taboo to criticize. Also the exercise of taste is a matter of authority. Both sides in the World War II Memorial debate claim to speak for the veterans, as if veterans were, in their taste, a monolithic group.
CENTURIES ago everything was different and simpler. Public art was commissioned by kings, queens, popes and dukes, who answered to no one. Great monuments expressed official taste, which was synonymous with high art. Michelangelo's genius ensured that the Medicis would be remembered after their death because his memorial to them in Florence became a pilgrimage site for art lovers.
Democracy and the modern era altered all that. Official art in a democracy requires consensus opinion, an aesthetic common denominator. But, as Kirk Varnedoe, a curator at the Museum of Modern Art, points out, "Modern art is about one person's vision and the idea of a consensus vision is antithetical to it."
Consider van Gogh's "Starry Night." It was a quintessential work of modern art because it was an eccentric vision. Only after popular taste caught up with van Gogh did it become everyone's dream.
The memorial quandary is not just a problem of consensus, however. Modern artists love ambiguity and irony. Monument builders hate ambiguity and irony. Maya Lin's Vietnam War memorial, being an ambiguous work of abstraction, is the exception to the rule and it depends on our national ambiguity toward that war, an exceptional situation.
Moreover, when modern artists make monuments they mostly make anti-monuments: Claes Oldenburg's giant sculptures of clothespins and lipsticks imply that what we share today as a society is no longer a set of common ideals but a bunch of everyday household objects and consumer desires.
"The notion of a modern monument," the critic Lewis Mumford wrote 63 years ago, "is a contradiction in terms. If it is a monument, it is not modern, and if it is modern, it cannot be a monument."
So is it really any surprise that an official monument to the most unambiguous of modern wars should be regarded by so many people as such a lousy work of modern art?
B UT why should it matter? In the end, because great art outlasts historical memory. George Bernard Shaw predicted he would someday appear as an encyclopedia entry: Shaw, George Bernard, the subject of a bust by Rodin.
"Art has the capacity to transcend history that history doesn't have by itself," Mr. Varnedoe adds, meaning that great art's inexhaustible fascination causes people to want to return to it, to be in its presence, long after the events that prompted the artist to make the work join 1066 and 1848 as dry facts in high school textbooks.
Great art is of course always hard to come by. Good art would suffice. The pity is that the veterans of World War II, who deserve something commensurate to their sacrifice, will be remembered by such a forgettable memorial.

HEADLINE: The Quirks of Behavior, as Part of Economics 

 BODY:
In "Following the Money, but Also the Mind" (Feb. 11), Louis Uchitelle discussed the increasing influence of behavioral economists -- those who say economics should do more than assume that people act with rational, unemotional self-interest. The article drew varied responses from many readers. A sampling follows.

To the Editor:
 The article describes a promising trend in bringing economics more in line with its true nature as a social science. 
 The mainstream critique sounds like a tautology. It is done; therefore it is rational. The analysis that all self-destructive behavior is somehow rational makes it devoid of any real explanatory use.
It will be helpful to the new breed of researchers to establish links to other heterodox schools of the discipline, such as institutional and feminist economics. These practitioners are engaged in revealing the crucial role of institutions and culture in economic behavior.
For example, feminist economists attribute great importance to altruism, reciprocity and oppressive cultural norms in their analysis. It would serve behavioral economists well to study their findings more carefully. And one variable that seems to be missing from their agenda is that of power, which can make economic outcomes inefficient from a social perspective.

 A problem with the article lies not in the people it mentions but in the names it omits by putting Harvard and M.I.T. at the center of the behavioral revolution. 
 Long before experimental work became fashionable at Harvard or M.I.T., behavioral economics was flourishing in other schools. A number of schools (including Arizona, Pittsburgh, California Institute of Technology and Iowa) handed out Ph.D.'s in behavioral economics long before the early 1990's.
The behavioral revolution in economics is much more exciting, much more widespread and much more democratic than the article makes it out to be.

To the Editor:
 Having uncovered that people, and therefore markets, sometimes act irrationally, you suggest that "25 years of deregulation might lose its appeal." 
 To the contrary, regulation, and all political processes, are subject to the same irrational and destructive human foibles that sometimes infect markets. Please refer to world history for voluminous proof. Market processes are usually preferable to political processes because they work through highly decentralized volition rather than centralized compulsion.

To the Editor:
 As an anthropologist who studies the history of capitalism, the questions guiding the new behavioral economics do seem obvious. I am nevertheless encouraged by the trend. 
 While rational-choice theory, and the highly abstract mathematical models that are built upon it, have served big business well since the late 1970's, as a dominant point of view it has done much damage to economics as social science. Much of mainstream economic research is irrelevant for those of us who are interested in the relationship between economic behavior and, more broadly, economic growth and transformation, and the rest of social and political life. Indeed, we are better off looking to Marx, Keynes, and even Adam Smith for insight, as the article suggested.
The social, political and psychological contexts framing basic economic decisions that people make are not mere "externalities," as mainstream economics might have it. They are integral to the way an economy as a whole works, and one must understand them and try to change them if one wants to make an economy work better, for the general welfare.
My hope is that this new breed of economists does not shy away from the critical questions about our deregulated economy that their research already seems to be raising.

To the Editor:
 We who have labored in behavioral economics for decades appreciate your raising the awareness of this traditionally heterodox area in economics, and we applaud its now-apparent entry into the mainstream. It is intriguing that the more prestigious training centers are now seeing the efficacy of the approaches we have been using in behavioral economics for a quite long time. 
 Perhaps it is not well known, for example, that we who study the behavior of farmers and ranchers in this country have demonstrated with robust empirical testing that they pursue both a self-interest and an "others-interest." On a practical and understandable level, we all experience the reality that the supermarkets are generally full of high-quality food provided at a reasonable cost, all of which attests to the scientific reality that farmers and ranchers (and the food channel generally) go well beyond self-interest in designing and operating their production operations.
We also believe that the appearance of more behavioral economists on the scene is timely. But then, maybe this was also true at the time of Adam Smith, who was perhaps the first behavioral economist. Smith understood the role of an others-interest, as we project ourselves into the role of the impartial spectator and act with sympathy in pursuing the self-interest, as a necessary condition to achieving the true wealth of a nation.

 "The Dot-Com Jobless, at Play" (Preludes, Feb. 18) discussed the sense of relief and self-renewal that dot-com workers can find when they are laid off. But the column glossed over the dark side of those layoffs -- trying to live off of stock options that have lost their value and severance pay that may not last long, the difficulty of finding a job when other dot-coms are also laying off workers, and the sense that you and what you do are not very important anymore. 
 And those are the problems of the most skilled and professional workers. The situation is much bleaker for clerical and sales workers who are laid off.

HEADLINE: Israel's Ties With Germany Elude U.S. Jews 

BYLINE:  By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: TEL AVIV, Feb. 25 

 BODY:
Avi Primor, a former Israeli ambassador to Germany, travels regularly to the United States to tell American Jewish groups how good Israeli-German ties have become. "Their reaction," he said, "is often one of shock, pain and indignation. They want to preserve Germany in their minds as a negative nation."
 From the ashes of the Holocaust, a curious friendship has been born: 56 years after the fall of Hitler's Reich, and 36 years after the establishment of diplomatic relations, Germany has become Israel's most important ally outside the United States, providing critical support in the military, intelligence, political and economic fields. 
 But this rapprochement -- not widely advertised, but continually growing -- has largely eluded the relationship between Germany and American Jews. 
Indeed, as memory of the Holocaust looms large in American life, and wrangles persist over compensation for Jewish victims of the Nazis, the American Jewish view of Germany often seems mired in the Nazi past alone.
"American Jews have always been a step or two behind Israel in understanding Germany's postwar evolution," said David A. Harris, the executive director of the American Jewish Committee. 
"American Jews have had the luxury of avoiding Germany, even boycotting its products -- a luxury Israel could not afford."
The result is an odd disparity: in recent years, Germany has intensified its ties with Israel, quietly providing three submarines, as the difficulties between American Jews and Germany have multiplied and the feeling has spread among Germans that they are the objects of a "Holocaust industry."
"The recent negotiations on compensation for slave and forced laborers under the Nazis have left rancor in Germany," said Deidre Berger, who directs the office of the American Jewish Committee in Berlin. "Many German companies feel they are being blackmailed by American Jews. On the other side, there's a lot of enduring prejudice in the American Jewish community -- the prejudice that Germany can never be trusted."
Of course, hostility to Germans exists in Israel, too, and commemoration of the Holocaust remains important. Kirsten Praefcke-Meron, a German woman married to an Israeli in Tel Aviv, recalls an Israeli child pointing to her daughter in school on a recent Holocaust Memorial Day and saying, "She's a Nazi."
Among American Jews, meanwhile, there are signs of growing interest in the contemporary democratic reality of Germany rather than its Nazi past. The move of the capital to Berlin has caused new curiosity; five major American Jewish groups are scheduled to visit this year -- an unprecedented exchange.
Still, the responses to Germany of the Jewish state and of Jews in America remain a study in divergent paths and psychologies.
The former relationship has been driven by pragmatic involvement, shared postwar experiences and the effect of Israel's experience fighting wars since the Holocaust, which by no means defines Israeli identity.
The first Israeli passports, issued after the state's creation in 1948, declared themselves valid "for all states except Germany." But, long before diplomatic relations were established in 1965, the first rapprochement occurred with the 1952 accord on German reparations reached between David Ben-Gurion, the Israeli prime minister, and Chancellor Konrad Adenauer.
The reparations would involve the payment of over $50 billion, to individual Israelis and to the state of Israel. Because some reparations were paid in kind -- machinery, industrial investment, spare parts, ships, locomotives -- they brought postwar Germans and Israelis together in a way that has scant equivalent with American Jews.
Israelis had to learn from Germans how to use the machinery and ships -- and friendships were formed. Most Israelis gained the feeling that the financial consequences of the Holocaust were settled -- hence their indifference, even irritation, at the recent American Jewish push for compensation from German industry.
By contrast, Germany's relationship with American Jews has often suffered from distance, bitterness and what sometimes looks to Germans like an American Jewish fixation on a traumatic past.
With the cold war over, the last generation of Holocaust survivors dying, and other sources of Jewish identity weakening, the Holocaust has become a crucial touchstone. American Jews used to identify with Israel as a plucky, isolated Jewish state, and with the plight of Soviet Jewry. But now Israel has become a regional power whose policies in the occupied territories are, for some at least, hard to defend, and the Soviet issue has disappeared. 
Today, an investigation in Germany and Israel suggests, German support is central to Israel's security, even if it is kept quiet partly because of German concerns about the reactions of the Arab world and domestic public opinion. 
Relations between the two countries' intelligence services are particularly intense, officials said. Germany provides Israel with extensive information on the Arab world, and Israel reciprocates with intelligence on Eastern Europe and Russia where, in the words of one informed Israeli, "we have people with a lot of understanding."
Germany, for example, is acting quietly to secure the release of three Israeli soldiers kidnapped last October by Hezbollah, the Shiite Muslim militant group based in Lebanon.
Germany is also Israel's second-most-important military partner, after the United States, working together on development of some weapons, providing technology and giving Israel two highly sophisticated submarines (while splitting the cost of a third) as a gesture after the Persian Gulf war. 
Germany has become Israel's second-largest trading partner, after the United States, and sends more tourists to Israel than any country except America. As for politics, Germany "is now our mainstay and chief advocate in Europe," said Reuven Merhav, a former director-general at the Israeli Foreign Ministry.
In effect, European Middle East policy is largely determined by Germany's role in counterbalancing France's stance as the most forthright supporter in Europe of the Palestinian cause.
The annual human rights report of the German Foreign Ministry contains no reference to Israeli actions in the occupied territories, in contrast to the criticism of extrajudicial Israeli killings of Palestinians in the equivalent American report. 
"Relations between Germany and Israel are special and must never normalize themselves in the sense that we have normal relations with Holland or the United States," said Rudolf Dressler, the German ambassador to Israel. "We feel co-responsible that the existence of Israel be guaranteed, and the political consequence is that, when in doubt, we side with Israel, because that is our unique duty."
Born in 1940, the son of a German who resisted Hitler, Mr. Dressler said he felt that he could legitimately ask himself what responsibility he bears for the Holocaust and for safeguarding the Jewish state, whose birth was linked in some ways to Hitler's onslaught on the Jews of Europe. 
"Of course I ask, how could the Nazis do this and what do I have to do with what they did?" the ambassador said. "But they did it, and we have to live with it. There is no time limit for what the Germans did. And so we help Israel."
Bernhard Steubing is 21, a volunteer who has shunned military service to work for Aktion Suhnezeichen -- literally Action Sign of Atonement -- a group that has brought hundreds of young Germans to Israel since the 1950's. He helps handicapped people and Holocaust survivors.
"I felt it was important to do something because of the past, and while Holocaust survivors are still alive," he said. "I feel close to Israelis, although sometimes it is strange to find myself in this very nationalistic country, having refused to go to the German Army because I am against nationalism."
Germany and Israel are indeed an odd couple in this sense -- the most postnational of European states allied with one of the most nationalistic. But their closeness has grown steadily past what once seemed the impenetrable wall of Hitler's annihilation of European Jewry.
In Germany, the immediate postwar years were marked by an attempt to bury the past, to find the elusive closure on the Holocaust for which many Germans still quest today.
In Israel, the initial reaction was also evasive because the Holocaust provoked a sense of humiliation on which the country preferred to turn its back. "We were raised as the better, proud Jews who could fight back, unlike our brothers who went like sheep to the slaughter," Mr. Primor said. "We thought, wrongly, that the victims humiliated us. They were insulted as the 'Sabonim' -- the Jews gassed and turned into soap by the Nazis."
Over decades, Germany came to terms with its Nazi past and Israel adopted the view that Hitler's victims were lured and coerced to their fate.
"The coming-together was a long and painful process," said Mr. Merhav, the retired senior diplomat who is himself the son of German immigrants to Israel. "But postwar Germany won over the body politic of Israel through a constant policy of friendship. American Jews, of course, were never exposed to this sort of practical friendship, and I suspect their anger at Germany is also anger at themselves, for they were very late to realize what was going on in Europe."
One Israeli, Gabriel Bach -- a Jew born in Berlin in 1927, chased out of Germany in 1938, and later the chief prosecutor at the trial of Adolf Eichmann -- finds that painful memory and appreciation of the new Germany still confront each other.
In Berlin recently, he was strolling in a central park when his wife pointed out the geraniums in each and every window of the nearby apartments. "And I looked up and what I saw was the ocean of swastikas that had adorned those same windows in the 1930's," Mr. Bach said. "There were swastikas on every balcony. She spoke of flowers and I saw that."
The past is still haunting -- but, for Mr. Bach, it is the past. Eichmann's trial was a moment of epiphany, he said, when the man who planned to destroy the Jews stood at attention before the symbols of the Jewish state in an Israeli courtroom.
Israelis' national pride, and struggles, seem to have led them -- like Mr. Bach -- to view Germany with less prejudice, and more self-confidence, and more pragmatic engagement than many American Jews.
"I can't feel any resentment toward Germans not born at the time of Hitler," Mr. Bach said.
Reinhard Wiemer, a German diplomat married to an Israeli and now stationed in Tel Aviv, has also served in the United States. In Washington, he said, they lived in a largely Jewish neighborhood. "People would ask my wife: how could you marry a German?" he recalled. "That does not happen here."
He sees several reasons for the difference between Israeli attitudes and what he called the suspicion and prejudice of American Jews toward Germany, including an Israeli identity that is less tied to the Holocaust than that of American Jews, the broad Israeli knowledge that Germany has helped the country a lot, and the stereotyping of Germans in American movies and television.
The situation is improving, he believes, but slowly, and the recent rise in anti-Semitic incidents in Germany naturally encourages those who wish to freeze their image of Germany in the past.
Mr. Wiemer enjoys Israel, but finds that being a German diplomat is often subject to the self-restraint that has helped build a remarkable alliance. "I think Israel should give back the occupied territories," Mr. Wiemer said. "I do not hide this, I tell my friends, and they do not object. But in public, as a German, you have to shut up."

CORRECTION-DATE: March 6, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sunday about warmth in German-Israeli relations misstated the background of Gabriel Bach, an Israeli who compared his appreciation for Germany's current role with his painful memories of being expelled from Berlin in 1938. He was a prosecutor in the trial of Adolf Eichmann; the chief prosecutor was Gideon Hausner.

HEADLINE: Presidents Are Set to Step Down At Columbia and N.Y.U. in '02 

BYLINE:  By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
The presidents of Columbia University and New York University, two of the most popular colleges in the country in recent years, have told their trustees that they plan to step down next year.
 The decisions by George Rupp, Columbia's president since 1993, and L. Jay Oliva, N.Y.U.'s president since 1991, were unrelated but are occurring in a similar context. Both men have helped build their universities' reputations, endowments, physical facilities and academic reach in a period of exceptional prosperity for higher education and New York City. 
 Neither tenure has been without its rough spots, including disputes over issues like worker pay, new buildings, ethnic studies and animal rights. But over all, both presidents benefited from the city's renewed popularity and the long-running bull market, and their successors will face a less certain economic climate. 
Moreover, the resignations thrust both universities into the market for presidents at a busy time. Three Ivy League universities have been on the prowl in recent months: Harvard is said to be close to announcing a new president; Princeton is searching for one; and Brown recently named Ruth J. Simmons, the president of Smith College, who will take office on July 1.
In New York, the City University of New York must fill open presidencies at both City College and at Queens College, and Marymount Manhattan College is searching for a president.
While uptown Columbia, a member of the Ivy League and one of the nation's oldest universities, remains the tonier of the two institutions, N.Y.U. in Greenwich Village, a onetime commuter college for the working class, has risen markedly in the last two decades. Today, in some fields, the two are rivals.
At Columbia, where Dr. Rupp's resignation took most people by surprise, perhaps a half-dozen internal candidates might be considered to succeed him, including the provost, the executive vice provost and several deans. At N.Y.U., John Sexton, the dean of its law school, is widely viewed as a strong candidate to follow Dr. Oliva, a specialist in Russian history. Mr. Sexton has helped propel N.Y.U. Law School into one of the country's best and has worked closely with Martin Lipton, N.Y.U.'s chairman and the former chairman of the law school's board. Both universities say they will conduct national searches. 
Dr. Rupp, 58, told the university's trustees at a board meeting yesterday that he would leave the presidency on July 1, 2002. He said that he had been a university administrator -- a dean or a president -- for 25 years without a break, and that he wanted to move on at a time when the university and he were riding high, when the university was ready to fashion its next strategic plan and while he was still young and vigorous enough for one more new career. 
Dr. Oliva, 67, said in a telephone interview from London on Friday that he would step down on June 1, 2002 -- "after two more commencements." The university began notifying trustees on Friday. Dr. Oliva has been at N.Y.U. since 1960 and has been an administrator there -- a dean, vice president, provost and chancellor -- since 1972. (He was named dean of N.Y.U.'s Bronx campus after the university had announced its sale, an experience he likens to being made captain of the Titanic after it hit the iceberg.)
He said that he had wanted to stay in office until the university's student center was complete -- a project he said he had dreamed about since moving to the Washington Square campus in 1973.
When Dr. Rupp was picked to succeed Michael I. Sovern at Columbia, the university had climbed a long way back from the student revolts and battles with the local Morningside Heights community of the late 1960's. But the campus was bursting at the seams and tensions remained, and the trustees said they wanted a president with a proven track record to raise more money, expand the campus and build the faculty and student body.
Dr. Rupp, an ordained Presbyterian minister and a religions scholar, became dean of Harvard Divinity School at 37, president of Rice University at 42 and president of Columbia at 50. He was seen as an efficient, proven administrator adept at building coalitions. 
Under him, Columbia became one of the most selective Ivy League universities. Over the last decade, applications to Columbia College, the undergraduate liberal arts college, have more than doubled, to 14,070 this year, and the college now admits only 13 percent of applicants. (The whole university has about 20,000 full-time and 2,100 part-time students.)
Driven by a booming stock market and a $2 billion-plus fund-raising campaign, donations surged. Last year, Columbia received more than $440 million in cash or pledges; its endowment is now more than $4 billion, approximately double what it was when Dr. Rupp arrived, although still far below some of its Ivy League competitors. (Harvard's endowment is nearly $20 billion.)
The university has added an architecturally distinguished student center, expanded student housing and taken over the management of Biosphere 2, the controlled habitat in the Arizona desert near Tucson. Columbia has generally mended relations with the Morningside Heights community, though, as Dr. Rupp noted, "that is a tender achievement that can always flare up." (When Columbia recently announced its plan to build a new home for its social work school on 113th Street west of Broadway, the community protested, and the university pulled back.)
But, as Dr. Rupp acknowledged, there is plenty more to do, including enhancing Columbia's efforts in digital media, increasing faculty housing, finding more space for university research efforts and continuing its fund-raising.
"We have tremendous forward momentum," he said, "but it is not an institution that will ever be complete."
N.Y.U., which has about 25,000 full-time graduate and undergraduate students and another 25,000 in its continuing education programs, has experienced similar expansion in recent years, as it climbed into the top tier of American research universities.
"Twenty-five years ago, we had just gotten enough money to extricate ourselves from the brink of bankruptcy," said Mr. Lipton, the N.Y.U. chairman. He said that John Brademas, N.Y.U.'s president from 1981 to 1991 and a former congressman from Indiana, laid the base for the university's transformation by sharply increasing fund-raising and building dormitories to accommodate students from around the world. 
"Under Jay Oliva, we have really achieved much of what we dreamt of 25 years ago," Mr. Lipton said. "We have finished the transformation from a regional commuter school to a global university."
In the last 10 years, applications for freshman admission have tripled, to nearly 31,000 in 2001, and the acceptance rate fell to 29 percent last year from 65 percent in 1991. At the same time, the average freshman SAT score climbed nearly 150 points, to 1334 last year. Annual donations totaled $334 million, up from $106 million in 1991. 
Student housing has more than doubled, to 10,600 beds, since 1991, and will grow to more than 11,000 next fall.
Mr. Lipton said additional student and faculty housing was a high priority, as are improved research laboratories. 
In searching for new presidents, both universities will seek managers who are sensitive to the academic culture but capable of leading complex institutions with billion-dollar budgets that are among the largest employers and landholders in New York City. 
Henry King, a lawyer at Davis Polk & Wardwell who is a former Columbia board chairman and who led the search committee that chose Dr. Rupp, has agreed to lead Columbia's latest search, which he said would probably take about seven months. He said he hoped to form a committee with trustees, faculty and a student shortly, and to have a successor by February at the latest. 
"If you concentrate on those people with real scholarship and standing who have some experience running a university," he said, "the pool is small."
At N.Y.U., Mr. Lipton, the board chairman, will lead the search. He said that he expected that a committee would be named soon after the board meeting on Tuesday. 
"There are a relatively small number of people who would receive serious consideration, including people inside N.Y.U. and presidents and provosts at other universities," he said. "There are perhaps a half-dozen who would be considered. I think we know who the people are." 
Dr. Oliva said he had no specific plans after he formally steps down but expected to stay around the university to make sure that initiatives he started are completed. "I've made a lot of commitments to folks who've been donors and friends and supporters," he said. "And I plan to see them through."
Dr. Rupp, who had told Columbia's trustees from his arrival that he expected to stay no more than 8 or 10 years, said he was not sure what he would do next. One possibility, he said, was writing and teaching at Columbia, perhaps Contemporary Civilization, a core curriculum course, and some religion courses. He does not plan to take on a third university presidency. "It would be anticlimactic," he said, looking relaxed. "Been there. Done that."

Israel's Ties With Germany Elude American Jews
Germany has become Israel's most important ally outside the United States, providing critical support in the military, intelligence, political and economic fields. But this rapprochement has largely eluded the relationship between Germany and American Jews. 1

Russian Tests Raise Concern
Intelligence officials and nuclear analysts in Washington are embroiled in a bitter dispute over a series of what Russia calls non-nuclear tests. Some experts think Russia is lying and that the tests are small nuclear blasts, others say that charge is reckless and probably wrong. 14

Disease Fears on the Continent
France and Belgium reported suspected outbreaks of the highly contagious foot-and-mouth disease inside their borders. In both cases, preliminary tests were negative, but the farms were quarantined while final results are awaited early this week. 9

The United States government constructed a secret tunnel under the Soviet Union's embassy in Washington to eavesdrop. Federal investigators now believe the operation was betrayed by Robert Philip Hanssen, the F.B.I. agent who was arrested last month on charges of spying for Moscow, current and former United States intelligence and law enforcement officials said. 1

Tour Was Sub's Only Mission
The Feb. 9 training run of the U.S.S. Greeneville, which led to the accidental sinking of a Japanese fishing trawler, was made solely to accommodate the Navy's efforts to promote itself, officials have acknowledged. A court of inquiry into the sinking is to convene tomorrow. 1

HEADLINE: Hartford Journal; 
Officials' Trip to China Angers Flagging City

BYLINE:  By PAUL ZIELBAUER 

 BODY:
Finding a friendly statistic in this town is not easy. One of four residents lives in poverty, three of four adults cannot read beyond grade-school level, and more teenage girls get pregnant each year than graduate from high school.
 In Hartford, unemployment, at about 10 percent, is five times the state average. A state board runs the city's public schools. A 1973 federal court order to clean up a badly managed and unaccredited police force has yet to be carried out. In the last two years, seven police officers have been accused or convicted of having sex with prostitutes on city time. 
 "The city has deep and serious problems," said Nicholas R. Carbone, a former deputy mayor and the president of the Connecticut Institute for Municipal Studies. 
So when city officials announced last summer that they were taking an official nine-day trip to Dongguan, China, and supplied only vague statements about who they were meeting and how they were paying for it, some people got angry.
Eunice Groark, a member of the city's economic development commission and a former lieutenant governor, called the trip unfortunate and "half-cocked." John W. Olsen, Connecticut's A.F.L.-C.I.O. president, declared that city officials had no business flying to China when parts of Hartford's North End still resembled a third-world country.
Still, Mayor Mike Peters and the city manager, Saundra Kee Borges, refused to budge. 
But in mid-August, The Hartford Courant ran a lengthy editorial denouncing the mysterious "junket" to Dongguan, a fast-growing factory city that had recently been described in an article in The New York Times as one of China's leading "concubine villages," where businessmen from Hong Kong, two hours to the south, kept mistresses. 
Stung by criticism, some city officials who had planned to go, like John B. O'Connell, a Republican member of the City Council, backed out. Mr. Peters and Ms. Kee Borges put off the China trip -- until last month. 
In an interview Friday, Mr. O'Connell said he decided against going after he asked other city officials for an itinerary. "It sounded poorly planned and poorly conceived," he said.
Despite the negative publicity and the questions about who was paying, on Feb. 15, 24 city officials, business people, professors and lawyers left for a shortened, eight-day official visit.
All of the delegates, except the seven Hartford officials who went, paid their own way. Thomas Phillips, Hartford's grants and policy administrator who organized the trip, said that Dongguan businessmen had given the city $7,200 for the officials' airfare. He added that he hoped the Connecticut China Council, a private nonprofit trade group, would come up with $4,800 in corporate donations to pay hotel and other expenses.
In China, Mr. Phillips said, he and other officials saw many fascinating things, including a "truly amazing" lion dance, but they did not return with fistfuls of contracts. Their visit did convince a wealthy Dongguan mall developer to promise to go to Hartford this year to discuss building a "China Village," a miniature Chinatown, in the city. He added that the leaders of Dongguan, a city of 3.2 million whose economy is based on a young female migrant work force, expressed interest in building an "American Village" in their city.
To people like Mr. Carbone, the former deputy mayor and a frequent City Hall critic, the trip showed how little city officials care about those miserable statistics of Hartford life.
But in time, some officials say, the Dongguan trip may prove its critics wrong. "For some reason, we in central Connecticut seem to think that international business is something that people from New York and Boston do," said the Connecticut China Council's chairman, John H. Schuyler.

Watching the Fed, and Selling Anew

BYLINE:  By DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN 

 BODY:
Dashed hopes of an imminent Federal Reserve rate cut left stock market investors running for cover as companies continued to roll out profit warnings last week.
 JDS Uniphase and 3Com, each facing a slowdown in its business, announced layoffs, while Texas Instruments, Procter & Gamble, Gateway and Oracle all said they would not meet earnings expectations. 
 Despite reports of falling consumer confidence, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, hinted strongly in Congressional testimony that the Fed would not cut interest rates before its next scheduled meeting. 
 There was some good news. Consumer spending showed surprising strength in January, and manufacturing activity rebounded, suggesting that the economy is not as weak as many people fear.
 For the week, the Nasdaq fell 144.88, or 6.4 percent, to 2,117.63. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 11.68 points, or 0.9 percent, to 1,234.18. The Dow industrials edged up 24.41, or 0.2 percent, to 10,466.31. 
 The general selloff in the equity markets gave the bond market a big lift. The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond finished at 4.94 percent, down from 5.09 percent the week before. DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN

A 'Sopranos' Secret: Given the Choice, We'd All Be Mobsters

BYLINE:  By BILL TONELLI; Bill Tonelli is an editor at Rolling Stone magazine.

 BODY:
AROUND 11 o'clock tonight, I promise you, it'll start up again -- the fury, the bitterness, the great howling hurt. To you, it's entertainment. To us, it's the reopening of a culture skirmish that started 30 years ago, when Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola created "The Godfather" and its sequel, then spread when Martin Scorsese kicked in "Goodfellas," the success of which only set the stage for the current provocation: the new season of "The Sopranos." This is seen as quite possibly the most degrading and dangerous spectacle yet, if only because it goes into unsuspecting America's living rooms, over and over, and will soon be in the neighborhood of 40 hours long -- our "Berlin Alexanderplatz" of shame.
 The fight hinges on this: Are these and other depictions of Mafia myth, legend and reality merely works of entertainment beloved by all, including us Italian-Americans, who for the most part feel flattered by the excellence of the attentions? Or are they egregious acts of bigotry made only worse by the fact that their perpetrators are themselves members of the family, so to speak? (And also, no doubt, by the fact that the characters in question are so far down the glamour scale from the decorous racketeers created by Puzo and Mr. Coppola -- the Corleones being our Kennedys; the Sopranos, our Simpsons.) 
 The creator of "The Sopranos," David Chase, an Italian-American with a suspiciously Anglicized name, has been vilified and attacked without letup by ethnic activists and other touchy types since the series began, and the intensity only grows. A press release last year from something called the Italian-American One Voice Committee, based in Bloomfield, N.J., called Mr. Chase "a 'Pasta-tute,' " which it defined as one "who has sold out his/her Italian culture and heritage in the media or politics or any other notable field." It blamed him for the "wholesale exploitation of Italian-Americans, their culture, heritage and future." This is not an extreme view, either. The National Italian-American Foundation, based in Washington, holds an annual conference at which such entertainment figures as Matt LeBlanc and Mira Sorvino have been honored -- but Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro have not.
One place the battle rages most stridently is on an e-mail discussion group sponsored by an association of otherwise mild-mannered Italian-American academics and historians. Almost daily, angry postings to this open forum fulminate over every new outrage and make the usual calls of victimhood: for boycotts, for petitions, for a general uprising against such defamations. Race treason is not taken lightly here. Once, I picked a fight with a "Soprano"-basher, and in full view of the group's hundreds of members, he called me the worst insult he could think of, under the circumstances: he called me an Uncle Dom.
But look, I wanted to say, every ethnic stereotype is insulting -- otherwise, why bother? And there are even nastier ones out there. How about the Irish, or the poor Poles, to name but two groups bedeviled by unkind, unfair characterizations. Being thought of as a cunning, quite possibly murderous people with a robust skepticism where the rules are concerned isn't the biggest defamation imaginable. It can even come in handy once in a while, believe me.
They hear the insult, but not the envy.
The men on "The Sopranos" do what most men, in their hearts, wish they could do: spend time with one another out and about, idle and unrestrained by the civilizing presence of women in their workplace, free to drink, smoke, curse, eat thick sandwiches of meat and cheese and carry guns and fat rolls of large-denomination bills. They freely commit violence and fornicate, the very things men still do best but are most vigorously denied by contemporary codes of acceptable conduct. Superficially, the women on the show seem beleaguered, but they too yell and curse and rage and hit and smoke and eat lasagna and cannolis, even later at night than nutritionists advise. In fact, the strongest characters on the series are the women: the late Livia, Carmela, Meadow, Janice, even hapless, overeducated Dr. Melfi. The women are fierce in the face of fearsome men.
So, there's a lot to envy. At one extreme: Galileo, Michelangelo, Enrico Fermi, Giorgio Armani, Don DeLillo. At the other: Don Vito Corleone. To middle-class America, as it was to upper-class Victorian England, being Italian is the most fun you can have and still be white. We believe that if you had a choice, you'd be Italian, too. In fact, in her 1990 book, "Ethnic Options: Choosing Identities in America," the sociologist Mary C. Waters described a survey in which she asked people of varied ancestries which ethnic group they'd belong to if they could choose. " 'Italian' was the most common response," she reported. From the outside, we realize, it looks like fun. The passion. The laughter. The food. The relatives. The good hair. True, Tony Soprano's families (both of them) are deeply dysfunctional. But even that doesn't keep them apart: they've found the path we all seek, a way for family members to be alienated and estranged and bitterly at odds but still closely intertwined and unshakably connected. They still show up for dinner.
The Mafia stereotype sticks because Italians are good at turning all their impulses, good or evil, into highly organized, fiercely efficient enterprises. If you have any doubt, consider the Roman Empire, or the Roman Catholic Church or the Giuliani administration. The early gangsters took a motley collection of squalid vices and victimless crimes -- the desire, during Prohibition, for alcohol; gambling and the money-lending required to sustain it; prostitution -- and turned it into an empire. Did they not make a lot of a little? Do you think it was easy to organize all those restless criminal spirits into such a well-oiled, tightly functioning machine? It must have taken extraordinary determination and discipline to make it work as it did. I know what you're thinking: Don't do us any favors! But do you really believe you'd be better off if all that crime, all that outlaw energy, had remained unorganized? Would you be safer walking down the street, or in your bed at night?
The gangster's life gets all the movie and TV attention because it's the most narrative-friendly, charismatic version of our particular cultural capital. This is the homage the rest of America pays to Italian-American magnificence: You've made us mythic. Maybe somewhere there are still adults who identify with the cowboy heroes of yore, but for the most part the public gun duel in the dusty street has been replaced by two stealthy bullets in the back of the head. At last, America is ready to accept itself for what it has been from Day One: the Colombo organized crime family, named for the 15th-century gangster from Genoa who docked hereabouts and began the application of force that got this land good and organized.
OF course, the reality is that Italians have pretty much gotten out of the crime business; we stopped producing good gangsters around the time we stopped producing good middleweights, and for the same socio-economic reasons. Now, when you read an Italian name in the newspapers, it's more likely the president of I.B.M. or Microsoft, or the director of the White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives, than it is some loan shark or corrupt union official. As always, today's most ambitious criminals come from the world's poorest, toughest precincts, notably Russia, if the newspapers can be believed. But none of the relevant parties -- not the screenwriters, not the F.B.I. -- feels comfortable or conversant enough with these alien new gangsters to abandon their beloved Italian racketeers. Nobody's ready to give up on them, not even we who putatively suffer from the stereotypes. Thanks to the movies, the image of the cowboy endured at least a century longer than the cowboys themselves. Our mobsters may never go away.
Think about it: are we ever going to find a name for organized crime better than La Cosa Nostra? It's poetry! It's music! Literally, as you probably know, it translates as "our thing." But what we mean by "our" has become a whole lot bigger than it used to be.

A Cut in Estate Taxes May Not Hurt Insurers

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
FALLING interest rates usually mean higher profits for life insurance companies. That, in turn, tends to push up the price of their shares.
 This time, however, life insurance stocks have been going the other way, down an average of about 10 percent since the beginning of the year, when the Federal Reserve started a new round of rate cuts. Investors appear to be afraid that President Bush will succeed in severely reducing or possibly even abolishing the estate tax, which could hurt sales of life insurance. Many analysts, however, say the market has overreacted to that fear and that now is the time to scoop up life insurance stocks at bargain prices. 
 The estate tax, or "death tax," as Republicans are fond of calling it, is important to life insurers because they have long sold big policies to rich people that largely shield them from it: at death, the insurance proceeds pay the tax bill, leaving the estate intact. This sidestepping of the estate tax, with its rates of up to 55 percent, has become big business.
During his election campaign, Mr. Bush pledged to abolish the tax; he reaffirmed that promise on Tuesday in his address to Congress.
Yet insurance executives and analysts say that sounding the death knell for the estate tax is highly premature. "I think the estate-tax fears are overblown," said Andrew S. Kligerman of Bear Stearns. He recommended that people buy life insurance stocks, saying, "I think they're very undervalued."
For one thing, celebrated wealthy people like Warren Buffett, the Gates family and various Rockefellers have argued against repeal of the estate tax. They and much of the philanthropic world say the tax has prompted charitable donations of money that otherwise would end up in Washington.
Moreover, as tax-reduction legislation moves through Congress, other tax-related changes may be seen as offering greater political benefit than abolishing the estate tax. Those may include the raising of contribution limits on 401(k) plans and other tax-deferred savings programs, as well as the elimination of the so-called marriage penalty. 
According to the Internal Revenue Service, only about 2 percent of the 2.5 million people who died last year had estates worth more than $675,000 -- the floor for the estate tax. Their out-of-pocket expense for insurance to offset the estate tax, one industry executive estimated, was probably about 7 or 8 percent of their tax bills.
Analysts say the estate tax is less likely to be eliminated than modified, probably tailored to ease the burden on business owners and farmers. One possibility is to raise the threshold so that those with holdings of, say, up to $5 million would be exempted. 
In the worst case for the industry, a total repeal of the tax, about 8 percent of new policy sales would be lost, or about $1 billion annually, analysts say. On the other hand, they estimate that the losses could run as low as $250 million a year.
THE impact of any change in the estate tax is blunted, the analysts say, by the industry's heavy move into variable annuities and other retirement products. That has reduced revenue from life insurance to 50 percent or less of total revenue at many companies.
To Michael Frinquelli, a partner atRenaissance Fund Advisers, a hedge fund that buys insurance stocks, some of the life companies appear to be bargains. He has bought additional shares of John Hancock Financial and Lincoln National, both leaders in insurance sales for estate planning, in recent days.
Colin Devine, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, is another bull, recommending Lincoln National, John Hancock, Nationwide Financial Services and Hartford Financial Services.
But Vanessa Wilson of Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown is more cautious. Although she said any changes in the estate tax would be far from devastating to life insurers, she added that the stocks might be more attractive in six months. The signal to buy, she said, would be either if the stocks started moving up or if they "held steady while the rest of the market fell."

Out of the Loop

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; Maureen Dowd is on vacation.

 BODY:
I'm starting to get worried about Alan Greenspan.
 I'm not talking about his role in the tax cut debate -- though the tone at recent Congressional events suggests that few now perceive him as standing above the political fray. What worries me is that he may be getting behind the curve on his proper job, the management of the economy. 
 In his testimony on monetary policy Wednesday, Mr. Greenspan made his trademark argument: technology has changed the ground rules. The key sentence was this: "The same forces that have been boosting growth in structural productivity seem also to have accelerated the pace of cyclical adjustment." Translation: don't worry about the recent plunge in manufacturing -- it's just a matter of nimble firms, reflexes speeded up by information technology, moving quickly to get rid of excess inventories. 
That's probably a correct description of the slowdown so far. But the prospect that a quick recovery will automatically occur once those inventories are back to normal is looking more doubtful by the day.
Indeed, Mr. Greenspan's testimony contained a crucial caveat: "The hastening of the adjustment to emerging imbalances is generally beneficial. . . . But the faster adjustment process does raise some warning flags . . . firms appear to be acting in far closer alignment with one another than in decades past." Translation: firms making investment decisions are starting to emulate the hair-trigger behavior of financial investors. That means a growing part of the economy may be starting to act like a financial market, with all that implies -- like the potential for bubbles and panics. 
One could argue that far from making the economy more stable, the rapid responses of today's corporations make their investment in equipment and software vulnerable to the kind of self-fulfilling pessimism that used to be possible only for investment in paper assets like stocks. And there's a pretty good case to be made that something like that is happening.
Last week, the Oracle Corporation, a leading supplier of business software that was expected to weather any slowdown easily -- surely businesses wouldn't stop investing in technology -- startled the market by suddenly warning of disappointing sales: its customers are postponing orders at the last minute. Oracles are supposed to prophesy the future; and maybe this one has. In the last few weeks there has been a steady drumbeat of stories about businesses abruptly scaling back their investment plans, not because they are already hurting but because the developing climate of fear has convinced managers that it would be prudent to hunker down. And since one company's investment is another company's sales, such retrenchment can bring on the very slump that managers fear. 
Which brings us to the Fed. Usually the Fed moves in a rather stately fashion; the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest rates, meets only about once every six weeks, and moves rates in modest steps. It makes an exception only for financial panics: the Greenspan Fed has been well aware that such panics can turn into self-fulfilling prophecies, and must be countered quickly. 
Right now, seeing no evidence for a classic financial panic, the Fed has resisted calls for another emergency interest-rate cut. It is concerned, rightly, that it not be seen as reacting to every wiggle in the Nasdaq. But what if the new economy can have the functional equivalent of a financial panic, not in the financial markets but in business investment? Then the Fed's determination not to be rushed might turn out to be a big mistake.
Military theorists like to talk about the "OODA loop" -- that's "observe, orient, decide, act." If you can get inside your enemy's loop, reacting more quickly to the changing situation, you win. When it comes to stabilizing the economy, of course, we have met the enemy and he is us -- our own propensity to irrational exuberance and self-fulfilling panic. 
Mr. Greenspan's reputation rests on his success in getting inside the economy's loop in crises past. But thanks to the technological changes he extols, the economy's reactions have gotten faster. It seems like a long time until that next F.O.M.C. meeting.
So has the economy gotten inside Mr. Greenspan's loop? Maybe it's time for him to observe, orient, decide -- and act.

Lobbyists Waitin' on the Levy for Their Ship to Come In

BYLINE:  By JILL ABRAMSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
A NEW president whose road to the White House was paved with hundreds of millions of dollars in corporate donations, the prospect of huge tax cuts and the presence of many comrades in top Bush administration jobs has spread jubilation on K Street, Washington's legendary boulevard of lobbying.
 The celebratory mood, built on the prospect of signing new clients, charging heftier fees, and securing special breaks, was already evident during the inauguration, as lobbying firms and corporations vied to flaunt their ties to the new Bush White House. There was General Motors' gaudy Kennedy Center reception for Andrew H. Card Jr., the White House chief of staff and former G.M. lobbyist. There was Patton Boggs's soiree for Benjamin L. Ginsberg, who argued Bush v. Gore in Florida, the case that gave Mr. Bush the White House. 
 No sooner had President Bush sent his $1.6 trillion tax-cutting plan to Congress last week than lobbyists and trade associations representing everything from software makers to manufacturers of energy-efficient appliances began salivating over their own share of the tax-cut bonanza.
"Lobbying groups and corporations invested a lot in the Bush presidency," said John B. Judis, author of "The Paradox of American Democracy," a book analyzing the growth and power of special interests. "They all now see a payoff with a Bush presidency, with control of the House and Senate and the tax-writing committees."
But when President Bush invited K-Streeters, including the veteran tax lobbyist Charls E. Walker, to the White House for sandwiches and a tete-a-tete in the Cabinet room, his message was hardly music to their ears. "We should focus on people first, not corporations," he said. Then, at his first White House press conference, the president warned that he would "resist the Christmas-tree effect of tax policy. I don't want people putting ornaments on my plan." Lawrence B. Lindsey, Mr. Bush's chief economic adviser, has also been pouring cold water over the tax lobbyists.
But if the Bush tax bill may not be all business lobbyists had hoped for, K-Streeters celebrated Friday over news that Senate Republicans plan to introduce a resolution this week to kill a sweeping ergonomics regulation implemented in the final weeks of the Clinton administration.
Meanwhile, with visions of a tax bill festooned with goodies vanishing, some lobbyists, including Mr. Walker, have hunkered down, watching for their next window of opportunity. Many are hoping the tax cuts will be approved in phases this year, and that the climate for deeper business tax cuts will improve as pressure builds on the Congress, if the economy weakens, and as lawmakers begin to look for campaign donations for the 2002 elections. Others have signed on to help the White House push for Mr. Bush's rate cuts, hoping his advisers, especially Karl Rove, will remember their efforts and respond to future entreaties.
IN another area where lobbyists had hoped for a windfall, military spending, the signals from the new White House have also been mixed. While lobbyists for defense contractors, including Lockheed Martin, were excited about the prospect of building a new missile defense system during a conference at the Ronald Reagan International Trade Center last month, Mr. Bush's order of a top-to-bottom review of military spending makes some nervous.
Longstanding weapons programs might be eliminated, while high-tech companies and others who have not usually enjoyed fat Pentagon contracts could benefit from the administration's new approach.
"The idea that the corporate lobby is some kind of 800-pound gorilla that will get whatever it wants is a myth," said Bruce Bartlett, a senior fellow at the National Center for Policy Analysis. "It's in Bush's interests to stand up to corporate lobbyists." 
Still, many interest groups are gearing up. The Club for Growth, an organization of supply-siders who want an even bigger, $2.1 trillion across-the-board tax cut, is budgeting $1 million for TV ads and a lobbying campaign. During the last election, club members poured at least $100,000 into 15 House races and won 10. According to Stephen Moore, the group's president, the ads may target Republican senators who become tax-cut defectors. Another business coalition is pushing to win more favorable depreciation rules for capital purchases.
"The president is going to have to fight hard to hold to his tax plan and not have it balloon," said former Senator Robert Packwood, who helped steer two major tax bills through the Senate, in 1981 and 1986. Soon Mr. Packwood may be among those crowding into Gucci Gulch, the corridor outside the hearing room of the House Ways and Means Committee, where lobbyists often monitor tax-writing developments. He is representing the American Public Power Association, a coalition of municipal utilities that want special tax relief because of changes brought by deregulation. 
Some veteran lobbyists, including Kenneth J. Kies, the former staff director of the Joint Committee on Taxation and leading lobbyist at PricewaterhouseCoopers, have been pushing for the same tax breaks for years. Mr. Kies has spent much time trying to get changes in the taxation of offshore corporate affiliates. Mr. Walker has waged a decades-long battle to reduce corporate and capital gains taxes and came out of semiretirement to renew the effort this year. Companies pay $15,000 each to join Mr. Walker's Coalition for Jobs Growth and Competitiveness, a pittance if they get even a fraction of what they are seeking.
"These guys get paid even if they lose," said Robert S. McIntyre, the director of Citizens for Tax Justice, which opposes any big tax cut.
SOME observers of the early jockeying on K Street say that's the point. You don't play the lobbying game to win, just to make enough progress so your client renews its retainer. 
"Most of these corporate lobbyists know perfectly well their provisions will get stripped out of any bill," explained Mr. Bartlett, who used to work for Jack F. Kemp, a long-time tax-cutting advocate. "This is all stuff they put on their sheets to show why they deserve their salaries. The perfect provision is one that expires and never gets enacted into law. It allows Congress to milk for contributions. It puts money in everybody's pocket and keeps lobbyists employed."

HEADLINE: Turkey's Economic Troubles 

 BODY:
The calming of Turkey's currency and stock markets last week was encouraging. Ankara's stability is important to Washington, which counts on Turkey as a vital ally in NATO and the Middle East. But the country's second severe financial crisis in barely three months is a warning that should not be ignored. Fixing Turkey's deeper problems will require speeding the pace of economic reform. 
 Before this winter's financial upheavals, Turkey's worst problems seemed behind it. A popular new president, Ahmet Necdet Sezer, was waging an effective campaign against corruption and insisting on the rule of law. The prime minister, Bulent Ecevit, had pledged to carry through badly needed economic reforms. After years of refusals, the European Union had accepted Turkey as a candidate for eventual membership. The country's most wanted rebel, the Kurdish guerrilla commander Abdullah Ocalan, was behind bars and calling on his followers to lay down their arms. 
 Some of those gains have now been put at risk. When the latest financial crisis erupted, Turkey was in the 14th month of an anti-inflation and privatization program sponsored by the International Monetary Fund. The Ecevit government made progress in both areas but fell short of the fund's targets. Now, with Turkey's currency sharply devalued, the I.M.F. program has been abandoned and international creditors are reluctant to offer a new bailout.
Mr. Ecevit depends on a three-party coalition to stay in power. Some of his partners are nationalists who oppose privatization in principle and are determined to obstruct any reduction in the number of patronage jobs in state industry and government-chartered banks. Bank charters are typically awarded to big campaign contributors. As a result, many banks are mismanaged and in shaky financial health. 
Last month's financial panic began when Mr. Ecevit unwisely rejected criticism from President Sezer over the government's slowness in tackling corruption, especially in the banking sector. Mr. Ecevit should have allied himself with Mr. Sezer instead of quarreling with him. Mr. Ecevit now needs to press his coalition partners to set aside narrow interests and help Turkey carry out the economic modernization it needs to join the European Union. The naming of a longtime World Bank executive on Friday as the economy minister is a positive first step.
To qualify for E.U. membership, Turkey will also have to improve its human rights record, especially its treatment of the Kurdish minority. With the end of Mr. Ocalan's armed insurgency, Ankara should be moving faster to relax restrictions on Kurdish political and cultural expression.
Ankara defended NATO's easternmost frontier against the Soviet Union during the cold war. Since then, it has borne much of the burden of containing Saddam Hussein's Iraq and has developed constructive military relations with Israel. Bringing Turkey into the E.U. would strengthen Western influence in Turkey and dilute anti-Muslim prejudice in Europe. But Turkey's candidacy will stall unless the country rescues its economy from endemic corruption and crisis.

HEADLINE: The World: A Sorry Mess; 
Taking the Measure of Suffering

BYLINE:  By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
PRESIDENT BUSH dispatched a special envoy, a Navy admiral, to Japan last week to make another in an extraordinary string of apologies for the sinking of a fishing school boat off Hawaii by an American submarine early last month. And yet feelings on both sides of the Pacific remain as ruffled by the fuss over making amends as over the accident itself. 
 From the Americans, the first regrets may have come from a high level, but those directly responsible remained silent. After it was clear the Japanese were infuriated, there were phone calls to Japan by President Bush, visits with family members by Ambassador Thomas S. Foley and many other gestures. Rarely has Washington apologized at so many levels for an accident involving the armed forces. 
 But relatives of the nine people still missing from the accident and Japan's government and media complain bitterly that the Americans have shown bad form, and possibly bad faith, in explaining the accident and atoning for the loss of life. Some called for the captain of the submarine, Cmdr. Scott D. Waddle, to apologize even after he sent a letter to Japan's national television network, an effort some called insufficient, insincere and indirect. He finally had his apology accepted -- by showing up at the Japanese consulate in Honolulu with letters for the victims' families, and bowing and weeping before a ranking Japanese official. 
The nations' painful pas de deux is easily seen as a cautionary illustration of how cultural misunderstandings can separate even allies as close as the United States and Japan. The accident's aftermath may be unnecessarily painful simply because, from subtle gradations of bowing to the elaborate calendar of shrine visits and offerings that Japanese use to expiate guilt, apologizing is woven into Japan's politics and psyche in a way that remains foreign to America. 
But the incident, examined more closely, reveals a range of Japanese, not American, problems, from deepening post-cold war malaise and smoldering resentments of American success to the country's own hypocrisy in coming to terms with its Asian neighbors.
Richard Cohen, a columnist for The Washington Post, touched this nerve when he wrote that Japan's attitude smacked of "epic hypocrisy" because of Japan's much belated, and for its neighbors still dubious, apologies for the atrocities committed by the Imperial Army in Asia during World War II. 
By coincidence, the column appeared on Thursday, while the Japanese government was under attack by both China and South Korea for plans to approve new textbooks that describe the war not as a vicious imperial conquest, but instead, in a chilling revival of Japan's wartime propaganda, as a benevolent effort to create a "Greater East Asian War of the Co-Prosperity Sphere." Also last week, a lawsuit was brought against two Japanese conglomerates in a Los Angeles court seeking damages for Koreans forced into wartime slave labor.
But the column drew an indignant reply from Japan's ambassador to Washington, Shunji Yanai, who said that Mr. Cohen was not "entitled" to speak about Japan's past.
Recrimination over apologies has been a constant feature of relations between Japan and its East Asian neighbors for decades. The display of raw feelings between Japan and the United States has been much rarer. But now, latent Japanese resentment toward the United States in many areas have come to the fore. Most notably, Okinawa's governor acted on his region's increasing anger over the huge American military presence -- fueled by a history of crimes committed by troops -- and demanded that Tokyo negotiate a reduction.
Some Americans, resentful of Japan's complaints about the apology, see manipulation. "They are trying to build up leverage for something, politically and psychologically, for negotiations with the United States," said Ivan P. Hall, author of "Cartels of the Mind" (Norton, 1997), an exploration of Japanese protectionism. "It may be on trade issues, it may be on the bases, it may be on something else. They are abusing a tragedy." 
IN a similarly ominous vein, some Japanese say the accident was planned. "There were suggestions in some magazines that this was somehow deliberate," said Yoshikuni Igarashi, a historian at Vanderbilt University and the author of "Bodies of Memory" (Princeton University Press, 2000), an examination of World War II on Japanese culture. "It is difficult to know what to make of this except that the accident is not just about the nine lives that were lost. It has become symbolic of the relationship between the two countries." 
Patrick Smith, an analyst of Japanese affairs, said: "There is a restlessness under the surface of the relationship. The accident was a very regrettable thing, but it didn't put the restlessness there. It was the eruption that let it come through the surface. You see it in the things that people are looking for from the U.S., and most importantly, they are looking for justice. 
"Justice comes from equality in the relationship. And that is the rub here." 
In the first days after the accident, Japanese anger was directed mostly at the country's prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, who brushed off news of the sinking and continued playing golf, saying later: "Why is this an issue of emergency management? It is an accident, isn't it? I think I exercised my leadership." 
But Mr. Mori, whose popularity has sunk into the single digits, is merely the least impressive of a string of failed prime ministers. Most have simply worked to forestall change while Japan's problems accumulated, from repeated recession and shrinking population to rampant bankruptcies and exploding public debt. Many Japanese people feel their country is doomed to decline.
"The American government gave the best possible response," said Makoto Iokibe, a historian at Kobe University specializing in relations between the United States and Japanese. "But when one's psyche is injured, you can only give attention to one side of a problem."

HEADLINE: Iraqis Who Look Back in Anguish 

BYLINE:  By JOHN F. BURNS 

DATELINE: SAFWAN, Iraq, Feb. 28 

 BODY:
Most days, Hamza Jabbar comes to this silent, deserted border crossing to sit, and remember. From where he rests, on a concrete plinth bearing a benign portrait of Saddam Hussein, he can see across a rusting barrier to abandoned customs sheds and down a heavily potholed road that leads to Kuwait.
 For Mr. Jabbar, the hours spent alone here, hands resting on a walking stick, are filled with unquenchable regret. Down the road, 85 miles away, lies Kuwait City, where for 37 years he was one of thousands of Iraqis with solid salaried jobs -- in Mr. Jabbar's case as a $750-a-month storeman in Kuwait's Education Ministry. He had a home and a lifestyle that were better than anything he could have hoped for in Iraq. 
 That life is gone now, along with the pension that Mr. Jabbar, who is 67, hoped would sustain his retirement. On Aug. 2, 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait; on Feb. 27, 1991, the Iraqi occupation force fled headlong, pursued by the military might of a 33-nation alliance. Afterward, all Iraqi citizens were ordered out by Kuwait's restored rulers. 
Under the United Nations economic sanctions adopted after Iraq's invasion, and reinforced after the war, Iraq was cut off from all normal commerce with surrounding states. Here at the Safwan border post, where thousands of cars and trucks once crossed daily, vehicles from the United Nations force that monitors a nine-mile-wide demilitarized zone straddling the border have been the only traffic for 10 years.
Where Mr. Jabbar sits, there is little but stillness, and a solitude that gives him the time to juggle his painful memories and sometimes, he admitted, to weep.
Asked what solace he found in his vigils, the old storeman, squinting from beneath his Arab headdress in the noonday sun, pondered for some time, then spoke finally, in a quavering voice. "I come here when I am upset," he said. "I had a good life there, in Kuwait, for many, many years, then one day I looked up" -- he raised his arms skyward -- "and suddenly, everything was gone -- my job, my house, my pension, even my son. I lost everything, only because I was an Iraqi."
His 21-year-old son, Ahmed, he said, was shot dead by Kuwaitis amid the wave of recriminations that accompanied the Iraqi withdrawal as he tried to retrieve the family car and drive it home. At the time, thousands of Iraqis were trying to escape with cars they had looted.
In the United States, and other countries, the victory over the Iraqis 10 years ago is remembered, mainly, as a moment of decency restored, and six months of brutality and pillage by Iraqi troops ended.
But the war is viewed through quite another prism in Iraq, and not only in the proud pronouncements that have accompanied Iraq's official commemorations of what Saddam Hussein called "the mother of all battles," and the veiled hints, from senior Iraqi officials, that if they had the chance they might try to take Kuwait again.
The Baghdad government has used the occasion to weave the Kuwait invasion ever more firmly into the hagiography, pronouncing the day of the Iraqi attack "a joyous moment in the history of the Arab peoples' struggle" and pledging, in the "immortal memory" of the estimated 20,000 to 50,000 Iraqi troops who died, that Iraq will never forsake the "road taken" in 1990. Officials in Mr. Hussein's inner circle have indicated that they have nothing to regret.
And then there are the bitter reminiscences of ordinary Iraqis. For the war itself, they paid heavily -- as soldiers who suffered injuries and sicknesses attributed to allied bombing, and relatives of people killed in the fighting or when American or allied bombs went astray.
Beyond all this, there are the privations endured by all but the most privileged of the 23 million Iraqis. Surveys by the United Nations, and estimates by Iraqi economists, have put the shrinkage in Iraq's economy under the impact of the war and sanctions at anything between 20 and 50 percent; inflation in the 1990's devalued the local currency, the dinar, by more than 5,000 percent. 
As they guide foreign journalists around the country, monitoring every conversation and every photograph, and stepping in abruptly to halt anything they deem potentially injurious, Information Ministry officials lay heavy emphasis on the human suffering. In a country that has never officially conceded defeat, the concern to lay the blame for this suffering on the United States prompts these officials, sometimes, to lead what amount to guided tours of Iraqi troops' humiliation.
One such place is Jabal Sanam, a rocky hill a few miles southwest of Safwan, where, Iraq says, American aircraft attacked a unit of the Iraqi Army's Soviet-built T-62 tanks on the night of Feb. 26 to 27, 1991.
From what is visible now, the American planes struck every tank with such force that they remain, a decade later, where they were hit, their rusting hulks resting deep in gullies, their turrets blown 150 feet or more away, and the burned-out seats for their four-man crews covered with what appear to be human ashes.
A mile north of Safwan, by a highway interchange, is the spot where American and Iraqi generals met in an American tent to sign a cease-fire agreement. But Jabal Sanam is more central to a new Iraqi thrust against the United States.
The Iraqi contention, vigorously contested by the Pentagon, is that the use of depleted uranium warheads on tank-busting missiles, and other bombs and rockets, led to thousands of cases of leukemia, lymphoma and other cancers. Similar charges have been made by groups representing gulf war veterans in the United States and Europe, but officially commissioned British and American studies have reported no evidence that the incidence of cancer is higher than in the general population.
At Jabal Sanam, Iraqi officials behave with self-conscious unease, as though to press home the allegations about depleted uranium. Empty oil barrels painted in the United Nations colors of blue and white carry hand-painted warnings in English, "Bomblet Area," denoting that cluster bombs were used in the American attack, and not cleared. One bomblet was visible only feet from the road leading up the hill to a blasted tank.
While two Westerners walked cautiously over the tanks to inspect and photograph them, the officials lingered nearby smoking, occasionally calling out to drive home their point about high levels of radiation allegedly detected here. 
"It is not good to stay here too long," said one. "Radiation here is very high. Many people in Safwan have blood cancer from this place."
Getting closer to the truth of the allegations is difficult, even after visiting supposed victims in Safwan and Basra, the oil city 35 miles north of Safwan that underwent heavy American air attacks. Visits to two sufferers -- a 9-year-old boy in Safwan with a mass of suppurating scars on his face that doctors said remain undiagnosed and a 28-year-old war infantry veteran who developed lymphoma in 1996 -- produced wrenching personal stories, but little to link the cases to the war.
Perhaps most striking, considering the ceaseless government polemics against the United States, few ordinary Iraqis seem inclined to engage in political recriminations over the causes of the war, or over the heavy American bombing.
Few of those interviewed had anything harsh to say about the American decision to reverse the Kuwait invasion, and only a handful, mostly former officers or officials, seemed ready to depict the conflict as an occasion of glory for Iraq.
Umran Abid Ali, the lymphoma victim, who met visitors in a Basra house shared with 13 relatives, described how he survived an air attack on a retreating column on the night of Feb. 26 by jumping off the tank when he heard approaching aircraft. "When I saw that all the vehicles in the column had been destroyed, I was afraid," he said, describing the fireball that consumed tanks, trucks and cars. "I heard some soldiers who were trapped in their vehicles crying out for help, and then everything went quiet."
For years, Iraq described the battering of retreating columns as war crimes, but Mr. Ali talked as though the attack was to be expected in war. Like many other veterans, he focused his indignation on the economic sanctions; all 14 members of his family, he said, live off one salary, that of his brother Ahmed, who said he makes about $8 a month as a trader in Basra's bazaars.
After a tour of the gulf region this week, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said he would recommend that Washington revamp the sanctions -- for which support has frayed among Arab nations and even European allies -- to reinforce elements intended to hinder an Iraqi arms buildup, while easing suffering.
General Powell said Arab allies reported that the sanctions have had the effect of strengthening Saddam Hussein. This observation is supported by United Nations reports and complaints by some intrepid Iraqis, who contend that the government has diverted some of the $10 billion of food and medicines bought with carefully monitored oil revenues to regime loyalists, fostering an artificial crisis among the less fortunate.
Disabled veterans get a pension, equivalent to about $4 a month, enough for three cartons of eggs. But others, including Mr. Ali, said they had received no government money at all. Baghdad and Basra are filled with veterans on sidewalks selling off pitiful remains of their households -- old plumbing parts, ancient steam irons, old vinyl records.
Perhaps because his cancer is advanced, perhaps out of weariness at the parade of reporters brought to see him, Mr. Ali responded to a question about what he would say to Saddam Hussein with a directness that was startling, considering the common habit of lauding the Iraqi ruler whenever his name comes up. "If I met His Excellency, I would tell him, 'Please, bring us good doctors and medicines and food,' " he said. "I wouldn't tell him, 'Make war on America, they did bad things to Iraq' -- no, no. I would only say, bring us the best doctors, bring us the best medicines, and bring us food."

HEADLINE: AUTO RACING; 
The Crossing of Faith and Big-Time Sport

BYLINE:  By ROBERT LIPSYTE 

 BODY:
The current beatification of Dale Earnhardt as a man's man who sacrificed himself to shepherd his flock to the finish line, a hero who in death evoked both John Wayne and Jesus, has presented America with its biggest jolt of sports and evangelical Christianity since Billy Sunday left the Chicago outfield a century ago to become a superstar preacher. But it should not be a surprise.
 "In many ways, evangelical Christianity and big-time sport are similar," says Prof. William J. Baker, an expert on both. "Both are win-loss mentalities. In evangelical Christianity you are either saved or lost. You've gone to Heaven or you've gone to hell. You win or you lose, and that's what sport is all about." 
 Stock car racing, born on the red clay of the Bible belt, may be the major sport that institutionally most encourages religious practice. Physical danger lurks in the corners, as does instant economic disaster. The uneasy mixes of man and machine, individual heroics and teamwork, ego and corporate sponsors, endless travel and young families, create a roiling sea of stress.
Talking to the chaplain is far more acceptable in this culture than talking to a psychotherapist. And don't forget the need for forgiveness -- bumping a rival out of your way as well as cheating on technical specifications are common practices, only recently frowned on.
The sport's most celebrated active star, Jeff Gordon, says: "There is a fine line in our sport between trying to do the right thing and trying to do the competitive thing that puts you over the top to win. We've had a lot of conversations in our Bible studies about that. God wants us to do all of what we know in our abilities to win the race, but we all know in the back of our minds what wins a race in a way that you'll feel proud and what wins a race in a way that you're not very proud of."
Gordon, Darrell Waltrip, Dale Jarrett and Joe Gibbs have been stalwarts in Motor Racing Outreach, a 13-year-old program whose circuit-riding preachers provide scheduled trackside services as well as grief counseling. Two M.R.O. clergymen, Max Helton, a founder of the group, and Dale Beaver, reached national television audiences last month at the memorial service for Earnhardt. Along with ministering to NascarNation, M.R.O.'s goal has been to reach that national audience.
"God is using people in these higher-profile positions, whether they are the drivers of these race cars or the men that make it happen," Beaver said. "God is using them to remind people, 'I'm still here, I'm not silent and I still care about you.' "
Gordon said: "I think I've been put on a platform to show other people what God has done for me in my life. I think God wants all of us to spread that word and be able to influence others, so they can live a better life."
The above quotations are all five months old, gathered with the producer Lou Charlip for a PBS show, "Religion & Ethics Newsweekly." Despite their willingness to discuss their religiosity when asked, stock car drivers tend to be less publicly ostentatious in their expressions of faith than many baseball and football players.
They are certainly more restrained than Sunday, who admitted to having prayed for a divine push while chasing fly balls. But as did Sunday, the drivers bring the grit and sweat of the arena to the pulpit, a 19th-century ideal of muscular Christianity. In his time, Sunday's fans credited him with restoring the masculine aura of Christ and of rescuing religion from women and effete clergymen.
But it wasn't until the 1970's, with the rise of groups like the Fellowship of Christian Athletes and the Baseball Chapel, that evangelical Christianity once again became a strong presence in big-time sports. (Coincidentally or not, this was at a time when the world's most famous athlete, Muhammad Ali, had abandoned Christianity for Islam.) In some locker rooms, the splits between blacks and whites, and between boozers and dopers were overshadowed by the schism between so-called God Squaders and the Unsaved. Ballplayers who felt oppressed by the born-agains questioned their commitment to winning and snickered when they were arrested on vice charges.
Outside stock car racing, this is still a hot issue. The flip side of joyously thanking Jesus on television for a touchdown is muttering, "It was God's will" when a kick sails wide and the game is lost. Is religion, like drugs and performance-
enhancement therapy, yet another way for athletes to find an edge? And what about Carolina Panther Reggie White, the so-called minister of defense, an ordained clergyman who has never been officially censored by the National Football League for offensive remarks about gays?
As president of the Texas Rangers, George W. Bush encouraged what was the epicenter of right-thinking locker-room religion. When Joe Gibbs was the Washington Redskins' spectacularly successful coach, he says he "never not hired somebody, kept somebody on a football team -- I've never even asked that question -- but if you ask me personally are we better performers for knowing we have a personal relationship with Christ, I think I am."
Now a spectacularly successful Winston Cup team owner, Gibbs told me last September before a race in Richmond: "I think God makes everything about everything. Does he have a hand in everything? I think he has a hand in the outcome."
Stock car racers tend to be wary of sharing faith with the more expressive baseball and football players, many of whom, the racers say, are praying to "trinket Gods, false Gods," to bring them better luck. Professor Baker, who grew up in northern Georgia, was the "passing preacher" as a quarterback at Furman and now teaches history at the University of Maine, detects racism in this -- stock car racing is overwhelmingly white.
But Baker, author of the forthcoming "Playing With God," a study of religion and sport, is convinced of the logic and the sincerity of the response to Earnhardt's death.
"When good old boys say Dale's in a better place now, they mean it," Baker said last week. "You go to Heaven because you believe in Jesus, not by your good works. You can live your life like a dog, but be saved at the end. And that's like sport, too. You can win on the last lap."

The Series So Far
 This is the seventh article in a series following auto racing, its safety, its sense of family and its popularity. Previous articles were about the sport's appeal to a crossover audience, the search for the sport's Tiger Woods, a veteran driver's view and how the sport's insiders deal with death on the track.

HEADLINE: Gipper Meets 'Survivor' As G.E.'s Image Hardens; 
PCB Battle Tests a Venerable Tradition

BYLINE:  By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
One of the more upbeat theories of postmodern capitalism is that nice companies will eventually finish first. In a market of instant information, where perception and image are increasingly linked to stock prices, investors will reward the environmentally green and the socially conscious because such companies have fewer potential liabilities, or so the thinking goes.
 But the nice-guy theory is getting a major test in upstate New York, where General Electric is waging a vehement, line-in-the-sand battle against dredging the Hudson River to remove the PCB's that its factories leaked or dumped into the water in the decades after World War II. 
 Environmentalists, economists and stock market experts say that as the company has poured tens of millions of dollars into a campaign of television infomercials, billboards and lobbying over the last year, an argument about the future of the river has increasingly mutated into an argument about G.E. itself. The messenger has become the message. Whether the federal Environmental Protection Agency's proposed $460 million dredging plan to remove the river's pollution at G.E.'s expense is the right scientific answer has become a battle instead over which side to trust. 
And that in turn presents a whole series of questions, not only for the local residents who are being bombarded with sound-bites about E.P.A. high-handedness and river hydrology, but for the legions of investors who for years on end have worshiped the company and its chief executive, John F. Welch Jr. Last month, G.E. was declared the most admired corporation in the world for the fourth year in a row by Fortune magazine.
Is there a point at which G.E.'s Hudson strategy backfires and becomes an environmental liability? Is G.E.'s dismissive tone about the federal government a mark of arrogance, as critics suggest, or the righteousness of a just cause in the face of a dictatorial federal bureaucracy, as company officials claim? 
Perhaps most crucially, what does the campaign say about its intended audience? What, in the end, do Americans really admire -- the stand-up citizen who admits responsibility and takes a poke in the eye, or the win-at-any-cost competitor? Do people want the most decent person in the Australian outback to win a million dollars, or the most cunning?
Some experts on corporate behavior and the environment say the most revealing thing about the Hudson-G.E. fight is that it could occur at all.
"It's a testament to how much times have changed that a company can even float a campaign like this," said Andrew J. Hoffman, a professor of management at Boston University who has studied the frontier of business and the environment. In the early days of environmental regulation, Professor Hoffman said, corporate public relations efforts mostly focused on damage control -- like Exxon's strategy after the Valdez oil spill or Union Carbide's after the chemical disaster in Bhopal, India.
A proactive campaign like G.E.'s, charging that the environmental regulators are simply wrong, incompetent or politically motivated, shows not only how much more complex environmental issues have become, he said, but also how much the power bases have shifted. Fewer people believe the government has all the answers, and corporations have charged in to fill the gap.
General Electric used polychlorinated biphenyls for nearly three decades at two factories in the towns of Hudson Falls and Fort Edward. An estimated 1.3 million pounds of PCB's, oily chemicals that were later linked to cancer in humans and various problems in wildlife, leaked or were discharged into the river. Most of it is gone, E.P.A. officials say -- absorbed into the tissues of fish, animals and people, or washed out to sea. The government's plan, announced in December, would try to recover about 100,000 pounds of PCB's from the most polluted hot spots along a 40-mile stretch north of Albany. 
The company's counterattack to dredging -- on which it has spent by some estimates $60 million or more over the last year in the Albany media market alone -- is stark and stylistically striking. The G.E. spokesmen are invariably tieless and looking relaxed, often before an inviting river backdrop. Everyone looks windblown and outdoorsy -- at home in the natural world. 
Film clips of E.P.A. officials, by contrast, especially the former administrator, Carol M. Browner, show her standing awkwardly at a lectern, with the clear suggestion that she is a woman of the indoors -- or worse, a Washington insider. Harsh, metallic background music that sounds like something from the movie "Hannibal" surges up whenever a clip is shown of an E.P.A. dredging site. Even city buses in Albany now carry anti-dredging billboards. 
General Electric's vice president for corporate communications, Beth Comstock, said that G.E.'s strategy was simply to educate. The company's scientific inquiries have shown the E.P.A.'s dredging plan to be ill conceived and potentially disastrous for the Hudson's ecosystem and the local economy, Ms. Comstock said, and G.E. has an obligation to make sure residents are informed of that. Under the E.P.A.'s rules, the government must consider local opinion in the area of any proposed environmental remediation -- a comment period that in the Hudson case runs through mid-April.
The fight is not about saving the company half a billion dollars, Ms. Comstock said. "The easiest thing in the world would be for G.E. to write a check, but that's not what this is about; it's about finding the right answer for the river. People admire G.E. because we're willing to fight for what we believe in."
Stock market analysts say that for now G.E. seems to be suffering not at all for its defiance.
"Those appreciative of G.E. tend to be appreciative of Jack Welch's hard-charging style," said James N. Kelleher, a senior analyst at Argus Research in New York. "G.E.'s aggressive brand of capitalism and unwillingness to kowtow to environmentalists may not be winning them any enemies in the investment community, and may be winning them some adherents."
But there are also some subtle indications that what had been a kind of fire wall within G.E.'s image -- investors cheering on one side, environmentalists booing on the other -- may be eroding a little. Last year, a resolution put to the company's shareholders by a coalition of religious groups asking G.E. to give a full report of how much it was spending on media and lobbying drew more than 8 percent of all votes cast. That was nearly three times the number needed to keep the resolution alive for presentation a second year. And in February, a column in Fortune magazine -- in the same issue crowning the company as most admired -- forcefully called on G.E. to "just do it," and announce a cleanup of the river.
Sociologists and other researchers who study corporate behavior say that G.E. has long been a mirror for American society, because so much of its culture has been bound up in the presentation and cultivation of its own image. In the 1950's, for example, when Ronald Reagan became G.E.'s front man and "General Electric Theater" was the company's national television platform, G.E. was paternal and competent, an unflappable commander just back from the war, said Peter D. Kinder, the president of Kinder, Lydenberg, Domini & Company, a Boston-based firm that does social research for institutional investors. But beginning in the 1980's and 1990's, he added, a different ethos emerged in America, and at General Electric.
"Now they're tough in all the areas it's fashionable to be tough in," Mr. Kinder said. And while he stressed that G.E. failed most of his tests to qualify as a socially responsible investment, he confessed to a certain admiration for its "They're brilliant," he said.
Some experts on science and economics say that part of the backdrop of G.E.'s fight is that environmentalism itself has changed. The anti-establishment, anti-business youth culture groups that put together the first Earth Day in 1970 have in many cases become powerful and well-financed environmental lobbying organizations. Many corporations, meanwhile, have seen that environmentalism can be good for business, and have actively marketed themselves as ecologically correct pillars of hardheaded real world expertise.
Instead of passively embracing the values of environmentalism, some business researchers say, companies are redefining what it means to be green at all. In the same way that many once-radical environmentalists of the street were tamed, so too were anti-environmentalists of the boardroom.
What has not changed, at least at the E.P.A., is the idea that rational science will carry the day. The agency's mission on the Hudson, a spokeswoman said, is not to manipulate public opinion, or use emotion on the river's behalf, but rather to put forward the best evidence available and trust in the intelligence of the public.
"We are not out there to sell this like a can of soup," said Ann C. Rychlenski, a spokeswoman for the agency.

Why Is He on Top? He's a Tyson, for One

BYLINE:  By DAVID BARBOZA 

DATELINE: SPRINGDALE, Ark. 

 BODY:
JOHN H. TYSON may be this state's latest comeback kid.
 Just over a decade ago, while he was addicted to drugs and alcohol, he was named to the board of Tyson Foods, the giant poultry company that his grandfather founded in 1935. He was also a lobbyist for Tyson, calling upon some of the most powerful politicians in the land, though for three years, he said, he had a "nonexistent" relationship with his father, Donald J. Tyson, who was then the company's chairman and chief executive. 
 Then, in the mid-1990's, when he was president of Tyson's beef and pork division, John Tyson became caught up in a political scandal; it culminated four years ago, when he was named an unindicted co-conspirator in a special prosecutor's case against the former agriculture secretary, Mike Espy, who was accused, but ultimately acquitted, of illegally accepting gifts and favors from Tyson and other big corporations.
Despite that unusual resume, John Tyson is now the chairman and chief executive of Tyson Foods, the nation's biggest chicken processor. He is also the force behind Tyson's decision early this year to acquire IBP, the world's largest beef processor, for about $3.2 billion, in a merger that would make Tyson the nation's No. 1 processor of beef and chicken and the second-biggest processor of pork. 
That Mr. Tyson got to the top, despite abusing drugs and sometimes acting cavalierly on the job, illustrates just how much power the Tyson family retains in what is, after all, a public company. Family members own less than a majority of the outstanding shares, yet they control 90 percent of its votes. 
Some big investors have criticized the company because of that dual-class stock structure and because its board is made up largely of insiders. But few have publicly opposed the appointment of Mr. Tyson, 47, who says he stopped abusing drugs and alcohol in 1990.
And Don Tyson said he had no doubts about his son, who became chief executive last April. "Within the past years, he's stepped forward and proven himself a serious business person," Mr. Tyson said in a statement. "I am really proud of what he's done since assuming the role of chairman in 1998. The way our company has operated in the face of very difficult circumstances in our industry is a testament to John and his entire management team."
But as John Tyson takes over, the company is facing some of its stiffest challenges in decades, from slumping chicken prices and eroding profit growth to recurring questions about his company's labor and environmental practices.
There is also growing skepticism about whether it can successfully merge its operations with those of IBP, and even uncertainty about whether it can complete the deal. For one thing, the merger is being delayed by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is looking into accounting irregularities at a unit of IBP.
But perhaps the biggest challenge facing Mr. Tyson -- whom employees at the headquarters here still call Johnny -- will be to convince investors and skeptics that he can run what would be the nation's biggest meat company, a $23 billion enterprise.
For his part, Mr. Tyson appears to be moving fast to put his stamp on a company that is shifting course after more than two decades of spectacular growth. In less than a year, he has restructured the company's operations, reshuffled top management and then, in one bold move, snatched IBP from the clutches of Smithfield Foods, the nation's biggest pork producer and processor, after a fierce bidding war.
Mr. Tyson is confidently, even aggressively, pursuing his own course, though his father, Don Tyson, 70, is still involved with the company's big decisions. If the son succeeds, Tyson will be processing nearly one-quarter of all meat sold in the United States and will become the nation's third-largest packaged-food company, behind Philip Morris's Kraft Foods division and Conagra.
In an interview in his office, which his father adorned with chicken and egg motifs, Mr. Tyson spoke candidly about his drug and alcohol abuse and his seemingly unlikely comeback. But he scoffed at the suggestion that he was not qualified for the top job. "If I wasn't qualified, I wouldn't have this job," he snapped.
Chief among those qualifications, of course, was being the only son of Don Tyson, the flamboyant and politically powerful head of Tyson Foods from 1967 to 1995. John Tyson says that was not his only virtue.
He was an excellent student at Springdale High School, where he was on the student council and participated in basketball, golf, gymnastics and track, he said. Though he attended three colleges as an undergraduate -- the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville, the University of Southern California in Los Angeles and Southern Methodist University in Dallas -- his grades were solid.
It was in college that he began to drift. He lost faith in God and began to drink heavily and to experiment with drugs, he said. "I didn't stay on the path," he said, referring to his Presbyterian and Methodist upbringing. "I was wandering around."
Still, in 1975, he graduated from S.M.U. with a business degree, then spent a year at the University of Arkansas law school before dropping out. He later said he had decided that lawyers were paid to give opinions while he wanted to make decisions.

Law School to Hog Farm
He would get that chance at Tyson Foods. In the 1970's, the company was blossoming into a chicken giant, acquiring big competitors and perfecting an efficient factory-like farm system that now processes close to two billion chickens a year.
Shortly after law school, he recalled, he traveled to New York with his father to meet a man who was selling a hog operation to Tyson. It was one of the company's earliest efforts to diversify. He was sent to North Carolina to manage one of Tyson's small hog operations.
In the late 1970's and early 80's, he worked in a variety of jobs at Tyson, but as late as 1989, few people expected him to succeed his father as chairman and chief executive.
Marvin Schwartz, who was writing a book about Tyson Foods at the time, said John Tyson was not a serious contender for the top jobs. When he asked about interviewing John Tyson for his book, he said, Don Tyson's answer was: Don't bother.
And when Mr. Schwartz proposed having father and son pose in front of a portrait of John W. Tyson, the company's founder, for the book's cover photograph, Don Tyson again discouraged the idea. "I asked Don, and he didn't think there was any use in that," Mr. Schwartz recalled. Don Tyson posed alone.
The reasoning, one Tyson executive said, was simple: John Tyson, at the time, was thoroughly messed up. From 1984, when he joined Tyson's board, to 1990, he was addicted to cocaine and alcohol. His friends knew it, his family knew it and, apparently, so did the company.
"I can tell you the only reason I was on the payroll is because I was the son of the boss," John Tyson testified at a 1998 court trial that grew out of the Espy case. "Any other corporation, I would have been thrown to the wolves."
For the better part of six years, he was lost. "Everything was foggy," particularly his work at Tyson, he said, and he became "a renegade." That included wearing a ponytail that he liked to flop over his shoulder, just to get attention.
He got married around that time, but his friends say that his behavior was erratic and that he occasionally appeared depressed. In social gatherings, he often showed clear signs of being under the influence.
"There were times when it was extremely noticeable," said Woody Bassett, a lawyer who has known John Tyson since childhood. "If he didn't handle this, I'm not sure he'd be here today."
Even Wall Street analysts noticed the problems in the 1980's, when Mr. Tyson appeared at conferences or social functions with other company executives. "He showed up boozed at one of the meetings," said an analyst who asked not to be identified. "He had lost a lot of weight."
Friends say Mr. Tyson's drug and alcohol problems ended shortly after a trip they took with him to Dallas, where they visited Butch Davis, a childhood friend who was an assistant coach of the Dallas Cowboys.
During that weekend, Mr. Tyson seemed depressed, they say. At the end of the trip, Mr. Tyson returned home and sought treatment. He said he received "private help" and also went to Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous -- a decade later, he still attends meetings regularly -- and undertook the A.A. 12-step program.
He said he had his last drink in November 1990. "I count my birth date as December 1, 1990," he once said. "Since then, I've been headed in the right direction."

Recovery and Rise to Power
Mr. Tyson also tried to rehabilitate his professional life. He says his relationship with his father improved, and so did his career prospects. In 1990, he was a vice chairman at the company, but with very few responsibilities. Within three years, he rose to president of the beef and pork division -- just as the small unit began to lose sales. He later headed the international division just before it faltered with the collapse of the Russian economy in 1998.
Wall Street analysts say he failed to distinguish himself in either position. But they also say he received some of the toughest assignments.
"One could argue he's never been given the best hand to play," said John McMillin, an analyst at Prudential Securities. "But I don't think he did much with the cards he had."
Then came the political scandal. In 1994, a special prosecutor began investigating Mr. Espy, who resigned amid suspicions that he had accepted gifts, lodging and other favors worth thousands of dollars from people and companies he was supposed to be regulating. Tyson Foods topped the gratuity list.
Tyson Foods pleaded guilty to making illegal gifts and agreed to pay $6 million in 1997 for illegally funneling $12,000 worth of gifts to Mr. Espy in 1993 and 1994, when the agriculture department was mulling costly safety labeling regulations.
John Tyson figured in nearly all the transactions. He met privately with Mr. Espy, accompanied him to a Dallas Cowboys football game, and helped Mr. Espy's girlfriend, Patricia Dempsey, obtain a $1,200 scholarship from the Tyson Foundation. Tyson Foods also paid $2,556 for Mr. Espy and Ms. Dempsey to travel to Arkansas for a 1994 weekend gala to celebrate the birthdays of John Tyson and Don Tyson's girlfriend, who were both turning 40.
In exchange for their cooperation, Don and John Tyson were granted immunity from prosecution. Still, they were named as unindicted co-conspirators in a case that eventually led to prison sentences for Tyson's communications director, Archibald R. Schaffer 3rd, and its Washington lobbyist, Jack L. Williams. (Both men were pardoned in January by President Clinton.)
A jury acquitted Mr. Espy of all charges in December 1998.
John Tyson says the Espy case was just part of a political witch hunt that had more to do with President Clinton than with Tyson Foods.
The company said that all it gave Mr. Espy was an "act of common hospitality." 
Mr. Tyson said, "We became a political football, and when you're a football it doesn't matter which side you're on, they're going to kick you." 
The scandal clearly did not impede Mr. Tyson's rise to power. Don Tyson, who had taken over after his own father was killed in a 1967 car accident, stepped down as chief executive in 1995, when he turned 65.
First, Leland Tollett, a longtime Tyson executive, was named chairman and chief executive. In 1998, when Wayne Britt took over as chief executive, John Tyson became chairman, replacing his father, who became senior chairman. Last year, when Mr. Britt resigned for personal reasons, John Tyson added the title of chief executive. The company would not say if other candidates were considered, but John Tyson was the highest-ranking family member in the company. (His two younger sisters once worked there.)
In the 1980's, Randal Tyson, Don's half brother, had been groomed for a major role at the company, but he died in 1986, at 34, after choking on food. Family friends say he and John Tyson, who were only a year apart, were close; a few days before the death, the two had talked at length about how they would some day run Tyson. Don's death made John, despite his troubles, the most likely heir to the throne.
"Let's be real -- it's a fairly controlled operation," said Clark Irwin, a senior vice president who heads Tyson's food service division, and a childhood friend of John Tyson. "And without Randal here, you figure it had to fall into John's hands at some point."

Running Things His Way
Just outside his oak-paneled oval office, Mr. Tyson is showing off his art collection -- prints by Willem de Kooning, Lichtenstein and Warhol -- and a table made from stainless steel parts rescued from a processing plant. Among the works that predate his tenure are bronzed cowboys and a giant mounted marlin.
He has a sense of the history at Tyson. Down the hall is a replica of the office his grandfather occupied at the time of his death, a memorial with the clock stopped at the hour he died: 12:30 p.m.
Mr. Tyson wants to leave his mark, he says, and he is bringing his own style. Like his father, he has a puckish grin; he is gregarious and adventurous, perhaps to a fault, his friends say. He also has the capacity to shock and play the bad boy, they add, as he seemed to do in his court testimony in the Espy case.
According to his court testimony, Mr. Tyson said he used to charter company planes for football games and that his father liked to have company-sponsored parties for the sole purpose of getting his friends drunk. He also said Tyson's board was "nonactive" and served at the pleasure of the chairman and the management team.
That comment drew criticism from the California Public Employees' Retirement System, the nation's largest pension fund, which had been pressing Tyson Foods to abolish its dual-class stock structure and put more outsiders on its board.
Tyson officials dismiss the criticism, saying the dual-class stock creates stability in the company. They also say Mr. Tyson's testimony may have been taken out of context.
Mr. Tyson's friends say that he has calmed down, now that he has gone through a spiritual awakening. (He often attends Bible classes.) He and his wife of 11 years were divorced in 1998, but he is a dedicated father with joint custody of his two children, ages 8 and 10, the friends say. He arranges his travel schedule so that he is home every other week, when he has custody.
Following his father, who was considered a visionary and a risk taker, John Tyson has already rolled his own dice, on IBP. He says the merger will make Tyson "the Procter & Gamble of the meat case."
The question for investors, of course, is not whether John Tyson can make deals, but whether he can make them work. Does he have the skills to manage a company that is about to more than double its size and abandon its "focus on feathers" in offering beef and pork as well as chicken?
The company's earlier attempt to diversify, by acquiring smaller beef, pork and seafood units, failed miserably, partly because of its inexperience in those businesses and the units' small size. By 1999, Tyson had sold them all.
Mr. Tyson faces other challenges, too. First is completing the deal for IBP, which is cooperating with an S.E.C. inquiry into possible accounting irregularities at DFG, a Chicago company that IBP bought in 1998.
Because of the inquiry, IBP has restated its earnings for the past two years and taken a charge against earnings of $162 million. Tyson executives could pressure the company to alter the terms of the agreement because of the findings -- or they might just walk away.

No Plans to 'Chickenize'
Tyson, meanwhile, is laying the groundwork for the merger. Mr. Tyson is trying to allay the fears of ranchers about the rapid consolidation of the food and agriculture industry. Some wince at the idea of one company dominating the meat industry and possibly altering the dynamics of the beef industry.
Tom Bias, director of governmental relations at the National Farmers Union, said some ranchers feared that big processors would force smaller rivals out of business, by lowering prices, and then seize control of the market.
"That could leave just Conagra, Tyson and Smithfield," Mr. Bias said. "Tyson has contract farming, which turns farmers into tractor drivers and manure shovelers. Tyson has a long history of doing this in the poultry industry."
To assuage fears, Mr. Tyson has promised that the company will not "chickenize" the beef industry by trying to control the entire process from raising and slaughtering the animals to marketing the beef. "Our expertise is on marketing and convenience items and taking them to the next level," he said. "We want to spend our money on marketing."
Yet Mr. Tyson has also shown that he will stake out his positions with a tart tongue when necessary. Environmentalists accuse Tyson and other big processors of operating giant factory farm operations that foul rivers, streams and other water supplies. But he complains that activists are unfairly criticizing his company. And on regulatory issues, he says, the rules are a moving target, and the pace of regulatory change is costly and confusing to companies.
"We don't want to spend our money, and 12 months later things have changed," he said, as if speaking to regulators. "Don't make us guess where you're going."
He also uses the bully pulpit on labor issues. Tyson and other big meat processors are all struggling with high turnover rates, labor shortages and allegations that they hire and unfairly treat illegal workers.
Mr. Tyson acknowledges that there are labor problems. He says Tyson is moving to automate its processing facilities, to cut costs and to improve safety. As for accusations of unfair labor practices, he says Tyson treats its workers well, and he disputes government findings that indicate many poultry companies are violating the Fair Labor and Standards Act by not paying workers properly.
The biggest challenge faced by Tyson is whether it can truly transform itself from a giant chicken operation into a diversified meat company, one that can deliver fatter profits.
After two decades of double-digit growth in profits, shares of Tyson peaked in late 1998, and then dropped sharply over the next two years on a weakening profit outlook. Since Mr. Tyson took over last April, the stock has recouped some of those loses, closing on Friday at $12.60, but remains down about 50 percent from the 1998 high. Although Tyson's profits fell last year to $151 million, on slowing sales of $7.1 billion, analysts are hopeful about the IBP prospects.

A More Polished Approach
Mr. Tyson, of course, says the IBP deal was something the company had to do. Tyson had missed the opportunity to add IBP in 1981, when it was acquired by Occidental Petroleum. And, with retailers and food service companies consolidating, Tyson felt pressure to bulk up.
"Right now, the top five retailers have 48 percent of the business," Mr. Tyson said of the grocery store market. "They expect a vendor to be able to service them to meet a basket of goods. Now, we're big, and we have the three primary proteins."
His confident words may be indicative. After his unusual rise to power, Mr. Tyson has grabbed the company's reins, perhaps too tightly at first, Wall Street analysts say. In public, he seemed too ebullient, too flippant in his talks with investors and others, they say.
But his presentation last week at a conference in New York seemed more mature and polished, they said. Though, as a young boy, he had insisted that he did not want to run Tyson Foods, that might have been posturing, friends say.
"I think for a while Johnny was searching around, trying to find his niche," said Mr. Bassett, his childhood friend. "But I would say he's always wanted to do what he's doing right now."

CORRECTION-DATE: March 11, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about John H. Tyson, the chairman and chief executive of Tyson Foods, misstated the month that former President Bill Clinton pardoned Archibald R. Schaffer III, the company's former communications director. It was December 2000, not January 2001. 
Because of an an editing error, the article omitted a word in a quotation from Donald J. Tyson, the company's senior chairman and John H. Tyson's father. He said of his son's rise to power: "Within the past 10 years, he's stepped forward and proven himself as a serious business person;" he did not say "Within the past years."

AS President Bush sent his budget blueprint to Capitol Hill last week, he offered an exquisitely calibrated view of government that seemed just slightly to the right of President Clinton's "third way": "Government should be active, but limited, engaged, but not overbearing." Just the right size for a public that consistently shows mistrust of "government" but strong support for individual government programs. A careful middle ground.
 Then why are so many conservatives so happy -- and liberals so despairing? Because, both sides believe, Mr. Bush's neo-Clintonian formulations mask a major shift in the vision of government and a new stage in a philosophic debate that has raged across two generations. Mr. Bush's proposed $1.6 trillion tax cut, combined with his leaner budget and his proposals to remake Social Security and Medicare, could begin to turn the battleship of the federal government in a direction conservative Republicans have wanted for a long time. 
 It would, they believe, revive and retrofit the Reagan revolution -- by putting new spending constraints on the federal government with the tax cut; by ceding more responsibilities to state and local governments and religious institutions; and by transforming two great monuments of the New Deal and the Great Society, with partial privatizing of Social Security and Medicare. 
"I personally love this president," said Paul M. Weyrich, a longtime conservative activist. Grover G. Norquist, head of Americans for Tax Reform, a conservative group, said Mr. Bush's tax cut, the biggest since 1981, would limit government in important, lasting ways. "If you don't take that money off the table, they will spend it in Washington," he said. "Everybody understands that's the fight. The left understands it."
The old stereotypes of free-spending, big-government Democrats and tax-cutting, government-off-our backs Republicans were oversimplified, particularly in the Clinton era, when Democrats embraced the cause of fiscal responsibility and balanced budgets -- thanks, in part, to some powerful pushing from a Republican Congress. It is true, though, that Congressional Republicans are hardly immune to the joys of spending money. Meanwhile, last week Mr. Bush sounded at times as if he were channeling Hubert H. Humphrey. Proudly pointing to his new spending initiatives in education and medical research, he declared, "A budget's impact is counted in dollars, but measured in lives."
Yet, even now, when so much of politics seems a centrist muddle, there are enduring differences between the parties on the role the federal government should play on a range of domestic issues.
Consider health care: Democratic voters are still far more likely than Republicans to believe the federal government should do something major to cover the uninsured and to add a prescription drug benefit to the Medicare program, according to a new study by researchers at Harvard and the Kaiser Family Foundation. On Capitol Hill, Democrats tend to lead the charge to protect traditional Medicare. Republicans tend to want to inject more competition, consumer choice and market forces into what they insist is a creaky bureaucracy. 
Such divisions have dominated the politics of the past 10 years, with each side overreaching at times -- Mr. Clinton's bid to reorganize the private health insurance industry in 1993 and 1994, for example, and Speaker Newt Gingrich's bid to pare Medicare in 1995. Both engendered a backlash in the next election.
Mr. Bush and his advisers clearly learned from this; as many analysts noted last week, he neither calls for hard choices nor uses tough language in his speeches. A group of voters assembled by Democratic pollsters to watch the speech "had no sense at all that he was posing a philosophical choice about the role of government," said one pollster, Geoffrey Garin. "What people interpreted Bush as saying was that the surplus was so large that they can have it all," he said, "and, in fact, it was a point that made some people nervous."
BUT there is a real choice posed by the Bush tax cut and the reconfigurations it will require in the rest of the budget. Democrats and their allies assert there simply isn't enough money to pay for Mr. Bush's tax proposals, protect the Medicare surplus, add a meaningful prescription drug benefit for Medicare and finance the rest of his initiatives, even with the slowdown he proposes in other government spending.
Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., the director of the Office of Management and Budget, obviously disagrees, insisting: "There is not 'more than enough room' for the president's relief plan. There is vastly more than enough room." But Democrats argue that the "reserve" fund at the heart of this have-it-all argument is "oversubscribed," meaning the government will ultimately face hard choices, including returning to deficits or deep cuts in spending.
Until now, voters took a fairly tempered view of a tax cut. A survey by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, conducted between Feb. 14 and Feb. 19, found that when voters are offered a list of possible uses for the money, the idea of tapping the budget surplus for a major tax cut is only slightly more popular than a year ago. Thirty-seven percent said the surplus should shore up Medicare and Social Security, compared with 19 percent who preferred a tax cut. A Washington Post-ABC Poll, released just before Mr. Bush's speech, found a similar result.
Support for a tax cut is higher when voters are not asked to rank priorities. For example, a CNN/ USA Today Poll asked, "Do you favor or oppose the federal income tax cuts President Bush has proposed?" Sixty-eight percent said they favored them before the speech; 79 percent favored them after. Still, Stanley B. Greenberg, who polled for Vice President Al Gore's campaign, cited the earlier trend, asserting: "There's something that's holding people back. I think they still think it's not quite the right thing to do." Democrats clearly intend to appeal to those doubts, while Republicans argue the tax cut is a win-win proposition. 
In fact, liberals argue that the question of priorities is fundamental. Robert Greenstein, head of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research group, rattled off a list of problems last week -- long-term care for the elderly, the 43 million Americans who lack health insurance, lack of drug coverage for the elderly, the long-term financing problems of Social Security and Medicare -- and argued the surplus was a once-in-a-generation opportunity to address them.
"There's a half-dozen problems we could make real progress on, and this budget says that's not the route we want to go," he said.
But John F. Cogan, a senior fellow at Stanford's Hoover Institution, who worked in the Reagan administration and now advises Mr. Bush on economic and budget matters, sees government expansionism as a risk, not an opportunity. "These surpluses are a great opportunity for the country, but they also present a danger," he said. "The danger is they will be used to expand the size and scope of government."
Not even many Democrats make a strong case for big new government spending initiatives now. On an issue like the uninsured, Theda Skocpol, a professor of government and sociology at Harvard, said: "Ten years ago we were saying, 'Gee, we'd like to do it if we could afford it.' We don't even mention that anymore. I don't think that's Bush and the Republicans alone. The whole discourse has shifted."
CONSERVATIVES argue that, indeed, the country has changed. "What would have been considered 10 or 20 years ago radical conservative positions -- consumer choice in Medicare and education, Social Security that's defined contribution rather than defined benefits ---- are now consensus positions of the center-right coalition, and 70 percent of the public is reasonably comfortable with them," said Mr. Norquist.
"Bush understands that the country is to the right of where his father thought it was," he added. Even so, there is still criticism in some conservative quarters that Mr. Bush's tax cut is not big enough.
Yet Democrats are not completely in despair, remembering how formidable Mr. Clinton looked in 1993, when he urged Congress to pass universal health insurance. They say Mr. Bush is only beginning a process that will require him to spell out the details and trade-offs of his plan, and thus test its true appeal. The lessons of the last 10 years suggest that voters, with all their conflicting views about government, will eventually listen closely.

HEADLINE: New Economy; 
Access charges are tumbling in Vietnam, where the Internet is seen as a gateway to other business.

BYLINE:  By Matt Richtel 

DATELINE: HANOI, Vietnam 

 BODY:
HANG BE STREET flirts with chaos, as dozens of moped riders dodge and weave among bicyclists and pedestrians. 
 But inside a half-dozen businesses on the block, matters could not be more in lock step. The impetus is the Internet, which has caused the outbreak of a price war, providing a textbook case of capitalism. 
 Recent months have seen a boom in the number of Internet cafes, not just on Hang Be but in several districts of the city as well. In turn, access prices have dropped so rapidly that cafe owners have taken to writing over outdated prices or even printing them on disposable signs. 
It is a price war that conjures a bit of mystery because it now costs but pennies an hour to be online here, far less than the price of access in the United States. 
Dang Duc Thuc said the matter was as plain as a plate of white rice. "The more cafes, the cheaper the price," said Mr. Thuc, who owns a chain of AtoZ Queen Cafes, which are among the two dozen or more businesses now loudly advertising Internet access in Hanoi. 
The cafes, hostels and tour offices that offer Net access are interspersed on tourist streets with stores selling counterfeit compact discs, trinkets or inexpensive meals. Employees of the Internet shops beckon passers-by with promises of "fastest Internet" or "cheap Internet" like madams cajoling cowboys into an Old West brothel.
Mr. Thuc said his cafes had two advantages: they were the oldest in Vietnam and offered the fastest connection. But other cafe owners made clear that these are widely shared distinctions, and each claimed to have brought the Internet to Hanoi in 1997. 
There is one matter on which all agree: the cost of access. They say it started at about 800 dong a minute, or about $3 an hour. It quickly declined to 700 and then started falling faster than the Nasdaq. In the last year, it has slid to 300 dong from 500, and more recently to 200 or 150 a minute, depending on the establishment. 
It turns out that such a price war was not unique to Hanoi in this part of the world. Travelers in the region say access prices dropped in the tourist area of Katmandu, Nepal, over the two weeks they went on a trek. 
Joe Cummings, an author for Lonely Planet guidebooks in Southeast Asia, said Internet access charges were dropping across the region. In particular, he said, rates have dropped some in Laos and steeply in Thailand, where a cutthroat price war has driven costs to a few pennies an hour to log on. Mr. Cummings was at a loss to explain the phenomenon. "I don't know how they're making money," he said. 
Back at the AtoZ cafes, the same question was put to Mr. Thuc: If computers cost $500, can you make money charging less than $1 an hour? "Maybe not," said Mr. Thuc, who turned out to be a man of few words, or at least few words of English. 
He did, though, manage to convey that the Internet nevertheless has a value to the cafes, tourism shops and hotels that offer it. The reason, he explained, is that the entrepreneurs use the Internet to attract customers and then sell them other services, like tour packages, hotel rooms or a cup of coffee and a fried egg.
Matei Mihalca, the Internet analyst at Merrill Lynch in Hong Kong, filled in an additional piece of the puzzle. Mr. Mihalca said Internet entrepreneurs hoped to make money by buying one connection to the Internet and then splitting it among a handful of computers. This method, he said, keeps costs down. But, he added, that still doesn't make it easy to make money, given how low the prices have dropped. 
Then again, the price reflects the overall cost of living here. A sumptuous feast of chicken in garlic sauce, rice and beer costs $2, tops. A night in a charming, French-influenced hotel costs $20.
But local incomes are commensurate, which means many Vietnamese have neither the money -- nor the training -- to venture into cyberspace themselves. Vu Van Phuong, 28, who taxis people around the city on his Honda 50 Deluxe moped for about $1.50 a day, said he had heard of the Internet but did not know what it was and found the idea of spending 200 dong a minute amusingly extravagant. 
His attitude may help explain the low prices charged by people like Ng Thang Hang. "Most Vietnamese think the Internet is useless," said Ms. Hang, the manager of the Trekking Cafe, outside of which Mr. Phuong had parked his bike. A sign outside the Trekking Cafe advertises a 10 percent discount on Internet access (ordinarily 200 dong a minute), but Ms. Hang said there was another advantage to logging on at Trekking: "In my shop, the speed is the fastest."
The sharing of one Internet connection among many users has a side effect: during busy times, access can be painfully slow. Such pain registered glaringly on the face of Verity Sessions, a 34-year-old British woman who was waiting to download e-mail at the AtoZ cafe on Hang Be Street. 
"I've been waiting like eight or nine minutes for the page to come up," Ms. Sessions complained. Then again, Ms. Sessions said she couldn't complain about the price. Nor does she shop around, looking to save a few dong. "I'll go anywhere where the price is close" to the going rate, she said. 
If recent history continues to serve as a guide, she'll be able to do just that: go anywhere. The prices appear to be continuing to drop, lock step, among the growing number of cafes. At this rate, it's only a matter of time before the Internet is ubiquitous -- and cheaper than spending an afternoon eating a plate of garlic chicken and drinking a beer.

HEADLINE: 'Seinfeld' Star Planning Pilot With NBC 

BYLINE:  By BILL CARTER 

 BODY:
 In an unusual deal based on an unusual format for a TV series, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, one of the stars of the NBC comedy hit "Seinfeld," will make a pilot for a new comedy for NBC that, if made, could spur changes in the traditional economics of a television series and the scheduling of the network prime-time season. 
 The proposed series, still untitled, would produce only 15 episodes a season, rather than the 22 to 25 that other network series develop, making it more difficult for the series to attain the number of episodes needed to sell it in the lucrative syndication market.
The show's creative innovation is to present one continuous real-time scene, 22 consecutive minutes, of a slice in the main character's day, interrupted only by commercials. Ms. Louis-Dreyfus described her character as "a mildly successful singer in Los Angeles who performs in cabaret clubs or else sings jingles for grocery stores."
NBC has embraced the idea because, like other networks, it is looking for shows that reach out to viewers by altering standard storytelling formats. Very few new comedies have succeeded on the networks in recent years, and network research has pointed to increasing fatigue -- especially among young adult viewers -- with the familiar format of a family or other group in a living-room set dominated by a sofa. 
Instead, comedies have turned to surrealism, as in Fox's "Malcolm in the Middle"; totally improvised dialogue, as in HBO's "Curb Your Enthusiasm"; and stories told in overlapping flashbacks, as in Fox's "Grounded for Life."
Indeed, NBC's willingness to sign on for what amounts to a shortened series order shows the particular influence of HBO, which has developed a schedule that calls for the regular rotation of series in the same time slot, 13 to 15 episodes at a stretch.
Initially, Ms. Louis-Dreyfus sought even more radical changes in her show, including running each episode for 22 straight minutes with no commercial interruption, underscoring the real-time approach. NBC declined that notion, arguing that the network had to keep some of its usual business structures intact.
Ms. Louis-Dreyfus, who has been much in demand at several networks, insisted on limiting the number of episodes she will make each season as a concession to the real priority in her life. "I also want to be a mom," she said in a telephone interview. She and her husband, Brad Hall, a writer who created the new series, have two boys, ages 3 and 8.
Jeff Zucker, the president of NBC Entertainment, who made the deal with Ms. Louis-Dreyfus and Mr. Hall, acknowledged that the notion of doing only 15 episodes of a series disrupts the traditional structure of television series. "But the traditional system keeps so many good things from happening, we have to figure out a new economic model," Mr. Zucker said.
Both Mr. Zucker and Tom Werner, of the Carser-Werner-Mandabach Company which will produce the series, cited the success of one television series, HBO's "The Sopranos," as a goal for this show -- and others -- to shoot for.
"HBO does it," Mr. Zucker said. "They are able to go from 'Sopranos' straight into 'Sex and the City' to keep their schedule going." He said reports that Ms. Louis-Dreyfus would go back to a standard 22-episode season if her show succeeds were erroneous. "She's a family person," he said. "We have to work with her schedule."
Mr. Werner called "The Sopranos," which films only 13 episodes a season "event programming," adding, "Maybe we can do that with Julia's series: make it an event."
He acknowledged that shows usually need to make more episodes every season because they only really make money when they have accumulated about 100 episodes and can be sold into syndication. But Mr. Werner said: "If you do something terrific, the economics tend to work themselves out. It's a lot better to have 15 wonderful things than 22 not-so-wonderful things."
Most shows are produced at a deficit, which is why they need syndication money to become profitable. To counter that, shows with fewer episodes would need to receive higher network license fees to make a profit. If a show becomes a hit, it can ask for higher license fees. NBC did not disclose its financial arrangements for Ms. Louis-Dreyfus's show, and they probably will not be set until the network decides to commit to the series.
If the show were to succeed, it would present other problems: Mr. Zucker would be forced to find some new way to schedule it. "But that's O.K.," he said. "I think we're in a whole new era of television anyway, and we have to go in new directions."
Ms. Louis-Dreyfus, who is once and forever Elaine thanks to the reruns of "Seinfeld" -- television's biggest hit of the 1990's -- was besieged with offers for her own series from the moment the show went off the air. She pulled back, she said, partly to take care of her children, but also because she recognized what going back to television comedy would mean.
"It's extremely daunting," she said, referring to the high bar of great expectations set by "Seinfeld."
The challenge became even tougher this season when Michael Richards, who had played Kramer on "Seinfeld," brought a new series to NBC that flamed out after a strong start. Mr. Zucker said, "I'm not scared off by what happened with Michael Richards. This is a different project."
For starters, Ms. Louis-Dreyfus's show will not go on the air at all if NBC does not like the pilot, a decision that limits its financial risk. Mr. Richards's show was guaranteed a spot on the air and 13 episodes, which cost NBC heavily when the show failed quickly. If NBC does not order her series, Ms. Louis-Dreyfus will get what is known as a penalty payment -- a less costly commitment.
The show is also likely go on the air in the middle of the next television season, probably after NBC's broadcast of the Winter Olympics from Salt Lake City, offering it the best opportunity for promotion. If the series is successful, it might come back the following January after NBC uses a different comedy in the fall. That way NBC could limit the number of repeats it has to show during a season.
Ms. Louis-Dreyfus noted that she has spent her entire television career on NBC, having earlier been a cast member on "Saturday Night Live." "I sense a new enthusiasm at NBC with Jeff there," she said. "It feels right and comfortable to be going back."
Ms. Louis-Dreyfus said that after a period of enjoying simply being a mother, she started looking for a vehicle to return to work. "What I like to do is entertain," she said. All she has done since leaving "Seinfeld" is one musical movie on ABC, "Geppetto," and a guest appearance on "Curb Your Enthusiasm," which was created by the chief "Seinfeld" writer, Larry David.
"I loved working with Larry. It was a very pleasant reminder of how much I like to act," Ms. Louis-Dreyfus said. As for singing on "Geppetto," it certainly helped lead to the premise for the new series. "I do love to sing, it's joyful for me. And I have been trained. It's not like I just took voice lessons last week."
For a time she considered offers to join a Broadway musical in New York, but again she felt that would take her too far away from her young boys. After she started talking to some writers about a possible series last year, her husband Mr. Hall, without her knowledge, sat down and wrote a pilot script with her in mind. "The neat thing about it is that it's really like intimate observations of someone's life," Mr. Hall said.
The couple presented the script to several networks, not knowing what to expect. "It's not a straight-down-the-middle comedy," Ms. Louis-Dreyfus said. "There's a small cast of regulars. But it's not going to be us on a couch talking about biological clocks ticking down."
As for the short unhappy series experience for Mr. Richards, Ms. Louis-Dreyfus said that was no reason to resist going back to television. "There has to be life after 'Seinfeld,' " she said.

HEADLINE: In Hollywood, Strike Planning Turns From 'If' to 'When' 

BYLINE:  By RICK LYMAN and JIM RUTENBERG 

 BODY:
For some in Hollywood, the long-feared strikes of the spring and summer of 2001 are already beginning.
 "The town is really starting to quiet down from a production standpoint," said Amir Malin, chairman of Artisan Entertainment, an independent film production and distribution company. "Right now, almost all of us are on hold." 
 When negotiations broke down last week between the Writers Guild of America and representatives of the major Hollywood studios and television networks, even those who had been trying to ignore the prospect of potential strikes this spring and summer by writers and actors were finally left staring the catastrophe square in the face. It has caused many in the entertainment industry to go beyond wondering whether a strike will occur and instead begin calculating who will be hurt the worst: the television and movie studios, the strikers or the production workers caught in the middle. 
"You cannot emphasize enough the amount of damage that the strikes would do to the production industry in this country," said Bob Solomon, a senior vice president at Liberty Live Wire, which provides post-production services for film and television and has warned its workers to expect layoffs if the strikes occur. "I am talking about personal devastation for people who can't afford to go two months without a paycheck, as well as a flight of intellectual know-how from which I am not sure the industry will ever recover."
The 11,000 members of the Writers Guild, whose contract with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers expires at midnight May 1, had been in early negotiations for almost six weeks before the talks were suspended over the issue of residuals -- how much the writers will be paid under the new contract for use of their work beyond the first run in movie theaters and the first broadcast on television. While both sides said they remained open to new talks and were hopeful of a settlement, the guild decided that the gap between them was too large to continue talking at the moment.
Even more threatening to Hollywood is the prospect of a second strike by the 135,000 members of the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, which represent actors in films and on most television programs like sitcoms and dramatic series. Their contract expires on June 30, and while the studios and networks could probably weather a writers strike for several months before feeling a pinch, a walkout by actors would shut down production overnight and force others, from directors to editors to the people who serve meals on the set, out of work.
"There are two aspects to it," said Nick Counter, chief negotiator for the producers. "One is, what is the impact if the writers go out on strike and the other is, what if the actors go out, too? There's a substantial difference between the two."
If only the writers go out on strike, little impact would be felt until August, he said, when it would be time to begin production for the fall television season. 
If the actors go out, though, it would be time to close up the shop. News programs, reality shows like "Survivor" and others that do not use actors would be able to continue producing episodes (the writers for those shows are covered by a separate contract that expires in November, so they could continue working, too). But sitcoms, dramatic series, television movies and virtually all theatrical film production would cease in an instant.
Until now, the effects of the impending strikes have been masked by a rush to production, as studios have attempted to get as many films finished as possible before the June 30 deadline. But that surge is beginning to dry up. Films that do not begin principal photography by early April have little chance of finishing by the deadline, and there is usually a month or more of preproduction work. 
Entertainment consumers will first feel the impact on television. 
Among the programs that would be affected earliest are live late-night comedy shows like CBS's "Late Show with David Letterman" and NBC's "Tonight" show.
During the last strike, when the writers walked out in 1988, NBC's "Late Night with David Letterman" and the "Tonight" show both went into reruns for several weeks. But then the "Tonight" host, Johnny Carson, decided to go back into production under a special exemption from the union and Mr. Letterman followed suit. 
Maria Pope, the executive producer of "Late Show," said she and Mr. Letterman had not yet decided what to do this time. And NBC said Mr. Leno has told it that he would respect a strike and would not produce new shows.
During a conference call with reporters last week, Leslie Moonves, the president of CBS Television, said that in the event of a strike the network could rely on a schedule heavy in reality programs like "Survivor" and news magazines like "60 Minutes II" and "48 Hours." 
Bruce Helford, who is currently producing four half-hour, network comedies -- including "The Drew Carey Show" and "Norm" for ABC -- said the recent success of reality programs had made the timing of the labor negotiations unfortunate, and had put writers at a disadvantage.
He said a strike would have longer-term implications as well, giving reality and news programs a fresh opportunity to make inroads with audiences, and perhaps making it even harder for comedy and dramatic series to recapture viewers and broadcast time after a settlement was reached.
Since new series will not be announced by the networks until mid-May, and production work on them would not begin until early August, a strike longer than three months would make it impossible to get them on the air in the fall. Most current programs that are being carried to next season will conclude production in April and then begin shooting next season in August, so they, too, would not be ready for the fall.
But some producers have agreed to requests to make extra episodes of their series this season. These extra shows, could be held over until the fall. This might be enough to provide a bit of a buffer and give the network, if it wishes, the appearance of a limited fall season.
The WB, for instance, which does not have a news division that it can rely on to fill open time slots, ordered extra episodes of "The Steve Harvey Show" and "For Your Love," which will be shown in the fall. It also held back a new drama, "Dead Last," and will show it in the fall. 
Likewise, TNT delayed the showing of the second season of its drama set on Wall Street, "Bull," pushing it back to the fall.
To say the timing of the guild strike deadline is bad for the networks is a Super Bowl-size understatement. May 1 comes just weeks before the big television sponsors make their advanced advertising purchases for the new fall prime-time schedules.
Just how badly that will affect the networks' bottom lines is unclear. Each will unveil a fully developed fall schedule in May, and try to sell ads for it, regardless of the strike threat. But whether advertisers would be confident in the networks' ability to deliver is another question. It is anybody's guess as to whether ad sales could hold up this spring, longtime advertising and network executives said. 
Wall Street analysts warned last week that the Writers Guild's strike deadline raised the possibility for the first time in years that the networks would record negative growth in their annual May advance advertising sales period.
During the 1988 strike, the networks actually had slightly more revenue during the May advance sales period than they had the year before, but the gains dwindled later in the year. At the strike's conclusion, in August, the networks were slow to get their shows back on track. With rushed and late starts to their biggest hits, the networks lost as much as 10 percent of their overall ratings and were forced to compensate their sponsors with millions of dollars' worth of free ad time.
Tim Spengler, executive vice president and director of national broadcast at Initiative Media, a media buying firm, said he was still not sure what his strategy will be. "It's tricky," he said. "We're not going to know what's going to happen, so how much do you want to divert from the networks? And then, what if you find out the strike got settled in two months and they're fine?" 
Still, he predicted that any reduction in network television ad buying this spring will have more to do with the soft economy than the threatened strike.
By contrast, the major movie studios have been able to produce enough films to keep them in business well into 2002. A few studio officials even said they believed there would be enough films in the can by the strike deadline to last into early 2003. Indeed, the studios may see a boost in profits from the strike as they reap profits from previously produced films without shouldering the costs of new ones.
Certainly, the impact on the film studios will not be as immediate or, initially, as severe as what the television networks and cable channels will feel.
"But I think its naive to believe that it would be a very long time before the impact is felt in movies," said Jeffrey Katzenberg, one of the founders of the DreamWorks studio and a member of the producers' negotiating team.
Indeed, he said, the effect could be felt as early as the summer of 2002, a long way away in television thinking but right around the corner in the movie world. "I think in terms of the larger, event movies, the ones that take a lot of time and a lot of preparation, they are going to be the ones where there will be the most immediate impact," Mr. Katzenberg said.
While the studios have been rushing films through production in anticipation of a strike, he said, a look at the kinds of movies that are being made reveals a relative dearth of the kind of big-budget, event-type films that have been Hollywood's bread-and-butter for a quarter century.
"Most of the volume of production that has been taking place recently has been the small movies that could be rushed into production on a very short schedule," Mr. Katzenberg said. "Interestingly enough, one of the results of all of this is that there will be more of that kind of product in the short term than maybe we have experienced in a while. I don't know if that's good or bad."
John McLean, the executive director of the Writers Guild, said he did not want to discuss how a strike might affect his members, because he wanted everyone to focus instead on forging an agreement and averting the strike.
"My concern is that I'm still trying to make a deal," he said. "There are a lot of options other than a strike. We are eight to nine weeks away from the deadline on this contract and I've tried to stay away from the word strike."

HEADLINE: TELEVISION REVIEW; 
From Saints to Tulips to Coke and the Chic of Greed

BYLINE:  By JULIE SALAMON 

 BODY:
After the release of Oliver Stone's "Wall Street" in 1987, that film's manipulative broker, Gordon Gekko, became a symbol of an acquisitive era. "Greed is right," says Gekko in the movie. "Greed works." 
 Gekko's bottom line crudely sums up the operative theory in "Money and Power: The History of Business," a surprisingly breezy two-hour documentary tracing the evolution of business over the past millennium. The program celebrates the rise of capitalism, as you might expect from CNBC, the cable business-news channel, whose slogan is "Profit from it." 
 The producers acknowledge that greed has worked better for some than for others. "The process wasn't always pretty," says the former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul A. Volcker, who introduces the program. "Change isn't always fair." 
So we learn about the ruthlessness of John D. Rockefeller and Philip II of Spain, who brutally took gold and silver from the conquered Inca and Aztec people. (Spain used its colonies like A.T.M.'s, observes one historian.) We see pictures of the worn-looking workers who built America's transcontinental railway. The labor was so backbreaking that eventually only immigrants with no alternatives and hardened Civil War veterans would do it.
But this smart and well-edited documentary, with David Grubin as executive producer and Jason Robards as narrator, doesn't linger too long anywhere. It's a brisk survey course, using personalities and stories not economic movements and theories as benchmarks in the journey from serfdom to Internet shopping. Many historians give succinct lectures, which Mr. Grubin's team deftly illustrate with well-photographed works of art for the early periods, archival clips and cleverly filmed images of places and things.
It took a few centuries to distill the wisdom of Gekko from market theory. Early businessmen had to perform complex acts of self-deception to reconcile their desire for wealth with their hopes for eternal life. The earliest known self-made man was an Anglo-Saxon serf named Godric, who became a successful trader. But the Roman Catholic Church frowned on individual pursuit of profit. Godric found religion, gave his money away and became a saint.
As commerce developed, loopholes would emerge. By the 15th century Florence had become a banking center, despite the church's ban on charging interest on loans. (In Dante's "Divine Comedy," usurers were consigned to the seventh circle of hell.) Like Godric before him, Cosimo de' Medici, Forence's leading banker, began worrying about the fate of his soul as he grew older. But he didn't have to renounce his wealth. Pope Eugene IV struck a deal with Cosimo. He could stay in business -- and be absolved of sin -- if he would pay for the reconstruction of the Dominican convent of San Marco. Thus took root the charitable deduction.
It would take the people who founded Manhattan -- the Dutch -- to find a spiritual basis in mercantilism. "They thought the more money you had, the closer you were to God," says a historian. The Dutch developed the notion of corporate ownership and opened one of the first stock exchanges. They also helped create market panic, when tulips (then rare and new) became a precious commodity and were traded at astronomical prices until the market crashed.
The documentary touches on the geographic movement of commerce and the vast effects of technology on the way things are made and sold. It shows the shifts in financial power from kings to consumers and how advertising changed everything. Because of advertising, Coca-Cola became ubiquitous, the symbol of America's commercial imperialism in the 20th century. When Coke was first introduced in Europe, Italians dumped it on the streets of Rome and the French tried to ban it. But that was long ago.
Throughout all those centuries, businessmen continued to seek God's good graces. "Luce saw himself as God's collaborator," says Henry Grunwald, former editor in chief of Time, about the magazine's founder, Henry R. Luce, who was the son of missionaries.
The program ends very much in the present world. The cameras visit a group of women in a Laotian village, weaving silk as it has been done for generations. You can see their work -- and order it -- on the Internet. "The global market has made neighbors of us all," says the narration. There you have it. Greed is good, except, of course, when it isn't.

A WALK IN GREENWICH VILLAGE
Channel 13, New York, tonight at 8
As the former Senator Bob Kerrey settles into his new job as president of the New School University, he might want to take a quick orientation course about his new neighborhood. Channel 13 has just the thing, "A Walk in Greenwich Village With David Hartman and Historian Barry Lewis." This two-hour program being broadcast tonight at 8, is the fifth in the station's series of walking tours of neighborhoods in the city.
Mr. Lewis is a wonderful guide, the kind who gets excited just looking at a map. Mr. Hartman's morning-show host background trained him to be the perfect tourist: inquisitive, respectful and enthusiastic. The production values are plain. A camera follows these men in parkas as they walk through the Village's convoluted streets, making explanatory stops at all kinds of landmarks: bakeries, restaurants, theaters, clubs, coffeehouses and Mr. Kerrey's new home, the New School. 
With the help of visits with experts and simple graphics, mainly maps, photographs and etchings, Mr. Lewis gives loving and lively explanations of the various people who have come to Greenwich Village to reinvent themselves: people from abroad and from other parts of America. Though shoe stores now outnumber book shops, and the Beats seem quaint, Mr. Lewis makes it clear that in the Village -- unlike other parts of the city -- you don't have to strain your eyes to see the past.

HEADLINE: Critic's Notebook; 
Fireworks or Fallbacks for a New River City?

BYLINE:  By HERBERT MUSCHAMP 

 BODY:
Lightning struck the skyline twice last week. Two bright flashes lit up the future of architecture in New York. First came the announcement that Arquitectonica, the Miami-based firm, had been hired to design a set of residential high-rises for Queens West, the mixed-use waterfront development across the East River from the United Nations headquarters. Then came the news that five teams of architects would be competing to create a master plan for the development of the nine-acre Con Edison site, just south of the United Nations.
 This opens up an intriguing prospect: two private developers, facing off across the water, competing not just for profits but for architectural distinction. Would anyone else like to join the fray? Let's see who can build not only taller or faster but who can build best. An architectural free-for-all on the East River: that's my idea of fireworks on the Fourth of July. 
 Arquitectonica's design for Rockrose Development Corporation, developers of the 74-acre site in Queens where Pepsi-Cola was bottled and canned until two years ago, is still in development. But it's not too soon to comment on the promise of this project and the obstacles faced by the architects in fulfilling it. The project, expected to cost $1 billion, will occupy almost 22 acres in the northern area of Queens West. It will include seven apartment towers, for a total of 3,000 new units. There will be 13.5 acres of parks, streets and other public spaces. 
Arquitectonica is sui generis. Bernardo Fort-Brescia and Laurinda Spear, the firm's principles, were the first American architects of the baby-boom generation to start building on a large scale.
The Spear House in Coral Gables, Fla., designed by them in collaboration with Rem Koolhaas, was among the most photographed residential designs of the 1970's. Later, Arquitectonica imprinted itself on the public imagination with the high-rises the firm designed for Brickel Avenue in Miami.
As featured backdrops in the 1980's television series "Miami Vice," these towers helped establish the new image of that city as an economic and cultural crossroads between Latin America and the United States. And they defined the specialty for which Arquitectonica has become known: a highly inventive, often colorful manipulation of the tall building type. 
Arquitectonica is the Ricky Martin of contemporary architecture. While retaining Latin roots, the firm has built widely around the world. Its cosmopolitan outlook suits Queens West.
There is nothing profound about this firm's work. On the other hand, there is none of the spurious historical depth asserted by the retro buildings at Battery Park City and Riverside South. This brings us to the obstacle Arquitectonica must reckon with in attempting something fresh. Queens West, sponsored by a division of the Empire State Development Corporation, is stuck with a Battery Park City-clone master plan and design guidelines.
For a site where views are paramount, the guidelines restrict the use of glass in favor of masonry walls. Instead of encouraging new approaches to planning, the master plan mandates neo-traditional towers on bases with uniform street lines. Can the bishop's-crook lampposts, world's-fair benches, hexagonal pavers and other theme-park accessories be far behind? Will we have Gene Kelly look-alike doormen dancing to "Singing in the Rain"?
Arquitectonica should be given the widest latitude in responding to the conditions of the site. After all, the context here extends far beyond the neighboring low-rise brick buildings of Long Island City. It also includes the midtown skyline, the river and its bridges, the airports in Queens and, not least, the United Nations headquarters and all it symbolizes for the city and the world beyond.
That is the context, too, for the Con Ed site. These two new projects should be seen as parts of a loosely defined whole: a new river city, with two waterfronts, in which the East River will serve as a unifying public space, an aquatic Central Park. The United Nations would provide this new city's landmark anchor.
The Con Ed site is being developed by FSM East River Associates, a partnership between Fisher Brothers and Sheldon H. Solow. Described by the developers as the largest site of undeveloped land in Manhattan, the property has been dominated for nearly a century by a Con Ed steam plant, which will be demolished.
The developers envision a mixed-use project of office and residential towers, with the precise mix not yet determined. It will also include shops, parks and other recreational spaces. 
It could take three to four years to obtain the required approvals, including the city's Uniform Land Use Review Procedure. The developers may also face challenges from environmentalists, public space advocates and other civic groups. Construction costs have not been estimated for the project, which could total five million square feet.
The competition finalists, chosen from a roster of 40 firms, include three winners of the Pritzker Architecture Prize. The five teams of finalists are: David Childs of Skidmore Owings & Merrill, Richard Meier, Peter Eisenman and Hugh Hardy; HOK Architects and Schuman Lichtenstein Claman Efron; Kohn Pedersen Fox, Rem Koolhaas, Davis Brody Bond and Toyo Ito; Henry Cobb and James Ingo Freed of Pei Cobb Freed & Partners, and Machado & Silvetti Associates; and Christian de Portzamparc, Gary Edward Handel & Associates.
The finalists will present their proposals in sketchbook form late next month and early May, with the winning team to be designated shortly thereafter. The competition is being led by Bill Lacy, executive director of the Pritzker Prize and president of Purchase College of the State University of New York. The composition of the jury has not been announced, though it is expected that the final decision will be made by the developers themselves.
It is exceptional, in New York, for a private developer to go for architecture, much less to adopt the competition system as a way to get there. But there are good reasons to guard our optimism in this case.
One could imagine a more brilliant lineup. To judge from this list, it appears that the developers are trying to weigh economic factors and architectural values in the same scale. It is perilous to mix quantities with qualities. The temptation to confuse one with the other is often too great .
It is safe to say, for example, that the architects at HOK will not be winning Pritzker Prizes any time soon. You do not, for instance, need a competition if a strictly commercial firm like HOK is under serious consideration. You hold a competition to get on the high road. Otherwise, it might be easier to try the Yellow Pages.
The finalists bring a range of experience and aptitude to the competition. Mr. Koolhaas and Mr. Ito represent artistic risk. HOK stands for ultimate fallback. Mr. Portzamparc signifies a continental sophistication that may lie beyond worldly grasp, or at least local reach. The other two teams are the respectable choices. Aren't we tired of respectable choices?
Short competitions allow little time for architects, clients or jurors to educate themselves in subjects that should form the basis for informed judgment. This is a major disadvantage in New York, where standards have been low for a long time. Architectural innovation depends on its relationship to precedent. The Con Ed site has a powerful one in the United Nations headquarters, which itself is now facing the need for expansion and repairs.
The architectural ambition of the developers, the international scope of the competition and its emphasis on team collaboration: these factors were also instrumental in the design of the United Nations. The design process, supervised by Wallace K. Harrison, is documented in George Dudley's fine book "A Workshop for Peace." The process remains an ideal toward which architects and clients should reach.
Another precedent can be found in the fantastic X-City complex, a private, mixed-use development designed by Harrison for William Zeckendorf on what was to become the United Nations site. Commissioned by Zeckendorf, X-City included offices, apartments, waterfront parks and a domed, lozenge-shaped building intended for an opera house and an orchestra hall. But in 1946 the Rockefeller family purchased the property from Zeckendorf and donated it to the United Nations.
Harrison's work is the subject of serious study and appreciation today, to a degree not equaled even in his lifetime. The X-City plans are among his finest. Harrison's fusion of modern rationality and romantic theatricality is still a sound touchstone for envisioning this great waterfront site. It would be ludicrous to replicate Harrison's forms. It's his thinking that bears emulation.
Harrison's optimism about the future is particularly apt. Nothing could be more disastrous than to repeat the Battery Park City formula of ersatz prewar urbanism. We have seen the past, and it doesn't work. Not in contemporary architecture, anyhow. Once you start regressing down those dreary "New York Was Yesterday" skids, you close the door to art.
This is the moment for New York to recast itself creatively for its place in the worldwide information city. Come May, when the Con Ed site's developers select the winning team, the jurors will have their turn to be judged.

HEADLINE: In New Orleans, Recession Could Hurt Past Welfare Recipients 

BYLINE:  By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, March 3 

 BODY:
The evening skyline of this old port glitters with the logos of Sheraton, Marriott, Hilton, Meridien, Doubletree, Wyndham. Below sprawl Harrah's gilded new casino, beery and boisterous Bourbon Street and the French Quarter's cajun cafes.
 Brisk as they seem, these businesses make New Orleans a likely ground zero in the next recession. All catering to conventions and tourism, all low-wage businesses paying workers from $5.15 an hour, the minimum wage, to $9 an hour for making beds and clearing tables, hotels and restaurants form the essence of the local economy. When consumers and businesses turn skittish in a slowing economy, employees in the tourism industry are early casualties. 
 That next recession, economists say, is likely to strike the lowest paid workers unusually hard. The two big safety nets they could turn to for support in earlier recessions -- unemployment and welfare benefits -- have become markedly shredded. Many of the most vulnerable workers are mothers who have left the welfare rolls, and many of them will find that they are ineligible for either benefit. 
"In the event of an economic downturn," the General Accounting Office, Congress's research organization wrote in a study released in January, "many low-wage workers may find that, unlike higher-wage workers, they will be unable to qualify for unemployment benefits.
"While the situation deserves attention on its own merits, the sweeping changes in national welfare policy heighten its importance." 
Economists and state employment officials say, the slower economy has not yet led to significant unemployment. The unemployment rate, 4.2 percent in January, is still very low by historical standards. But signs of trouble have begun to appear here. 
New Orleans last year had the largest increase in unemployment, to 4.7 percent from 3.4 percent, of 337 metropolitan areas, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And welfare rolls have been creeping up after four years of sharp decline. The city has weathered other economic slumps. What is different this time is that the lowest wage workers have less than before to fall back upon.
Under the federal-state unemployment benefit program, laid-off workers collect a weekly check, typically 10 percent to 25 percent of their previous weekly earnings, for as long as 26 weeks.
Intended to help sustain workers who lose their jobs while they look for other work, the program supports only 38 percent of them, a long, slow erosion from 50 percent in the 1950's. More important, in the fast-growing sector of low-wage service and retail work, fewer than 20 percent of workers qualify.
Meanwhile, the overhaul of the welfare system nearly five years ago limited lifetime benefits to five years. Some states, among them Louisiana, allow benefits for only two years in a five-year period. Advocates for the poor and many economists keep warning that a slump in the labor-hungry economy will hit recently employed welfare recipients hard.
"They're kind of straddling two logs that are coming apart," said Wayne Vroman, a labor economist at the nonpartisan Urban Institute in Washington. "They're neither fish nor fowl."
Nakeetha Stark, 24, a mother of four, is one of those caught in the middle. At a New Orleans welfare office recently to reapply for $477 a month in food stamps, Ms. Stark said, "I'm in a no-money cycle." 
Ms. Stark said she had exhausted her eligibility for welfare. Though she was a well-tipped waiter in expensive restaurants, she is ineligible for unemployment benefits, she said, because she was not laid off. She said she quit to breast-feed her third child.
With few exceptions, the nation's 130 million workers ostensibly are covered by state-managed unemployment insurance benefit programs. The programs are financed by a tax that employers pay on at least $7,000 of every worker's wages.
But low-wage workers are often unable to qualify for unemployment benefits, because eligibility is tied to previous earnings.
Qualifying for benefits can be tricky. Here, as in many states, an applicant must have worked at least 6 months of a 12-month period, but earnings in the most recent 3 to 6 months do not count in computing the benefit. So a welfare recipient who started a low-wage job last summer and has lost it would probably be ineligible.
In addition, to receive Louisiana's minimum benefit of $10 a week for 26 weeks, an unemployed worker must have earned at least $1,200 when employed. The maximum, based on earnings of about $22,000, is $260 a week. To keep collecting the benefit, workers must offer proof that they are looking for a new job.
In most cases, they must also be willing to accept full-time work, even if their previous job was part time. With children at home and child care hard to find or too costly, those who have no choice but to work part time are excluded.
For example, the General Accounting Office calculated that in 13 states, a person who worked 20 hours a week for 20 weeks at the $5.15 federal minimum wage -- a typical schedule for former welfare recipients with children -- would be ineligible for an unemployment benefit. In contrast, the study said, a person who worked 20 hours for $10 an hour would be eligible in all states but Washington.
Moreover, the benefit applications of workers who meet all the criteria are often rejected because employers have incentives to thwart payment of the benefit: companies with a history of many layoffs, for example, pay a higher tax than those with few layoffs. For this reason, employers often contest applications and eligibility criteria, arguing, for example, that workers were not laid off but fired for misconduct, making them ineligible for benefits. The companies often succeed in disqualifying the applicants. In 10 states, including Louisiana, no more than one in four of the unemployed collect the benefit.
Disputes over eligibility are particularly common in Louisiana. Denise Butler, 39, a mother of three, was applying for the benefit a few days ago at a state employment office here. Ms. Butler said she had worked 30 to 40 hours a week as a cashier at a supermarket for $5.30 an hour.
"I was fired for insubordination," she said. "A manager said I pitched a turkey at a customer."
She said she passed the turkey to the customer and that the manager simply disliked her.
"I did that job very well," she said. 
Mr. Vroman of the Urban Institute said, "Louisiana has an unusual frequency of employers bringing allegations of misconduct."
Louisiana employers contest a fourth of the state's benefit applications on grounds of misconduct, he said, compared with a national average of 1 in 10.
Until recently, ineligibility for unemployment insurance was not much of an issue for low-income workers with children to rear. Recently laid off or never employed, they needed only to show that they were poor to qualify for a welfare check.
With the new welfare system's time limits and work requirements, recipients must get jobs. Taking courses in work skills and actively searching for work can stretch Louisiana's two-year limit. But with the economy softening, previous recipients who had gone to work are reapplying for welfare and newcomers are joining the rolls.
So, in Louisiana, unlike in nearly all other states, welfare caseloads are rising, after a 67 percent decline in four years.
"Over the last six months, we have seen a slight increase in our rolls," said Renea Austin-Duffin, the state's secretary for social services in Baton Rouge. "We're monitoring it. We haven't isolated any one cause. But it does seem to be statewide."
Many of the welfare recipients in New Orleans get help in looking for jobs by state offices for family support. Daniel Tuman, manager of the uptown office said his office steers about 100 people into jobs each month from its caseload of 1,200 families, most headed by single parents.
"Over six months," Mr. Tuman said, "it's not unusual for half to lose their employment." That long predates the changes in the welfare system, he said.
"It's often not a transition to stable employment," he said. "People lose jobs and get another. It's more back and forth."
But lately, Mr. Tuman said, his caseload of welfare applicants, including people who have lost their jobs, has been creeping up.
"That has to do with the economy," he said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Aids Conversion-Minded Quake Relief in El Salvador 

BYLINE:  By DAVID GONZALEZ 

DATELINE: GUADALUPE, El Salvador, March 3 

 BODY:
An American evangelical relief group that is using private donations and United States government money to help victims of two earthquakes has blurred the line between church and state as its volunteers preach, pray and seek converts among people desperate for help.
 Residents of several villages said volunteers from Samaritan's Purse, which has received more than $200,000 from the United States Agency for International Development and is to receive a second similar amount, has held half-hour prayer meetings before showing them how to build temporary homes of metal and plastic provided by the American government. 
 According to interviews with numerous villagers here and elsewhere in this predominantly Roman Catholic country, volunteers of the Protestant group have distributed religious tracts and asked them to accept Jesus Christ as their savior.
"They said a lot, but the principal thing was God and that earthly things do not matter," said Oscar Romero, a villager putting finishing touches on his house. 
Officials of Samaritan's Purse note that the group does not condition its help on acceptance of specific religious belief, adding that it has brought considerable private resources here, which they may use in any manner. The message it spreads is not seen as unusual in this deeply religious country, but it is spread in a society where Catholics and evangelical sects have long been at odds.
The group's use of federal financing has troubled aid officials and relief workers, who said the mixing of relief and religion could possibly conflict with contract guidelines. That issue comes as federal agencies are trying to adapt to President Bush's plan to provide government aid to religious groups involved in social services.
"It may very well be that this is a very fuzzy area right now," said Kenneth Ellis, the director of the Agency for International Development mission in El Salvador. "I know our legal office in Washington is struggling with how do we deal with faith-based organizations."
Government money cannot be used to overtly finance religious activities or to provide selective help based on political or religious beliefs, said Kim Walz, a spokeswoman for the agency in Washington.
The agency's federal counsel has also written that religious groups should not "promote religion at the public expense by using U.S. government funds or U.S. government-financed goods or services to promote sectarian purposes."
Dr. Paul Chiles, the country director for Samaritan's Purse, said the group neither discriminates nor proselytizes aggressively. At the same time, he said that its mission was understood and accepted by the federal government, which is helping it build more than 2,000 homes.
"We are first a Christian organization and second an aid organization," he said. "We can't really separate the two. We really believe Jesus Christ told us to do relief work."
He said that although the group did not rely on prayer meetings when delivering aid, he did not think it was inappropriate to deliver a message of hope to people for whom religion is part of daily life.
"We definitely don't ever use the gifts that we bring as a means to change people," he said. "We distribute it to people in need. At the same time, we bring the message of the Gospel." 
That message is central to its relief work, according to the group's Web page, which quotes its president and chairman, Franklin Graham, son of the evangelist Billy Graham. The Web page notes that in one village where the group provided supplies, 150 Salvadorans converted after watching a movie about Jesus.
"When we go into these villages and help people get back into their homes, we hope we'll be able to plant new churches all over this country," Franklin Graham said on the Web page.
Unlike other religiously affiliated relief groups, who try to team up with local groups expert in housing or community development, Samaritan's Purse has drawn volunteers from local evangelical congregations. "When we build things, we say we build it with the love of Jesus, because that's why we are here," Dr. Chiles said. "If we worked with the Peace Corps or the Red Cross, I don't think they would be comfortable doing this."
Such statements have raised suspicion among many relief workers here, who noted that other religiously affiliated relief groups had spun off their relief work into separate entities that received federal financing.
The 31-year-old group is a newcomer to housing work in El Salvador, but it has worked in more than 100 countries, including Honduras, where it built 5,000 homes after Hurricane Mitch.
Senator Jesse Helms, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and a critic of the Agency for International Development, has held up Samaritan's Purse as an exemplary religious relief group. Some American relief officials privately complain that members of Congress have put pressure on them to finance the group's work, even though they have serious reservations about its proselytizing.
"It's easier to fund them rather than make enemies," said one official who insisted on anonymity.
Officials noted that Samaritan's Purse met performance goals, and that there was therefore no reason -- aside from the religious reservations -- not to finance it. Still, others worried that the group walked a very fine line.
"They are hitting these people when they most vulnerable," said one relief worker long active in the region. "It may not be pressure, but it sure is taking advantage of a period in people's life when they will do anything like that to get a house."
Villagers who received houses were grateful and did not think the religious message was improper.
"They come to preach the word of God and to receive the word of God," said Iris Yolanda Minero Flores, a health worker in San Roman. "It is a comfort and helps give us strength. We all have to accept the word first, then receive what people send."
Dr. Chiles insisted that his group was not looking for converts, and that need was the only criterion for help. The conversion of 150 people mentioned on Samaritan's Purse's Web page is credited to the pastor of a local evangelical denomination that is the group's aid partner.
The seeking of converts has been a sore point among El Salvador's Roman Catholic majority. In recent weeks, local clergy members said, relations between the two groups have again been rocky, because some local evangelical groups have conditioned aid on accepting their religion.
"They see this as something where God speaks to the people," said Bishop Elias Bolanos, the Catholic prelate of Zacatecoluca. "They have started campaigns of preaching, bringing people together every day to say God is punishing them. They are very pessimistic."

PERSON: Cardinal Theodore Edgar McCarrick 

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES; 
An American Cardinal Who Works to Help the World

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
AT the Mass of thanksgiving in his honor, Cardinal Theodore Edgar McCarrick began his sermon yesterday with a description of the sun-drenched Vatican ceremony a few weeks ago when he became a cardinal. Then he dived into the Gospel reading for the first Sunday of the dour season of Lent, the devil's temptation of Jesus in the desert.
 In the cardinal's hands, this familiar story about the stubborn attractions of wealth, power and glory took on a pronounced flavor of Washington and the temptations facing the last standing superpower. 
 "In a way the devil was saying, 'Don't try to make the world better, just take it over,' " said Cardinal McCarrick, who rarely preaches from notes. "That's a temptation we all have to fight, trying to take control of other countries or people instead of cooperating and seeking counsel." 
Trying to improve the world step by halting step is the vocation of this much-traveled cleric who insists that his focus on human rights overseas and against sweatshops and homelessness in the United States are as much a part of his job as saying Mass.
"I don't want to come across as some high-class holy person," Cardinal McCarrick said after the service at the Basilica of the National Shrine here. "I don't do it as well as I'd like to do it, but this is all real to me."
Sweatshops, homelessness and displaced people have been real to him since his childhood in Manhattan during the Depression. His sea-faring father died of tuberculosis when he was 3 years old, forcing his mother, Margaret McLaughlin McCarrick, to find work at a Bronx factory making automobile parts and to live with various relatives in an extended Irish-American clan. 
"It was a great family," the cardinal said. "They always made room for my mother and me, whether it was my Uncle Tom when he was still a bachelor or my Grandfather and Grandmother McLaughlin."
In this boyhood of threadbare Irish family life and priests and nuns, the cardinal said his strongest identity was with his parish and school, not his New York neighborhood, Washington Heights. 
"When people asked me where I was from I'd say Incarnation; I'd give them the name of my parish," he said.
When the priests walked into those schools and asked who was going to become a priest, "80 percent of us raised our hands," the cardinal said. "We all wanted to be like them."
THEN adolescence struck. The young Ted McCarrick started dating and lost any sense of a holy vocation until his senior year at the Fordham Preparatory School, when he started thinking, "maybe God will allow me to become a priest."
After graduation, a school friend invited him to spend a year in Switzerland -- an unheard-of luxury made possible by his friend's family. But instead of pulling him away from his faith, Europe and the study of history and languages gave him time to become convinced of his vocation. 
After studying at Fordham University and at St. Joseph's Seminary in Yonkers, he was ordained into the priesthood in 1958. By 1965 he was president of the Catholic University of Puerto Rico. He returned to New York and rose to become vicar of East Manhattan and the Harlems, eventually becoming archbishop of New Jersey. 
At the same time, he became a leading Catholic voice on international issues, pursuing economic and social programs in countries like Haiti, Yugoslavia and Rwanda and seeking debt relief for poor nations. He toured China on behalf of the Clinton administration to discuss religious freedom and human rights.
"The suffering is the same," Cardinal McCarrick said. "The terrible needs of the poor are the same here or there."
His arrival as archbishop of Washington at the beginning of the year seemed a natural fit. Days after he took office, he dined with President Bush and his wife, Laura, at the archbishop's home.
Oddly, at that dinner the president did not mention his plans to expand the role of religious organizations in assisting the needy.
"I let the president lead the discussion and he didn't bring up his faith-based initiative," the cardinal said yesterday. 
If he had, Cardinal McCarrick said he would have told Mr. Bush of his fear that the government would get out of needed social assistance and hand it over to the religious groups. "It can't be what's happened in the past with the federal government saying the churches can carry it for the poor," he said.
Instead, the dinner talk was all about foreign affairs, with the cardinal speaking up for some of his pet causes. One of the most urgent at that moment was the need for more assistance after the earthquake in El Salvador on Jan. 13. With more than 100,000 Salvadoran parishioners in his archdiocese, the cardinal said he felt as if the disaster had affected his own family.
A few days after that dinner, he made a quick trip to El Salvador, taking money for those displaced by the earthquake. He also asked that the thousands of Salvadorans living illegally in the United States be allowed to stay and work for at least a year to send back money to help their families, and their country, recover.
Last week Mr. Bush agreed and gave temporary protected status to those Salvadorans.
"You can't separate your work by just helping on the inside of the church," the cardinal said yesterday. "All of the teaching we have is to change the world for the better on the inside and the outside."

HEADLINE: Norway's Thoroughly Modern Royal Pair 

BYLINE:  By WARREN HOGE 

DATELINE: OSLO 

 BODY:
With a free Saturday on his hands and a new downtown apartment to fill, the affable 27-year-old man known simply as Haakon put on jeans, sweater and sneakers, bundled himself against the Nordic winter in a gray duffel coat and went to check out some sounds in a record store and shop at discount houses.
 Hours later, he returned home with his purchases and was greeted by his lover, Mette-Marit Tjessem Hoiby, 27, and her 3-year-old son, Marius. 
 So far, this is nothing out of the ordinary for Oslo, where even the most urbane people dress informally, more than half of children are born out of wedlock and cohabiting is common. 
But just how common this particular pair are permitted to be has become a test for the famously tolerant Norwegians. 
Haakon is the country's hereditary prince, a man who one day will quite likely have to trade his earphones for a king's crown. 
And Ms. Tjessem Hoiby is the woman he intends to make his future queen in a grand cathedral marriage this summer even though her son's father is a convicted cocaine supplier and she had a well-known past in Oslo's dance-and-drugs house party scene. 
"They are taking on a difficult project that will require sacrifices," wrote Knut Haavik, the editor of Se og Hor (See and Hear), a celebrity magazine that has devoted acres of space to the tantalizing subject. "One cannot arrange a royal wedding with a thousand guests, then go to a house party afterward.
"If the young members of the royal family behave like us normal folk, then we don't need them. But if they are willing to take the challenge that the role demands, I assume that the people will give them all the support and warmth they need."
The Norwegian monarchy is not the fairy-tale kind, and Norwegians like it that way. The country abolished its aristocracy in the 19th century, and there are no pampered dukes and duchesses to throw tabloid tantrums. Each morning's changing of the guard is more a tin soldier affair than plumed-hat pageantry, and it takes place in public gardens before the unadorned brick and plaster royal palace while office workers hurry past, not noticing.
Haakon is a direct descendant of Queen Victoria, but he was educated in public schools and did his higher education not at Balliol College, Oxford, as did his father, King Harald V, and grandfather, Olav V, but at the University of California, Berkeley, where he publicly reveled in a society markedly more diverse than those in Scandinavia. 
Some Norwegians wonder if the modern-minded heir even favors maintaining the monarchy. A princely smile of recognition greeted mention of this notion during a conversation in Haakon's palace office. His suite, as understated as he is, sits off a white columned hall at the top of a grand staircase leading to the balcony where the family officially surveys the realm on festive days. 
"Well, first of all, if I can say a little bit about me being a monarchist, the thing is, I see it from the other side," he said. "I really don't have to argue for or against; that's sort of up to the Norwegian people." 
When he realized his love and his duty might be on a collision course, he contemplated renouncing his claim to the throne, but quickly decided against it. 
"I think actually it's a good thing that one tries to reflect over the different consequences of your possibilities," he said. "But I think this is where I'm supposed to be."
He said his family had been "fantastic from the start."
"I talked to them a lot about this in the beginning before it was known in the press," he added, "and then I decided to speak out about these issues myself instead of all these rumors going around. What I said basically was, you know, we as people go through different stages, and that's how it is with my girlfriend, as it is with myself and probably anyone else. And we change with time."
The support of his father may be owed to experience. Harald spent 10 years trying to persuade his own father, Olav V, to approve his marriage to his commoner childhood sweetheart, a shopkeeper's daughter who is the present Queen Sonja. And in 1994 he had to intervene when his own daughter, Princess Martha Louise, now 29, was cited as a co-respondent in a divorce proceeding in England where she had been training in riding competitions. Harald cited royal prerogative, and that was the end of that. 
Opinion polls show that the popularity the royal family has long enjoyed with Norway's four million citizens remains as high as ever since announcement of the engagement in December. 
"What he lost in respectability of older people, he gained in respectability from younger people," said Lars Roar Langslet, 65, a former culture minister and biographer of King Olav.
Trond Nordby, 57, a professor of political science at the University of Oslo known for his antimonarchist views, said, "Some younger people think Haakon is like a rock star." The prince once took a course in which the professor spelled out his argument against the monarchy, and had come to see Mr. Nordby afterward to debate the points. 
One of Haakon's young admirers, Ine Marie Eriksen, 24, a law student from Tromso who is leader of the Young Conservatives, said: "Why should they have to live by the rules of the 18th century? That would take away the very thing that the Norwegian people like about our monarchy." 
Norway had a long royal pedigree, but it died out during 500 years of Danish and Swedish rule. The current monarchy began only in 1905 when Norway gained complete independence from Sweden, and it is consequently deeply associated with the country's sense of its own nationhood. 
There have been only three kings -- Haakon VII (1905-1957), Olav V (1957-1991) and the current monarch, Harald V, who is 63 -- and all have been sovereigns with the common touch that appeals to Norwegians.
Haakon VII earned their admiration by refusing to give in to Nazi occupiers and taking the royal family into exile in London. His English wife, Queen Maud, was the daughter of Edward VII, and Norwegians recount with delight a well-known story of the reception Haakon VII received when he showed up at the BBC in London to make a wartime broadcast. "Sorry, dear," the harassed receptionist is said to have asked him, "where did you say you were king of?"
During the oil crisis of 1973, Olav endeared himself to his countrymen by abandoning his car and driver one day and taking a seat on the public tram. Asked by a reporter if he was not concerned for his safety, he said, "No, I have no fear, not with four million bodyguards."
Every year a motion to install a republic is routinely put forward in Parliament and just as routinely rejected. Mr. Langslet recalled that in the 1980's a leader of the Socialist Left party lamented, "Even if Norway had a president, Norwegians would go out and vote for the king."
Asked what he had studied in his three years at Berkeley, Haakon listed international relations, economics, third-world development, international law and a course on the European Union. The last was an intriguing choice, because Norway has chosen to stay out of the group.
"I think that the monarchy can stand for certain values in society -- one being respect for human dignity, the others being tolerance and environmental issues," he said. "I think we can say something about international solidarity. These are bipartisan issues."
Haakon has been criticized by bishops of the official Lutheran Church for his current living arrangements and his outspoken support for homosexual rights; the church, which he may one day head as king, has barred the ordination of homosexual clerics. 
"When it comes to what I said about tolerance, women's issues and rights for homosexuals of both genders, I was saying that on the basis of civil society," he explained. "I didn't go into the ongoing discussion in the Norwegian church because that's a matter I shouldn't have an opinion on." 
He said he valued his freedom to walk around Oslo in relative anonymity and had never thought of donning a disguise. "Oh, no, I think that would be embarrassing if I were found out," he said.
At least two security people trail him discreetly; the age of innocence for major Scandinavian figures mixing in public came to a violent end in 1986 when Prime Minister Olof Palme of Sweden was assassinated by a gunman on a Stockholm street as he was walking home from the movies with his wife. 
Haakon and Ms. Tjessem Hoiby are going to be married Aug. 25 in the Domkirken, Oslo's cathedral, and while things will be celebratory, it will be in the plain Scandinavian manner. Waves from the balcony, yes; gilded coaches, no. "We don't have a tradition for carriage rides here," he said. "Cars will have to do."
The Norwegian Constitution now permits women to ascend to the throne so the couple's first-born child will be the heir apparent. As for her son, Haakon said, "Marius will be a full-fledged member of our family, but he will not get a title, unless my father decides to give him one, and I don't think that's very likely." 
Ms. Tjessem Hoiby is auditing lectures on ethics at the university but is evidently taking on a full course load with the royal household. 
"Because of the marriage coming up and her new role in life" Haakon said, "there's quite a lot of time she needs to spend on getting to know the palace and the way we operate here." 
And what about him? Did he imagine he could maintain his informal private life when he becomes king? 
Haakon sighed at the thought. "Let's say you might see me less in record stores 20 years from now," he said.

HEADLINE: Sales of Painkiller Grew Rapidly, But Success Brought a High Cost 

BYLINE:  By BARRY MEIER and MELODY PETERSEN 

 BODY:
Dr. Peter Leong recalls the day when he finally snapped at a drug company salesman pressing him to prescribe a powerful narcotic painkiller called OxyContin.
 The drug's producer, Purdue Pharma, had already failed to persuade Dr. Leong with repeated offers of free weekend trips to Florida to discuss pain management. But when the salesman suggested that OxyContin -- which is as potent as morphine -- was safe enough to treat short-term pain, Dr. Leong exploded. 
 "We threw him out of my office," said Dr. Leong, who runs a pain clinic in Bangor, Me. He thinks OxyContin is potentially too dangerous to use for anything but chronic, severe pain. "OxyContin is a good drug," he said. "But the problem was, they were pushing it for everything." 
If Dr. Leong was not a convert, many others were. In a little over four years, OxyContin's sales have hit $1 billion, more than even Viagra's. Although the drug has helped thousands of people in pain, its success has come at a considerable cost. An official of the Drug Enforcement Administration said no other prescription drug in the last 20 years had been illegally abused by so many people so soon after it appeared.
OxyContin has been a factor in the deaths of at least 120 people, and medical examiners are still counting, according to interviews with law enforcement officials. And doctors like Dr. Leong, pharmacists and law enforcement officials say part of the problem is that Purdue Pharma often oversold OxyContin's benefits without adequately warning of its potential for abuse.
The company also used an often criticized but increasingly common marketing strategy: currying the favor of doctors in private practice with free trips and paid speaking engagements. Purdue Pharma, based in Norwalk, Conn., paid the transportation and hotel costs for hundreds of doctors to attend weekend meetings in spots like Florida to discuss pain management, a company consultant said. Doctors were then recruited and paid fees to speak to other doctors at some of the 7,000 "pain management" seminars that Purdue sponsored around the country. Those meetings stressed the importance of aggressively treating pain with potent, long-acting painkillers like OxyContin.
Purdue also contributed to foundations supporting research on pain, to pharmacy schools and to Internet sites aimed at educating consumers.
As OxyContin's marketing message spread, the drug caught on with many doctors who medical experts said had little experience in prescribing powerful narcotics. As a result, they often could not spot those who intended to abuse the drug or who did not need it in the first place.
OxyContin, introduced in December 1995, has offered patients something different: a tablet that slowly releases its powerful pain medication, permitting patients, for example, to sleep through the night. "It's a good drug in the right situation," said Dr. Art VanZee, a physician in St. Charles, Va. 
Purdue officials say they have promoted the drug responsibly and would have disciplined any sales representative who did not. They also said that in informing doctors about the drug, they told them how to spot potential drug abusers, and they have responded quickly to reports of spreading problems.
"We don't have strong medicines that don't have abuse potential," said Dr. J. David Haddox, the company's senior vice president for health policy. "What we have to do is walk the balance between helping the greater good, knowing there are always some people who will divert drugs."
Abuse and addiction involving OxyContin have spread quickly in the last two years, flaring up in at least a dozen states. And while the illegal use of OxyContin took root in rural areas along the East Coast, it has begun moving into cities like Philadelphia. "Nobody is immune from this," said Brantley Bishop, a narcotics investigator in Alabama. "I'm seeing housewives; I'm seeing loggers, nurses, mechanics."
OxyContin was originally thought to be less prone to abuse because its narcotic was locked in a time-release formula. That meant it would not produce the quick spike of euphoria that drug abusers crave. But abusers quickly discovered how to disarm the time-release formula; they simply crushed the tablet, then swallowed, inhaled or injected the powder to give themselves a high as powerful as heroin's. 
Getting OxyContin was often easy. A person simply had to find the right doctor, claim great pain and get a prescription. Others just stole prescription pads and wrote their own.
Illegal use of OxyContin mushroomed even though no drug in this country is more tightly regulated. Unlike illegal drugs like cocaine or heroin, OxyContin is monitored by state and federal health officials in its production, marketing and distribution. Now, many of those regulators are trying to figure out how the outbreak occurred and what they might have done to prevent it.
The Food and Drug Administration, for one, is reassessing how it reviews prescription narcotics for potential abuse. "We've learned something from this," said Dr. Cynthia McCormick, director of the F.D.A.'s division of anesthetics, critical care and addiction drug products. Dr. McCormick acknowledged that the F.D.A. had failed to research all the ways abusers might tamper with OxyContin, an oversight she said her agency did not want to repeat.
Last Thursday, officials of five states met in Richmond, Va., to discuss ways to halt illegal traffic in OxyContin. In recent months, Purdue has also stepped up its efforts to halt the drug's abuse, including working with law enforcement officials. 

Selling a 'Miracle' Drug
OxyContin came to market amid a sea change in how doctors treated pain. For years, terminally ill patients suffered needlessly because doctors resisted prescribing frequent, potent doses of narcotics, fearing that patients might become addicted. 
But with new studies showing that doctors undertreated pain, OxyContin provided a breakthrough opportunity for Purdue Pharma. Until then, the company's biggest drug was MS Contin, which had limited appeal, partly because it contained morphine. OxyContin had broader appeal because it contained a synthetic version of morphine called oxycodone, which, among other things, carried less of a social stigma.
"If Grandma is placed on morphine it's like, 'Oh, my God,' " said Dr. Howard A. Heit, a pain specialist in Fairfax, Va., and a Purdue consultant. "But if Grandma comes home placed on OxyContin -- that was O.K."
Although other pain medicine had long contained oxycodone, OxyContin differed in two key respects: it had a time-release formula, and it could be delivered in larger doses because it did not contain the type of nonprescription pain relievers that in larger quantities could cause liver damage.
The F.D.A. approved OxyContin for those with moderate to severe pain lasting more than a few days.
OxyContin is often prescribed for people in chronic pain, like those with back problems or severe arthritis, as well as patients with cancer and other painful diseases.
For Robert E. Mitchell, OxyContin proved nothing short of a wonder drug. A victim of Guillain-Barre syndrome, a rare nerve disorder that can cause paralysis, Mr. Mitchell said his pain had become so severe he could not walk. But with OxyContin, he can now wear shoes and has learned to walk again.
"To me, it's like a miracle," he said.
Seeing great potential in the drug, the company hatched an ambitious marketing plan. To reach consumers, Purdue financed an Internet site called Partners Against Pain, where OxyContin is promoted. It also contributed to groups like the American Pain Foundation, which championed the need for better pain treatment.
Still, most of Purdue's marketing dollars were aimed at doctors. In recent years, Purdue brought in 2,000 to 3,000 doctors to three-day retreats in California, Arizona and Florida, estimated Dr. Heit, the Purdue consultant. At those meetings, doctors were lectured about treating chronic pain, while being recruited to serve as paid speakers at medical meetings sponsored by Purdue.
Dr. Susan Bertrand, who treats chronic pain in Princeton, W. Va., became a Purdue speaker. She said that for her, recent studies showing the undertreatment of pain had been "almost a religious experience," making her realize how poorly she and others had been trained to deal with the problem.
To help change that, she said, she gave about a dozen paid speeches sponsored by Purdue. The company also helped her start the Appalachian Pain Foundation, an educational group on pain management.
Purdue's marketing campaign quickly began to pay big dividends, with OxyContin sales almost doubling every year, according to IMS Health, a firm that tracks drug sales. OxyContin now earns more in sales than any other narcotic. It also now accounts for 80 percent of Purdue Pharma's revenue, according to court documents filed by Purdue in connection with a patent dispute.
Some doctors and pharmacists said they were put off by the company's sales tactics.
"All companies market," said Dr. Diane Meier, a pain specialist at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York. "But these people were in your face all the time."
Others criticized the way Purdue recruited doctors. "Essentially, they bought the doctors' prescriptions," said Steve Schondelmeyer, a professor of pharmaceutical economics at the University of Minnesota. "It says to consumers that every time you paid for this drug, you sent your doctor to a nice meeting somewhere."

A Growing Concern
Purdue Pharma's critics agree that doctors must learn how to manage pain better. But Dr. Ted Parran, an associate professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, says doctors, in their rush to find a remedy, may have been blinded to another problem: addiction.
"Pain medicine docs are on a mission," said Dr. Parran, who teaches doctors how to use narcotics. "In the process, they tend to trivialize addiction."
In this regard, pharmacists play an important backup role for doctors. They provide the last medical defense for preventing addictive drugs from getting into the wrong hands. For instance, they can choose not to fill suspect prescriptions.
Some pharmacists said they, too, found Purdue's safety claims overblown.
John Craig, a co-owner of Hancocks Drug Store in Scottsburg, Ind., remembers a Purdue salesman walking into his pharmacy several years ago with reassurances that OxyContin was safer than other narcotics.
"They were going around to doctors promoting that this was the answer to all abuse," said Mr. Craig, but he already knew that local people were using OxyContin to get high. Since then, the abuse has become worse.
Another pharmacist, Samuel A. Okoronkwo, refused to fill an OxyContin prescription for someone he thought might be an abuser. He said a Purdue salesman suggested he could get into trouble for arbitrarily not filling prescriptions. "I told him I didn't have to fill a prescription that I didn't feel was medically necessary," he said.
Another druggist, Joseph Yates in Grundy, Va., said simply, "The problem with this drug is the company."
Purdue did not comment when asked about such anecdotes.
Concern about Purdue's marketing practices has also reached the D.E.A. An agency official said its investigators had recently interviewed doctors and druggists about their dealings with Purdue.
That official said the agency was worried that Purdue was not clearly communicating the drug's serious potential for abuse. "It may take years to repair the damage that this drug has done," said that D.E.A. official, who declined to be identified.
Told of the D.E.A. comment, Purdue responded with a statement that said in part: "In 15 years of marketing narcotic analgesics, Purdue Pharma has never been questioned by the Drug Enforcement Administration regarding our marketing practices."
In May, however, the F.D.A. did question a company advertisement for OxyContin, saying Purdue had improperly implied that OxyContin could be used to treat arthritis patients without first trying milder drugs. A company spokesman said that it disagreed with the F.D.A. but had voluntarily withdrawn the ad.
Dr. VanZee, in St. Charles, Va., has seen the destruction the drug has caused in the valleys and small mining towns of the southwestern part of that state. He said he was treating OxyContin overdoses in youngsters he had vaccinated as infants.
In the past two years, OxyContin has been a factor in the overdose deaths of 28 people in the area, said an official of the state medical examiner's office. It is difficult to tell the precise cause of an overdose, however, because more than one drug is often involved and OxyContin's active ingredient is in other drugs.
One area clinic, the Life Center of Galax, expected to treat 20 patients in its new methadone program but must now find a way to treat 300, most of them addicted to OxyContin, a clinic official said.
To stem this abuse, Dr. VanZee said, he met last fall with Purdue representatives in a bid to persuade them to cut back on their marketing and to issue a nationwide alert about the drug's hazards. The officials, Dr. VanZee said, appeared sympathetic, but said they viewed the problem as being limited to just a few areas of the country. 
"They are either very naive about the extent of the problem," Dr. VanZee said, "or they don't understand what it means to have 300 people in your county addicted -- the type of pain that causes in a community and in families."

Addressing the Problem
Purdue officials said they were as surprised as anyone that OxyContin could be abused. Dr. Haddox of Purdue said he thought the time-release formula would make the pill "less desirable to addicts." 
That is not the case now. Last September, the company gathered 20 consultants to look for better ways for doctors to spot potential abusers, said Dr. Heit, the consultant. Four months later, Purdue asked its sales force to remind doctors that drugs like OxyContin "are common targets for both drug abusers and drug addicts."
Purdue said it was now planning to reformulate OxyContin, making it less appealing to abusers. The company is also helping to educate students on the dangers of prescription drugs. 
Moves like this have recently earned the company praise from some law enforcement officials.
Some health officials think OxyContin abuse might have been more quickly identified had more states closely tracked the prescribing patterns of narcotics; some 17 states do that now.
Hospitals are addressing the problem in different ways. Mercy Hospital in Portland, Me., gives OxyContin patients urine screens to verify that they are not taking too much, or that they are obtaining the drug but not taking it and then selling it on the street.
A Cincinnati-based hospital chain, the Health Alliance, decided last month to limit OxyContin to just a few types of patients, like those with cancer, after determining that another painkiller was just as effective, cheaper and less prone to abuse.
Purdue Pharma -- and some doctors -- now worry that media reports on OxyContin abuse are scaring away patients who need the drug. "The publicity, of which you are a part, is causing patients to call us in tears because their physicians are taking them off therapy," said Robin Hogen, a company spokesman. "This is becoming a sad case of patients being abused by drug abusers."

Three Founders Of Purdue Pharma
Unlike many drug companies that are publicly traded, Purdue Pharma is privately held and part of a network of concerns founded by three brothers, Arthur, Mortimer and Raymond Sackler, all of whom were trained as research psychiatrists and have illustrious ties to the arts and sciences. 
A wing of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington bears the name of Dr. Arthur M. Sackler, who died in 1987. He and his brothers also financed a wing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art that houses the Temple of Dendur. In 1995, Dr. Raymond R. Sackler was knighted by Queen Elizabeth in recognition of his contributions to the sciences, arts and astronomy.
The company is now run by the son of Dr. Raymond Sackler, Dr. Richard Sackler, a surgeon who has served as a director of the foundation of the American Medical Association. A Purdue Pharma spokesman declined to make the Sackler family members available for interviews.

HEADLINE: Census Figures May Give City A Bonus Prize 

BYLINE:  By JANNY SCOTT 

 BODY:
When detailed results of the 2000 census come surging out of Washington this month in a river of numbers that will flow for several years, planners for New York City cautiously expect, the city's population count will turn out significantly higher than estimates suggest.
 One reason for their optimism is that they were allowed, for the first time, to update the address list that the Census Bureau used for the count, and persuaded the bureau to add 370,000 households that the city says were missing, the equivalent of a medium-size city. 
 When the bureau then released the first statewide numbers from the 2000 census in December, the population count for New York State was 830,000 higher than projected. The planners and some other demographers suspect that the additional New York City households may go a long way toward explaining that gap.
"We think, without question, the lion's share of that surprise increase is a result of this effort," the director of the Department of City Planning, Joseph B. Rose, said in an interview. "Unless there are people pitching tents in the woods, you can't hide 900,000 people, except in the City of New York." 
If Mr. Rose is right and the city's count jumps in part because of the newfound households, the numbers will suggest impressive growth -- at a time when subway ridership, the real estate market and many other aspects of city life have already left many New Yorkers feeling that the place is inordinately jammed.
But it will be unclear how many of the additional people are new arrivals and how many were here all along. Many newfound households are said to be in extra units in basements, garages and rear rooms of one- and two-family houses in places like Queens. Some of those units may have existed since the 1970's.
"One of the things we as planners will have to do is figure out how much of this was an actual increase and how much was our own detective work," Mr. Rose said. "Because if we have a neighborhood that has 50,000 more people living in it, you'd better figure that out. That has implications for school seats, it has implications for transportation service."
New York City's population count is used to calculate everything from crime rates and per capita income to federal grants and political influence. It has emotional heft, too. Growth signifies attractiveness, health, a promising future.
New York City's official population count climbed to nearly 7.9 million in 1950 from 3.4 million in 1900. Then it leveled off in the 1950's and 1960's and plunged by 800,000 between 1970 and 1980 before inching back to 7.3 million in the 1990 census.
"Both the 60's and the 70's were hard decades for New York City in different ways -- the 60's because it was a period of rapid racial and economic change and suburbanization, the 70's because of the fiscal crisis," said John H. Mollenkopf, director of the Center for Urban Research at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. "The 80's and 90's have been stronger for the city because of economic growth and immigration, but there has been a continued white departure."
The 1990 census count was badly flawed. The bureau said it had missed as many as a quarter-million New York City residents; others thought it had missed more. The city went to court to challenge the Bush administration's refusal to allow statistical sampling techniques to be used to adjust the numbers, but the effort failed.
In the meantime, the 1990 count became the basis for the bureau's subsequent annual estimates of New York's population, using a model that also takes into account births, deaths and migration. The most recent estimate, from 1999, put the city's population at 7.42 million.
Any big increase for New York City could take on added significance in light of the Census Bureau's decision last week to urge the commerce secretary not to use adjusted figures for the 2000 population tally to make up for millions of uncounted people. William G. Barron Jr., the Census Bureau's acting director, said the bureau had been unable to determine whether adjusted figures would be more accurate. 
Under law, the bureau is required to release detailed counts of each state's population by April 1. The first to come are likely to be states like New Jersey that need the numbers early for redistricting because of coming elections. Some may be released this week. 
In a recent interview, neither Mr. Rose nor Joseph J. Salvo, the director of the department's population division, would estimate what the new New York number might be. (It became apparent, though, that that question was the subject of an office pool in the population division.)
Emanuel Tobier, a professor of economics and planning at the Robert Wagner Graduate School of Public Service at New York University and an expert on the census, said he thought there was a strong possibility that the new number would be close to eight million.
James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, said: "The psychological effect of growth can't be underestimated, because most Northeastern cities have been declining in population since the 50's. This certainly would counter that and would be a major population turnaround."
Though the address lists that the Census Bureau uses to mail out census forms used to be confidential, Congressional legislation in the early 1990's gave communities the chance to review the lists to be used in 2000 and to make a case for adding any addresses that seemed to be missing.
In most places, the bureau based its address lists for the 2000 census on the United States Postal Service's lists of delivery points. In New York City, the planning department suspected that approach had missed certain units, like garages illegally converted into apartments.
"One of the places where mailing lists are likely to be deficient is cities with very expensive housing and many immigrants living in units not ordinarily recognized as units," said Reynolds Farley, a research scientist at the Population Studies Center at the University of Michigan.
So during a two-year period in the late 1990's, as many as a dozen people working for the department updated the list. They compared it with tax rolls, lists of building permits and lists supplied by utility companies, then they visited selected neighborhoods to try to confirm their findings.
Tony Farthing, the Census Bureau's regional director, said in an interview that he could not yet say how many of the 370,000 addresses proved valid. But Mr. Salvo and Mr. Rose said that the bureau confirmed 284,000 and that the city was able to appeal decisions against contacting the remaining ones, so the bureau mailed forms to all 370,000.
Many of those addresses were units added to one- and two-family homes where mail goes to one address and is sorted by residents instead of by postal workers, the planners said. Others included units in otherwise commercial buildings, and apartments in large buildings in Manhattan where a doorman or superintendent sorts the mail.
When the bureau released its population counts for every state, the New York number was 18.97 million. Though that was 830,000 more than the bureau projected in July, some other states had large numbers of "extra" people as well.
There are several possible reasons for a gap between an estimate and an official count, apart from the updating of address lists. If better outreach by the Census Bureau made for a better census in 2000 than in 1990, as the bureau believes, that could help explain the difference.
"The strong likelihood is that a great proportion of the formerly missing people who've been picked up are in New York City," Mr. Mollenkopf said, crediting the change to the city's efforts and the bureau's outreach work, especially in minority neighborhoods.
Another question is how many people the 370,000 extra households might represent. That depends on what percentage of those units were unoccupied and on the size of the households, said Terri Ann Lowenthal, an independent consultant who works with groups that have an interest in census data.
One of the many things that the city's population count can affect is the distribution of political power. As a result of the census data released in December, New York State will lose two Congressional seats, perhaps one upstate and one downstate.
Mr. Hughes, the Rutgers dean, said that if the additional people in the state turned out to be in New York City, that could not only increase its representation in the State Legislature but also make it harder to justify eliminating a Congressional seat in the city.
Not all possible ramifications, of course, are equally weighty.
"I'm hoping it goes to eight," Mr. Hughes said recently of the city's population count. "Then we can get back to, 'There are eight million stories in the Naked City.' "

HEADLINE: Yes, They Can Get Things Done; 
Council Members Say They're Mightier Than You Think

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

 BODY:
City Councilman Angel Rodriguez of Sunset Park and Red Hook was parked in his wife's Honda Civic, staring excitedly at a pile of junk on the Brooklyn waterfront. Off in the distance, through a chain link fence, he was even more thrilled to see the Statue of Liberty. "There's going to be a park right here!" he said. "Look at this! What do you see right here? The lady in the harbor! I'm making it happen! That's something you can touch! That's tangible! Wow!"
 Up the East River, Councilman Philip Reed of East Harlem had just finished a promising meeting with a developer who might build a home for a school in his district. "If that ain't a success," Mr. Reed said, exhilarated at what he saw as progress, "I'd better get another job. I can see us cutting the ribbon now." 
 And downtown, City Councilwoman Kathryn E. Freed of Lower Manhattan was undergoing a lobbying assault from garbage executives, among them the former state attorney general, Dennis C. Vacco, who wanted the Council to support their plea for higher rates. Ms. Freed was unmoved. "Basically, they've allowed you to come in and do the same kind of predatory pricing that organized crime used to do," she told them, like a disapproving schoolteacher. Afterward, she marveled at the firepower in her office. 
"How the mighty have fallen," she said. "Here's a guy who was attorney general going around lobbying a poor little low-level Council member like me."
In the frantic efforts by the New York City Council to defy voters and repeal its own term limits, the members have had debates suitable for political science textbooks on what their rebellion would mean to governance and the power of the legislature in New York City. Tomorrow there is to be another fiery hearing on the matter at City Hall. 
Lost in the heat, however, are the Council members themselves. Why, if the Council is so powerless -- as many constituents think -- do its members cling to their jobs like life itself? Is it the $90,000-a-year salary? Or something else? As they work under the behemoth shadow of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, what kind of powers do Council members really have? And what do they do all day, besides vent at hearings?
To answer these questions, Ms. Freed, Mr. Reed and Mr. Rodriguez let a reporter tag along with them on their rounds, from hearings to a funeral to meetings with constituents to seemingly constant displays of group outrage in front of television cameras on the City Hall steps. (Give Council members 22 minutes, they'll give you a news conference.) All work very long hours, all say that no one properly appreciates what they do and all unsurprisingly add that they are not among the Council's numerous slug-a-beds and oddballs. The powers of the Council, they agree, are in its ability to negotiate around the edges of the $37 billion city budget, and in its role in occasionally passing crucial legislation -- the city's campaign finance and anti-smoking laws, for example.
The three are as divided as the rest of the Council on term limits: Ms. Freed is a co-sponsor of the bill to repeal them, Mr. Reed is leaning against the repeal and Mr. Rodriguez is undecided. Not incidentally, all have ambitions in this tumultuous local election year for something else: Ms. Freed is running for public advocate and Mr. Reed and Mr. Rodriguez want to be City Council speaker. The Council, they have discovered, is a natural outgrowth of their neighborhood activism that gave them a political base and a springboard to higher office. But more than most jobs, serving on the Council also seems to make them feel needed, connected and strangely alive.

For Community Activist, 'A Logical Place to Be'
"One of the first lessons they teach you is to always say something at a committee hearing so that you can prove you were there," Philip Reed said over a quick sandwich the other day after two tedious Council hearings, the first to create an interagency council on city health services, the other to reaffirm the city's campaign finance laws. He readily admitted that not a whole lot had happened: "You people get bored at what we have to do. Well, I have to sit there and listen to what those people are saying."
Mr. Reed, 52, is acerbic, black, gay, H.I.V.-positive and in a very big hurry. "When you know you don't have forever, you don't want to waste time with stuff," he said. He was elected to the Council in 1997, after 18 months of chemotherapy for multiple myeloma, an aggressive bone-marrow cancer that he still wonders how he survived. 
"Nobody thought I was going to be alive," he said. "When you have to make a new life, because evidently you are going to be here for a while, and you can't survive on disability, you ask yourself, what are you going to do?" To a man who had once been a salesman for Otis Elevator, then in charge of a Brooklyn program for people with H.I.V., the Council was the obvious next step. "If you're a community activist running an AIDS program, you end up lobbying your legislators," he said. "It was a logical place to be."
The powers, he has found, are small but direct: helping to build a new school, helping to create an asthma clinic, holding up Council approval for one project in his district in exchange for concessions from City Hall on another. That first project, a renovation of a city-owned garage and storage center, could not go forward without his approval under the Council's land-use powers. (Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone generally gives individual Council members say over projects that fall in their districts.) Mr. Reed said he would not give in on the storage building until he got what he wanted from City Hall on a community garden and another project that would move a business to East Harlem.
"It isn't small potatoes for the people who live in these districts and you give them hope," Mr. Reed said. "I don't know why people think it has to be some big policy statement about welfare, or that you have to solve the Middle East crisis. This is dealing with people's lives on a day-to-day basis."

'I Had No Idea I Could Do This'
Angel Rodriguez began a recent morning at a funeral for the mother of a constituent, stayed as long as politeness dictated, slipped out, ran into another constituent in the church hallway, told him he had just introduced a bill to name a park after his dead son, then headed for his car and a fast tour of his district. By then it was only 11 a.m.
Don't try to tell him that the New York City Council has no power. "That is nuts," he declared. "You can really get things done." 
To prove his point, he pointed out an elementary school as he sped past. "I met with the principal," Mr. Rodriguez said. "They need computers for the classroom. I went back and negotiated that into the budget. It was $200,000. I mean, that's direct. That's not philosophical, that's not about a broad picture of how you help the city of New York. But government can't solve all of the problems all of the times. But a Council member will go and say, 'I will solve that problem in that case.' And that's really empowering for the Council member. I had no idea I could do this."
Mr. Rodriguez is 43, with an infectious enthusiasm and what he admits is "zero presence" in the corridors of City Hall. "I was elected to serve my district," he said. He grew up partly on welfare, put himself through the College of Staten Island, started his own accounting firm, then dived into his community by coaching sports and starting a nonprofit group that offered computer training in Sunset Park. In 1997, Felix W. Ortiz, the state assemblyman from the 51st District, encouraged Mr. Rodriguez to run for the Council. When he won, he became the first Hispanic to represent a Council district whose boundaries were redrawn for that purpose. 
Now, even though Mr. Rodriguez works twice the hours at half his old salary, his political ambitions have grown. At a news conference at Brooklyn Borough Hall to demand more money for city parks, he made a barely two-minute speech, then politicked among Council candidates, who, if they win, will vote on a successor to Mr. Vallone. "Only 26 votes to be the next speaker," Mr. Rodriguez said.
A half-hour later at his office, a hive of cluttered rooms above a Sunset Park deli, he listened to a constituent's complaints about drivers who revved their car engines next door to his house. The man went on until finally Mr. Rodriguez interjected, "Here's what I'm going to do, and it's not that complicated," promising to call in the drivers to reason with them. The man left beaming.
"We're not curing cancer or anything like that," Mr. Rodriguez said. "And we're not solving all the world's problems. But we may be able to solve that guy's problem. And guess what? To him it's a big deal."

'I'm From the Government And I'm Going to Help You'
 The ubiquitous and often beleaguered Kathryn Freed -- the Council member who represents garment workers in Chinatown, artists in SoHo and Hispanics on the Lower East Side, among many others in the disputatious District 1 -- started one recent day calmly enough with a breakfast given by the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies. She had been invited, like other Council members, to explain her plans to restore social service money cut from the city budget, and even though she arrived a few minutes late, with her ringlets of hair still wet from the shower, she wasted no time at the podium. "Good morning, I'm Kathryn Freed, I'm from the government, and I'm going to help you," she said, to laughter.
From there she jumped on the subway to her office and the meeting with trash executives, left them for a news conference about traffic problems on Canal Street, then walked up to the Brennan Center for Justice on Avenue of the Americas to sign an affidavit in support of the city's campaign finance law, which the mayor is challenging in court. "The year has gotten so sue-y," she said. 
On her way up Avenue of the Americas, she kept up a running commentary on problems that came into her line of sight -- a school that needed more money, a billboard that she was sure was illegal. Was it in fact possible for her to take a walk in her district on a fine spring day and, say, enjoy herself? "No," she said instantly. "You get so used to dealing with this that you can't not notice it."
Ms. Freed is 54, the daughter of a Democratic wardsman in New York. She grew up to drive a cab and then organize SoHo residents when there were just two dozen registered voters in the neighborhood. Before her election to the Council in 1991, she was a lawyer specializing in landlord-tenant disputes. "I took a pay cut and my hours doubled," she said.
But she loves it, in her fashion: "It's like being a religious zealot in the Dark Ages. There's a lot of self-flagellation going on."
Almost from the moment Claritin was approved in 1993, with only five years remaining on its basic patent at the time, Schering-Plough and its competitors began to tussle over the drug's afterlife -- and, more important, when it would begin. Generic drug companies typically gear up to produce a cheap version of a drug about five to seven years before a patent is due to expire. Schering, at that same time, began to mount its expensive legislative campaign to extend Claritin's patent. This fundamental conflict, played out in Congress and in court, is shaping the golden years of Claritin's already eventful career as a drug.
The Claritin patent has been extended several times already, each extension reflecting laws passed by Congress in the last two decades that have modernized the F.D.A. review process and significantly extended the effective life of drug patents. The extensions began with the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, known informally as the Hatch-Waxman Act. Despite its dense legal provisions, Hatch-Waxman is an essential element of any conversation about drug prices in this country. The law was a legislative high-wire act designed to reward innovation at major pharmaceutical companies and protect intellectual property while at the same time promoting lower drug costs, primarily by making it easier for generic drug makers to get to the American marketplace. As part of Hatch-Waxman, new drugs being developed after the law was enacted in 1984 could receive automatic patent extensions of five years. More than 100 drugs, including Claritin, were already in development when the law was passed; these products, known as "pipeline" drugs, were eligible for only two years. That reset the clock for Claritin's patent expiration to the summer of 2000.
In 1994, the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, an obscure addendum to the GATT treaty, added 22 months to the patent life of Claritin, pushing the expiration back to June 2002. And just last August, the basic patent on Claritin was extended yet another six months, to December 2002, because Schering-Plough conducted pediatric trials of the drug. If six months doesn't sound like a lot, consider the economic incentive here: for the price of a modest clinical trial in children (costing at most $3 million), Schering can extend the life of its basic patent half a year and earn close to $1billion. By one unofficial estimate, these three patent extensions will ultimately translate into additional Claritin revenues totaling about $13 billion.
Since 1996, there have been at least a half dozen attempts to extend Claritin's patent life even more. There was an attempt, for instance, in the summer of 2000 to slip language at the last minute into a military-appropriations bill. Schering's lobbying efforts have not been the most persistent, "just the crudest," according to Bruce Downey, C.E.O. of Barr Laboratories, a generic drug maker based in Pomona, N.Y., who has also testified against extending the Claritin patent. 
Representative Waxman has derided the legislation proposed to provide Schering relief as the "Claritin Monopoly Relief Act." But the case for some of the pipeline drugs may not be as outrageous as some critics have suggested. Peter Barton Hutt, the former chief counsel at the F.D.A. and now a lawyer at the Washington firm Covington & Burling, has argued that limiting loratadine and several other pipeline drugs to a two-year extension was "completely arbitrary" and assumed much speedier approval.
As has been true of so much of this drug's history, however, timing is everything, and Schering-Plough's efforts to extend its monopoly has coincided with surging public discontent about the cost of drugs. As a result, each attempt by the company to get Congressional patent relief has become a rallying cry for opponents, including consumer watchdogs, health insurers and generic drug makers. Since the 1996 election, Schering has spent $19.9 million on lobbying and campaign contributions, according to the watchdog group Public Citizen. Yet the most tangible achievement to date of that $20 million lobbying campaign may be the way that it has galvanized the generic drug industry and attracted the attention of lawmakers. Last fall, Senators John McCain and Charles Schumer introduced legislation designed to close loopholes in Hatch-Waxman.
For all the closed-door maneuvering in Washington, an equally revealing pharmaceutical endgame has been playing out, slowly, in a courtroom in New Jersey.
A chilly day in January, about two dozen dark-suited patent attorneys gathered in the United States District Court in Newark, in what has become a typical chain of events toward the end of a prescription drug's life: patent litigation. Unlike the arguments made by Schering-Plough's lobbyists in Washington, however, those made by its lawyers in court documents maintain that Claritin's patent protection extends beyond 2002.
Last August, Teva Pharmaceuticals became the first company to receive tentative approval from the F.D.A. to market a generic version of Claritin. The key word here is "tentative." Teva must wait for the basic loratadine patent to expire next year. It must wait for the resolution of a lawsuit filed against it by Schering, which could conceivably stretch into 2003. And it must wait for Geneva Pharmaceuticals, a generic company based in Broomfield, Colo., to bring its version of Claritin to market; Geneva is entitled to an exclusive 180-day run as the only generic in the market, a monopoly that the company receives as Hatch-Waxman's reward for being the first generic drug maker to challenge a brand drug's patent. The moment the first generic enters the market, industry experts estimate, the cost of generic Claritin will drop to about 80 percent of current prices. When everyone else jumps in six months later, the price will fall off a cliff. "With so many competitors," one generic executive told me, "the price will drop to $10 very quickly."
Generic companies fill about 42 percent of all drug prescriptions in this country, but the price disparity with brand-name drugs is striking. That market share accounted for slightly less than $20 billion in drug sales in 1999; brand company sales accounted for more than $90 billion. Industry advocates claim that if generic sales inched up to 52 percent, American consumers would save an estimated $11 billion a year in drug costs. If the generic industry is beginning to mature, as some maintain, one of the main factors in that process has been, oddly, Schering-Plough. "I think loratadine is one of the first examples," said Dr. Carole Ben-Maimon, head of the Generic Pharmaceutical Industry Association and until recently a vice president at Teva. "We were really able to make it an issue."
Much of the industry's current disgruntlement involves patent litigation -- or as George S. Barrett, president and C.E.O. of Teva USA puts it, "the way the patent system has just been abused." When Congress devised the language of Hatch-Waxman back in 1984, the notion of a drug coming "off patent" was as simple as it sounds: once the patent for a basic compound expired, other companies were free to enter the market. But it's not that simple anymore, said Ben-Maimon, a physician who now heads a research division at Barr.
Brand companies now patent the process of manufacturing the raw material. They patent the medical uses to which the drug can be applied. They patent the formulation of the medicine (the other ingredients used to stabilize the drug). They can patent what's known in the industry as "trade dress" -- the color, size and shape of the pill. They patent metabolites -- the chemicals into which a drug breaks after being metabolized by the human body. 
So drugs don't come "off patent" the way the 1984 law envisioned; they come off as a series of strategically staggered patents, a practice known as layering. And here's where Hatch-Waxman has inadvertently turned into a playbook for complicated, time-consuming -and, according to generic drug makers, frivolous -- patent litigation. 
On Feb. 5, 1998, Geneva Pharmaceuticals filed what's known as an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, seeking F.D.A. permission to sell a generic version of Claritin. Several days later, as obliged by Hatch-Waxman, Geneva notified the patent holder, Schering, of its plans. On March 19, Schering-Plough sued Geneva and its parent corporation, Novartis, claiming that two of its Claritin patents had been infringed. Since then, seven other drug makers -- Zenith Goldline, Teva Pharmaceuticals, Mylan, Andrx, Impax, American Home Products and Apotex-Novex -- have gone to the F.D.A. seeking approval to sell generic versions of Claritin. Although the issues vary from case to case, Schering has sued all of them. 
Some critics make the case that since Hatch-Waxman, an inordinate amount of innovation has been displaced from research to litigation strategies. A lawsuit is far cheaper (about $5million per case) and less risky than research, and the return on investment can be very high. "It's always cheaper to litigate than to lose market share," said a former top-level F.D.A. official who asked not to be named. "If you can keep a generic off the market for one day, three days, five days, two months or two years, that's a lot of revenue. Certainly a lot more than it would cost to pay your lawyers." A Schering spokesman says, "Schering-Plough believes that its patents are valid and enforceable."
William Fletcher, president of Teva North America, knows how frustrating this can be. "You know, people here have asked us several times, 'Why bother doing Claritin?"' he said. "There are going to be at least 10 competitors out there. The price is going to be, you know, 5 percent of Claritin. Why bother doing it? One reason is that we are a broad-line supplier, and we have to have every product in our line. The other reason is that we're just bloody-minded about it, quite frankly. Stubborn. You know, you're damned if you're going to let Schering-Plough get away with it!"
There's a larger game in play in the Newark courtroom, too, according to the generic companies, and it became more interesting a few weeks ago. As Schering-Plough holds the generics at bay with one hand, it had hoped to receive F.D.A. approval in time to introduce desloratadine, its second-generation version of Claritin that will be marketed as Clarinex, this spring. "The longer the litigation is dragged out," says Elliot F. Hahn, president of Andrx, "the more opportunity they have to market desloratadine to physicians and switch them from the Claritin line to the desloratadine line." But that plan ran into a major snag in mid-February, when Schering-Plough revealed that the approval of desloratadine was being held up until the company corrects manufacturing deficiencies cited by the F.D.A. at four of its plants.
What to do in a crisis? Market! Several days later, as the company's stock plunged and attorneys hustled to organize shareholder lawsuits, Schering-Plough announced big new "consumer education" and pharmacy programs for Claritin -- the "largest and most comprehensive allergy initiative of its kind." The company plans to distribute 35 million free drug samples to doctors, 6 million allergy brochures, 65,000 drugstore displays and, yes, 350 million more of those little blue pharmacy bags.
Finally, an edifying case of sticker shock. Late last fall, my allergist prescribed a month's supply of Claritin-D to clear up some congestion before I started my first round of allergy desensitization shots. The pharmacy had misplaced my insurance number, so when I went to pick up the prescription, the clerk handed me a bill for $103. This is the consumer's trickle-down tab for the roughly $250 million in drug development, more than $100 million a year in consumer advertising, many millions in closed-door marketing, $20 million in lobbying and political contributions, $5 million a year for litigation. I was stunned that it was so expensive, and I asked myself a question that is a normal part of every marketplace but health care. If I had to pay $103 out of my own pocket, would I buy this medicine? Was it worth it?
With the exception of elderly people on Medicare and the uninsured, most of us never ask that question. In a recent conversation, Gillian Shepherd, a Manhattan allergy specialist, addressed the same point, noting that antihistamines like Claritin and Allegra are about equal in potency to over-the-counter drugs like Chlor-Trimeton. And while some patients experience sedation with these drugs, many do not. "Fifty percent of the population can tolerate most of them without any sedation," she explained. "The feeling is that if there's a chance of sedation and third parties are paying, why not use the nonsedating drugs? If people were paying out of pocket, the story would be completely different."
As I labored to sort through all the clinical data and all the confusing advertising, I found myself wishing that we had reviewers who would talk bluntly about new drugs, who could discuss efficacy, safety and value from the consumer's point of view, who could deconstruct the advertising, who would include cost as a criterion. But those are medical judgments, some would say, and only doctors should dispense them. True, but many doctors, it turns out, have largely abdicated that responsibility -- they rarely know what a drug costs, and as Shepherd mentioned, many learn about the properties of a given drug not from the medical literature but from company salesmen, who are paid to tell one-sided stories.
And so what? Richard Kogan, Schering's C.E.O., testified before Congress two years ago that drug companies need constant and ample revenue streams to support their enormous and dicey R&D enterprise, and he's right. In order to be competitive in this post-genomic era, large pharmaceutical companies need to spend $2 billion to $4 billion a year on research to develop new drugs. The industry has developed many remarkable medicines, and more are on the way.
But if high drug prices are a kind of innovation tax for American consumers, we should at least demand innovation in return. Many high-priced, successful drugs, like Zyrtec, are developed overseas and simply marketed here by American companies. Moreover, a significant amount of pharmaceutical innovation currently occurs in the biotech sector, where small, cutting-edge companies typically license their discoveries to big pharma, which has the marketing expertise. What innovative new drugs does Schering, for example, have in the pipeline, subsidized by the billions of dollars earned from Claritin? Financial analysts are mixed on the company's potential treatments -- for cancer, asthma, high cholesterol and several other major diseases -- but a leading candidate for future blockbuster status is . . . desloratadine, the chemical that is the principal metabolite, or breakdown product, of Claritin. Anyone who has taken Claritin has already had desloratadine in his or her body.
No one has seen much clinical data on the new drug, but many pharmacologists told me that metabolites rarely possess significantly more potency than their parent compounds, and one allergist confided, not for attribution: "The only reason I can see scientifically for bringing this out is that their patent is about to expire. There have been about 20 abstracts published for desloratadine, all from Schering and all saying there's a little edge here, a little edge there, none of which strike me as terribly important." But then, as the Claritin story makes clear, it's not always about innovation but rather about finding little edges here and there and then marketing the hell out of them. 
Meanwhile, the laboratory of Raymond Woosley of Georgetown University has done research on an over-the-counter antihistamine, Schering's own Chlor-Trimeton -- the same one my father shared with me decades ago. The lab has shown through sophisticated molecular-binding experiments that Chlor-Trimeton is more potent at grabbing and hanging onto the histamine receptor than any other antihistamine it has tested. For several years, the lab has wanted to test a lower -- and possibly nonsedating -- dose of the drug, to no avail. "We did a grant for four years for the N.I.H., and we didn't get it funded," Woosley said. "We assumed the innovator company didn't want to do it because they were making Claritin, and the generic companies didn't want to do it because it would cut into their profit margins even more."
Woosley's study might work; it might not. The issue is that our health-care system has evolved to the point where there is no economic incentive even to try. For an industry that prides itself on taking risk, the risk of discovering that cheaper, older medicines might be just as good, and perhaps even better, than expensive new versions is apparently one risk too great to take.

HEADLINE: Hard Feelings Outlast a 20-Month Strike at Domino 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Bobby Horn should in theory be rejoicing that the 20-month strike at Domino Sugar is finally over, but instead he is so disgusted that last week he joined a group of workers who descended on their union's leaders to give them a piece of their minds. 
 After piling into two minivans that carried them from the immense refinery, on the Brooklyn waterfront, to the union hall several miles south, the 12 angry workers shouted and screamed that while they were mad at the company, they were even madder at their union, the International Longshoremen's Association. "We lost the strike," said Mr. Horn, a mechanic who has worked at Domino for nearly half his 54 years. "Our union didn't support us. They didn't help us in any way." 
 Mr. Horn is angry that the union did not provide strike benefits and did little to rally support from the labor movement. He is also furious that the union's national president, John Bowers, never visited the workers on the picket line in what was one of the longest, hardest fought strikes in New York in decades. 
"I always thought the I.L.A. was a real powerful union," Mr. Horn said. "I guess we all learn."
The Domino dispute was a classic labor standoff, pitting a few hundred tenacious workers, eager to hold on to the benefits and protections they had won over decades, against Tate & Lyle, the multinational company that acquired Domino in 1988 and was intent on cutting costs and workers to keep an aging refinery competitive.
While Mr. Horn and many strikers attribute their loss to the lack of support from their parent union, some labor experts say the die was cast against the strikers from the day the walkout began, June 15, 1999. With few resources other than their own grit, the 286 unionized workers took on a multibillion-dollar corporation not known for backing down in its fights with unions. And the strikers had just one strategist and none of the elaborate war plans that many unions develop before a successful strike.
"They began their strike in a traditional fashion and not thinking through the consequences and without the artillery to back it up," said Greg Tarpinian, president of Labor Research Associates, a New York consulting group. "Some fights are lost the day they begin because of the balance of forces. Valiance is important but it does not always mean victory."
Leaders of the national longshoremen's union, meanwhile, insist that they did everything they could to help. A spokesman, Jim McNamara, said the union "offered financial support throughout the months and years." But the strikers said the parent union contributed only about $200,000 to support the strikers, who each lost an average of $50,000 in wages. 
The contract that the workers ultimately approved, 56 to 48, was not much different from one that workers overwhelmingly rejected just before the strike started. It weakens seniority rights, reduces the number of holidays and sick days and gives management the freedom to contract out work and cut the work force by 110 people, or two-fifths. 
With his black leather jacket, silver earring and distant, smoldering gaze, Mr. Horn could be a character out of a Bruce Springsteen song on the tribulations of blue-collar America. The refinery's locale, just north of the Williamsburg Bridge, is definitely Springsteen territory. A century ago it was a thriving manufacturing area, but today it is marked by garbage-strewn lots and deserted factories. One of the few exceptions is the 143-year-old sugar refinery, a gloomy, dark-brick building that seems like a dinosaur that escaped extinction.
Mr. Horn, who earns almost $19 an hour, is filled with bitter memories of the strike: of picketing in biting winter winds that whipped off the water, of watching dozens of co-workers stream across the picket line nine months after the walkout began, of Domino security guards filming his every move while picketing. 
But he was not always bitter. He remembers the strike's heady early months when not one of the 286 union members crossed the picket line. The strikers, who included immigrants from Egypt, Italy, Poland and Yugoslavia, and blacks from the South and the Caribbean, likened themselves to a successful United Nations of workers who knew how to stick together.
"It felt good -- as long as we stuck together," Mr. Horn said. "But then people started crossing, and that started the downfall."
Some who crossed said they did so because their unemployment insurance had run out and they had families to support. Others said the walkout seemed to be going nowhere. 
Mr Horn says the 104 workers who abandoned the strike and crossed the picket line betrayed the cause. "I'm probably never going to talk to them again, although a lot of them were my friends," he said. "If they didn't cross the line, this dispute might have been over a long time ago. We might have been able to get what we want."
Although Mr. Horn, with his children grown and his mortgage paid off, was in better financial shape than most others, he still felt the pinch. Soon after the strike began, he stopped using his cell phone and took a part-time, $12-an-hour job driving a truck at night. 
His biggest financial crisis came when the transmission on his Chevy Suburban gave out and to fix it he had to get $1,000 from a $140,000 emergency fund the New York City Central Labor Council had set up to aid the Domino workers.
Two others who remained on strike, Cheryl Boodie and Mary Lou Fenice, had a harder time. Ms. Boodie, a refinery worker, received welfare benefits for her 8-year-old daughter. Ms. Fenice, a machinery attendant, took a $5.75-an-hour job as a supermarket cashier to help put her 18-year-old daughter through Baruch College. "It's not fun," Ms. Fenice said. "You try to cut back as much as you can, but it's hard. Our rent is $600, and then you do a week's worth of shopping, and suddenly the money is gone."
Day after day during the strike, Mr. Horn went to the union's trailer, alongside the refinery's eastern wall, to shoot the breeze and to strategize.
He was touched by the truckers who stopped by to drop off coffee and doughnuts. The high point, he said, came when burly drivers from Teamsters Local 282 showed up for rallies and refused to deliver the cement that Domino needed to build two storage tanks. "We got more support from Local 282 than from our own union," Mr. Horn said.
If the strike had a leader, it was Joe Crimi, vice president of the sugar division of the longshoremen's Local 1814. He oversaw negotiations with Tate & Lyle and was the lone strategist, morale booster, social worker, coffee buyer and communications director.
Mr. Crimi said he knew it would be hard to take on Tate & Lyle. In a much-publicized battle that lasted from 1993 to 1995, its Staley subsidiary wore down the union after locking out 750 workers for 30 months at a corn sweetener plant in Decatur, Ill. 
Mr. Crimi said he agreed with Mr. Horn that the Domino workers could have won the strike if the national A.F.L.-C.I.O and the longshoremen's union had done much more; for example, if they had sent thousands of people to rallies and called for a nationwide boycott of Domino Sugar. The largest Domino rally attracted just 300 people, and members of a different union representing workers at other Domino refineries vetoed a boycott because they saw the strike as a lost cause.
"The labor movement as a whole, from John Sweeney on down, was at fault because if they had provided some hope, all these members would not have crossed the picket line," Mr. Crimi said. "The people who stayed out were diehard, courageous union members. They deserved better."
But Mr. Tarpinian, the independent labor consultant, said that even if the longshoremen's union and the A.F.L.-C.I.O. had given far more support, it might not have ensured victory for the strikers. "They are understandably bitter," he said. "They fought the good fight and lost."
Mr. Horn said the workers had no choice but to strike because of what he viewed as Domino's nonstop demands for givebacks. After a five-and-a-half month strike in 1995, he said, Tate & Lyle eliminated one of the prize benefits provided by Domino's previous owner: a seven-week sabbatical every five years. 
"I fought for 25 years to get a lot of these things, and I didn't want them taking all that away from us," Mr. Horn said. 
Margaret Blamberg, a Tate & Lyle spokeswoman, said the company's objective throughout the dispute was to hold down costs and increase operating flexibility at a time when sweetener prices, and thus profits, were down. She said the company was in no way seeking to break the union.
When the strike began, Mr. Horn said, he had no idea that it would last so long or turn out so badly. "We knew we were taking on deep pockets," he said, "but we stood up for what we thought was right."

HEADLINE: German Group Buys Stake In Skyscraper 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
A German investment group has bought a 75 percent stake in the Chrysler Building, the landmark Art Deco tower at Lexington Avenue and 42nd Street, for $300 million, according to real estate executives.
 The investment group, TMW, can now claim a hold on a 77-story skyscraper with an internationally recognized profile. But the current owners, Tishman Speyer Properties and Travelers Group, will retain control of the tower and the adjoining 32-story Chrysler East building. 
 The Chrysler Building is one of several trophy Manhattan real estate properties that have been on the auction block in the past year, including Rockefeller Center and the Citigroup Center. In the largest deal of its kind, Vornado Realty Trust is negotiating to buy control of the 110-story Twin Towers and the World Trade Center from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in a $3.25 billion deal.
But the recent sales deals have come at a time when a pessimistic wind is blowing through the real estate industry. Developers and landlords are worried that the decline in the stock market, an economic slowdown and layoffs will bring an end to skyrocketing rents for office buildings and apartments.
"People are more cautious today," said Jonathan L. Mechanic, a real estate lawyer at Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobsen. "But deals are still getting done because there's a low vacancy rate and companies that need space."
An executive who had been briefed on the Chrysler deal but insisted that his name not be used called it "financial engineering."
"Tishman Speyer will maintain a controlling interest and full decision-making authority over the asset," the executive said. Jerry I. Speyer and his company, Tishman Speyer, will still manage the buildings.
Under the terms of the deal, the 1.2-million-square-foot Chrysler Building is valued at $400 million. The smaller tower, once known as the Kent Building, is valued at about $300 million. The two buildings underwent a remarkable $100 million transformation in recent years.
Tishman Speyer and Travelers Group put the properties on the auction block last year, hoping to get as much as $800 million. But Mr. Speyer was reluctant to let go of the landmark, which the partners acquired in 1997 for about $220 million. So when the bids fell short, the two partners decided to seek an alternative.
Last year, Mr. Speyer and TMW bought the 39-story, 1.3-million-square-foot building at 666 Fifth Avenue and 52nd Street. TMW, in turn, sells the investments to syndicates of German institutions.
In December, Vornado lost out on Rockefeller Center, when Mr. Speyer and the Crown family of Chicago agreed to buy the landmark in a $1.85 billion deal.

A Top Coke Official Resigns Amid a Broad Revamping
As part of its continued efforts to revive its beverage business, Coca-Cola announced a series of sweeping management changes, including the resignation Jack L. Stahl, the president and chief operating officer.
 The changes create four business units -- Americas, Asia, Europe/Africa and New Business Ventures -- with the head of each reporting directly to Coke's chairman and chief executive, Douglas Daft. The new structure will eliminate the jobs of chief operating officer and president. Page C2. 

Hyundai Unit Is Declared Bankrupt
Hyundai Group of South Korea suffered another blow when the Korea Exchange Bank said that one of the group's subsidiaries, Korea Industrial Development, was bankrupt. C2.

Ownership Debate in Public Radio
A dispute over proprietorship and revenue splits has deprived "The Connection," a radio talk show owned by WBUR-FM in Boston of its longtime host, Christopher Lydon. Mr. Lydon and his senior producer wanted to own equity in the show that they developed. Negotiations broke down and the two were suspended for "insubordination" and will not return. The debate raises questions about who owns public radio programs and who should profit from them. The arguments are being played out on the show's Web site and in the comments of other radio show hosts like Diane Rehm, above, whose talk show in Washington competes with "The Connection." "The mission of public radio has never been to make money," she said. C12.

Critical Path Calls Problems Limited
The new management of Critical Path, an Internet software company, said that the questionable accounting practices that damaged its reputation were largely confined to its fourth-quarter United States sales. C13.

Companies Slow to Purchase Online
Even those who were once most bullish on the new economy expected businesses to hesitate in moving their corporate purchasing operations online -- no matter how sweet the promises of cost savings. But a new report suggests that companies are moving more slowly than any but the true skeptics might have predicted. Bob Tedeschi: E-Commerce Report. C11.

Taking Circuits Off the Clock
Ivan Sutherland of Sun Microsystems and his team are pursuing a radically different approach to the design of circuits, using a technique in which the switching on and off of digital circuits is controlled by specific pieces of data rather than by a clock that forces the millions of the circuits on a chip to march in unison. Clockless computing, according to its proponents, would offer greater computational speed and lower power consumption, as well as making it possible to design new chips more quickly. C5.

HEADLINE: A Narrow Energy Bill 

 BODY:
Give Senator Frank Murkowski this much. He has offered the first major bill in a decade aimed at overhauling the country's energy policies. But the Alaska Republican's 300-page measure is not by any stretch a blueprint for a measured policy that balances responsible development with energy conservation. Despite some nods toward energy efficiency, it is essentially an oil driller's bill. The larger danger is that it could serve as a template for the cabinet-level task force appointed by President Bush to devise a comprehensive national energy strategy. That panel, which is led by Vice President Dick Cheney, an oilman himself, is already disposed to honor Mr. Bush's campaign pledge to sweep away regulatory impediments to new exploration. If the panel endorses Mr. Murkowski's approach, environmentalists and their Congressional allies should be ready for a protracted and difficult struggle on Capitol Hill. 
 Mr. Murkowski's stated purpose is to reduce the nation's use of foreign oil from 56 percent to 50 percent, partly through tax breaks for the oil and gas companies but mainly by opening up more tracts of land for exploration. The bill also includes an array of incentives aimed at encouraging cleaner fuels and alternative fuel sources like wind power, as well as rewarding consumers who buy super-efficient cars and appliances. But these provisions, some of which appeal strongly to environmentalists, are secondary to the main thrust of the bill, which is to increase production. The centerpiece of that strategy, in turn, is to open up the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for exploration. 
 This page has addressed the folly of trespassing on a wondrous wildlife preserve for what, by official estimates, is likely to be a modest amount of economically recoverable oil. A majority of Mr. Murkowski's colleagues seem to share these doubts. Barring a radical change in sentiment, any measure that seeks to open the refuge to drilling will probably fail in an up-or-down vote in the House and, in the unlikely event that it succeeds there, will not survive a Senate filibuster promised by Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts.
But there are other unsettling aspects of the bill that could survive and, at the very least, could infect the thinking of the White House task force. One of these would transfer to the states the federal government's supervisory authority over drilling operations on federal land. Mr. Murkowski says this is merely an efficiency move. But conservationists fear that once operational control passes to state oil and gas commissions, environmental values like water quality and the protection of fish and wildlife will inevitably be subordinated.
What is especially annoying about this provision is that it is based on the premise, assiduously cultivated by the Bush campaign, that environmental concerns have inhibited exploration on America's public lands. For the most part, they have not. In the so-called overthrust belt in the Rocky Mountain states, only 5 percent of 116 million acres of land managed by the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management -- containing a mere 2 percent of the lower 48's natural gas reserves -- are off limits, either as wilderness or national monuments. The environmentalists are merely asking that the job of safeguarding the millions of acres that are open to development not be transferred to notoriously indifferent state agencies.
A second worrisome section is a provision that would provide $1 billion for "clean coal" technology, which is aimed at making coal -- the most plentiful but dirtiest of all fossil fuels -- more acceptable environmentally. Washington has already spent $6 billion on clean-coal research. The bill not only would dump an additional $1 billion into an admittedly uncertain technology, but also would temporarily relieve any company investing in such technology from compliance with an important component of the Clean Air Act. 
The bill has other problems, but these two alone suggest that it is a bill that will inspire more argument than enlightenment. And enlightenment on energy is what America needs most.

HEADLINE: Elder Bush in Big G.O.P. Cast Toiling for Top Equity Firm 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE WAYNE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
During the presidential campaign last year, former President George Bush took time off from his son's race to call on Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia at a luxurious desert compound outside Riyadh to talk about American-Saudi business affairs.
 Mr. Bush went as an ambassador of sorts, but not for his government. In the same way, Mr. Bush's secretary of state, James A. Baker III, recently met with a group of wealthy people at the elegant Lanesborough Hotel in London to explain the Florida vote count. 
 Traveling with the fanfare of dignitaries, Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker were using their extensive government contacts to further their business interests as representatives of the Carlyle Group, a $12 billion private equity firm based in Washington that has parlayed a roster of former top-level government officials, largely from the Bush and Reagan administrations, into a moneymaking machine. 
In a new spin on Washington's revolving door between business and government, where lobbying by former officials is restricted but soliciting investments is not, Carlyle has upped the ante and taken the practice global. Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker were accompanied on their trips by former Prime Minister John Major of Britain, another of Carlyle's political stars. With door-openers of this caliber, along with shrewd investment skills, Carlyle has gone from an unknown in the world of private equity to one of its biggest players. Private equity, which involves buying up companies in private deals and reselling them, is a high-end business open only to the very rich.
Over the last decade, the Carlyle empire has grown to span three continents and include investments in most corners of the world. It owns so many companies that it is now in effect one of the nation's biggest defense contractors and a force in global telecommunications. Its blue-chip investors include major banks and insurance companies, billion-dollar pension funds and wealthy investors from Abu Dhabi to Singapore.
In getting business for Carlyle, Mr. Bush has been impressive. His meeting with the crown prince was followed by a yacht cruise and private dinners with Saudi officials, including King Fahd, all on behalf of Carlyle, which has extensive interests in the Middle East.
And Mr. Bush led Carlyle's successful entry into South Korea, the fastest-growing economy in Asia. After his meetings with the prime minister and other government and business leaders, Carlyle won a tough competition for control of KorAm, one of Korea's few healthy banks.
The steady flow of politicians to lucrative private-sector jobs based on their government contacts is a familiar Washington tale. But in this case, it is being played out for more dollars, on a global stage, and in the world of private finance, where the minimal government rules prohibiting lobbying by former officials for a given period are not a factor. These rules say nothing about potential conflicts when former government officials use their connections and insights for financial gain, and they may attract more notice now that George W. Bush is president. Many of those involved with Carlyle, which invests largely in companies that do business with the government or are affected by government regulations, have ties to the Oval Office.
For instance, Frank C. Carlucci, a Reagan secretary of defense who as much as anyone is responsible for Carlyle's success, said he met in February with his old college classmate Donald H. Rumsfeld, the secretary of defense, and Vice President Dick Cheney, himself a defense secretary under former President Bush, to talk about military matters -- at a time when Carlyle has several billion-dollar defense projects under consideration. 
Carlyle officials contend that the firm's activities do not present any potential conflicts since Mr. Bush, Mr. Baker and other former Republican officials now at Carlyle -- including Mr. Carlucci, who is Carlyle's chairman, and Richard G. Darman, Mr. Bush's former budget director -- do not lobby the federal government. Carlyle executives point out that many corporations have former government officials as board members.
"Mr. Bush gives us no advice on what do with with the federal government," said David Rubenstein, the firm's founder and a former aide in the Carter White House. "We've gone over backwards to make sure that we do no lobbying."
Others, however, see little difference between potential conflicts involving lobbying and those involving investments. 
"Carlyle is as deeply wired into the current administration as they can possibly be," said Charles Lewis, executive director of the Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit public interest group based in Washington. "George Bush is getting money from private interests that have business before the government, while his son is president. And, in a really peculiar way, George W. Bush could, some day, benefit financially from his own administration's decisions, through his father's investments. The average American doesn't know that and, to me, that's a jaw-dropper."
It is difficult to determine exactly how much money the senior Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker have made. Mr. Baker is a Carlyle partner, and Mr. Bush has the title senior adviser to its Asian activities. With a current market value of about $3.5 billion on Carlyle's equity and with the firm owned by 18 partners and one outside investor, Mr. Baker's Carlyle stake would be worth about $180 million if each partner held an equal stake. It is not known whether he has more or less than the other partners.
Unlike Mr. Baker, Mr. Bush has no ownership stake in Carlyle; he is an adviser and an investor and is compensated by obtaining stakes in Carlyle investments. Carlyle executives cited, for example, Mr. Bush's being allowed to put money he earns giving speeches for Carlyle into its investment funds. Mr. Bush generally receives $80,000 to $100,000 for a speech. He sits on no corporate boards other than Carlyle's. 
Carlyle also gave the Bush family a hand in 1990 by putting George W. Bush, who was then struggling to find a career, on the board of a Carlyle subsidiary, Caterair, an airline-catering company. 
From Carlyle's point of view, the involvement of Mr. Baker and the former president is invaluable.
"It punches up the brand awareness for us globally," said Daniel A. D'Aniello, a Carlyle managing director. "We are greatly assisted by Baker and Bush. It shows that we are associated with people of the highest ethical standards."
With $12 billion from investors, Carlyle claims to be the nation's largest private equity fund and makes money by investing in undervalued companies and reselling at a profit. These numbers put Carlyle in the same league as better-known private equity firms like Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company and Forstmann-Little & Company.
Two hundred forty Carlyle employees are stationed throughout the world either raising money or finding ways to spend it. Carlyle has ownership stakes in 164 companies, which last year employed more than 70,000 people and generated $16 billion in revenues. About 450 institutions -- mainly large pension funds and banks -- are Carlyle investors.
The California state pension fund invested $305 million with Carlyle, and the Texas teachers pension fund -- whose board was appointed when George W. Bush was governor -- gave Carlyle $100 million to invest in November. Carlyle also works as a financial adviser to the Saudi government.
"Let's say Carlyle is going fund-raising in the Middle East and they bring Bush along," said David Snow, editor of Private Equity Central, a trade publication. "He led the U.S. Army into that region. That will catch the attention of very wealthy investors in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. The fact that Bush is involved doesn't mean that Carlyle will make great investment decisions. But it will get them access to certain deals and certain countries that they might otherwise not have."
One former Carlyle employee said, "The firm understands that having Bush and Major around is like having movie stars around." 
Yet Carlyle's success is not just because of its high-powered connections. Carlyle has done well for its investors, returning an average of 34 percent a year over the last decade, in line with other private equity funds. It has done this by buying what it knows best -- companies that are regulated by the government. Nearly two-thirds of its investments are in defense and telecommunications companies, which are affected by shifts in government spending and policy. 
Carlyle has become the nation's 11th largest defense contractor, owning companies that make tanks, aircraft wings and a broad array of other military equipment. It also owns health care companies, real estate, Internet companies, a bottling company and even Le Figaro, the French newspaper. 
"Carlyle is one of the most successful fund-raising groups," said Mario L. Giannini, president of Hamilton Lane, a Philadelphia consultant to institutional investors. "They have tremendous access and they have done very well with their money."
And its access extends well beyond American shores. In Europe, Carlyle has assembled an advisory board that besides Mr. Major includes Karl Otto Pohl, former president of German's Bundesbank, and the past or present chairmen of B.M.W., Hoffman-LaRoche, Nestle, LVMH-Moet Hennessy, Louis Vuitton and Aerospatiale, the French Airbus partner.
Carlyle's Asia advisory board, which helps raise money and finds and reviews deals, includes former President Fidel V. Ramos of the Philippines, the former prime minister of Thailand and the executive director of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority. The former South Korean prime minister Park Tae Joon was also an adviser to Carlyle. 
This star power is a source of great pride for Carlyle and part of an acknowledged long-term strategy to associate the firm with brand-name politicians and business executives in order to attract more of the same -- along with their money, insights and connections. That said, Carlyle partners bristle at any suggestion that the firm's success is based only on high-powered schmoozing.
"If our track record was not good, people would not invest with us," said Mr. Rubenstein, the founding partner. "No one would gives us money just because Mr. Bush is one of our advisers."
On that point, others agree. "People took potshots at Carlyle early on and tried to denigrate their investment credentials because they had all these government officials over there," said Bernard Aronson, managing partner at ACON Investments, a private equity firm in Washington. "But that's sort of a myth. The all-hat-and-no-cattle has disappeared because they performed consistently, delivered excellent returns and have become global players."
One of the people who put Carlyle on the map -- developing its riches and its image -- is Mr. Carlucci, who joined the firm in 1989 when it had engaged in a string of ill-fated ventures. He is credited with steering Carlyle into successful defense industry acquisitions -- just when other investors were shunning them -- and with using his seat on more than a dozen corporate boards to bring Carlyle deals and investors.
In an office adorned with photographs of Mr. Carlucci and the politically mighty -- he sits beneath an Oval Office picture of himself and Mr. Reagan -- Mr. Carlucci makes it clear that his extensive government and global ties are as fresh as ever.
"I know Rumsfeld extremely well," Mr. Carlucci said in an interview. "We've been close friends throughout the years. We were college classmates."
Pointing to a picture of the Chinese president, he said, "There's a photo of me and Jiang Zemin. And there's me and the president of Taiwan." 
Right now, Carlyle is hoping that financing is provided for the $13.7 billion Crusader program. The Crusader is a heavy-duty tank made by a Carlyle portfolio company and other contractors. And Carlyle just lodged a complaint with the government after another of its portfolio companies lost a $4 billion contract to build a lightweight combat vehicle. 
While Mr. Carlucci is open about his discussions with Mr. Rumsfeld on Pentagon policies, he said he never lobbies. "I've made it clear that I don't lobby the defense industry," Mr. Carlucci said. "I will give our Carlyle bankers advice on what they might do and who they should talk to. But I do not pick up the phone and say you should fund X, Y or Z."
If Washington's revolving door brought Republicans to Carlyle during the Clinton presidency, now the firm is preparing for an onslaught of Democrats. The day these interviews took place at Carlyle's Washington office, Gene Sperling, one of the Clinton administration's top economic advisers, was in for a job interview.

 CORRECTION:
An article on March 5 about the involvement of former President George Bush and other leading Republicans in the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm based in Washington, referred incorrectly to a cruise and dinners Mr. Bush attended in Saudi Arabia last year. Neither King Fahd nor any Saudi officials participated in those events, which were arranged by local Saudi businessmen.

Bush Is Pushing Hard For Support on Tax Cuts
President Bush and his aides are mounting an all-out campaign to press conservative and moderate Democrats to break with their party and support his $1.6 trillion tax cut plan. Mr. Bush, determined to win the centerpiece of his agenda and the defining struggle of his young presidency, has gone on the road to sell his tax cut, which faces a bitterly divided Congress. He has turned almost every trip into a none-too-subtle lobbying expedition with one or more undecided or politically vulnerable lawmakers in mind. A1

Huge Storm Makes Its Way Along Northeast Coast
A powerful late-winter storm that forecasters had been tracking for days roared up the Atlantic Coast on cue and began battering the New York region and the rest of the Northeast with what was expected to be a two-day, two-round assault of snow, sleet, high winds, flooding and more snow today and tomorrow.

A Bigger Big Apple?
Planners for New York City are cautiously anticipating that the city's population count in the 2000 census will turn out significantly higher than estimates suggest. One reason for their optimism is that they were allowed, for the first time, to update the address list the Census Bureau used for the count, and persuaded the bureau to add 370,000 households that the city says were missing, the equivalent of a medium-size city.

HEADLINE: Can Aristide Govern in Haiti? 

BYLINE:  By Garry Pierre-Pierre; Garry Pierre-Pierre, a former reporter with The New York Times, is editor and publisher of Haitian Times in Brooklyn.

 BODY:
When President Jean-Bertrand Aristide took over Haiti last month, he was a different man from the popular priest who swept into office only a decade ago. Mr. Aristide is not the only one who has changed. The country has descended deeper into poverty, and Mr. Aristide, who was never popular with the moneyed elite, has also managed to turn some of his staunchest allies -- the intellectual left -- into bitter enemies. They have vowed to make his five-year term difficult, if not impossible. But if Mr. Aristide is to be successful, he must find a way to please groups with seemingly conflicting interests, and his tenure will be defined by how well he manages to appease Haitians living abroad, foreign leaders and the Haitian elite.
 Haitians outside the country are perhaps the easiest, most loyal and least demanding of these groups. Numbering about two million across the United States, Canada, France and the Dominican Republic, this scattered group has always been rooting for a better Haiti and has never turned its back on the country, regardless of the despot du jour. Haitian-Americans alone send back close to $300 million to Haiti every year. 
 Haitians overseas could contribute still more if Mr. Aristide could curtail the security problems plaguing Haiti. In recent years, many Haitians living abroad have been reluctant to go home because of numberless stories about armed robberies, killings and rapes. They have been patiently awaiting action on their wishes for dual citizenship, arguing that their economic contributions should be coupled with the right to vote and participate more fully in Haiti's future. Many other countries, including the neighboring Dominican Republic, have granted this sort of franchise to lure much needed human and financial resources.
As in 1990, when he won an overwhelming victory, Aristide has not been embraced by Washington. President Bush sent no one to his inauguration last month. The United States and other nations have withheld some $500 million in aid to protest last year's tainted legislative elections, in which Mr. Aristide's Lavalas party won more than 90 percent of the vote, giving it a virtual lock on Parliament. Suspicions abound between Port-au-Prince and Washington. Mr. Aristide was overthrown in 1991, during the tenure of President Bush's father; many of the people who ran Washington then are back in power and have little tolerance for Mr. Aristide.
Part of the suspicion on the American side comes from Mr. Aristide's having reneged on accords he signed in the past. For instance, his government signed a structural adjustment package that was to privatize some key state industries as part of the deal that brought him back to Haiti in 1994. Less than a year later, Mr. Aristide, uncomfortable with handing over state-run enterprises -- repositories of political patronage -- waged a public campaign to undermine the process. To this day, the telephone company, port and airport, the jewels of the package, have not been privatized.
Bill Clinton, having secured an early political success in helping to oust a military junta in Haiti, was tolerant of Mr. Aristide. Last December, President Clinton sent Anthony Lake, his former national security adviser, to meet with Mr. Aristide and offer him a way out of his international political difficulties. As a result of that meeting, Mr. Aristide came up with an eight-point plan, mainly made up of democracy-building measures that, if put into place, would garner him some credibility with the Bush administration.
So far, there are signs that Mr. Aristide is following through on some of his promises. Six of the 10 senators who gained their seats in the controversial elections last May have said they are willing to relinquish their offices and run again. Mr. Aristide has taken steps to create a new electoral council -- a body that organizes elections -- to replace the dubious provisional body used last year. These are concrete actions that Secretary of State Colin Powell has recently said he wanted to see before meaningful dialogue could take place. Mr. Powell has also stated that strengthening Haiti's moribund democracy is one of the administration's priorities. Mr. Aristide needs to continue to show Washington that he is serious about changes.
But Mr. Aristide already has his hands full with his Haitian opponents. On the day Mr. Aristide was being sworn in, the opposition inaugurated its own president, Gerard Gourgue, a respected human rights lawyer and educator. What the opposition wants is for Mr. Aristide to step down and organize new elections, something that no one believes will actually happen. In the past, it was easy to dismiss opposition parties as right-wing zealots. This new bunch, however, includes the very same people who, a decade ago, orchestrated Mr. Aristide's rise to power.
But the opposition has not played smart. Its so-called alternative government has been ridiculed, has failed to offer a true alternative to Mr. Aristide and has no popular mandate. Still, the opposition can inflict political damage and create gridlock. Things looked so much more promising in 1991, before a coup aborted Mr. Aristide's tenure. It will take a superhuman effort for Mr. Aristide, once affectionately called "Titid," to lead a peaceful Haiti. While the Americans and the people of the Haitian diaspora may help him, the opposition will not.

HEADLINE: Bush's Tax Plan Just Needs Tweaking 

BYLINE:  By Robert M. Dunn Jr.; Robert M. Dunn Jr. is a professor of economics at George Washington University.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Despite constant criticism since it was first suggested during the presidential campaign, President Bush's planned tax reduction is not excessively large or tipped outrageously toward the well-off. It would make sense to alter some details of the tax cut in his new budget, but overall it is of about the right size and distribution -- not so big as to be dangerous, yet fair to all income groups.
 Federal tax revenues (from all taxes, including those not addressed in this tax cut) are now at a peacetime record high as a share of America's gross domestic product and are within half a percentage point of the 1944 wartime record. The share of G.D.P. going to federal taxes increased by 2.9 percentage points during Bill Clinton's presidency. With no war (hot or cold) in progress, there is no reason for Americans to be paying so much of their income in federal taxes. 
 Critics of the Bush proposal contend that, even for the well-off, American tax rates are actually quite low. That claim is nonsense. A family in which the husband and wife each earn $84,000 in taxable income faces a statutory federal marginal rate of 36 percent, but that rate does not include a phase-out of deductions and exemptions, introduced by the elder President Bush and made permanent by President Clinton in 1993. Nor does it reflect an uncapped Medicare tax of 2.9 percent. The actual federal marginal rate facing this family is 40 percent, plus whatever is taken by the state or locality. If the family lives in New York, Massachusetts or California, where local income taxes are high, its marginal tax rate is close to 50 percent.
Critics claim that such a family is so wealthy that it can easily afford such taxes. With $168,000 in income, a husband and wife like this would have a luxurious standard of living in Arkansas or Tennessee, but not in New York City, Boston or Washington. In San Francisco they would be very far from wealthy.
Opponents also say the Bush plan is just too big. But when fully phased in, the tax cut will represent 1.5 percent of gross domestic product, which is about half the tax increase of the Clinton era. The Kennedy-Johnson tax cut of 1964 was 1.6 percent of G.D.P. Ronald Reagan's 1981 tax cut, at 2.5 percent of G.D.P., was too big, leading to deficits, in part because it came at a time when the United States was rebuilding its military strength as part of a worsening cold war.
Some commentators and politicians say most Americans don't care about a tax cut, so why pursue it? The indifference reflected in public opinion polls is understandable; the bottom 50 percent of taxpayers are responsible for only 4.2 percent of these revenues, so why should they care about a tax cut? But a sizable group does care. Because of the extreme progressivity of Mr. Clinton's 1993 tax law, 5 percent of the Americans who file tax returns provide 52 percent of all federal personal income tax revenues.
The current structure of tax rates means that a small minority of families pay the overwhelming majority of federal income taxes, while most Americans pay very little. When the federal government is running a large budget surplus, there is no reason for the imposition of punishing marginal tax rates on American families that are prosperous but not rolling in cash.
All of this is not to say that the Bush proposal is perfect. It does contain some provisions that Congress could reasonably change.
First, in an attempt to simplify the rate structure, the Bush proposal reduces some upper rates by more than the cuts for lower incomes. Family incomes over $297,000 get a cut of 6.6 percentage points while incomes between $166,000 and $297,000 get a cut of only three points.
The same pattern is repeated for lower incomes. From $109,000 to $166,000 the cut is six percentage points, but from $45,000 to $109,000 it is only three points.
Incomes from $12,000 to $45,000 get no reduction, while incomes below $12,000 get five points.
Congress could do better by simply reducing all tax rates by three percentage points, except in the bottom bracket, which should retain a five-point cut. 
Second, the full elimination of death taxes is probably excessive. Bill Gates and George Soros say that they like this tax, and for them it is a fine idea. There is no reason to eliminate estate taxes on the super-rich. Merely doubling the minimum amount at which the tax begins, which is now $675,000, and then reducing the top rates from 50 and 55 percent to more modest levels would be sufficient. The families of Bill Gates and his Silicon Valley colleagues can still feel noble about giving up some of their enormous wealth.
Both of these changes in the Bush proposal would reduce the size of the tax loss, lessening any threat to the budget surplus.
With these and perhaps a few other modest changes, the Bush tax proposal is perfectly reasonable. Ongoing surpluses mean the country can afford it, and excessively high current marginal tax rates suggest that it is fair. And if it is passed quickly enough, it might even forestall a recession.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS; 
Prices of Treasuries Fall Slightly

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices fell slightly yesterday as stocks rose and with a wave of new corporate supply scheduled to come to market this week.
 Dealers said most market participants were in a holding pattern, watching stocks and waiting for economic reports, expected later this week, that could give clues on how much the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates and how soon. 
 A snowstorm forecast for the New York City area was also seen as a cause of thin trading.
A debt sale from France Telecom is expected this week. At up to $15.8 billion, it could become one of the largest corporate bond sales ever. Treasuries felt the pressure from this upcoming deal as investors sold government bonds to buy new, higher-yielding debt.
The 10-year Treasury note fell 8/32 , to a price of 100 7/32 . The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.97 percent from 4.94 percent on Friday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 3/32 , to 100 1/32 . The bond's yield was unchanged at 5.37 percent.

HEADLINE: How to Say No To a Sultan; 
Brunei and Its Leader Try Economic Discipline

BYLINE:  By WAYNE ARNOLD 

DATELINE: BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Brunei 

 BODY:
There is probably no better vantage point on the changes creeping across this oil-drenched sultanate than astride one of the sleek, powerful horses at the Jerudong Park Polo Club.
 Not long ago, the club's 200 imported Argentine ponies, immaculate fields and opulent clubhouse were restricted to family and guests of Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah. Now, in what this country has declared Visit Brunei Year, anyone can ride for as little as $20. 
 The open-stable policy, though, is far more than equestrian outreach. The club was built in a decade of royal extravagance that, coupled with the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and 1998, devastated Brunei's wealth and helped push its economy into a recession from which it has yet to fully recover. 
In response, Brunei's multibillionaire monarch has assumed the unlikely role of economic disciplinarian, trying to drag his sleepy, conservative Muslim enclave into the global economy. Selling pony rides is part of a larger effort to refill the coffers, lure tourists and investors, and wean Brunei from a long overdependence on oil and government money.
"We have to be more competitive," said Wahab Juned, director general of the Economic Council Secretariat, whose 12 members were appointed by the sultan to draft an economic blueprint. "We need to create jobs."
Skepticism over Brunei's efforts abounds. Brunei has been vowing to diversify its economy since the mid-1980's, but reductions in the dominance of oil have been achieved largely by raising government outlays. Surging oil prices have taken some of the urgency out of the reform drive. But while the sultan's planners have honed their free-market vocabulary, few are willing to discuss how economic liberalization might reduce the dominance of a man most will refer to only as "His Majesty."
"What Brunei needs now is transparency and accountability in the government," said Hatta Zainal Abidin, president of the Solidarity National Party, the country's only legal political opposition group.
The sultan's family has been ruling this part of Borneo for six centuries, gradually ceding territory to what is now Malaysia to the point that modern Brunei's roughly 300,000 people live in an area the size of Delaware. Brunei is so small that it has no central bank, instead pegging its currency to Singapore's. The capital remains a quaint backwater, where most women cover their heads, buildings rise no higher than the central mosque and alcohol is banned.
The discovery of oil here in 1929 clinched Brunei's fortune and has made the sultan, 54, one of the world's wealthiest individuals, with a net worth estimated at $16 billion. His spending is legendary: he has two palaces, one for each wife, the largest a $350 million, 1,788-room building bigger than the Vatican. He paid $53 million in 1985 for London's Dorchester Hotel, then two years later spent an estimated $185 million to buy the Beverly Hills Hotel.
Since the sultan is the absolute ruler, his wealth and the nation's are indistinguishable, even though Brunei is technically a constitutional monarchy. The constitution and legislature have been suspended since an abortive rebellion in 1962. The dearth of elected officials keeps the sultan busy: he is the self-appointed prime minister, finance minister, defense minister, police superintendent and chancellor of the national university.
Autocracy has been good to Bruneians. They pay no income tax. Education and health care are virtually free. And despite its generosity, Brunei's government has no debt.
Brunei is no Kuwait, however. There are no flashy boutiques lining the streets of the capital, Bandar Seri Begawan; Mercedes do not clog the parking lots. On paper, Brunei's average personal income is on a par with Canada's, but it is anyone's guess what the average income is if the royal family is excluded.
The 207,000 barrels of oil Brunei produces every day still account for roughly 40 percent of its economy and almost 90 percent of its exports. Oil is the private sector's biggest customer and the government's chief source of revenue. Yet Brunei Shell Petroleum, the government's joint venture with the Royal Dutch/ Shell Group and the dominant oil producer, hires only about 2,800 Bruneians.
As a result, nearly half the population works for the government, a situation that authorities long ago realized was unsustainable. But it took the country's previous finance minister, the sultan's famously flamboyant playboy brother Prince Jefri, to drive the point home. Prince Jefri was in charge of the super-secret Brunei Investment Agency, or B.I.A., which invests the nation's oil wealth, and of Brunei's largest private company, Amedeo Development. Amedeo poured state money into building projects -- power stations, street lights and the country's cellular phone network -- helping to halve oil's role in the economy.
Amedeo built the playground at Jerudong, including the polo club, a country club, an amusement park and a $1 billion, 600-room hotel with real gold leaf on the walls, a saltwater lagoon and its own golf course designed by Jack Nicklaus.
It all began to unravel in 1997 with a mysterious rift between the brothers. In February, the sultan took over as finance minister. The next month, a former Miss USA and six other American women sued the two in an American court, accusing them of trying to turn them into sex slaves. The sultan denied the charges, and the case was dismissed on the grounds that the men had diplomatic immunity.
The suit was followed by a conservative crackdown in Brunei against un-Islamic practices.
In July 1998, the sultan fired Prince Jefri from the B.I.A. and Amedeo. Auditors went in to find Amedeo teetering under $6 billion in debts and $16 billion in losses. Worse, some Amedeo projects appear to have been financed or backed with B.I.A. funds. Last year, the sultan sued the prince to recover $15 billion he said had been misappropriated. The prince denied the charges.
Before the court could force the prince to shed light on the inner workings of the B.I.A., he and the sultan settled, with the prince agreeing to relinquish his assets in return for a $300,000-a-month allowance.
Outside the Jerudong amusement park, some of the prince's 2,000 cars can still be seen parked behind "For Sale" signs. The Jerudong facilities were put under private management, with the sultan handing over all but 93 of his ponies to an Indonesian company as part of the new equestrian center.
Cleaning up the Amedeo mess was devastating to the economy. Not only did it mean pulling the plug on the nation's biggest private-sector investor, but it forced the sultan to halve government expenditures.
Combined with slower oil exports, Brunei's economy shrank 4 percent in 1998. Rising oil prices have since pulled part of the economy back, but the nonoil economy remains in recession, and incomes and opportunities for new job seekers are falling.
Government officials say they hope the embarrassing financial fiasco will jolt the country from complacency. "It's a blessing in disguise," Mr. Wahab, of the Economic Council Secretariat, said. "These things have opened up our eyes."
The sultan established the council in 1998, and last year it evolved into a 12-member secretariat charged with devising a more balanced economic diet. The secretariat's solution is to cut government spending and subsidies, privatize government-run companies and find new sources of cash -- even by issuing Brunei's first government bonds. At the same time, the secretariat hopes to stimulate the private sector by promoting Brunei as a financial center, tourist destination and high-technology center.
There are formidable obstacles, the first being that half the nation's work force is happy working for the government. Government salaries exceed most private-sector wages, according to Rosni Tungkat, director of the finance ministry's department of economic planning and development. And while government employees get low-interest loans to buy a car and a house, private-sector employees live with the risk of losing their jobs in a country with no unemployment insurance.
Despite having such a vast policy machine, Brunei's progress is hampered by one major bottleneck, critics say. "At the end of the day, the sultan appears to be the one who makes the decision on every economic matter," said one economist, who, like almost everyone working in Brunei, insisted on anonymity. Government planners, he said, "have this way of thinking very big and doing very little."
Few policy planners even know just what resources are available. The B.I.A. discloses nothing; even talking about its investments is forbidden by law. "I myself don't know how much we have or how much we have earned," Ms. Rosni said.
Gradually, progress is being made. The government has frozen hiring and replaced its pension plan with a national fund that applies to nongovernment workers as well, all to encourage more civil servants to take the plunge to the private market.
It recently opened the country's first toll road. There is even talk of charging for health care and education and instituting an income tax.
Also in the works is a local stock market, where the government plans to sell to private investors a bevy of state-owned agencies, from the national telephone operator to the airport. The secretariat is also considering the creation of a national oil company to explore for oil and refine it independently of Shell. Last month, the government inaugurated a program with several banks to provide low-interest loans to local entrepreneurs.
"This is what we've been waiting for," said Abas Mohamed, deputy president of the National Chamber of Commerce and founder of a Web design company. "It will take another couple of years, but the entrepreneurs in Brunei will be stronger."
The Ministry of Industry and Primary Resources, meanwhile, is struggling to lure foreign investment in everything from shrimp and poultry farms to dot-coms and pharmaceutical research, according to Matdanan Jaafar, director of the ministry's planning and industrial promotion department.
Mr. Matdanan acknowledges that interest has been low so far. "Our incentives are not up to date," he said. "And we also have a long approval process." To increase Brunei's allure, he said, the government is considering doubling its corporate-tax exemption for foreign investors to 10 years.
Mr. Matdanan says Brunei has a better chance promoting itself as an exotic destination for tourists visiting the rain forests of Borneo. Travel agents are less sanguine. While Brunei's ban on liquor is no deterrent, Marcel Boeni, a visiting Swiss agent, said its high prices and small size make it a poor alternative to neighboring Malaysia.
And while Jerudong's attractions are high on the list of potential draws, they are not likely to bring crowds, Mr. Boeni said. After all, he asked, "Who rides a plane 17 hours to learn how to ride a horse?"

3 Chip Makers Lower Profit Estimates

BYLINE:  By CHRIS GAITHER 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, March 5 

 BODY:
With demand slowing and inventory growing, three more semiconductor manufacturers warned today that sales and earnings this quarter would disappoint.
 Cypress Semiconductor, Vitesse Semiconductor and LSI Logic lowered their estimates for the current quarter, citing backlogs in the supply chains of companies that buy their computer chips. The announcements surprised few industry observers, who have seen similar warnings from other chip makers in recent weeks and expect more before the quarter's end. 
 Worldwide sales of computer chips fell 5.7 percent between December and January, according to a report released today by the Semiconductor Industry Association. The trade group, based in San Jose, Calif., said sales were $16.87 billion, a 13.7 percent increase over January 2000 but half the 25 percent growth the trade group once projected for the total year. 
"I don't think there's any question the fundamentals for the industry are deteriorating," said Eric Rothdeutsch, a semiconductor analyst and managing director for Robertson Stephens, an investment bank based here. "We've been cautioning customers against almost every semiconductor stock."
Yet investors, perhaps expecting worse news from the companies that lowered their expectations, expressed some relief today. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, a composite of chip maker stocks, rose $30.14, or 5 percent, to $612.34.
Cypress Semiconductor, based in San Jose, said it expected revenues to decline as much as 24 percent from last quarter, when sales were $370 million. The company said it expected a 15 percent decrease because of softening economic conditions and another 9 percent because of changes in its business model. Cypress had said it expected sales to decline between 4 percent and 9 percent.
As a result, the company said it expected earnings of between 30 and 34 cents a share, compared with the 56 cents a share forecasted by Wall Street.
"Business conditions have not improved in the market segment that we serve," T. J. Rodgers, the company's chief executive, said in a statement.
LSI Logic, based in Milpitas, Calif., said it predicted that revenues would drop by 30 percent from last quarter, when it made $751 million.
As a result, the company said its earnings will be 3 cents a share, 18 cents less than it believed at the beginning of the quarter and 8 cents less than the same period a year before.
The company had estimated a 12 percent decline in revenues and earnings of 21 cents a share. 
Vitesse, based in Camarillo, Calif., warned that it expected revenues of $150 million to $160 million, compared with its earlier prediction of $180 million to $190 million. It forecasted earnings of 21 or 22 cents a share, down from the expected 26 or 27 cents a share.
Since the 1950's, the chip industry has dipped, on average, every four years. George Scalise, president of the Semiconductor Industry Association, said the rut chip makers are in now is stronger than earlier ones because manufacturers have lengthened their supply chains by using subcontractors to do more of the work. Longer supply chains make it more difficult for companies to gauge the extent of their inventory backup.
"The difference is probably in part, maybe in large part, because of the semiconductor company's not knowing how much inventory it's sitting on," Mr. Scalise said.
The slowdown has also hurt the industry's leader, the Intel Corporation, which had said it anticipated a 15 percent decline in sales. As part of its regular price adjustments, Intel on Sunday cut wholesale prices of its Celeron microprocessors by as much as 19 percent and for its Pentium III processors by up to 11 percent. Price cuts on the Pentium 4 line, which Intel designed as a replacement for Pentium III, were slimmer, falling between 1 percent and 4 percent.
Intel shares gained $1.06, or 3.6 percent, to $30.38. Cypress rose 27 cents, to $19.13. Vitesse was up $1.25, to $39.06. LSI Logic gained 51 cents, to $16.82.

PERSON: James A. Rhodes 

HEADLINE: Gov. James Rhodes Dies at 91; Sent the Guard to Kent State 

BYLINE:  By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
James A. Rhodes, a four-term Republican governor of Ohio who was known at home as a builder and booster of his state but remembered nationally more for sending onto the Kent State University campus the national guardsmen who killed four students there, died on Sunday at the Ohio State University Medical Center in Columbus, the city where he lived. He was 91.
 Mr. Rhodes was a college dropout who became an author, president of the Amateur Athletic Union and ultimately Ohio's longest-serving governor. 
 Once in the Statehouse, he earned a reputation for a robust expansion of Ohio's economy, infrastructure and university system. Under his leadership, thousands of miles were added to the state's highway network, nearly every county got an airport, and Ohio became a national leader in vocational education.
Though Mr. Rhodes was popular with the state's voters and Republican leaders, his national reputation was tarnished by the shooting at Kent State, on May 4, 1970. 
The episode sprang from the announcement by President Richard M. Nixon that American forces fighting in South Vietnam had moved into Cambodia to deny sanctuary there to North Vietnamese soldiers. With the announcement, antiwar sentiment erupted in demonstrations on campuses across the country.
Governor Rhodes ordered the Guard to Kent State to put down protests that had not only gripped that campus but also spilled over into the town of Kent, where damage had been done to some small businesses. That Monday afternoon, two days after the Guard's arrival and barely 36 hours after arson had damaged an R.O.T.C. building at the university, 13 seconds of rifle fire by a contingent of edgy soldiers who had been ordered to disperse a group of campus protesters killed four students and wounded nine, some of whom had simply been walking to or from class. 
Guard officers at the scene maintained initially that their troops, at whom protesters had thrown stones, had also come under a sniper's fire. But subsequent investigations found no evidence of a sniper.
In 1974, eight soldiers were indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of violating the victims' civil rights; all were acquitted. Mr. Rhodes and 28 other defendants were then sued for damages by the wounded students and parents of the dead. That case was settled in 1979 for $675,000 and a statement of regret.
James Allen Rhodes, a coal miner's son, was born on Sept. 13, 1909, in Coalton, Ohio, not far from Huntington, W.Va. He attended Ohio State University, but did not graduate.
He entered politics as a young man and in 1934 became a Republican committeeman from Columbus, where nine years later he was elected mayor. He won the Republican nomination for governor in 1954, lost the election to the Democratic incumbent, Frank J. Lausche, then finally captured the Statehouse in 1962 and served through 1970.
Barred by law from seeking a third straight term, he ran for the Senate but lost the nomination to Robert A. Taft Jr. He reclaimed the governorship four years later, served eight more years, through 1982, stepped down again and was defeated when in 1986 he tried for a fifth term, against a Democratic incumbent, Gov. Richard F. Celeste.
During the late 1940's, Mr. Rhodes also served as president of the Amateur Athletic Union, then the governing body of several amateur sports in the United States. In addition, he wrote several books, including one on vocational education and three books of history: "Johnny Shiloh" (1958), "The Trial of Mary Todd Lincoln" (1959) and "The Court-Martial of Commodore Perry" (1960).
He is survived by two daughters, Suzanne Moore of Upper Arlington, Ohio, and Sharon Markham of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and nine grandchildren. His wife, Helen Rawlins Rhodes, to whom he was married for 46 years, died in 1987.

HEADLINE: The Victims in Indonesia's Pursuit of Progress 

BYLINE:  By Abigail Abrash; Abigail Abrash is an adviser to the Indonesia Human Rights Network and has monitored conditions in Indonesia since 1993.

DATELINE: KEENE, N.H. 

 BODY:
The recent bloody fighting in Borneo makes compelling copy. The violence seems savage, the context exotic. Yet the killings, with at least 400 dead in the past two weeks, are not as remote as they might seem. The Madurese migrants being attacked by the indigenous Dayak people of Central Kalimantan Province are scapegoats for the failed economic and social policies that Indonesia, with American support, has followed for far too long.
 For decades, the Dayaks -- like Papuans, Acehnese, Moluccans and other indigenous communities throughout the Indonesian archipelago -- have been on the receiving end of destructive policies imposed by the central government in Jakarta and backed by repressive political and military force. 
 Under Indonesia's laws, inherited from the Dutch colonial regime, the state and corporations with state backing have seized the lands of these communities for mining and logging, single-crop plantations, factory fishing and building of roads and other infrastructure. Until they were suspended last summer, government "transmigration" policies -- relocating Indonesians, like the former Madura islanders attacked in Borneo, from populous areas to less "developed" lands -- provided a labor force for such projects. These business operations have also created boomtowns attracting thousands of other "spontaneous" migrants who further rend a social fabric woven together over hundreds, sometimes thousands, of years in the fragile ecosystems of Indonesia's more than 10,000 islands.
Indonesia's legal system offers no adequate respect for community land rights and no effective protection for traditional livelihoods. Indeed, land disputes account for the greatest number of complaints brought to Indonesia's National Commission on Human Rights.
The American State Department's annual report on human rights, released last month, charged that the Indonesian government had "used its authority, and at times intimidation, to appropriate land for development projects, particularly in areas claimed by indigenous people, and often without fair compensation." It further stated, "When indigenous people clash with private-sector development projects, the developers almost always prevail."
Indonesia's military plays a critical role in the economy, relying on its private business interests for an estimated two-thirds of its annual budget. The military has not hesitated to acquire and protect its own and others' assets by force. A lieutenant commander of Indonesia's elite American-trained special forces described for a human-rights investigator in 1998 what role the military played in establishing and protecting natural-resource operations and other development projects: "The military is here to make sure that investors can come in."
The current economic structure was introduced under the rule of the former president and army general Suharto, whose government ruled from 1966 to 1998, and has been supported by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, among others. Economic development under Mr. Suharto's New Order regime was based on exploitation of nonrenewable resources and low-wage labor. Over the decades, this system has siphoned the necessarily short-term profits of resource extraction upward to foreign stockholders and Indonesia's national elite, particularly members and friends of the Suharto family.
In the 1990's, the impact of these economic strategies on local peoples like the Dayaks, and on Indonesia's environment, has actually worsened, thanks in large part to I.M.F. structural-adjustment policies and to increased investment from abroad in destructive projects. The palm-oil, timber, and mining businesses, all benefiting from American investment, have been particularly harmful to the Indonesian environment -- and, often, to the indigenous people whose lands they use.
Other businesses have more subtle effects on Indonesian solvency, as well as on public confidence in American good will. For example, a number of American power companies, including General Electric, agreed in the mid-90's to invest in power generation as partners with the state utility. In many cases, the foreign companies were to be paid in dollars, while the utility collected its bills in Indonesian currency.
When Asian markets crashed in 1997, Indonesia's currency lost much of its value, and the state utility, not surprisingly, was bankrupted. American and other foreign investors, or their insurers, demanded payment. American ambassador Robert Gelbard, the federal Overseas Private Investment Corporation and others placed enormous pressure on Indonesia to pay up at precisely the time when its economy had been devastated and the country was just emerging from 30 years of military rule. In context, such a policy of putting American corporate interests first is inherently destabilizing, and it certainly did Indonesian reformers, including the current president, Abdurrahman Wahid, no favors at all.
The current condition of Indonesia, the fourth most populous nation in the world, is perilous. Morgan Stanley economists currently estimate Indonesia's total public debt to be $152 billion, or 99 percent of its gross domestic product. With some 40 percent of government operating expenditures going to make payments on this debt, experts acknowledge that Indonesia is facing a permanent debt trap.
The Bush administration should advocate canceling some or all of Indonesia's public debt. This action has been widely debated in Indonesia, but the nation does not yet qualify under I.M.F. and World Bank rules for significant debt relief.
The Bush administration should also strongly support Indonesian investigators in their efforts to go after Suharto family assets illicitly gained, and to continue the suspension of United States assistance and training to Indonesia's military.
Finally, the United States should look much more critically at its own lending practices and at American corporate activity in Indonesia. Both have often tended, for three decades now, to enrich the military and civilian elites, as well as American investors, at the expense of most Indonesians.

HEADLINE: Mired in Recession, Argentina Is Reshuffling Cabinet 

BYLINE:  By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, March 5 

 BODY:
For the second time in five months, President Fernando de la Rua has begun shaking up his cabinet, another effort to jump-start a faltering economy and to instill confidence among an increasingly restive public.
 Mr. De la Rua called on his entire cabinet to resign on Saturday night after the resignation of the economy minister, Jose Luis Machinea. Mr. Machinea will be succeeded by the defense minister, Ricardo Lopez Murphy, a conservative economist and graduate of the University of Chicago, who has called for a sharp cut in the number of government employees. 
 "We want to assure all Argentines that this will be for the good of the country," Mr. De la Rua said.
Officials said that it was not clear how far the housecleaning would go and that it could take a week for the president to put his government back in order. There were no indications that there would be a major shift in policies by the often fractious coalition government of centrists and Social Democrats.
The root of the current crisis is a recession that has lasted more than two years, producing an unemployment rate of over 15 percent and sharp spending cuts among the middle class. Mr. De la Rua took office 15 months ago promising to re-ignite the economy by bringing down interest rates, by increasing investment through tax increases and cutbacks in government programs and by restructuring the labor code.
But the economy slid again slightly last year, after a 3.2 percent decrease in gross domestic product in 1999. Economists predicted that the economy would remain flat in the first quarter and that growth through the rest of the year would be anemic. The Argentine stock market, which had soared in January on renewed hopes of growth, plummeted in February; the Merval index soared 8.1 percent today on the news of Mr. Lopez Murphy's appointment.
Confidence has further receded in recent weeks because of an investigation by a United States Senate subcommittee into money laundering that indicated that several Argentine banks were laundering drug and bribery money.
Revelations from Washington have increased pressure for the resignation of the central bank president, Pedro Pou, who is in charge of monitoring the banking system. Mr. Pou has refused to resign, and until recently, he has received support from Mr. De la Rua.
But officials said this weekend that Mr. De la Rua was seeking to replace Mr. Pou with Domingo Cavallo, a former economy minister who installed the convertibility system that tied the Argentine peso to the American dollar in the early 1990's. A joint congressional committee would have to recommend that Mr. Pou be dismissed before Mr. De la Rua could act.
Mr. Cavallo and Mr. Lopez Murphy are well respected on Wall Street and would be expected to relieve fears among investors that Argentina would try to devalue the peso to break out of its recession.
Mr. Lopez Murphy was a consultant at the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, and is considered the most orthodox of the economists close to Mr. De la Rua.
Speaking at a news conference, Mr. Lopez Murphy indicated that Argentina would comply with targets set with the International Monetary Fund as part of a $39.7 billion international rescue package delivered in December. 
"We have a program and a financial plan negotiated with multinational lenders," he said. "I plan on following through with that agreement." 
Horacio Jaunarena, the secretary of the presidency who was a defense minister in the 1980's, was to succeed Mr. Lopez Murphy as the country's top military official.
Mr. Lopez Murphy was to become Mr. De la Rua's first economy minister until he publicly said, during the 1999 presidential campaign, that hefavored cutting government employees' salaries. To recover from the political damage, Mr. De la Rua was forced to promise that Mr. Lopez Murphy would not take charge of the economy and instead put Mr. Machinea in the post.
Mr. Machinea was never able to assume a commanding position before either international investors or the Argentine public. He repeatedly promised a recovery from the recession and eventually lost his credibility.
"One phase is over," Mr. Machinea said after resigning. "This week there were many internal disputes, but I am not leaving angry."
The current shake-up comes only five months after Vice President Carlos Alvarez resigned in protest over Mr. De la Rua's handling of a scandal involving bribes to several opposition senators in order to enact a labor code. 
Several cabinet ministers were forced to resign, and the scandal still casts a shadow over the government as a judge investigates the bribery accusations. 
Opposition leaders have criticized the government for appearing rudderless.
"The image we have around the world," former President Carlos Saul Menem said, "is that there is no one leading Argentina."

F.A.A. May Bypass Bids For Air Traffic Contract
The Federal Aviation Administration is preparing to skip competitive bidding and choose Lockheed Martin to design and build a replacement for the heart of its antiquated long-distance air traffic control system.
 One reason, officials say, is that the company has become familiar with the system over the last few years in performing other work, including replacing old computers in the centers just before the end of 1999. Page A1. 

I.R.S. Steps Up Tax-Evasion Raids
The Internal Revenue Service said that it conducted its most extensive raids ever last week, pursuing suspected promoters of tax evasion schemes for affluent people. Among the targets were the Institute of Global Prosperity, which promotes what the government says are fraudulent tax and investment schemes, and Jerome Schneider, author of books on moving money offshore to cut or eliminate taxes. A1.

O'Neill to Keep Stock and Options
Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill, left, has decided to hold onto about $100 million in Alcoa stock and options, giving him perhaps the largest single-company holding that a top government official has ever held. The decision contrasts with moves made by other government officials. Vice President Dick Cheney announced he would donate to charity his remaining options to buy stock in Halliburton, the oil company. A16.

3 Chip Makers Warn on Profits
With demand slowing and inventory growing, three semiconductor makers -- Cypress Semiconductor, Vitesse Semiconductor and LSI Logic -- warned that sales and earnings this quarter would fall short of estimates. C6.

Pearson, the British media and educational publishing company, said that it had stepped up such spending fivefold last year, lopping 17 percent off its pretax profit for 2000 in the process. World Business, Section W.

Kroger to Restate Its Results
Kroger said that it would restate past earnings by "minor amounts" because of accounting practices at its Ralphs Grocery unit that were concealed from Kroger auditors. Kroger, based in Cincinnati, also said that its fiscal fourth-quarter profit would match expectations on a rise of 13 percent in total sales. Shares of Kroger fell 62 cents, to $23.70. C4.

HEADLINE: PRO FOOTBALL; 
Giants Agree on a Contract With Barber

BYLINE:  By BILL PENNINGTON 

 BODY:
Stormy weather, or the threat of it, can even disrupt the off-season march of a National Football League team trying to get back to the Super Bowl.
 The Giants have agreed to a new contract with the free-agent running back Tiki Barber and would like him to sign it. They would also like to begin interviewing some free-agent pass-rushing specialists. But snow in the weather forecast yesterday kept the team from moving forward on either front. 
 Barber's new six-year, $25.2 million contract should be ready for his signature as early as today, and it could be completed if Barber can get from his Manhattan home to Giants Stadium. Barber will also receive a $7 million signing bonus, though some of that money is to be deferred to provide the Giants with salary-cap relief.
The Giants may need the cap room if they are to sign another defensive end. They had planned to entertain Ndukwe Kalu, a free agent who has played the last four seasons in Washington, today, and Simeon Rice, the third pick over all during the 1996 college draft, yesterday. But the Giants postponed those visits until later this week.
Meanwhile, days after punter Brad Maynard left the team when he signed a five-year, $5.25 million contract with the Chicago Bears, the Giants' special-teams coach, Larry Mac Duff, informed the team yesterday that he planned to become the new defensive coordinator at the University of Arizona. Mac Duff held that job at Arizona from 1987 to 1996.
Had Mac Duff announced his departure last week, it is possible Maynard might not have left the Giants. It is true that Maynard, who was raised in central Indiana, was eager to get back to his Midwestern roots. But he also frequently chafed under Mac Duff's tutelage because he thought Mac Duff -- with the full consent of Giants Coach Jim Fassel -- too frequently asked him to employ a directional punting style. Based on blocking schemes, Maynard was also ordered to approach many kicks by striding toward his left or right as he prepared to punt the football.
It became clear that Maynard, who still has the third-highest gross punting average in the history of college football, was getting more and more distracted during his tenure with the Giants. In 1998, his second season in the N.F.L., Maynard was among the top five punters in the league in gross and net average. His decline began the next year and continued last season when he had his worst year as a professional -- a gross average of 40.6 yards per kick and a net average of 33.7 yards.
There is another reason -- besides the Chicago contract offer that more than tripled his Giants salary -- that Maynard may have chosen to leave the team. A close friend, place-kicker Brad Daluiso, is not likely to return to the Giants, either. Daluiso is expected to be replaced by Jaret Holmes, whom the Giants kept on their active roster most of last year as insurance because Daluiso was coming back from knee surgery.
Holmes, 25, is eight years younger than Daluiso, and Holmes will come back at a far smaller price. He also displayed a strong, accurate leg in four months of practice last season.
So the Giants' special teams will have an entirely new look next season. With Mac Duff, who was a frequent target of criticism, gone, Giants fans will get to see if the special teams' inconsistencies have stemmed from a lack of talent or the coach's input. But the new special-teams coach will undoubtedly be working with players with less experience.
Holmes has two career field-goal attempts. The only punter now on the Giants' roster is Rodney Williams, a prospect from Georgia Tech with no N.F.L. experience. The Giants will bring another punter to training camp, and could even use a late-round draft pick on a punter as well.
As for the Giants' pursuit of a pass-rushing defensive end, it proves that they are dissatisfied with the production of right defensive end Cedric Jones, who had just three and a half sacks last season. Kalu would be the economical choice and could perhaps be used in tandem with Jones, the Giants' first-round 1996 pick. But Kalu is also being pursued by the Eagles and the Falcons. The Redskins have also said they would still like to retain Kalu, who did not see much action last year as Bruce Smith's backup.
Rice would be the splashy choice, but he is being wooed by other teams, too, including Tampa Bay. If Rice wants a contract similar to the $8 million annually that the Giants' left defensive end, Michael Strahan, receives, the Giants will not be in the bidding.
The Giants do have room for a reasonably big contract, however, and the key to the Rice sweepstakes could be the Giants' defensive line coach, Denny Marcin, who coached Rice at the University of Illinois. Marcin's personnel opinions are highly respected -- he recommended the offensive coordinator Sean Payton to the Giants even when Payton was an obscure Philadelphia quarterbacks coach -- and Marcin knows Rice well.
Rice had a tempestuous time in Arizona, but he also had 16.5 sacks during his 1999 Pro Bowl season. The question might be whether Marcin can convince his bosses in the front office that Rice is the right fit for the Giants and convince Rice that Giants Stadium is the right locale for him.
The weather notwithstanding.

HEADLINE: THEATER REVIEW; 
Just Too Saintly for His Own Good

BYLINE:  By BRUCE WEBER 

 BODY:
The Manhattan Ensemble Theater is a brand-new SoHo-based company with the stated mission of dramatizing classic novels. For its inaugural offering, its founder and artistic director, David Fishelson, has chosen "The Idiot," based on his own adaptation of Dostoyevsky's 1868 novel about the saintly epileptic Prince Myshkin and his ultimately tragic engagement with a society that has lost its moral compass. A revival of sorts -- Mr. Fishelson first staged it in 1992 at the Jean Cocteau Repertory Theater, and he has engaged the same actor, John Lenartz, in the title role here -- the production makes the company's serious ambitions clear, and it doesn't shy from the complexities of rendering a long and intricate narrative in stage time and space. With 15 actors in 25 roles, and 15 scenes spread over three acts (and two intermissions) it clocks in at over three hours. 
 But it is, on its own merits, a shaky debut, hampered particularly by cast members who often seem uneasy in period roles and who cope narrowly with Dostoyevsky's probing scrutiny of their characters' motivations, leaping all too eagerly into scenery-chewing high dudgeon or comic caricature. 
 This doesn't apply to Mr. Lenartz, whose naturally pained expression is appropriate for Myshkin's honesty, humility and perplexity at the selfishness of those around him. If anything, one ends up wishing for a bit more from him; it's a huge role, and his placidity could do with a few more notes. Nor does it apply to Triney Sandoval, who plays Rogozhin, his desperate and newly rich rival for the beautiful harlot, Nastasya Filipovna (Roxanna Hope), with a nicely inflected hint of madness.
Otherwise there is a sense of inexperience that emanates from the stage, as the actors seem to be playing their muddled feelings one at a time, scene by scene, without an overall understanding of who they are. This is particularly evident in the interminable second act, when Nastasya and the spoiled beauty Aglaya (Abigail Lopez) joust with each other and with their own moral conflicts over the love of Myshkin and other suitors. 
Their rapid changes of mind are meant to deepen the play's sense that society in St. Petersburg is in the grip of a spiritual vexation brought on by political, economic and cultural shifts in a Russia that has begun looking to the West, toward capitalism and religious multiplicity. But here the women merely seem inconsequentially fickle. This is not to single out the two actresses, because the entire ensemble and the midplay pacelessness of Mr. Fishelson's direction are all to blame for the plot confusion and tedium that turns Dostoyevsky's cri de coeur over the corruption of his homeland into strained melodrama. 
In the third act, with the near-wedding of Myshkin and Nastasya and her bolting at the altar for Rogozhin, Mr. Fishelson recoups some of the production's integrity with the evening's most energetic staging. And the confrontation between Myshkin and Rogozhin in the aftermath of Nastasya's murder is charged with genuinely complex emotion. The finale doesn't quite remedy our exhaustion, but it sends the audience away holding to a good wish for the new company, that there is a worthy foundation to build on.

PERSON: Christopher Kui 

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES; 
Fighting a Happy Image of Self-Sufficiency

BYLINE:  By CHRIS HEDGES 

 BODY:
A FEW weeks after Christopher Kui arrived as a 10-year-old immigrant from Hong Kong, he walked into a public library in East New York. A sign hung on a wall promising a ticket to a Yankees game to any child who memorized the names of the 50 states. And so he set to work, struggling not only to learn the states but also to pronounce their names correctly in an unfamiliar tongue.
 The rest one might guess at. Mr. Kui, who won a ticket, went on to excel in school, graduate with an economics degree from New York University and succeed in business. But the story, of the diligent Chinese immigrant who makes good, is one he, in a certain strategic sense, hates. For Mr. Kui has spent most of his adult life trying to organize a swelling Asian community he considers complacent and misunderstood to assert itself. 
 "When we get involved in the political process, we will no longer be invisible," he said. "I want to erase this stereotype of the model Chinese-American immigrant who does not need help."
As a student tutor during his years at Brooklyn Technical High School and N.Y.U., he was haunted by the stories of deprivation and sweatshops, of unscrupulous landlords and indifferent city bureaucrats that he heard from Chinese immigrant laborers. He continued to tutor immigrants as the manager of a print and design shop but finally quit to join Asian Americans for Equality in 1986, a group set up 27 years ago to combat discrimination against newly arrived immigrants.
"My parents did not understand what this job was about," he said. "They were concerned that it did not have a future, that I could not build a career. But they have come to see that what I do is to help people like themselves and their friends. I saw what my parents' generation did for their children, how they sacrificed their lives so their children could go to college and have professions. I want to give something back."
As executive director of Asian Americans for Equality, Mr. Kui, 41, runs the city's most prominent Asian civil rights group. He is planning street protests over the temporary closing of the Grant Street subway station in Chinatown. The station will be shut down for four years while the Manhattan Bridge is rehabilitated. Mr. Kui led a fight two years ago to get the city to add a second exit to the station.
THE closing, he said, is a potent illustration of how the city's Asians, who number some 600,000, are ignored. Although the closing will, he said, "severely impact the daily lives of hundreds of thousands of people" who depend on access to Chinatown from growing immigrant communities along the B and D lines in Brooklyn, the city "never felt the need to hold a public hearing."
"If there is no public hearing, the city will not be responsible for the impact on the community," he said. "This refusal to consult the community would have never happened if this stop was on the Upper East Side. A large market for the local merchants will be effectively cut off due to the tremendous inconvenience of having to use the Canal Street Station for transportation. Keeping in mind that the shopping community is in large part seniors and people on the way home from work, the added 20- to 30-minute walk with groceries and goods in tow becomes an incredible burden."
If Mr. Kui walked into a room filled with social activists, he would probably be pegged as the undercover federal agent. He speaks in the no-nonsense tone of an entrepreneur. When asked about his wife and personal life, he dismissed the questions as "something I don't want to get into." Asked about China, Mr. Kui, who lives in Woodside, tersely said: "I am an American citizen now. I was in Hong Kong for the transfer. The visit wrapped up the last vestiges of my attachment to Hong Kong."
He wears dark suits and pressed white shirts. The bookshelves in his office are lined with titles like "Jack Welch and the G.E. Way," "How to Think Like a C.E.O." and "Highly Effective People." He had difficulty coming up with hobbies outside work. 
But while his personal mannerisms are understated, his politics are not. And he and his organization have done much to transform Chinatown. His group has arranged financing to renovate or finance the building of 500 units for low- and moderate-income families, with more on the way. "There," he said, pointing to an empty lot near his Norfolk Street office, "is where we will begin our next $8 million building project." 
Along with housing, he overseas a huge citizenship drive. His agency runs language and civics courses. Its staff helps fill out immigration forms and guides families through the process. 
Ann Moy, a volunteer who poses as an Immigration and Naturalization Service officer in mock interviews, stood in St. George's, an Episcopal church in Flushing, after a ceremony for 60 new citizens. She ran down the list of questions she threw out in her role. "Of course," she said, "they have to know the 50 states."

HEADLINE: When Slaves And Currency Were One; 
Interpreting the Images of Toil That The Confederacy Used on Its Money

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: CHARLESTON, S.C. 

 BODY:
Without a magnifying glass, it is difficult to see the faces on the slaves as they harvest cotton and hoist overflowing baskets to their shoulders. Minutely engraved on the tattered currency of the old South, the images are faded and smudged, and their message has languished in the vaults of collectors.
 About four years ago, a collector took one of the old Confederate bank notes into a North Charleston blueprint shop and asked an employee, John W. Jones, to have it enlarged. Mr. Jones, an artist and commercial illustrator who frequently paints African-American themes, studied the engraving on the note and was struck by the Confederacy's decision to use as its monetary symbol an accomplished image of a black field hand straining at the cotton harvest. 
 Prowling through hobby shops and Internet sites, he realized that scenes of slave labor were in fact a prevailing image on Southern currency during the mid-19th century. Where other states and nations used historical scenes or pictures of national leaders and resources on their money, the Confederate states often chose to portray themselves as the land of slaves, usually contented and sometimes smiling.
But these historical documents had to be enlarged to be appreciated. Because very few visual depictions of slavery were made at the time, Mr. Jones got out his acrylics and canvas and began painting these vignettes as full-size works, adding nothing but color. An exhibition of about 30 of his paintings opened in February at the College of Charleston in its Avery Research Center for African-American History and Culture, and it has been drawing a steady audience of both blacks and whites.
"We built the economy of the South, and here you have the banks saying so," said Mr. Jones, who now works in a studio in Columbia. "But no one had seen these images. No one realized what was on the bills."
Numismatists have long known about the bills' imagery, but historians have recently begun taking a closer look at it as a statement of the South's economic priorities during the war. An Internet exhibition created last year by the United States Civil War Center at Louisiana State University has more than 75 engravings of slavery from Confederate paper money. (The exhibition can be seen at www.cwc.lsu.edu /BeyondFaceValue.)
At the time, money was printed both by the Confederate States of America and by the banks of the individual Southern states. Several scholars who contributed to the online project noted that Southern banks enshrined slavery in their monetary system to remind those who came in contact with their bills that the institution was the region's economic bedrock.
"Slaves were the capital of the South," said Henry N. McCarl, an economics professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and a numismatist who contributed an essay and part of his collection to the online exhibition. "Cultures put on their money objects that are important to them and their economy, and the South had an interest in showing to the world that the slaves were well treated and happy."
There are, of course, no scenes of slaves being mistreated on the bills, and in a few close-ups they are smiling as they move in ragged clothes and bare feet through the cotton fields. In one scene painted by Mr. Jones from a South Carolina $5 bill, a white overseer supervises a group of slaves from his horse with his whip in his hand; in another, a white man and woman gaze down at a quartet of bent-over slaves working with scythes in a wheat field.
The pictures, like the Confederacy itself, are almost entirely agrarian and usually romanticized, etched by engravers who are not now identifiable. Slaves are shown loading sugar cane onto wagons and leading cattle and very frequently working with cotton: planting it, picking it, hauling it, baling it. The cotton images are repeated so often they become iconographic, and some of the bills show classical goddesses of liberty or prosperity -- even George Washington -- gazing at the cotton scenes with admiration and blessing. In one allegorical picture painted by Mr. Jones from a Georgia Savings Bank bill, a white figure that is apparently that of Moneta, the Roman goddess of money, is in the foreground holding a cotton plant as bags of gold spill open at her feet. In the background, an overseer on a horse supervises a field of slaves as a train arrives to pick up their harvest.
"I was particularly intrigued by that one," said Mr. Jones, most of whose paintings in the series have been snapped up by collectors. "The slaves are doing the work, and she's got the money."
John M. Coski, historian and library director at the Museum of the Confederacy in Richmond, Va., said that there were more vignettes from classical mythology than of slaves on Southern currency, and that the banks were not so much making a grand statement about slavery as they were simply depicting their world. But several African-American scholars disagree about the statement being made by the money.
"We did this exhibit because of what John showed us about the South," said W. Marvin Dulaney, director of the Avery Research Center and a history professor at the College of Charleston. "We hear a lot these days about how the Confederacy was really about states' rights and not slavery. But the currency itself tells the truth. It shows how they saw us, and how they wanted to keep seeing us."

HEADLINE: Singing a Song for Tibet; 
Struggling to Preserve a Culture, at Home and Abroad

BYLINE:  By SUSAN SACHS 

 BODY:
Class begins with a Buddhist prayer for the world and ends with a song for Tibet. In between, Pema Dorjee, a diminutive monk in a sleeveless orange robe, darts among his students as they struggle with the characters of the Tibetan alphabet.
 None of the 15 or so Tibetan children who come to his Sunday language course in Manhattan have ever seen Tibet, the isolated mountain nation that China invaded in 1950 and forcibly absorbed. Nor have many of their parents, exiles who were born and raised in refugee settlements in India or Nepal. 
 But Tibet is what -- at least so far -- holds them together as a group. 
"The children are our hope to preserve our culture," said Mr. Dorjee, a store clerk on weekdays. "They can keep Tibet alive."
It is an uphill struggle.
As for other immigrants at other times, young Tibetans face multiple distractions and temptations in their new American lives. Maintaining the culture of home -- and in the case of these Tibetan-Americans, a home twice removed -- competes with the natural inclination to concentrate on managing a new culture.
But for Tibetans, the traditional tug of war is complicated by a real ambivalence on the part of their leadership toward their growing presence in the United States. In their political lobbying and fund-raising in the West, Tibetan exiles have argued for decades that Tibetan culture will die if Tibetans scatter across the globe. 
"We have mixed feelings within ourselves," said Rinchen Dharlo, president of the Tibet Fund, an organization in New York that sponsors the language classes and raises money for the Indian and Nepalese resettlement camps. 
"I don't really worry here in the States, at least for this generation," he said. "It will all depend on whether our community stays together, as it does today, in clusters. If so, we will be able to keep our culture." 
In just a decade, the number of Tibetan exiles in this country has increased more than tenfold. It is still a tiny group -- barely 9,000 people in all, scattered over 30 cities -- with the largest concentration of about 2,000 people in New York City. Another 2,000 Tibetan exiles are believed to live in Canada, Mr. Dharlo said.
Nearly invisible in the city's expanding and ever more diverse immigrant population, many of the Tibetans who are now living here came on visitors' visas and stayed. And like the city's other illegal immigrants, they have had to find jobs on the bottom tiers of the economy. Many Tibetan women work as nannies. Many men find jobs as store clerks or on construction sites.
Until the early 1990's, however, Tibetan exiles numbered in the few hundreds in North America, where they actively promoted their cause of freeing Tibet from Chinese rule. Then Congress presented the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibetans, with the opportunity to legally resettle 1,000 people in the United States.
The offer caused consternation. 
"Many of our American friends said, 'It's not good to bring too many Tibetans to the States, because this country is a melting pot,' " Mr. Dharlo said. 
But the Tibetan leadership eventually decided that the mythical melting pot was not what it might seem and that many immigrants, if they stay close together, succeed in preserving their language and, to some degree, their culture. 
In any case, they concluded, the political advantages outweighed the risks of assimilation.
"We thought that if we bring 1,000 Tibetans, they will be ambassadors in this country to make additional friends for Tibet," Mr. Dharlo said. "And if we are able to save the culture of six million Tibetans in Tibet, strengthen the Tibetan struggle and bring it closer to fruition, then it doesn't matter if these 1,000 Tibetans lose their identity in this country."
To some degree, young Tibetans are playing that ambassadorial role.
"Nobody really knew anything about Tibet in my school, but I try to tell them," said Tashi Dorje, who is 15 and learning Tibetan dance at the Sunday school. "They ask me why Tibetans got kicked out of our own country. I tell them we are peaceful and we don't fight." 
Still, in their own homes, many Tibetan parents are wrestling with those very dilemmas that had worried their leaders. They see their Buddhist faith and their Tibetan language buffeted daily by the simple fact of living among non-Tibetans.
"Selfishness is very strong in this country," said Chunta Lama, who came to New York with her husband and young son from India three years ago. "And it's very materialistic. The moment you see all these material things, you may lose respect for your own culture."
Some children, as they become more like their American friends each day, even question elements of their religion, deeply shocking parents who could not have imagined debating such things with their elders. 
"They think this is blind faith," said Mrs. Lama, who brings her son to Sunday school every week and makes sure he practices writing Tibetan along with his regular homework. "They want to know why, in this age of computers and science, we believe what we believe." 
But learning about Tibetan culture is not only a struggle for the young.
Tenzin Wangyhl, one of the first refugees to come as part of the Congressional allotment, teaches traditional dances and songs on Sundays at the Tibet Fund's headquarters. What he knows, he learned from listening to old tapes after he arrived in New York in 1993 and from recent visits to Tibetan refugee camps in India.
"Recently, we've had some kids who have just arrived from India," Mr. Wangyhl said one recent Sunday, as he watched three teenage boys practice the Tibetan drum dance outside in the bitter cold. "They've kept up with it better than I was able to at that age."
As often happens with pioneering immigrants, those first refugees like Mr. Wangyhl sent for their families, as they were allowed to do under the law. But their presence inspired friends, distant relatives and others to come and join them.
Many of those who arrived in the last few years came without valid documents, believing that the United States would grant them political asylum. That assumption, for most, has proved to be wrong. 
The Immigration and Naturalization Service considers Tibetans stateless, but it has opposed most asylum requests from those who lived for most of their lives in Nepal or India. The agency's position, supported by immigration judges, is that an applicant must prove that he or she suffered or fears persecution in the country of last residence.
Judges generally decide that India and Nepal treat Tibetan exiles well, lawyers who represent Tibetans say, even if those countries restrict or refuse to give citizenship to the refugees. Few asylum applications have been granted.
Canada, on the other hand, grants most asylum requests from Tibetans. And over the last three years, according to refugee agencies and Canadian lawyers, nearly 1,000 exiles who had been living in the New York area crossed the border and claimed asylum in Canada. 
Judges there generally rely on a different test for deciding whether a Tibetan exile faces persecution in the country of resettlement. They have repeatedly ruled that a Tibetan who does not have citizenship in India or Nepal runs the risk of one day being deported to China, which now controls Tibet. 
"If you have no status in a country, you don't have a right to remain," said Constance Nakatsu, a Toronto lawyer who has represented many Tibetans seeking asylum in Canada. "And the Tibetans really don't have a home."

HEADLINE: School District Cuts Teachers In Flush Times 

BYLINE:  By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS 

 BODY:
Despite flush economic times in New York City, a school district on the West Side has ordered the layoffs of dozens of part-time teachers, citing severe budget shortfalls, school officials said.
 The layoffs in elementary and middle schools in Community School District 3 seem unusual at a time when the city has a shortage of thousands of qualified teachers and Board of Education officials are struggling to recruit and train top-quality candidates. 
 Several principals said yesterday in interviews that the cuts had surprised them. Parents described children returning from school last week in tears because popular teachers were being let go. 
One principal said that if the superintendent of District 3, Patricia Romandetto, was facing a budget shortfall, she was choosing to combat it in the most harmful possible way to children -- through direct cuts to instruction.
"It would be one thing if the district were in a major financial crisis and they'd come to us consistently for help," said one of several principals who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "But this makes me feel extremely disrespected, maltreated and vulnerable."
It was not clear yesterday whether any of the laid-off teachers would be transferred to other schools in the city.
Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers, said the last time the city started to lay off elementary or middle school teachers in midyear was during the 1991 recession. In that case, the city called for the layoff of 4,000 teachers and paraprofessionals, but the cutbacks were averted through retirement incentives. 
Ms. Weingarten said Ms. Romandetto had originally ordered that 10 to 40 full-time teachers be laid off. After the union protested, that order was rescinded Friday and principals were told to achieve the same savings by laying off part-time teachers, who teach subjects like reading, library and dance. Ms. Weingarten said the total number of part-time teachers affected was 55. 
Several principals gave a slightly different version of events. They said Ms. Romandetto's order on Wednesday, before the union intervened, was to lay off an average of three to five full-time teachers in each of the district's 35 schools. The principals said the cuts in jobs or hours have affected only part-time instructors, but parents said some full-time teachers still appeared to be threatened.
Principals said they had been told that in addition to the layoffs, all programs conducted after 3 p.m. would be cut starting in April, including Project Read, a program begun by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to give intensive help to children who have fallen behind in reading. Schools would not be allowed to hire substitutes through the end of the school year, principals said they were told. 
Chancellor Harold O. Levy said the layoffs had not been brought to his attention until a reporter called him yesterday. He said Ms. Romandetto told him when he called her yesterday that District 3 was forced to cut spending because the student enrollment turned out to be below what was projected at the start of the school year. 
"This is unfortunate, particularly at a time that we want to emphasize arts and music," Mr. Levy said. "But it is probably unavoidable given budget constraints."
Mr. Levy said that 40 part-time teachers were being laid off, and that most of them worked two to three days a week, a somewhat lower estimate than that given by union officials and principals.
According to the board's preliminary Feb. 16 budget memorandum, enrollment citywide is lower than projected, and several districts have to give back money. However, the amount District 3 had to give back is relatively low, $67,574. The district had 133 students below projections, or 13,417 instead of 13,550, but under a special formula was charged for the loss of only 32 students, according to preliminary figures. 
Other districts have much greater losses; for instance, District 2, also in Manhattan, has to give back $500,000, and District 16 has to give back $1.5 million. No other district is known to be laying off teachers, however. 
Asked about the figures, Mr. Levy said those documents were preliminary and therefore unreliable, but he declined to provide any other detailed figures. Ms. Romandetto could not be reached for comment yesterday because district offices were closed because of the storm, and the Board of Education declined to make her available.
Mary Zaflofsky, the mother of a student at Public School 166, in District 3, said a full-time third-grade teacher at the school wasn laid off on Friday. The teacher, Ms. Zaflofsky said, was the third one this year to head an academically troubled class of students who are facing the first round of citywide reading and math tests in a few weeks.
The teacher, Ms. Zaflofsky said, will be replaced by one nearing retirement who is being reassigned from elsewhere in the school.
At P.S. 9, parents have been warned that a fourth-grade teacher going on maternity leave in April might also be replaced by transferring an assistant teacher from within the school, rather than by hiring an experienced permanent teacher, according to Jenny Nelson, the Parent-Teacher Association president.
"I've been on the P.T.A. executive board for seven years, and I've never seen this happen," Ms. Nelson said.
Several principals said they feared retribution if they spoke for attribution because Ms. Romandetto had said at a districtwide meeting of principals on Wednesday that word of the cuts should not leave the room.
"Here the chancellor is trying to recruit people from prestigious colleges to teach in our schools," one principal said. "We're essentially at the zenith of this economy. With this happening, why would an educated person take a chance on New York City schools next year?" 

CORRECTION-DATE: March 8, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about layoffs of teachers in Manhattan School District 3 misidentified the school where a parent said a full-time third-grade teacher had been dropped. It was Public School 163, not 166.

HEADLINE: Collegial Atmosphere Pervades C. W. Post Professors' Strike 

BYLINE:  By AL BAKER 

DATELINE: BROOKVILLE, N.Y., March 2 

 BODY:
On the rolling lawns of Long Island University's C. W. Post campus here, students in ski coats and pajama bottoms lope lazily to class. A Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity brother sells raffle tickets in the Hillwood Commons student center. And if not for a small knot of professorial-looking people bearing placards at the front gates, it would be nearly impossible to tell that the university's full-time faculty is on strike.
 "When you look around this campus, it is not like there is this big cloud, because things seem to be going on as normal," said Lisa Chamoff, 20, the editor in chief of the school's weekly newspaper, Pioneer. "I think the strike has not been as effective as the union wanted it to be." 
 But then the union, the C. W. Post Collegial Federation, is well known for both the frequency and brevity of its strikes: this is the fifth since the union was formed in September 1974. The federation's first and perhaps most successful strike, in 1975, lasted five hours and led to the union's first contract, which included a large pay raise. Another, in 1977, was called The Big One by union officials because it lasted three and a half weeks. A 1994 strike ended after three days because, as The Chronicle of Higher Education put it, "almost nobody listened" to the strikers' call for higher pay and a lighter workload. 
Those are the same issues behind the current strike, which began on Feb. 26. Union officials would not say how many of its 318 full-time professors voted for the job action. On Thursday, 85 of them were walking the picket lines at the campus's two main gates. Today, there were times when none could be seen braving the light snow blanketing the picturesque 308-acre campus on Route 25A, which was once the estate of the cereal heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post.
The union and administration officials are to meet with a mediator on Tuesday to reopen talks, which broke off on Feb. 21 after continuing past the Aug. 31 expiration of the most recent three-year contract.
None of the campus's 11,000 full- and part-time students, many of whom are liberal arts, business and health sciences majors, nor its 500 part-time professors, who are in a separate bargaining unit, have joined the picket lines or officially pledged support. And the administration says that more and more full-time professors return to work each day. The number of classes without a faculty member was down to 23 percent on Thursday from 30 percent the day the strike started, said Joseph Shenker, C. W. Post's provost.
And even many strikers cannot seem to shake their devotion to teaching: They are holding courses at a nearby International House of Pancakes, at a pizza parlor, in their homes or on the Internet. And few of their colleagues are criticizing or ostracizing them.
"This strike is very different than what you might think of when you think of a strike," said Joan H. Digby, an English professor at C. W. Post for 32 years who has decided for the first time not to honor a strike. "This time around, the faculty are quite divided over the particular issues at the core of the strike. My friends on the picket line wave and say, 'Good morning.' I don't really feel hostility flowing between these two sides."
Professor Digby said she hoped the divided faculty would find comfort in the words of her literary hero, the 18th-century poet and artist William Blake, who in "The Marriage of Heaven and Hell," wrote, "Without opposites there is no progression." 
Mr. Shenker called the administration's offer to raise salaries by 5 percent in each of the next three years "extremely fair, especially in light of what all the economists are telling us about the status of our financial conditions." He said the average salary for a full-time professor was about $70,000 a year.
Richard Auletta, the union vice president, who has taught German, Spanish and linguistics at the campus for 33 years, acknowledged that the average annual salary was higher than the national average, which the American Association of University Professors said was $58,352 in 1999-2000. But, he said, the cost of living in this New York suburb is higher than in, say, Minneapolis.
The union says it is seeking an 8 percent raise in the first year of a three-year contract and 5 percent in each of the next two years. Equally as important to many on strike is the desire for the administration to remove its cap on the number of faculty members who can be granted a reduced workload of 9 credit hours a week (three classes three times a week) from 12 credit hours a week (four classes three times weekly). 
Nine credit hours a week is the workload of most full-time professors at other colleges nearby and across the country, said Ralph Knopf, the union president, who has taught math at Post for 40 years. The union also wants the school to drop the requirement that professors must perform some "measurable research" to qualify for a nine-hour credit week. "As far as research goes, that is our nature, and we are always doing research anyway," Mr. Knopf said.
These days, students are doing some research of their own. By their calculations, part of their roughly $16,000-a-year tuition (not including room and board) is lost with each canceled class. Although the administration said that only a small number of students had missed classes, the president of the Student Government Association, Oscar M. Jonas, complained that the strike had caused the cancellation of some midterm exams and is becoming stressful for students.
"If a strike continues for much longer, the value of the degrees will be diminished," he said. "Someone has to bend. Somebody has to compromise."

No Earnings, Debatable Prospects: A New I.P.O. With a 90's Feel

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

 BODY:
Get ready for the return of the Internet concept stock. On Thursday, Loudcloud Inc. is expected to offer shares to the public in what seems like a throwback to the dot-com glory days.
 The Silicon Valley company has a constellation of star power rallying behind its chairman, Marc Andreessen, who co-founded Netscape Communications. 
 This time out Mr. Andreessen aims to build and automate corporate Internet systems. His company's software would replace the armies of consultants who maintain these systems, threatening turf occupied by I.B.M. and Electronic Data Systems, as well as Web hosting companies like Exodus Communications. 
Loudcloud has attracted a few big name customers like Ford and Nike, but its technology is still in a gestational phase. So is the company's financial outlook. It is barely a year-and-a-half old and has 575 employees. It has no earnings and no immediate prospect for earnings. With revenues of just $6.6 million, it had losses of $107.6 million from its start in September 1999 through the end of October, with $51 million of that stock option charges. The company says it has signed contracts for $120 million over the next two years.
Its chief obstacle, though, is timing. The market for initial public offerings of technology companies has crashed this year. The public markets have been heaping scorn on technology companies with weak earnings, let alone those that are asking for a multiyear grace period before any profits materialize.
What Loudcloud does have is star power, and plenty of it. In fact, it will be one of the most closely watched public offerings in success-starved Silicon Valley, and on Wall Street. Perhaps it is a sign of how desperate the market has become that Goldman, Sachs and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter have teamed up as co-lead underwriters, a rare pairing roughly equivalent to Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant agreeing to share a basketball.
Loudcloud's investors include the venture capital giant Benchmark Capital and Michael Ovitz, the Hollywood agent. But the real draw is Mr. Andreessen, the 29-year-old technology whiz who is one of a handful of Valley personalities who inspires awe among programmers and technologists, in much the same way as Linus Torvalds, the creator of the Linux operating system. 
"It's the Marc Andreessen, 'can lightning strike twice' scenario," said David Menlow, president of IPOfinancial.com, a New Jersey firm that tracks public offerings. 
Robert C. Stimson, a Merrill Lynch computer services analyst, said he was impressed with Loudcloud's technology, but Mr. Andreessen is the real draw. "A lot of cars are slowing down to take a look at what he's trying to do," he said. "'I buy into his vision," he said, "but it will take us a few years to reach the promise of that vision."
George J. Gilbert, co-manager of the $950 million Northern Technology fund, was more skeptical.
"It's not profitable, and it isn't going to be for a long while," he said. "From an analytical viewpoint, there are no real ways to even guesstimate what kind of profitability this company could have."
Mr. Andreessen has faced long odds before. He was principal creator of the world's first Web browser, Mosaic, and went on to co-found Netscape Communications with Jim Clark. It was Netscape, for those who don't know the story, that sparked the late 90's trend of concept companies going public and garnering huge valuations before they had earned a dollar. 
These are rough times for any public offerings, but especially anything technology related. Last year, there were 236 technology related I.P.O.'s, according to Renaissance Capital, a Greenwich, Conn., firm that tracks and invests in I.P.O.'s. This year, there has been only one new technology offering of note. It is Riverstone Networks, a Santa Clara, Calif., networking company, whose stock was offered at $12 a share on Feb. 15 and closed yesterday at $10.56, down 12 percent.
Many of the stars of 1999 have gone out of business or seen their prices plummet by well over 50 percent. 
"It's a zero," said Andrew J. Kessler of the market for technology offerings. Mr. Kessler runs the $300 million Velocity Capital, a technology hedge fund based in Silicon Valley. 
The soft market has forced Loudcloud to lower its asking price. Initially, it planned to offer 10 million shares at $9 to $11 for about 16 percent of the company. That was later amended to 20 million shares at $8 to $10 for about 30 percent of the company. If it priced in the middle of its range, Loudcloud would have an implied market value of $600 million.
Some money managers wonder if the company will be able to fetch even $8 a share. Melanie Hase, an analyst at Renaissance Capital, says probably, though she calls it a "test for the I.P.O. market."
More than 2 million shareholders of two giant mutual funds managed by Capital Research and Management, one of the nation's largest mutual fund management firms, should pay attention. Capital owns a stake that will be equivalent to 3.6 percent of the company, once it goes public, according to Loudcloud's registration statement. 
The holdings are spread among the $36 billion Growth Fund of America, one of the nation's 10 largest mutual funds, which has 3.6 million shares, and the $10 billion New Economy fund, which has 1.2 million shares of Loudcloud.
Mr. Gilbert, of Northern, said Loudcloud reminded him of Webvan, a struggling online grocer that his fund invested in. These are not fond memories. Webvan fell 97 percent in 2000.
"I bought the story," Mr. Gilbert said. "Fortunately, I realized very soon after that I'd been drinking Kool-Aid."

Times Company Forecasts Slower Growth in Ad Revenue

 BODY:
The New York Times Company said yesterday that the economic slowdown was likely to mean advertising revenue for its newspapers would grow this year by only 1 to 3 percent. That would compare with growth of 11.3 percent in 2000. 
 But the company said it still planned to meet its goal of achieving 10 to 15 percent earnings growth this year through circulation price increases and cost reductions. 
 Within the last six weeks, the Times Company has announced a price increase that has already taken effect for home delivery of the daily issues of its flagship newspaper, The New York Times, and newsstand price increases of Sunday editions of The Times that will take effect on March 25.
The increases, coupled with a circulation price increase last fall at The Boston Globe, which is owned by the Times Company, will produce $30 million to $32 million in additional operating income in 2001, the Times Company said in a news release.
For the current quarter, the company said that diluted earnings per share, excluding special items, were expected to be 35 cents to 38 cents for the first quarter, compared with 47 cents for the first quarter last year. That would be an earnings decline of 19 to 25 percent, compared with last year's first quarter, when earnings grew more than 38 percent.
The announcement by the Times Company followed a cautionary statement two weeks ago from another big newspaper company, Knight Ridder, which forecast a "modest" decline in first quarter earnings. 
The Times Company's newspaper price increases come as Dow Jones & Company plans to raise the cover price of The Wall Street Journal to $1 from 75 cents in April. Yesterday, The Los Angeles Times raised its daily newsstand cover price to 50 cents, from 25 cents, in Southern California.
"This is going to be the worst first quarter the newspaper industry has faced in nearly a decade," said Peter P. Appert, an analyst for Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown. "The macroeconomic variables correlate with trends in ad spending, consumer confidence, existing home sales, auto sales, personal income growth. All of these variables are trending negative."
Catherine Mathis, a Times Company spokeswoman, said yesterday: "The economic environment has clearly softened, and as a result of that we don't think ad revenue growth will be as robust as we did in December. Because it won't be, we have to take steps to achieve our commitment to shareholders of 10 to 15 percent growth. A lot of it is going to come from reducing our costs."
She said that expenses in the company's newspaper division would grow by no more than 2 percent this year. 
In its recent statement, Knight Ridder had said classified advertising was particularly weak. But Ms. Mathis said the Times Company's advertising revenues had been soft "across the board."
Two analysts, Douglas M. Arthur of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Lauren Rich Fine of Merrill Lynch, both said that the industry's sharp advertising downturn in December had seemed to ease slightly in January. 
But their view of the subsequent period diverged. Mr. Arthur said the fall-off resumed or even worsened in February. Ms. Fine was less pessimistic about February, saying, "I don't think things are deteriorating at that rapid a pace."
The stock of the Times Company closed at $43 a share yesterday, down $2.50, or about 5.5 percent. The Standard & Poor's index of newspaper company stocks closed down about 2.6 percent for the day.

HEADLINE: Northeast Says Merger With Con Edison Has Collapsed 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH P. FRIED 

 BODY:
Northeast Utilities, New England's largest energy delivery company, said last night that its planned merger with New York's Consolidated Edison had collapsed, ending the companies' effort to create the largest utility company in the Northeast.
 The development came after the attorney general in Connecticut sought to block the merger on the grounds that it would cost customers more and harm the environment. 
 Despite Northeast Utilities' claims that the merger had collapsed, Con Edison insisted yesterday that the agreement between the two utilities "remains in effect."
The companies entered the merger agreement, which calls on Con Ed to acquire Northeast for $7.5 billion, in October 1999, and shareholders of both companies approved it several months later. At the time, the companies said that by joining together they would be in a better position to provide cheaper power to their customers and to compete more effectively at a time of growing competition amid increasing deregulation. 
With a total of 6.5 million electric and natural-gas customers from Pennsylvania to New Hampshire, the merged company would have been one of the largest utilities in the country.
But not everyone thought the planned union was the blessing described by its advocates. One of the fiercest opponents, Attorney General Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, has been waging a lawsuit in Connecticut Superior Court to block the deal, arguing that it would be bad for energy customers, the economy and the environment in his state because Con Ed has an "abysmal record of high rates, poor quality service and environmental disrespect."
In saying last night that the merger deal was dead, Northeast Utilities said that Con Ed had told it earlier in the day that "it was not willing to close the parties' pending merger on the previously agreed upon terms." As a result, Northeast said in its statement, it had "notified Con Edison that it was treating its refusal to proceed" on the previously agreed terms "as a repudiation and breach of the merger agreement."
Michael G. Morris, the chairman and president of Northeast, said his company was "treating the agreement as effectively terminated."
Northeast did not say what issues had caused the merger deal to founder, but its statement suggested that Con Ed might have developed reservations about Northeast's financial condition that prompted a request for changes in the agreement.
In any case, Northeast said it would file a lawsuit "to obtain the benefits of the transaction as negotiated for Northeast Utilities' shareholders."
Mary Jo Keating, Northeast's vice president for corporate communications, said she could not comment on what Northeast would argue were the lost benefits to its shareholders or how much the lost benefits would amount to.
In its statement, Con Edison said there were questions regarding Northeast's financial prospects.
As an example of its concerns, the utility cited the question of whether an unregulated Northeast subsidiary, Select Energy, could satisfy its supply obligations under the merger agreement. Select Energy sells power and other energy services, and Con Ed said Select's failure to meet its obligations would "pose a significant risk" in Northeast's unregulated businesses.
The Con Edison statement did not say what kind of changes it wanted in the merger agreement, and a spokesman for the utility, Michael Clendenin, declined to provide the information.
Late last year, it appeared that the merger agreement was in peril for another reason: Connecticut's department of public utility control approved it with conditions that Con Ed said at the time "so significantly changes the economic effects and risks of the merger that it calls into serious question whether the transaction will be completed."
The conditions included a 3 percent cut in the distribution rates that customers in Connecticut are charged, and acceptance by the combined company of a $60 million loss in costs stemming from the deregulation process.
But last night, Mr. Clendenin said that the state department had modified the conditions to some degree, and he suggested that Con Ed's financial concerns had become the main roadblock.

HEADLINE: Index of Service Industry Rebounds Slightly 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
A measure largely representing the service sector steadied in February, a new survey showed yesterday. 
 The National Association of Purchasing Management said yesterday that its nonmanufacturing business index rose to 51.7 from January's 50.1, which was the lowest since the report's inception in July 1997. A reading above 50 means activity is expanding, while below 50 indicates contraction. 
 The nonmanufacturing survey is a companion report to a survey of factory purchasing managers and mainly reflects service industries.
The increase, together with the first rise in a year in the manufacturing index, "reinforces the notion that January was a low" for the economy, said Steven Wieting, an economist with Salomon Smith Barney in New York.
Still, "the idea of a recovery is very tentative at this point," he said.
For the nonmanufacturing report, the association gathers statistics from more than 370 purchasing executives in more than 62 industries, including utilities, law firms, hospitals, construction companies, government, retailers and electronic commerce.
The degree of economic weakness in January was also seen in a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.
The Chicago Fed's new index was - 0.55 in January versus - 0.79 in December. The bank, which developed the index, released it for the first time yesterday. The reading was the lowest since a reading of - 1.13 in January 1996, based on previously published data gathered by the Chicago Fed.
The Chicago Fed national index draws on 85 indicators that gauge production and income, employment and hours, consumer spending, housing starts and sales, manufacturing and inventories. It is based on the work of James Stock of Harvard and Mark Watson of Princeton, which was published in 1999 in The Journal of Monetary Economics.
"The negative January reading should be interpreted as continuing evidence of national economic growth below trend," the report said. "The January index does not currently point to an economy in recession."
A separate survey showed that businesses announced plans to cut 101,731 jobs last month, 28 percent below the 142,208 cuts announced in January. The number of announced cuts in January was the highest since the outplacement firm of Challenger, Gray & Christmas started the survey eight years ago.
Even with a decline, it was the first time the number of job cuts surpassed 100,000 for three consecutive months.

North Korea Concessions Were Wider Than Thought
The Clinton administration's negotiations with North Korea late last year apparently made more progress than thought, though the decision not to pursue them to conclusion is still hotly debated. According to current and former government experts, Kim Jong Il promised not to produce, test or deploy missiles with a range of more than 300 miles and offered to halt the sale of missiles, components, technology and training. A1

Livestock Virus Fear in France
French officials said traces of foot-and-mouth disease had been found in sheep on nine farms in five regions, raising alarm that Britain's outbreak of the virus had crossed the English Channel. The affected animals were destroyed and the authorities were awaiting results of tests to determine whether the animals were carrying a live virus. A4

Aftermath of Bridge Collapse
Portugal's public works minister, Jorge Coelho, resigned and accepted "political responsibility" for the collapse of a 116-year-old bridge over the Douro River on Sunday night that led to the deaths of more than 60 people in a bus and two cars. A9

Israeli Cabinet Is Complete
Prime Minister-elect Ariel Sharon put together the final pieces of his unity government. Police officers stood guard throughout the country in a state of high alert, braced for the possibility of more terror bombings like the one that killed three Israelis and wounded scores more on Sunday. A4

Russia Demands Explanation
The Foreign Ministry summoned the American charge d'affaires, George Krol, to demand an explanation for reports that United States intelligence services had dug a tunnel under the Soviet Embassy in Washington in the 1980's. A3

Cheney Hospitalized To Clear Blocked Artery
Vice President Dick Cheney, who has had four heart attacks, was hospitalized in Washington to clear a partly blocked artery after he complained of chest pains. His cardiologist said preliminary indications showed no evidence that Mr. Cheney, 60, had had another heart attack or that his heart had been further damaged. The doctor said he expected Mr. Cheney to go back to work this week. A1

Mr. Cheney's hospital admission was caused not by progression of his heart disease but by a common complication of the stent procedure he had in November, his doctors said. A16

Mr. Cheney will donate to charity his remaining options to buy stock in Halliburton, the energy services company he headed until last year. A15

Submarine Accident Inquiry
An investigator testified at a naval court of inquiry that the submarine Greeneville was behind schedule at the time it surfaced and struck a Japanese fishing trawler, sinking it and killing nine people. A10

Court Takes Liability Case
The Supreme Court agreed to decide whether private companies that run prisons or perform other traditionally governmental functions for the federal government can be sued for constitutional violations committed by their employees. A17

Report on Political Ad Costs
Local television stations may have reaped as much as $1 billion last year by "gouging" political advertisers, according to a report that concludes that broadcasters are raising the price of political advertising for their own profit while campaign costs spiral out of control. Broadcasters disputed the finding, saying prices were driven up by third-party issue advertisements and by a fee structure that benefits media buyers for candidates. A16

2 Killed in School Shooting
A 15-year-old high school freshman whose threats about taking a gun to school had apparently been shrugged off opened fire at Santana High School, in a San Diego suburb, killing 2 fellow students and wounding 13 other people with a pistol, officials said. The authorities said the boy, identified as Charles Andrew Williams, would be charged as an adult with murder, assault and weapons possession. A1

The monstrous winter storm that forecasters had predicted for days would pound the metropolitan region did not live up to expectations, though points farther north did experience some severe weather. Local governments, transportation services, schools and businesses that had curtailed activities in the New York City area as a precaution had to cope only with a sputtering drizzle and a moderate snowfall. Airlines canceled hundreds of flights in response to forecasts, but Kennedy, La Guardia and Newark airports remained open. A1

HEADLINE: Losses in Online Ventures Cut Pearson's Profit 17% 

BYLINE:  By SUZANNE KAPNER 

DATELINE: LONDON, March 5 

 BODY:
Heedless of the poor marks investors now give companies that keep pouring money into money-losing Internet ventures, Pearson P.L.C., the British media and educational publishing company, said today that it had stepped up such spending fivefold last year, lopping 17 percent off its pretax profit for 2000 in the process.
 With media holdings ranging from The Financial Times and The Economist to Penguin Books and a huge educational publishing arm, Pearson had been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the online boom. 
 Pearson's shares rose to a high of $:23.01 ($33.82) a year ago as investors bet that it would convert its dominant positions in publishing and education into a lucrative online currency. 
Now, like most other companies that have spent heavily on Internet ventures that have yet to make money, Pearson is facing investors who are impatient for profits at a time when an economic slowdown threatens to undermine growth in its offline businesses.
"Pearson had been viewed as a one-way bet," said Paul Richards, an analyst with WestLB Panmure. "But people are now realizing you can't have double-digit growth indefinitely."
For the year, Pearson earned $:333 million ($489.5 million) in pretax profit, including $:196 million ($288 million) spent on Internet ventures. That compares with $:402 million ($591 million) in pretax profit the year earlier.
Mr. Richards said he was more cautious of the company's prospects for 2001 given that growth in advertising revenue and school budgets are likely to slow, along with the United States economy, from which Pearson derived 60 percent of its profit and 64 percent of its revenue last year.
Shares of Pearson fell 4.1 percent, or 64 pence, to $:14.97 in trading today in London.
Over the last three years, under its chief executive, Marjorie Scardino, Pearson has undergone a major overhaul, jettisoning noncore assets and using the money to make acquisitions. Now analysts say that Mrs. Scardino must integrate the new businesses and grow the company in a more challenging economic environment.
Already signs of a slowdown are visible. 
Luke Swanson, a Pearson spokesman, said advertising sales for the first two months of the year are up 8 percent, compared with a 34 percent increase for the comparable period last year.
Mr. Swanson said that only 10 percent of Pearson's sales came from advertising, while about half the company's revenue was generated from educational publishing, an area that Pearson expected to contract less rapidly.
For instance, Mr. Swanson suggested that the number of standardized tests that American children take each year would increase sharply under President Bush's education proposals, pointing to a model developed under Mr. Bush's tenure as governor in Texas. Any such increase would be a boon to National Computer Systems, one of the country's largest standardized testing companies, which Pearson acquired last year.
For the moment, that potential is somewhat veiled by Pearson's willingness to funnel money into Internet ventures like the online version of The Financial Times, which lost $:113 million ($166 million) last year, or triple the prior year's losses. Likewise the Learning Network, an educational portal, lost $:83 million, ($122 million) while only generating $:3 million ($4.4 million) in revenue last year.
Mr. Swanson said that Internet spending in 2001 would decline as revenue for both divisions are projected to rise, with the online publishing arm forecasted to break even in 2002 and the portal to follow suit a year later.

HEADLINE: Treasury Secretary to Keep Stake in Alcoa 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT and DIANA B. HENRIQUES 

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill has decided to keep about $100 million in Alcoa stock and options, giving him perhaps the largest single-company holding that a top government official has ever held.
 Mr. O'Neill's decision, which was stated in a letter to a government ethics official in January and reiterated in a television interview on Sunday, stands in contrast to moves by other government officials in recent years who diversified their investments upon taking office. 
 Just yesterday, Vice President Dick Cheney said he would donate to charity the profits from his remaining stock options in Halliburton, the oil-services giant. 
Mr. Cheney was the chief executive of Halliburton until last year, and Mr. O'Neill was chairman or chief executive of Alcoa, the large aluminum maker, from 1987 until late last year.
Mr. O'Neill has said he will recuse himself from all Treasury Department decisions concerning Alcoa. Appearing Sunday on the NBC News program "Meet the Press," Mr. O'Neill said he had received clearance from government ethics experts to hold onto the shares.
But some government and corporate analysts said that Mr. O'Neill's decision raised a host of potential problems. Alcoa, with $22.9 billion in revenue last year, sells its products around the world and is affected by many trade regulations. It also has many clients in regulated industries like aerospace and railroads.
"It's an inherent conflict of interest," said Judith Fischer, publisher of Executive Compensation Reports, a newsletter. "It's also a distraction."
Charles Lewis, the executive director of the Center for Public Integrity, a nonpartisan research group in Washington, added, "Everyone at Treasury and everyone in the Bush administration will know 'Mr. Alcoa' is the treasury secretary. That does raise some issues."
Mr. O'Neill's decision differs both from Mr. Cheney's and those of some recent cabinet secretaries. In 1993, when Robert Rubin joined the Clinton administration as an economic adviser, he said he was severing his financial ties with Goldman, Sachs & Company, the investment bank at which he had been co-chairman, and establishing a blind trust. Mr. Rubin became treasury secretary in 1995.
In 1989, James A. Baker III, the new secretary of state under President George Bush, sold millions of dollars worth of stock in Chemical Bank and other companies after being criticized for holding them. Economists at the time said that Mr. Baker would shape policy regarding international debt, which in turn would affect Chemical Bank's stock.
But Mr. Baker had held the stock when he was treasury secretary in the mid-1980's. Like Mr. O'Neill, he said he would recuse himself from decisions affecting the company when he took office.
In 1989, though, Mr. Baker told the adviser managing his investments to sell the stock. "While I believe this decision goes well beyond what is required or has been recommended," Mr. Baker said in a statement then, "I think it is the correct decision for someone committed to meeting the highest ethical standards."
During last year's presidential campaign, Mr. Cheney said he would sell all his Halliburton stock if he and George W. Bush were elected.
In August, Mr. Cheney made $20.6 million by selling his shares and exercising all eligible stock options. Yesterday, a lawyer for Mr. Cheney said the remaining options -- those that cannot yet be turned into stock or that currently have no value -- would be donated to the University of Wyoming; Capital Partners for Education, which provides financial aid for low-income students attending private high schools in Washington; and the George Washington University Medical Faculty Associates, which will establish a cardiac institute bearing Mr. Cheney's name.
Mr. O'Neill owned about 2.4 million shares of Alcoa stock, worth about $80 million, at the end of 2000, according to the company's most recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. He also held 3.8 million stock options.
Stock options, which give their holder the right to buy stock at a fixed price regardless of the shares' current value, have become the most lucrative form of executive pay in the last decade. Mr. O'Neill, for example, made $53 million last year converting Alcoa options into stock. 
On "Meet the Press," he said he had never sold any Alcoa stock. That suggests he still owns the shares he bought last year with his options.
At the end of last year, his 3.8 million remaining options were worth about $11 million, the company said. Their value could rise sharply if Alcoa's stock rises in the coming years. Already, company shares are worth about $4.60 more than they were on Dec. 31, meaning Mr. O'Neill's options could be worth more than twice what they were at the end of last year.
Mr. Cheney still holds 433,333 options to buy Halliburton stock, and he and his wife, Lynne, also received options from four other corporations on whose boards one of them had served: EDS, Procter & Gamble, Anadarko Petroleum and Lockheed Martin, according to Terrence O'Donnell, a lawyer for Mr. Cheney.
During the campaign, Mr. Cheney said he was "fully prepared to forfeit any options that had not vested by the time I assume office."
That sounded like he intended to have Halliburton cancel the unvested options. But actually, according to his legal advisers, Mr. Cheney forfeited any personal stake in those options by arranging for any eventual profits to be given to the three charities he designated.
"We went back and reviewed all of the statements he made during the campaign," said Mr. O'Donnell last night. "We believe that this meets his commitments fully."
On Jan. 18, Mr. Cheney and his wife signed an irrevocable agreement giving an independent administrator the power to decide when to exercise the options, and directs the administrator to donate the after-tax proceeds to the charities.
The University of Wyoming and the George Washington University medical group will each receive 40 percent of the proceeds from the Cheneys' remaining options. Capital Partners for Education will get the remaining 20 percent. The gift arrangement is intended to be "100-percent tax-neutral," Mr. O'Donnell said, with taxes the Cheneys owe on any profits offsetting the charitable deduction they can claim.
Spokesmen for Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans said that they would soon release information on their financial holdings.

HEADLINE: Bush to Name Fed Governor For 2nd Term 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 5 

 BODY:
The White House said today that President Bush would nominate Roger W. Ferguson Jr., the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, to another term on the central bank's governing board.
 The appointment was the first by Mr. Bush to the Fed. It followed public and private efforts on Mr. Ferguson's behalf by Alan Greenspan, the central bank's chairman. 
 Mr. Ferguson was first appointed to the Fed by President Clinton in 1997. He became vice chairman of the board two years later. His job had been in limbo since last year, when Senator Phil Gramm, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, blocked Mr. Clinton's reappointment of Mr. Ferguson as a Fed governor. Senator Gramm said the next president should have a chance to place his own nominee on the Fed.
In a statement, Mr. Ferguson said he was "delighted" by the news. Mr. Greenspan said in a statement that he welcomed Mr. Bush's decision.
"Roger Ferguson has been a distinguished and respected member of the Federal Reserve Board, exercising sound judgment and benefiting our work on a wide range of domestic and international policy matters," Mr. Greenspan said.
Mr. Gramm's spokeswoman, Christi Harlan, said he would have no comment.
The White House also announced today that Mr. Bush would nominate Kenneth W. Dam, a law professor at the University of Chicago who was deputy secretary of state in the Reagan administration, to be deputy treasury secretary.
Mr. Dam, whose appointment was expected, also worked at the Office of Management and Budget and on the White House economic policy staff during the Nixon administration. He was also a senior executive at I.B.M. from 1985 to 1992, and a director of Alcoa, whose longtime chairman, Paul H. O'Neill, is now the Treasury secretary.
Mr. Dam has written extensively about foreign policy, trade, finance and tax policy. He will become a member of a Treasury team that will also include John B. Taylor, an economist from Stanford University who has been nominated by Mr. Bush as undersecretary for international affairs, and Peter R. Fisher, an executive vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, who is expected to be named undersecretary for domestic finance soon.
Mr. Bush's decision to reappoint Mr. Ferguson to the Fed leaves two open seats on the Fed's seven-member board. In addition, the terms of two more seats, those held by Laurence H. Meyer and Edward W. Kelley Jr., will expire during Mr. Bush's term in office.
Mr. Greenspan's current term as chairman, his fourth, will expire in 2004, when he will be 78.
As a result, Mr. Bush has a chance to put a strong imprint on the Fed.
The president technically nominated Mr. Ferguson to fill a board seat that runs for another 13 years.
Although Mr. Ferguson's previous term on the board expired last year, Fed rules permitted him to continue to serve until he was reappointed or someone else was nominated for the job.
The vice chairman's post is filled from among board members. Mr. Ferguson's four-year term in that position expires in 2003.
On monetary policy, Mr. Ferguson's views are close to those of Mr. Greenspan.
Like Mr. Greenspan, he has become increasingly convinced that heavy investments in technology have made American businesses more productive than they were a decade ago, giving the economy more room to expand without generating inflation.
Mr. Ferguson has also been heavily involved in banking regulation. The Fed has taken a somewhat more restrictive view than Congressional Republicans of how much freedom large financial services companies should have to take advantage of the blurring lines between traditional commercial banking and investment banking.

HEADLINE: How Politics Sank Accord on Missiles With North Korea 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 5 

 BODY:
Wendy R. Sherman brought along an extra suitcase of cold-weather gear even when she joined Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright for a December trip through Africa. 
 As the Clinton administration's senior policy coordinator on North Korea, Ms. Sherman was prepared to fly to Pyongyang on a moment's notice. Her task there would be to clear away the final barriers to an accord that would neutralize the North Korean missile threat, which has been a central justification for the hotly debated American national missile defense project. Had she succeeded, the framework of an agreement would have been signed by President Clinton and Kim Jong Il, the North Korean leader, in Pyongyang, the North's capital. 
 But Ms. Sherman never made the trip. 
In a decision that is still hotly debated by national security experts, the Clinton administration put North Korea diplomacy aside while the Republican and Democratic presidential contenders wrestled over the vote count in Florida, a decision that Clinton aides have sought to justify on the premise that the president could not travel abroad during a potential constitutional crisis.
By the time the dust settled in Florida, and confronting a lukewarm response from the victorious Republicans, Mr. Clinton's team reluctantly decided that it had run out of time.
"Although there were still critical details to be worked out, it appeared that an agreement was within reach," Ms. Sherman said in an interview this week, reflecting the dominant view in the Clinton team.
The episode remains vitally relevant because the North Korean missile threat has been the driving force behind the debate in Washington over missile defenses, and because President Bush has yet to declare whether he plans to carry through or modify the Clinton strategy. 
The Bush team has been generally skeptical about North Korea, and it is not clear how much they will use diplomacy to try to head off missile threats, instead of relying primarily on their plans for missile defense. 
The South Korean president, Kim Dae Jung, who will meet with Mr. Bush on Wednesday, is expected to press the new administration to engage with Pyongyang. And while the negotiations are still shrouded in secrecy, they apparently made more progress than generally thought.
According to current and former government experts, Kim Jong Il promised in confidential talks not to produce, test or deploy missiles with a range of more than 300 miles. That offer would prevent North Korea from fielding missiles that could strike the United States. 
North Korea, the experts said, also offered to halt the sale of missiles, missile components, technology and training. The pledge would ban systems that North Korea had already contracted to provide to aspiring third world powers.
And North Korea dropped its demand that it be paid cash for giving up its long-range missile programs.
Several important issues remained unresolved, including how to verify the agreements; whether North Korea was willing to destroy missiles it had already produced, and the value of the nonmonetary aid North Korea should receive in lieu of cash.
"We got further than we thought was possible on the missile issue," one government specialist said. "But there is still more work to do on the details before we know if we will have something substantial."
When it comes to ballistic missiles, North Korea has been a major source of concern for Washington. North Korea shocked American defense experts when it tried to put a satellite into orbit in August 1998 on a Taepo Dong-1 missile. 
The attempt failed when the solid-fuel third stage exploded. And the Taepo Dong-1 lacked the ability to reach American territory with a nuclear payload. 
But experts were worried that with time, North Korea would field a more capable successor, the Taepo Dong-2, which could threaten the United States. North Korea is also one of the major sellers of missile technology around the world. The Iranian and Pakistani missile programs, for instance, are heavily dependent on North Korean technology. 
The Taepo Dong test and a general deterioration in relations between Pyongyang and Washington prompted the Clinton administration to ask former Defense Secretary William J. Perry to conduct a policy review.
Traveling to Pyongyang in May 1999, Mr. Perry told the North Koreans that there were two paths they could follow: cooperation, or a collision course with the United States and its Asian allies.
If North Korea chose cooperation, Mr. Perry advised, it needed to give up its missile program. Specifically, the North Koreans should agree not to sell or deploy missiles that exceeded the guidelines of the Missile Technology Control Regime -- that is, missiles that can carry an 1,100-pound payload more than 180 miles.
Mr. Perry recalled in an interview that he was initially discouraged by what he heard in Pyongyang.
But the Korea experts on Mr. Perry's team detected a shift in the North Korean stance, and over the next 18 months, developments appeared to prove them right. 
North Korea declared a moratorium on its long-range missile tests, and in June, Kim Jong Il and Kim Dae Jung met. And as the clock wound down on the Clinton administration in September, it was asked to receive a high-level Korean envoy. 
The envoy was Vice Marshal Cho Myong Rok, the head of the North Korean military, and his visit was taken by most Clinton aides as an indication that Mr. Kim was trying to bring his skeptical generals around. 
"I think Kim poked his head out of the groundhog hole, looked around and decided that his regime is not sustainable unless it is somehow connected with the rest of the world," Samuel R. Berger, Mr. Clinton's national security adviser, said today. 
Marshal Cho also brought an invitation for Mr. Clinton to visit Pyonyang -- and thus underscored a fundamentally different approach to diplomacy. While media-conscious American administrations prefer to carry out painstaking negotiations in advance for a carefully scripted summit meeting, the authoritarian Kim Jong Il believed that agreements should first be resolved at the highest level, leaving details to be worked out later by subordinates.
The invitation also underscored the enormous political value the North Korean government attached to a visit by the American president, seeing a Clinton visit would signify an end to enmity and acceptance by the international community.
Marshal Cho offered the Americans something they wanted as well. He reaffirmed an earlier proposal that Mr. Kim had raised with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia: that North Korea was willing to forgo its long-range missiles if the West would agreed to launch civilian satellites for Pyongyang. 
The Clinton administration decided to send Dr. Albright to Pyongyang to see if there was the basis for a Clinton trip. Her visit narrowed the gap with the North Koreas still further and challenged the Western image of Mr. Kim as an irrational leader. 
Zippered up in a khaki jump suit, Mr. Kim offered several important concessions during six hours of talks. He offered to "forgo" missiles with a range of more than 300 miles. That concession was tied to an American willingness to provide satellite-launching services.
He also indicated that he was willing to halt all missile exports, including missile components, technical advice and brokering services. And North Korea was no longer asking for a $1 billion a year in cash in return, but was prepared to accept $1 billion worth of nonmonetary assistance, like food, coal or other commodities for its stricken economy.
Little progress was made on verification. The North Korean leader insisted that Washington had adequate means to monitor compliance through satellite and other technical means and did not welcome intrusive inspections. 
North Korea's existing stock of missiles was another big issue. Mr. Kim's offer to forgo long-range missiles did not apply to weapons that the North had already produced. 
Defense Secretary William S. Cohen and the Joint Chiefs of Staff wanted the North Koreans to destroy their missile stocks, which were a threat to Japan and to American troops in South Korea. Still, the mood at the Pyongyang meetings was good. Mr. Kim invited Dr. Albright to a huge Communist-style celebration by his party in which workers held colored placards in the shape of the Taepo-Dong missile. The North Korean leader turned to Dr. Albright and said this was the first satellite launching and would be the last.
To iron out the remaining differences and set the stage for a summit meeting, the Clinton administration organized expert-level talks in the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur.
But without Mr. Kim, the North's experts had no authority to negotiate. When the Americans tried to clarify Pyongyang's position, the North Koreans complained that their move was an insult.
To keep the negotiations moving, the American team gave the North Koreans two documents: a draft framework agreement that could be made public and signed at a summit meeting, and a confidential letter outlining each side's obligations.
Those obligations went beyond the proposals Mr. Kim had made in Pyongyang. The Americans wanted to ban the production, testing and deployment of all missiles with a range of more than 180 miles that could carry a 1,000-pound payload -- the same standard that Mr. Perry had cited in his 1999 talks. 
The Americans also wanted verification provisions, including a declaration by the North Koreans of the numbers and types of missiles in their arsenal. And the Americans pressed the North Koreans for a commitment to destroy their existing stocks, although some officials would have settled for a promise to negotiate this in the future.
The Americans did not quantify how much assistance they were willing to provide North Korea, though they reportedly considered providing several hundred million dollars a years worth of food aid.
Before the administration could consider a Clinton trip, it was clear there would have to be another session in which the North's negotiators could consult with the one man who could make decisions: Kim Jong Il.
So plans were made to send Ms. Sherman and a team of Pentagon, National Security Council and State Department officials to Pyongyang. Ms. Sherman would be authorized to give the North Koreans a date for a Clinton summit meeting if they made more concessions on missiles. 
In an ideal world, officials said, Ms. Sherman would have gone to Pyongyang in November, and if the North Koreans made the needed concessions, she could have arranged a Clinton visit. He would then have signed a broadly written accord, while verification and other technical issues were tackled later.
But the election wrangle intruded. Mr. Berger was reluctant to send an envoy with the election in doubt. He said the administration did not deem it wise for the president to leave the country at the time of a potential "constitutional crisis."
As the weeks dragged on, Dr. Albright and Ms. Sherman kept an anxious eye on Florida. At one point, they were monitoring the Florida events from Mauritius, wondering if the Korea operation would proceed. 
After the election was decided in mid-December, Ms. Sherman and the White House Asia expert, Jack Pritchard, briefed Colin L. Powell and Condoleezza Rice. The Bush team made it clear that it would not undercut Mr. Clinton, but not would it endorse a deal, former Clinton aides said. That attitudewas one factor that led the Clinton team not to send Ms. Sherman, according to a former ranking Clinton official. The concern was that the new administration would not support or even complete a deal hammered out then. 
Finally, the Clinton administration announced on Dec. 29 that there was no longer enough time for its talks. 
Critics inside and outside the government say Mr. Clinton made a mistake by not sending Ms. Sherman ahead. The White House, they say, could have consulted with the Bush team before the election was decided, but refrained for fear of lending legitimacy to Mr. Bush's claims to the White House. 
"They did not run out of time; they ran out of courage," said Leon V. Sigal, the author of a book on Korean diplomacy.
Dr. Albright insists that the administration did the best it could. But even she has some regrets.
"Of the various places in the world where there is a chance to change the dynamic, this was it," she said last week. "Do I regret that we did not go forward? I personally do. I wish we could have."

HEADLINE: Australia Set to Auction Mobile Phone Licenses 

BYLINE:  By BECKY GAYLORD

DATELINE: SYDNEY, Australia, March 6 

 BODY:
The auction for third-generation mobile phone licenses in Australia, scheduled to begin on March 15, is progressing more smoothly than recent sales in some other countries. The timetable is on track, and a range of companies, both domestic and multinational, recently paid deposits to participate.
 But as with some other recent sales, the revenues are expected to be disappointing. Analysts say that the government is unlikely to get the 2.6 billion Australian dollars ($1.4 billion) that it is counting on from spectrum sales to help generate an election-year budget surplus because of the softening in the telecommunications market and because consolidation in the domestic industry may reduce demand. 
 Most of the proceeds from the spectrum sales were to have come from this auction of third-generation, or 3G, wireless licenses, which are expected to allow carriers to offer advanced Internet services on mobile phones and other hand-held devices. But many analysts are saying it may bring in only about 1.2 billion dollars ($636 million), a price just above the lowest amount the government said it would accept.
Seven companies plan to bid for the 15-year licenses, which will run from October 2002.
Telstra, Australia's No. 1 telecommunications company, is among the bidders for up to four licenses that cover the nation. The second- and third-largest, Cable and Wireless Optus and Vodafone Pacific, both units of British companies, are also involved, as well as AAPT Spectrum, part of the Telecom Corporation of New Zealand; Hutchison Telecommunications Australia, majority-owned by Hutchison Whampoa of Hong Kong; and 3G Investments (Australia), a subsidiary of Qualcomm, the digital wireless communications company based in San Diego.
CKW Wireless, a unit of the American wireless technology group ArrayComm, is eligible to bid for a regional license.
Global pressures, including volatile telecommunications stock prices, rising corporate debt levels and weak demand for the licenses, have prompted some countries to delay their third-generation spectrum sales. Singapore, Brazil and Switzerland recently postponed their auctions; France, too, has had delays. Last year, auctions in Italy, Austria and the Netherlands brought in far less than had been expected.
The Australian government has resisted calls to delay its auction. Among the concerns was how the expected sale of Cable and Wireless Optus would affect it. Because the Vodafone Group and Telecom New Zealand plan to bid for Optus, the outcome of that "vastly changes the whole situation" for the third-generation auction, said Paul Budde, who runs a telecommunications research and consulting firm in Sydney.
Prime Minister John Howard's determination to push ahead with the sale can be traced, in part, to the federal election that will be called later this year. His conservative coalition government has predicted a federal budget surplus of 4.3 billion dollars ($2.3 billion) for the year ending June 30, an amount that relies significantly on the government's anticipated proceeds from this auction.
Last year, when the government first estimated that the spectrum sales would fetch 2.6 billion dollars, the projection seemed modest. But the Australian telecommunications industry has weakened considerably since then, part of a global downturn.
Moreover, the actual budget surplus is already likely to be lower than earlier estimates because economic growth and employment have slowed. The surplus forecast was further trimmed last week by 1.5 billion dollars ($795 million) when Mr. Howard cut a fuel tax to appease voters.

HEADLINE: New Worries Of Slowdown Spur Canada To Cut Rates 

BYLINE:  By TIMOTHY PRITCHARD

DATELINE: TORONTO, March 6 

 BODY:
Worried that the United States economy is losing steam more rapidly than expected and that its appetite for goods from Canada will flag, the Canadian central bank reduced short-term interest rates by half a percentage point today to try to stimulate domestic demand.
 The Bank of Canada reduced the benchmark bank rate to 5.25 percent from 5.75 percent, which effectively lowered the rate it charges on overnight loans to Canadian banks to 5 percent. Leading Canadian banks quickly responded with matching reductions in their prime lending rates, to 6.75 percent, effective on Wednesday. 
 In a statement announcing the reduction, the Bank of Canada said today that "the slowdown in the U.S. economy in the first half of 2001 could be more pronounced than expected," and in Canada, "recent information suggests that the positive underlying momentum in the economy was somewhat less strong than had previously been estimated." 
Analysts saw deeper worries beneath the measured language of the announcement.
"The Bank of Canada is clearly much more concerned about the economic outlook than they are letting on," said Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Nesbitt Burns Inc., a brokerage house in Toronto. The half-point cut "is a moderate surprise, especially given the bank's bullish rhetoric on the economy."
David A. Dodge, the new governor of the central bank, gave a speech two weeks ago on Canada's economic prospects that was taken by many analysts as signaling a quarter-point rate cut today, rather than the half-point cut the bank announced. 
Other government officials, notably the finance minister, Paul Martin, have been saying that Canada would be largely insulated from a slowdown in the United States because its economy had become more diversified in recent years. 
But Canada still depends on the United States for 80 percent of its merchandise trade, and some important domestic indicators here have been weakening. 
Gross domestic product grew 2.6 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with 4.5 percent in the third. Manufacturing output fell by 0.7 percent in December, and new job creation collapsed, although the unemployment rate rose only slightly, to 6.9 percent.
Economists, who had generally forecast growth of 3 percent or greater in 2001, have been lowering their estimates to the 2 percent range despite a personal tax cut at the start of the year that was meant to stimulate demand. 
Still, many economists agreed with the central bank's view that business activity would rebound on both sides of the border in the second half as the stimulus of lower interest rates took hold. 
Before last fall, the Bank of Canada generally set its rates by quickly matching whatever moves were made by the Federal Reserve Board in the United States. Now it sets dates in advance for announcements like today's about whether interest rate policy will be changed. 
The next announcement by the bank is scheduled for April 17, although the bank could move sooner, especially if the Fed makes another half-point reduction at its March 20 meeting, as some forecasters expect.

HEADLINE: China Rejects Allegations On Improving Iraqi Weapons 

BYLINE:  By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING, March 6 

 BODY:
After conducting "serious investigations," China has rejected American allegations that Chinese companies helped improve Iraqi air defenses in violation of United Nations sanctions, the foreign minister said today. 
 At a news conference on the second day of China's annual Parliament meeting, Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan also warned the United States of grave consequences if it sold Taiwan advanced weapons systems, an issue that may come to the forefront next month, when the United States is to decide on Taiwan's arms requests. 
 Underscoring China's determination to press Taiwan to rejoin the "motherland" with force if necessary, even if it means some day confronting American might, China also announced that military spending this year would increase 17.7 percent, accelerating its drive for a more powerful and modern military. 
Last month, after American and British warplanes bombed what they said were enhanced Iraqi air defenses, the United States said it had evidence that Chinese companies were selling and installing fiber optic cables and other equipment being used to improve antiaircraft equipment in Iraq. 
Chinese officials initially denied the contentions, but their position then seemed to soften. Now the government has declared its sometimes freewheeling international technology companies to be innocent of any improper aid or sales to Iraq. 
"Relevant agencies in China have carried out some serious investigations," Mr. Tang said. "Chinese enterprises and corporations have not assisted Iraq in building the project of fiber optic cable for air defense." 
In Washington, a spokeswoman for the National Security Council, Mary Ellen Countryman, said: "The Chinese government has reiterated its understanding of China's responsibilities to uphold U.N. Security Council resolutions and to insure that Chinese companies abide by these resolutions. We will continue to work with the Chinese government to address this issue."
Ms. Countryman did not say whether the United States considered the incident closed.
Mr. Tang's wording appeared to leave open a possibility that a Chinese company had worked on nonmilitary telecommunications in Iraq, but he insisted that China had carefully obeyed the sanctions. 
China's top foreign policy official, Deputy Prime Minister Qian Qichen, will visit Washington on March 18 for the first high-level contacts with the United States since President Bush took office, meetings that both sides see as potentially pivotal. Mr. Tang said today that Chinese-American relations could "continue to move forward," but only if "the American side handles the question of Taiwan well." 
China is waging a diplomatic offensive to head off Taiwan's requests to buy warships equipped with the advanced Aegis radar system, which could be used against Chinese planes and missiles, and upgraded versions of Patriot missiles. 
"The American side should come to a recognition of the serious dangers involved" in providing such weapons, Mr. Tang said. 
"It should rein in its wild horse right on the edge of the precipice," he added, using a Chinese adage. 
Releasing the national budget this morning, Finance Minister Xiang Huaicheng said official military spending for the year would increase 17.7 percent over last year, putting the total at just over $17 billion. But Western experts said true military spending might be two to three times that amount and it is unclear whether part of the announced increase includes a shift of expenditures into the announced budget. 
Seeking to modernize its huge but modestly trained and equipped forces, China has increased its announced military budget by more than 10 percent a year for more than 10 years, and has purchased advanced Russian arms from a separate budget. Still, this year's increase appears to represent an acceleration compared with last year's 12.7 percent.
Mr. Xiang said the increase was mainly to raise military salaries but also reflected "the need to adapt to drastic changes in the military situation of the world and prepare for defense and combat given the conditions of modern technology." The government also provided new funds to offset revenues lost when the military was forced to give up industries.
Even if unreported spending is included, China's military budget remains small compared with that of the United States. 
Mr. Tang also confirmed reports that China and Russia would sign an unusual treaty on "good-neighborly friendship and cooperation" in July, when President Jiang Zemin visits Moscow. 
At the news conference, Mr. Tang spoke in scathing terms about Washington's recent annual report on human rights in various countries including China, calling it hypocritical.

HEADLINE: Productivity Grew by 2.2% In 4th Quarter 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 6 

 BODY:
Productivity grew at a revised 2.2 percent during the fourth quarter, closing out the best year for worker efficiency in almost two decades, the government said today.
 The figure was less than the 2.4 percent pace previously estimated for the final three months of last year, the Labor Department said. Still, productivity -- the measure of how much an employee produces for every hour worked -- was stronger than the 2 percent pace expected by analysts. 
 "If companies adjust production faster because of technology, then productivity will hold up better during this growth slowdown," said Ken Mayland, president of ClearView Economics in Pepper Pike, Ohio.
For all of last year, productivity rose 4.3 percent, the most since a 4.5 percent jump in 1983 and evidence that investment in computers and management systems is helping employees stay efficient even as the economy cools.
The use of software and information technology and computers has helped double productivity gains in the last five years. That has made businesses less likely to raise prices to offset any increase in labor costs and has given Federal Reserve policy makers leeway to reduce interest rates.
Since the beginning of 1996, productivity has increased at an annual rate of about 3 percent compared with about 1.5 percent during the previous two decades. Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has expressed optimism that the accelerated pace of productivity growth will continue.
A separate report from the Commerce Department today showed factory orders fell 3.8 percent in January as bookings declined for aircraft. Excluding aircraft and other transportation equipment, orders to factories fell 0.3 percent.
Slower growth has meant a surge in unit labor costs. The measure of wages and other expenses tied to productivity rose at a 4.3 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, compared with a 3.2 percent pace in the previous three months. The increase was the biggest since a 5.5 percent rise in the fourth quarter of 1997. For all of last year, unit labor costs rose 0.7 percent, the smallest increase since 1996, when they grew at a 0.5 percent rate. Labor costs rose 1.8 percent in 1999.
Companies are cutting employee hours to limit the damage the slowing economy is having on their bottom lines. Hours worked fell at a 1.4 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, previously reported as dropping at a 1.1 pace. That is the biggest decline since a 2.3 percent drop in the first quarter of 1992 and compares with a 0.7 percent rate of decline in the third quarter.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL; 
In Arizona, Signed, Sealed and Deferred

BYLINE:  By MURRAY CHASS 

DATELINE: TUCSON, March 4 

 BODY:
The feel-good story in the Arizona Diamondbacks' camp is the willingness of 10 veteran players to change their contracts in midstream and defer more of their salaries. The players agreed to the request of Jerry Colangelo, the team's managing partner, to ease the Diamondbacks' growing financial burden.
 "I feel I'm helping this organization out to let Jerry have some working capital and go out and get what he needs to make this a competitive team," Randy Johnson, one of the deferring 10, said. 
 But not everything about the Diamondbacks' deferred plan feels good. Major League Baseball was initially alerted to the Diamondbacks' economic stress last year when it had to guarantee a bank loan for the club, a first for the sport. Now, a baseball official said, Commissioner Bud Selig sees growing concerns as the team struggles to maintain its expensive lifestyle. 
"There are significant concerns there," the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. "They've spent themselves into serious economic problems. What they've done with deferring more money has only postponed the problem."
The Diamondbacks' spending strategy -- they signed four free agents after their first season, committing a total of $118 million -- paid an instant dividend. They won a division championship in their second season, making them the most successful startup baseball team ever.
But they slipped to third place last season, matching a steady decline in season attendance, from 3.6 million to 3 million to 2.9 million, and in season-ticket sales, from 36,000 to 27,000 to 22,000.
Colangelo does not see these financial developments as ominous.
"Not at all," he said. "People refinance their homes. Companies downsize and let people go. In our case, when the season ended last year and we took inventory, I had to weigh the fact that I had committed to make a run with a group of players I put together.
"To keep it together, looking at our cash-flow projection, we needed to get a little more lean in our operations. We were a little fat. Part of what I thought was a viable option was spreading the payouts to the players. It lessens the cash-flow requirements each year."
The Diamondbacks' payroll for the coming season is expected to exceed $80 million, but the team will actually spend nearly $30 million less this year because of all of the deferrals.
The contracts of the 10 players who agreed to additional deferrals originally called for $81.7 million, or 45 percent, to be deferred out of $183.3 million in salaries for the remaining years of the deals.
The additional deferments, Colangelo said, will save the team $18 million in cash payments this year, about $16 million next year and $12 million the following year. The players' deferred money will be paid at 6.5 percent interest.
Players with four-year contracts, Colangelo said, using an example that pertains to four of the 10 players, already had eight-year payouts and now will have two years added.
But will those delayed payments create problems later?
"Not really," Colangelo said, "if that's what you're looking at as part of your overhead. Quite honestly, you have franchises in baseball that have difficulty going year to year. I'm just trying to handle my fiduciary responsibilities with some effectiveness. The balancing act is trying to stay competitive and deal with this package that's not going to go away."
Colangelo has constructed the Diamondbacks to win now. His players are expensive and they are moving along in age. The eight starting players range in age from 31 to 36 and four of the five starting pitchers are between 34 and 37 years old.
Asked if these was a sense that the Diamondbacks had to win this year, before they grow even older, Jay Bell, at 36 the oldest everyday player, said, "Certainly this year or next year."
Bell is one of the 10 players who agreed to defer more money, joining Johnson, Curt Schilling, Todd Stottlemyre, Brian Anderson, Armando Reynoso, Matt Williams, Steve Finley, Luis Gonzalez and Tony Womack. They make up the entire pitching rotation and five-eighths of the starting lineup.
"For me it was real easy," Stottlemyre said of the decision to defer more of his salary. "We're all in this together. We want to win as bad as Jerry does. Jerry wants to win as bad as we do. Maybe we're sacrificing a little bit, but the key ingredient is we all want the same thing. We all want the club to be financially stable and we all want to win. I don't think it's asking a whole lot from a guy who's getting paid millions of dollars to play a baseball game."
Colangelo said he not only encountered no resistance in carrying out his offseason plan, but he even found it to be a positive development.
"I think it has the potential to really bring a group together because everyone's in a trench together," he said. "To the best of my knowledge it's never happened before. I think a lot had to do with relationships you build with players."
That is precisely what the Diamondbacks' creator has done. 
"He was very, very fair with us in a lot of ways," said Bell, the team's first expensive free agent. "Our feeling was whenever it came time for him to do something for us, he did it. He asked us to do something for him, and we did it for him."
Colangelo said that the problems stemmed from the high cost of getting into baseball and operating the team. He estimated that cost at about $350 million, including a $130 million franchise fee and the team's share of the construction of its ballpark, about $115 million. 
The players, who said they were not concerned that they would get their deferred money, said they did not know if the team had serious financial problems.
"I don't sit in with Jerry at the board meetings to know that they have problems," Johnson said.

HEADLINE: Familiar Cast but Less Talk of Florida Voting Reform as Jeb Bush Unveils Plan 

BYLINE:  By DANA CANEDY

DATELINE: TALLAHASSEE, Fla., March 6 

 BODY:
In his first address to Florida lawmakers since the presidential election thrust the state into the international spotlight, Gov. Jeb Bush outlined his vision for tax relief, investment in education and improving nursing home care, but only briefly touched on the 36-day drama that put his brother in the White House.
 Mr. Bush's State of the State address opened this year's regular session of the Florida Legislature and was delivered before an audience that included many of those whose names and faces became familiar fixtures on television sets nationwide during the election. 
 There was Katherine Harris, the now-famous secretary of state, whose rulings on absentee ballots and late election returns made her the subject of numerous lawsuits and equal doses of criticism and praise. There were John McKay, the Florida Senate president, and Tom Feeney, the speaker of the Florida House, who in December convened a special session of the Legislature to appoint a slate of Bush electors. 
And there were the Florida Supreme Court justices, whose decision to order a manual recount of ballots in contested counties across the state was effectively reversed by the United States Supreme Court, ending former Vice President Al Gore's challenge of the election results.
Florida is facing a tight budget year, but Mr. Bush, nonetheless, outlined a wish list of priorities that called for spending more money for teacher recruitment and retention and improving the quality of nursing homes while also reducing the so-called intangible tax on assets like stocks and bonds.
"Improving public schools, providing quality long-term care, dealing with development, cutting taxes, these are all issues that should be at the forefront of the public agenda," Mr. Bush said.
It hardly seemed like the same State Capitol that was at the center of the election chaos just four months ago. In fact, the governor's speech, which he delivered in about 45 minutes, included only two paragraphs at the end about the election.
"And finally," Mr. Bush told the legislators, "we must make reliable and accurate the very machinery of democracy, the voting process." He urged lawmakers to "dedicate the resources that are needed to modernize our voting systems and move forward with confidence into the next election cycle."
The day before his address, Mr. Bush's study group on election reform presented him with a 78-page report of its findings and recommendations. Mr. Bush said then that replacing outdated voter equipment across the state was a top priority, though he gave no specific recommendations for doing so in his address. 
Democrats said Mr. Bush's speech was surprisingly short on references to election reform, especially given his very public pronouncement the day after the election was settled that he was appointing a bipartisan study group to recommend proposals to update the state's voting system.
"What I'm afraid of is that the governor is not making this a front-burner issue," said Senator Kendrick Meek, a Miami Democrat. "We have to deal with it in this session."
Several Democratic legislators said the Republicans seemed to be softening their oratory about the need for election reform, particularly to spending money to upgrade the system. Mr. Bush's study group has suggested that the state consider investing up to $40 million to lease optical scanning equipment for use in all of Florida's 67 counties.
Senator McKay said that he did not favor spending the money to put the equipment in every precinct but that he and fellow Republicans were still committed to improving the state's election system. "I think we need to work on voter education," Mr. McKay said. And he added: "We will do something. Whether we fix the system depends on how you define the term fix."
Debate about voting equipment, though, was overshadowed by a focus among many in legislators on Mr. Bush's proposed $43.3 billion budget, a 3 percent increase over last year's, and his proposed tax cut on intangible assets. Democrats say the state cannot afford the cut at a time when a slowing economy has resulted in a tight budget and possibly having to cut health services and many programs for single mothers, children and the poor.
But Mr. Bush defended the tax cut in his address, saying it would also help some people on fixed incomes. "I think we all can agree that taxing people on fixed incomes or taxing the capital that grows small businesses is bad public policy," he said.

 BODY:
 Blaming a steep fall in help-wanted ad revenue and other signs of an economic slowdown in Silicon Valley, The San Jose Mercury News is planning to lay off some of its 1,700 workers. 
Early retirement offers may help, but "we will be unable to achieve the level of expense reduction we are seeking to achieve without layoffs," the chairman and publisher, Jay T. Harris, said in a memo to the staff on Monday. All departments of the paper, part of Knight Ridder, will be examined as the company decides where to cut jobs, Mr. Harris said.

HEADLINE: Goldman Sachs Drops Plans For New Tower at Plaza Site 

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
The Goldman Sachs Group has canceled plans to build an $850 million trading structure on the site of a large public plaza at 55 Water Street, less than a week after presenting the project to city planners.
 Although the Lower Manhattan community board voted against the plan, Goldman Sachs said it decided not to proceed with the complex project strictly for business reasons. 
 The company's withdrawal puts 1.38 million square feet at 55 Water Street back on the market -- more space than in the entire Chrysler Building. It will be vacated in 2003 by J. P. Morgan Chase & Company. 
Michael G. Carey, president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation, said yesterday that he was not overly concerned about the Goldman Sachs decision. "They continue to be committed to Lower Manhattan," he said.
As for 55 Water Street, he added: "We have worried about large users being able to meet their space needs. Now we've got some space."
Other prospective tenants have already spoken up since Goldman Sachs made its decision known on Monday evening, said Edward J. Kulik Jr., the head of real estate for the Retirement Systems of Alabama, which manages the state's pension programs and owns 55 Water Street.
"There's a little bit of a setback, no question," Mr. Kulik said. "But there are a lot of opportunities."
At 3 Hanover Square, a nearby co-op apartment building that would have lost sunlight and river views to the trading structure, the news came as a relief. "Obviously, as a resident of 3 Hanover Square, I am very pleased with Goldman Sachs's change of plans," said Jonathan Greenspan, president of the co-op board. "However, I must admit that I am stunned by the swiftness of the decision and Goldman's sudden nervousness about the economy."
The decision may not have been as 11th-hour as it seems. Goldman Sachs appeared before the City Planning Commission in part to ensure its support early in the process before signing a long-term lease at 55 Water Street. Goldman Sachs occupies eight other towers downtown, including its headquarters, 85 Broad Street.
Mr. Kulik said that Retirement Systems had not abandoned the idea of adding a structure along the lines proposed by Goldman Sachs.
The structure would replace one of the largest privately owned public spaces in New York, with almost an acre of space. It was created by the developers of 55 Water Street in exchange for permission to build a larger tower than zoning rules allowed. But it never proved much of a public benefit. More than 30 feet above street level, it is often deserted, particularly when the escalators are not working. (They were, however, running yesterday.)
Under the Goldman Sachs proposal, the plaza would have been replaced by a 240-foot-high building with at least seven vast trading floors. An existing 15-story office tower on the plaza would have been altered and expanded.
This new building would have been joined to a 53-story tower on the south half of the complex, which also includes part of Vietnam Veterans Plaza.
To make up for the loss of the plaza, Goldman Sachs proposed to buy unused development rights from the low-rise South Street Seaport district.
It also proposed to build a 1,300-foot stretch of East River esplanade, to landscape a spartan public plaza along Water Street and to contribute to the reconstruction of Vietnam Veterans Plaza, which is under way.
"We were confident that given the conversations we were having with the community, we would be able to develop the site in a way that benefited all the parties," said Kathleen Baum, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs.
The chairwoman of the local community board, Madelyn Wils, said she had looked forward to negotiating better neighborhood amenities with Goldman Sachs. "We're left with a plaza which is unusable," she said, "and a lack of open space."

HEADLINE: Broadcom Reduces Earnings Forecast 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: IRVINE, Calif., March 6 

 BODY:
The Broadcom Corporation, the No. 1 maker of chips for cable modems, said today that first-quarter profit would be about two-thirds less than analysts' estimates because of a slowing United States economy and a canceled contract.
 Earnings are expected to be 8 cents to 9 cents a share on revenue of $315 million to $325 million, the company said. 
It was expected to earn 25 cents on revenue of $398 million, according to a First Call/Thomson Financial poll of analysts. 
 The company, which is based in Irvine, is the latest maker of telecommunications chips to scale back earnings expectations, blaming the slowing economy. Broadcom said that more customers delayed orders last month and that one of its biggest customers, the 3Com Corporation, canceled a contract. 3Com officials could not be reached to comment.
Broadcom is also one of the biggest makers of chips for digital cable set-top boxes and computer-networking equipment.
Its shares rose 75 cents, to $47.88. They have fallen 80 percent over the last year. The news was released after the close of regular trading.

HEADLINE: Talking to the North Koreans 

BYLINE:  By Wendy R. Sherman; Wendy R. Sherman was special adviser to the president and the secretary of state on North Korea policy in the Clinton administration.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President George Bush campaigned on a promise to defend America against missile threats from countries like North Korea. His intention is to build a national missile defense system. But such a system is not only unproven; it would undoubtedly be costly in both dollars and in diplomacy.
 Although there is some logic in trying to construct a missile defense system, there is also logic in seizing every opportunity to reduce or eliminate the missile threats through the less costly means of arms control negotiations. In dealing with North Korea, President Bush has an opportunity to take this latter approach. The question now is whether he will seize it. We may know the answer after President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea meets with President Bush today. 
 Reconciliation and engagement with North Korea have been the centerpiece of President Kim's three years in office. Although some believe that continued international isolation would bring a welcome demise of the dictatorial North Korean regime, its sudden collapse would pose terrible security and economic challenges that South Korea and the world can ill afford. Any international crisis with North Korea, particularly one involving the United States, would be likely to halt efforts, heightened by last year's summit between North and South Korea, to bring the North out of its isolation. Undoubtedly, such a crisis would also doom for the foreseeable future prospects for a final peace agreement between the North and the South.
Because Mr. Kim knows that North Korea's long-range missile threat is uppermost among America's concerns, he will most likely want to know if President Bush will close the deal with North Korea that came tantalizingly close for President Bill Clinton in his final days in office. That agreement, when completed, would both halt North Korea's exports of missiles and related technology and stop further production, deployment and testing of long-range missiles.
The clock ran out on the Clinton administration before it could nail down the final details. For two years, the administration had pursued a practical, step-by-step policy that achieved a moratorium on missile testing by Pyongyang, gained access to an underground area suspected of being a nuclear reactor site and saw the first visit of a high-ranking North Korean military official, Vice Marshal Cho Myong Rok, to the United States.
After a series of negotiations that led to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's visit to Pyongyang in October 2000, North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il, appears ready to make landmark commitments about the missile program. To ensure the survival of his regime, he has to improve the country's disastrous economy by reducing the burden of a vast missile program and opening the doors to trade.
There are many challenges in ending this lingering Cold War conflict, and many would assume that Kim Dae Jung would first want to get North Korea to move back its million-man army from deployment along the North-South border. But he knows that he can counter that with conventional forces. So his priority is to reduce the destabilizing force of weapons of mass destruction, particularly long-range nuclear missiles. The world saw the threat they pose in 1998, when a missile being tested by North Korea flew over Japan and set off an international crisis that could have undone the 1994 nuclear agreement with the United States that halted the North's fissile material production.
President Bush, for his part, does not need to make a false choice between negotiating a missile agreement with North Korea and pursuing his already stated intention to build a national missile defense. It will take time to achieve a missile agreement and test North Korea's compliance with it. It will also take considerable time to develop and test virtually any national missile defense system. So Mr. Bush can move forward on both strategies without foreclosing any options. If negotiations do achieve a real reduction or elimination of the North Korean missile threat, Mr. Bush can then decide if he should change his approach to national missile defense.
Although President Bush has time to consider his approach to negotiations, North Korea, a country of immense pride, will not wait forever. Kim Jong Il is capable of creating a crisis absent a clear signal that negotiations are possible. He is certain to be listening closely to the tone and substance of reports from this week's meeting between Mr. Bush and Kim Dae Jung. President Bush should restart talks with North Korea, and if an agreement is at hand, be ready to meet with Kim Jong Il. 
Some are understandably concerned that a summit with President Bush would only legitimize the North Korean leader. But, if such a meeting verifiably eliminated a major missile threat to the United States and the world, drew North Korea into the international community and began to open a window of freedom for that country's starved and desperate citizens, it would be more than worth the risk.

HEADLINE: A Talkative Putin Demonstrates Value of Cyberspace 

BYLINE:  By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, March 6 

 BODY:
Last year President Vladimir V. Putin flew in a jet fighter to Chechnya and sailed in a nuclear submarine in an Arctic sea. Tonight he entered cyberspace for the first time.
 Greeting a mostly young audience from around the world in a 40-minute live encounter on the Internet that was broadcast by the BBC, Mr. Putin defended Russia's policies in Chechnya, praised the achievements of the Soviet education system, and insisted that he was taking the country in the right direction toward greater democracy. 
 The 48-year-old Russian leader took the opportunity of the worldwide forum to again warn the Bush administration that if Washington withdraws from a 1972 treaty banning national missile defenses, "the whole of today's international security structure will collapse." 
The discussion on the Internet did not break much new ground in conveying Mr. Putin's well-known views. He has already established himself as the most talkative president in the country's modern history, but the Internet session was significant as an attempt by the Kremlin to go over the heads of Russian and Western media in carrying Mr. Putin's message directly to a worldwide audience. 
A BBC moderator said at one point that more than 15,000 questions were received in the run up to the Web cast from Russian Internet users, and also from users as far away as Australia, England, Switzerland, Denmark and the United States. 
A Kremlin spokesman said tonight that the event had been two months in the making with a special studio set up in the Kremlin. "We also had to make sure that the site was well enough protected against hackers," who have broken into Kremlin Web sites in the past, the spokesman said. 
The Internet format was apparently an idea hatched by Mr. Putin's staff.
"We wanted to show that we understand that the Internet is an important part of forming public opinion," the spokesman said. "This is well known in the West, but not yet so widespread here."
In the online session, Mr. Putin said he gets up early every morning and swims for 20 minutes before heading to his Kremlin office and then takes another 90-minute break for exercise later in the day before resuming work until 10 p.m. or midnight. He said he is currently reading a book about the rule of Catherine the Great and another about the history of Russian literature and culture.
Asked to name a favorite Western cinema actor, Mr. Putin pondered and came up with Romy Schneider, who starred with Rod Steiger in "Innocents with Dirty Hands" in 1975. 
Mr. Putin confessed that he did not use the Internet because he has been too lazy to learn, though he said his two daughters use it extensively, so much so that their mother is trying to cut back on the time they spend on the computer. Mr. Putin said he received most of his information from a large staff of aides "who provide me with a kind of ready product" of daily information.
In one bit of news, Mr. Putin said that in "the very near future" he would present to Russia's Parliament a "whole package of proposals" to reform Russia's judicial system, one of the most long-awaited reforms of his year-old presidency.
Many young Russians wanted to know what Mr. Putin was going to do about the deteriorating education system in Russia. 
"I think that some elements of our past life, our Soviet life, do deserve to be remembered with kind words," he responded. "Education, medicine and science -- they were all things the former Soviet Union could be proud of, and rightly so." 
But he offered no prescription on how to rescue ailing education institutions beyond saying, "I am going to try to preserve what was best in the previous education system."
Many questions were about democracy and freedom of the press, one of them from a Texan identified as Jonathan Jones. Mr. Putin said he realized that there were "those living abroad" who "worry about how the state will develop." 
"I can say that for as long as I remain head of state, we will adhere precisely to democratic principles of development," he said, adding, "I am sure that this country simply has no alternative but democratic development and market economy."
In an apparent reference to the fight between private and state interests for control of Russia's only independent television channel, NTV, Mr. Putin asserted that "a group of people" had taken over parts of the mass media "not quite legally." 
Then he added: "Anarchy and permissiveness should not flourish in Russia. Some people simply do not like it when we are trying to put things in order, to make everyone live according to the law." He finished making his point simply by saying that fears of government suppression of criticism are "groundless." 
Mr. Putin acknowledged that many people in the world have a "poor opinion" of Russia's actions in suppressing rebellion in Chechnya, where tens of thousands have died and hundreds of thousands of civilians have been left homeless by two brutal wars.
The Russian leader countered that many people also have a "good opinion" of Russia's military operations. "I can tell you why," he said. "It is because the Chechens themselves received nothing from their self-appointed rulers apart from robbery and fraud."
"And we think that the actions of the Russian army are aimed at the liberation of the Chechen people from the terrorists who have seized power there," he added. 
Mr. Putin acknowledged that the promise of reform had yet to be fulfilled for most of the Russian people. 
"We have been marking time," he said, referring to the 1990's when "there was no consensus either in society or the Parliament itself" and therefore "it was impossible to adopt any decisions." He pointed out that in his first year in office he had succeeded in winning approval from Parliament for a 13 percent flat income tax as well as for customs reforms to promote growth in trade.
But he agreed with a critic from Kazan that reforms could have made "better and faster progress." He added, "But it probably ought to be acknowledged that although we are not happy with the pace and perhaps even the quality, we are still moving ahead."
Mr. Putin also said he is determined to build a more effective Russian military force, but he did not reveal further details about the large troop cuts that were announced last fall. 
"We should strive for our army to be highly professional, well trained, provided with modern equipment and -- beyond all doubt -- for it to remain outside politics so that the army -- and the other power structures of the country -- should be under the control of society."

HEADLINE: Management: Seasoning Compensation Stew; 
Varying the Recipe Helps TV Operation Solve Morale Problem

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN D. GLATER 

DATELINE: BETHESDA, Md. 

 BODY:
A few years ago, Mark Kozaki and other executives at Discovery Communications Inc. had a morale problem on their hands.
 Some of the company's top achievers were earning the same salaries as slackers in the same position. In other cases, employees doing the same work as colleagues in other parts of the company, which is based in Bethesda, were being paid less. 
 The only way for managers to reward the workplace stars was to give them a bonus or promote them to another position; Discovery's compensation structure did not allow for big raises for people who remained in the same job.
"People felt that it was unfair," said Mr. Kozaki, who is senior vice president for administration and operations in the United States for Discovery, which owns the Discovery Channel, Animal Planet and 31 other cable networks. 
The company found that its compensation structure was not just unfair, it was often counterproductive. Some people accepted promotions to jobs they were not equipped for, while others tried to switch to more generous departments in the company.
And so, in early 1998, Discovery began an overhaul of its compensation policy, switching to a pay-for-performance system that allowed for both big raises and bonuses.
Even though the traditional justification for maintaining a relatively fixed pay structure is to promote a sense of equity among employees, by abandoning it, Mr. Kozaki said, dissension in the ranks soon dissipated.
"It has eliminated many of the concerns about whether there is across-the-board fairness," he said. "There is not as much discussion or wondering or suspicion" as before.
Experts in employee compensation say more companies are shifting away from fixed pay structures that have long been the norm to more flexible performance-driven arrangements like Discovery's.
Though the old practice of keeping pay within narrow boundaries for workers in the same job classification still prevails, an increasing number of managers are realizing that they have to come to grips with the challenge of rewarding their best workers without raising labor costs significantly.
The solution for many companies is to hold automatic pay raises to a minimum, thus punishing mediocre employees, while lavishing merit raises and bonuses on the superstars.
The bonuses are increasingly based on measurements of both the individual's attainments and the company's overall profits and other results.
More than half of the 2,400 companies surveyed in 2000 by William M. Mercer Inc., a human resources consulting firm in New York, reported that they had performance-based incentive programs in place for both management and nonmanagement employees. And 49 percent said that they had increased the number of employees eligible for such programs since 1997.
"It's due to two issues," said Steven E. Gross, who runs the compensation consulting practice at Mercer. "Attraction and retention of good people, and companies trying not to raise their fixed costs."
And by linking bonuses to corporate results as well as individual attainments, he said, companies can share the wealth in good times, but can cut bonuses before jobs in bad times. "It self-corrects some of your costs," he said.
Mr. Gross said some studies suggested that every $1 invested in an employee incentive program could lead to a $2 increase in revenue, but he cautioned that so many variables had to be considered in making that calculation that conclusions were extremely tentative.
Managers, of course, have always been rewarded for doing well, but the expansion of financial incentives into the middle and lower ranks of the organization is a relatively recent phenomenon that has accelerated over the last decade, compensation experts say.
Late in 2000, as just one illustration, the New York law firm of Stroock & Stroock & Lavan announced that it would begin paying bonuses to junior lawyers based on their individual performance, a bounty once reserved for partners only.
At Discovery, which grew so quickly that the compensation structure long went unexamined, Mr. Kozaki said that attrition rates had fallen and complaints from employees were less frequent since the new policy went into effect. "Employees think they are being treated fairly," he said.
Under the old system, an information-technology specialist who was doing good work could not have received a raise when competitors' wages rose for comparable employees unless she was also promoted, said Anthony R. Amato, Discovery's vice president for compensation, benefits and human resources.
Under the new system, the specialist could receive a raise -- rewarding good performance and also matching competitors -- without being burdened with new management responsibilities that she was not ready for, he said.
"Historically, we weren't separating performance" of the individual employee, that employee's job and the wages paid by competitors from evaluation of that employee's readiness for more responsibility, Mr. Amato said. That meant that employees might be promoted too quickly if they did well or if it was necessary to give them a raise to keep them from defecting.
Now, Discovery provides two types of incentives to workers. First, all employees are eligible for a merit increase in salary. A computer program considers an employee's current base salary and an evaluation by that employee's manager, then recommends a minimum and maximum raise.
Second, every employee is eligible for a year-end bonus, which is a percentage of the employee's base pay. Again, the bonus is based in part on a manager's evaluation, but it incorporates the company's performance, too. 
Sherner Sumter is an executive assistant who has worked at Discovery for a year and a half. Under the new pay structure, she is eligible for both a raise based on her manager's evaluation of her job performance and for a bonus of up to 10 percent of her salary. Her boss's evaluation of how well she does her job and how eagerly she shows initiative and takes on new responsibilities accounts for 80 percent of the potential bonus, while 10 percent is based on how her division does, and a final 10 percent is based on how the company as a whole does.
"It helps you to be motivated," Ms. Sumter said. The lure of higher pay has prompted her to take on "a lot of different projects" that she might otherwise not seek out, she said, like developing a system that allowed her department to respond more quickly and efficiently to requests from different networks. It has also inspired her to speak up more on ways her department could streamline some of its operations.
"I might go in and say, 'What can we do to improve the way we manage the data?' " she said.
The technology that Discovery has developed to link individual bonuses to divisionwide and corporatewide performance sets the company apart, said Russell H. Miller, a partner at S.C.A. Consulting, a compensation adviser that helped Discovery come up with the structure -- though not the computer system -- for its compensation.
"They're on the leading edge of integrating those systems fully," he said, adding that S.C.A. did not have the technical skill to develop Discovery's system. "They are more sophisticated than I typically come across."
Discovery used Lotus Notes to develop a database that could take into consideration managers' evaluations of employees, overall corporate performance and employees' responsibilities to recommend a minimum and maximum bonus for individual employees.
Before the adoption of the new program, employees received an annual cost-of-living adjustment to their wages, usually a little above the rate of inflation for that year, said the company's president and chief operating officer, Judith A. McHale.
Although employees could receive bonuses, the only way to receive a raise was to be promoted.
Such promotions are not necessarily a good thing, Ms. McHale said, because doing one thing well does not necessarily mean that an employee is ready to be promoted to manage several people doing the same thing.
"We needed to be able to, within a job category, acknowledge that there are different levels of performance," she said.
The hard part of overhauling compensation is deciding how loud a message to send, Mr. Miller said. Overrewarding star performers could backfire by causing jealousy among co-workers and eroding their productivity, he said. And it is probably still too early to know whether Discovery's new incentive structure, which is still in its infancy, will have an adverse effect.
"The key is to make sure that you have a system or process that gives you the highest likelihood of success of accurate differentiation," Mr. Miller said. "The less arbitrary it is and the more objective it is, the better."
Some resentment is probably inevitable, though, in any system that ranks some people as more valuable than others, he said. Whether such a system is fair, he added, "is a philosophical decision."

HEADLINE: Korean to Visit Bush, but They Could Be at Odds 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 6 

 BODY:
South Korea's president, Kim Dae Jung, arrived here tonight for what could prove to be a clash with the Bush administration over the right strategy for dealing with North Korea as it emerges from self-imposed isolation for the first time in nearly 50 years.
 Mr. Kim, who won the Nobel Peace Prize last year for his efforts to end the armed standoff that has existed with the North since the end of the Korean War, has told his aides and some visiting Americans that he intends to sign a peace "declaration" with his North Korean counterpart, Kim Jong Il, in the next few months. While that declaration would fall short of a peace treaty, Mr. Kim believes that it is essential to making irreversible the North's tentative moves to engage the outside world. 
 But it comes just as the Bush administration is undertaking what it calls a "thorough review" of American policy toward North Korea, with a clear view toward taking a far harder line than the Clinton administration did when it negotiated a major nuclear deal in 1994, and tried, unsuccessfully, to close a deal on missile controls last year. 
Senior administration officials indicate that they continue to view North Korea as a major threat, and they are clearly wary that Mr. Kim's peace initiatives have moved too fast, with too few concessions from the North. One senior American official told reporters today that "the North Korean regime is a problem and Kim Jong Il is a problem."
American military and intelligence officials, fearful that the North is stringing out negotiations while it hardens its military emplacements along the demilitarized zone, recently warned the Bush administration that the North had begun laying fiber-optic cables just north of the DMZ so that it could stymie American intelligence gathering and bolster its ability to unleash a devastating conventional attack on Seoul and the 37,000 American troops still on the Korean Peninsula.
This conflict in views between the new occupants of the White House and a Nobel Prize winner who "is in a big hurry," in the words of one of his occasional advisers, poses a major challenge for Mr. Bush. Until now his encounters with foreign leaders have been largely friendly get-togethers with the leaders of Mexico, Canada and Britain. On Wednesday he will meet an American ally who views the world very differently, and believes that Washington could get in the way of a strategy that is working. 
"Bush is like a cop and Kim Dae Jung is like a priest," said Douglas Paal, who heads the Asia Pacific Policy Center here and is allied with many critics of Kim Dae Jung in the Bush administration. "The cop wants to get the North Koreans disarmed and off the streets and the priest wants to give him the resources to become a very different person."
The two leaders will doubtless appear to straddle the difference on Wednesday, and the White House has made sure that they are not subjected to more than brief questioning. 
Mr. Bush's aides say the president will mostly be listening on Wednesday, assuring Mr. Kim that the alliance between Seoul and Washington is strong and that he will review North Korea issues in the next few months. Already Secretary of State Colin L. Powell has expressed some interest in picking up the missile negotiations that never came to fruition last year, saying today that he saw "promising elements" in those talks and offering to "pick up where President Clinton and his administration left off."
But the South Koreans know that other aides rank among their greatest critics. 
Among them is Paul D. Wolfowitz, nominated as Deputy Secretary of Defense, who told Congress two years ago that the 1994 deal that froze North Korea's one known nuclear weapons production facility was deeply flawed. "The real issue is how much are they producing elsewhere, covertly, and possibly underground," he said. He has also offered blistering critiques of Mr. Clinton and Mr. Kim's strategy of paying the North -- with food, oil or a commitment to build nuclear power plants in North Korea -- to give up its weapons programs.
Today the senior American official said the administration would not walk away from the 1994 deal, saying "it was a commitment involving several governments," including Japan. Privately, however, many Bush administration officials say they want to explore a way to stop delivery of two conventional nuclear power plants to the North -- the quid pro quo for halting its operations to reprocess nuclear waste -- and to replace them with conventional coal-fired plants. The nuclear facilities, they worry, could ultimately provide the North with the raw material to make small nuclear weapons. 
President Kim's view is that any effort to reopen the 1994 accord would be disastrous, and could kill the nascent peace talks between North and South. He has quietly told visiting American officials and the administration that he is ready to sign a peace "declaration" with Kim Jong Il even if the North does not back it up by pulling its army back from the DMZ, or make progress on the missile deal with Washington. 
That has left White House officials clearly wary. "We will ask President Kim to consult us before he goes forward with anything like that," one official said today. 
But President Kim is not likely to be deterred. He is coming under increasing criticism at home for his handling of the South Korean economy, and opposition leaders contend that he has been seduced by the North. Meanwhile, he is racing to build rail links and trade ties that could ultimately bring North and South Korea into a commercial, if not a political, confederation. 
"This is his legacy, and he believes he does not have much time to make sure the North Koreans don't reverse course," said one South Korean who has talked about the plans with President Kim. "And he's ready to go his own way if he has to."
But Mr. Kim needs Washington's cooperation. Few doubt that North Korea's real aim is to normalize relations with the United States, in hopes of opening the spigot of aid from the World Bank and others who could provide the starving country with a chance to rebuild a country shattered by war and mismanagement.
At the Wednesday meeting, Mr. Kim will also have to step lightly around another conflict with Washington, over national and regional missile defense systems.
Last week Mr. Kim angered the Bush administration when he stood alongside President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and strongly suggested that he shared Russia's distaste for Mr. Bush's plans for a missile shield -- and said the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty was "a cornerstone of strategic stability" around the world.
"We certainly don't consider it the cornerstone," said the senior administration official, whose protests to South Korea led to a half-hearted retraction of the statement as soon as Mr. Putin had left Seoul. 
President Kim's aides say they fear that the Bush administration, in its enthusiasm to promote the missile shield, is not too eager to have North Korea defanged as the prime example of a "rogue state" capable of hitting the United States.

HEADLINE: Making an Offer That's Hard to Refuse; 
Phillips Will Auction 2 Renoirs Linked to a Sotheby's Board Member

BYLINE:  By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
Until recently, two Renoir portraits from the 1870's hung in the Park Avenue apartment of the financier and collector Henry R. Kravis, who is a board member, not incidentally, of Sotheby's auction house.
 Mr. Kravis has decided to sell the Renoirs, valued together at $18 million to $24 million, but the paintings are not being offered through Sotheby's. Instead they are being sold through the house's newest competitor, Phillips. 
 The deal is the most vivid evidence so far of Phillips's drive to become a major player in the auction world and to break up the decades-old duopoly of Sotheby's and Christie's, both shaken by a continuing federal antitrust investigation. Mr. Kravis did not return calls about the decision to bypass Sotheby's. 
But in the art world the assumption is that Phillips is again doing what it has done ever since LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton bought the company nearly two years ago: guaranteeing collectors so much money that neither Sotheby's nor Christie's can come near the offers.
As a consequence, the high-end auction world -- a cozy gentleman's club until the federal investigation into price-fixing and collusion shattered its decorum -- is becoming an ever more free-wheeling, up-for-grabs marketplace, which makes officials at both houses worry that tight profit margins could evaporate completely.
"They've taken a couple of hundred million out of the market that would have belonged to us," Edward Dolman, Christie's chief executive, said of Phillip's.
Neither he nor anyone at Phillips expects the insurgent to rival the size of the two big houses. "They haven't got the infrastructure in place to do what we do," Mr. Dolman said. But with Sotheby's and Christie's competing vigorously since the revelations about collusion, Phillips is giving rich buyers another place to look.
Last month Phillips announced it was selling a prized group of paintings and drawings by Cezanne and van Gogh belonging to Heinz Berggruen, the Berlin-based dealer. The star of the collection is Cezanne's "Montagne Ste. Victoire," which experts say could sell for as much as $80 million. (Phillips has conservatively estimated it at $35 million to $45 million.)
Phillips's new chairman, Simon de Pury, says he was able to line up Mr. Berggruen's collection because they have long been friends. It also did not hurt that Olivier Berggruen, one of Mr. Berggruen's sons, works for Mr. de Pury. Like Sotheby's and Christie's, Phillips also plans a tour to highlight its May 7 Impressionist and modern art sale in New York. Selections from the Berggruen property and Mr. Kravis's two Renoirs are to be shown in Geneva beginning next Wednesday, then go to Paris and San Francisco, where they will be shown at the John Berggruen Gallery, owned by another of Mr. Berggruen's sons.
The Kravis transaction, unusual because board members tend to sell through the houses they help direct, comes at a bad time for Sotheby's and Christie's. In the Justice Department investigation, Christie's, a privately held company, has received conditional amnesty for turning over documents that charted the collusion with Sotheby's to fix commissions. Sotheby's, whose stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange, has fared worse. 
The two companies are splitting the cost of a $512 million settlement of a class action suit by auction house customers, but Sotheby's has also pleaded guilty to violating antitrust laws and has paid a $45 million fine, settled a class action suit filed by shareholders for $40 million in stock, and forced the resignation of its board chairman and chief executive officer, Diana D. Brooks. She also pleaded guilty to violating antitrust laws and agreed to help prosecutors in their continuing investigation of the former board chairman, A. Alfred Taubman, who remains Sotheby's controlling shareholder. Mr. Taubman hired Credit Suisse First Boston in January to help him sell the company.
Phillips is certainly looking to make the most of Christie's and Sotheby's problems. Ever since LVMH bought the foundering third-place auction house in 1999, it has been pouring millions of dollars into the company to challenge the two giants. 
"Phillips is hungrier for material than Sotheby's and Christie's," said Vance Jordan, a Manhattan dealer. "They have been willing to take pictures that the other two won't. The only danger is that to get the artworks, prices are being inflated in a way that could damage the market."
On Jan. 1, the chairman of LVMH, Bernard Arnault, merged Phillips with de Pury & Luxembourg, the Geneva-based company of private dealers. It was run by Mr. de Pury, who was a former chairman of Sotheby's Europe, and Daniella Luxembourg, a former deputy chairman of Sotheby's Switzerland who is now Phillips's president. They came armed with connections to some of the richest American collectors.
"This is a highly personal business, and individual relationships between collectors are based on years of working with them," said Mr. de Pury, whose trilingual auctioneering has made him a favorite charity auctioneer on the global society circuit. "The art market is a personal market, not an industry."
Still, those in the art world say that it is Phillips's business practices that have shaken up the auction scene. Experts at Sotheby's and Christie's say the guarantees Phillips offers are so generous they just can't compete. But Mr. de Pury and Ms. Luxembourg deny such allegations.
Although Sotheby's and Christie's are both cutting their staffs, they are having to give large financial incentives to their top employees, who are getting offers to join Phillips.
There is nothing to prevent Mr. Kravis from selling his paintings wherever he wants. William Ruprecht, Sotheby's chief executive officer, issued a statement on the Kravis sale yesterday saying: "Henry Kravis has been an extraordinarily valuable and supportive board member of Sotheby's, particularly over the last challenging year. Whatever unique economic opportunity he may have with Phillips in no way affects his relationship, and we look forward to his continued involvement as a board member of Sotheby's."
Mr. de Pury declined to discuss the financial arrangement for the two Renoirs, although officials at Phillips did say the property was guaranteed. In an interview, he would not confirm that Mr. Kravis was the seller of the Renoirs, but art world experts say that an adviser whom Mr. Kravis consults on his art transactions has talked about his intentions with Sotheby's and Christie's. Those who know Mr. Kravis and his wife, Marie-Josee, say that Mrs. Kravis prefers modern and contemporary art to the candy-box Impressionist images of Renoir.
But that does not explain why he is selling the paintings at Phillips. Experts at Sotheby's say Mr. Kravis did not even give them a chance to compete. Mr. Kravis has been one of Sotheby's more active board members and was primarily responsible for the appointment of Michael I. Sovern as the company's chairman, replacing Mr. Taubman.
Mr. de Pury said that competition aside, he did not want to turn Phillips into another Sotheby's or Christie's. He said he intended to keep Phillips small and run it as a boutique concern specializing only in top-end paintings, jewelry and furniture. "We want to stay lean," he said. "This way we don't have the multiplicity of costs."
At the other firms, concern about Phillips is mixed with skepticism. Their worldwide offices generate business and provide client services that a small operation cannot, they say. "Our people have relationships with clients going back decades," Mr. Dolman said.
What bothers the two big houses most, they say, is that Phillips threatens a business of tight margins, forcing them to make larger guaranteed estimates than they would like.
One Sotheby's official said that the value of what is being sold had not kept pace with rising costs and that a economic downturn would sorely test LVMH's finances. Mr. Dolman said he was dubious about Phillips's long-term prospects. "Their strategy is obvious," he said. "The question is just how long Mr. Arnault wants to pay the price."

Bashing the Boomers

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
Call it a "Bush trillion." It's a sum that is either much more or much less than $1 trillion -- whichever is convenient -- but one that George W. Bush thinks he can get away with calling "a trillion dollars" in speeches.
 During the campaign Mr. Bush, to emphasize his moderation, claimed that he was matching a trillion dollars in tax cuts with a trillion dollars of new spending. In fact he proposed less than half a trillion in new programs, and now he proposes no real increase in spending at all. The tax cut, on the other hand, turns out to be $1.6 trillion, except that it's really $2 trillion once you count the interest costs. And it will be $2.5 trillion if it is accelerated, something Mr. Bush has urged but not factored into his numbers, and if a major wrinkle involving the alternative minimum tax is ironed out. 
 Meanwhile Mr. Bush has come up with another trillion, this time his "trillion-dollar contingency fund." It comes as no surprise that the actual number in his budget is only a bit more than $800 billion. And more than half of that consists of funds that Medicare was supposed to be setting aside for the needs of an aging population. So maybe we also need to define a "Bush contingency," as in: "Gee, people might get older, and they might have medical expenses. We can't be sure -- but it could happen."
Which brings us to the question of identifying the victims. 
For there will be victims. The latest line from tax-cut supporters is that this isn't really a big cut, that we can easily afford it. But if that were true, Mr. Bush would be able to justify his plans with honest accounting, and would be able to honor his own party's promises to protect the retirement trust funds. Yes, his cut is somewhat smaller as a share of G.D.P. than Ronald Reagan's. But Mr. Reagan's tax cut was a fiscal disaster, and would have been even worse had his irresponsibility not been partly offset by increases in the payroll tax that finances Social Security and Medicare. 
So who will be hurt? First, of course, the usual suspects: the poor and near-poor, who, because they pay no income tax (though they pay quite a lot in other taxes), will get nothing from the tax cut but will bear the brunt of the spending austerity that the tax cut will force. And these victims include a third of the nation's children.
But there will be other victims: middle-income baby boomers.
We keep hearing about the "typical" family that will receive a $1,600 tax cut. Now it's true that under Mr. Bush's plan a median-income family of two adults and two children under the age of 17 would get a $1,600 cut starting in 2006. Most of that, however, comes not from lower tax rates but from an increased child credit. A couple whose children are grown (or even college-age) get only $600, a widow or widower gets only $300. So for middle-income baby boomers, there just isn't much of a tax break. (You can also start to see why 88 percent of families will get less than that "typical" $1,600 break, in most cases much less.)
Needless to say, there is no comparable fine print when it comes to tax cuts for the rich.
Meanwhile, Mr. Bush has made it clear that he intends to raid the funds that were supposed to support the baby boomers in their retirement. Social Security and Medicare were expected to accumulate almost $3 trillion in reserves over the next decade, reserves that were supposed to be there for the baby boomers. But Mr. Bush proposes to divert about $1 trillion -- a real trillion, not a Bush trillion -- into other uses. There will be elaborate sophistry about how money diverted into individual Social Security accounts is still "in the system," about how Medicare surpluses used to finance prescription drug benefits are still part of Medicare, but the fact is that in each case the money isn't available for its intended use.
Without those reserves Medicare will be in trouble early in the next decade, Social Security a bit later. But the pressure to cut benefits will begin years before. 
In an unguarded moment during the campaign Mr. Bush remarked about the future Texas fiscal situation, "I hope I'm not here to deal with it." Maybe his attitude toward the consequences of his tax cut is the same: by the time the bill comes due, he'll be gone.

HEADLINE: Parties Jockey on Details Of Proposed Cut in Taxes 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 6 

 BODY:
Republicans and Democrats in Congress jockeyed for political advantage today in anticipation of a vote in the House on Thursday on the core of President Bush's tax plan, an across-the-board reduction in income tax rates.
 Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader, argued that Mr. Bush's proposal for a $1.6 trillion tax cut over 10 years was too modest and said that a larger cut was needed to give the economy a jolt. 
 But a group of moderate Democrats who call themselves Blue Dogs made it clear that they would vote against the bill, dashing the administration's hope that it might win bipartisan support in the House. 
Thursday's vote will be the new president's first test in Congress on a major piece of legislation.
The legislation is almost certain to pass on Thursday with solid Republican support. The focus will shift to the Senate, where some Democratic votes will be essential for approval.
The bill would lower tax rates for all income-tax payers this year by reducing to 12 percent, from 15 percent, the tax on the first $6,000 of taxable income. The rate cut would be retroactive to Jan. 1. Individuals would get a tax cut this year of $180; married couples would get $360.
Over the next several years, rates at the higher tax brackets would be lowered, and the tax savings at upper-income levels would be considerably greater.
The measure would cost $958 billion over 10 years, about three-fifths of the tax package. Later this year, the House plans to consider other aspects of the Bush plan like the repeal of the estate tax, a doubling of the tax credit for children and new tax breaks for married couples.
Democrats were cynical about Mr. Armey's call for a larger tax cut, saying it was a ploy to make Mr. Bush seem to be taking the middle ground.
But Mr. Armey, who has a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Oklahoma, declared: "As an economist, I pay attention to the economic news that is still to me troubling that this economy seems to sort of be kind of stuck at a slower tempo than it is capable of achieving. I believe it is time for us to seriously look at a tax reduction larger than the $1.6 trillion that has been proposed. I see no reason for us to be boxed in by that number."
Mr. Bush has said he does not want the tax cut to go beyond $1.6 trillion, and Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who heads the Senate Finance Committee, said today that nothing larger stood a chance in the Senate.
Mr. Bush was in Chicago today for a speech to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, one of a series of trips around the country to try to win support for the tax plan.
So far, few Democrats have come aboard. The 33 Blue Dog Democrats, who take pride in their fiscal conservatism, issued a statement today saying they could not vote for a tax cut until a budget had been adopted.
"We need to make sure there will be resources to address other priorities," they said, "particularly strengthening Social Security and Medicare, before voting on a tax cut." 
Last week, Mr. Bush was in Louisiana and Arkansas and urged people there to lean on their senators and representatives to support the tax bill. But moderate Democratic senators from those states said today that they still planned to vote against it.
Senator Blanche Lincoln, Democrat of Arkansas, said she had not been persuaded that the measure would be good for her constituents. Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, said, "There are some real questions as to whether we can pay down the debt and preserve Social Security and Medicare under these plans."
Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, said it was not a "responsible, conservative fiscal approach" to approve a tax cut before a budget had been agreed on.
Nonetheless, Senator Grassley said that Mr. Bush's arm-twisting was invaluable and that he hoped at least 10 Democratic senators would ultimately vote for the tax bill.
This afternoon, Mr. Armey had a news conference with representatives of dozens of business groups that are backing the Bush tax bill. Hoping to demonstrate that the tax reduction would help not just businesses and upper-income individuals, Mr. Armey presented a waiter from Northern Virginia and the owners of two small businesses, a retail shop and a construction company.
The waiter, Scott Willis, said the tax cut would mean an additional $500 a year in his pocket.
"This is my money," Mr. Willis said, "and I'd like to have it."

Seeing Achievement Gains By an Attack on Poverty

BYLINE:  By Richard Rothstein 

 BODY:
A SENATE committee began considering President Bush's education plan yesterday. The president wants new spending of $25 billion over five years, a total of about $500 per pupil over current annual levels. Democrats want even more, $35 billion.
 This is a lot of money, much of it to raise poor children's scores. It may work. But if social disadvantage breeds low achievement, could we raise performance as effectively by alleviating poverty itself? 
 It might be easier than it appears.
School programs alone have not closed the achievement gap between poor and middle-class children, so other approaches are certainly worth a try.
The surgeon general, David Satcher, reported last May that more than a third of poor children have untreated dental cavities. Pupils taking tests with toothaches are unlikely to score as well as those undistracted by pain.
Offering school-based dental services is relatively inexpensive. Columbia University's School of Dentistry runs clinics at schools in Harlem and Washington Heights; the assistant dean, Stephen Marshall, estimates a clinic costs about $175 per pupil.
So to free poor children from taking tests while distracted by toothaches would cost less than $2 billion. We might get a bigger score bounce from such spending than from educational programs costing far more.
Alleviating lead poisoning is even less expensive. Toddlers who breathe dust or eat flakes from lead-based paint have impaired cognitive abilities. The paint was banned for interior use in 1978, but many children live in structures built earlier. Lead can permeate environments of poor families because their apartments are repainted less often, so older layers of paint are exposed.
The General Accounting Office says about 10 percent of poor children have dangerous levels of lead in their blood, likely to "cause reductions in I.Q. and attention span, reading and learning disabilities, hyperactivity and behavioral problems."
Yet fewer than one in five children in low-income families have been screened for lead. Despite federal rules, many states do not cover screening under Medicaid. By enforcing this regulation, Mr. Bush might get an academic score jump.
In St. Louis, the Grace Hill Neighborhood Health Centers recently began testing children for lead. It sends health coaches to homes of children with high lead levels. These aides help cover peeling window sills with plastic and bring vacuum cleaners with filters that are more effective than common household models.
If these services were sponsored by schools in poor communities (and extended to preschoolers and pregnant women) it would add about $75 per pupil to district budgets, according to calculations of Richard K. Gram, Grace Hill's director. The national cost of this program would be less than $1 billion. Test scores might rise as lead levels fell.
Other programs could also address social and economic causes of low achievement. Some solutions need even fewer dollars than battling toothaches or lead poisoning.
Teenage smoking, for example, rose in the 1990's so children will continue to be born to young women who smoke while pregnant. Medical researchers have related such smoking to a 4-point loss in children's I.Q.; it may also add to mental retardation cases needing special education.
Anti-smoking efforts, including counseling and making tobacco less available to youths, are known to work. Smoking by older pregnant women fell in the last decade so a special focus on teenage smoking may be more cost effective than academic programs in raising scores of the following generation .
There are also more expensive approaches to consider. Pupil transiency stemming from poor housing is an important cause of low scores. In the midst of a national urban housing crisis, keeping children in the same classrooms by stabilizing their families' housing would be costly -- but less so when we consider what is now spent in schools, often fruitlessly, to compensate for mobility.
Somehow, both Republicans and Democrats have become convinced that schools can be immune to social environments. To make poor children academically proficient, we think only to raise standards, create sanctions for failure, and perhaps provide better teachers, smaller classes or more school time.
These reforms may work. But it is curious that, when we see poor children with lower test scores, we fail to consider if improving conditions of poverty, sometimes at relatively little cost, might also have an impact.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 22, 2001

 CORRECTION:
The Lessons column on March 7 about nonacademic steps to improve achievement among low-income students referred imprecisely to efforts by health centers in St. Louis to minimize lead poisoning. The centers have been testing children for lead for years, not just recently. Their aides have recently started visiting homes of children with high lead levels to reduce contact with lead from sources like peeling window sills.

HEADLINE: Bush Takes Tax-Cut Campaign to Chicago's Trading Pits 

BYLINE:  By FRANK BRUNI

DATELINE: CHICAGO, March 6 

 BODY:
President Bush took his pitch for a $1.6 trillion tax cut to the floor of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange today, using the backdrop of frenetic trading activity and "pork bellies" signs for his claim that the measure was necessary to keep such markets robust.
 In blunt terms, Mr. Bush pressed his stated concern that the nation's economy was ailing, and said that lowering taxes was the tonic that would restore it to health. 
 "We're facing a problem," Mr. Bush said as he stood at a lectern set up in the exchange's live cattle pit, where traders buy and sell that particular commodity. "And the problem is our economy's slowing down. 
"You all know that as well as anybody does," he continued. "This kind of great boom is starting to sputter a little bit. And the question you need to be asking the president is, 'What do you intend to do about it, Mr. President?' And here it is."
That remedy, Mr. Bush said, was restraint in federal spending, debt repayment and a cut of tax rates.
There was a none-too-faint echo in Mr. Bush's appearance here of his father's footsteps. In 1991, when George Bush the elder was president, he made a visit to the exchange amid concerns at that time about a cooling economy.
But the older Bush was not selling what the younger Bush is. Today's appearance was the latest appeal in an aggressive marketing campaign for the 10-year tax-cut plan, which is shaping up as the defining battle of the new president's first year.
That campaign today centered on an expression of worry about the direction of the economy. Though his speech lasted just 13 minutes, Mr. Bush made a second mention of making "sure this economy doesn't continue to sputter." Hours earlier, a White House spokesman, Scott McClellan, had talked to reporters of "our sputtering economy."
But another strategy Mr. Bush employed today, as in previous weeks, was presenting himself as a bipartisan, Democrat-loving kind of guy -- an image intended to undercut some critics' suggestions that his tax cut was emblematic of an extremely conservative agenda and that he was being inflexible about it.
Before his speech, he had lunch with Mayor Richard M. Daley, who is not just a Democrat but also the brother of William Daley, the chairman of Vice President Al Gore's presidential campaign.
Mr. Bush and Mayor Daley, seated at a white-clothed table with a floral centerpiece, permitted reporters, photographers and television cameras to catch a fleeting peek of them.
"I just got a lesson in Chicago politics," Mr. Bush said, referring to the conversation he had been having with Mr. Daley. He added that it was his second lesson "in six months." The first, apparently, had been losing the state of Illinois to Mr. Gore.
During his subsequent speech, Mr. Bush said of Mr. Daley: "He's a really good mayor. He's a good mayor of a big city. We've had our time for politics; now it's time to do what's right for our country and for the cities."
Democrats contend that what is right for the country is a tax cut less sweeping and less generous to wealthy taxpayers than Mr. Bush's; they have proposed alternatives that they say would preserve important spending priorities or leave more money for debt repayment.
Mayor Daley did not weigh in on that debate. But President Bush's speech on the floor was aimed more directly at two Chicago-area Democrats who will be part of the House vote on Thursday on the core of his tax plan: an across-the-board reduction in tax rates. Administration officials said they hoped both Democrats -- Representatives Rod R. Blagojevich and William O. Lipinski of Illinois -- might back the president.
An aide to Mr. Blagojevich said today that the congressman was officially undecided but unlikely to vote for the plan. But an aide to Mr. Lipinski suggested he was more favorably inclined toward the tax cut.
Unlike Mr. Blagojevich, Mr. Lipinski was on the floor of the exchange, and he flew back to Washington aboard Air Force One this evening so that he could talk with Mr. Bush. Speaker J. Dennis Hastert was also on the flight.
Mr. Bush alluded to that conversation in his speech, saying of Mr. Lipinski: "He and I will have a little quality time together."
And Mr. Bush again made a direct appeal to voters: "I'm here to ask for your help. See, I believe in the power of the people. I truly do. I do.
"I believe that when you e-mail a congressman or a senator, it makes a difference. It makes a difference. And so that's why I'm traveling the country. And that's why I came here."

HEADLINE: Wiring the City: Humans Won't Do 

BYLINE:  By JOHN SCHWARTZ 

DATELINE: ALBUQUERQUE 

 BODY:
MANHOLE 465 is a "good hole," the crew says, cleaner than most and surprisingly free of roaches. I am standing at the bottom of the 12-foot-deep shaft, straddling a narrow channel of greasy, gray water that courses between my high-water boots. Sitting complacently in the channel is a long, thin robot on wheels: the Sewer Access Module, or SAM. The robot is far more comfortable in this dank environment than I am. For one thing, it's waterproof. Also, SAM doesn't have a nose. 
 The robot was created to fulfill a dream: laying fiber-optic cable within city sewer systems. Owned by CityNet Telecommunications Inc., a new company in Silver Spring, Md., the device, which looks a little like the unlikely offspring of a dachshund and an Electrolux vacuum cleaner, is on its first American mission. If all works as planned, efforts like this promise sweet relief to Americans nationwide who have sacrificed their shock absorbers, wheels and lower backs to streets turned into washboards by companies cutting and repaving streets to lay the "last mile" of fiber-optic cable. 
 The slender strands of ultraclear glass that make up fiber-optic cable are the path of choice for high-speed voice and data communications. Cities hoping to attract and hold on to high-tech business know they need to upgrade from the old copper wires snaking through their phone networks, and companies are rushing to fill in the remaining distance between the major switching stations and the businesses that will actually hook up to them. CityNet asserts that its methods are 60 percent faster than street-cutting methods and that its costs are comparable to those of damaging road work.
The company's chief executive, Robert G. Berger, said the idea of using municipal water systems to deliver bursts of laser light came to him in the shower. His background had prepared him for the epiphany: Mr. Berger, a telecommunications lawyer, was serving his second term on the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission. "I was looking up at the water, washing the shampoo out of my hair, and said: 'Oh, my gosh! I'm a water and sewer commissioner -- it's the one infrastructure that goes everywhere.' " 
Mr. Berger's ideas had to change somewhat over time: his first idea was to use the water supply system, not the sewers, but the high water pressure, small pipes and safety concerns led him instead to the other end of the water system. 
And, inevitably, to robots. Although sewer pipes come in many sizes, few can accommodate a person. Robots, however, come in all shapes and sizes; and when the science fiction visionaries promised that some day robots would handle the dirty tasks that humans would abhor, well, this was exactly the sort of thing they were talking about. 
At a trade show, Mr. Berger discovered Ka-Te System A.G., a Swiss company that made sewer-roving robots for maintenance work; it had developed a robot that was laying fiber-optic cable in Hamburg, Germany. CityNet bought the North American rights to SAM's and ordered three. The robots, command truck and other equipment cost about $900,000 for each team, the company says. 
Robots do not take humans out of the muck entirely, however. Somebody has to get the robot into the manholes, to build in the "slack boxes" that allow the connections from the fiber-optic network into buildings, and to take on other tasks, sometimes unpleasant. It's a dirty job, but somebody's got to do it. 
Under any circumstances, sewers can be dangerous places. The workers who call themselves "sewer rats" can be asphyxiated or choke on toxic fumes; people routinely pour poisons into the sewer system for illegal but convenient disposal. And that doesn't count other hazards, says Scotty Freeman, a lanky Texan who is safety manager for Carter-Burgess, the company's engineering partner, enumerating a few: "Flooding. Rat snakes. Gators. Syringes." 
(Alligators? Well, not in New Mexico -- nor, as urban legend has it, in New York -- but Mr. Freeman insists a co-worker became entangled with one in a Louisiana storm drain.) 
CityNet workers get extensive, continuing training in the risks of close-quarters work and are vaccinated against tetanus and hepatitis A. "This is the safest sewer work in the country," Mr. Freeman said. 
After giving me an abbreviated version of the close-quarters training, he drives us to Manhole 465, in the middle of Tijeras Street. On this particular night, there is a desert chill in the Albuquerque air. The teams work at night to avoid snarling traffic: even though they aren't digging up the streets, the trucks and equipment still have to cluster around the manhole. The teams also find night work more hospitable because of a condition they succinctly but delicately refer to as "low flow." 
I put on the boots, a white hard hat, disposable overalls and gloves; a snug harness and cable tether me to the surface world. After workers have laid the robot at the mouth of a pipe that opens onto either side of the shaft, I go down for a look. 
I had expected to be more uncomfortable in the pit, but I had a couple of things going for me: a little spelunking experience and a college fascination with sensory deprivation tanks cured me of any fears of tight squeezes. And after a fatherly career of changing several thousand diapers, I found the atmosphere tolerable. 
Up in the mobile command center within a big CityNet truck, a member of the three-man crew sits at a computer monitor and instrument panel and nudges a nubby rubber joystick forward. The little beast creeps ahead into the 12-inch-wide clay sewer pipe on its red rubber wheels and soon disappears, dragging its control cable behind it like a thick rubber umbilical cord. 
This is the robots' third visit to the pipe: after CityNet pressure-washed the passage, it sent in the machines to map this section of Albuquerque's sewer network. A device clamped to the front of the robot shot clear video of the sewers to help plan the next trip. 
On that second trip, the robot installed the stainless steel rings that hold the fiber in place (and, as a bonus, reinforce the pipes). Its mapping rig was replaced with a magazine of 10 rings that look a little like an automobile hose clamp; on command at five-foot intervals, the robot slid each ring forward off of the magazine and moved it into position; a gear opened the spring-loaded ring until it sat snugly in place. 
On its next visit, the robot carried hollow steel conduits less than an inch in diameter: they unwound from giant spools above ground. Yet another clamp-on module with laser cable guides snapped the conduits into place, three at a time, at the top of the pipe, well above the water's usual flow. 
Tonight the company is running the machine through the pipe again to continue the mapping process and to ensure that this preliminary work was done properly. Once satisfied that all has gone well, the company will feed the fiber-optic lines through the lengths of steel cable, finishing the job. 
I emerge from the manhole to some ribbing by the workers on hand. "You'll pardon us if nobody wants to shake your hand," jokes Stephen L. Merrill, CityNet's senior vice president for engineering and operations. After I shed the harness, jumpsuit and boots and wash up with disinfectant, Mr. Merrill escorts me to the mobile command center, where I watch the robot's progress on video and on a set of graphs and dials depicted on the computer screen. 
I sit at the console and take the bot for a spin, moving it forward and back, panning the camera and working the flat stainless steel hook -- shaped like the Italian boot -- that the robots use to pull down and reposition the conduits. It's like one of those video games in which you wander down endless passages, except there are no aliens or demons to kill -- although the console operator, Chris Fields, tells me that when they get bored, they occasionally use the hook to squash roaches. 
After installing the networks, CityNet will retain ownership for 20 years and will then lease the fiber to telecommunications companies. CityNet will share 2.5 percent of the resulting revenues with the city. As part of the deal, the cities get the fiber-equipped sewers mapped, inspected and cleaned twice a year at CityNet's expense.
For Mayor Jim Baca, who is in the middle of a major project to repave his city's streets, the plan "is a win for everybody."
"It helps us wire the city with the least disruption," he said.
Mr. Berger is not the first to think of new uses for old city systems. In Chicago, telecommunications companies have taken advantage of abandoned 19th-century tunnels once used to carry coal and ice to downtown buildings. New York is studying whether it can run fiber-optic cables through an abandoned network of water mains formerly used by firefighters. 
And using sewers is not the only way to avoid digging in the streets. Along with wireless systems that beam data from building to building, some companies use horizontal drilling technology to bore under streets. Like trench cutting, however, those systems can cut through existing infrastructure: a company drilling a fiber-optic tunnel last September in Dallas broke a water main, sending millions of gallons of water through downtown streets and causing an estimated $1.5 million in damage. The drilling company says the city did not accurately mark the water main, and the case is in court. But episodes like that make Mr. Berger think he has found a winner.
Some companies with deep pockets seem to agree. CityNet has found treasure in the muck: it has raised $100 million so far and has ordered 100 new robots. Along with the Albuquerque deal, it has agreements with Omaha and Indianapolis, and is talking with several other cities. 
Terrence L. Barnich, chairman of the New Paradigm Resources Group, a telecommunications consulting company in Chicago, says the CityNet plan "really touches the core issue" by exploiting a pathway that already provides "direct access right into the building" -- potentially avoiding the need for a trench that can cost as much as $100,000 to create and fill. 
Still, he said, the overall economical advantage has yet to be proved. And as with anything involving the sewer, there is a certain image problem to overcome. When executives came to Mr. Barnich to describe their business plan, he could not keep himself from making a scatological reference to the company's work. 
Mr. Berger, he said, "just turned in his chair and said, 'You know, we've heard them all.' "

By running the cable through existing sewer lines, the company can get its cable near buildings and avoid tearing up local streets. 1. MAPPINGThe robot, with a module containing a video camera for inspection and mapping, is inserted into a sewer pipe at a manhole. A measuring wheel on the robot's side helps the crew determine the best spots for installing the mounting rings. 2. RING INSTALLATIONWhen the robot reaches the next manhole, the inspection module is removed and two other modules, one that carries a supply of mounting rings and the other that installs them, are attached. The robot then backs down the pipe, and when it reaches the appropriate spot, mechanical arms grasp a ring from the supply module and a gear expands the ring, much like a hose clamp, until it is flush with the inside of the pipe. The robot then moves on to install the next ring. 3. CONDUIT AND CABLEOn a third pass down the pipe, the robot is equipped with a module to install the conduit. The module includes a laser so that an operator canalign the conduit with clamps in the mounting ring. Then the robot pushesthe conduit into the clamps. Fiber optic cable is snaked through the conduit later. Photo of robot describing all it's various parts. ON THE STREETWorkers lower the robot into the manhole, insert it into the sewer pipe and monitor and control its operation. All the robot modules include video cameras so that operators can see what is going on. (Sources: CityNet Telecommunications Inc., Ka-Te System A.G.)(pg. G7)

HEADLINE: Australia Lowers Rate 0.25 Point 

BYLINE:  By BECKY GAYLORD

DATELINE: SYDNEY, Australia, March 7 

 BODY:
With fresh data showing that Australia's economy has begun to contract after almost 10 years of continuous growth, the central bank reduced its benchmark interest rate today for the second time in four weeks. 
 Against a global backdrop of weakening growth and falling interest rates -- Canada's central bank cut its rates on Tuesday in a bid to ward off recession -- the Reserve Bank of Australia was spurred to act today by a slide in business confidence, a softening labor market and concerns that the economy has stopped growing. A new report released a few hours after the bank's rate announcement said that gross domestic product shrank 0.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2000. 
 The bank lowered its cash rate, charged on overnight loans to banks, to 5.50 percent from 5.75 percent, where it had been since the half-point reduction in February.
Ian Macfarlane, the governor of the bank, said in a statement that past worries about upward price pressures had long since receded, leaving room to ease monetary policy. "The outlook for inflation is now more secure," Mr. Macfarlane said. 
Not so the outlook for economic expansion. "Prospects for the international economy have deteriorated further," Mr. Macfarlane said, while at home, "the economy weakened quite markedly towards the end of 2000 and remained weak in the first months of 2001."
Along with the 0.6 percent decline in G.D.P., the report listed overall growth of 2.1 percent for 2000. Economists, on average, had forecast a flat economy in the fourth quarter and 3 percent growth for the year. 
Together, the interest rate cut and evidence of the economy's slump sent the value of the Australian dollar slipping to just over 51 cents against the United States dollar, close to its historic low. 
Softness in the housing sector dragged on the economy late last year, and approved building applications for new homes and apartments fell 40 percent in January 2001 from January 2000. Business spending on plants and equipment also was sluggish in the fourth quarter. 
"There is a risk that recent weakness, coupled with lower levels of business confidence now prevailing, could continue to dampen growth," Mr. Macfarlane said.
The outlook for some economic indicators like employment is also worsening, and some analysts said they expected further steps to ease monetary policy, perhaps in April.

HEADLINE: Consumer Borrowing Accelerated in January 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 7 

 BODY:
Borrowing by consumers increased more than expected in January as spending picked up from a fourth-quarter lull and higher energy costs made repaying debt harder, Federal Reserve reports showed today.
The rise of $16 billion in outstanding consumer debt, bringing the total to $1.5 trillion, followed a December gain of $7.2 billion, a Fed report showed. 
The rise reflected the largest increase in credit card debt since August. Other loans also increased.
The numbers suggest that Americans are less discouraged by rising energy costs and job cuts than typical measures of confidence indicate. "People don't borrow unless they are reasonably confident of their jobs and prospects," said William Sullivan, an economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in New York.
At the same time, the Fed's latest regional economic survey found evidence that people paid off a smaller portion of their credit card balances because of surging costs of electricity and natural gas used to heat homes.
"Higher energy costs also were cited as contributing to an increase in default rates on auto and home-equity loans, although this effect was expected to be transitory," the Fed survey, known as the beige book, said. Energy prices rose 3.9 percent in January, the Labor Department reported last month.
The beige book, a compilation of anecdotal reports from 12 regional Fed banks, showed that the record economic expansion finished its 10th year with "sluggish to modest" growth and a declining demand for workers.
 "Consumer spending rose slightly in most districts in January and February as retailers offered deep discounts on winter merchandise," the report stated. "Auto sales were generally steady, but below last year's rate."

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Economic Growth Continues to Slow in Most Areas"A roundup of regional economic conditions in recent months for the Federal Reserve's 12 districts, according to the beige book report issued by the Fed yesterday. Minneapolis -- Mining, manufacturing and agriculture were "in the doldrums." San Francisco -- Moderate to weak retail sales. Farmers endured low crop prices and high costs. Credit markets tightened. Chicago -- Retail sales grew in response to major price discounting. Manufacturing was soft. Cleveland -- Economic growth was weak. Residential construction and real estate were steady. The unemployment rate remained low. Boston -- Economic growth continued to slow. Slower demand was reported by several industries. Prices remained stable. New York -- Economic growth continued at a moderate pace. Banks reported that the demand for consumer loans was weak. Philadelphia -- Manufacturing declined but auto sales were steady. Retail sales rose amid markdowns to reduce inventories. Richmond -- Economic growth was sluggish. Retail sales were weak. Prices continued to rise modestly. Atlanta -- Economic growth was "tepid." Prices were stable. Manufacturing declined. Low mortgage rates helped housing. St. Louis -- Economic activity slowed in the region. Energy costs were high and manufacturing weak. Home building slowed. Kansas City -- Retail sales were soft. Commercial construction and manufacturing both declined. High energy costs hurt farmers. Dallas -- Regional economic growth cooled. Orders fell for several manufacturers but construction-related manufacturing rebounded slightly. (Source: Bloomberg News)

HEADLINE: Behave or Face a Diamond Ban, Security Council Tells Liberians 

BYLINE:  By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, March 7 

 BODY:
The Security Council voted unanimously today to bar all diamond exports from the West African nation of Liberia if the country does not stop supporting a rebel army that has ravaged neighboring Sierra Leone. The embargo and a ban on travel by Liberia's president, Charles Taylor, will take effect on May 7 if the council's demands are not met.
 The council, led by the United States and Britain, had wanted to impose new sanctions earlier, after an investigation panel reported late last year that Liberia was being used by the Sierre Leone rebel group, the Revolutionary United Front, to sell diamonds for weapons. Liberia has been under an arms embargo since 1992 because of its own civil war. 
 But nations belonging to the Economic Community of West African States, or Ecowas, which will have to monitor and enforce the resolution, wanted more time.
In today's resolution, Liberia was asked to cut off links and stop sending aid to the rebel group, known as the R.U.F. The council also demanded that Liberia ground its aircraft until it completes an acceptable registration system for planes. The investigation panel reported last year that Liberian planes were involved in the region in dubious, if not illegal, activities.
"The message that I hope the Liberians will get," said James B. Cunningham, the United States representative on the council, "is that, as the Security Council mission said and others in the region have been saying for a long time, we think that President Taylor and his government bear a special responsibility with regard to the fighting and support for the R.U.F., that they haven't broken off that support and that the council is not satisfied with the case that they've made, with the explanations they provided."
The Liberians deny that they are still behind the Sierra Leone war, which has been marked by savage butchery. President Taylor has also said he has ended air violations. If sanctions are imposed, the travel ban on Mr. Taylor would extend to his family and other Liberian officials. 
In an attempt at a pre-emptive move, Liberia said today that it would suspend diamond exports for 120 days until it could create a gem certification system to meet international standards for identifying the origin of diamonds for sale.
Sir Jeremy Greenstock, Britain's ambassador to the United Nations, said today that certification was not the point. "The council demands no diamonds be exported until President Taylor has fully met the requirements of the resolution we just passed," he said.
Mr. Cunningham said that the initial African reluctance to support new sanctions on Liberia was a "tactical difference" with the council, not opposition to the move.
"We've had a long discussion with them about what the best tactic is here -- whether to just give him time and see what happens or whether it's better to put this sword into place and use that as extra leverage," he said of regional African leaders. "We think this actually increases Ecowas's leverage to work with Taylor because there is now something specific in place that will happen if there isn't a performance."

Priceline Extends Late Booking for Travel

BYLINE:  By JANE L. LEVERE

 BODY:
Priceline.com, the online company that lets customers bid to buy discount airline tickets, hotel rooms and other items, is extending its last-minute booking feature to all of its travel services.
 The company, which started with great fanfare almost three years ago, but more recently has posted widening losses and plunging sales, is allowing its customers to buy airline tickets as late as 6 p.m. on the day before their departure. They can also book a hotel room until 6 p.m. for a stay the same evening or rent a car and pick it up within four hours. 
 Priceline, which is based in Norwalk, Conn., has offered the last-minute booking feature for air travel since its start-up. The last-minute hotel booking option was introduced last month, while the last-minute car rental option is being introduced this week. Last-minute booking is available to buyers of electronic tickets for domestic flights on the eight United States airlines in Priceline's travel program. One-fourth of the 6,000 hotels in the United States and Canada whose rooms it sells are offering last-minute booking, as are all five of the car rental companies it represents. Dan Schulman, president and chief executive of Priceline, said the last-minute booking option would let the company serve a new segment of the marketplace.
"There's good room for us to grow in this segment," he said.
Michael Legg, who follows Priceline for Jefferies & Company, said last-minute booking would benefit consumers, but he predicted that it would not mean much for the company "from the profitability perspective."
Henry Harteveldt, a senior analyst with Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass., said Priceline's last-minute booking options would "make the site more appealing to price-sensitive budget travelers."
He warned, however, that the company would have to "manage people's expectations; there may or may not be a lot of choices available."
Priceline posted an operating loss of $25 million in the fourth quarter of last year, after approaching break-even on an operating basis in the first three quarters.

Storm Of Hype

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

 BODY:
The TV weatherpeople flew into a blizzy. "The East's worst storm in 50 years" was predicted in a tone of confident panic. Phrases like "three feet of snow" were bandied about as weathercasters in front of jerkily moving radar maps explained with certitude how the winter storm would stall, lashing the region for days. 
 Accordingly, alarmed educators closed schools; airlines canceled hundreds of flights; AT&T in New Jersey told 19,000 employees to stay home; grocery store shelves were ransacked for milk and bread lest marooned apartment dwellers starve. The drumbeat of doom over the airwaves and in print broke dates, postponed meetings, lost audiences. 
 And what happened to the prediction-paralyzed big cities? Nothing much; Washington got a dusting of snow, New York a few inches. To some, the non-nor'easter came as a blessed relief; to most, it was kind of a letdown. The New York Times, which had postponed an annual meeting of employees because of "inclement weather," noted tersely the next day that snowfall had been "generally short of predictions."
Journalists who hyped the story, hoping to cover themselves with glory by covering a disaster, found themselves hastening to cover their posteriors. Pictures rained down on viewers and readers of snowbound Saratoga Springs or Syracuse, where you can always get pictures of falling snow, or of the icy misery in Boston, where winter is always miserable.
An A.P. feature writer looking for storm-tossed heroism was reduced to reporting from Rye, N.H., that a seal had been pitched over the seawall onto the coastal highway, where a man and his two sons wrapped it in a blanket and tossed it back into the Atlantic. "He waited for the waves and then took off," said the rescuer. 
To be sure (this is known in the column dodge as "the to-be-sure graph"), power outages caused genuine suffering in some areas, and "weather-related loss of life" undoubtedly took place. 
But the non-blizzard of '01 was a day late and a disaster short. We cannot fault the Almighty for being merciful, but isn't there somebody we can blame for being misleading? At whom can we rail for causing economic losses and human discombobulation? 
The genial weathercasters shrug sheepishly and say: Gee, we rely on the National Weather Service. If those guys tell us a Big One is coming, we get more air time, more viewers, more advertisers and more exposure to national media barons. Sunshine is a ratings-killer, but a major winter storm means Gucci galoshes for our spouses. Thus to the TV news axiom "If it bleeds, it leads" weatherpeople add their corollary, "If it blows, it goes." 
This media bias toward bad-weather news is reinforced by career protection within the weather bureau and among private forecasters. On one hand, they assure us that satellites and computers make forecasting more accurate; contrariwise, they warn us that meteorology (the study of the atmosphere, and not, as logic suggests, watching for meteors) is still an inexact science. When those assurances and warnings conflict, the meteorologist coolly reaches for the panic button; it's wiser to be derided for alarmism than furiously denounced for complacency. Better safe and looking silly than sorry and getting fired.
When both the scientific source of news (the National Weather Service) and the purveyor of news (the precipitation press) share a bias toward erring on the side of shouting "Batten down the hatches!" what is the consumer of weather news to do?
First, learn the difference between a "weather advisory" and a "storm warning." It is the difference between a stock analyst's "hold" (which means "do nothing until I tell you to sell") and "sell" ("bail out now that everybody else has"). Tune out the weathercaster whose source hunts headlines with phrases like "storm of the century."
Then demand a prediction scorecard. I make a dozen political predictions at year's end, and get three right in a good year (as President McCain can testify). What media critics will run a public check on panic-prone snowflake savants? 
Finally, whether contemplating actual darkening skies or the metaphoric storm clouds of recession, factor in the countervailing optimism expressed by Al Smith in the economic depths of 1931: "The American people never carry an umbrella. They prepare to walk in eternal sunshine."

HEADLINE: Yahoo Warns on Sales, and Its Chief Resigns 

BYLINE:  By SAUL HANSELL

 BODY:
Timothy A. Koogle resigned yesterday as the chief executive of Yahoo, as the company warned that its sales in the first quarter would be far worse than its pessimistic prediction in January.
 Yahoo, which serves 185 million users, is the biggest Internet company that mainly derives revenue from advertising and one of the few that earns a profit. 
 But with the market for Internet advertising drying up, the company, which operates an Internet portal, now says it expects sales of $170 million to $180 million for the quarter, its lowest level since the end of 1999. At the end of last year, analysts had expected Yahoo to report $320 million in sales in the quarter. Then in January the company lowered its expected sales to $220 million to $240 million. 
Mr. Koogle, who is 49, said he decided it was time to bring in a new chief executive to add a fresh perspective to the company.
"This is a decision to augment our team," Mr. Koogle said in a brief interview yesterday. "We wanted to have a new partner in place when we began to emerge from the current softness."
Mr. Koogle said he would remain chairman. Jeffrey Mallett, 35, the president and chief operating officer, will not be a candidate for chief executive, Yahoo said.
Analysts said the steep drop-off in sales undermined the credibility of a company that had been seen as one of the best managed on the Internet.
"For five years this was the one company you could go to sleep at night not worrying about," said Paul Noglows, an analyst with J. P. Morgan H & Q. "You knew they would outperform and outexecute. Now it will take a long hard building process to restore credibility."
Despite Yahoo's woes, analysts do not worry about its survival as much as they do with other Internet companies like Amazon.com, which still has huge losses. Yahoo has $1.7 billion in cash. Indeed, it announced yesterday that it would spend up to $500 million to buy back its own shares.
Yahoo announced the resignation yesterday at 5 p.m., after an unusual halt in the trading of its stock by the Nasdaq that began seven minutes after trading began at 9:30 a.m. Yahoo had been planning to announce Mr. Koogle's resignation today. As a result, Susan L. Decker, its chief financial officer, canceled a scheduled appearance today. Yahoo's shares dropped as analysts speculated on what would cause Ms. Decker to abruptly change her plans. 
Officials of the Nasdaq called Yahoo executives yesterday morning, but they were not available that early in their Santa Clara, Calif., headquarters. So they halted trading on Yahoo's shares. Once they were reached, Yahoo executives rushed to move up their announcement. But they were not able to prepare a script for their conference call until the end of the day.
When trading finally resumed, shares of Yahoo fell. They closed at $21, but fell as low as $17.88 in after-hours trading, the lowest level since September 1998. In January 2000, Yahoo briefly hit $250 a share. Yahoo now has a market value of $11.7 billion. 
Yahoo said its sales were off because advertising from Internet companies has fallen far faster than expected. At the same time, with the economy slowing, the established national advertisers that Yahoo was counting on to replace the dot-com companies have been slow to commit themselves to new spending.
Yahoo has said that it hopes to make up for the advertising shortfall by increasing sales of fee-based services to businesses and consumers. But these efforts have fallen short so far. It recently imposed fees to list items on its auction service, which had been free. Its listings dropped by 90 percent. 
The company, which had had an unusually stable management team, has recently had quite a bit of turnover. The heads of three of the company's international units have left in the last month. And it has been searching, so far unsuccessfully, for a new head of advertising sales to replace Anil Singh, who has held that position since 1996 but is moving to an unspecified position.
Earlier this month, Yahoo adopted a series of antitakeover provisions. That is unusual, especially considering that the Softbank Corporation of Japan, and its two founders, Jerry Yang and David Filo, control 37 percent of Yahoo's shares.
Mr. Koogle became Yahoo's chief executive in 1995 as it was being transformed from a hobby of Mr. Yang and Mr. Filo into a business. He had worked mainly in the telecommunications equipment business at Motorola and Western Atlas.
A musician and race car driver in his spare time, Mr. Koogle has styled himself as a cool and detached strategist, leaving much of the job of communicating the company's story internally and externally to the more outgoing Mr. Mallett. Mr. Koogle's trademark has been financial and strategic discipline. 
Yahoo has hired Spencer Stuart, a leading executive recruiting firm, to help find its new chief executive.
Jeffery Christian, the headhunter with Christian & Timbers, said Yahoo would have a hard time recruiting a name-brand executive with widespread recognition, given its current condition. 
Mr. Christian is handling the search for a new chief executive for Excite@Home, a Yahoo rival.

The East Is Blue and Orange as Hip-Hop Invades

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

DATELINE: BEIJING, March 7 

 BODY:
The 10 teenagers had already survived rigorous exams and months of training under the tutelage of foreign coaches.
 They had practiced dawn to dusk for weeks on end. And now, with their first big test just three days away, everyone in the studio at the state radio station was naturally nervous. 
 Their moms looked on as the coaches put the group through its paces. They clucked and ran to buy fruit and cold medicine for a teenager who was feeling ill. 
The gangly kids chatted, mouthed their lines, and stole frequent glances at their newly minted selves in a big wall of mirrors: 10 teenagers, many just out of high school, now in matching silvery car coats, big baggy pants and Nikes. Ten teenagers -- on the verge of stardom? -- with newly dyed hair in clashing shades of red, blue, yellow and orange.
"Our goal is to develop hip-hop and R & B with Chinese characteristics," said Chen Xu, 19, the charismatic chief rapper of the new group, T.N.T., wearing tinted glasses and red dreadlocked hair. "I hope to make this a career."
In the United States, rap and hip-hop grew out of the streets. But here, a campaign to create home-grown hip-hop performers is, like so much in China, the product of scientific planning, government intervention, expert input, and, of course, tests.
The results of the six-month effort are the boy band T.N.T. and a girl band, Tinkerbell, as well as a soloist, Annie. They recently made their debut at the Workers Stadium auditorium, clad in clothes that would have done Puff Daddy proud: silver track suits, oversized white tuxedos and Goth black tunics and pants.
The impulse to create a home-grown boy band a la America's Backstreet Boys evolved from a strange mix of nationalism and economic opportunity.
China has a small indigenous hip-hop scene, mostly centered on clubs in Shanghai. But far more influential is a Korean hip-hop band called H.O.T. (High Five of Teenagers), probably the most popular group among Chinese teens. Their CD's are best sellers, and Chinese teenagers hang on H.O.T. gossip and news.
Under the influence of "Korean hip-hop" culture, Chinese teenagers have started wearing baggy jeans and getting neon hair rinses. In the Xidan district of Beijing, the store of the moment is Korea Fashion City. 
So last year, state-run China Radio International teamed up with a South Korean music company to create a home-grown band that could catch this wave, using a method that has worked so well for other Chinese industries: they copied.
"Our company knew that hip-hop and R and B were popular in China, but there is no real expertise in these areas," said Chay Bok Nyeo, a Korean manager of the China New Millennium Dance Group, which is sponsoring the new bands. "Still, we knew there were talented kids out there, so we put an ad out and thousands answered."
The talent hunt was largely directed and financed from Seoul. Applicants came to Beijing, where Korean experts systematically evaluated their singing and dancing as well as their looks, image, personality and "basic skills."
Xu Yuhua, who works for the Chinese partner company, said, "It was not a talent contest; it was an exam."
In successive rounds of testing, the judges narrowed the field from more than 5,000 to just 10, all 16 to 19 years old, from places as varied as Beijing, Hong Kong and rural Hebei Province. One was a student at Beijing's No. 2 Middle School. Mr. Chen, the rapper, was a freshman at a Beijing university. Another was in flight attendant school.
Of course, this was not the kind of exam success that Chinese parents traditionally fantasize about, and some were less than thrilled.
"My mother thought that after three years of study I should become a flight attendant," said Li Miao, 18, who now looks very unstewardessy, with a bulky two-tone sweatshirt and shaggy, blond-streaked hair.
But China and its aspirations are changing fast.
"We're very open-minded, so we felt he should be able to chose," said Xiao Lijie, Mr. Chen's mother.
She said, proudly, that in Harbin, the family's hometown in China's far northeast, Mr. Chen is known as the "dance king" on the club circuit and has his own successful band.
"He's got innate talent," she said. "He can study any time, but this is a rare opportunity."
After the exam results were announced, the 10 winners were whisked away to Seoul for three months of "intensive training," which included lessons in singing and dancing, fashion, makeup, etiquette and public speaking. Composers wrote songs for them; image consultants made over their dress and their hair.
They trained as if preparing for an Olympic event, with nine hours of practice a day. Though few had ever been outside China before, they were allowed just one day of sightseeing during their stint at hip-hop boot camp.
"'I learned to be more polite, how to sing and dance better -- and also developed a new style," said Zheng Xin, 18, who last year was attending performing arts school in Hebei and now, in the studio, was wearing baggy jeans and a fuzzy pink sweater, with bright red streaks through her yellow hair.
Three days later the 10 were making their debut on stage, skipping and strutting through clouds of fake smoke, rapping and singing of lost love and other teenage cares.
The crowd clapped along enthusiastically as a traditional Chinese tune, "Kangding Love Song," was performed in rap style. Light sticks sailed down onto the vast stage, and balloons scribbled with the new stars' names filled the air.
"You're seeing for the first time our own Chinese Korean-style hip-hop band," an announcer thundered.
The performance was not exactly Eminem, Chen Xu's favorite artist, or even Backstreet Boys. T.N.T. has its own style, though it most resembles H.O.T. But it was clearly hip-hop with Chinese characteristics in other ways too:
The emcee for the evening was a middle-aged radio announcer in a conservative suit and red tie, who asked the audience to vote on which they preferred, the girl band or the boy band. Officials watched the concert from a row of tables, set with cups of hot tea, arranged between the audience and the stage.
In a country where rock concerts still enjoy an uncertain status, often deemed a threat to public order, the first row of the stands was fully occupied by uniformed members of the People's Armed Police.
But the mood was hardly subversive. When T.N.T., Tinkerbell and Annie finished rapping and took to the stage for the night's encore, their song was not about sex or drugs, but a paean to Beijing's glorious bid to play host to the 2008 Olympic Games.
Has Eminem mentioned that?

SATELLITE RADIO PROVIDER SECURES FUNDS

BYLINE:  By Simon Romero

 BODY:
 Sirius Satellite Radio is expected to announce today that it has secured a $150 million loan from Lehman Brothers, people close to the company said. Sirius, which plans to compete with XM Radio to provide satellite radio broadcasts to automobiles in the United States, originally sought the loan last year, but it was delayed until Sirius could show that its technology worked properly. 
Sirius recently increased its offer of stock options to Lehman in an apparent effort to pave the way for completion of the financing agreement, which will carry an interest rate of about 10 percent. With the loan and the sale of $230 million of stock last week in a transaction that was also managed by Lehman Brothers, Sirius has about $470 million on hand, easing concern over the company's financial situation, people close to the company said.

HEADLINE: Queens to Detroit: A Bangladeshi Passage 

BYLINE:  By SARAH KERSHAW 

 BODY:
At a grocery store on 30th Avenue in Astoria, Queens, the shelves are stocked with hot pickles and jackfruit, the refrigerator with blessed baby goat, the freezer with frozen fish caught in the rivers of Bangladesh.
 But business at the Bangladeshi market, Zindabazar Dhaka, has taken a plunge in the last two years, and the owner, Ahmed Kamal, had two words to explain why: "Michigan, Michigan." 
 In one of those quiet and quirky immigrant migrations that are forever altering the country's face, thousands of Bangladeshis have moved from Queens to Detroit in recent years. A function of economics, word of mouth and the slightly hard-to-figure momentum that often drives such relocations, the migration has escalated in the last year, with dozens of families packing up every month and heading from Astoria to Michigan.
The mini-exodus -- a local Bengali-language newspaper survey estimated that 8,000 had made the move in the last 18 months -- has created a Bangladeshi community on Detroit's east side and in nearby Hamtramck, a city surrounded by Detroit. And it has mildly unnerved the tight-knit collection of Bangladeshi immigrants in Queens that has, over the years, carved out a secure and reliable niche in a daunting city. 
Mashud Ahmed Chowdhury, 44, has lived in the same one-bedroom apartment in Astoria for 11 years. With his wife and two young sons, it is crowded, so Mr. Chowdhury, a cook, spent the last two years searching for an affordable two-bedroom in the area. Then, last month, he decided to move to Detroit. His friends and relatives there told him he could rent a three-bedroom house for $500, half what he is paying now, and easily find a job in one of the new Bangladeshi-owned restaurants there, he said. 
So Mr. Chowdhury's uncle in Detroit began searching for a house for his nephew, and the family is packing up, planning to leave in May.
"New York is -- what do you call it? -- survival of the fittest," Mr. Chowdhury said recently. "Many of our people, they cannot survive in New York."
The Bangladeshi departure from Queens is being driven in part by the city's real estate market: as rents rise in Astoria, an increasingly popular neighborhood for New Yorkers priced out of Manhattan, the Bangladeshis are being driven out.
By all accounts, the greatest number of Bangladeshis now living in Detroit are from Astoria and other Queens neighborhoods, while many who settled in Brooklyn or the Bronx are staying put.
Meanwhile, the Bangladeshi population in Detroit and Hamtramck is skyrocketing; from the mosques to the grocery stores, which import many Bangladeshi products from New York, to the restaurants, it seems that there is a Bangladeshi from Queens on almost every corner.
New York City cannot pinpoint the number of Bangladeshis who have left, because it tracks only the flow of immigration into the city and the numbers do not account for illegal immigration. Detailed 2000 census figures that would reflect the Bangladeshi move from New York to Detroit are not yet available. But according to several estimates, the Bangladeshi population in Detroit has grown from a few thousand in the mid-1990's to 15,000 to 20,000.
According to the Department of City Planning, about 4,000 Bangladeshi immigrants are arriving legally in New York City each year, making them one of the fastest-growing immigrant groups. The department estimates that 30,000 Bangladeshis live in the city; unofficial estimates that account for illegal immigration put the number as high as 100,000.
Michigan has significant appeal for the Bangladeshis who leave New York, where they were employed mostly in the city's restaurant and taxi industries. They say there are ample job opportunities in Detroit, in factories that produce small automobile parts and electronics. Besides less expensive housing, the key for many, most of whom are from Sylhet in northeastern Bangladesh, is the enclave itself. Many of the Bangladeshis who immigrated to Queens made the journey from Sylhet.
A small number of Bangladeshis, drawn by the promise of factory work and by their relatives' and friends' word of mouth, settled in Hamtramck and the east side of Detroit, a working-class area of modest ranch houses and apartments, about 20 years ago.
Among them was Omar Osman, a taxi driver, and Shah Abdul Khalish, a schoolteacher, who remember having to cross the border into Canada to buy spices imported from Bangladesh. Today, there are at least six Bangladeshi groceries in the area.
"Now every week, every week, they are moving from New York," said Mr. Khalish, who moved to Detroit from Bangladesh in 1982, after his father-in-law immigrated there, and is the president of the Bangladesh Association of Michigan.
It was not until the last decade that Detroit, still typically a second or third destination for newcomers to this country and still 80 percent black, began drawing immigrants.
The Detroit area has a large Arab population as well as Indians, Pakistanis, Hmong from Cambodia and a growing number of Mexicans moving in from California, but most of them live on the outskirts of the city. Hamtramck, a largely Polish city for much of the 20th century, has a long history of Eastern European immigration, with increasing numbers of Bosnians; Christian Iraqis, known as Chaldeans; and Bangladeshis now moving in.
Since the 1950's, Detroit has lost about one million people, an exodus spurred by the flight of whites to the suburbs, and it has struggled to attract residents. But experts and workers in Detroit say that even as the economic downturn makes the job market tighter, there is plenty of work in the smaller factories that supply parts to the major automobile companies, particularly for low-wage earners willing to do assembly line work.
"They are still crying for workers," said Kurt R. Metzger, director of the Michigan Metropolitan Information Center at Wayne State University, who said he had noted the rapid growth of the Bangladeshi population in the last few years, partly by examining enrollment in the public school system. "There is plenty of work here."
The Bangladeshis from New York also say that many of the smaller factories will hire members of the same family, which helps with transportation, a problem in Detroit for anyone without a car. Most of the workers rely on vans to take them to their jobs in the factories outside the city, typically paying the driver $20 a week and gathering at Bangladeshi grocery stores to wait for their rides.
Another draw for the Bangladeshis is that the Detroit area is home to one of the country's largest Muslim populations. The Bangladeshis, who have opened several mosques in the last few years, worship alongside Bosnians, African-Americans, Pakistanis and others.
Abdul Latif Azom, a Muslim imam, moved from Elmhurst, Queens, to Detroit in 1996. He now leads prayers and teaches Islamic studies at al-Falah, a rapidly growing mosque in Hamtramck that is renovating to accommodate all the new worshipers.
"It's crowded in Queens, you know, crowded like Dhaka, Bangladesh," Mr. Azom said, referring to the country's capital. "Here you have no headaches and you can park your car."
The newest restaurant in Hamtramck is Aladdin Sweets and Cafe, a franchise of the Bangladeshi restaurant chain, which has two franchises in Queens. Both of the Aladdin owners in Detroit are from Queens.
One owner, Litu Chowdhury, lived in Astoria and worked as a busboy at the Aladdin franchise in Long Island City before moving to Detroit five years ago. After working as a busboy in various Detroit restaurants, Mr. Chowdhury and his partner opened the restaurant six months ago, on Conant Avenue, across the street from a Polish delicatessen.
Even the president of the Astoria Islamic Foundation, a Muslim cultural center that includes the largest Bangladeshi mosque in Queens, is living in Detroit, traveling from his home on the city's outskirts to Astoria every few months to take care of foundation business.
"They wanted me to stay on as president one more year," said the foundation's president, Gazanfar Chowdhury, who moved to Michigan from Queens two years ago, closing the paper he had published in New York, The Weekly Sangbad.
In Queens, all of this migration to Detroit has some Bangladeshis feeling slightly abandoned.
Lately, it seems that every time Abdul Chowdhury, who is known at Shahin and owns an Indian restaurant in Astoria, calls a friend or relative he has to dial 313, the area code for Detroit and Hamtramck.
"I was very proud of our community," said Mr. Chowdhury, who immigrated to Queens from Bangladesh in 1985. "It was getting bigger and bigger, but all of the sudden it's going down. Definitely, I feel bad."
Soon Mr. Chowdhury will say goodbye to another friend, Mashud Chowdhury, the man who is preparing to leave Astoria with his family within a month.
The other week, Mashud Chowdhury said his uncle in Detroit had found a house for the family. Still, he said, he has mixed feelings about leaving New York.
"I love New York; it's a wonderful place," he said. "There's a life over here. The city never sleeps. I think Michigan sleeps after 7 o'clock."

AREA ECONOMIC GROWTH CONTINUES

BYLINE:  By Leslie Eaton 

 BODY:
 The economy continues to grow in the New York region, while conditions are less rosy in parts of the Midwest, according to a report released yesterday by the Federal Reserve Board. The condition of New York's economy remains "generally favorable, with growth continuing at a moderate pace," according to the report, known as the Beige Book, which the Fed issues eight times a year. 
While Manhattan's housing market "appears to be retreating from the extraordinary levels seen through most of last year," commercial real estate construction and leasing in the region and residential real estate construction and sales outside the city are still robust. Nationally, much of the recent economic slowdown has been concentrated in areas with a lot of manufacturing. Leslie Eaton

CONNECTICUT PRODUCTIVITY

BYLINE:  By Paul Zielbauer 

 BODY:
 A study by the Manufacturing Alliance of Connecticut ranks state manufacturers among the most productive in the nation, but also concludes that Connecticut is the third-most-expensive state in which to do business. 
The study, released Tuesday, credited the state's educated work force and number of jobs in the technology and research sectors for manufacturing productivity that ranked behind only Washington, Massachusetts and Maryland. Last year, Connecticut ranked seventh. But only Louisiana and Hawaii had higher manufacturing costs than Connecticut, which has high taxes and high medical and energy costs, the report said.

Official's Remarks Depress Yen

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
The yen fell against the dollar again yesterday after Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa of Japan suggested that he was not opposed to letting foreign-exchange traders drive the yen's exchange rate lower.
 The dollar traded as high as 120.21 yen after the remarks before settling in New York at 119.86 yen, up from 118.86 on Tuesday. It had not been weaker than 120 yen since July 1999. 
 "What else can the Japanese do at this point," aside from let the yen weaken, said Joe Portera, managing director of the MacKay Shields Financial Corporation's global fixed-income group, which manages about $1 billion in assets.
Mr. Miyazawa said he did not plan any active attempt to weaken the yen, though he did not oppose a "natural" decline, and he noted that it was difficult to control currency levels.
A weak yen has some advantages for export-driven Japan; it could help revive the economy by making Japanese goods cheaper abroad.
Traders began selling yen after comments by the governor of the Japanese central bank, Masaru Hayami, convinced some that the bank was considering a policy of deliberately weakening the yen.
Japan's currency has dropped about 5 percent against the dollar this year. The economy shrank 0.6 percent in the July-September quarter, and the jobless rate remained at a record high of 4.9 percent in January.
Speculation is also brewing that the central bank will soon buy government bonds or further ease monetary policy, lowering already nominal interest rates and the value of the yen. On Feb. 28, the bank unexpectedly cut its benchmark overnight interest rate by 10 basis points, to 0.15 percent. Analysts called it a symbolic move.
"The dollar is taking a front seat as Japan is moving clearly toward a domestic recession," said Dirk Morris, head of global currencies at Putnam Investments in Boston, who helps manage about $50 billion. "They're trying to devalue their way out of their problems."

HEADLINE: Greenspan Asks Bankers to Lend, Not Shrink Back 

BYLINE:  By Reuters

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, said yesterday that it was not surprising that a weaker economy was making bankers wary about lending, but he urged them not to carry such caution to excess.
 "Lenders and their supervisors should be mindful," Mr. 
Greenspan told the Independent Community Bankers of America in Las Vegas, "that in their zeal to make up for past excesses, they do not overcompensate and inhibit or cut off the flow of credit to borrowers with credible prospects." The Fed chief canceled a trip to the meeting because of a cold, and delivered his remarks over a video link. 
 He said some bankers, accustomed to the last decade of growth, might be overreacting to problems. "It is interesting to note," Mr. Greenspan said, "that the length of the current expansion, coupled with the absence of problem commercial loans until recently, has led to some depreciation in both bankers' and supervisors' skill in handling weakened or troubled credits."
His remarks implied that the Fed remained acutely aware of problems caused by the credit squeeze of the late 1980's that lingered into the early 90's, when banks were reluctant to lend and economic growth was hampered. 
Mr. Greenspan made no comment on the outlook for interest rates. The policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee is scheduled to meet next on March 20.

House Rejects Injury Rules A Day After Senate Action
The House voted narrowly to repeal new workplace safety regulations, just a day after the Senate voted to rescind the same rules.
 This rapid-fire, one-two punch represented the first joint legislative attack on the record of former President Bill Clinton, who issued the regulations in what he called an effort to combat the wave of injuries resulting from repetitive motions on the job. The White House has said it supports the repeal. Page A19.

Gas Pipelines Inhibit Expansion
In the scramble to produce more natural gas and deliver it to market, the industry and the government are running into a problem that is hard to reconcile: the same people who swear by the virtues of natural gas tend to swear at gas pipelines, whose susceptibility to explosions, though infrequent, is sometimes seen as making them the worst of neighbors.

HEADLINE: BUSH TELLS SEOUL TALKS WITH NORTH WON'T RESUME NOW 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 7 

 BODY:
President Bush told President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea today that he would not resume missile talks with North Korea anytime soon, putting aside the Clinton administration's two-year campaign for a deal and the eventual normalization of relations with the reclusive Communist state.
 Mr. Bush's comments, while couched in reassuring statements about the American alliance with South Korea, came as a clear rebuff to President Kim. Awarded last year's Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to open dialogue across one of the most heavily armed borders on earth, the South Korean leader has told American officials that he believes there is only a narrow window of opportunity to seize on North Korea's recent willingness to emerge from its diplomatic seclusion. 
 Just days before President Kim arrived, one of his top advisers said in an interview that "timing is critical" and expressed concern that North Korea might retreat to its hard-line positions if it concluded that the new administration in Washington was not willing to pick up where Mr. Clinton -- who was planning a last-minute trip to North Korea -- left off. 
Today Mr. Bush made it clear that he had little intention of following Mr. Clinton's path, at least not now. In a brief exchange with reporters after meeting Mr. Kim in the Oval Office, Mr. Bush said: "We're not certain as to whether or not they're keeping all terms of all agreements."
But the United States has only one agreement with North Korea -- the 1994 accord that froze North Korea's plutonium processing at a suspected nuclear weapons plant. And at a briefing this afternoon two senior administration officials, asked about the president's statement, said there was no evidence that North Korea is violating its terms.
Later, a White House spokesman said that Mr. Bush was referring to his concern about whether the North would comply with future accords, even though he did not use the future tense. "That's how the president speaks," the official said. 
Mr. Bush had said, "When you make an agreement with a country that is secretive, how are you aware as to whether or not they are keeping the terms of the agreement?"
The White House insisted that today's meeting was cordial, and said that Mr. Bush embraced Mr. Kim's "vision of peace on the Korean Peninsula." But they also distanced Mr. Bush from the details of that vision, including Mr. Kim's statements, outside the meeting today, that he plans to sign a peace "declaration" with North Korea if its leader, Kim Jong Il, visits Seoul this spring.
American officials said that President Kim Dae Jung made no specific references to those plans today. But he did promise, during the brief encounter with reporters, that "we will consult with the United States every step of the way."
Nonetheless, Mr. Kim, sitting next to Mr. Bush in the Oval Office, offered a tepid assessment of his conversation with the American president. "The greatest outcome today has to be that, through a frank and honest exchange of views on the situation on the Korean Peninsula, we have increased the mutual understanding," Mr. Kim said, using a phrase often used in diplomacy to skim past substantive disagreement.
He added later that President Bush, who has visited Asia only once, a trip to China a quarter-century ago, "was very frank and honest in sharing with me his perceptions about the nature of North Korea and the North Korean leader."
President Kim had dinner tonight with about 20 American experts on Korea and, according to one participant, basically said that President Bush was very, very suspicious of the North Koreans. But Mr. Kim told the group that Mr. Bush did nothing to discourage a second North Korea-South Korea summit meeting, and he expressed concern at the dinner that the American news media would focus on the differences between Seoul and Washington rather than the strength of their alliance. 
Mr. Kim also used the dinner to sound a more cautious note about North Korea than he has in recent weeks, emphasizing, as Mr. Bush did, the need for a way to verify any future agreements. 
In another sign of Washington's new, harder line toward North Korea, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell appeared to back away from his statements on Tuesday that he hoped to "pick up where President Clinton and his administration left off." His comments seemed at odds with those of a senior administration official who had invited a group of reporters to the White House that same day to stress that a complete review of North Korea policy was under way.
Today General Powell stepped out of the Oval Office meeting to tell reporters that North Korea was "a threat" and "we have to not be naive about the nature of this threat, but at the same time realize that changes are taking place."
"There are suggestions that there are imminent negotiations about to take place" between the United States and North Korea, General Powell added. "That is not the case." 
That is a political blow to Mr. Kim, who has hoped to leverage his status as a Nobel laureate and his long history as South Korea's most prominent dissident voice during a series of military governments to negotiate a broad peace on the Korean Peninsula.
But he knows that he has little time. Mr. Kim has less than two years left in office, not long to put together all the moving parts of a deal: An agreement to stop North Korea's missile and nuclear programs, a pullback from the Demilitarized Zone, and full commercial interactions between the two Koreas. 
Even as Mr. Kim's international stature has grown, his influence in Seoul is ebbing. After presiding over South Korea's revival from the Asian economic crisis, he has seen country's economy once again decline. Opposition leaders, including his predecessor, Kim Young Sam, have charged him with naivete in dealing with the North. 
Mr. Bush's new administration is struggling to bridge differences within the Republican Party over how to deal with the North Korean threat.
Conservatives in the party have long been critical of the 1994 "Agreed Framework," struck by the Clinton administration after a confrontation over nuclear inspections. 
Under the agreement, North Korea froze its nuclear-processing operations, and international inspectors regularly monitor compliance. But conservatives and other critics say that the West essentially gave in to blackmail, offering to build two nuclear power plants for the North and supply it with fuel oil until construction is completed. Mr. Bush's aides have said they will respect the deal, but some want to reopen it, in hopes of replacing the two plants with coal-fired generators that would not create more nuclear waste.
Mr. Kim, meanwhile, has been pursuing a North-South agreement, mindful that he cannot get too far ahead of his American ally. But his philosophy differs sharply from Mr. Bush's. He believes that the major problem with North Korea is that it is an insecure regime, and that he must change the atmosphere of confrontation.
"I think Kim is correct that the window is narrow," Senator Joseph R. Biden of Delaware, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said this evening. "I don't know whether what's on the other side of the window is worth it, but we sure should go and look."

HEADLINE: House Joins Senate in Repealing Rules on Workplace Injuries 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 7 

 BODY:
Moving with unusual speed, the House voted narrowly tonight to repeal new workplace safety regulations, just a day after the Senate voted to rescind the same rules. 
 This rapid one-two punch represented the first joint legislative attack on the legacy of President Bill Clinton, who issued the regulations in what he called an effort to combat the wave of injuries resulting from repetitive motions on the job. The White House announced support of the repeal on Tuesday, and lawmakers said they expected President Bush to sign the legislation soon. 
 Voting largely along partisan lines, the House backed the repeal bill, 223 to 206, with 16 Democrats voting to support the repeal. At the same time, 13 Republicans voted to keep the regulations. 
Like the 56-to-44 Senate vote on Tuesday to scrap the ergonomics rules, the House vote today was a major victory for business and a stinging defeat for organized labor, which had lobbied for 10 years for strong regulations to reduce ergonomic injuries. The Republican pushed through the business-backed repeal shortly after Mr. Bush upset many business interests by insisting he did not want corporate tax breaks to slow down his tax-cut proposal. 
Democratic lawmakers voiced outrage that the House voted to revoke the rules after just an hour of debate, even though Mr. Clinton adopted the regulations after 10 years of studies and a year of hearings. 
The House Democratic leader, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, said, "I have not in my entire time in the Congress seen such an awful example of rushing to the floor just a few months after an election and trying to get through special interest legislation." 
For their part, Republicans asserted that Mr. Clinton had rushed the rules into effect in his final months in office as a favor to labor groups.
Under the new rules, many companies would need to do little more than inform their employees about the risk of repetitive strain injury. At companies where one worker reports an injury, the employer could make a "quick fix" without putting a major program into effect. 
But if two employees report injuries within an 18-month period, companies have to carry out a broad program that calls for screening for ergonomic hazards and then taking steps to reduce those problems, like adjusting the height of assembly lines or restricting how often workers lift heavy weights. 
In the debate, Republicans said it could cost businesses more than $100 billion a year to comply with the regulations, causing layoffs and forcing many companies into bankruptcy. Democratic House members praised the rules, saying they would eliminate almost a third of the 1.8 million injuries, like tendinitis and back sprains, that American workers suffer each year as a result of repetitive motions at their jobs. 
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration said the regulations would cost businesses $4.5 billion and save them $9 billion a year by reducing injuries and sick days and increasing productivity.
The Capitol was swarming today with opponents and advocates of the regulations. Business lobbyists and corporate executives crowded into Republicans' news briefings while Democratic lawmakers showcased workers whose wrists, elbows and necks had been hurt. 
Representative Henry Bonilla, a Texas Republican who was a co-sponsor of the bill, said, "Repealing the ergonomics regulation will save small businesses billions of dollars that means fewer layoffs, less pay-cuts and economic growth." 
The House and Senate used an unusual legislative weapon, the Congressional Review Act of 1996, to repeal the rules. That act gives Congress a streamlined way of rescinding regulations less than 60 days old by strictly limiting debate and barring amendments and filibusters. President Clinton issued preliminary regulations in November, and the final rules took effect on Jan. 16, four days before Mr. Bush took office.
The act bars federal agencies from issuing regulations similar to those repealed under the act unless Congress approves them. Democrats said this could prevent OSHA from ever issuing strong ergonomics rules. 
"This is a death sentence for ergonomics rules," said Representative Robert E. Andrews, Democrat of New Jersey.
But Republicans insisted that they did not want to rule out having OSHA regulate ergonomic problems; they argued that this ergonomics rule was just bad and overreaching.
Representative Anne M. Northup, a Kentucky Republican who was the bill's other co-sponsor, said, "You're creating an enormously expensive regulation without true evidence of what we will get out of it. You're creating an enormous cost that will only have the effect of pushing jobs offshore."
Several Republicans said that Labor Secretary Elaine L. Chao's assertion on Tuesday that she was interested in a comprehensive approach to ergonomics might involve issuing a new rule.
Republicans said a rule to pay workers who suffer ergonomic injuries 90 percent of their normal pay for 90 days improperly superseded state workers compensation laws and would encourage the feigning of injuries.
Representative George Miller of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, condemned the vote, saying, "This is an assault on the American worker, and it's also an insult to the American worker." 
Republican lawmakers often argued that many corporations had voluntarily put into place programs to reduce injuries from repetitive tasks. But supporters of the rules said many companies had done little to protect against such injuries or education their workers about them.
